Each of the first four adds a little more to the grim story of Jason Voorhees until they come to their bloody (if temporary) finale in "The Final Chapter." I think everyone would agree, however, that despite the gimmick of 3-D, which was enjoying one of its brief revivals of interest back in '82, and despite the ususal undertone of silliness that marks all of these films, that Part III is a damned good slasher movie, and one which will go down in horror-movie history as the "one where Jason got his mask."<br /><br />Part III picks up almost immediately where Part II left off, with a wounded Jason Voorhees resuming his killing spree at a roadside convenience store run by a sadly likeable man and his shrilling hag wife. After this further reduction of the population of Crystal Lake, we are introduced to this movie's batch of victims: a husband-wife pair of stoners, a horny teen couple, an annoying prankster, a snobby-hot girl, a dudely-doorite with a torch for the troubled heroine, and the heroine herself. Via an incident at yet another roadside store, we also meet three Central Casting bikers who are dumb enough to think they will be the film's antagonists, but who merely present additional fodder for Jason's knife. All these unfortunates convene at Higgins' Hideaway, the ususal rustic house set beside the usual rustic barn. There's just one problem. Jason's in the barn!<br /><br />There obviously is no need to go into the plot. All F-13 films are essentially plot-free, the "story" merely being how each individual sucker will die at Jason's hands, and how the heroine (for it is almost always a girl, though sometimes she has male help) will ultimately put the pause button on Jason's crusade to curb teenage sex and marijuana abuse in Crystal Lake. In that regard the film delivers fairly well, beginning with more or less ordinary kills and ramping up to some truly savage acts of violence, not the least of which is one poor slob who gets a machete right through the crown jewels, and another whose head gets crushed like a rotten tomato in a vice.<br /><br />Now, I am only giving credit where it is due to say that some of these poor people are actually fairly well-drawn, and that the actors all do credible [or better] jobs of conveying their characters' limited personalities. I truly didn't want some of these folks to die, which of course adds to the suspense. What's more, the scene in which Jason finally appears with his newfound hockey mask is not only a piece of horror-movie history, it's also a damned effective piece of visual terrorism. And the movie's climax is just relentless, with the violently active Jason tearing the barn to pieces trying to get at our long-suffering heroine. There are a lot of real jumpy moments in this flick, a couple of nice in-jokes ("Fangoria" magazine, for example) and the shrieking musical score by Harry Manfredini only adds to the viewer's jangled nerves.<br /><br />To be sure the film has its problems. All slasher films, and FRIDAY films in particular, depend upon the extreme stupidity of the characters and their complete failure to exercise common sense or even rudimentary brain-function ("Go down to the cellar and check the fuse box.") Also on the audience's willingness to swallow a lot of preposterous occurances, some of which are just plain physically impossible. Part III is no exception. Nearly everyone in the movie is clueless, and their collective failure to notice the hulking murderer with the deformed head constantly walking in and out of a barn 30 feet from their house is cause for dismay. The fact that the Jason had a machete plunged halfway through his torso at the climax of Part II is not in much in evidence here either; since he doesn't become truly supernatural until Part VI, it's hard to explain how that wouldn't effect his performance, or how he survives some of the abuse he takes in this film while trying to put down the heroine. What's more, in regards to the need for greater acts of violence, I was personally offended by the choice of making one of the victims pregnant, and on top of that killing her via a red-hot poker through the belly. The dude in the wheelchair from "II" was bad enough, but a pregnant woman impaled on a poker? Come on, man. That's just vulgar.<br /><br />Having said that, this is my personal fave of all the FRIDAY films. If you can ignore the many gratuitous shots of yo-yos and cigarette butts and popcorn flying at the camera to show off a 3-D effect you can't see, this is definitely the slasher flick for you.</p></body></html>

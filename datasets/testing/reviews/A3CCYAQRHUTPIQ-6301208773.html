Influential enough to spawn  a genre of itself (even today, certain films are 'a bit like Die Hard'),  this film combined the '70s disaster movie with a fashionable set of chic  european bad guys and a plot which saw a lone hero use wit, courage and an  MP5 to defeat a numerically-superior opposing force. Put like that, the  film sounds merely adequate, but the beauty is in the execution - 'Die  Hard' is polished. It looks and sounds gorgeous, and is paced so that,  after a short introduction, it's constant action until the finale. It took  Bruce Willis a decade of solid work to step from the shadow of his John  McClane character. Only Willis' hair and the awful, awful trailer have  dated from 1988.</p></body></html>

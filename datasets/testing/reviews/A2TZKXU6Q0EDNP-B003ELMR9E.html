<meta name="summary" content="This wont put you to sleep..."></head><body><p>Allthough a lot of people avoided this film in the movie theaters (myself included) because of the rather dodgy choice of the casting Robin Williams as a killer, it appears that these fears were totally unjustified.<br />  Insomnia is a film that contributes nicely to a genre desperate gor oxygen, that of the old and classic "dtetective film".<br />  It works because it incorporates several interesting angles to keep you interested throughout as well as guessing.<br />  An Alaskan town as the setting for a murder case where an L.A detective is brought in? Nice touch.<br />  A killer not played by the usual baddies but by "Ms Doubtfire"-Robin Williams? Better touch even.<br />  A detective who cant seem to get any sleep under the never setting sun in Alaska even if his life depended on it? Good, really good.<br />  It's mainly those 3 axes that fuel the engine of this story and, of course, the superb acting of Pacino and even Williams who settles in his killer role incredibly convincingly. It wouldnt matter, in fact, how Pacino came across here had Williams not fit in with his role. The whole thing would've collapsed in ruins. <p>  But that's exactly it, Williams plays the loser-small-time-author-turned-killer perfectly and from there on it's a smooth ride all the way to the end.<br />  This is a film by dierctor Chritopher Nolan who filmed Memento and if u thought that Memento avoided any cliches so does Insomnia. Insomnia HAD to avoid the cliches because ths is genre that has gone stale exactly because it rode the cliches for far too long.<br />  Pacino's character is one that grows edgier every 5 minutes the film progresses no doubt NOT helped by his lack of sleep. He's also a character that has a lot on the line as he's been sent to Alaska because of internal tension in his department and because he's got a great reputation to protect.<br />  That reputation takes a huge dent as he winds up killing his partner in the case (by mistake? not? not sure) and this becomes the killer's leverage point in a way that provides for numerous twists.<br />  Williams's character is one that has become a murderer "because it happened" and he seems to have great adjustability potentials as he slips into his role like a snake would around its victim. Being the cornered animal since it's not going to be easy to remain unknown for long in the small Alaskan town environs he decides to turn this into a poker affair with the cop. As Pacino seems to either overtrust or simoultaneously underestimate his opponent the twists become weirder and better.<br /><br />  Much to the director's credit there's no clear-cut happy end.Had there been it would a classic case of the film that does well or great until the last 30 seconds when it all turns silly. Not the case here, the end is tense, believable, plausible and has the showdown touch the whole story has been yearning for.<br />  Refreshing and excellently filmed it reminded me how much i've missed good detective story-films.</p></body></html>

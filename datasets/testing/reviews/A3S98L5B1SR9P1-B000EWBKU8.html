<meta name="summary" content="Die Hard (1988)"></head><body><p>This movie set the standard for action flicks. With a mix of action and comedy, Bruce Willis broke the box office with this story of high rise adventure. While out in L.A. visiting his wife, New York cop John McClane finds himself in the middle of a terriorist takeover. Armed with only his Berreta and wise-cracks (and the enemies' cigarettes), he sets out to free his wife and the other hostages from the terrorists. This is a great action movie for the guys.</p></body></html>

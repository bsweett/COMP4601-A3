The series has been a wreck since then.  The Crystal Skull installment is possibly even worse than the awful Temple of Doom episode that was dragged down by Kate Capshaw and that little twerp "shortround".  In this case, its the horrible story (thanks to George Lucas) and the stiff performance by Harrison Ford that dooms this movie.  Neither one of these guys has done anything worthwhile in over a decade.  Steven Speilberg doesn't do much better with his unimaginitive direction.  He goes through the motions in a lame attempt to copy the previous movies.  The gag lines are poorly conceived and delivered and as a result that fall flat.  There isn't even a compelling villain.  A complete disappointment.</p></body></html>

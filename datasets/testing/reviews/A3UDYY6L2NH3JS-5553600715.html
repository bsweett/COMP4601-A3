<meta name="summary" content="The ghost is not the one you may think"></head><body><p>A ghost story that does not look like one. A quite acceptable situation, though rather bizarre, without being strange. Every detail is slightly surprising, or original but believable. The whole object of the film is to reverse the situation of the beginning to reveal the truth and those who seem normal and pretend they are haunted by some ghosts end up being the real ghosts. It all hinges around the paranoia of the mother. She is obsessed by something that makes her tense or angry in no time and for little. Till one day she breaks down completely when those they call the intruders take down all the curtains that are draping all the windows of the house. The end then is banal: the living intruders abandon the house in the hands of the dead ghosts. The interest of the film is this inverted situation, this upside down ghost story. Then we are irritated or bothered by the way they don't speak but only whisper, the way they are obsessed by keys and locked doors, by any sound that is not explainable from their sole point of view. Everything is done in nuances, discretely, hardly fully expressed. We have to navigate among these strange milestones or obstacles to finally understand the truth but only when it is revealed to us. A very effective film but a film that does not require a second viewing because it only works if we do not know the truth. We have to be fooled to enjoy the film.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I can't "baer" it!"></head><body><p>This is a wonderful movie; great story and great acting. One teensy-weensy problem though: I CAN'T STAND IT WHEN A MOVIE ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AND REAL HISTORY GRATUITOUSLY AND IRRESPONSIBLY DISTORTS THE FACTS FOR THE SAKE OF "DRAMA"! Max Baer was not anything like the evil monster depicted in this film. If his family isn't suing for defamation of character, they should be.<br /><br />Do any of you who rave about this film care about this, or is all forgiven for the sake of a good story? And don't think this travesty can be justified by the pathetic disclaimer at the end of the film about "fictionalizing some of the characters." Libel is by definition a fiction.</p></body></html>

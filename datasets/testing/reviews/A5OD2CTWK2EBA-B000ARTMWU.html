Oh yeah cant forget the Statue of Liberty, I guess thanks for that also. Anyway.<br /><br />I was forgetting that people are allowed to make R-Rated HORROR movies which is exactly what this is. This mnovie is extremely violent and extremely well done, as i rate nothing 5 stars but this movie does not have one flaw,IMO atleast. The only thing I didnt like was the fact that the movie went from being dubbed ( which bothered people also, I dont know why, I guess people need something to complain about )to subtitles. Basically half the movie is dubbed and the other half is in subtitles, but that in no way has anything to do with this flick and the way it was made, directed ,edited and acted out.<br /><br />This movie is no less than a true horror and a classic to be no question. The movie has a geat twist at the end ( which many didnt like, but this ending could have gone 2 ways, but im still satisfied with this one ), and with the ending giving me goose bumps ( The very last scene ).<br /><br />This whole movie is sick and twisted and gives you a ride of non-stop violence and pure terror-suspense through out the whole film. Plus one of the main things I had mentioned to my friend only 10-15 minutes into the movie is the music which is very creepy and sets a great mood to this movie.<br /><br />To see something like this lets me know there are still some true fans and/or film makers/writters who know what horror is, and this movie is a prime example.<br /><br />There is no humor at all in this movie, which is what I love something made to make you jump which the 4 or 5 scenes that are suppose to make you jump do in fact make you jump.<br /><br />Horrors need to be made like this i give 100% kudos and respect to this film maker for giving us fans horror like it should be.</p></body></html>

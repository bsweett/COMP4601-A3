<meta name="summary" content="The Iron Lady"></head><body><p>Every once in a while, a movie comes along that will compel me to say, "It's worth seeing for the acting alone," and if ever there was a prime example of this phenomenon, it was last year's The Iron Lady. In The Iron Lady, Meryl Streep plays former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with the same chameleonic grace she harnessed for her portrayal of Julia Child in 2009's Julie & Julia. Told primarily in flashback, Phyllida Lloyd's portrait begins in Thatcher's youth, then traces her rise to power and chronicles her involvement in certain key historical events. To get a sense of my opinion of the film, consider the following: Lloyd's only other feature directorial effort, 2008's ABBA-themed musical Mamma Mia, is actually better The Iron Lady, but for her work on the latter, Streep took home Best Actress honors from the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Academy Awards. In other words, The Iron Lady is worth seeing for the acting alone.</p></body></html>

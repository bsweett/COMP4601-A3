<meta name="summary" content="Great comeback!"></head><body><p>Superman is my favorite superhero, and this was a great and honrable comeback for the man of steel!  Way to go, Bryan Singer.  Admittedly, when the familiar theme song and familiar opening credits to Superman Returns began, my heart fell a little to see the names Christopher Reeves, Margot kidder and Gene Hackman replaced by Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey.  But it's time to let go.  The torch has been passed.<br /><br />Superman comes back after spending five years in Space looking for remnants of his home planet Krypton.  He returns to Earth after finding nothing and also discovers that life on Earth has gotten along without him.  Lois lane has a five-year-old boy and practically engaged.<br /><br />From this point, the movie jumps right into the plot without explaining too much of Clark Kent's absence and presses forward.  Really no need to do a re-hash of Superman's background.  Bryan Singer takes this story on a more emotional journey that surprisingly both Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth do pretty well.  On top of that, Bryan Singer refines in outstanding special effects what Richard Donner started in  1978.  Expect more graceful, vertical shots of Superman flying as well as beautiful twilight cinematography.  Witness a sonic boom when he shoots up into the air or creating ripples as he darts across the water's surface.<br /><br />As the movie goes along and we've become used to seeing Superman's familiar life-saving strokes, the story becomes more interesting...in fact, very interesting.  I never thought I'd say this, but there is a scene towards the end of the movie that is somewhat of a tearjerker.  Bryan Singer shows his ability to tug at heartstrings as well as put out some great action.  Last time I saw that was X-men 2.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this film was made with a sense of grace and reverence for the world's oldest superhero.  Definitely a must see.</p></body></html>

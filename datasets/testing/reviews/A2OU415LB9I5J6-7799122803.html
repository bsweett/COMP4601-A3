Even if you're not adapting a work that is particularly well known among the masses you have to look at how the source material speaks to you and what you want to say to the audience with your film. Beyond that you have to consider what you possibly might need to change in your adaptation to make the source more cinematically viable. If you're working on a project that is ingrained in the public consciousness, or adapted previously into a universally adored film, then the line you walk can feel like the green mile.<br /><br />Tim Burton has had a lot of experience with film adaptations, making massive hits with Batman, Batman Returns, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which is not a remake, but that's a discussion for another blog post). He's also at times shown a capacity for not really understanding the source material. For his adaptation of Alice in Wonderland for Disney Burton said, "It's a funny project. The story is obviously a classic with iconic images and ideas and thoughts. But with all the movie versions, well, I've just never seen one that really had any impact to me. It's always just a series of weird events. Every character is strange and she's just kind of wandering through all of the encounters as just a sort of observer," but such observations ignore that this was Lewis Carroll's intention in his writing. In the end though, Burton's film became only the sixth film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide.<br /><br />Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 years old and on the verge of getting engaged to a man she doesn't love. But when she sees a white rabbit she feels compelled to follow it down the rabbit hole (so to speak). When she arrives in Wonderland, a place that she has been to before but doesn't remember, she's confronted by various creatures telling her that she's the wrong Alice. Soon she learns that on the fateful Frabjous Day she is supposed to become the champion of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and slay the Jabberwocky to restore the kingdom from the clutches of the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).<br /><br />Tim Burton has a tendency to view the world through dark shades. If Armani made a pair of gothic sunglasses they would belong to Burton. For a film like Alice and Wonderland which is known for its bright Day-Glo colors he might not seem like the right choice to direct, but in the end his style works well for his interpretation of the source material. You still have the bright colors and Burton retains some of the tones of outrageous zaniness that were present in the Carroll stories and in previous incarnations of the tale.<br /><br />A relative newcomer to the Hollywood stage, Wasikowska is the biggest acting surprise of the movie. She adds a certain gravitas that grounds the flick when it could have easily been lost in its excesses, and it could serve Wasikowska far beyond films of this nature. Helena Bonham Carter (whose casting in Burton films has been blamed on nepotism) steals every scene that she's in. She's typically brilliant and the choice to not hold back in this particular performance allows her to reign as an evil queen should. I must make a note here on Johnny Depp who more than a few people have made a note that he seems to be unable to properly act anymore without donning crazy makeup and disguises. Here I feel that the Mad Hatter he plays was taken in a hopelessly dark direction that should have been lightened up quite a bit more. Although watching the film I did look forward to his "Scottish" freak outs.<br /><br />There's a certain detachment from the material of the movie though. I don't really feel that Burton actually invested much of himself into this flick the way he did with, say, Nightmare on Elm Street or Ed Wood. His view of the world here, that imagination builds confidence, feels generic at the end of the day as if he were a hired hand who felt the need to put his stamp on the film out of necessity rather than artistically. The animation borders on ironic, which in 2D works quite well, but didn't hold up as well in the initial 3D viewing. Also, I felt the end was compromised slightly by the Mad Hatter's Futterwacken which seemed a bit too modern styled to fit with the rest of the narrative. In the end it just ended up being corny.<br /><br />Critically, this turned out to be Burton's third least enjoyed films among critics. (Planet of the Apes being his critical worst and Mars Attacks! which I think is underrated, not being far behind.) That's interesting considering Tim Burton only has three films that are considered by Rotten Tomatoes to be rotten. In my humble but honest opinion this is far from Burton's best film, but it's also not that close to being his worst film. I recommend you give it a try if you haven't already. It's a fun flick even if it isn't quite as perfect as I, or even some of you, wanted it to be.<br /><br />3.5/5<br /><br />Be sure to check out: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K7WZ7S">Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work</a>!</p></body></html>

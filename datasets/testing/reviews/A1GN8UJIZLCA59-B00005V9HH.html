<meta name="summary" content="Not The Usual Thriller"></head><body><p>Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a brilliantly crafted thriller that leads the viewer through a roller coaster ride of twists and plot turns.  The film marked the breakout of Kevin Spacey and helped him become a big star and win the first of his two Oscars.  The cast is full of superb actors including Gabriel Byrne, Benecio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Pete Postelwaithe, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Espinosa and elicits a strong performance from the normally cringe inducing Stephen Baldwin.  The interplay between Mr. Spacey and Mr. Palminteri is the centerpiece of the film as the story unfolds in a flashback manner.  Mr. Palminteri is a cop who is grilling Mr. Spacey regarding a drug deal gone bad aboard a ship.  Throughout the story, the name of the mysterious Keyser Soze comes up and it is the identity of Mr. Soze that adds suspense and intrigue to the plot.  The ending is a true surprise and you really don't see coming even the clues are there all along. The Usual Suspects will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></body></html>

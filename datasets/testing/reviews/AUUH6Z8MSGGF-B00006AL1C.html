<meta name="summary" content="The definitive Back to the Future Collection!"></head><body><p>3 Blu-ray Discs, 3 Digital Copy Discs, released October 26, 2010<br /><br />The "Back to the Future" trilogy of movies was directed by Robert Zemeckis and written and directed by Zemeckis with Bob Gale. It was produced by Steven Spielberg and along with the first movie inspiring a sequel split up into two movies, an animated series, and a Universal Studios ride (which can be watched as an extra in this set!).<br /><br />Michael J. Fox played Marty McFly, a high schooler with a girlfriend named Jennifer played by Claudia Wells and a family that is less than successful. Marty is friends with a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd who has invented time travel with the use of a DeLorean! Marty accidentally goes back in time thirty years and runs into his future parents played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover as high schoolers and almost screws up them meeting and getting together. In the first film, he has to find a way to set things straight for history while helping his dad face a bully named Biff played by Thomas F. Wilson and get back to the future.<br /><br />In the second movie, Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc go to the future to the year 2015 where there are flying cars and other weird stuff to prevent Marty and Jennifer's son from making a big mistake. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, future Marty, Marty's son, and Marty's daughter. Most other cast members returned except for Crispin Glover whose demands were too high for another film and he was recast by Jeffrey Weissman and Jennifer Parker was recast with Elisabeth Shue due to Claudia Wells having personal family problems and dropping out of acting for a while. The main conflict is that future Biff finds out about the time machine and takes a sports almanac back to his past self to become a millionaire in 1985 when Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc return to it. After facing an "It's a Wonderful Life" Pottersville horror scenario with Biff, Marty and the Doc go back to 1955 again to set things right.<br /><br />In the third movie, Doc is accidentally sent to 1885 and Marty goes back to the old west to rescue him. He meets Irish ancestors and ends up in a showdown with Mad Dog Tannen (another incarnation of Biff because no one in the town of Hill Valley ever leaves). This one just feels like an excuse to make a fun western, but it also lets Doc Brown have a love story with Clara played by Mary Steenburgen.<br /><br />This is a classic, iconic movie series. Clearly, the first movie is the best because it is the most relatable, wanting to see your parents at your age and the charming story that goes with it and how it all magically ties together. Even though the other two movies were well thought out and planned for elements to tie in, it was never quite as special. It is a little more forced and the subplot of Marty never being able to react well to someone calling him "chicken" (or "yellow" in the third film) seemed more immature than I thought Marty was portrayed in the first film. The original "Back to the Future" is arguably one of the most memorable and influential movies of the last 25 years and is always a feel-good one to watch.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There are three parts of a six part series on the making of the Back to the Future trilogy. You learn soooo much about the process, casting, and what it was like with Michael J. Fox's schedule recording for television during the day and for the movies at night and getting very little sleep. It is fascinating to learn how the story came together by putting events on index cards to make sure everything tied together smoothly. There are bunches of deleted scenes that mostly gave unnecessary exposition and extra jokes that took up more time than needed.<br /><br />Beyond those features are archival featurettes: On Disc One, "The Making of Back to the Future", Making the Trilogy: Chapter One, and "Back to the Future" Night where Leslie Nielsen hosts a playing of the movie on TV with interludes about how the film was made and preview footage of the sequel AND the Huey Lewis and the News "Power of Love" Music Video. On Disc Two, there is "The Making of Back to the Future Part II and Making the Trilogy: Chapter Two. On Disc Three is "The Making of Back to the Future Part III", "Making the Trilogy: Chapter Three", "The Secrets of the Back to the Future Trilogy", the music video "Doubleback" by ZZ Top who appear in the film, and Back to the Future: The Ride that you can watch.<br /><br />The Q&A with Michael J. Fox goes over some of the information already covered in the Making Of Series, but fills in a lot of blanks about makeup, crew, working with the car, etc. Every answer is set up with a visual zooming in and then zooming out which gets jarring when you hit "play all", and otherwise is a great feature on this set. For audio extras, you can listen to Q&A commentary with director/writer Robert Zemeckis and producer/writer Bob Gale on all three films. It is one session broken up into three parts, but they are not feature-length commentaries. They go more into detail about why certain actors were recast and how stories came about and situations with producers, etc. There is also feature commentary with producers Bob Gale and Neil Canton on all three films.<br /><br />In the Behind the Scenes feature on Disc One, you can watch original make-up tests, outtakes, photo galleries, and watch the storyboards version of the nuclear power plant scene that was cut in favor of the watch tower story with and without producer commentary. The deleted scenes involve embellishing story to emphasize ideas we already know (Marty's dad is a loser, etc.) as well as "showstoppers" which stop the movie to have some jokes. On Disc Two, there are outtakes, production design, storyboarding, designing the DeLorean, designing Time Travel, a Hoverboard test, evolution of the visual effects shots, and photo galleries. On Disc Three, you can watch more outtakes, designing the town of Hill Valley, designing the campaign, and photo galleries.</p></body></html>

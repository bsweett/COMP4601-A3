<meta name="summary" content="A Little Too Graphic"></head><body><p>"Sin City" is a black and white film recreation of Frank Miller's b and w graphic novels with every so often a vivid swath of colored eyes, blood, or some villainous single color. Someone's blue eyes will appear in stark color and thrust themselves at the viewer. The stories are grim, gritty, morose, tough-minded. There's plenty of action, violence, and the scenes are set up to resemble the comic book world, a close approximation of what you would see in a graphic novel. Quentin Tarantino was involved as a guest director so you know what to expect. Computer enhancement was used. Many of the scenes are evocations of the graphic novel drawings--turning the static page into the kinetic world.<br /> There are really three stories melded together, each section with its own hero played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen. The first and third parts come together near the end.<br /> The movie will make you uncomfortable, queasy, squirrely at times with its gritty realism, humorlessness, and starkness. The flick doesn't let up and give you a chance to breathe but keeps on its violent inevitable avenging pace. It's a melodrama gone spastic and ballistic. The avalanche of fateful action goes rolling on and buries the viewer who just hopes to come up for an occasional breath of fresh air. It's a claustrophobic, insular, crushing atmosphere.<br /> We're lucky all movies aren't made at this breakneck pace and with this intensitry, grittiness, and sense of futile inevitability. It's crime and punishment, avenging forces, and anti-heroes fighting against incredible odds. A movie for people with specialized tastes, but a worthy experiment.</p></body></html>

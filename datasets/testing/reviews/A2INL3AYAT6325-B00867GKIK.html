<meta name="summary" content="Another good film from Disney/Pixar"></head><body><p>This film is another success for Disney/Pixar.<br /><br />Thankfully, they are different than the rest.  They come up with original ideas.<br /><br />Beautiful animation.<br /><br />A disappointment-NO GOOD MUSIC.  Remember when Disney films had good music/songs?  Sure miss those days.  Memorable songs?  Oscar winning songs?  Those were the days.<br /><br />This has the digital copy.  Good idea, but I would like to see some different extras like Disney used to.  More information on the film, showing more in depth stuff.<br /><br />NO chapter list, you just do NOT get these anymore & I want them.<br /><br />And, Disney/Pixar, why the horrible flip the little flap DVD case/holder?  Now, I looked at the single disc DVD & IT DID NOT HAVE THIS HORRIBLE FEATURE, SO WHY DOES THE MORE EXPENSIVE HAVE THIS.  Hate them.<br /><br />And, the Ellie character.  Did the younger, adult Ellie not look like Helen from The Incredibles?</p></body></html>

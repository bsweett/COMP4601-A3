<meta name="summary" content="Good movie with a bit of dramatic license"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey acts, directs and sings in this movie about the life of Bobby Darin. The movie starts off in an almost sureal manner as Bobby is singing in a club but then, it turns out that this "club" is actually a movie set with Bobby acting as himself in a movie about himself. The young boy, acting as the young Bobby Darin looks on and acts as a backdrop to the entire movie. Spacey's singing is surprisingly good. It is certainly more than passable and he deserves a lot of credit taking that risk because if the attempt had fallen short, the entire movie would have fallen flat on it's face. Instead, Spacey pulled it off.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had was that Spacey is about ten years older than Darin was when he died and a good 20 years older than he was during key parts of the movie. Although Spacey looked like Darin, in subtle ways you could tell he was the middle aged Spacey, not the young Darin. This may be the only drawback to the movie because, quite frankly, Spacey was almost uncanny in the role. I was a fan of Babby Darin and I believe that the movie captures the essence of the Darin that I remember.<br /><br />I see some dramatic license that was taken but, that's OK if it ultimately assists in the telling of the story of the subject's life. Later in life, Darin became a fighter for liberal causes and dropped his flashy club image for a more laid back, jeans wearing, folk singing image. The movie makes it seem as though during this change, he sank nearly to obscurity. In fact, Darin was still in the forefront with a huge folk hit; a recording of Tim Hardin's "If I Were a Carpenter." Also, the movie makes it appear that he had a big comeback concert in Las Vegas right before he died. In fact, although short lived, he had a television variety series and he had a fairly extended run in Las Vegas. I accept the license that was taken and, therefore, enjoyed the movie.</p></body></html>

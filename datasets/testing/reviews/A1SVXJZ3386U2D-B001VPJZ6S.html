That's too bad because I might have been a bit more receptive to the characters portrayed in this movie.  In my mid 50's I find myself a bit stretched to buy into them.  Allowing somewhat for my aged perspective, I could tell from the dialogue and interaction between the high schoolers that the writers were looking at exploring relationships at an age when they are most volitile.  Overall, this works pretty well.  My problem is that we had a group of 5 kids who each filled a different high school stereotype; the jock, the hood, the nerd, the homecoming queen, and the misfit nobody likes.  How uncanny that they all were so diverse from one another.  Wouldn't life in high school have been easier if the numbers had so nicely evened out?  If we could have always gone one on one?  I admit that I didn't care for the three boys to two girls ratio but otherwise I'm sure I could have handled high school a lot better with those odds.  The problem never was individuals; it was groups of liked minded individuals who preyon on, mocked or simply ignored other "lesser" groups.  I realize that the writer/director John Hughes chose this format to escape those limitations.  Unfortunately, reality never was that convenient.<br /><br />High school has always been a tough time for most kids.  Unfortunately, even the ones who sailed through with popularity often found that those were life's highlights; what came after never seemed to match it.  Most of us learned valuable lessons that we only understood later but getting through the roller coaster didn't always seem worth it at the time.  I acknowledge that these feeling were, at times, excellently put on display in "The Breakfast Club".  However, each time the soul searching looked like it was going to touch a nerve, uncovered a hidden reality, or display honest sincerity, we suddenly found out it was all the fault of lousy parenting.  What a cop out! (to borrow a phrase from my high school days).  All authority  in "The Breakfast Club" is, by far, more dysfunctional that these hormone-crazed teenagers; was this supposed to be a comedy?  Still, the "discoveries" were hard-earned and we went through a lot of emotion and thought to get there.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good movie.  As you can tell, it took me back to my high school days.  I watched it with my 8th grade son who got interested when he heard the opening song.  We saw a cleaned-up version but there was still a lot of serious stuff in the movie.  I couldn't tell if he got a lot out of the movie but he didn't get up from his chair til it was finished.  I rated this movie 4 stars because, despite my objections, I felt Hughes made a valient effort.</p></body></html>

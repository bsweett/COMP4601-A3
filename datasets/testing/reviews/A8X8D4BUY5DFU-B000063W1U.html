<meta name="summary" content="great cgi"></head><body><p>Superb CGI, excellent actors, especially Brendan Fraser,  a very good role for him as a more macho Indiana Jones type character. Humor was subdued but omnipresent.  Horror was not excessively gruesome, even occasionally humorous. An enjoyable series.  The sequels are more action and CGI; less character development, believable plot, and humor. On the whole, above average entertainment. The first is the best for Egyptiologists.</p></body></html>

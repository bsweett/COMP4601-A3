<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good ....BUT ?"></head><body><p>This was pretty good film.<br /><br />It is easy to see alot of work went into it....BUT... something just does not "click".<br /><br />...and I don't know exactly what it is.<br /><br />It almost feels like everybody is walking thru the scenes as visualized in the storyboards, but in a "mechanical" sort of way if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Unlike some DVDs you eiher want to buy and add to your collection, or at least talk/think about afterwards... X-Men 3 came across as 110 minutes of good entertainment that you forget about as soon as it goes back in the Blockbuster rental case.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Three hours of epic spectacle is a must-see"></head><body><p>It seems like every couple of months there's a new film hyped as an epic--but they rarely live up to the billing. Such is the case with "Troy," which is based on Homer's story "The Illiad."<br />Most incarnations of this story have been devoted to the love affair between Trojan Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom, "Pirates of the Caribbean") and Spartan Queen Helen (Diana Kruger, "Michael Valiant"), which sparked the decade-long war between the Trojans and Greeks. But screenwriter David Benioff ("The 25th Hour") focuses this saga on the warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind").<br />Casting Pitt in the role of Achilles seemed odd for a number of reasons, not the least of which is Pitt's boy-next-door looks. He could have just as easily been cast as Trojan general Hector--played magnificently by Eric Bana ("Hulk")--as in the role of the brooding, glory-hunting Achilles.<br />Maybe Warner Bros. figured the best way to attract women to a film that has enough bloodshed to make Quentin Tarantino jealous would be to cast Pitt parading around barely clothed. (I've seen so much of Brad Pitt now that I felt like I should apologize to his (then) wife, Jennifer Aniston.)<br />But Pitt is an incredible actor and he easily pulls off making Achilles a multidimensional character.<br />Some noticeable changes were made to Homer's version of the story, such as who killed whom and at what point in the story, but the dramatic intensity of the film greatly benefits from these changes.<br />The opening battle scene with the Greeks storming the Trojan beach seemed like a swords and spears version of Stephen Spielberg's opening to "Saving Private Ryan," while other battle scenes recalled Mel Gibson's "Braveheart."<br />Unlike those war-theme epics, however, director Wolfgang Petersen ("The Perfect Storm") had the luxury of a main event battle that would make boxing promoter Don King envious, with Achilles squaring off against Hector.<br />Other principal characters of "The Illiad" are peripheral faces in Petersen's "Troy" as he builds to this clash of titans. As Achilles mows down wave after wave of Trojan soldiers, Hector defeats scores of Greek soldiers and generals before his inevitable conflict with Achilles.<br />"Troy" boasts an excellent supporting cast, with Brian Cox ("The Bourne Identity") as head Greek general Agamemnon, Sean Bean ("The Lord of the Rings") as Achilles' closest friend Odysseus, the legendary Peter O'Toole ("Imperium: Augustus") as Troy's King Priam and Bloom, who continues making wise career moves.<br />What keeps "Troy" from becoming an epic is that sense of awe and amazement of watching a film like "Saving Private Ryan" in witnessing the atrocities of war, or "Braveheart," which features memorable speeches that make your spine tingle. There is no lavish, lush scenery as the battlegrounds are fought on desolate, arid plains.<br />No, "Troy" is all about the action, and in that sense it has more in common with Russell Crowe's "Gladiator," another total adrenaline-rush film that doesn't bother with looking pretty or sounding preachy.<br />The action scenes are tremendous and the setup and battle between Achilles and Hector is moviemaking at its best. Petersen delivers on the hype for the film's main event and wisely speeds through the rest of the story (The Trojan Horse, Achilles' fate, etc.).<br />Petersen doesn't waste scenes, and with a story this immense in scope, the length is reasonable and the pace moves briskly so that it barely feels like a three-hour film.<br />Teachers who are looking for a way to get their students into Greek mythology have a new tool for making learning exciting--despite the liberties taken with the story. And action fans have a new film to add to their must-see movie list.</p></body></html>

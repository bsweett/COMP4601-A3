If you pick a DVD with the name Schwarzenegger in bold letters at the top then you know that the talent level is very low, but it will be explosive and entertaining.  `Total Recall' is just that.  The acting and plotting and general storytelling aspects of this film are marginally successful, with moments of full blown ridiculousness, but the film is exciting in all the right areas and it maintains a level of cleverness that will keep you glued.  The graphics are top notch (if not a tad on the cheesy side at times) for the time period in which this was made, and the action sequences are all pretty fun.  As far as the story is concerned, well a lot of Arnold's films seemed to be cut from the same mold, and this is no different.  Still, if you have a lazy Sunday afternoon prepared for it, `Total Recall' can bring with it a fairly good time.</p></body></html>

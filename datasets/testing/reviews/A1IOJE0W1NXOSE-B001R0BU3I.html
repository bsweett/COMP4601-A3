He plays a Muslim named Samir Horn and the story begins in his birthplace of Yemen when he sees his father blown up by terrorists.  The action switches from the middle-East to the U.S. as FBI agents begin<br />pursuing the adult Samir who appears to be moving closer and closer to the center of a terrorist cell.  Throughout the movie Samir is portrayed as a devout Muslim, intent on living out his faith.  Cheadle makes the character believable and memorable.  Throughout the movie there is doubt as to which side Samir is on and the action is portrayed in shades of gray instead of black and white.  This is a fast-moving, entertaining, and interesting movie.</p></body></html>

It is a wonder how fine film making can still cause a skeptical viewer to suspend disbelief and catch a tangible emotional and physical sense of the unbearable tension and palm-sweating fear of being centerstage amid barely supressed hostility from a local population made up of the friendly, the indifferent and the murderous.  In short, she has created a chair-gripping intensity and her close-in camera work puts us right in the middle of the tension.<br /><br />Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who imbedded with an actual Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, waste no time getting us into the midst of the tension and action that is an everyday commonplace for these exceptional individuals.  Two surviving members of a team that has lost its leader get a hairy and wary introduction to the style and methods of their new team leader, Sgt. James (Jeremy Renner).  A gifted bomb disposer with a seemingly fearless daring, his teammates Sgt. Sanborn and Spc.Eldridge are more concerned that he is a "cowboy" that may increase the danger to themselves, which is already considerable.  They are operating in pure survival mode, while their new boss seems to be in a different, potentially dangerous, mental and emotional zone.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner's Sgt. James is not an easy read either.  Is his daring approach really recklessness or does he have a more realistic assessment of the danger and the odds?  Is he simply an adrenaline junky that gets off on the fear and pressure, or is he an accomplished professional that has found his calling and his talent and simply realizes that death is always present, and that error is fatal no matter what precautions are taken?  As has been noted by nearly every reviewer, Renner's portrait of this man is subtle and nuanced and brilliantly achieved.  He is nicely complimented by the work of Anthony Mackie (Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (Eldridge).<br /><br />Likewise, these three young leads are ably supported by Bigelow and Boal, who have created an unsentimental script that wastes no time in preaching or in sidetrips or extraneous scenes that do nothing to illuminate these men and the situation they find themselves in.  With a, thank God, absence of pontificating, moral pronouncements, and political bias, they let the sweaty terror of where these men have to work and what they have to do speak volumes about the ambiguity of this war and any other.  This is nasty business, and the tangible hostility of death arriving from any balcony, around any corner, or in any trap is always readily present and felt.<br /><br />This is brilliant film making, up close and personal in its execution and allowing a terrific showcase for the young talented actors involved.  Yes, there are cameos by David Morse, Guy Pearce, Ralph Feinnes and Evangeline Lily, but they are just that, cameos.  The bulk of this film rests on the shoulders of Renner, Mackie and Geraghty and they are superb.  I've been a longtime fan of Kathryn Bigelow from her Near Dark debut, through her hits and misses, although even the latter have often demonstrated her energy and chops as an action director.  Here she has married that talent to a fine script written by someone who knows what he's writing about, and the result is a fine film with a subtle subtext and arguably one of the best pictures to emerge from the Iraq war.  It should be seen.</p></body></html>

After studiously avoiding the pseudo-literary claptrap that is Dan Brown's sacriledge-in-print, wouldn't you just know it?  My "women's group" dragged me to see it.  I knew I shouldn't have joined that group, I basically got conned into it (but that's another story).  I will admit to having taken frequent toilet breaks (even when I didn't have to go) in order to miss more of the movie.  Folks, I even tried to doze off but this annoying group member, Joyce, kept smacking her gum too loudly.<br /><br />Tom Hanks has let me down, especially after a movie liked "Road To Perdition" which was wondrous.  Ron Howard, well, I always regarded him as a flyweight filmmaker - and this time out, he's underweight even for that class.  This movie is detestable and I don't want to "spoil" it for anyone who actually cares, so I won't elaborate on plot details.  The movie was long, slow, and boring.  It also is highly insulting to Christains like I proudly count myself as.  Piece.</p></body></html>

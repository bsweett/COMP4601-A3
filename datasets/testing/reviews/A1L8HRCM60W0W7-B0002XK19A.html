<meta name="summary" content="HIGH-OCTANE THRILLER WITH A HEART: SUMPTUOUS!"></head><body><p>As close to perfect as a sequel can be, SM2 covers all its bases with an effortless mix of moods.<br /><br />One minute, some mind-blowing FX are turning your knuckles white with heart-thumping application of digital dolby, then suddenly you see that thrill casually offset by some cheeky humor or some humane spotlight on relationships. None of which ends up too sappy.<br /><br />Barring a stray cheesy moment or two that sneaked in (e.g., the final 5 minutes that slyly burrow a small hole to fit a Part 3 in), I don't have enough praise for this absolutely dazzling summer spectacular for your entire family! A must-watch and when it's out on DVD, a must-own.</p></body></html>

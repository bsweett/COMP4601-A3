<meta name="summary" content="Back To Its Roots"></head><body><p>Despite the fact that the first Star Trek motion picture rekindled an interest in the show, there existed a disconnect between the style/feel of the Original Series TV show and the style/feel of the first movie.  In The Wrath of Khan, however, the focus shifts back to what made the show a success in the first place: great acting and character developement, subtle humor, action/adventure scenes, and some thought-provoking concepts.<br /><br />In this film, a few members of the U.S.S. Enterprise stumble across an old nemesis from the TV show...Khan, a ruthless dictator who will stop at nothing to get his revenge on Captain Kirk, the man who imprisoned him.  At the same time, Kirk is struggling with his advancing age, coming to terms with the fact that he will not be a starship captain forever.  The final showdown between Kirk and Kahn will have you on the edge of your seating, rooting for the swashbuckling Kirk more than ever before.<br /><br />This movie also does a great job of showcasing the "auxiliary" characters (Uhura, Chekhov, Sulu, Scotty, etc.), who more often than not got the short end of the spool in the TV show.<br /><br />For devoted fans of the show, the final scene is likely the most gut-wrenching of any movie or TV episode, as fan-favorite Spock must make a split-second decision that will alter his life forever.<br /><br />To conclude, if you are just beginning your voyage through the Star Trek universe (and don't have time to watch all the episodes), this is the film you want to start with, as it remains true to the ideals/concepts that made Star Trek such a cultural phenomena.  For those of you who watched the first Star Trek film and were disappointed, take heart, as this film will have you running to your local video store to check out the next installment in the series.</p></body></html>

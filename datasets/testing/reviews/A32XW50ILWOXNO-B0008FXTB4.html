<meta name="summary" content="Cool? More like lukewarm."></head><body><p>"Be Cool" is unmoored from reality - it envisions the music business as a creation straight out of Wyatt Earp's Tombstone - hired guns, rote murders, amiable cops tossed aside in favor of street enforcers. It is, thankfully, a funny movie in bits and pieces, which is as much a testament to Elmore Leonard's book, upon which the movie is based, than anything the performers or director F. Gary Gray bring to the production.<br /><br />The movie is a sequel to "Get Shorty" and reintroduces us to John Travolta as Chili Palmer, the Brooklyn wiseguy who in the first movie exercised his brute charm and mob connections to a career in the film industry. "Get Shorty" was a smarter, dirtier film, with a coherent plot and a director (Barry Sonnenfeld - where'd he go?) wise in the ways of black humor. "Be Cool" has been cut off at the knees - PG-13 goes with gangster like Tang accompanies filet mignon - and features one of those detached, bemused Travolta performances where he sags on the couch, squints and lights cigarettes.<br /><br />Chili is ushered into the tune game rudely - he watches a buddy (James Woods, in cameo) get blasted by a Russian loan shark. Seems the buddy was trying to get cash to buyout the contract of one Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a tiny black diva managed by a giant white fool named Raji (Vince Vaughn). Raji, played with mixture of goof and childlike menace by Vaughn, is one of the chief pleasures of film, a wannabe pimp so far lost in hip-hop lingo and gesture that he seems to forgotten the completely perfect bowl of hair smeared in sweat to his head. So is The Rock as Raji's gay bodyguard, one eye on Linda, one on the kind of showbiz career Chili can promise.<br /><br />There are at least three other sides to this overstuffed cast: Cedric the Entertainer is is a Suge Knight type with a Harvard degree; Andre 3000 as the Suge-type's bodygurard; Harvey Keitel is a record label owner playing both sides; and Uma Thurman is the dead guy's wife. What an odd role for Thurman to accept - a fraidycat former groupie, opposite completely from her "Kill Bill" series. At least she looks fab.<br /><br />"Be Cool" knows very little about the real music business. The day will not come when a girl without a single skimps onstage with Aerosmith for a Steven Tyler duet. Dueling record moguls don't stand around on street corners issuing ultamatums for a wad of cash when a lawsuit would suffice. This is the cartoon version, and the cartoon characters - Vaughn, The Rock, Andre 3000, even Steven Tyler - stick out. The mellower gang of Travolta, Thurman and Keitel drag. And Milian, as Linda Moon, can belt a note, all right, but "Be Cool" does not reveal her as a movie star.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man......"></head><body><p>Superhero movies seem to be the rage these days. With movies like Iron Man, I can see why. Not that I'm complaining. If you've read enough of my reviews lately, you'll see I'm quite a big comic book fan myself so it is great news for me. True, I'm an admitted DC fanboy but I, occasionally, get into Marvel Comics as well. Honestly, though, I've never been into Iron Man as much as I have others like Blade, The Punisher, Ghost Rider, Wolverine, Iron Fist and Doctor Strange. You can tell by my favorites there that I'm into the darker, more twisted likes of Marvel's gallery. Yet, after seeing Iron Man, I've decidedly thought about purchasing his comic on a regular basis now. The movie is about Tony Stark. A wealthy industrialist who is kidnapped to build a destructive weapon for the enemy. If things weren't bad enough, shrapnel works its way near his heart and the only thing keeping him alive is a small electromagnetic generator installed in his chest.  Instead of building the weapon for the enemy, he builds a fantastic suit of armor to escape by. After escaping, he decides to turn his life and company around much to the disappointment of Obadiah Stane(his second in command at Stark Industries). Obadiah wants complete control over Stark Industries, even if it means wiping out Tony Stark and that's when things start to get interesting. Without giving too much away, let's just say things get wayyy more interesting from that point.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, Iron Man is Marvel's first movie into more 'serious' material. Not one time in the movie did I find things too unbelievable or fantastical as some of their previous movies led me to feel. Even though I actually loved The Dark Knight and know that some things in that movie could actually happen, this movie made it more believable for me.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau; the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges. Extras include:Trailers(Star Trek, Indiana Jones & The Incredible Hulk), Deleted/Extended Scenes, Iron Man: Armored Adventures(which is a preview of the animated Iron Man series that will air next year on Nicktoons), I am Iron Man(which is a documantary of the making of the movie), The Invincible Iron Man(which is a featurette detailing the creation of Iron Man to his present day interpretation), Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man(which is self-explanatory), Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test, The Actor's Process(a four minute rehearsal with Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Jon Favreau),  The Onion "Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into a Full-Length Film(a two and a half minute parody of a news report) and Galleries(Three picture galleries which allow you to see the movie through photos).<br /><br />All in all, Iron Man is a wildly believable and fun ride.</p></body></html>

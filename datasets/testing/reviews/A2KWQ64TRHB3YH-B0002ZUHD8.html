<meta name="summary" content="Plenty of battle scenes for a Roman Arthur"></head><body><p>This Director's Cut DVD is one of those films that says, "It didn't happen as you were told. Now I'm going to show you the truth." The film's view is that the legends of King Arthur are based on a real man who did not live during the middle ages, as the legends state, but in the middle of the fifth century; also he wasn't an Englishman, but a Roman. The film tells us that around 450, when Rome was in decline, and England, which the Romans had conquered was being overrun by Saxons, the Romans kidnapped youngsters and forced them to serve in their army for fifteen years. One of these youngsters was Arthurius, known to us as Arthur. Arthur became quite adept at fighting and led a small group of about a half dozen men, including Lancelot and Tristan, who were devoted to him and whom he called his knights. As a final fight before releasing the band at the conclusion of their fifteen years, the Romans insisted that he fight against the Saxons. Arthur has no choice but to agree, and his band joins him. They encounter a group of English led by a man called Merlin, and his soldier Genevieve, and need to decide if they will work with Merlin's army. The film is filled with battle scenes. Viewers who enjoy such scenes will, like this film.</p></body></html>

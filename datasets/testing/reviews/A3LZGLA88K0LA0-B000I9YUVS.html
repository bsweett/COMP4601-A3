<meta name="summary" content="LOST IN THE PEA SOUP"></head><body><p>The original 1980s version directed by John Carpenter was never one of my favorite films of his; it was atmospheric and eerie, but it just wasn't all that scary to me.  So in viewing this remake, I tried to forget the original and look at it on its own merits.  Director Rupert Wainwright has captured the eerieness and has a few jolts here and there, and this new FOG is better than some of the other remakes of recent years (Planet of the Apes, e.g.).  Selma Blair comes out with the acting honors in a toned down version of the original Stevie Wayne; the rest of the cast including Superman Tom Welling and Lost's Maggie Grace do what's expected of their roles.  It entertained me and didn't lose my interest, so that's why the four stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A disappointing failure of a film!"></head><body><p>M. Night Shyamalan's movies appear to get progressively worse since THE SIXTH SENSE.  This movie begins out of nowhere and ends the same way. Explanations of what is happening or what has happened are almost non-existent and there is no credibility for anything that is happening.  Various issues and features brought into the story, such as a mood ring, separating families, the selective nature of "the happening" all turn out to be irrelevant . . they are never developed in the film.<br /><br />Shyamalan has obviously been trying to cash in on his one and only successful film and watching this one, and hoping for something remotely resembling THE SIXTH SENSE, is an exercise in frustration and disappointment.</p></body></html>

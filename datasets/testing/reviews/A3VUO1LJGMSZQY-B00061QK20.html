<meta name="summary" content="Budget Buy Blu bargain!"></head><body><p>In a nut shell: found at BB in their "$7.99" bin (after purchasing on line for same price). Audio: Original Chinese, and French, Spanish (all in 5.1 Dolby); English 5.1 DTS-HD. Video: 2.35:1. Subtitles: Eng/Fr/Spa. Extra features: fight scene close-up, "Hero defined" featurette, convo between Li and QT. Picture quality: on my 720p, very nice (especially "epic" scenes). Have heard some critique that it's not AS pristine in blu quality as it could be, but I found it sufficient. Am not a huge fan of this genre, but was told that if watched, do it in Chinese, as English dub is considered dreadful. Am therefore pleased with this purchase, especially given price!</p></body></html>

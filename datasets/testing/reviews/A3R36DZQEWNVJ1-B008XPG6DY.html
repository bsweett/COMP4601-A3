<meta name="summary" content="Clive Owen does solid work in Derailed decpite a miscast Jennifer Aniston"></head><body><p>Clive Owen (Sin City, Croupier) plays Charles Shine, a working man who has a loving wife, played by Melissa George (Tv's Alias, Amityville Horror remake) and they have a daughter who has diabetes and they have her hooked up to a dialysis machine because it would cost a lot of money to take her to a hospital. While on a train ride to work, Owen meets a beautiful nice mysterious woman named Lucinda Harris, played by a miscast Jennifer Aniston (Tv's Friends, Along Came Polly) and then they soon see each other again. They then go to a bar and then Owen wants to rent a hotel room so they do. They start then doing the deed but then a criminal comes in named La Rouge, played by Vincent Cassel (Brotherhood of the Wolf, The Reckoning) and beats up Owen and rapes Aniston. So, after this ordeal, they vow never to call the cops and that's when Cassel terroizes Owen for money and threatens his family in order to get what he wants. Clive Owen does some solid work here giving a great performance but he's tipped off scale by Jennifer Aniston who is very wrong for the role. Vincent Cassel is a very good actor and here he gives a scorching villainous performance. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito (Tv's Homicide: Life on the Street), RZA (Coffee and Cigarettes) and Xzibit (xXx: State of the Union).</p></body></html>

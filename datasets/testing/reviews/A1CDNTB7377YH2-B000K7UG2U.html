The DVD version is much better than the theater run because you can rewind and re-watch for things you missed.  This makes it worth owning.<br /><br />A group of soldiers are brainwashed to think that one of them was a war hero, when in fact nobody was in combat.  The "war hero" was being pushed by his ex-senator mother (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep in her first truly "evil" role) into politics and is on the verge of a possible nomination for the vice presidency.<br /><br />Some of the men start having recurring dreams that make them doubt what they thought was reality.  Denzel Washington, who was leading the soldiers back in the Gulf War, wants to get to the bottom of it.  Each time he gets close to some information he is told that he needs to continue taking his "medication" for the Gulf War syndrome.<br /><br />Things really get confusing when Denzel is being followed by government people and locates a computer chip in his back, that has capabilities that Denzel's friend who is a computer expert says could not possibly exist.<br /><br />The viewer can kind of figure out the Manchurian corporation is somehow behind everything and that it is all an elaborate plot to get the "war hero" into office.  The tension mounts however, where the viewer doesn't know how things will play out and if Denzel's character will come out of it alive.<br /><br />I</p></body></html>

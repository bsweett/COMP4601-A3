<meta name="summary" content="A Return to the Old School Spy Movie"></head><body><p>Yeah, Matt Damon is in this movie.  Yeah, it's got a happy ending.  Ya know what?  It doesn't matter.<p>"The Bourne Identity," based on a classic 1980 espionage novel, stars Damon as an amnesiac fished out of the Mediterranean Sea by a trawling vessel.  The ship's doctor removes two bullets from his back and a strange infrared device from his hip - a device that projects the account number at a Swiss bank.  After spending two weeks aboard the ship and recovering , Damon makes his way to Zurich, where he discovers that he is apparently Jason Bourne, and American who has a dozen passports and millions in foreign currency, along with a gun.  He's also discovering, slowly, that he has training in the art of espionage - fighting, shooting, and getting away.<p>With the James Bond franchise becoming more and more of a self-spoof and a serious lack of decent spy fare since the end of the Cold War, it's a pleasure to see the return of a great action genre.  "Bourne Identity" manages to weave a believable sense of paranoia while introducing enough gadgetry (although it's more of the MacGuyver kind than the Bond kind), nifty fights, and amazing escapes to satisfy.  It's not great, but it's decent enough, and Damon is almost a pleasure to watch in the action-hero role (and the subtle, sexy Franke Portente manages a wide character range in her relatively minor part).  <p>It's worth a trip to a matinee; if not a rental should you happen to miss it.<br /><br />Final Grade: B-</p></body></html>

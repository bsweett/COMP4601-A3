<meta name="summary" content="I enjoyed it"></head><body><p>As a hard core fan of the Alien series, and a guy with almost no interest in the predator series, I liked this movie.<br /><br />Poor Anderson (the director) had a lot to live up to.  Make a movie that satisfies fans who have been waiting upwards of ten years for a movie that successfully combines two popular franchises.  And don't forget that expectations were set astronomically high, so it was pretty much gauranteed that a lot of people would be dissapointed (Anybody remember "The Phantom Menace"?).<br /><br />I for one, enjoyed the movie.  I thought it had an average amount of action scenes that were well done.  The idea behind the pyramid and the artic setting was interesting, and the CGI and practical effects work were spectacular (Oh, and the use of red flares was a very nice touch).<br /><br />True, 90% of the charachters are alien fodder with almost no interesting charachteristics (except for Sebastian, Lex, and Weyland), but you all came to watch two intergalactic species fight each other, not to see well developed charachters.  A lot of people seem to hate the idea of humans and predators joining forces, but I for one liked it.<br /><br />I thought the action in the movie was quite enjoyable, especially during the last half hour, which features a lot of explosions, implosions, and green goop flying everywhere.<br /><br />Of course, the movie isint perfect.  At less then an hour and a half long, it's very short.  Blink an eye and it's done.  Not a good thing, because there's very little time to develop the charachters or the plot.<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed the movie.  I for one, look forward to Alien vs. Predator 2.</p></body></html>

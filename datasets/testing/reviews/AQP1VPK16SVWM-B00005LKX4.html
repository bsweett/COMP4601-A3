<meta name="summary" content="A Hammer horror film in all but name"></head><body><p>At the end Hammer films churned out a number of overwrought films with heavy handed direction and weak scripts. What has all that got to do with Hannibal? Read on and you'll find out. First, the title should have been a dead give away that this was not SOL or Red Dragon. <p>Hannibal has more in common with Alien than with Silence Of The Lambs. Ridley Scott has made a mainstream horror film. It's a shell game really. Scott has taken the genre trappings and put them under another walnut too swiftly for most folks to see. The baroque novel that Thomas Harris wrote really wasn't a very good sequel to his two popular bestsellers Red Dragon and SOTL. The screenplay does the best with what it's got. <p>The performances are over the top as can be expected in a gradiose horror spectacle. Gladiator, Scott's previous film, took Spartacus and merged it with a sword and sandal b movie creating a new sort of gory epic. With the added element of that film's satire (greatly on display in Hannibal as well), this uneasy alliance of different genres worked pretty well.<p>It's a pity that Jodie Foster didn't return to the role of Clarice Starling. Having Julianne Moore play the role brings a different element to the role. She has a world weariness and maturity that Foster might not have been able to bring to the table. That's not slightling Foster. It's a compliment to Moore in that she brought her own interpretation and emotional baggage to the role. Anthony Hopkins is, as befits his character, all over the place. He overplays the role a bit but it works given the film's context as a horror film. Ray Liotta plays a scummy FBI agent that is everything Starling is not -- a perfect foil who is more glory hound and politican than devoted government agent.<p>The screenplay improves Harris' feeble novel. The elements that were taken out are more in line with how the audience believed the characters would behave. In fact, it seems as if Harris' novel has completely different characters with the same names as in the previous work. That's not the case with the film. It's true to its character sources. <p>Is this film detestable? Frankly, there are moments that are pretty disgusting. But these moments also prevent Hannibal from becoming the anti-hero of the piece. He does unpleasant and disgusting things because he's evil. There's no cosmic sense of justice at work. That's where Moore's performance as Starling works well--she becomes the moral center of the film. Despite her dishonor, she continues to hold on to her sense of morality. It isn't dictated by politics but by what is right. <p>The film runs too long and the convulted plot doesn't hang together as well here as it did in SOTL (or Red Dragon). The later is due to the poor source material. I read Harris' book and, frankly, he was trying to destroy the sense of "romance" that had arisen around these two characters. While his intention was honorable, the plotting for Hannibal was sloppy and the character motivations poorly thought out. The screenwriters do a good job of cleaning up the book and making the story more coherent and presentable. Scott does keep Harris' tone though and that's probably what disgusts people more than anything else but it was meant to disgust at the same time as entertain.<p>You'll enjoy this film if you accept it not as a thriller but as a horror film. Silence Of The Lambs was a thriller in the Hitchcockian sense. Hannibal is clearly informed by all the European (particularly Italian) low budget horror films made during the 70's and 80's. Hannibal could have been directed by Mario Bava (if he was alive of course) with similar results. The film is powerful, unpleasant and atmospheric. It's also entertaining in a sick sort of horror film way. Which is precisely what Scott was aiming for. The cult of Lecter needed to be shaken up so that the audience can see him for what he is; a charming, arrogant sociopathic monster. Hannibal is a clear descendant of the type of films Hammer churned out in the late 60's and early 70's. Perhaps that's how it was intended. I'd suggest avoiding Hannibal if you're pretty easily sickened by gore.</p></body></html>

Always where you expect them the least..."></head><body><p>Well, this is certainly not your average movie for a Friday evening date. "The butterfly effect" is a dark, difficult and very shocking movie, full of sadness and suffering. DO NOT BELIEVE the regular press reviews! Watch it and make up your mind. You can love it (like me) or hate it, but believe me you will not be bored - and you will NOT forget it easily.<br /><br />I find it rather hard to believe that somebody dared to make not one but two sequels of this film! "Butterfly effect" is THE movie with conclusion. It goes full circle and ends the story without any ambiguity. This is probably one of the reasons that both sequels were so bad.<br /><br />This movie is mostly a one boy/one girl show. Ashton Kutcher may not be the greatest of actors, but in this film he is very good! And I really would like to see Amy Smart in more movies - why isn't she playing more? She is so beautiful and talented! Other actors are quite unknown, but still they perform well in supporting the two main protagonists.<br /><br />I will not reveal anything about the plot, except that at the end you will be surprised, shocked and HURT - and you will find the exact and clear answer to the question which is the title of this review...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent little flick worth seeing at least once."></head><body><p>Ok flick. "Wolf Creek" is nothing special but it does pass the test for viewing, "Wolf Creek" is basically a slasher /homicidal flick that is based on true events.<br /><br />Man this film is incredibly slow for the first hour almost to the point that I stopped watching the flick. Way too much emphasis on the Australian scenery and what not.<br /><br />Kristy, Ben, Liz are three friends out in the Wolf Creek area when their car doesn't stop, they meet a couple of disturbing , trashy , filthy locals in a bar. Eventually the trio becomes the focus of a deranged little killer Mick and his friends.<br /><br />Once the movie does get going (with roughly thirty minutes left) the action does as well. Pretty decent stunts, and some gore with a couple of intense scenes. The scene near the highway reminded me of "Mad Max" when one of the killer's buddies wants to run down one of the victims. Greg McLean does at least have an eye for creating some memorable shots in the movie<br /><br />Overall "Wolf Creek" is pretty average but it is ok for viewing. Again nothing new here except this is based on actual events.<br /><br />I will say that the acting for the movie when it calls for it ain't that bad. There are some memorable scenes  near the end too.<br /><br />Worth seeing at least once.</p></body></html>

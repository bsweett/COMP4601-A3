<meta name="summary" content="No."></head><body><p>Jennifer Aniston is a terrible film actress.  She may be okay for bit parts in half hour comedy television, but she cannot carry a major film.  She has no persona.  She's a one note, expressionless, actress.<br /><br />And Clive Owen is wasted in this lame script.  You will watch the film to the end, just to see how it turns out, and then be disappointed.<br /><br />I, regrettably, bought this film based on the recommendations in Amazon.  My advise to you: Don't even rent this film.</p></body></html>

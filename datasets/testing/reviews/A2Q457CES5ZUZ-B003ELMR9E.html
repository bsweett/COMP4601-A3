<meta name="summary" content="Pacino in Top Form"></head><body><p>From the time that Al Pacino became an international superstar with his gripping performance in "Dog Day Afternoon" he has held film audiences in rapt attention with his inner intensity.  He often will not even say a word; the tension looms as a coil ready to spring.  Pacino generates interest, speaking or silent.<p>In "Insomnia" Pacino plays a well known but highly troubled Los Angeles detective assigned with partner Marty Dawson to travel to a small Alaskan town to help solve a murder which has local police baffled.  When he arrives Pacino is overwhelmed when energetic rookie officer Hilary Swank, determined to be the best in her profession, idolizes him to the point of knowing his cases and even notable quotes, in the manner of a baseball fan knowing the statistics and famous games of a favorite player.<p>Alaska is known for its seemingly interminable alternating periods of sun and darkness.  Pacino arrives during the sun period.  As a result, he finds it impossible to sleep.  As the story develops we learn that it is more than the sun, however, bothering Pacino.  His own past and present career as an officer reside in indefinite turmoil.<p>Pacino is in Alaska to solve the murder of an attractive 17-year-old girl.  When suspicion shifts from her abrasive, physically abusive high school boyfriend to a local older pulp mystery writer, the story heats up.<p>When Pacino and police cohorts are seeking to corner the murder suspect in a field shrouded in fog, Pacino unleashes a shot and kills his partner.  He is happy to leave the impression that the retreating suspect killed his Los Angeles police sidekick, but his world is jolted when, during one of his many sleepless nights, he receives a call from the detective writer, who reveals that he saw Pacino fire the shot that killed his partner.<p>Robin Williams, who made his mark in rollicking comedy, turns in a superb effort as the troubled writer who believes that, by making a compact with Pacino, they can both emerge free of suspicion.  The wily but troubled Williams theorizes that all Pacino needs to do is direct suspicion back to the boyfriend, pretend to solve the case, and return to Los Angeles, leaving him unscathed with a patsy being convicted of the crime.  He explains that he did not really mean to kill the young woman anymore than Pacino meant to kill his partner.  Accordingly, they should both be free of any taint of guilt. <p>The picture and the blackmail offer from Williams becomes more complicated when it is revealed that Pacino was being investigated by the internal affairs department in Los Angeles and believed his own partner would be a crucial element in bringing him down.  So did he or did he not kill his partner deliberately?  Does Pacino ultimately know?<p>The imaginative script by Hilary Seitz keeps viewers guessing until its conclusion.  Swink, a recent Best Actress Oscar winner, does a superb job as the gung ho small town Alaska police officer who begins figuring things out on her own pertaining to both Pacino and Williams.</p></body></html>

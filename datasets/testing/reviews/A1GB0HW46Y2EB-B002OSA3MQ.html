<meta name="summary" content="One of the All Time Great Films"></head><body><p>This film will undoubtedly be ranked as among the great films of the 20th century.  It's all been said before so I won't get into writing a review of the film itself.  However, there is one point I wish to bring up.  I bought the Criterion DVD  which for picture and sound has all anyone could wish.  However, like all non-anamorphically processed DVDs containing a non-widescreen movie, it  has the aspect ratio of 1.33:1, which is, of course, the standard for NTSC television since 1941.  However, many people don't realize that the standard set in 1931 for motion pictures was 1.37:1 and remained so until 1953 when a wider aspect ratio was introduced, varying from 1.66:1 to 1.85:1, optional with the directors and/or producers.  As a result all DVDs containing movies from the 30s, 40s and early 50s have been processed at 1.33:1 to conform to the prevailing television standard.<br /><br />Now with HD television and Blu-ray discs, the 1.33:1 standard is no longer an issue.  All pre 1953 movies released on Blu-ray can be and one hopes will be presented in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  I was happy to see that Warner Bros. released the Blu-ray version of "The Wizard of Oz" using the 1.37:1 standard even though the packaging states it as 1.33:1.  The difference is small but it's definitely there.  Here's hoping it will be maintained by all providers of Blu-ray titles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of David Fincher's best films"></head><body><p>This ranks up there with Seven and Fight Club, but is totally unlike both of those films. Whether you believe the main theory of this film or not, you can't deny how this nearly three hour film just flys by. The directing, acting, and pacing is all first rate. This is the kind of film that makes me want to be a detective. Kudos Mr. Fincher. We are glad to have you back.</p></body></html>

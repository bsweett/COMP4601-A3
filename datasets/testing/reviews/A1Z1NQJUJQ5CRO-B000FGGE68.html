<meta name="summary" content="A Poor Man's Aeon Flux !"></head><body><p>I wanted SO much to like Ultraviolet,but it is plagued by poor editing and subplots that are either unfinished or that<br />simply go nowhere.It is all look but no substance.The movie starts with Ultra telling us"I was born into a world,you may not understand".Truer words were never spoken.<br />The story concerns a research organization that alters a virus that has been around for centuries.The intention is to create stronger and faster soldiers;instead they create a contagion.We are told by a voice over by Ultra that she contracted the disease when her husband was killed(blood splattered on her),which in turn killed her unborn infant.As a result she fled underground and formed a resistance.A few scenes later we get our first plot contradiction,as she enters the research facility under the guise of being a courier to pick up a package.She gets the suitcase containing the "weapon" but her cover is blown when the real courier shows up.As she fights her way out security identifies her as one who has been confined to the facility in the past for EXPERIMENTATION and whose pregnancy was PURPOSEFULLY terminated(!?).She was human at one time but is now a hemophage like the rest of the resistance.<br />The movie continues as she heads back to resistance headquarters and at one point stops to look inside the white case she carries.She discovers the "weapon" is a young boy.Her priorities,for some reason we're not privy to,change and she suddenly becomes a protective mother;totally opposite to the character we've so far seen.She spirits the boy away from the resistance leaders and turns to a fellow hemophage by the name of Garth for help.For some reason which again we are not privy to,Ultra needs a blood transfusion and Garth,who has pointy teeth,says it's lucky she didn't "convert" with her light exposure(?).After testing the boy he tells Ultra he doesn't have "vampiral anti-genetic blood"(??);in fact he is useless to them.So Garth is a ...vampire too?While there the boy writes some chemical symbols on a magazine and Garth files it away for future reference(as we shall see).At this point there seems to be some kind of feelings between Garth and Ultra but that sub plot is not furthered in any way.The boy apparently is dying and when Daxus,the head of the research facility,contacts Ultra to get the boy back she finally relents when Daxus reveals he is the father.She takes him to a mall to leave him there but she again cannot bring herself to go through with it but the boy runs away and is caught by her own resistance.She fights and succeeds in freeing him from their grasp.Daxus finally talks Ultra into bringing the boy directly to the research facility and she shows up;but unbeknownst to Daxus,as a hologram.Daxus reveals that the boy really contains an anti-human vuris.The hemophages are no longer a threat to him so he's created a new menace people will line up at his doors to get the antidote for.It doesn't take long for Daxus to realize Ultra is not real but by this time she is long gone with the boy.They end up in a playground where the boy in a short time finally dies.With a teary Ultra kneeling over him,she is killed by Daxus who has followed her via a tracking device in the boy.Next thing we see is Ultra waking up having been revived by Garth.We also now see for the first time that Ultra has vampire teeth!? Garth is also NOW suddenly convinced that the<br />writing the boy did on that mag cover he stashed away,is a cure for the hemophages!? Ultra is not moved as she thinks the boy is still alive.Of course the showdown has to happen between Daxus and Ultra and a battle royale it is.During it we learn that Daxus has hemophage blood also so the fight goes neck in neck until Ultra finally triumphs.She and the boy are united.The boy WAS alive because the hemophage cells in her tears helped to transform him also into a hemophage.<br />I have left alot out but I think you get the general idea.As the movie progresses the plot incongruities make things go from bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening.Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.<br />The resistance movement lives in a spiral tipped building.They own the first half while a chinese gang,Ultra battles,owns the top portion.And after the battle,how she gets from the rooftop to a street level area with the boy in hand is not explained.Things like this are thrown out at you continually.<br />Even the special effects have their lax moments.During a chase scene on a motorcycle Ultra is travelling first alongside an office building then straight up until she reaches the roof.While she is in midair her image gets shaky which effectively ruins the power of the moment and of the special effect itself.<br />I know nothing of the history or creation of this film but I am certain there was alot of footage that got cut out here and what an obvious hatchet job was done too.It is like a puzzle that not only got reassembled improperly but with pieces missing!Either studio pressure,budget constraints or both got this thing whittled down,but at the price of the integrity of the picture.What a disappointment to such a promising property.<br />For those interested the picture and sound quality are excellent here.The special features contained therein consist of the trailer,a 30 m "UV Protection-The Making of UltraViolet" short and optional commentary to the movie by star Milla Jovovich.<br />Give this one a definite pass.</p></body></html>

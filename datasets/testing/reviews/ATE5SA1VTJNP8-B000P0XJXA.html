<meta name="summary" content="Mamet Comes Through Yet Again"></head><body><p>David Mamet is one of the most interesting screen writers out there. The dialouge in his films are always somewhat mechanical, yet poetic. If you've seen the brilliant Spanish Prisoner, then you should have an idea of what I'm talking about. Spartan delivers that same layered, hand-crafted dialouge again.<br /><br />The story is interesting, as are the characters. The president's daughter is missing, and so Kilmer, who is a sort of Rouge government agent, who does as he is told, no more or no less, is hired along with a partner who has a knack for questioning everything. A very Mamet-like plot then unfolds with all of the conspiracies that you'd expect from a Mamet film.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film immensly. The acting, while not excellent, is appropriate, and as I said before, the script is to be savored by all fans of conspiracy/mystery thriller films.</p></body></html>

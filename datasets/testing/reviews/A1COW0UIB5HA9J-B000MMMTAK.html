But at a hotel room in New York City, he watches a TV show called Baywatch as Pamela Anderson catches his eye and decides to head all the way from New York to California as he still films his documentary so he can get with Pamela as he encounters Jews (which are hated his in country), gays, African Americans, hookers and other crazy stuff on a cross trip country filmmaking trip.<br /><br />Brilliant social satire dark comedy-mockumentary from the creative genius of British comedy maestro Sacha Baron Cohen (Creator of "The Da Ali G Show") is one of his finest movies with "Da Ali G Movie" and "Bruno" which all formed a trilogy. This movie pushes no limits between taste and creativity as it's quite controversial as sometimes being antisemetic but Cohen is a British Jewish person and he defended this movie as being a satire on American culture including racism. The film is the best of Cohen's big trilogy but it may offend people but in a good way even with an unbelivable nude fight scene that has to be seen to believed.<br /><br />This DVD contains only three extras which is a shame such as deleted scenes, Global PR Tour and music informercial.</p></body></html>

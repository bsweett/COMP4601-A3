<meta name="summary" content="Great comedy for the road"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies released in 2000.  Cameron Crowe amazingly reflects on his times as a writer while traveling with legendary bands(Led Zeppelin, Allman Brothers, The Eagles, etc.).  He takes certain events that occurred during each tour and gives it to the movie's band.  Every piece of that fits perfectly amongst one another to create one masterpiece movie.  It's great that Crowe can make some of those serious events and put some comedy in them. Therefore, he was well-deserving of his Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay.<br /> Patrick Fugit makes a triumphant debut as William Miller.  If he continues to do movies in this style, he'll go far with his acting career.  Why did Marcia Gay Harden win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress("Pollock") over Kate Hudson as "Penny Lane"?  Who knows.  Frances McDormand performs wonderfully outside her usual style as William Miller's overprotective mother.  This is Billy Crudup and Jason Lee at their best as the lead guitarist and lead singer of Stillwater.  Though Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin had minor roles as band aids, their acting shined.  This is one of Paquin's best roles since her Oscar winning role(at the age of 11) in "The Piano".<br /> "Almost Famous" could be a huge influence for those who dream of making the big-time in music, any genre.  This is also a good one for those who are looking for quality comedy.  There are many surprises so one will laugh unexpectedly in various parts.  Why wasn't it nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director for 2000?  Who knows.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If your a fan of movies go see this one."></head><body><p>I personally have never been a fan of rap or hip-hop. I come from The Who, AC/DC, Eric Clapton and Motorhead. However as big of a music fan as I am I am also just as big of a movie fan.<br />After seeing the the trailers I must admit I rolled my eye's, like i'm sure a lot of people did, and dissmised it. After learning that Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind)was producing the film and Curtis Hansen (LA Confidential) was directing I knew that the movie would be watchable. Finally I swollowed my prode and went to see the film.<br />  The movie is about a young aspiring rapper from Detriot named Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) struggling to cope with life and his unclear future. The movie opens with Jimmy becoming frozen onstage during a battle. By opening the movie that was I think that you care about Jimmy right from the get go. He moves back with his mother (Kim Basinger) in a trailer park. Jimmy struggles with his mother and other rappers.<br />Solid preformances by Britt Murphy as Jimmys girl and Mekhi Phifer as Jimmys friend. Still the movie belongs to Eminem.<br />  The movie and the charactors are well devloped and the plot is simple but plauseable (The Quiet Man wasn't a big story either). The acting is very good and surprising considering that Eminem has never acted in a movie before.<br />  The movie also deals with racisim on both sides of black and white and for that alone this movie is worth commending.<br />  The music suits the movie well and even though i'm not a fan of the music on a whole I found myself humming the title song later in the day.</p></body></html>

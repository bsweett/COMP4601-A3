<meta name="summary" content="Superb Film"></head><body><p>&quot;House of Sand And Fog&quot; is a very compelling movie released in 2003, starring Oscar winners Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley.  The plot is wonderfully adapted from the book version of the same name.  It brilliantly combines two lives that later meet: a woman who's life is tumbling downward after having been evicted from her house and an Iranian family who buys that house only as an investment.  The emotional impact is never held back for a moment, which continually builds as the struggles become more intense.  Later, it becomes more than a film about a woman trying to move back into her house.  Its unique chain of events keep audiences awaiting for what happens next.  The Oscar-nominated original score wonderfully accompanies the scenery.<p>Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo give wonderful Oscar nominated performances (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress).  Their characters' passions and hardtimes are expressed beautifully.  Kingsley proves that he's continually evolved as an actor through his entire career.  Jennifer Connelly gives a heartpounding performance, especially through her character's life threatening struggles.  All other actors also offer captivating performance.<p>&quot;House of Sand And Fog&quot; is a powerful film that will continue to attract audiences.  This offers an unforgettable viewing experience for everyone.</p></body></html>

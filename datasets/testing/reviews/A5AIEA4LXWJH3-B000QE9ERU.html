<meta name="summary" content="Video Not Great, Good Audio"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video quality was not the greatest, not the worst.  It was better than First Blood and Total Recall, but not really good for a Blu-Ray.  I give it 6 or 7 out of a 10.0 scale.  The audio was not Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio.  You can select "6.1 DTS-ES Discrete Audio" (which is what I selected), or "5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX".  Audio was pretty good (surround sound with sub-woofer bass).</p></body></html>

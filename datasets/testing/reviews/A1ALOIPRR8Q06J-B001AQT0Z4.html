<meta name="summary" content="A Freak Occurrence"></head><body><p>If somebody pointed a gun at me and said,"You gotta have an opinion -about what the best movie of the 90s is" I'd tell them to point that gun away from my head before it accidently goes off. And then for lack of a better answer to this impossible question, I would answer PULP FICTION. In anycase, anyone crazy enough to point a gun at somebody while asking their opinion about what the best movie of the 90s is might not like other answers I might come up with as much.<br /><br />I think it is the funniest movie I've seen that actually doesn't go in the comedy section at the video store. There are no flaws in it. It's perfect. Quentin Tarantino cannot ever top it and will probably never even come close. When he dies they will refer to him first and foremost as the director of PULP FICTION. His place in history as one of the great directors of cinema is secured with this film.</p></body></html>

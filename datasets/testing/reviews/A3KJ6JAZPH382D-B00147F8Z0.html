<meta name="summary" content="Please, just kill them now."></head><body><p>Now here was a sequel that no-one was waiting for. After the horrendous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMZK">AVP - Alien Vs. Predator</a>, someone, somewhere, decided there needed to be a follow-up. And yes, I decided to rent it. And yes, I kind of wish I hadn't.<br /><br />But just to note, AvP-R is a better movie that its originator, if only because there's no convuluted maze for the Aliens, Predators and Humans to go running around in. This time, a small town in BFE, Colorado gets infested when a Predator Drone filled with nasty little critters inexplicably gets sent back to Earth. The Predator that had an Alien baby inside at the end of AvP-1 also escapes and becomes a pretty cool Pralien. A fresh predator from the mothership comes to Earth to wipe out the new brood (and kill a few humans along the way). But soon the town is populated with a whole bunch of central casting hopefuls, like the teenaged bully, the good girl, the troubled kid with a good heart, the worried cop, kooky homelss guy, a man who had to look in the dark corner, etc. Before you can say "I Know What You Did Last Space Camp," the small Colorado town is crawling with Aliens and dead bodies and AvP-R becomes an Intergalactic Slasher Flick.<br /><br />This works for about 3/4's of the movie, with some memorable scenes thrown in for good mesaure. The Maternity Ward act is pure genius and won't be soon forgotten, however, the ending is pure tack-on. It takes what might have been a decent film and drops it to a special FX bit of hack-work. Only the twist adds any satisfaction, just barely. Fans only.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No Mercy!"></head><body><p>This film may be reviewed from different standpoints and accordingly judged.<br />I'll try to express my feelings regarding these conflicting different aspects.<br /><br />First I'll give a brief resume of the story.<br />Creasy is an ex-CIA agent spent, alcoholic, depressed and haunted by his past.<br />He goes to Mexico to pay a visit to Rayburn his retired mate, trying to find some ease to his predicament.<br />Rayburn's brilliant idea is to attain an "easy job" for his pal as a child's bodyguard.<br />Creasy close the deal with child's father stating clearly he is an alcoholic and not at his best.<br />His prot&eacute;g&eacute;e is delighted with him, but Creasy tries to keep a "business relationship" with her. No way, Pita is persistent and charming. Creasy's defenses melt and a warm relationship ensues.<br />Creasy quits drinking.<br />Pita conquers a swimming prize.<br />A Kidnappers Team ends this happy association: Pita is abducted and Creasy left bleeding and loaded with lead.<br />Without recovering from his wounds Creasy starts a wild revenge chase, picking one suspect after other with the help of a journalist.<br />Until the bitter end, a blood full cavalcade ensues.<br /><br />When judged as an action film: it is a great movie.<br />Starts a little morosely, but setting very clearly the scenery. After Pita's kidnapping action explodes ceaselessly. Nicely filmed, each photogram is framed with great care.<br /><br />When judged appreciating playacting: it is outstanding.<br />Denzel Washington gives, once more, a very impressive impersonation. He is one of my all times favorite actor. He fleshes with equal success historical characters as Malcolm X ("Malcolm X" 1992) or Steve Biko ("Cry Freedom" 1987), investigators as Grantham ("The Pelican Brief" 1993) or Hobbes ("Fallen" 1998) as in the present role as Creasy.<br />There are not enough words to describe Dakota Fanning's performance: enticing, self-possessed, very expressive and realistic. 10 point to the young lady!<br />Christopher Walken as Rayburn, Radha Mitchell as the child's mother and Giancarlo Giannini as Manzano give the audience very good acting pieces.<br />Special mention must be done for Rachel Ticotin as journalist Mariana, sober but full of stamina acting. She deserves to receive more important personages to flesh up. She is a very fine actress, still underestimated by producers and directors.<br /><br />When judged taking into account ethical values: here is where issue is in doubt.<br />Is Creasy entitled to ruthlessly torture, mutilate and kill? Even if the "Bad Guys" are really bad and wicked as in this film, is it ok to apply such barbaric measures?<br />IMO: no. He or anyone else is not entitled to do such things. There are always other means to obtain justice and give retribution to evil-doers.<br /><br />I consider this an intelligent film that may be enjoyed by action movies lovers. Notwithstanding young audiences should be discouraged.<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Walking On Magnetic & Rotating Rocks, or Only On Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>Basically, Brandon Fraser's getting kicked out of his college lab (SNL's Seth Meyers makes a great appearance), Brandon's nephew spends vacation with him before moving to Ottawa (I prefer Toronto), the two go volcano hunting in Iceland (none of my uncles would have ever spent the money to take me to Iceland)... Ahhh who cares, it's all just an excuse to for some 3D action! But let me warn you, DO NOT GET THIS IN STANDARD DEFINITION! Why?<br /><br />Because this movie looks stunningly beautiful in awesome in Blu-Ray, and it just adds so much to the experience. In SD, it's a sub-par experience, because the movie was made for HD, and of course 3D, but with those paper red/blue 3D glasses, I only noticed a substantial 3D effect during the credits. During the movie, the action just moves too fast, and your color is all distorted. So unless you have a really good pair of glasses, you might want to skip that. But you'll still have the picture and the action. It's a throwback to those Saturday matinee serials where things jump out, scare you, and surprise you. Things blow up, explode, collapse, and the action and adventure is certainly entertaining. Good family fun, although the little ones may find some of it a bit too intense.<br /><br />Overall, don't even consider the SD version as you'll only come out disappointed. HD on the other hand makes all the difference, and it makes the movie that much better. Sure the plot is nothing to write home about, but the family and I had a very fun time with this popcorn flick. And I'm very open to a sequel, if it's filmed in the same manner. An Atlantis plot is especially intriguing.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Road to Perdition  (2002)"></head><body><p>Director:  Sam Mendes<br />Cast:  Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Graig.<br />Running Time:  117 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence and language.<p>Director Sam Mendes has the extraordinary talent of weaving stories on film that can be used on many different levels.  His first main feature, &quot;American Beauty&quot; was an exhilerating tale that on one level was a satire of surban life, while also a dark, melancholic depection of the meaning of life and how beautiful each small essence of it can be.  &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, his next feature, has a simlar tone to it and is a film that is layered similar to an onion.<p>Tom Hanks is good (yes, only good--his efforts in films such as &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Castaway&quot;, and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; were slightly better) as a gangster who works for one of the most powerful (and crooked) men in the city (played by Paul Newman in a limited role, unfortunately).  When his son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses an accidental murder of one of his father's colleagues, the duo must leave town in order to survive the aftermath of the ordeal.  Jude Law gives a great performance as the eerie photographer who is hired to not only track down the father and son, but kill them because of the information they are not supposed to know.<p>&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a powerful tale that captures the essence of the extraordinary possibilites presented in a father-son bond.  It is a film that shows the corruptness of the business world at the time (the film was depicted around the time of the depression), but ultimately unfolds as a journey about vengeance, redemption, and love.  Although not as superb as some critics may have claimed, it is still a motion picture that will satisfy fans of Hanks and Mendes, although those who are anticipating a powerhouse role from the aging Newman will be disappointed--he is not as integral part of the film as you would think.  The finale is exceptional.</p></body></html>

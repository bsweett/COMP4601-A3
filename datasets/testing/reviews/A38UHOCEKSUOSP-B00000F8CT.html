<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] Time to revisit this sci-fi horror classic"></head><body><p>I watched AVPR in the theatre recently, and actually enjoyed it (but for nothing more than great creature action and effects).  Unlike the first AVP, it returned (especially with the aliens) to a bit more of a darker, horror film that the original Alien films had (but still overun by action).  Not that AVPR is even comparable, but it put me in the mood to watch the first Alien move again...wow.  It seperates the men from the boys.  Alien is the men.  This is a film in the series that is made with a bit of everything in mind - horror, mystery, acting, characters, story, and exceptional originality and creativity.  In addition, also a great director (Ridley Scott) and score composer (Jerry Goldsmith).  The result is a great movie that has gone down as one of the greatest horror films ever.<br /><br />The movie certainly takes its sweet time to get things rolling, but at the same time creates a great sense of mystery and an atmosphere of fright.  We also get to know the crew, which is a family in their own way.  Things feel like they happen in real time, and the acting feels less of reading from a script and more of improv - resulting in an experience that pits the viewer in the scene that feels less like a movie and more like reality.  Perhaps the most memorable moment from the film, and in cinematic history, is the chest-bursting sequence at the dinner table.  Though the sequals and recent AVP movies have their gory bursting scenes as well, the original is still the most frightening.<br /><br />Unlike Aliens (which is a tremendous sequal) and the AVP movies, we see see very little of the Alien in this film, but that keeps its mystery and the horror up on the scale.  The effects are actually quite fine, and the Alien looks great.  Slowly but surely, like any horror flick, the crew dies one by one, until our main character - Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is faced off against the alien beast.  Her character begins as an average person of the crew, she's not even the captain but her role shines brilliantly as the movie progresses, finally resulting in one of the strongest female roles known in cinematic history (and the Aliens sequal aided that as well).<br /><br />They just don't make them like they used to.  While the newer Alien and Predator films may "look" great, the original Alien is an all around great film.  It takes more than just action and effects to pull it off, and Alien provides what it needs to fullfill this.  Though this is more of a horror film than action - the Aliens sequal becomes more of an actioner and less horror.  If you aren't even a fan of Alien movies, still try the first Alien movie just for a scary good time.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Horror - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

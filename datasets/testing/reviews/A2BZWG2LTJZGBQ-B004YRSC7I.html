You see, that would be a propos for this film, which takes precisely that approach to tell the story.  It moves from end to beginning, with each scene that the audience sees being the scene which took place before the previous scene.<p>Well, kind of.  There is also another similar plot line which runs in true time and is mostly the main character, Leonard (Guy Pearce) talking to someone on the phone about a strange mental condition.  No worries about telling the two plot lines apart, because this alternate plot line is shot completely in black and white, while the plot line that runs in reverse is done in color.  The movie alternates black and white scenes with color scenes, which leaves us completely confused for a while.<p>Not really such a bad thing for this movie, because that's exactly what Leonard feels.  He was a detective living a normal life, when his wife was brutally raped and murdered.  He walked in on the attack and was slammed into a wall.  He developed a strange condition from this injury.  He can form no new memories.  Anything that happened to him before the attack is crystal clear.  Since then, any encounter he has fades from memory within seconds.<p>To combat this, he uses his body as a kind of billboard, tatooing various facts about the killer all over himself, so he won't forget them as he hunts down the killer of his wife.  He also keeps pictures of everyone he meets and writes notes on the backs to keep straight whether they can be trusted.  Some of the people he meets may not be his true friends, but we don't know that, we are along for the ride.<p>The two main characters Leonard meets in the movie are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss).  Both characters are not who they seem at first, and one wonders if either can truly be trusted.  Kudos must go out to Pearce, who gives an excellent performance as the brain damaged Leonard.  You can sense his acceptance of the reality of his life, yet see the despair just underneath the surface.  Magnificent performance.<p>Camera work is another plus here.  A couple of neat tricks for us.  The opening scene is of someone being shot with a pistol.  The scene goes completely in reverse, with the bullet going back into the gun and the blood crawling  up the wall.  This sets the scene for the type of storytelling we will be seeing.  Also, I mentioned the two separate storylines.  Watch toward the very end for these to come together.  It will take a careful eye to spot the moment when they do.<p>The main accomplishment for Christopher Nolan is the ability to structure the film in this way and still leave us a surprise at the end.  Or beginning.  Whatever.  By the time the credits roll, we learn that everything that has gone before may not be completely accurate.  Is that the message?  That memory itself is unreliable?  Perhaps.<p>Finally, the DVD itself.  Wonderful.  The image is crisp and clear.  The DTS sound is awesome  The discs are loaded with extras although I admit they are a pain to access, particularly disc 2.  You may have to go to a website to fully explain how to access everything.  My favorite feature is the one which lets you watch the whole movie in real time  The black and white scenes all actually happen before the color scenes in real time.  This is evident when you utilize this feature.<p>In short, this is a must see.  I promise, you will not see anything like this for a long time.  The script, acting, and execution are near flawless.  Go grab a copy of this and get ready to watch it at least twice!</p></body></html>

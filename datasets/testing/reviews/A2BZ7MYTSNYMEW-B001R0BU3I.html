<meta name="summary" content="Whose side is he really on?"></head><body><p>Samir Horn (Cheadle) is a Sudan born Muslim (raised and trained in the US) who appears to have terrorist ties, or at least in the beginning to be some kind of dealer in explosives. Following his arrest and escape, we aren't really sure whose side Horn is on. How he struggles with his religious beliefs and his alliance to his country becomes central to the story. What I came to appreciate about this movie was portray of Horn as he struggled with his moral and religious convictions, and it is the dichotomy between these issues made for an interesting movie.<br /><br />I feel that Cheadle did a wonderful job with this role and anyone could benefit from watching this movie.</p></body></html>

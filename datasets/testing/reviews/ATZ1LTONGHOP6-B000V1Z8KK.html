<meta name="summary" content="Worth watching for the dubious message"></head><body><p>Three years after retiring from the army, sniper, Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), is called back into action by army hero, Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), to help avert the assassination of the U.S. president. However, when an assassination attempt is made, Swagger is double-crossed and ends up on the run for a crime he didn't commit.<br /><br />In many ways, "Shooter" reminds me a lot of "Hero". Not with respect to plot, but because both are films that I didn't particularly like, but, nevertheless, consider worth watching for the unusual and rather dubious messages at their cores. The message of "Shooter" seems to be that it's OK to shoot politicians whose political beliefs diverge from your own (either that or "the end justifies the means", one or the other). Considering the fact that this film is a Hollywood film, made in 2007, I was amazed that such a message was allowed, since it seems that, now days, film makers and production companies are more aware than ever of the dangers of including violence-encouraging messages in their films. For that reason, this film fascinated me, and I am glad I saw it.<br /><br />As a piece of cinema, however, "Shooter" is very lacking. It's not a terrible movie, I did enjoy the action sequences, but in between the action sequences, I found that my attention drifted. Most of the characters in the film are poorly written, in particular, the scenery-chewing villains, who are portrayed as having no redeeming features at all, and the film's heroine, played by Kate Mara, whose only purpose in the film seemed to be to follow instructions given by Swagger. It didn't help matters that Kate Mara is a terrible actress (I have never seen her in anything before this film, so perhaps it was just that she didn't have decent material to work with, but her performance in this film was so bad that, in the future, I will be avoiding her films), and that both Glover and Wahlberg mumble a significant proportion of their lines (this was particularly annoying in the case of Glover - I know he can speak properly, as he does in other films, and yet in this film, it sounded as though he had his jaw wired). The only actor who really stood out for me was Rhona Mitra, whom I was already a fan of, as an FBI agent, but her role is small and her character vanishes about 2/3 of the way through the film.</p></body></html>

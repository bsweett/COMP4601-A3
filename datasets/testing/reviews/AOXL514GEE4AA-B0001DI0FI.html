<meta name="summary" content=""...and though we be on the far side of the world, this ship is our home. This ship is England." Blu-ray review."></head><body><p>Based on author Patrick O'Brian's series of books, set during the Napoleonic Wars. It tells of the story of the H.M.S. Surprise and it's Captain, "Lucky" Jack Aubrey. The movie is an excellent adventure on the high seas but could have been epic. The movie picks up in the middle of the ocean with a preface of the ship's orders. From there they're suddenly attacked by a superior enemy. When the ship and crew are badly injured, Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he pursues a dangerous chase across oceans, to capture his enemy.  The movie's acting and historical accuracy are it's strongest points. Crowe and Bettany are a joy to watch play off each other. The action and cinematography are amazing as well. It could easily get 5 stars but it just feels like there was more story to tell. This movie belongs in any collector's library.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing picture and fantastic audio make this a blu-ray winner. The movie is shot mostly in dark and fog so it is tough to say this is a DEMO DISC, but those who know will see how beautiful it is. The special features from the collector's edition are nowhere to be found and is the only drawback. FINAL VERDICT: Keep the collector's edition you bought but DEFINITELY UPGRADE!</p></body></html>

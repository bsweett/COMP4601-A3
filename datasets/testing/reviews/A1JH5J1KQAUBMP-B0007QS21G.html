<meta name="summary" content="Climaxes too soon"></head><body><p>Global warming and the resultant melting of the polar icecaps results in a sudden catastrophic rearranging of the global climate, leaving mankind to scramble for cover.  A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) treks to a frozen New York to find his lost son (Jake Guyllenhall).  This is big, dumb summer fun that is more about special effects than anything else, and those special effects are impressive indeed.  The twisters that decimate LA and the massive storm surge that inundates New York are the highlights of the film.  But therein lies the problem, because those scenes occur about halfway through the movie.  The story must rely more on the characters after that, but the characters just aren't interesting enough to sustain the film.  The perils that they face become much smaller in scale as well.  Who cares about wolf attacks, blood poisoning, and frostbite after we've seen the destruction of two major cities?  I didn't.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="4 and a half stars for one memorable movie..."></head><body><p>Walk The Line shows the legendary singer, Johnny Cash, during his impressive career. This movie will keep you entertained from start to finish and will only make you want to see it again and again, it's that good. With stars like Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon portraying Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter, this movie is filled with powerhouse performances.<br /><br />Walk The Line is unique and entertaining because it has all the singers actually sing their own songs instead of editing Cash's own voice into the movie. Reese Witherspoon took singing lessons and really shines in some music scenes as she sings for audiences in the movies. Pheonix shows he can sing too and gets the crowds going so well you can't help but tap your foot along with the music.<br /><br />The acting is great also, as every character adds their bit into the movie to make you feel as if you were witnessing Cash's life when he was still a young man. Some great scenes have him starting to sing for a record company and sing about his problems with the air force and his lifestyles.<br /><br />The movie starts off with Cash as a young man back in Arkansas who is noticed for his unique voice and how he sang about different topics that normally would create controversy and disbelief with people. His life takes a turn for stardom as he takes a tour around the country and meets up with June Carter, who he later starts a relationshp with.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon was absolutely wonderful as a young woman who was great to every fan who talked to her and went out of her way to start a conversation with anyone who asked for an autograph from her. She and Cash had a rocky relationship as they both fall for each other, become disgusted with each other as Cash's drug problem gets out of control, and eventually agree to marry one another in a great scene where Cash proposes on stage in a show in Canada.<br /><br />It's great seeing how Cash became famous for his singing, and we also see greats he is travelling with such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley. I also found the scenes with Cash dressing up all in black and his performance inside the prison the best scene of them all, with Cash taking his hat off to the inmates who have to drink horrid, brown looking water.<br /><br />This is one movie you need to see to understand how great it really is. Phoenix and Witherspoon are fantastic, the singing is wonderful, and the entertainment is off the charts.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />10 deleted scenes<br /><br />commentary by James Mangold, the co writer and director of the movie<br /><br />Plus More!</p></body></html>

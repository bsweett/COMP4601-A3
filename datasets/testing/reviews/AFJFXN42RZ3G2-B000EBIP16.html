Readers who love good storytelling may be attracted to watch this version of C.S. Lewis' tale of four children who run inside a mysterious wardrobe into a land that remains winter all year round as a result of an evil spell left by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).  The children later become the savior and leaders to the living creatures of the land called Narnia.  The children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) help to restore this enchanting land to its natural splendor from the cold and evil land it has been left to be.<br /><br />The film may echo Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.  However, NARNIA has the Disney touch.  The special effects as shown with the animals and human-animal creatures is quite amazing to see: The beavers, Mr. Tumnus, the faun, (James McAvoy) is a delight, the fox (voice of Rupert Everett), and Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson).  Disney's production brings Lewis' fantasy tale alive with enchantment and heroism.  In addition, the cinematography and the soundtrack are quite dramatic through out the film, especially with aerial shots of the mountainous terrain, the particular lighting that provides a religious backdrop, and the concluding cliche battle scene.<br /><br />What is interesting about reading and watching the cartoon version of THE LION, WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE as a child, the religious and historical references did not occur to me.  I merely read the book for the simple pleasure and the fantasy.  After viewing the film, it follows the same premise as the book with the exception to additional scenes that were made specifically for the film.<br /><br />NARNIA contains historical and religious references.  The opening London bombing scene applies a historical backdrop to the film, and the period in which C.S. Lewis wrote the book.  The theme of good versus evil, and in this case, the German Nazis bombing Britain.  In terms of religion, Aslan represents the God-like creature of the film that Lewis had intended in the original text of his book.<br /><br />Overall, NARNIA is a film that the entire family will enjoy.  The film's PG rating shows minimal violence, but scenes with the pack of wolves may scare some audience members and the scene with Aslan on the stone table may be disturbing.  Otherwise, if you like to see a imagination in movies, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA is the fantasy film to see.</p></body></html>

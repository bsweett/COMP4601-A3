<meta name="summary" content="Another 'Oh, well...' movie"></head><body><p>FAILURE TO LAUNCH certainly is.  The formula of placing eye candy stars in roles that require little more than one walk through rehearsal before filming seems to be a trend to satisfy the public, who unfortunately keep supporting these 20-minute sitcom ideas stretched beyond the limits of elasticity into a movie length features.<br /><br />The concept is that of a fixer called in to change a characters behavior only to have the 'fix' discovered and backfire. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) is the middle-aged live-at-home-mooching-off-the-parents (a really sad comment on a male type too popular in the media) whose parents (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, trying desperately to find out why they signed up for this film) want him to move out and on.  They hire professional motivator Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker in a re-run of her Sex and the City mold) to affect this change only to have Tripp discover the plot and make some changes of his own  causing......fill in the blanks.<br /><br />While the stars of the film are good, solid actors who do their best with the flimsy script to make it interesting, the main reason to watch this film is for the eye candy which, in addition to Parker and McConaughey, includes the gifted Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.<br /><br />On a hot summer night without air-conditioning this bit of fluff requires no thought and does have some moments of tongue in cheek truths that make it enjoyable in the hands of this cast.  Otherwise, the film falls into the 'must miss' category. Grady Harp, June 06</p></body></html>

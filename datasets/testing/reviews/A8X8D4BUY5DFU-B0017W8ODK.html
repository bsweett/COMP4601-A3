<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful love tragedy"></head><body><p>Repentance for the sinner. A young girl infatuated with her sister's lover commits a lie due to jealousy and mis perception, causing irreparable harm to both her sister and her sister's lover whose lives are traced in an beautiful, although convoluted narrative. As a more mature person she tries to right the wrong. Well photographed, moving film. To me, value is about 4.5 stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Burton Film"></head><body><p>Many people are really going to dislike this movie.  Many of them before they ever see the movie.  "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is such a beloved classic and many people never wanted to see the movie re-made.  But theres something that you have to take into account.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  Those two have collaborated four times and the three previous would spectacular, so you would have to believe that this movie would be great.  And staying true to their form, the movie is great.<br /><br />The story is the same as the previous film.  The owner of the greatest chocolate factory in the world, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), decides to let five children and a guardian of each to take a tour of his factory that has been closed to the public and to everyone for years.  They can take the tour if they find one of five golden tickets inside of the Wonka Bars.  Also one lucky kid will win a special prize.  So obviously, people go nuts trying to find these golden tickets by buying just about every Wonka Bar in sight.  Four of the golden tickets are found by fairly wealthy, spoiled kids and then the last one is found by sweet, very poor Charlie Buckett.  The kids are given a tour of the chocolate factory by Willy Wonka himself.  While in the factory, kids that are greedy, fat, cocky and too smart start disappearing out of the factory due to their behavior.  Kind of like what happens in Se7en.  The last kid left with Willy Wonka is Charlie and he wins the grand prize, The Chocolate Factory.  Did I really need to write all of that?<br /><br />First thing that people will judge is Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka compared to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka.  The thing that you will have to understand is that they are portraying two different Willy Wonka's.  Wilder's was sweet, charming and caring of the children.  Depp's is very cocky, paranoid and socially inept.  So to judge one character to another is like comparing apples and oranges.  My opinion is that Johnny Depp does a fantastic job with the character.  I like the darker Willy Wonka that he plays and honestly, who could play this character better than Johnny Depp?  Also who could direct this film better than Tim Burton.  One of the songs from the original has a line that says "in a world of pure imagination."  Is there any director with a greater imagination than Burton?  The colors, the odd shapes, the acting, along with Danny Elfman's creepy score all screams Tim Burton's classic film style.  The rest of the cast does a good job, but this movie is the Willy Wonka Show.<br /><br />So would I recommend this movie?  Definitely!  Is it better than the original?  I liked this movies darker setting, but it just matters on what your movie taste is.  So I would say that if you don't like Tim Burton movies, then don't see this movie.  If you like Tim Burton's style, then this is the film for you.</p></body></html>

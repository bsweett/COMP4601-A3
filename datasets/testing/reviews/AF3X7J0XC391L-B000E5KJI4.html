<meta name="summary" content="Very disappointing and without direction"></head><body><p>As a fan of Homer and Virgil I have to say this was one of the most disappointing movies seen in some time.  After the early scene of the "thousand ships" which was incredible, the plot slid quickly downhill.  Mr. Pitt did a good job with the character of Achilles and others were acceptable in their roles but so much of the story had been changed that it not only made an Odyssey sequel problematic but robbed the story of the wonderful reconciliation stories that followed.  The characters become one-dimensional and unbelievable from a script that took far too many liberties in attempts to "improve" a story that has stood the test of millenia.  Sad that the director/writers could not have left well enough alone and just told the story as it was meant to be told without the improvements of individuals noticably less talented than Virgil or Homer.  It gains two stars for the stunning photography and visual effects but loses other stars for its tedious and directionless plot.</p></body></html>

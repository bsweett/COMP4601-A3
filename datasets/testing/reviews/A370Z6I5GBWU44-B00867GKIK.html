I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already said, but I must put in one caveat - this movie is not for very young children. There is death in here (not just Ellie's own) and young kids might ask their parents if old people really are kicked out of their houses - Mommy and Daddy should expect to answer this question, as it is a sticky one for a kids' movie. For older kids and adults though it is an awesome movie.</p></body></html>

And, to top it all off, this occurs during the emotionally-charged time of Christmas?<br /><br />Amanda of Los Angeles punches her boyfriend in the nose for cheating on her, and breaks up with him. Meanwhile, in London, Iris is struggling with her affections for a co-worker. He has been toying with her for some three years. He acts as though he is interested in her one moment, but then has no qualms about openly seeing another woman. At one point, he is engaged to a woman--right in front of Iris. However often this happens, Iris just can't forget him. She loves him and wishes that he would unambiguously show love for her.<br /><br />The two hurt, confused women meet each other in the internet, and agree to live in each other's homes for two weeks in order to sort things out. Amanda goes to London, struggling in the snow of Christmastime. Iris goes to sunny California.<br /><br />Iris meets a man who diagnoses the situation facing Iris. He points out that it is natural to see a positive response from the other person as love and then to forget or deny the evidences of lack of love from that person. He himself catches his girlfriend with another man, and then faces her pleadings to forgive him and take her back. Will he? Or will something develop between himself and Iris?<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in London, Amanda runs into a man who pushes all her buttons. He seems so charming. But she is shocked to learn that he has two daughters. He then sheds his secretive self and notes that he is a widower and mother/father. What will happen then? How will they deal with the geographic distance separating them?</p></body></html>

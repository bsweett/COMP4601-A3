<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Hilarious Re-Awakening of the Spirit of Christmas"></head><body><p>Buddy is a human, accidentally taken from an orphanage as a baby, ending up with Santa's elves, and getting raised by them. He grows up much taller than they are. Buddy finds out that his father works in the Empire State Building, and sets out to find him.<br /><br />Buddy has no clue as to what city life is like, and there is one funny scene after another. Buddy hops on the lines painted on the street. He goes into revolving doors, and "rides" them for a long time. He makes goofy motions as he attempts to straddle the steps of an escalator. He jumps from mattress to mattress in a department store. He eats pigeon droppings from off the fences (ugh!). He takes a flyer from one man and then passes it on to another man who is passing out flyers--back and forth.<br /><br />Knowing the real Santa, Buddy exposes the Santa at Gimbel's store as a fraud. There is quite a row there, right in front of the children! But then Buddy stays at the store overnight and decorates it in a fashion never seen before.<br /><br />Over time, Buddy's father warms up to him. It isn't easy. Buddy acts like a huge overgrown child, and is a constant source of irritation in the family and at his father's workplace. Buddy's eating habits are bizarre, to say the least. Everything must have candy!<br /><br />In time, Buddy becomes close to his half-brother, a boy named Michael. After school, Buddy meets him, and they walk home together. Suddenly, some boys pelt both of them with snowballs. No problem. Buddy picks up a bunch of snowballs and hurls them at the adversaries in machine-gun fashion, hitting all of them squarely. They all scatter.<br /><br />Santa's Sleigh crashes in Central Park in New York. Only Buddy can repair it, and then only the spirit of Christmas can make it fly again. (The spirit of Christmas involves such things as singing Christmas songs, and believing in Santa. It is measured by a "Clausometer" gauge in Santa's sleigh). Michael makes off with Santa's list. People are curious what is written in it. The television reporter is embarrassed when Michael reads what Santa was asked to give her. Then people start to sing, the Christmas spirit re-awakens, and the magic begins again.</p></body></html>

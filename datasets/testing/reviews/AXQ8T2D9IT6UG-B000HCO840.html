The reason is simple: pretty much all the reviews I read said it was awful. I should have known better than to pay too much attention to them!<br /><br />I ended up going to watch "X-Men - The Last Stand" this morning, because my sister wanted to see it. I had a very welcomed surprise. This movie is probably the best in the series, at least so far. Of course, you shouldn't expect too much: this is a movie designed merely for entertainment purposes, and it is quite far from being a classic or anything similar to that. That having been said, it engages the audience easily, and it entertains.<br /><br />This movie doesn't pretend to be more than what it is: a blockbuster with lots of action and not too much character development. However, that is all right in my book, at least in some of the films I watch. Yes, "X-Men - The Last Stand" could have been better, but it is nonetheless a film you will probably like, specially if you are already a fan of the series.<br /><br />The inspiration for the plot is taken from the "X-men" comics, even though the story has been substantially modified. In a nutshell, a cure to treat mutations has been found, and mutants react differently to that discovery. The Brotherhood, a group of mutants whose leader is Magneto (Ian McKellen), plans to destroy the cure. The X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), think that every mutant should be able to choose without pressures whether to remain one or not. In Prof. Charles Xavier's words "Since the dawn of existence, there have always been moments when the course of history shifted. Such a turning point is upon us now" (...) "I do not know if victory is possible. I only know that great sacrifice will be required. And because the fate of many will depend on a few, we must make the last stand".<br /><br />There is also a secondary plot: Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), an X-Men that died in the second film of the series in order to save her teammates, is reborn, but as someone different, more powerful, and much more dangerous. Jean is now her alterego, Phoenix, a force that cannot be controlled, and that might well wreak havoc on the world. But is there any way of saving her? And will Professor Xavier, Scott (James Marsden), Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Hally Berry) find it, before it is too late?<br /><br />On the whole, I think that you will like this film a lot, if you are already a fan of the series. It is more of the same, only a little better. In case you haven't watched the previous movies, give them a try before watching "X-Men - The Last Stand", because then you will understand better what is happening in this film. Of course, recommended :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: Don't leave the cinema as soon as the movie finishes, as there is a little and very surprising scene just after the credits finish rolling up. You will have to wait a few extra minutes, but believe me, it is worth it!<br /><br />PS2: There are new additions to the X-men, the most noteworthy being Beast, that is Dr. Hank Mcoy (played by Kelsey Grammer).</p></body></html>

Well, not entirely...But this is one of the few movies that had me just sitting in the dark when it was over, numb and overwelmed. The final 3-4 minutes of this film are so intense it would be hard to believe anyone could turn away; Yet this beautifully acted, sharply put together drug-love-tragedy doesn't end well for anyone, and will likely have a profound effect on those who make it to the end. Burstyn, like Keitel in 'Bad Lieutenant', throws herself into her part, devoid of any vanity or worry about how she looks on film. It is a brave, heartbreaking performance that remains one of the most unforgettable ones in recent film history. Everyone shines in this movie, and while the editing was an annoyance for some, I found it appropriate for the film...Strap yourself in and get ready to be be floored and depressed...But in a good way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Big and dopey, which is OK..."></head><body><p>My my my...what a stellar cast for such a bone-headed film. Yes, disaster flicks per se are not intended to be Shakespeare, and are known for predictability, but a good one is not flat-out stupid.<br /><br />OK. So, the core of the earth has stopped, possibly due to something called "Destiny", which resides in a standard-issue, mysterious but rectangular, hiding-in -plain-sight Government desert hangar thingee.<br /><br />It's time to burrow into the earth, blow stuff up with big bombs, and kick-start the earth's engine.<br /><br />Since there's no way this could work without something happening along the way, the back up plan involves using this "destiny" thing.<br /><br />Again.<br /><br />That's kinda stupid.<br /><br />Moving on, the actual coring through the earth was fun for the first part...crunching through the crust I guess you could say. Then it gets sort of psychedelic, like they're flying through some bad Peter Max LSD trip.<br /><br />I thought of the film, "Yellow Submarine."<br /><br />That's not complimentary to this film though.<br /><br />Certain scientific plot devices seem to be skimmed over, as if the filmmakers feel too much thought in any one area is "bad."<br /><br />There will always be a little of what I call "Yeah right" in any good disaster film. Any person with more than four functioning neurons will be able to point to a part in any end-of-the-world/city/state scenario, roll their eyes, and say, "Yeah...riiiight."<br /><br />That's OK. That's part of the charm of big, dumb fun movies.<br /><br />You just don't want to be thinking that too much or too often. Then "dumb" turns into "stupid".<br /><br />On the other hand, the set of actors they have for this film is staggering! Had they focused on the crew and their interactions while in the drill-train-shuttle, we could have really had something here. They work wonders with what they're given.<br /><br />And there ARE some genuinely exciting moments, as I forced myself to give in to this film. I love this sort of stuff; I just wanted it done a little better.<br /><br />"Armageddon", for all it's faults, is a big, dumb, fun film.<br /><br />This is no "Armageddon".<br /><br />Take that for what you will.</p></body></html>

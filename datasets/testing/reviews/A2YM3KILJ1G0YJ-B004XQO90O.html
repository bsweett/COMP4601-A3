<meta name="summary" content="D&eacute;j&agrave; vu + Quantum Leap = Source Code"></head><body><p>Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up inside the body of another man - get your mind out of the gutter, I mean "inside" like Quantum Leap - he must use his next eight minutes efficiently, because the train he's on is about to explode.  How does he know this?  Well, it turns out Stevens is part of the Source Code, a secret government program that can use "parabolic calculus" (whatever that is) to fold time and put him into another person's identity.  A little like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu with Denzel except their superior technology had a 4 day window and...actually, it's a LOT like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.<br /><br />This borderline plagiarism would have been better off using the term "velluvial matrix" instead of "parabolic calculus" to explain the technology, because there are numerous problems with the time travel aspects of this film.  For instance, if there is an 8-minute window, and the concept behind the limitations is glossed over, why can't it be 8.5 minutes?  Or 9 minutes?  For something so unknown and unexplained it sure has a strict timeframe.  Second, some of the movements and discoveries while possessing Chicago school teacher Sean Fentress are simply impossible.  If Fentress never did it, he couldn't possibly have the memories capable of supporting Stevens' escapades throughout the train.  What I'm trying to say is, ignore the metaphysical connections because the science is pointless.  Nonetheless, the majority of this film is enjoyable.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal exudes anguish in most roles, which made him perfect for Stevens.  He's unaware, dazed, and rushes through each 8-minute iteration with the gusto of irritable bowel sufferer.  Vera Farmiga, who I normally enjoy, appears to be coasting through her role as the pseudoscience facilitator, giving Stevens helpful guidance along the way (e.g. look for bags, hold on I'm playing Minesweeper).  Although, a more military and scientific approach to finding someone responsible for crimes in a parallel plain of existence would be to simply kill half of the people.  If the event doesn't happen, the culprit is in the dead half.  If it happens, next time around kill half of the left overs.  Divide by two ad nauseum.  Even the terrorist portion doesn't make a ton of sense.  One of the most predictable misdirections in cinema history is created when a Hollywood political slant is subtly inserted.  Ultimately, however, the movie asks more questions than it answers, and an ambiguous ending furthers the confusion.<br /><br />It's fun, well made, and performed well.  But if you think too deeply, the brain shutoff valve is necessary.</p></body></html>

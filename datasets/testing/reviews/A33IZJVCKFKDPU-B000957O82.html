<meta name="summary" content="The Role Smith Was Born To Play"></head><body><p>I cannot believe that Will Smith had never done a romantic comedy before "Hitch".  He has so much charisma that it would seem that he would have done about 10 of these type of movies by now.  But as it turns out, his first one "Hitch" is not bad and Will gets a little help from his co-star Kevin James.<br /><br />"Hitch" is a man named Alex Hitchins (Will Smith).  He is a "date doctor," meaning he helps pathetic guys to get really hot chicks that they would normally would not be able to get.  He has helped many men, and then comes Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is basically the type of guy that spills everything, says the wrong thing every time or does not have the nerve to say anything at all.  Albert wants to be able to get the movie star Allegra Coles.  So Hitch helps him and along the way he meets Sara Meles (Eva Mendes).  He falls for this girl and forgets everything that he teaches all of his clients by making a complete fool of himself.  Obviously thats where the humor comes in and then the dramtic climax of whether Hitch gets the girl or not.<br /><br />Will Smith does a great job as this character.  As mentioned earlier, his on-screen charisma makes him the perfect choice for this character.  The person that steals this movie from him is Kevin James.  Being a big "King of Queens" fan, he is the reason that I saw this movie and he did not disappoint.  Most of the movie's big laughs came from his antics.  I didn't really like Eva Mende's character.  She was too much of a pain in the neck (to put it nicely).<br /><br />This movie would be definately worth the watch, especially if you have a significant other to view it with.  It is funny and romantic, but I wouldn't say that its a chick flick.  So there you go guys, this one is okay to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Movies I've Seen!"></head><body><p>WOW!!  I had heard how good this movie is, but didn't realize it was that good. We saw the DVD for the first time over the weekend during a dinner party at a neighbor's house.  We were all very impressed with the tremendous struggle that Charles had to maintain, with the discrimmination, especially in the south.  Even some Afro-Americans were taking advantage of this blind black man.  Not only was he a musical genius, but also a survivor!<br /><br />I found it troubling how much Charles got caught in spider webs of drug abuse and unethical women, bound to get a hold of some of his fortune.  I was surprised that he had 12 children, many out of wedlock?  All an all, his life was success, because of the joy of music he brought to millions and millions around the globe.  I will never forget how Charles could deliver the song "America"...how he could make me shed a tear every time he sang that great song.<br /><br />I hope this film wins many awards.  It deserves a lot of praise!</p></body></html>

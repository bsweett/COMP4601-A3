I honestly don't know how to feel about it anymore; I saw this film with my mother, and when we left the theater, I saw she had tears in her eyes. "This is a beautiful film," she said quietly, wiping at her cheeks with a shriveled tissue. I was completely at a loss for words. How is this film beautiful, other than because of some moments of impressive digital effects? To say this story is cryptic would be a colossal understatement, and I just can't understand why it had to be so alternative that it alienated any sense of reason. This has to be the most aimless movie I've ever seen, going passive-aggressively from scene to scene with virtually nothing holding its individual moments together, save for a couple of weak narrative links.<br /><br />Now, you may be asking yourself, "What is this film about?" Well, that's the catch: I have absolutely no idea what this film is about, and I can't even begin to describe a cohesive plotline. The best I can offer are vague snippets of information, ones that make sense in and of themselves but have no structure when put together in the same movie. The most prominently featured motif is the idea of birth, death, and rebirth, physically represented at times by a mythical tree of life, at others by Rachel Weisz as both Queen Isabella of Spain and a modern-day cancer patient. What any one image has to do with the other is anyone's guess; there are three individual narratives in the film, each separated by several hundred years, each randomly weaving in and out of each other. They had little if any connection, other than the notion that one could live forever if he or she looks in the right place.<br /><br />One narrative takes place in the 1500s during the Spanish Inquisition. Hugh Jackman enters the film during this segment as a devoted conquistador willing to sacrifice himself for the salvation of Spain; apparently, a power-hungry inquisitor (Stephen McHattie) is slowly taking the country over, and he's about ready to attack the queen in a final display of torture. But according to the unrealistically calm queen, there is hope for their beloved country. As stated in Mayan legend, a miraculous tree resides deep within the jungles of New Spain (modern day Central America). Anyone who drinks of its sap will live forever. With such reliable information, the conquistador is sent to this land with a monk in order to find the tree. Exactly how going about this task would in any way, shape, or form help an oppressed country is beyond me. It would have been nice if some kind of an explanation were given, even if it was an unrealistic one.<br /><br />Another segment takes place in the present day. Jackman now plays Tommy, a doctor obsessed with finding a cure for cancer. His current patient is an ape named Donovan, who unfortunately has a brain tumor. When Tommy sees that Donovan is slipping further and further away from life, he decides to take drastic measures. With a quick rummage through an assortment of files, he finds what he's looking for: an organic material taken from a special tree found in Central America. Maybe an injection of this stuff will help the poor little simian recover. And sure enough, it does; his vital signs improve beyond anyone's expectations, and his head scar heals much more quickly than normal. Unfortunately, the tumor itself remains unscathed. This is incredibly distressing for Tommy; the whole point of doing this medical research is to help his wife, Izzi (Weisz), who's brain cancer is progressing to the point of diminishing her tactile sensitivity.<br /><br />This segment description may make it seem as if it's the most structured one of the film, but the reality is that it's just as out of place as the previous one. Consider the loss of Tommy's wedding ring; we see this object continually reappear throughout the film, originating as a charm on Queen Isabella's necklace. It must have been some kind of symbol, possibly the classic symbol of unity and commitment. But then why did it have to be lost in the first place? It only added another layer of drama to a story that was already overflowing. And then there's Izzi's book, which documents the life and death beliefs of the ancient Mayans. All but the last chapter is finished, and it's her wish that Tommy finish the book. He continually says that he can't, that he doesn't know the end, and that he doesn't know how to reach the end. Finally, one of the characters expresses what I've been feeling throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />The third segment is probably the most baffling one. It presumably takes place in the distant future, a time when people float through space in giant bubbles. This is the way we find a now bald and barefoot Hugh Jackman, trapped inside his own snow globe with a hair-covered tree. The unabashed strangeness of this segment can only be indicative of a spiritual mind excursion, so much so that any form of explanation would be pointless. Apparently, this bubble is heading for a nebula, one that surrounds a dying star. This dying star, according to Mayan legend, is the place where the life/death exchange takes place. Interestingly enough, Izzi had already identified this nebula during the present day segment by viewing it through her telescope. It also served as the basis for her book.<br /><br />As this futuristic Tommy floats through space, he hears voices, has fleeting hallucinations of both Izzi and Queen Isabella, and periodically cuts off a piece of the tree's hairy bark to chew on. He even tattoos himself with a fountain pen (which started in the present day segment after Tommy lost the ring). Like many other aspects of this movie, I can't explain the significance of any of it. That's probably why I disliked this movie; it's a visually stunning work, but the story is so convoluted and so mysterious that it prevents the viewer from understanding anything about it. I don't mind when a film relies heavily on visual material, but it should at least be part of a story that's actually about something.<br /><br />But even as I say this, I think back to my mother, who found the story so touching and meaningful that she was reduced to tears. I don't deny the possibility that I completely missed the point of this film, that I'm too mainstream a viewer to be entertained by this kind of narrative. Nonetheless, I can't recommend "The Fountain"; I see it as nothing but a gigantic mess, so loaded with abstract ideas that don't add up to anything comprehensible. If any of you reading this still intend to see it, I, of course, have no way of stopping you. Maybe it's just as well; you just might manage to get more out of it than I did.</p></body></html>

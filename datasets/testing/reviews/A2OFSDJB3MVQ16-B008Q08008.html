<meta name="summary" content="Polanski comes back with a masterpiece"></head><body><p>I'm not sure if I've submitted a review on this film but here goes.  After a series of disappointing films, director Roman Polanski came back with a vengeance with this personal tale of survival during the Holocaust. Winner of several Cesars and Oscars for Best Director & Best Actor (Adrian Brody), Polanski's dispassionate tone is just right for this film, never falling into sentimentality the way Spielberg did in "Schindler's List" (the only flaw in that Oscar winner) and Brody himself is consumatively excellent in the title role (he stated that he lost weight, his apartment & his girlfriend but kissed Halle Berry!!).  I am planning on acquiring the HD DVD version of this superb film which also touches on the irony of war.  The episode involving a Nazi officier (Thomas Kreutzman, who later reteam with Brody in "King Kong") befriending Spilzman is touching.  Recommended for all lovers of great cinema!!</p></body></html>

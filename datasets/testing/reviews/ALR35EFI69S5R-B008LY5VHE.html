<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Adventure Classic!"></head><body><p>This movie is a credit to everyone associated with it, from the stellar  cast of actors and actresses to the direction by Steven Speilberg to the  original story (a novel) and screenwriting by Peter Benchley. This is a  riviting tale superbly told, with excellent cinematography and special  effects, and a scary soundtrack that builds the edge of mystery to a  crescendo each time it musically announces the shark's appearence.  <p>The idea for the movie is deceptively simple; a great white shark with a  fond taste for the sweet taste of human flesh is patrolling the water off  Amity Island (read Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard)and terrorizing the  summer tourist population. Inject into this some interesting and novel  subplots regarding a burned-out city cop and unlikely undersung hero, a  brainy, affable but basically misunderstood young marine biologist, and a  wonderfully crusty old mariner turned professional shark fisherman and you  have the recipe for an entertaining rollercoaster ride. <p>This movie is a  modern classic, one with a young Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and the  late  Robert Shaw. Watching their characters interact is an afternoon's  entertainment well deserved, one that is durable and repeatable. It also is  one that translates very well into the DVD mode. One caution; don't view it  anytime before going for your summer vacation. You may really be afraid to  go back into the water!</p></body></html>

In the movie "Memento" starring Guy Pierce, gives a good performance as a man who suffers from a memory disorder in which he can't make new memories after a severe accident with a killer who murdered his wife. Since he cannot make new memories, he has to write all information on photographs. Guy Pierce does not know who his friends or enemies are. He has to rely on his photogrpah notes to catch the murderer. When you first watch the movie you maybe confused like I was, because they play the movie backwards. But in the end it all comes out to a great ending. Infact, I had to watch the movie again to look some parts over. The suspense and intensity is unbelievable. Like I said Guy Pierce gives a good solid performance along with Joey pants, (A friend or a foe). Whats sad is that the movie almost did not go into production. The movie was finished filming around 97' but did not get released in theaters till 2000. It was also played in very select theaters as well. But it still frustrates me when i see a great movie that doesn't get any respect. This is why i hate Hollywood, they pump all these bogus movies up like the sixth sense, the village, and all those other lame thrillers but this one is left in the dust? You wanna see interesting thriller see Memento it won't dissapoint you. As far as the dvd goes, 5 stars as well. The limited edition especially is amazing. Cool artwork and sweet packaging. the menu screens and chapter selections are interesting as well, it gives a good intro to the mood of the movie. The special features are interesting as well, solid commentary, nice behind the scenes, ect. Quality wise, this dvd  won't dissapoint you either, DTS. 5.1 surround sound and a clear crisp transfer. Buy this.....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, But...."></head><body><p>Prince Caspian is the follow-up to the the very popular Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia book series.<br /><br />Full of battle scenes, some pretty spectacular. Small children may struggle with fearful images. One scene was particularly sad involved several Narnians caught behind enemy lines awaiting death.<br /><br />As in the first movie loads of creatures make up Narnia's population. All had been living underground since shortly after the kings and queens of Narnia had returned to England. Sir Reepicheep mouse-knight is a nice addition adding humor and zest to the film. Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy are back -- called to help Narnia from the brink of extinction. Prince Caspian lands in Narnia as he runs for his life. His evil uncle has produced an heir so Caspian X needs to be exterminated. Aslan makes an appearance and the White Witch drops in for a short while.<br /><br />The story is so big and the cast so large that though the actors tried there was a feel of underdevelopment between several major relationships. I'd like to say I loved the film. And there are many reasons I liked it but several that just left me cold.</p></body></html>

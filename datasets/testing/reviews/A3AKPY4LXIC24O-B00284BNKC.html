It can mother the notions of what love must feel like. It can drag you through the darkest and most dire circle of hell. It can exploit a pessimist's worst apocalyptic vision into an immensely valuable anti drug statement. It can shock you scene after scene with its honesty and its unflinchingly brutal depiction of the desperation of the inner city, and at what price peace can there be achieved. One of the top five films produced in the past 20 years, and in the name of freedom of speech, priceless.</p></body></html>

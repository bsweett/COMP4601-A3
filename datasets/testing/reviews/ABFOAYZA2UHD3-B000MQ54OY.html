<meta name="summary" content="couldn't decide between 2 and 3 stars"></head><body><p>some 15 minutes before the end of the movie, i sent a message to my ex bf (who got the film for my son) a text msg saying "happy feet sux".<br /><br />he was supprised, and replied with "but it gor the oscar!"<br /><br />this is for the overall impression:<br /><br />going to the details, i agree with both spotlight reviews - apart from the amazing animation (in detail and mechanics of movement of both the animals and humans) this film is burdened with problems - from direction (pace), message, character development (even some of the main characters were pretty indistinguishable from one another), to the question of the main message of the movie (what sort of ending is that and what does it mean?!) and overall "heavy feeling" this film leaves you with.<br /><br />my son likes it cuz there is a lot of dancing (he dances to it) and some adventurous and funny scenes (he laughs a lot to it), so i guess i will keep it.<br /><br />nonetheless, compared to the cars and some other films, this is a sadly messed up piece of fine animation.</p></body></html>

It is a hybrid of 60's &quot;epic&quot; movies, 70's all-star-cast disaster flicks, and the late-70's special effects films (like STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<p>The DVD looks and sounds wonderful.  The extra's are very interesting - 3 documentaries illuminate the journey from page to screen.  The battles between director Richard Donner and his producers are fascinating.  However, in all fairness, one wishes the Salkinds (or someone on their side) could respond.  <p>There are some very cool early flying effects in the bonus stuff.  The screen tests are hilarious - Stockard Channing as Lois Lane would have been a hoot.  Lesley Anne Warren was an interesting choice as well.  However, when Margot Kidder's screen test appears it is obvious why she was chosen.  In her screen test she had a bad haircut and a 70's hippy dress on.  However, she simply glows with energy and the magic required to help the audience believe a man can fly.  <p>The film has held up well.  It moves from Greek-like Krypton to the Americana of Smallville to the zippy, campy feel of Metropolis.  Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luthor.<p>The re-inserted scenes are fine.  They are really minor additions to this great film.  They only help make it better.  (I'd really like to hear/see more of the SUPERMAN II cut scenes!)<p>SUPERMAN is a super DVD!</p></body></html>

Confidential," directed by Curtis Hanson, is an intense, compelling drama starring Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.  It's a time of growth in Southern California; freeways are on the drawing board, glitz and glamor abounds in Hollywood, and there's a lot of money to be made, especially for anyone with the right connections.  But there's a dark undercurrent running throughout the city as well.  The criminal element is thriving under the auspices of gangster Mickey Cohen, and it's a time when certain officers of the law tend to mete out their own, personal brand of justice, which doesn't necessarily land them on the right side of the fence, nor of the law.  There's graft within the L.A.P.D., and a prevalent misuse of authority and lack of ethics that begins at the top, filters down and permeates the entire force.  And when Cohen finally goes to jail, a number of his "associates" begin turning up dead, and strange and untoward things begin to happen in and around Hollywood.  Finally, a nocturnal massacre at a place called the "Nite Owl Cafe" kicks off an investigation that ultimately involves two young officers, Bud White (Crowe) and Ed Exley (Pearce), and a veteran of the narcotics squad, Jack Vincennes (Spacey).  And it isn't long before the proverbial can of worms is wrenched open and, needless to say, many lives are soon destined to be changed forever.  Working from an intelligent and extremely well written script (co-written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by James Ellroy), Hanson delivers this tightly woven, intricate story with a deft hand and an eye for detail that transports the audience to another time and place.  At the heart of the tale are White and Exley, both of whom are passionate about their work and the pursuit of justice, though they differ greatly in their respective methods and basic perceptions of how things should be and why.  And it's this contrast in personalities that becomes the impetus for the drama; what makes these guys tick, and which buttons can be pushed (and by whom) to get them going.  It's an examination of the complexities of human nature, and Hanson handles it all with skill and precision.  If you hadn't noticed Russell Crowe before this film, you will forever after.  His screen presence here is explosive, and he brings an intensity to his character that is almost unsettling.  You can see it in his eyes; the turmoil lying just beneath the surface, ready to erupt at any moment.  You can feel it just watching him.  It's a dynamic, multi-layered performance that is unforgettable.  Guy Pearce turns in a notable performance as well, entirely credible and believable, though he lacks Crowe's charisma and presence.  But, admittedly, the character of Exley doesn't command the sympathy that White's does; White, despite his propensity for violent action, exhibits a vulnerability that is absent in Exley, who comes off as rather cold and inaccessible.  But again, it's the differences between these two that gives the movie it's momentum.  Kevin Spacey also turns in another outstanding performance as the slick, self-assured "celeb" of the force, Jack Vincennes, the cop whose ethics have become self-serving and who's lost sight of why he joined the department in the first place.  Spacey readily conveys the fact that there is more to Vincennes than meets the eye, which we discover as the story unfolds.  And it's when we learn what's hidden beneath the surface that we realize what a terrific job Spacey has done in bringing this character to life.  And, not to be outdone by her co-stars, Kim Basinger (Lynn Bracken) turns in a performance as a Veronica Lake look-alike that won her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  With a supporting cast that includes Danny DeVito (Sid), David Strathairn (Pierce Patchett), Ron Rifkin (D.A. Ellis Loew) and Matt McCoy (Brett Chase), "L.A. Confidential" is an entertaining, absorbing drama that will linger in your memory for days after you've seen it.  Filmed on location in and around L.A. and Hollywood, this is a superlative piece of filmmaking that must be seen, especially by anyone who truly loves movies that are made the way movies "ought" to be made; this is one of them.</p></body></html>

Viewers looking for a conventional action or science fiction film will be disappointed, because "Children of Men" has much more of the spirit of an art film. In fact, each scene of the film, instead of being filled with CGI, is composed like a provocative painting. (In this manner it recalls another dystopian masterpiece "A Clockwork Orange".) The story itself revolves around the theme of hope. In a future where no children are being born, human life has been reduced to a mixture of despair, violence and empty pleasure-seeking. When a pregnant woman is discovered for the first time in 18 years, she becomes both a beacon of hope and a pawn in the political agendas of various societal elements.<br /><br />My friends who watched this film with me didn't like the film's open, anti-climactic ending. I thought it suited the film perfectly. Bravo.</p></body></html>

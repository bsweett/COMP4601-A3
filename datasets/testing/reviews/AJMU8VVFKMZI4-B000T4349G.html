<meta name="summary" content="Interesting concept...bad execution"></head><body><p>This is a horribly implausible storyline, but probably could have been better executed had it been an episode of the defunct X-Files.  The begining is intriguing but somewhere in the middle you sense that the writers didn't truely know where to go.  I think I could have swallowed this more, if in fact 'The Others' needed the children for something-not simply to watch this woman go crazy like a lab rat.  Her doctor even says that they've been doing this sort of thing for years-decades even.  So you're telling me they've been success of making people disappear and just watching the festivites?  For their own amusement?  But didn't the NSA guy-say something about survivial?  SO which is it?  You needed the children to survive or do you need them for amusement?  And even if you buy that this is a one time experiment gone wrong-and you buy into the Disney-like fairy tale ending-that still leaves the problem of aliens hoovering above doing what they will.  So is the ultimate goal to get the children back or do away with the aliens.  How can you buy into the peace of mind and security when the children return but know they are still out there?<br /><br />Julianne Moore give a good performance-for the material, I think.  Dominic West made me wince each time he came onto the screen.  Overall-save ninety minutes of your life and skip this one.</p></body></html>

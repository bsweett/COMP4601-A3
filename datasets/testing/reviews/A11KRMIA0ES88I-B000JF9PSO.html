It comes back, planes flying into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. We recall Todd Beamer and "Let's roll" although his call to arms is subdued. This is a sympathetic portrayal. Even the terrorists are human. They are nervous and shown muttering prayers. They believe in their twisted mission. A picture of the U.S. Capitol is posted in the cockpit, so we assume it was the target of the 4th plane.</p></body></html>

Man on Fire is incredibly dark and violent, leading you into the underground world of organized kidnappings in Mexico City.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is John Creasey, an ex-operative who is now an admitted alcoholic.  He takes a job protecting a wealthy young couple's little girl named Pita (Fanning).  Pita breaks through Creasey's tough exterior and gives him a reason to live.  Now I know what you are thinking.  This sounds so Pollyanna-ish.  Lord help me, it is not.<br /><br />Pita is kidnapped.  The drop of the ransom money is compromised, as a third party, not related to the kidnappers, steals the ransom.  When the girl's mother begs the "voice" on the phone to spare Pita, he says it is too late.<br /><br />So begins Creasey's one-man war on the corrupt order of Mexican police know as El Hermandad (The Brotherhood).  He wants to kill everyone remotely involved in Pita's abduction and murder.<br /><br />Kidnappings, or "secuestros" are a real problem in Latin America.  Everyone knows the police down there are highly corrupt, and this movie is bold in that it is not afraid to be politically incorrect.<br /><br />Performances all around are superb.  Even the guys who are about to die at Creasey's hand - you really feel they are going through this incredible emotion.</p></body></html>

Now he takes that idolization of horror films to a new level by making one himself.<br /><br />The trials and tribulations of getting this film released are now a part of legend. After screening a rough cut of the film for a test audience and the brass at Universal Studios, Zombie was boosted by the crowd's reaction. The same couldn't be said for the studios chief who deemed the film morally reprehensible. Selling it back to Zombie, he finally got MGM to cough up some money to make a few changes and to release the film. A comment on MTV, a joke about them apparently having no morals, led to their dropping the film as well. Finally, Lions Gate, a film company willing to take chances, picked the film up and fans had their chance to see what the controversy was all about.<br /><br />Police guarded doors to theaters across the country. If you weren't 18 years old, you weren't going to see this movie, released with an R rating. But horror fans flocked and the movie became enough of a hit to garner a sequel now in the works. So what was the who ha all about?<br /><br />The story takes place on Halloween night, 1977. Four young people (Chris Hardwick, Jennifer Jostyn, Erin Daniels and Rain Wilson) are on a cross country tour, checking out forgotten roadside attractions and writing about them. One night, they stop in at Captain Spaldings, a gas station that sells fried chicken and has its own Museum of Monsters and Madmen. In love with the place, they take the tour.<br /><br />Along the way they are treated to tales of cannibals and crazies that ends with the story of Dr. Satan, a local madman who worked in the nearby asylum. There, he conducted unusual experiments on patients, driving them madder than they were. Once discovered, he was lynched in a wood close by. But the next day, his body was gone and never found.<br /><br />Fascinated, the group asks for directions to the tree where the doctor was hung. Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) gives them directions and off they go.<br /><br />In the middle of a rain storm, the travelers pick up a hitchhiker named Baby (Sheri Moon). When their tire goes flat, she takes one of them home with her and sends out her brother to pick up the car and bring the rest. What the group sees is a weird world indeed.<br /><br />The house is a collection of oddities, from the grouping of baby dolls nailed to the wall to the odds and ends that surround them. Things get a little hairy during an after dinner show the family is putting on to celebrate Halloween, and the group leaves. At least they try to.<br /><br />Stopped by the family and captured, they awake to find themselves the prisoners of a maniacal group of murderers, known to the viewers already since we have seen their earlier captures, a group of missing cheerleaders. One by one the group is killed off or tortured until a moonlight ceremony finds them exposed to the real Dr. Satan and his crew. To give more away would ruin the fun.<br /><br />Zombie, who wrote and directed, has made an incredibly great looking movie. The camerawork that one would associate with a movie like this far exceeds all expectations. He has gone on record as saying that this movie is his tribute to the horror films of the seventies, the visceral, crazy filled movies that had kids captured and seeking escape. While watching, you get an idea of movies that influenced him, everything from the obvious choices (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) to the less known (MOTHER'S DAY).<br /><br />Zombie also uses a number of devices to make your skin crawl and to catch you off guard. Scenes intercut with the action depicting interviews with the killers or glimpses into what they've done behind the scenes offer shocks. Garish lighting effects of red and blue spots give off a weird feeling as well.<br /><br />Does the movie offer scares? You bet, plenty of them. Does it truly pay tribute? Of course! Should it have been this controversial? No. It may be a gut wrenching film, but how is this morally reprehensible while films like THE REAL CANCUN showing real teens getting drunk and having sex is not? At least this isn't real....I hope. Is it worth seeing? For fans of horror this one is a must see. It's spawning a sequel (mentioned earlier), a series of action figures and its own comic book. Get in on the excitement early on.<br /><br />The DVD offers a ton of extra features. Behind the scenes footage, a making of featurette, casting sequences, interviews, director commentary, at least 2 easter eggs and more.<br /><br />When I saw this in the theater, my hopes were high and I expected so much. At the time I was disappointed. In watching the movie again, I now understand better and appreciate more of what Zombie was doing, what he was trying to show. This is a movie that gets better the second time around. And DVD offers you that and more. Give it a watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Little Choppy"></head><body><p>I like history and am glad I watched this film, but I probably will not watch it again.  The scenery is pretty and I was impressed by how many stars were used in filming.  My two biggest disappointments were: 1) the choppy nature of the film.  They tried to cram a LOT of information into a short time span.  The continual scene changes back and forth through history added to the choppyness.  And, 2) the directors failure to create a lead character (Alexander) that I could symphasize with.  I didn't actually like the character of Alexander and was unmoved when bad things happened to him.<br /><br />Taste is a difficult thing to get a handle on.  Another person might watch this film and want to add it to their collection, but it just didn't move me.</p></body></html>

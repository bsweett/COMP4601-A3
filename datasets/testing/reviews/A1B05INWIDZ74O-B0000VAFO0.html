<meta name="summary" content="An Entertaing Dark Gothic Thriller"></head><body><p>Underworld starts out with a long action sequence. Things do slow down enough for us to learn that our hero is a vampire by the name of Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale, who has devoted her unlife to destroying lycanthropes. Selene stumbles upon a conspiracy between the vampire leader, Kraven, and the werewolf leader, Lucian, which involves a human named Michael, who is a host to a strain of some strain of plague that is never explained. Fearing that Kraven's actions may place the vampires in jeopardy, Selene does the unthinkable; she awakens the ancient vampire noble, Viktor so he can stop Kraven.<br /><br />In the middle of the movie we move away from some of the action and we get our characters doing a lot of talking, plotting, and running through dark wet streets. We get all of our back-story of how the vampire/werewolf war got started in the first place via flashbacks. And there's a forbidden romance budding between Selene and Michael.<br /><br />The movie looks sufficiently offbeat to be interesting, although the muted colors and lack of anything resembling bright light becomes does get a little old. Be nice to see what the vampires did when the sun was up. Kate Beckinsale does look dangerous and sexy in a skintight leather suit, but there is not much acting for her to do in this film. Scott Speedman doesn't need to do anything more than exude a primal wildness, which he succeeds at. And everyone else has to appear sinister.<br /><br />Even though, I found Underworld be an entertaining view. The big battle at the end is fun, although the final scene seems to be an introduction for a sequel. So get your popcorn, and watch the movie. You will not be sorry...though it is no one I will be watching multiple times.</p></body></html>

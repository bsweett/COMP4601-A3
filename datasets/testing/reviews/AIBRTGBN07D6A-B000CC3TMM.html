<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely ridiculous"></head><body><p>I wasn't expecting much from this movie. I thought it would have some mindless action in it, and be entertaining. It was. However you REALLY have to maintain suspension of disbelief. Many of the scenes were absolutely absurd. Of course it had the crazy action moves that no one can physically do. I was expecting that. However there's one scene where Frank is in a plane that crashes into the ocean from about 40,000 feet up with no injuries. Apparently if you land in water it softens the blow and everything's okay. There are several other scenes like this, equally as bad. I cannot recall a movie I have ever seen that takes things like that to such an extreme. The stunts in this movie blatantly violate the laws of physics. The other bad part of this movie is the script has several huge plot holes. A virus is released that is supposed to kill people within 4 hours, but we never find out if the virus was stopped, and if so (which you can assume it is), how they were able to do it.<br /><br />Aside from that, I wouldn't really say the movie is bad. It is mindless entertainment with some decent acting. Horrible CGI however. I can't think of anyone but a huge Transporter fan who would want to own this and watch it several times. The only thing redeeming about this movie is the really awesome action sequences. As long as you realize this film takes place in an alternate universe where none of this stuff is possible, you'll be okay.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best animated super hero movie, bar none"></head><body><p>A truly enjoyable movie for anyone who ever enjoyed comic books.<br /><br />I think this is without a doubt the best animated film to take on the task of taking the comic book hero genre into a movie. Numerous touches, small and large, bring back the atmosphere we always imagined as kids.<br /><br />Additionally, this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy together. The scary scenes are tolerable for young kids and don't last overly long. There is plenty of comedy for adults, and enough 'cool factor' for everyone. You'll come to care about the family of Incredibles with their challenges and problems, and revel in the clever ways the writers have the family, and their super powers, come together.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful to behold.<br /><br />I just watched it again recently, and enjoyed it every bit as much as when I first watched it when it came out.</p></body></html>

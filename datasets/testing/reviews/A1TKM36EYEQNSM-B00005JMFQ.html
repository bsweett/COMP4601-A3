<meta name="summary" content="Really a 3 and a Half - Great Cast and Casting"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the concept of this movie and the cast was just tremendous. <p>I felt it was like watching the British All-Stars.  All of the acting they did was outstanding, yet the movie troubled me.<p>It was Love Actually, actually it was more about dysfunctional lives and relationships.  <p>The warm part of the movie and the potential starts and ends with those at the airport, the mosiac of loved ones hugging one another and a reference to 9-11 and the question is there still love in the world.  This is the most touching piece of filmography I can remember.  With Hugh Grant narrating as people come up hugging and crying and laughing, you witness love, actually.<p>There are some great moments in this movie with some great twists.  <p>I felt the down side though was that there was too much flirtation with cheating, dicussing sex to a young child that was way beyond his years, fairly graphic shots of a couple progressively 'practicing' sex scenes for lighting.  If just this last one was eliminated the movie could be a classic because there are dysfunctions in life.  Yet I felt there were too many that did not really show the love, actually, shown at the airport.<p>It is a good movie for couples to discuss relationships and where they see themselves.  There are some cute relationships and some neat twists, yet it is not for everyone.</p></body></html>

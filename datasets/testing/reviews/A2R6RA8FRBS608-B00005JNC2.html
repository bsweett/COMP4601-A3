Although the acting is quite good and the cinematography is excellent; you're going to have to like romantic comedies to enjoy this flick. Look also for a good performance by Ian Holm.<br /><br />When the action starts, a young man named Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for nine years. Andrew has been moderately successful as an actor in California; but he is largely tormented by the pills his psychiatrist father gives him to keep him calm, or, as Andrew puts it, "numb." At the funeral (and after) Andrew meets up with some old buddies Mark, Dave and Jesse (Peter Sarsgaard, Alex Burns and Armando Riesco, respectively). They have some mildly fun times; but things go in a whole new direction for Andrew when he meets Samantha (Natalie Portman).<br /><br />Samantha and Andrew befriend each other and slowly Samantha's warmth and natural charm make Andrew feel true emotions again; this is helped in part by Andrew's going off his medication for the first time in many years. Although Andrew feels some pain and there are ups and downs with Sam, he slowly begins to trust her and they being together as friends.<br /><br />Of course, things get more complicated. What would happen if Samantha and Andrew start a romance and Andrew decides to go back to California? After all, he's only been in New Jersey four days when he has to return to his job in California. In addition, Andrew and his father (Ian Holm) have unfinished business to clear up between them--how will that work? And what about Andrew's guilt about an accident with his mother? No plot spoilers here, folks--get the movie and find out!<br /><br />The DVD comes with deleted scenes, "blooper" scenes, a running commentary by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman, the "making of" extra--and more. That's very good.<br /><br />Garden State is truly a film for those of us who like romantic comedies. I'm not especially wild about this genre; although I will admit that Garden State is one of the better romantic comedies out there. The acting is quite convincing; Natalie Portman shines on the screen. In addition, Zach Braff should be commended for writing a solid screenplay.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3 Notable Comic Performances. Otherwise Mediocre at Best."></head><body><p>A &quot;retrieval expert&quot; named Beck (The Rock) travels to Brazil to find Travis Walker (Seann William Scott), the errant son of an American gangster, and bring him back to his father in Los Angeles. Once in Brazil, Beck finds that Travis is beholden to a man named Hatcher (Christopher Walken), the megalomaniacal owner of a huge gold-mining operation. He becomes embroiled in a  race to find an ancient treasure hidden in the jungle that is sought by Travis, Hatcher, and the local tribespeople who want to free themselves from Hatcher's mines.<p>&quot;The Rundown&quot; is a comic action adventure movie. It has a silly plot and acrobatic fight sequences that are more preposterous than anything from The Rock's pro wrestling career. But if you can get past that, &quot;The Rundown&quot; features 3 good comic performances that are the backbone of this film. The Rock is often compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, but he's a lot funnier. And whereas Schwarzenegger and Stallone are known for their stoic countenances, The Rock has an unusually expressive face, which he puts to good comic use here. Pro wrestling fans may like Beck's fight sequences, but a wider audience will enjoy his comic scenes. Seann William Scott once again proves that he's an actor who will do anything for a laugh as Travis, a kooky would-be archeologist. And Christopher Walken's deadpan delivery of Hatcher's ruthless, preposterously funny lines is priceless. These three actors are the only thing that makes &quot;The Rundown&quot; watchable. But if you're a fan of The Rock, Walken, or Scott, this might be worth seeing. It's no surprise that The Rock is a competent action star, but even a mediocre film like &quot;The Rundown&quot; shows him to be a very charismatic screen presence with a good deal of comic talent. Better script next time, hopefully.<p>The DVD: This is a nice package for a single disc. Bonus features include 2 audio commentaries, 6 featurettes, deleted scenes, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), and bios for cast and crew. One audio commentary is by director Peter Berg and The Rock. The other is by producers Kevin Misher and Marc Abraham. The featurettes: &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; is a documentary about the film's fight scenes. &quot;The Amazon, Hawaii Style&quot; is about re-creating and filming the Brazilian jungle in Hawaii and features a lot of mutual comic criticism by The Rock and Seann William Scott. &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; is about the film's special effects. &quot;The Rundown Uncensored&quot; is a faux (spoof) documentary about The Rock's illicit onset relationship with the film's baboon star, Camilla. &quot;Running Down the Town&quot; is about the creation, in California, of the small Brazilian rain forest town where the film takes place, narrated by production designer Thomas Duffield. &quot;Walken's World&quot; is about the Hatcher character and his domain. All featurettes include interviews with the film's stars and director Peter Berg. Looking for a simple making-of documentary? Try &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;. Like the film's humor, particularly in the style of Seann William Scott? Try &quot;The Amazon, Hawaii Style&quot; and &quot;The Rundown Uncensored&quot;. &quot;Running Down the Town&quot; is impressive, if you're interested in production design. The disc has 3 unavoidable previews before the film. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French, and captioning is available in English. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></body></html>

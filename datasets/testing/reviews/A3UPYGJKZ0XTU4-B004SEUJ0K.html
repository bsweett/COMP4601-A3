<meta name="summary" content="More Provocative and Perhaps Less Heroic than Previous Movies."></head><body><p>"X-Men: The Last Stand" introduces some provocative ideas and leaves us almost convinced that this will be the last X-Men movie for a long time. Mutants and humans are living in relative harmony, with Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), aka Beast, serving as Secretary of Mutant Affairs to a sympathetic U.S. President. The peace is shattered when a pharmaceutical company announces that it can produce a "cure" for the mutant-X gene, allowing Mutants to become normal homo sapiens if they so choose. The Mutant community is divided over whether this is a good thing, and assurances are given that the "cure" is entirely voluntary. Meanwhile, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is discovered alive but no longer able to suppress the violence of her powers. Magneto (Ian McKellan) uses the "cure" controversy to incite Mutants against humans and plans to destroy the source of the drug.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" incorporates some elements from the X-Men comic that we haven't' seen before in the movies, such as the Danger Room and the Dark Phoenix storyline. New characters are Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Angel (Ben Foster), and Beast. Beast comes off pretty well. He, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and Magneto are the most developed characters, leaving the others to come and go in the periphery. There is too little of Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), as always. The debate over whether or not Mutants should take the "cure" is interesting. But the film's view of using the "cure" as a weapon is morally confused. Perhaps that is deliberate, but it's unsatisfying. I rate "X3" the same as the previous films in terms of story, characters, and action. But this film's themes are a little more contentious.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): There are 24 deleted scenes available with optional commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. There are 2 trailers for X3, Trailer A (1 ? min) and Trailer B (2 ? min), along with trailers for other films. There are 2 audio commentaries. The first audio commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn is conversational and often joking. It takes us through the story with some technical details and comments on structure. The 2nd audio commentary by producers Avi Arad, Lauren Shuler Donner, and Ralph Winter is more informative, addressing visual effects, locations, tone, story, actors, elements from the comic books, and other technical issues. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

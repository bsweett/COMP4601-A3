It's a rehash of hash, so to speak, and should be approached accordingly.<br /><br />We all know the plot at this point, so repeating it here seems unnecessary. What you're probably looking for is whether you should watch it. Here's the guide: if you loved the first two Final Destination films and thought they were boffo clever, then you'll like this. If you're curious to see what the fuss is about (they did make three films, after all), don't bother with this one. See the first (also directed by James Wong). It was better.</p></body></html>

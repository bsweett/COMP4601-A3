The Elf king builds a golden menchanical army to ward off the humans. Upon seeing this destruction the king makes a pact with them. He breaks his crown that controls the army into 3 pieces, giving 1 to the humans. His son disagrees and goes into exile. Fast forward to the present, the magic world is dying and man is thriving. Prince Nuada vows to restore his people by claiming all 3 pieces and reigniting the golden army. It's up to Hellboy and the rest of the BPRD to prevent the destruction of man!<br /><br />Del Toro's sequel is rich in detail, amazing sets and strange creatures. Unfortunately, it doesn't surpass the sequel because it is alittle too campy at times. The visuals are stunning and the story compelling. The campiness doesn't hurt the movie and is a must own for Hellboy fans.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: I can't rave enough about how beautiful this transfer is! Universal does it again. The golds, ambers, reds and blues are wonderful. The sound is rich and robust. All special features are ported over. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></body></html>

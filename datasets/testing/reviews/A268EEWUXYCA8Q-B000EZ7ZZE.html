<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the first, doesn't fit in the game universe"></head><body><p>First of all, I need to get my biases out of the way.  I have followed and played almost every Resident Evil game (both good and bad) from the very first one on the Playstation through the latest and by far the greatest on the Gamecube.  When I heard they were making a Resident Evil movie, I was uncertain of how I felt; were they going to remake a game into a movie or would they create a movie that fit into the Resident Evil mythos?  The first movie did the latter, introducing new characters while fitting pretty nicely into the mythology of the RE videogames.  It wasn't a great movie by far, but it was at least quasi-faithful to the series.<br /><br />Now we have Resident Evil Apocalypse which falls into the former category as it takes familiar characters and incorporates basically parts of Resident Evil 2 and 3 into movie form.  Unfortunately, it falls flat for me.  On one hand, I was thrilled to finally see the Nemesis on the big screen.  Being the unstoppable killing machine that he is and spouting that famous gravelly line, "STARS!" I was immediately excited to see the movie but I was worried how they would incorporate Alice from the movie with Jill from the video game.<br /><br />To be faithful to the video games, you can't.  It's that simple.  By having this movie, it's as if Resident Evil 3 never took place.  It takes the premise of the movie: people trapped in Raccoon City with zombies and the Nemesis, and completely changes the story.  Every time I started to get pulled into the movie, something would happen that would make me go, "wait, that didn't happen in the game."<br /><br />That said, my friends who haven't played any of the Resident Evil games had a fun time.  I think those who haven't played the video game will have a better chance of enjoying it.  Although, video game aside, I think the action is pretty stale and there's not a build up of tension like in the first movie.  I enjoyed RE 1 much more than this sequel and so did my friends (both RE junkies and not).  However, this movie and this series is much much much better than the majority of video game adaptations.  With movies like House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, even this movie stands as a king above them which is kind of sad.<br /><br />At any rate, not as good as the first, not very faithful to the video game series and not very thrilling.  But, it can be enjoyable for a rent or to see the Nemesis in a movie.  Hopefully the third movie RE Afterlife will take place before Resident Evil 4 (the game) and won't deal *directly* with any of the games.</p></body></html>

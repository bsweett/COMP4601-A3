<meta name="summary" content="Much better than I expected"></head><body><p>Hellboy has some large shoes to fill and a lot to live up to considering that it seems like everyone and their grandmother is making movies about superheros these days.<br /><br />It is actually very good and definatly not one you want to take home and watch with your girlfriend guys(figured that out myself).  The acting is very good and Hellboy is protrayed very correctly as a loveable wisecracking demon who just can't seem to find his place in society.<br /><br />It is only the plot thin and after a certain point there is only so much I can tolerate(even for a superhero movie).<br /><br />So using me own private little rating system<br /><br />Superman<br /><br />Spiderman<br /><br />Hellboy<br /><br />Daredevil<br /><br />Hulk<br /><br />Overall-Just a fun action Friday night if you are into superhero movies you should get this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Rated R Comedy is Back"></head><body><p>Vince Vaughn makes this film what it is, not to mention the hot Rachel McAdams (love her smile). I was never a huge fan of his, but his comedic timing is on spot and he has never been funnier. Owen Wilson is great as well as the straight man and he plays off well with Vaughn's rapid fire dialogue. This movie had me laughing out loud at least a couple of dozen times and I didn't want it to end. This will be a keeper in my DVD collection for sure. As Vince Vaughn's character would say, "Go out and get some strange a**!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like Drinking From A Garden Hose"></head><body><p>I just can't say enough about this movie. Thirty years after its initial release, it still holds up well and is the ultimate dystopia on film. Through its nightmarish view of a world where crime and chaos appear unstoppable to its equally nightmarish view of humanity in general, this film packs so much information on the human condition and our present day society that it is possible to feel like you are drinking from a garden hose, as there is so much being thrown at you at once that it is simply impossible to appreciate all of it.<p>The story opens up showing Alex, the protagonist played by Malcolm McDowell, and his three droogs, or gang members. Initially we see them performing all kinds of "ultraviolence" and rape. Then, later, when Alex becomes angry with his droogs and punishes two of them, they turn on him and leave him for the police. Placed in a bleak prison, he hears of a new treatment that will get him out of prison in a matter of weeks. He enthusiastically signs up, but he soon finds out that this treatment will make him physically sick at the sight of violence, sex and even upon hearing his beloved Beethoven. Released back into society, he soon becomes the victim as that timeless human truism, whatever goes around comes around, is proven correct.<p>There are so many themes and aspects of the human condition explored here that it is simply impossible to list them. Just a few are the innate moral condition of man, generally, the criminal mind, victims of crime, media exploitation, the old versus the young, and what happens when the ethics are pushed aside in favor of expediency or safety. All this being said, it is not a film for everyone. There is a lot of violence, sex, and nudity, so prudes need not apply. Certainly if you enjoy films where every question is answered and solutions to all of the problems are easy to find, this is not for you either. A Clockwork Orange raises many issues and also answers them, although you will have to watch closely to find them.<p>Finally, the technical side. Malcolm McDowell does a fantastic job playing malevolent Alex, grasping the nuance and contradiction that make him tick. Kubrick is perfectly in tune with Burgess' novel, able to add touches that perfectly complement the book. He makes the story his own without compromising what made the book so good. Excellent score and cinematography make it seem as if you are there with Alex.<p>If you are looking to see a film that examines the human condition without embellishing at all, gritty in the truest sense, you cannot go wrong with this movie. Although strange and not always easy to watch, it stays with you and reminds you of its timeless points constantly</p></body></html>

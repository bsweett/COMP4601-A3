<meta name="summary" content="HIGHLY ENTERTAINING GRITTY POLICE DRAMA! 4 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>'Training Day' is a dark and gritty crime drama that tells a different side of the men in blue. Denzel Washington takes a 180 and plays one vicious and dirty cop who shows a new recruit on his first day as a special teams narcotics officer how his brand of justice works! The film is slick, well paced, full of action and has a semi-plausible storyline. It does go a little Hollywood towards the end, but it's still a very entertaining movie. The film has an small early role featuring Eva Mendes(in her birthday suit!), giving us the money shot! Nice huh? ;-b The DVD transfer is excellent and has some interesting extra material.</p></body></html>

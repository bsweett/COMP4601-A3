<meta name="summary" content="One bloated, bloody mess."></head><body><p>Robert Rodriguez's &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; is the last of the &quot;El Mariachi&quot; trilogy that introduced the director to the cinematic zeitgeist, and he has stuffed it full of characters, subplots and faux Mexican patriotism in a grab for prestige. Too bad half the film is missing. An ardent supporter of the &quot;freedoms&quot; of digital filmmaking, Rodriguez had the material - and, presumably, the digital canvas - to produce a violent, angry epic, Sam Peckinpah style, as long and hard-boiled as you like it, if a little short of the Sergio Leone masterpiece to which the movie's title refers. Instead, &quot;Mexico,&quot; at less than two hours, equates to a series of glancing blows, and is generally an incoherent mess. <p>Antonio Banderas, guitar player/hitman of the previous film, &quot;Desperado,&quot; returns, essentially, to shoot guns for CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) who's looking to stir up trouble for the Mexican president. Sands plays twelve angles at once, pushing the buttons of the Mariachi, a foxy cop (Eva Mendes), a Mexican drug lord (Willem Dafoe), an ex-FBI agent (Ruben Blades) with a score to settle with the drug lord, and the drug lord's right-hand American creep (Mickey Rourke). And a general. And the president. And the president's advisor, a modern Brutus. And Enrique Iglesias. And on and on. <p>Depp is unquestionably the movie's star, and Rodriguez seems to have written more into Agent Sands then the rest of the movie combined: Is it necessary for Depp to offer a speech, however cute, on the type of shredded pork he prefers to eat in Mexico, then shoot the chef for making it too well, when a military coup is one of the movie's backdrops? The half-cocked, androgynous approach that clicked in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; falls flat here; to quote Sands Chuck Berris is a wee bit more believable spy. Banderas is a sweaty cipher, Dafoe is barely there. A bewildered Rourke can't seem believe he signed up to pet a little dog as his performance.  Blades puts a little meat on his role, but even he is a plot soldier, getting a paycheck, pulling his gun when required.  <p>In his apparent nirvana over a digital workshop in his garage, Rodriguez is getting sloppy. His movie is littered with violent showdowns that haven't bothered to build up a pretext for their existence. They erupt, splatter, sputter. His rapid-fire editing obliterates the continuity of every gunfight. There are inspired ideas - Agent Sands meets a particularly grotesque-yet-heroic end - but the heart of &quot;Desperado&quot; has been traded out for delusions of grandeur. Rodriguez has managed a trilogy, all right: &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; is an unsatisfactory western, action and noir film.<p>And now I mention Salma Hayek. It's important to understand Hayek headlined the advertising campaign for this movie, made the talk show/magazine rounds, had star billing above Depp, no less. In &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico,&quot; blink and you'll miss her. Think I'm kidding? Cheech has more screen time, and his character dies. For that matter, so does Carolina, Hayek's persona - before the events in the movie even occur. Most movie marketing is cynical. Few ploys are this cheap.</p></body></html>

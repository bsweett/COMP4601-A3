<meta name="summary" content="Not really a comedy"></head><body><p>I expected this film to be a comedy. There were a few funny scenes, but the overall seriousness of the main character's medical prognosis dominates the tone of the movie.<br /><br />Nicholson does very well with his role, but it's the same type of character we've seen him play many times before. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. Both are excellent actors, but they really aren't treading new territory with this outing.<br /><br />Also, the story is rather predictable and the characters seem to be cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />So why 4 stars?<br /><br />This movie has a lot of heart and delivers a beautiful message. It causes the watcher (or it SHOULD cause) to reflect inward and take a good look at himself (or herself). What am I doing with my life? How is my life affecting others? How do I want to be remembered?<br /><br />Sappy? Yes. Sentimental? Yes.<br /><br />But life can often be those things. How we deal with death is just as important as how we deal with life (I think Captain Kirk once said words to that effect, but I digress).<br /><br />Give this movie a try and watch it with a loved one. I guarantee the ending will make you smile.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exceedingly gory, gratuitously violent, eminently moving."></head><body><p>Braveheart is one of those films that I have watched every year or so since it came out on VHS. I have bought two DVD versions now as well.<br /><br />On the one hand it is such a violent and bloody movie, I would normally have had all I needed with one viewing, but on the other hand, even with the unbelievable heroism on the part of the protagonist, it is a moving tale of Honor, National Pride, and even ethnic pride (even though my family is Welsh and My wife's Irish, I still feel for the courage in the stories of the Celts of all persuasions).<br /><br />I really loved some of the speeches in the film, one of my favorites was a short rebuke to the Scottish Nobles, "You think the people exist to serve the Nobility, but the Nobility exist to serve Scotland" (or something close to that) but the message is true for politicians and leaders and managers in every land. Leadership is the serving and protection of those we lead, not vice-versa.<br /><br />But the main thing is for me is the overall message of the film, without freedom there is no living. I have to be in the right mood, but this remains one of my all time favorites.</p></body></html>

The whole &quot;backwards&quot; premise works amazingly well, and is one of the best ideas ever devised for a film, reminiscant of PULP FICTION. Guy Ritchie is Sammy, a man who loses his short term memory when his wife is murdered and he gets attacked. Joe Pantiliano (THE MATRIX) is Lenny, a guy who may, or may not be Sammy's friend. The search for the elusive &quot;John. G&quot; provides for some chilling moments. Sammy's condition forces him to tattoo himself with notes like &quot;Never answer the phone&quot;, which racks up the tension and pushes the limits of audience's cerebral limitations. One of those films which you have to watch two or three times to fully understand it and get the whole idea, it's endless in it's creative concepts, leaving the viewer surprised and somewhat confused. Director Nolan does the best with the inventive tricks and piecing together the plot machinations. And extra kudos for the editor, not to mention the brooding score throughout the film's running time. In short, it's a fantastic film, and deserves to be placed high in the great &quot;Film Noir&quot; masterpieces.</p></body></html>

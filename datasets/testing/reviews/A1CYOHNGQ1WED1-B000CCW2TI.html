She meets a man in line and begins a flirtatious conversation. When she boards the plane, it seems serendipity has placed them in seats aside one another. After the plave takes off, however, the man reveals that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate a high ranking government official who just happens to be arriving at the hotel McAdams manages. She is the only one with the authority to change the official's room to the specific one the killers want him in. He also reveals that their is a man sitting outside her father's house. If she doesn't cooperate, her father will be killed. McAdams spends the flight trying to find a way to keep her father alive, but also not comply with the killers.<br /><br />Red Eye is short compared to most movies these days but is just the right length for a thriller like this. There are no wasted scenes and a lot of talking that doesn't get you anywhere. There is just enough character set-up so you can feel for McAdams and Cillian Murphy does a nice job of underplaying his hitman character. He's nasty enough that you believe he could hurt you, but he doesn't chew the scenery the way some actors would have. I found Red Eye to be a taut, well-acted and written thriller.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Films of 2006"></head><body><p>"Thank You for Smoking" which marks the debut of Jason Reitman (son of Ivan) quickly became one of the most acclaimed films of 2006. Not hard to see why. This movie is probably one of the best American comedies of the year; Satire doesn't come around as often in film as it used to and when it does, it's usually not done very well. "Thank You for Smoking" does it perfectly. Aaron Eckart ('Suspect Zero') plays Nick Naylor, the Vice President of The Center of Tobacco Studies. Nick's job is to talk to people and convince them that smoking is not as bad as it seems. He even gets together with friends (Maria Bello & David Koechner), who work to make light of simalar products, to see who's product causes the largest death toll. This group, I might add, is called The M.O.D. Squad (short for "Merchants of Death"). Nick's job interferes with his personal life. He's divorced from his wife (Kim Dickens, 'Truth or Consequences, N.M.') and only sees his son (Cameron Bright, 'Birth') on weekends; A sexy reporter (Katie Holmes) is using him to score a big story; And he even ends up getting kidnapped at one point. The movie's all-star cast also features Robert Duvall, William H. Macy, J.K. Simmons (who plays Nick's boss BR), Adam Brody, Rob Lowe, and Dennis Miller. The movie's got some great one-liners, countless great scenes, and some in-your-face politically incorrect humor (when BR talks about an environmentalist, the word "Pussy" flashes at the bottom of the screen). The opening scene is truly hilarious. One of the most critical elements of this film however is the performances. The things the main character represents are despicable, so you need to like the character. Having said that, Eckhart is brilliant. He plays the character so convincingly, you half-believe a lot of the stuff he says. The critics were not lying about this film. This is one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

So here it is: 'V for Vendetta' is a sharp, good-looking and solidly crafted, I dunno, action-thriller-sci-fi kinda thing.  It's far from 100% faithful to the comic, but it's closer than I'd anticipated, and manages to par things down into a more cohesive narrative.  This comes at the cost of some ideas, yes, which is too bad, but it's a necessary evil and doesn't come with out some benefits.  Personally, I thought the comic was a bit too meandering and lacked sufficient narrative thrust.  That's bound to be a problem much of the time, considering the format, but it's was worse then it needed be.  Still, some good stuff is lost.  I particularly miss V's affinity for anarchy:  Here they really make no mention of this, with the only vestige remaining being his V symbol, which is, of course, a circled anarchy 'A' turned upside down, minus the line across.  He opposes the current government, yes, but there's no discussion of what he'd replace it with.<br /><br />This was written and produced by the Wachowskis, so yes it's got some Matrix-isms, but fewer then plenty of other films, and the dialogue is rarely, though still occasionally, painful.  The action scenes are generally nicely done; I particularly like the one towards the end, which features many slow motion gouts of blood.  So many action movies are tragically bloodless...  The film looks great, creating a plausible near-future Britain  that manages to be very cold and distant without seeming to far removed from reality.  Performances are solid all around, with particular kudos going to Weaving as V.  He's most notable for the fact that his character is simply believable and not utterly ridiculous.  It would've been very easy for him to come across as such.  Portman is acceptable as Evey, and while the performance is hardly stunning there's really nothing wrong with it. (Just further proof of what a godawful writer/director George Lucas is...)  The rest of the cast are character actor types, and they're all fine.  Interestingly enough, Stephen Rea's Finch, the man who is heading the investigation of V and discovers dangerous governmental secrets in the process, is the major point of identification for the audience. (Or, he was for me.)  I liked him, so it worked, I guess.  Also, I think it's neat that this movie is filled with ugly people, all creased and lumpy and old and with bad teeth.  (Though the one major female character is still very attractive, prior to her hair being cut off, anyway.)  That just happens so rarely.<br /><br />The film perhaps dragged slightly in the final acts, but only briefly.  It's also hurt by a slightly underwhelming and perhaps overly happy conclusion, but how do you finish a story like this anyway?  The ending in the comic wasn't utterly satisfactory either, so while it's different it's a fairly lateral move.<br /><br />The controversy surrouding this film is fairly stupid.  Yes, it's Anti-Bush.  I've encountered anti-Bush sentiments before, however, so I'm not particularly shocked or impressed.  Yeah, the protagonist is a 'terrorist', but that just proves how vague and variable language is.  He blows up a couple of empty buildings and kills some people who wronged him personally all while attacking a government that is legitmately evil and managing to avoid injuring the innocent almost entirely.  In short, he's no more subersive thean a million other film heroes, and less so then plenty.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  An entertaining, sometimes enthralling film.  It's not as smart or deep as it thinks it is, or as some will tell you, but it's smarter than most major films, I suppose, and is always watchable, which is what really matters.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

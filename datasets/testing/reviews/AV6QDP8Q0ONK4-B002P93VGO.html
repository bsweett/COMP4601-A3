<meta name="summary" content="FUN WATCH"></head><body><p>The film starts in 1845 and by the time the credits is over, it is up to date. Wolverine and his brother are recruited to fight in a special mutant force. The mutants are never introduced. There is an assumption you know these characters from previous movies or comics. I would not recommend this film as an introduction to X-Men.<br /><br />The special forces are more brutal than what Wolverine wants to be. "This isn't what we signed up for, " he says as he walks out. He becomes a Canadian and lives quietly like as a lumber jack. His brother is on a rampage...and Wolverine's life becomes disrupted. He must once again fight, only this time he is stronger and is more of a killer.<br /><br />The movie ties in nicely with the other 4 X-Men movies, which should be viewed to get an overall picture, which is difficult to obtain in this film alone. The acting was sufficient. Good CG, super action and fighting. It has plot twists, so pay attention. The movie sprinkles in the right amount of humor, drama, and truisms into the dialouge to make it a fun watch.</p></body></html>

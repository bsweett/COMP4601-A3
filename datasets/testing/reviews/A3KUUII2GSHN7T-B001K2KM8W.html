Anyone, including main protagonists, are a possible death candidates by the time the film ends.<br /><br />#2. At least half the characters will die by the time the film ends.<br /><br />#3. The story will be so remarkable that it will linger with you for days.<br /><br />In Pan's Labyrinth, we see del Toro using the same conventional (for him, not for others) format that he used in The Devil's Backbone. Great isolated ambience; plenty of violence; and a plot so delightful (with cinematography that makes you feel like you're in another realm) that it borders on genius.<br /><br />As for plot, we meet a very dreamy Spanish girl named Ofelia who, along with her pregnant mother, travel to a remote mill where Spanish troops (then working with the Axis powers to make a "clean Spain" in 1944) are under the command of Ofelia's new stepfather, Captain Vidal. Vidal is, as it turns out, like del Toro's other infamous villain, Jacinto from The Devil's Backbone, in that he possesses neither the ability to feel or deliver compassion. Vidal's two main aspirations are #1. to rid the surrounding woodlands of the rebels who are working with the allied powers and #2. to make sure his son is born safely, even at the expense of his wife, Ofelia's mother.<br /><br />And then there is the Labyrinth. Much has been said about the lack of time spent within the Labyrinth but let me admit one truth: enough time is spent there for the viewer to imagine what else might lurk there, and that is what makes this story truly unique. In other fantasy films, it seems that too much time is spent in the alternate world (David Bowie's Labyrinth and The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe both come to mind) and the viewer sometimes can become numb to any scenic trickery or imagination the director might try to instill. In del Toro's vision, we get just enough to know this is a new place, distant from any that we'd read about before. We get a few glimpses of the beauty of horror that reside in the "Kingdom beneath the ground", like a horrifying creature who enjoys sucking the brains from small infants, and believe me, it's enough to leave you talking with friends after the final scene concludes.<br /><br />A very worthwhile film that I highly recommend. It should come without warning that the film possesses much gore, considering it's R-Rated label. Most of the violence, however, is within the world of men (some very World War 2 scenes that you might come to expect in a film like Saving Private Ryan).</p></body></html>

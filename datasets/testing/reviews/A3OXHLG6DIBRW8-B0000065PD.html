<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie That Launched A Great Series - Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>"Stargate" is one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies and this release is well worth having. The picture quality is not quite as good as hoped, but it is certainly more than acceptable.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me. The story centers around Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist who's "crackpot" ideas have isolated him from his academic peers, and Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a very troubled Special Forces Colonel, as they unravel the mystery of the Stargate and deal with hostile aliens (later known as the Gould). Interestingly, several of the of the actors who appear in the movie also show up in the SG-1 series, but not Spader or Russell.<br /><br />This is very good Sci-Fi and should be watched if you are planning on seeing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBNHQ">Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection</a> or the spin-off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018SLGG0">Stargate Atlantis Seasons 1-4</a>.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

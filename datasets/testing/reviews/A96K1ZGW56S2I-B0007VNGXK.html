Then I saw some of the previews and my interest was piqued. After talking with some friends who had seen the film, I decided I really wanted to see this movie. I was not disappointed.<p>HELLBOY begins in 1944 Scotland. Hitler has been organizing a paranormal team for sometime, led by the infamous Russian Zarist advisor, Rasputin. President Roosevelt has dispatched a team to stop the evil scum before they release the dark powers from another realm. The Americans succeed in thwarting the Nazis' plan and Rasputin is sucked into the nether regions. However, before the victory, something from the great beyond came through the portal. That something turns out to be a little red demon with a huge stone fist. The Americans are entranced by the creature and name him Hellboy. Hellboy is adopted and raised by Professor Trevor Bloom (John Hurt) and the two become prominent, but hidden members of the secret paranormal branch of the FBI. Years later Rasputin is resurrected and it's up to Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Professor Bloom, Agent John Myers, and their staff to rid the world of the Rasputin menance.<p>Ron Perlman portrays Hellboy and he's embodies the character just as good, if not better than Tobey Maguire as Spiderman or Christopher Reeves as Superman. I don't think there is any other actor alive who could have captured the nuances of Hellboy so well. Heck, I'll go so far as to say that if Hollywood ever really seriously considered acting nominations for action/sci-fi pictures (they should consider all films, but they don't), Perlman would have one in the bag. The other supporting actors do a good job, too, but besides Perlman I especially enjoyed the performance of John Hurt, he's one of the most underrated character actors of our time.<p>The action in HELLBOY is typical of a comic book flick and some might hold that against the movie. Still, it is a comic book flick and for that, it's pretty good stuff. There is some fairly witty and original dialogue in the script and the direction of Guillermo del Toro holds everything in place. There are a few words of foul language here and there, but nothing that is out of place.<p>In fact, my only complaint about the film is that the villans are completely underdeveloped.  Most of the good guys have some sort of character development during the screen time (though Abe Sapien doesn't get a whole lot). However, the bad guys; and especially Rasputin, don't get any development at all. This is a little disappointing because Rasputin is such an interesting character and the film could have been even better with just a little more character development upon him. Other than that, though, HELLBOY is one rip-roaring good time.</p></body></html>

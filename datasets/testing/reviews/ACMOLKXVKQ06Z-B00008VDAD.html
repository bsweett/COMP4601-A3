This movie has an all star cast also, and I must say that each cast actor gives a wonderful  performance.<p>This is Universal's first Collectors Edition Disc and it  truly is filled with a lot of stuff. A behind the scenes documentary really  shows how the film was made, this is a must have for anyone who owns a DVD  player!<p>This is a must have.<p>(this is my review from DVD empire)</p></body></html>

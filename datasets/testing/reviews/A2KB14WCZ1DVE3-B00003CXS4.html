<meta name="summary" content="Faux Tarantino develops it's own identity"></head><body><p>I was irritated with the first half hour or so of this movie, as it looked like yet another attempt to rip-off Quentin Tarantino.  This is not always bad, since it would be nice if Tarantino released a movie once in awhile.  But this one started off to me as a blatant imitation, with it's low-life gangsters with fancy nicknames spouting off intricate dialog.  And that's when you can understand a word they are saying, especially Brad Pitt.<p>But once the plot gets established and the cast is able to gel, I enjoyed watching it, and was wondering how certain situations were going to be resolved.  The movie is still Tarantino-ish, in that every character is a crook.  The two major capers here involve the theft of a diamond that could choke a buffalo.  The people interested in this rock are also involved in an underground fight game, ironically involving Brad Pitt, who still has his physique from the orgininal "Fight Game".<p>Now the fights themselves are an interesting situation.  They seem to be popular, and of course have a lot of betting action on them.  But they all also seem to be fixed, which you would think would keep serious bettors away once the word gets out.  But when the fix doesn't always work, then those putting money on it would have to be betting if the fix was "legit" or not.  <p>Which is why it gets interesting after awhile.  Brad Pitt enters the fight game after pulling a scam to sell a mobile home to some of the fight flunkies, one of which is a star fighter.  When the scam is discovered, the fighter takes on Pitt, and Pitt immediately cleans the guy's clock. <p> Faced with needing a fighter or literally getting fed to pigs ala "Hannibal", they recruit Pitt to take his place, under the condition that he has to take a dive in the fourth round.  When Pitt's ego/stupidity results in another easy win, it sinks the surrounding mob guys into further pig doo doo.  <p>I am not giving anything away here because the setup of the movie is that for the NEXT fight, Pitt is instructed to dump again.  Whether he does or not I will leave to your viewing, as they leave it unclear until the very end whether Pitt is going to play ball this time or not, and what will be the aftermath depending on that decision.  I thought all of this was very well handled.  <p>Throughout all of this is intertwined the caper of "diamond, diamond, who's got the diamond".  This all involves Benicio del Toro as the guy unfortunate enough to have it in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist, a psycopathic Russian to whom the handcuffs are not a barrier, Dennis Farina who comes in from America, and three bumbling characters who don't seem to know what to do with it when they have it.  If one considers this all fun, then this is one fun movie.</p></body></html>

The group was planning on taking out the White House in a series of terroist attacks that befalled our nation on September 11th. Paul Greengrass tries not to make the film political in anyway. He doesn't bash anyone. He showcases the people that sacrificed their live to save other people. It is a truly outstanding film that had me in tears when I was done watching it. It was a emotional masterpice that held onto you, and didn't let you go to till the end, although you knew what was going to happen, you still wanted the people to live. I respect Paul Greengrass for taking the victims story and showcasing it in the film.</p></body></html>

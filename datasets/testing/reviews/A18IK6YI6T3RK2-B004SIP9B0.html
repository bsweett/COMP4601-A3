As for the movie..I enjoyed it, it had a nice pace and the performances, particularly Cromwell as the neanderthal Phillip and the actor who played Tony Blair, but it is Mirren who elevates this movie, she is reviting.  I appreciated the way the director used real stock footage along with newly shot stage pieces; very well done.  If there is one off note performance it was the simpering, pathetic Charles, I just dont see him as being such a dolt.  The real Charles has bucked his mother in the past, and is passionate to a fault on subjects close to his heart, like the environment and modern architecture, the way he is portrayed here, is a cowering wimp, whining and hand wringing, I just did not see that during the time of Diana's death, I thought Charles showed dignity and respectful deferance to his mother, afterall, she is the Queen, not some simpering fool, who is afraid of his mother.  Anyway, all and all, good film..great lead performance: very well earned Acadamy Award, if for the stag sceen alone.</p></body></html>

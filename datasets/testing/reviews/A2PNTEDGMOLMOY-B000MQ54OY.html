<meta name="summary" content="Visually stunning musical tale for more grown-up kids"></head><body><p>George Miller's animated film, "Happy Feet," is a visual wonder and accomplishes the same feat as Baz Luhrman's "Moulin Rouge," by deftly weaving popular songs into the plot of the movie.  But please note, the title and the fact that the movie features beyond-cute penguins belie the fact that this is a more grown-up cartoon that earns its PG rating - this is not G-rated family fare for kiddies of all ages.<br /><br />"HF" focuses on emperor penguins, and Miller pays an obvious tribute to "March of the Penguins" in the opening scenes.  Memphis (Hugh Jackman) falls in love with Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) and they have an egg.  Norma Jean then heads off for the fishing grounds, leaving Memphis with the egg through the long cold winter night - a scene that the movie creates with dazzling artistry.  Tragedy nearly strikes when Memphis drops his egg for a few seconds - anyone who has seen "March" knows that a few instants can be fatal.  Memphis is gravely worried that his instant of inattention has cost his family dear.<br /><br />But all appears well when Mumble (Elijah Wood) hatches . . . but then he starts tap-dancing.  Memphis tries to help Mumble hide this odd quirk (penguins are a rigid society), but everything comes clear when Mumble proves that he absolutely cannot sing.  This is a big sin in emperor penguin land, as every emperor penguin has a "heart song," and without it, you can never find a mate.  Mumble can't sing, but he can dance like Savion Glover (who provides the dancing).  Still, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), the best-singing penguin Mumble's age, won't have him because he can't sing, and Mumble is ostracized.<br /><br />What follows is a wild ramble for Mumble.  He encounters dangerous leopard seals and meets new friends, some Latino penguins who aren't so hung-up on singing.  Ultimately, Mumble learns that the fishing problems plaguing the penguins (the fish are mysteriously disappearing) are not blamed on the penguins' lack of devotion to their ways, but the depredations of aliens (i.e., man).  So what begins as a musical romp turns into a powerful environmental message-film.<br /><br />And powerful it is.  I first saw "HF" with my four-year old daughter in the Omnimax format, and many adults were shedding tears by the end of the movie.  This is serious stuff, but I have to admit that my daughter was also riveted by the movie despite its near two-hour length.<br /><br />Look for more mature humor - this is more like "Shrek" than "Toy Story."<br /><br />All in all, "HF" is one of the best animated films to come out in recent years, and that's saying something as we are seeing more and more animated movies than ever before.  It's a little dark for some kids, so you should probably watch it with your kids the first time to make sure that it's OK.  But the good news is that you will enjoy Mumble's journey and probably have some explaining to do with your kids about man's siphoning of the penguin's fish.  An excellent film.</p></body></html>

Her life was about helping every kid she could get a home and a chance at a better life. There were four kids she just couldn't find a home for; she gave them hers so they would grow up with some amount of love and positive direction in their lives even if the world outside thought they were nothing but trash. In return they loved her for it.<br /><br />Four Brothers opens with Evelyn providing some of her loving direction to a young boy who was stealing candy from a corner store. After he leaves she goes about her shopping. A few minutes later she hears two men come in and rob the place. It is a very intense scene where she ducks behind a shelving unit and listens to the interaction between a Black masked man and the young Indian clerk. The man in the mask makes a poignant statement about how a brother can't make no living from the country his in and shoots the clerk. Evelyn's squeal of shock alert to her presence and they find and kill her. Big mistake.<br /><br />Evelyn's four boys return home for her funeral, tie up affairs associated with a death and pick up where they left off as brothers. The four men; two black, two white and no blood relation are obviously brothers. In their neighbourhood they are known as the Mercer brothers: Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah, and Jack. As they begin to look into their mother's death they realize there's a little more to the story than a simple corner store robbery. The more they look the angrier they get and the angrier they get the more heads rolls. The police and the local crime boss are not going to keep them from their task of finding out the truth behind their mother's death.<br /><br />The movie had a slow start but once the action starts it doesn't stop. Four Brothers has great cinematography, action, acting and story. It was not predictable at all. Just when I thought I knew who was behind everything there's an exciting twist. I loved all four actors playing the brothers and am looking forward to seeing it again. Some of the features include deleted scenes, a featurette on the brothers and one on a major snow storm stunt drive.</p></body></html>

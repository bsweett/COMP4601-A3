<meta name="summary" content="Baseball - It's a Business..."></head><body><p>Let me start by saying I'm a big baseball fan and I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his performance as Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane. I also think Jonah Hill is superb and earns his best supporting actor nomination as made-up Yale-educated baseball statistician "Peter Brand". It is worth noting that it is Brand's real-life ideas, embodied by on-field application of real-life statistician Bill James' Sabermetrics, that make up the heart and soul of "Moneyball" - both the film and the idea.<br /><br />Beane's A's have had some success. In 2001 with a roster that cost a third of the high-ballin' Yankees the A's take the mighty Yanks down to the last game of the playoffs prior to losing, then losing stars Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen to teams that can afford their now high-price salaries. (From an even playing field standpoint, Major League Baseball is still miles behind any American ideal of "fairness".) Beane is "rewarded" with the task of rebuilding the A's with the available funds to attract... no one.<br /><br />He goes to another organization to talk a trade and notices Brand in the corner whispering in the ear of a rival general manager. Beane, who was a professional player himself, knows that Jonah Hill doesn't look like anyone's idea of a sports guy. He tracks him down after the meeting and asks why the Indian's General Manager listens to him.<br /><br />And thus is presented the whole idea of Moneyball: although home runs and batting averages are flashy and show up on Sportscenter highlights, the bottom line in baseball is wins. A walk, while not ostentatious, is pretty much exactly as valuable as a single, and players with good on-base percentages (judiciously mixing walks in with swings of the bat) are as valuable as players with a good batting average.<br /><br />Beane buys into the idea and puts all his eggs into the Moneyball basket, upsetting pretty much everyone else in the organization.  He seems to have nothing to lose - his owner isn't going to provide one of those multi-million dollar contracts, so Beane and Brand have to find bargain players.<br /><br />The drama comes in watching Beane coax and cajole the rest of the A's organization into buying the concept. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays field manager Art Howe, who frankly tells Beane that he thinks the whole experiment is going to get him fired. (My recollection of the real Howe is a thin, gaunt man physically almost completely dissimilar from the moon-faced Hoffman, but hey, it's a movie.)<br /><br />The problem I have with the film is the manner in which they reduce the national pastime, the hope and dream of millions of boys and girls (and boys and girls at heart) to a cold, statistical business. I don't know the real Billy Beane. I suspect that they model many of his film idiosyncrasies on real life, such as the fact that he doesn't travel with the team or even go out to the field to watch the games. For the little boy in me this makes as much sense as changing the end of Willy Wonka to put the Chocolate Factory away in the closet and watch it occasionally on television.<br /><br />As a "renegade businessman upsetting the apple-cart" story, Moneyball works. After all, the screenplay is by that double-dog genius of screenwriters, Aaron Sorkin. As a baseball movie - it's not even as fun as watching batting practice.</p></body></html>

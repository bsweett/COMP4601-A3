Well, those nerds can eat their words now because Ratner's X-Men is so fantastic that it doesn't even compare to Singer's films. Singer did a pretty good job. But Ratner's film IS X-Men. He presents these characters the way they were always meant to be. What's great about this film? Story, acting, action, special effects, you name it. Ratner gets it done right. I actually teared up in a scene near the end. This movie is just perfect.<br /><br />I heard this will be the last X-Men film. That's a shame because this franchise is better than ever.</p></body></html>

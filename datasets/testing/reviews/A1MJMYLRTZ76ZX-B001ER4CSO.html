<meta name="summary" content="Great special effects & action"></head><body><p>PLease note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't speak to the quality of the DVD transfer. But I did want to make a few comments about the movie.<br /><br />I basically watch movies like this for the special effects and the action, not expecting anything much in the way a convincing story, well developed characters, or even good acting. That way I avoid the anguished indignation of the many sci fi or fantasy fans when the sequel fails to live up to their overblown expectations. After all, it's sci fi/fantasy, what did they expect? Last Tango in Paris or Gone with the Wind?<br /><br />Of course, the counter-argument is the movie, Bladerunner, which has everything, but then Bladerunner was based on the Philip K. Dick novel, and Dick was a half-wacked, dyspeptic but brilliant sci-fi writer who was in and out of psychiatric care or even mental hospitals much of his life. Maybe there's a lesson there somewhere when it comes to finding good ideas and move scripts.<br /><br />But anyway, all that aside, I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps because I didn't see the original Hellboy which everyone here is unfavorably comparing this sequel to. But this movie has some of the best action, special effects, spectacular background sets, and fight sequences of any recent super hero movie. The fight between Hellboy and the Golden Army soldiers, who can reassemble themselves sort of like animated Leggos, is cool. The final fight scene in the clockwork-like underground cave is ingenious and suspenseful, and the super kung-fu elf bad guy is like something out of Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon.<br /><br />Overall a pretty exciting action flick that is sort of like Tolkien's Middle Earth meets Lost in Space, since there are some campy sci-fi elements too. I give it a solid 4.5 stars just for its adrenalin pumping action and special effects. Just ignore the sappy love affair and sit back and watch the action. Plus when the ectoplasmic being in the cool looking space suit tells their CIA-clone boss he can "**** my ectoplasmic schwanstucker" at the end of the movie I just about fell out of my chair.</p></body></html>

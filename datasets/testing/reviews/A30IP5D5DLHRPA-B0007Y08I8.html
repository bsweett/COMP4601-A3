<meta name="summary" content="A Political Satire of Offensive/Hilarious Proportions"></head><body><p>Anyone that watches South Park know that Trey Stone and Matt Parker like to make adult political satires based on pop culture and contemporary politics with a no-holds-bar style of bashing.  Team America: World Police is not any different.<br /><br />In Team America, the patriotic soldiers of freedom (Namely, Team America) are depicted at reckless, overreacting, over-destructive soldiers despite their good intentions of protecting people.  In the first scene, they blow up Paris while trying to stop four terrorists, later they do the same in Cairo.  Kim Jong Il and the terrorists are portrayed in stereotypical fashion of Middle Eastern/Islamic males with turbans on their heads, spouting off idiotic sounding jibberish ("Durka, Durka!  Muhammed Jihad!!").  Kim Jong Il is quite comical in his role as he kills Hans Blix, hosts a peace rally and even breaks into song at one point.  The Hollywood celebs are depicted as... well, wusses.  People, that prefer to blame those who fight terrorism, rather than the terrorists themselves and even band together with Kim Jong Il to stop Team America.<br /><br />Now believe it or not, but this all serves a purpose to explain a sort of "balance" in the world between those who fight terrorism, those who sue for peace and those who oppose peace.  It's rather interesting, but this is a review, not a political commentary.<br /><br />Now politics aside, this movie is not for anyone under 17.  The jokes are rather crude, involving drunken vomiting, an explicit sex scene, blown up bodies, animals eating corpses, shark attack... all involving puppets.  Which makes it rather humorous in some areas, especially with the "Kung fu" fight scenes.  The puppet works is done extremely well in some scenss, but horribly done in others, which is supposed to make it funny.<br /><br />Team America was extremely funny when I first saw it in theatres.  I hit the floor laughing when Michael Moore... well, you'll just have to see.  However, the 2nd time around, it wasn't all that funny, especially after the tsunami incident in Asia.  It's mostly shock humor that loses it's taste to the general audience after the first showing.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this movie emensely and I recomend it to anyone that desires to see another side of the political spectrum.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this movie will probably offend you no matter what political idealogy you follow.  But do not let that ruin the experience.</p></body></html>

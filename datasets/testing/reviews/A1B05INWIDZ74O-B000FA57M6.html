<meta name="summary" content="Action with a little suspense"></head><body><p>I never played the game, but watching this movie made me think this is how the game must look like on the screen. If you like The Movie Alien, you might like this. Some of the same feel to it. Moments of on the edge of your seat suspense before all out action. Seemed more like a made for TV movie or direct video. But it is still worth watching. If you are not a big fan of the game...rent it. I borrowed it from the library.</p></body></html>

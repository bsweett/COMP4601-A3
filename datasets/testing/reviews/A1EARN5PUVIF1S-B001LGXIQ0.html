<meta name="summary" content="Get Smart -- and Watch the Original Series Instead"></head><body><p>Why does Hollywood persist in producing horrendous remakes of classic TV series?  Because they figure that these efforts are pre-sold commodities, I guess.<br /><br />So here is another in a continuing roster of dreadful films guaranteed to make fans of the original series wince in pain (others that come to mind include "Bewitched," "The Avengers," and "Rocky and Bullwinkle," to name just three).<br /><br />If you're going to remake a beloved TV series, then for heaven's sake, make it true to the things that people loved best about the show.  For some reason, the hacks who make these movies think that they can improve on the originals, and nine times out of ten, they can't.<br /><br />The first problem here is Maxwell Smart himself, as played by Steve Carell.  To be fair, Carell had giant shoephones to fill, those of Don Adams, who was pretty much born to play Smart on TV (and before Smart, an identical Detective character, named Glick if memory serves me, on the Bill Dana show).<br /><br />Smart is a classic comic character because, like Inspector Clouseau, he has absolute confidence in his abilities, which are continually shown to be all but nonexistent.  The huge gap between his supreme confidence and his staggering ineptitude produces the comedy.  In this movie, however, Smart is shown to be a Control analyst suffering from doubt and a midlife crisis.  That stance is just wrong for the character.<br /><br />Similarly, as blind as TV Smart was to his incompetence, he was equally blind to his source of greatest good fortune -- the devotion to him shown by the beautiful and extremely competent Agent 99, who prevails as often as he fails.<br /><br />In the show, 99's adoration was sweet if misguided.  Here, 99, as played by Anne Hathaway, is shown to be quite put off by Smart's lack of field experience, and so their relationship starts off brittle and cold, and not at all credible when the couple do warm up by film's end.<br /><br />As for the humor of the movie, it mostly consists of sadistic sight gags like memos being stapled to people's foreheads or Max hurting himself with a tricked-out professional-strength Swiss Army Knife.  What little wit shines through comes from quotes of the famous catch phrases of the series ("Missed it by that much", "Would you believe", and the like.)<br /><br />In place of the original's sharp characterizations and humor, we get pretty photography of Moscow and one big-budget (but not very funny) chase scene.  Plus the luscious Anne Hathaway, who deserves much better fare than this.  The only extra on the DVD is a handful of alternate scenes; the ones included in the theatrical release were so painful, I opted not to endure those as well.<br /><br />So if you haven't ever seen "Get Smart" on TV, by all means check out the first season of that riotous spy spoof instead.  If you have, then do yourself a favor and steer clear of this dog (and I don't mean Agent Fang).</p></body></html>

Due to the classic nature of the first couple Superman films there was high expectations set for Superman Returns. An important note about this installment is that it is actually the fifth and final installment in the original Superman film series and serves as a sequel to Superman and Superman II. This film ignores the events of Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. The basic premise is that Superman (Brandon Routh)  was gone for 5 years of soul searching and now he is back. At the same time the evil mastermind Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is also back and plotting to take over the entire world. All the rest of the key characters are here as well and the film actually makes a successful transition from the original second installment of the series. Overall it is a great action packed return to form for the Man of Steel. A new character is also introduced in Superman Returns. As you watch the film you will find out who it this individual is and you may find the connection quite interesting.</p></body></html>

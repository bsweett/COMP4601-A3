<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first movie.. improves on the comic legend"></head><body><p>I thought this was a better story than the first. Without the Wolverine character this would be another super hero movie. I can see why there are plans to make Wolvie star in his own film. Hugh Jackman carries the story. <p>Well, on to my review....with the mutant registration act the government believes the X-Men pose a threat to society.  It has a great battle scene when the dark forces of Washington D.C. decide to raid the school of mutants. Wolvie has a few more beserker rages in this one but they are not the gory mess I'd thought they might portray. This film is just like a Chris Clearmont scripted X-Men saga. And I have to wonder why the producers didn't get him involved in the story process. <p>If it wasn't for writers like Chris Clearmont... and lets not forget artists Jim Cockrum and John Byrne; the X-Men would have never got off the ground in the mid seventies.</p></body></html>

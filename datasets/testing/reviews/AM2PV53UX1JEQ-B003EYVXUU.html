<meta name="summary" content="EMOTIONAL HORROR"></head><body><p>The most memorable horror movies of all time are infused with real emotion - the gripping terror of a mother watching her child descend into monstrosity (The Exorcist); the growing fear of a beautiful young wife that she is surrounded by evil (Rosemary's Baby); the devasting loneliness, and ultimate revenge, of a sad high school wallflower (Carrie).  Let Me In is the first honestly terrific horror movie to come along since these classics.  The spooky beauty of this film - from its artfully shot locations, its lush musical score, to its mesmerizing performances - is only one of its many assets.  Most importantly, Let Me In tells an original story and draws you in to the world of two children, both of whom must deal with extraordinary pain and alienation.  The potent mix of spine-shivering terror and lump in your throat works magic in this, a most unlikely entry into the vampire catalog; you won't soon forget Abby once you've let her in.</p></body></html>

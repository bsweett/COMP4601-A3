<meta name="summary" content="Classic Adaptation of a Classic Novel"></head><body><p>Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent novel, and this is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent adaptation. Almost everything about this film is flawless. From the script and the acting, to the cinematography to the music, it deserves its status as a classic monumental film. There's no doubt that Gregory Peck reveals his timeless acting abilities as Atticus Finch. It's a stunning performance, and this performance alone will never become extinct in the legacies of motion pictures. Like the book, this film teaches a very important lesson on racism old and new. Some changes had been made, but I hope readers won't mind, since this IS a film adaptation.<br /><br />To Kill A Mockingbird stands on its own as a classic film. Mixed with dark humor and very fierce drama, this is a film that will never be lost in the shadows.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></body></html>

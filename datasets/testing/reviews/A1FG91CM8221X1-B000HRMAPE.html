<meta name="summary" content="By far the best of the Mission: Impossible franchise."></head><body><p>J.J. Abrams' "Mission: Impossible III" is vastly superior to the first two films in this franchise. It is the only one of the three that gives us what we wanted in the first place: a taut, thrill-a-minute adventure that resembles a super-big-budget episode of the original series, and that makes us care just enough about the characters that we feel just enough emotion about their fates. It doesn't turn original series characters into traitor-villains to validate Tom Cruise's claim to the franchise, as M:I One did; it doesn't sacrifice plot coherence to adrenaline rush and the worship of Tom Cruise, as M:I Two did. Cruise, of course, is still front-and-center, but here he's the first among equals, not the whole show. Whatever you think of his offscreen behavior, he's still a believable, charismatic action hero, and never more so than here. Abrams showcases Cruise without deifying him; himself the creator of tense, breathtaking TV series such as "Alias" and "Lost," Abrams knows how to pace a movie like this, and how to shoot action scenes for maximum impact. He also chooses his casts superbly; the supporting players may not have a lot to do here, but they do it very well. Philip Seymour Hoffman, possibly the best American actor currently in film, oozes fishbelly slime as the ruthless Owen Davian, arms dealer and nemesis to Cruise's Ethan Hunt. There is also notably good work from the returning Ving Rhames as Cruise's best buddy, and from Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup as IMF higher-ups who may or may not have their own agendas. And, of course, there are death-defying stunts, shootouts and explosions galore. If you're looking for action, M:I Three has it.</p></body></html>

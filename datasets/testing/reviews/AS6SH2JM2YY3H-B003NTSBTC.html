<meta name="summary" content="A place of last resort..."></head><body><p>When does society place you when you've committed a terrible crime, are still violent, and suffer from mental instability as well?<br /><br />Shutter Island, an old Civil War prison.<br /><br />Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is sent to Shutter Island to investigate the escape of a murderer.  But he learns that the prison facility is as escape-proof as can be.  The investigation gets deeper and darker as the hours progress, and the flashbacks of WWII soldier Daniels liberating a concentration camp adds to the forbidding sense that something is going to happen (by the way, the title sounds too much like "Shudder Island").  Staff psychiatrists played by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow add to the gloomy nature of the film.  Kingsley is a great Gandhi, but he can be spooky.  Max von Sydow is usually spooky.<br /><br /> Then the tale takes a turn.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I just have to admit that  any potential "staging" in the plot was probably impossible, as were the conditions in Cell Block C.<br /><br />I was hoping for more.</p></body></html>

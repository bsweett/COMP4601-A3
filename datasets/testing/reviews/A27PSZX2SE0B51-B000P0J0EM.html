<meta name="summary" content="A quarter mile too long"></head><body><p>When we say that a movie is too long, we mean one of two things:<p>It is so inept and boring, that time appears to slow down while we're watching it, making it seem too long.<p>Or<p>The filmmaker's had some good material to work with, but not enough to justify the extended length.<p>"The Green Mile" falls smack dab in the middle of category number two.  So, how could it have been shortened, and thus made better?<p>My first suggestion is to get rid of the old people.  Or, tidy up their scenes.  I understand the need for this hackneyed framing device (it becomes clear in the end), but somewhere between concept and execution, the idea falls on hard times.  Firstly, the old people they cast are horrible actors.  It appears that the crew set up shop in a nursing home one afternoon, handed out copies of the script, and rolled film.  Every emotion is artificially heightened, every line reading is stilted, and no one comes across as believable.  Second, I don't think the prologue / epilogue adds anything to the film, except to give the filmmakers an opportunity to once again spell out their message, in case one or two members of the audience missed it the first forty times.  Okay, so we edit out the old people scenes, and that cuts off, what, fifteen minutes of screen time.<p>Next, we have way too many executions.  They're all done well, bringing the right amount of pathos to the proceedings, without ever being manipulative (well, one is, but it kind of had to be to make its point).  But overkill (pun intended) is still overkill.  We have three executions, shown in their entirety, plus a couple of dry run trial executions (I hate being the one recommending Harry Dean Stanton should wind up on the cutting room floor, but here we are).  I say, show the bare bones only of the first one, show bits and pieces of the trial runs, show only the important bits of the second one (this should be obvious), and lay it all on the line for the third one.  That should cut another ten or so minutes from the film.<p>There's a scene where Tom Hank' Paul Edgecomb goes to visit Gary Sinise, the lawyer who represented John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).  It does nothing to further the story, or Paul's perceptions of Coffey, and can be exorcised neatly.  Plus, it tries to fuel the fires of an issue (racism) that until this point hadn't been brought up, and, given the film's tone, really didn't need to be brought up so explicitly by a secondary character.  We can see that racism is a factor without Sinise's blatant pejorative.  Okay, so that's another five minutes lost.<p>Finally, there are two characters here who get way too much screen time, much of it redundant.  Doug Hutchinson's Percy is a cowardly little skunk.  We get that information from his first couple scenes.  Then we get it over and over again.  I'd have him in the background, only emerging for his confrontations with Michael Jeter's Del (and then for Del's execution).  Hutchinson does a fine job with the role (you will hate Hate HATE Percy), but he was too big a part.  Sam Rockwell, as Wild Bill, a newly arrived inmate, also serves a purpose, but to less a degree than his screen time would justify.  Rockwell, in some scenes, is allowed to go off for pages and pages of rambling and nonsensical dialogue.  He's a whacked out hard case.  We get it.  Move on to the story, please.  Okay, that should trim another ten minutes or so.<p>Which means we have a nice, lean two hour and twenty minute film.  Probably still too long given the story they're telling, but not unbearable by any means.<p>Okay, so why does "The Green Mile" fall into category two instead of the dreaded category one?  For a film that feels so much like a stage play (the minimalist sets, unlike the realistic and tarnished prison from "The Shawshank Redemption", felt too clean and too pure to represent anything from the real world) it's got to be about the actors.  Hanks, of course, is just solid.  Paul is not a hero by any means, and, as most have said, he probably makes the wrong choice in the end.  But it was his choice to make, and Hanks ably shows the angst it took to make that choice.  Plus, he gets to play pain and indignity, as Paul has a wicked bladder infection throughout the film's first third.<p>Paul's men, played by David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn are all excellent.  Morse is every bit Hanks' equal in the tough scenes the two have together.  Pepper is good at playing the wide-eyed innocent, just starting out on the job, unaware of the horrors he's about to see.  And DeMunn is mainly about quiet dignity, and in the end, confusion as to what the right thing to do would be.<p>Michael Clarke Duncan, as John Coffey, did an excellent job, although for the most part he was nearly unintelligible.  Sure, that's the character (uneducated, talking in backwoods slang), but between the mumbled dialogue, and the 1930s jargon, I had a tough time figuring out what he had to say.  To remedy this, I recommend turning on the DVD's subtitles.  This fixes one problem, and brings about another.  Even though Coffey is supposed to be touched by God, his speeches were way too poetic for a man of his education.  And other times, he lacks any poetry in his speech at all.  He's an inconsistently written character.  Credit should go to Duncan, who does a fine, charismatic job bringing this hulking but innocent man to life.<p>While not nearly as good as Frank Darabont's last Stephen King-in-a-prison adaptation, "The Green Mile", while tremendously flawed, has just enough going for it to make it worth seeing.</p></body></html>

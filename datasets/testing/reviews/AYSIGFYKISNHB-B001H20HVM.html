<meta name="summary" content="Oh Yes...There Will Be Blood. Jigsaw Returns"></head><body><p>After escaping after the 1st Saw, Jigsaw returns to play a new game. After the sucess of Saw, a sequel was bound to be made. Leigh Whannell returns to write the sequel, that's what made this sequel so good.<br /><br />Detective Eric Matthews (Whalberg) and Detective Kerry (Meyer) have finally found John aka Jigsaw (Bell). They were about to aresst him, but Jigsaw is holding Eric's son Daniel (Knudsen) and others in a abandoned house. Each victim is exposed to a deadly poisoness gas that will kill them in hours. Now, they all have to work together to find the antidode.<br /><br />Shawnee Smith returns as Amanda, now she has to replay Jigsaw's game in order to survive.<br /><br />To me, this sequel is better than the 1st film, and another cool ending this film has. If you haven't seen Saw 2 yet, go check it out. Check it out before Saw 3 comes out this October.</p></body></html>

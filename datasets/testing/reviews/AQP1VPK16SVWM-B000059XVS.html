<meta name="summary" content="5 Star film, 3 Star treatment on the Superbit edition"></head><body><p>One of David Lean's finest films, Lawrence of Arabia finally looks pretty good on DVD. You'll notice I said pretty good not exceptional or excellent or even outstanding. Why is that? Edge enhancement has become an issue with many DVDs. With this transfer it's no exception. There is an excessive amount of halos and a shimmering like effect that you see with edge enhancement. This is distracting for many folks.<p>Sometimes Columbia gets it right and sometimes they get it wrong. There have been a couple of Superbit DVDs that are outstanding and have minimal or no edge enhancement visible. While restoration expert Robert Harris is to be applauded for his efforts in improving this transfer, it appears that a number of short cuts were taken (probably not by Harris although if it was one has to question why). To give this edition of Lawrence its due, this is probably the sharpest, most vivid transfer I've seen of Lawrence and it bests the Laserdisc edition as well. Considering the magic that Robert Harris worked (a decade plus after he helped restore it)with the original material and the nice job of color balancing, adjustments, etc. that was done, it's a pity this isn't closer to perfection.<p>If none of this is valuable to you and you aren't looking to purchase a Superbit Edition but a regular single disc edition, by all means read the review for that item. It's a solid transfer and looks good if you don't notice edge enchancements or issues with how sharp the resolution or how accurate the color might be.<p>No need to recap the plot but I'd like to point out that Peter O'Toole is still stunning in the title role. With a supporting cast consisting of Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Omar Shariff, Alec Guiness and others, that's no small feat. Like the role Michael Rennie played in The Day The Earth Stood Still, O'Toole came to be defined to some extent by this role. It didn't limit his abilities as an actor, however, because the studio system didn't exist to exert its constraints on him as an actor. <p>A couple of other minor complaints; 1) Why didn't Columbia do away with the Intermission. Yes, the music is glorius but why not include the music as the only supplement at the end of the disc? This wouldn't have taken any more disc space than the Intermission does now. Since this is broken up over two discs, the intermission is unnecessary. It's much like the roadshow overture; it's not something that most fans of the film are going to sit through every single time. Again, I would have put the three minute overture as an option vs. having it pasted at the front where you have to fast forward through it every single time.<p>With all the extra money spent on this disc would it have hurt Columbia to include a third disc with special features? A documentary on the original restoration would have been nice as would a documentary on T. E. Lawrence (I'm sure I remember that Biography ran one so it would be available to license). If these Superbit editions are going to be treated as the deluxe edition, why not include some deluxe extras? These are minor points to be sure, but if you're going to pony up for another edition of a film you've already purchased, why not get some extra value beyond the enhanced film?<p>For those that are interested there are two other versions of Lawrence avaiable on DVD. The single disc has the entire film with no extras (that I recall), while the double disc edition does feature many extras that are worthwhile and it has a collectable case, booklet, etc. The former runs about $10.00 less than this edition, while the latter is comparable in cost.</p></body></html>

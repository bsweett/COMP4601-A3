<meta name="summary" content="Disappointed here"></head><body><p>Like many have already pointed out, this one falls short of the first two films, having seen the original years ago, I just today rewatched it & for the first time saw X2 & X3, & felt that X2 was on par with the first film, I never really kept up with the comics, but really did like the second film as a sequel, but I was really disappointed with this third film, as many have pointed out, the themes of the other two seem to get lost here, for instance Cyclops, who is by far a fun character with awesome powers gets shafted in the first 10 minutes, of course I knew why, the actor James Marsedan went with Bryan Singer to do "Superman Returns" which I hate to admit was probably a smart move seeing that X3 fails as a sequel, also Patrick Stewart's Xavier is killed off, which really sucked, imagine Yoda being killed off in "Star Wars" Ep III", then Rebecca Romajn as Mystique is done away with, the only saving grace here is seeing her real nakedness breifly, & the one thing that always irks me is when fashion idiots think they should make over the actors, both Halle Berry & Famke Jansen get unattractive makeovers, & speaking of Jansen, was it necessary to bring her back?, & I won't even get started on Anna Paquin's Roque being shafted here, in the first film she was an integral part of the story, here she is just in the background, at least she didn't get a screwy makeover, only Hugh Jackman & Ian McKellan are the same as before, but they both just didn't seem to be into it this time around, Jackman had just done "Van Helsing" & seemed bored with "Wolverine" & McKellan had just scored with "LOTR" so he looked bored in his role too, also as one reviewer noted, there are shades of "Matrix" & "Terminator", I could go on & on, but clearly this one failed to grab me like the first two did, I call it laziness on the part of the writers & studios!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How about "Oops, Robot", instead?"></head><body><p>Let me put it plainly: this movie gave as much of a hard time as Swordfish and A.I. combined, two of my least favorite movies in recent times. It feels like a waste of a good story and some great acting (Will Smith's) on a poor screenplay where the effects are (sometimes) the only interesting thing in the movie (the reason I don't give it 1 star only). Never mind the product placement which becomes fairly annoying after a few minutes... The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.<br /><br />For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi. I am a fan of the genre, but movies such as Bladerunner and more recently, Minority Report, really do it justice. And I LOVED Alex Proyas' work with "The Crow" and "Dark City", but "I, Robot" instead felt more like "Oops, Robot". Do yourself a favor and skip it altogether.</p></body></html>

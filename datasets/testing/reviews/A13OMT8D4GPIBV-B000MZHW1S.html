<meta name="summary" content="Incredible Action Piece"></head><body><p>Blood Diamond is one of the finest films of the year.  Directed by Edward Zwick (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JRYOP6">Glory (Special Edition, Repackaged)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001JXOVC">The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>).  Featuring a well acted cast that includes Oscar Nominees Leonardo DiCarprio (Best Actor) and Djimon Hounsou (Best Supporting Actor) and also Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly.<br /><br />The movie focuses on the conflict "blood" diamond trade in Africa, and one man trying to get his family back after his home is ravaged.  Leo plays a white African with his own agenda.  Only after a few conditions do they agree to be partners.<br /><br />This is a great film, whether you get the single disc or the two disc edition.  The single disc only features a commentary and trailers, but the two disc edition features a documentary about the conflict diamonds in Sierra Leone.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

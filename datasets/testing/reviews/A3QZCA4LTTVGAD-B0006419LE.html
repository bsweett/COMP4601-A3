<meta name="summary" content="An essential classic of sci-fi cinema"></head><body><p>&quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, tells the story of an astronaut named Taylor (played by Charlton Heston), who lands on a planet where talking apes rule and human beings are mute savages.  Taylor struggles to survive and uncover the secrets of this strange world.<p>POTA is truly one of the seminal classics of sci-fi cinema: it gave birth to a genuine franchise (sequels, TV series, a high profile remake, etc.).  But the film truly stands on its own as a complete and compelling piece of art.  It's a rousing blend of sci-fi adventure and social satire, supported by an intelligent script and superb performances.  It's full of iconic images and unforgettable lines.<p>Every element in the film is crafted with care and intelligence: costume design, sets, etc.  The stunning visuals are perfectly complemented by Jerry Goldsmith's eerie, unearthly score.  All these elements come together to create a world both oddly familiar and truly alien.<p>Heston is perfect as the sarcastic, misanthropic Taylor, who wonders if something better than man exists in the universe.  He has great chemistry with his &quot;simianized&quot; costars; his verbal sparring with Maurice Evans (as imperious orangutan Dr. Zaius) has real bite.  Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter provide the film's warm heart as chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira.<p>POTA is a true classic: one of those films you can watch again and again, savoring every memorable moment.  The film offers memorable perspectives on science, religion, authoritarianism, the nature of humankind, and the quest for truth.  After all these years, POTA still packs a real punch.</p></body></html>

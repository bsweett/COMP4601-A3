The premise is that during the first Gulf War a supposed Iraqi attack on a patrol is staged by Americans. The surviving members of the patrol are carefully programmed to believe that one of their members, the son of a powerful politician, acted heroically to save their lives. That soldier was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and is now being pushed as the vice presidential candidate for the party that will most certainly win the election.<br />  Denzel Washington plays the leader of the patrol and he is having uncontrolled and disturbing flashbacks that contradict the official history. He also encounters another member of the patrol suffering from the same condition. As the story unfolds, it is a deep conspiracy to carefully manufacture a background that will win the vice presidency and then remove the president so that the programmed candidate will assume the presidency.<br /> Because the conspiracy is so deep, it is at times difficult to follow the sequence and you wonder what the truth is. However, the constant of Streep as the Dragon Lady of manipulation keeps the sequence going and provides an anchor. For you understand throughout that she is pure evil and power hungry, willing to destroy her own son in order to acquire political power.</p></body></html>

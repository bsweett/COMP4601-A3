<meta name="summary" content="The Longest Suicide Video"></head><body><p>Herzog is amazing and when he decides to do something real by pulling off another documentary, like his award winning 'My Best Fiend', you just know it is going to be something worth seeing. Here Herzog edits from over 100 hours of video footage the story of Timothy Treadwell's risky, and ultimately deadly, self-sponsored grizzly bear research in the wilderness of the Alaska Peninsula. It must be seen to be believed, could be one of the best films of 2005/2006, and certainly raises a hair or two, including the final moments where the ecentric Treadmill probably filmed himself with his murderer. Just watch this and be amazed at the stunning one on one bear footage never seen in the wild this way before, coupled with the local coroner describing how Timothy recorded himself on camera, telling his girlfriend to run away while screaming as the bear tore his skull open. Shockingly profound and at times seriously touching, this is wholly original and confusingly stunning. You have never seen anything like it before, nor will you again.</p></body></html>

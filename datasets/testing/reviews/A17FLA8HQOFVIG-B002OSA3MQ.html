<meta name="summary" content="Suspense and intrigue with no easy answers"></head><body><p>Adapted from Graham Greene's book which was written with a film in mind, Carol Reed did a masterful job of directing this 1949 film which won Academy Awards for film editing, black and white photography, and directing.  It's a bit of a masterpiece and holds the viewer in a suspended state of suspense, heightening the tensions as it moves swiftly along.<p>Starring Joseph Cotton as Holly Martin, an American who comes to Vienna at the request of an old college chum, Harry Lime, played by Orson Wells, the scene is set for intrigue from the very beginning.  Martins is immediately told that Harry Lime has been killed in an accident and that his funeral is in progress.  The plot thickens as he encounters a British policeman and learns that Harry might not have been such a nice guy after all.  Martin suspects murder and goes about investigating on his own, finding himself attracted to Lime's girlfriend, played by Alida Valli.<p>Orson Wells doesn't appear until more than half the film is over, and only appears in three major scenes.  But these scenes will be remembered forever especially the one where he and Joseph Cotton confront each other on a moving Ferris Wheel. <p>Wells and Cotton are the stars of this film but the there's another star as well. And that's the City of Vienna in all its wartime devastation.  There is real rubble everywhere and the oblique angled shots, distorted wide angles and stark black and white photography create a surreal and bleak landscape.  And then there is the haunting original zither music by Anton Karas, which became a top hit in 1950.<p>I recently read the book by Graham Greene and therefore knew the plot.  In a way this spoiled the suspense for me.  Freed from that however, I was able to concentrate on the details of the directional techniques and the cinematography.  There's no doubt about it.  This film is a winner.</p></body></html>

Once again he wakes up to find himself disoriented and being interrogated by an Air Force officer (Vera Farmiga). It seems that he has a mission and will relive those same 8 min. over again until he completes the objective. However Colter may have objectives of his own. As the story unfolds with Colter and the people he interacts with get closer to both objectives we go along for the ride.<br /><br />As you know there are several movies out there with the same theme is time or the essence of time being allowed to change over again so that you can right your mistakes. This movie of course is one of them. It may not be set apart from a lot of other movies that you seem with similar themes; however it is excellent in both visuals and story setting. You will not be disappointed in taking the time to view this movie.</p></body></html>

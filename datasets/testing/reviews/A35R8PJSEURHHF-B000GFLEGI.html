People were easily torn apart in this movie, I don't know how you can rip someone's arm off just by pulling on it a little bit or put your fingers through someone's stomach, but ok.  This movie was very dumb, but with a group of friends it is fun to see the bad make up and death scenes.  Not enough action, since that is all that really matters cuz zombie movie plots are pretty dumb.</p></body></html>

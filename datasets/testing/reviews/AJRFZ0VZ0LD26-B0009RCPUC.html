It is amazing how close this film is to the factual events of the last days of Hitler and his party.  Bruno Ganz took a lot of courage to portray one of the most hated man in the human civilazation.  His performance is one of the best I have ever seen.  To me this film was the end of personal debate if Hitler was a mad man or something else. After watching both documentary and this film, I believe that he was not mad, but he was so indoctrinated with the idea of national socialism that he was able to gain strong following amongst his own people.  Such a large group did not contain bunch of mad people, it rather contained lots of people of very much misplaced ideas.  The strength of these ideas is no different of communism in East Europe that spread like fury from Russia to the entire eastern side of the continent.  The indoctrination is so overwhelming that I still cannot overcome the feeling of knowing that Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels and Goebells' wife Magda were ready not only to kill themselves for their (lost) cause, but also sacrifice all of their six young children.  Magda Goebells beats Medea tenfold and gives a new definition to an act of matricide.  Watching film that shows final act(s) of the most important architects of Hitler's government in the last days of the WWII Berlin is very important history lesson for any person.  This film will leave you dazed long after you have watched it.</p></body></html>

Although most probably won't say this is a greater flick than his previous Blackhawk Down, I enjoyed it more, probably because of the historical connection to events present and past, and the film's story seems realistic enough so that it could have happened, and perhaps it did. All the performances were excellent, and I even thought Orlando Bloom did a decent job in his role, although up against competition like Neeson, Norton, Gleeson, and the guy who played Saladin (don't know his name, but he brought a convincing and studied intensity to the role), he has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />One minor correction, the major battle scene with what they called the ballistas are actually trebouchets. The ballistas are very large arbalests, or crossbows. To employ an overused word, the battle is truly awesome, and reminscent of the opening scene in Gladiator, but even better. It was still a couple of hundred years before gunpowder and canon came into use in the 1300s, and it wasn't uncommon to have battles in the Middle Ages where both sides were pounding each other with literally hundreds of catapults. So I thought that part was quite accurate and pretty interesting.<br /><br />Of course, with a current heart throb like Bloom in the lead role, there has to be a beautiful woman and a little romance thrown in, but this isn't allowed to sidetrack the main story as the tensions between Christian and Muslim forces build and finally erupt into at first sporadic raids and skirmishes, leading up to the final big battle with the siege of Jeruselam. Scott deftly unfolds the events and the action, controlling the pace of the movie with a sure hand, until the final climactic scene. Overall, another fine film from Scott and worth seeing on the big screen.<br /><br />By the way, a little Ridley Scott and movie trivia here, there are websites devoted to discussing the various film genres and I've seen the second Alien movie (Aliens) called the greatest action flick of all time. And this was by people weren't necessarily sci-fi fans. In fact, after seeing Kingdom of Heaven last night with a friend, the subject of Aliens came up as we were discussing Scott's other films, and my friend said that when he went to see it, the film broke and they had to stop and fix it. When they stopped the movie and turned on the lights, he said the whole audience heaved a collective sigh of relief at the opportunity to take a break from the intense, non-stop action. :-)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Concept!"></head><body><p>This movie when I first saw it in a private screening before its domestic release. I didn't know what to expect. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.<p>Unique story and an interest premise. The effects are very cool and the Stargate itself is an interesting concept. Kurt Russel begins the movie with his character as being a nasty guy, but then you warm up to him.<p>Jay Davis (The Crying Game) is a really starnge alien leader. I won't give much away but he is like a snake in the grass.<p>James Spader played a great &quot;nerdy&quot; scientist and the most unsuspecting leading &quot;love&quot; man. He falls in love with the alien female (played by Alexi Cruz)and ends up saving Earth and her planet too.<p>Overall the film is an action adventure but it also has heart. Dena Devling and Roland Emerich wrote this with Roland directing.<br />(This team also cretaed Godzilla and Independance Day!)<p>This is a good modern Sci-Fi film to have in your colleciton.</p></body></html>

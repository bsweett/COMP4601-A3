<meta name="summary" content="This year's most avant garde science fiction"></head><body><p>The collaboration between Spielberg and Cruise promises top-notch entertainment and emerges unexpectedly as this year's most audacious science fiction that is beyond categorization. It enters the realm of future techno dystopia when Minority Report based on Philip K. Dick's short story opens in 2054 with Anderton (Cruise) as chief of Pre-Crime Unit which banks on the dreams of Pre-cogs to arrest would-be felons. The story takes a twist to thriller when Anderton is framed; he is guilty of a fatal shootout - and there he runs to escape his colleagues and a sealed murderer's fate. It is a mystery when events culminate to map out relevance to his son's abduction. It is a resonant cautionary tale to explore on topics like original sin and privacy issues. Minority Report sees Spielberg at the zenith of his visions, fusing sprawling sets of sleek designs to compliment the galanizing action that sees Anderton fleeing through whizzing Lexus in vertical highways. To silence the cynics, he ventures into his darker side to effectively convey violence. The noir thriller is thick with Hitchcockian red herrings and imbued with shadows of paranoia to render first-rate suspense. No less luminous is the cast including Samantha Morton as the talented Pre-Cog who gives heart to the movie, Max von Sydow as the dominating boss and Colin Farrel as Anderton's rival. Probably his best performance to date, Tom Cruise lends emotional depth and grit under his brooding exterior. Minority Report is provocative and slyly humorous in its hidden entrende of Pre-cogs as Agatha, Arthur and Dashiell who are famous mystery authors. This is Spielberg's extension of A.I with unfettered creativity, pitch-perfect technicality and balanced senitmentality to submit a report card that would definitely please the majority.</p></body></html>

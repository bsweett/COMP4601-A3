<meta name="summary" content="Farrell: booth phony"></head><body><p>In Joel Schumacher's PHONE BOOTH (2002), unibrowed Colin Farrell makes a stink leading man. To be fair however, no matter which actor got trapped at that pay phone, this film about an unseen sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) obsessed with forcing liars and cheaters to publicly admit their venalities would be just as insipid.<br /><br />How stupid can the guy Farrell is playing be? There's probably a half dozen ways within the first five minutes for him to thwart the shooter by escaping, but this fool never tries anything crafty. Instead he hangs around long enough to be hemmed in by a wall of cops, frothing media types and assorted no-life Looky Lous. Clearly, as a publicity agent he's a slow-witted cipher so devoid of original thought it's little wonder that blatant canards and buckets of manure are his stock in trade.<br /><br />In hindsight, can you believe that not one, but TWO babes have the hots for this loser? I sure can't!<br /><br />Then we have the supporting cast. Hey, you want trashy? How about three skanky whoo-urs dropping the F bomb about 300 times in 15 minutes. Is torture your thing? Check out the flop sweat pouring off of Forest Whittaker's detective in charge. He looks almost embarrassed to be involved in this nonsense.<br /><br />Do us all a great favor, Kiefer: zero in on that guy holding the pay phone receiver and pull the darn trigger!</p></body></html>

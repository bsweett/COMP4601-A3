I'm not that guy and you can find storyboard summaries in probably most of the other reviews.  I am only focused on the quality of the DVD transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />I have both volumes on Standard Def DVDs and have recently bought the Blu Ray versions.  As with vol 1, there is little difference between the Standard Def versions and Blu Ray transfers.  The audio on the Standard version is a highly recommended DTS 5.1.  That's no slouch in the audio dept.  However, the Blu Ray version is uncompressed PCM audio, which, with proper audio editing can make a big difference.  Unfortunately, not with this transfer.  The front sound stage is very nicely used with a beautiful spread of the instrumentation of the score across the stage.  The rear channels are rarely used which is sad.<br /><br />While the video transfer on Blu Ray is better than it was for Vol 1, there is still some grain noticeable.  This is especially so when Bill drops off Uma at Mei Pei's retreat.  You can see the grain in the cement and a close up of Mei Pei's hair from the rear is soft and unfocused.  Perhaps this was deliberate, I don't know.  The improvement over Vol 1 is noticeable in the color saturation which is not as muted as with the blu ray version of Vol 1.<br /><br />I enjoy both these films from time to time and think they are great movies.  However, to update your standard def version to blu ray will have limited rewards if your expectations of greater quality need to be met.  The extras are the exact same as with the standard def versions; a making of, trailers and one deleted scene.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful in determining for yourself whether it is worth the purchase. If so, hit that 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right track.</p></body></html>

This movie to me showcased how an actor who was known by two movie series could branch out into totally new territory and "The Fugitive" is the best example of this. This is my favorite movie starring Harrison Ford outside the ID movies he starred in during the 1980s. I have never seen the original TV series so I'm not going to bother comparing that with the movie. Starring Harrison Ford as the surgeon Richard Kimble, and Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard, these two actors were perfect for their roles as antagonistic good guys, both are on the side of good but are major rivals at heart, Kimble as a man on the run, and Gerard as the pursuer of him, unaware that the real killer of Kimble's wife is walking freely without trouble and actually has one arm (His other was presumably lost in an accident). <p> It all begins at Chicago Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago where Richard Kimble is a highly respect, world renowned surgeon who is skilled surgically grafting new artificial limbs to amputees. His life however is wrecked one night when his wife Helen Kimble is murdered by an intruder and Richard Kimble is arrested and convicted of the murder of his wife when in fact, it wasn't him. After a catastrophic bus crash kills several of his cellmates, Kimble escapes and tries to get back home, determined to hunt down the one who is truly responsible for his wife's murder. Kimble is being chased down by numerous law enforcement agents who are also determined to catch him and have him put to death but Kimble tirelessly pursues the man who is really responsible for his wife's murder and the destruction of his reputation. His chief pursuer U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard however is tirelessly hot in his trail and Kimble is always on the move. A lot of really surprising answers will be discovered during Kimble's pursuit of his wife's real killer and a very shocking truth will come up about the motives behind the murder. Kimble is hell bent on proving his innocence.<br /><br /> Almost everything that can be good about a movie especially a crime thriller comes together perfectly on "The Fugitive". The main characters Richard Kimble and Sam Gerard are absolutely incredible and show amazing depth and personality. One feels incredible sympathy for the falsely accused criminal Richard Kimble but also appalled at the Marshall's hell-bent pursuit of him when he's unaware or even cares of the target he's chasing isn't the one responsible. Chicago to me, was the perfect city for the movie to be filmed in, and the various places they go are sometimes out of the usual places and even go to places that most people don't ever see. I also love how both Kimble, and the U.S. Marshall officers figure out where Kimble really is and how Kimble himself outsmarts them every time. A lot of things really come to mind when seeing this film. When I first saw this a long time ago, it was a lot of fun with the non stop action but now I have come to realize that sometimes some of the most innocent people have been incarcerated for absolutely heinous crimes that were committed by others and even met their tragic end when the real criminals have gotten away with it even if the criminals do get apprehended in the end. <p> Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are absolutely amazing in this movie and really brought their characters to life on here. Harrison Ford's role as Richard Kimble is absolutely powerful and moving and the numerous ways he gets places and defies his captors are just amazing, and even scary at times considering that serious real life criminals like drug dealers and serial killers and other felons use various means to defy the law. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones steals the stoplight....eh , I meant spotlight as the obsessive U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard as he is obsessively pursuing Kimble and bringing him in but also the two when speaking by phone are in fact helping to solve the real puzzle behind the crime that claimed Mrs. Kimble's life and pursue the real criminal whose behind it all. The other character worth mentioning is Dr. Nichols (The actor who plays him eludes me) as he brings some surprising answers especially towards the latter half of the movie. I also liked Joe Pantoliano as Gerard's sidekick Cosmo Renfro.<p> You must get this movie. "The Fugitive" is one of the most gripping, edge of your seat, action crime thrillers that has come out in the last 25 years, if not the most gripping. "Catch Me If You Can" tries to imitate the whole cat and mouse pursuit styles of this movie but while good, CMIYC pales in comparison because "The Fugitive" has such powerful drama, something missing from CMIYC. Don't get me wrong, CMIYC is good in it's own way but pales in comparison. The extras in this "Special Edition" aren't really all that much to write home about and are rather unimpressive and hardly warrant this being called a "Special Edition" and the extra content adds little if anything to an already excellent movie. If you have the older DVD that was available before the special edition came out, you aren't missing out on anything on the newer edition. Despite the unremarkable extras on the "Special Edition" DVD, this movie is definitely one to own as it's one of the best movies that Harrison Ford has starred in outside of the "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" movies. I would also say the same for Tommy Lee Jones as he is at his absolute best on this movie.</p></body></html>

As we walk alongside Jaguar Paw into the Mayan city, past disease, decay, and delirium, we can see ourselves -- just another chapter in the sordid tale of man's inhumanity to man. Of course, our make up is a little different, and we mutilate our bodies differently, too. Even our human sacrifices are different; our victims tend to be pre-natal. And while our music and culture have a slightly different rhythm, we're every bit as ruthless, every bit the mob, every bit as deluded.<br /><br />If anyone had questions about Mel Gibson's directorial skills, they're answered here. Likewise, there's ample evidence of his infatuation with viscera, with explicit depictions of flesh being ripped, gouged, sliced, and chopped. It felt like an anatomy lesson at times, with everything from the reproductive tract to the circulatory system on display. I generally dislike gruesome scenes in life and in movies, but, frankly, these scenes serve a larger purpose in Gibson's films. He puts us face to face with mortality, the spurting, pulsing reality of our flesh and blood. The fact that we die. The fact that it isn't pretty. The fact, more importantly I think, of how and why we kill each other. We live in a brutal world, folks. Eat or be eaten. That's how it is, no matter how we insulate ourselves from it. Sure, Gibson has the camera linger for a beat or two beyond what may have been necessary, but there's no disputing the guy has an artist's vision. A bit of a torture artist, no doubt, but I'll take art like this over the standard movie theater junk that's out there any day of the week.<br /><br />Some viewers may have a hard time separating Apocalypto from events in Gibson's personal life. Too bad for them. I don't know what's in Gibson's heart. None of us do. Like all of us, he's got a bit of the bigot in him. Of course, put in the context of the hammering he got from folks who never even watched his last film, one might understand, slightly, the pathology of it. That's no excuse, of course, but human beings are strange, screwed up, and generally indefensible. Gibson's no exception. That, however, does not make his storytelling, and his insights, any less impressive.<br /><br />This is a fine film, a true meditation on the human condition, and a welcome respite from all those folks who see the world in black and white -- those, for example, who view the white Europeans as the murderous thugs who obliterated the peaceful Native Americans. The reality, of course, is that we're all brutal thugs, and skin color is no defense.<br /><br />I'm not sure, by the way, whether Gibson got the Mayans mixed up with the Aztecs. The Mayans were far less known for their human sacrifices, and it would be interesting to hear from academics on this. There are some other potential historical inaccuracies I won't go into so as to spare the spoilers. Frankly, the story rises above historical circumstance, so these questions ought not get in the way of the Gibson's powerful message.<br /><br />I'm not much of a religious man, but as I walked out of the theater, I couldn't help but offer a silent prayer of the countless men and women who have died and suffered unspeakable brutality at the hands of their brothers and sisters. Not just the tens (or maybe hundreds) of thousands of Mayans and Aztecs stripped from their lives and marched to their horrifying ends, but so many others -- holocausts only varying in scale, skin color, and ethnicity.</p></body></html>

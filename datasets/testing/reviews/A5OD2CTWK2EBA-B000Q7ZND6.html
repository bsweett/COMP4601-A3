<meta name="summary" content="I hate Keanu Reaves"></head><body><p>or how ever his name is spelt. The funny thing is I cant stand hyim as an actor but gave it a viewing and was suprised by what a solid movioe it was. I was impressed im not a fan of K.R or horror made these days but it was not bad at all . To see all these 2 star reviews is interesting. A movie worth checking out, I wouldnt buy it i have thought about it but wont, but definitley woth the rent and viewing enjoyable check it out a cool flick.<br /><br />the only funny thing is , is that K.Reaves, in every movie sounds and looks and acts exactly the same the facial expression and voice tone never ever changes, ever. he is just a horrible actor, but  the overalll goodness of the picture made up for K.R being so horrible like always.</p></body></html>

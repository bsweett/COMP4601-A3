It features all the classic "Trek" elements, while injecting horror, humor, and a bit of "Trek" history into the mix. Clever writing, superb acting, and spectacular visual effects and action make this one a "Star Trek" film not to be missed.<br /><br />And now, the film has received the ultimate treatment with the "Special Collector's Edition" DVD! The featurettes are great, and the two commentary tracks (The first by Actor/Director Jonathan Frakes, and the second by screenwriters Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga) are both informative and very funny. Fans of the film, or of "Star Trek" for that matter, will not want to miss assimilating this one into their DVD Collections.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

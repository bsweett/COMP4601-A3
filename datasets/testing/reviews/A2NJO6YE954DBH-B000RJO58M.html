<meta name="summary" content="Another bloody fantastic comedy from Wright, Pegg and the gang"></head><body><p>Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg have proven that lightning can strike twice with their 2007 comedy "Hot Fuzz."  As was the case with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B2YR8I">Shaun of the Dead</a>," they are following in the grand tradition of Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6BLWE">Young Frankenstein</a>" by embracing the genre they are spoofing and taking everything that happens dead seriously, which is what makes it hysterical.  Plus, once again Pegg and his sidekick Nick Frost have created characters that have heart, so that we care about them as well as laughing at their antics (of everything that happened in "Shaun of the Dead" the part I remember most is Shaun being upset over the fate of his mother).  So when we get to the final act of "Hot Fuzz" and the film actually slips into an even higher gear, we get to root them on all that harder.<br /><br />This time around Pegg is Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a guy who is no bumbling Inspector Closseau.  In fact, Sergeant Angel is so competent that his bosses want to get rid of him because he is making everybody else in the police service look bad.  So Angel is banished to Sanford, a perfect little English village supposedly devoid of crime.  Of course Angel finds cause to arrest just about everybody he runs into, only to be informed by his new boss, Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), that they look at things differently in Sanford.  Everybody is town speaks of "the Greater Good," and it seems that we are being set up for your standard story about a hard core true believer learning that the spirit of the law is as important as the letter of the law.  Angel is partnered with PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), and we have the requisite pair for the buddy part of the picture and it looks like all of the pieces are in place.<br /><br />However, there is something rotten in the village of Sanford, personified by Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), the local rich guy.  There might not be any crime in Sanford, but there sure are a lot of accidents and Angel quickly figures out that these suspicious accidents might be sneaky murders.  The payoff for this whole bit is most decidedly English in nature, which is part of what makes it so funny, especially when old hands like Billie Whitelaw and Edward Woodward are playing some of the eccentric characters.  I do not know what the record is for most cuts in a film, but with "Hot Fuzz" film editor Chris Dickens has got to be in the running.  This movie is not just cut like an action film, it is cut like an action film on speed, which becomes another part of the fun.  An hour into this film I thought there was only a half-hour left, but it turned out we were only halfway through this entertaining film.  As for what I shall remember most from this action comedy, it would have to be the fate of the villain Skinner and one of the more memorable "boy, that has got to hurt" moments of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Runaway train, runaway action"></head><body><p>Non-stop action from the very start.  You would think with an entire movie about a runaway train that there would be some spots that would lag - but not so.  The action just keeps coming in this movie.<br /><br />Casting was perfect.  Denzel Washington - need I write more?  Chris Pine, a favorite since the latest Star Trek movie.  Rosario Dawson and Kevin Corrigan didn't have huge roles as Connie, the yardmaster and Inspector Werner but they were vital, well-played roles.  Kevin Dunn played a slimeball in charge, which he always does well.<br /><br />It is very frightening to think that this movie is loosely based on a true story that happened in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />I love this type of movie - reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICLRHK">Speed [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792838424">Runaway Train</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079284047X">The Train</a>.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jittery, plotless sequel..."></head><body><p>As agent Bourne runs frantically from continent to continent to escape his hunters he drops a suitcase. This is early in the film. What's in that suitcase? The plot. Some acting. Large dosages of common sense. Oh, and the script. Sadly, the suitcase and its contents never get recovered.<br /><br />  While the first Bourne installment was one of those rare cases of action films that actually did have a plausible story, good acting and directing, this one lacks all three. And lacking on all three it even adds up some further faults to undermine the whole affair even more.<br /><br />  The curse of the sequels? It hardly matters since as a sequel this film is simply a ghost of its predecessor, and a very unconvincing ghost at that.<br /><br />  The director decided to employ this simple trick: seeing that he's got zero plot to work with, he manically over-edited the film creating something that looks like a hyper-extended version of a long video clip. As it is with such video clips, your interest in the film will probably last a brave 10-15 minutes and it will all go downhill from there on.<br /><br />  There's no need to go deeper into this. Anyone who's seen it knows it has very little to do with the very succesful "Bourne Identity". That in turn is a pity because the first film had all the elements in place to keep the recipe functional in the sequel as well.<br /><br />  Why was it all discarded then? We wont know and we wont care.<br /><br />  At my kindest, i'd say this is worth the rental but then make sure you've got some friends over and several alternative plans on what to do when your eyes start wandering off the screen and onto other things.</p></body></html>

Miles(Paul Giamatti) who's been in numerous films, finally gets a shot at stardom, Jack (Tom H.Church) I don't think I've seen him in too many movies.  But, they played well off each other. And Virginia Madsen looks terrific, and she also gets a shot at well earned stardom.  Jack is getting married and wants to get laid for the last time. (I guess some things never change) His best friend Miles has a concience (and dosen't like lying about anything).  How these two ever hooked up in college is amazing. Jack is immature and boyish and thinks his obnoxiously charming<br /><br />slimey way will have the effect he wants it to have (and it does) He should just put a post-it on his forehead saying "please have sex with me". Miles is uncomfortable with the whole idea of using the two women they just met just so his "friend" can "get some".  Besides he really likes Maya (Virginia Madsen) and sees a possible future with her.  This is a low-key comedy, but very enjoyable.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

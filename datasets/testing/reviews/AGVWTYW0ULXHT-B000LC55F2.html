<meta name="summary" content="Engrossing and unsettling depiction of rivalry, revenge and magic"></head><body><p>The Prestige works on many levels, as a character study and a depiction of rivalry and revenge, as a period piece that illuminates the ingenuity and sacrifice and risk required to carry off the trickery and deception of stage magic.  It is a very entertaining film, that captivated my attention throughout, was very well acted (especially by Christian Bale) and very well paced.  It is, moreover, a film that does not commit the usual crime of Hollywood films of dumbing things down for its audience.  Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker who obviously respects his audience, expects them to be capable of piecing things together, and doesn't lay everything out.  (A recent film that is guilty of this sin is "Lucky Number Slevin" which was very entertaining but would have been much more interesting if the directors didn't feel the need to explain everything that anyone who had been paying attention would have already gotten, in great detail in the concluding scenes).  Most interesting, I think, is the ending of the film, an ending many other reviewers take to have been a kind of fraud or cop out.  As I read the film, the director uses this ending very deliberately to call attention to his own manipulation of audience expectations in the preceding parts of the film.  While the methods of the "magic" in the end evoke horror and disgust, they in fact serve only as a grotesque mirror of the sacrifice required by the trickery that is depicted throughout.  In hindsight, the ending can be seen to be prefigured by a very early scene in which we see how a bird is made to disappear and reappear.  We accept and admire the skill and sacrifice and risk of the artists to a point -- but only when we have the security that in the end none of it is real.  We want to suspend disbelief, but would be horrified if we truly believed.  At some level, I think this functions as an intriguing reflection on what audiences want in film: we tend to want what we see to be as realistic as possible without crossing a line to make us believe it is really real -- brutal and bloody depictions of gratuitous violence are okay, and the more lifelike the better, but images of actual violence drawn from contemporary wars generate outrage.  A film that can simultaneously do the job of being slick and entertaining, and at the same time raise intriguing and profound questions about the nature of entertainment, and of audience expectations, and of the relation between image and reality is definitely worth a look.  I know I'll be seeing it again.</p></body></html>

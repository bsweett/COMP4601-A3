This is a very stylish - and exceedingly gory - sequel to "28 Days Later."  The contagion has run its course through the UK and a NATO/US expeditionary force is tasked with repopulating Britain now that the epidemic is over.<br /><br />Or is it over?<br /><br />Man, those zombies sure do run fast!  Those undead can really motor.  Some of them must have been training with Usain Bolt.  The movie features more hemoglobin than a Red Cross Blood Bank and enough projectile blood vomiting to last you a lifetime.<br /><br />"28 Weeks Later" offers edge of your seat suspense and is a rollicking and terrifying ride!  Not for the squeamish, though.</p></body></html>

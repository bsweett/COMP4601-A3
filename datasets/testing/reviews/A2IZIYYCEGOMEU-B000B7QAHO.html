Still, Wilder dominated his film. In the newer version Depp is a somewhat demented, socially, and emotionally retarded Peter Pan. That said, his performance is brilliant, as is Freddie Highmore's. Deep Roy is also excellent as the entire band of Oompa Loompas, but the real stars of this beautifully rendered fairy tale are Tim Burton, and Danny Elfman. The cinematography, attention to detail, painterly use of color, and surreal flavor of the sets go way beyond the earlier screen version, and the somewhat dark twist to this classic aligns it more to something from the Brothers Grimm than the older, sugar-coated ( no pun intended, of course... ) WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCALATE FACTORY film. Elfman's music, as usual, not only paces the story, but helps to tell it as well. Scrumptuous- from beginning to end. It might be a bit scary for very young children, however.</p></body></html>

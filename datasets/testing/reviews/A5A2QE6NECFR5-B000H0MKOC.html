There are indeed some big laughs, and many smiles and smirks generated by the cynical story line: honorable man, good dad, makes a living shilling for a horrid product. Along the way he meets and beds a dishonorable reporter, confronts and bests sleazy talk show hosts and Congressmen, and tries to balance loving his son with a public promise to "buy him his first pack of cigarettes when he turns 18 if he wants them." It was an interesting choice for the film's creators to try to humanize a tobacco lobbyist, and in my view, they succeeded at that. Despite despising the product he promotes, I had to root for Nick to prevail in his various trials. If there could exist such a compliment as "At least he is honestly dishonest" Nick would have earned it. Worth seeing for its twisted heroes and villains and smart writing, yet not quite the dark comic masterpiece it might have been.</p></body></html>

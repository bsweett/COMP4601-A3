<meta name="summary" content="The Rocky saga ain't over until Sylvester Stallone says it is over"></head><body><p>It is easy enough to say that "Rocky Balboa" is a much better ending to the cinematic saga of Sylvester Stallone's most famous creation than "Rocky V," because that 1990 was clearly the bottom of the barrel for the franchise.  But "Rocky Balboa," the new "last" Rocky movie is not only a lot better than the last "last" Rocky movie, it does a good job of bringing things full circle and reminding us of why the original 1976 film scored a big upset by winning the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br /><br />Adrian has died and Rocky's son (Milo Ventimiglia) is tired of living in his the shadow of his famous father, who spends his days at his wife's grave and his nights at his bar.  With his old friend Paulie (Burt Young) in tow, Rocky visits all of his haunts from the old days (that is to say, from the first film), and pretty much everything is in ruins.  The exception is "Little" Marie (Geraldine Hughes), the kids who rejected his advice in the original film with the comeback "Screw you, creepo."  She is grown up now and a single mom, and when she denies she ever said anything that rude he assures her that she did, adding a comment about the longevity of great insults.  Rocky takes an interest in Marie and her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III), hoping to fill the voids in his life but never thinking that they are replacing his wife and son.  Then the Fates once again intervene in his life and give Rocky an unlikely match against the unpopular current heavyweight champ, Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), which means it will be time to cue Bill Conti's famous music, go through another training montage, and have Rocky climb the steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum.<br /><br />However, all of that happens relatively late in the film.  Of course, Stallone wrote and directed the grand finale, and having thought long and hard about his character that is primarily what this film is about.  The fight is a necessary part of the Rocky formula and therefore of this story, but most of the memorable scenes and lines from this film come before Rocky ever steps into the ring.  One of the casualties of the Rocky franchise was the fantastic lesson of the original film that you can be a winner without winning.  That is the sort of thing that Yogi Berra might say (or that Joe Garagiola might say that Yogi said), which is quite apt since Berra's "It ain't over 'till it's over" is the film's tagline.  But such ideas are at the heart of the Rocky mythos and Stallone has not simply returned to them, but found a way to rearticulate them in terms of the life of his character at this age and at the center of his shrinking circle of family and friends.  One of his best moves is that the big fight is meaningful for his opponent as well.<br /><br />Stallone is not only working off of the Rocky mythos but also drawing inspiration from the real world of boxing, explicitly updating the original computer match that had Rocky Marciano beating Muhammad Ali.  There is also the idea of the ex-champ's restaurant, which harkens back at least to Jack Dempsey's place, where he tells stories and poses for photos (Ali makes people pose for shots where you put your fist against his chin like you are landing a hard one on him).  Stallone knows that even those who do not own a George Foreman grill probably know that he was the oldest man to win the heavyweight crown even if they do not remember how old (Foreman was 45 when he won the title, 20 years after losing it to Ali, and would hold it another three years).  So in Stallone's screenplay Mason "The Line" Dixon gets the chance to prove the computer wrong and as soon as that robe comes off in the right before the fight it is clear that even at "50," Rocky is totally chiseled and in a lot better shape than Foreman.  We are also reminded that Stallone knows he is doing when he choreographs a fight.  Included in the deleted scenes is an alternative ending that only reinforces what we already knew: namely that what you see in this movie is the way the saga of Rocky should end (Stallone's commentary track is well worth listening to as he juggles his varying perspectives as writer, director and actor).<br /><br />For me things get a bit too artsy in the fight, where suddenly shots are looking like a cross between "Raging Bull" and "Pulp Fiction," and every since that slow-motion fall and rise ending to "Rocky II" I start to worry when Stallone starts getting too cute.  But whereas previous bouts have been about Rocky finally landing the big blow, this one is definitely all about Rocky being hit.  In case anybody does get the point, the key line in the film echoes in Rocky's mind at the pivotal moment: "But it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward."  We have had ample reason to be cynical and Stallone and his creation for a couple of decades now, but both the creator and his creation evince a lot of the heart that made us care about them in the first place.</p></body></html>

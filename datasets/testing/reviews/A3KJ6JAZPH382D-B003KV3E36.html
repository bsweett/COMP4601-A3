Boom!"></head><body><p>Given the decent job Sylvester Stallone did reigniting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N4SHPS">Rocky Balboa</a>, I had decent hopes that "Rambo" might be as good. Alas, not too be. The aging John Rambo is a snake catching recluse in Thailand, still having flashback nightmares about being a supersoldier and giving 'that 1000 mile stare' to show he's still in a war zone somewhere in his head.<br /><br />Along come a band of arrogant missionaries who want to save the world by sneaking into Burma (aka Myanmar) and giving out Bibles and pills. John Rambo stands in the dark rain and grunts things at them until the pretty missionary (Julie Benz) babbles some nonsense about caring and he cracks. Why Rambo suddenly decides she is worth changing his mind over is never given, he just does it. Then...Big Surprise...the missionaries are caught by sadistic Myanmar goons who think fun is betting on which POW will get blown up in a race through a mine field.<br /><br />Thus it is up to John Rambo and a bunch of foul mouthed mercenaries to extract the prisoners. They do so in standard comic book style, all smart-mouthed quips and great big guns. The goons are creepy torturing rape machines, and so they must all be destroyed, right? Of course! And so, Rambo and his motley crew rescue the fair maiden and her friends with unbelievable amounts of blood, explosions, splatter, decapitations and screaming. The final ten minutes of "Rambo" are ridiculously surreal and dopey, including the patriotic rah-rah of making a wimpy snot-nosed pacifist into a real man by having him bash an enemy's head with a rock. USA!! USA!! USA!!<br /><br />Given that you have no true idea why Rambo has a thing for Sarah (Benz) or why he'd agrees to take/save her, the characters have all the depth of a blood splatter. (Even as hyper-masculine as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EQ">Rambo: First Blood, Part 2</a> was, you empathized with John Rambo.) The mercs are a multi-national pack of clich&eacute;s who look down on Rambo until they suddenly decide to follow every order he gives. The missionaries, other than Sarah and Michael, are human props. It was hard to give a darn about anyone involved, as the whole movie is a gloriously shot excursive in mayhem. Unfortunately, for all the flying body parts and spewing blood, "Rambo" has no heart. It is as generic an actioner as they come, which is a huge disappointment after what Stallone did with "Rocky Balboa."</p></body></html>

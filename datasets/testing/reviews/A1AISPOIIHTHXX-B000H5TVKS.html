<meta name="summary" content="This is pretty much my problem with today's horror films"></head><body><p>I'm going to name 3 movies: Rosemary's Baby, the Shining, the Exorcist. What did they have in common? They scared the living hell out of everyone that watched it(some less so but oh well). What about films like Scream or Urban Legend or that Summer one? It was cool seeing WB stars getting chopped up. And now we have the latest batch of horror movies: out and out full-on gore movies. This film and it's prequel, Wolf Creek and Hostel were films with really quick editing and brutal gore. But personally that's not scary, it's just gross. Saw 2 doesn't change this, even though it's admittedly good concept is intact.<br /><br />The Jigsaw Killer is hard to describe as a murderer since he doesn't actually do it, his victims do. Being someone who "saves people's lives", he devises ways where people have to do something painful in order to escape. Most of them don't escape and that's where the gore comes in. It's a neat idea, although Seven used this in a way, it's just the filmmakers are a little frustrating in making a genuinely good horror movie.<br /><br />A detective finds out his son is locked in a room along with a couple others and their game is this: a nerve gas is in the house they're in and they have to find the antidote in 2 hours or they'll die. So we jump between 2 stories: the detective trying to solve it on his end and the unfortunate victims who might face their grisly ends.<br /><br />The film's central line is "oh yes, there will be blood" and it's a pretty spot-on tagline: gore is very rampant here, probably moreso than the original which you will always expect. "Carnage candy" as a kid in Scream 2 puts it but after awhile it kind of gets old, it's not as shocking anymore when the 4th one gets taken down in a grisly fashion and you don't feel disgusted anymore, at least I didn't. Sure it's gory but when we don't care about anyone living or dying, having someone die in a gory way is like "ooh, that hurt" rather than just being horrified.<br /><br />It is a film concept that can be so much more but unfortunately these films are just a way to kill people in grisly fashions and call it a horror movie. Rent at your own risk.</p></body></html>

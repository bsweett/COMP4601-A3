<meta name="summary" content="Jack's back!"></head><body><p>On the day that Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is to be married to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a detachment of East India Company Marines, headed by the former Lieutenant (now Lord) Gillette, suddenly arrives with warrants for their arrest, based on the part they played in saving Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the hangman's noose.  Though Elizabeth's father the Governor (Jonathan Pryce) protests that they are under *his* authority, not the King's, Gillette is adamant.  The only option he'll suggest is that Will fetch him Jack's peculiar compass (which never points north) and a strangely configured key.  If he does, he and Elizabeth will be freed and Jack will be furnished with letters of marque, making him a privateer of the crown.  Will doubts that Jack will be eager to give up his freedom, but he has no choice except to go along.  Jack, it turns out, has troubles of his own.  To gain a captaincy he made a bargain with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the demonic captain of the Flying Dutchman, who is now ready to demand payment.  Jack protests that a mutiny deprived him of 10 of his promised 13 years, but Davy isn't interested in excuses, and he wants Jack's soul.  Jack knows that if he can gain possession of Davy's heart--reputed to be locked away in an iron chest whose key is the same one Will is seeking--he can save himself, and even for old allies Will and Elizabeth he isn't willing to share.  But when Will discovers that his own father, Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard), is a member of Jones's crew of the damned, he resolves to obtain the heart himself and use it to kill Jones and free his crewmen.  Then former Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), who was cashiered from the Navy after twice failing to capture Jack, enters the picture, resolved that gaining the heart will help him "get his life back."  So now there's a three-way race for the heart--or maybe five, if you count Jones and his crew, who are trying to protect it, and our old friends the formerly-undead Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), who don't know what's in the chest but can plainly see that a lot of other people seem to want it.<br /><br />Convoluted though this plotline may sound, it all works out surprisingly well, with plenty of top-notch special effects and costumery (especially the design of Jones and his crew, all of whom partake of the characteristics of assorted sea creatures ranging from hermit crab to hammerhead shark); Jones himself is one of the best--one of his forearms is actually a giant lobster claw, but his head and face are based on some kind of tentacled univalve, possibly a nautilus, and the tentacles on it are in constant writhing, restless motion.  (He and his crew, and the gigantic Kraken he commands, may be a bit scary for the youngest kids, which is probably the reason for the rating.)  Add in a brush with a tribe of cannibals, storms, escapes, and wonderful swordfights, plus Depp recreating his slightly fey piratical character, and you have a very satisfying, if rather long (over two hours), adventure/fantasy movie.  Hans Zimmer provides a thrilling score <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FTCF2M">Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a>.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stunning and spectacular sequel"></head><body><p>Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later was a surprisingly great horror treat, and 28 Weeks Later is no different.  Picking up six months after the events of the first film, 28 Weeks Later centers around the United States military helping restore the mainland of Britain after the rage virus has been wiped out.  Cowardly father Don (Robert Carlyle) is re-united with his children (Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton) while everyone else tries to get back to normal.  Unbeknownst to everyone though, is that Don's thought dead wife (Catherine McCormack) is not only immune to the virus, but has become a carrier for it as well.  As you can no doubt guess, it doesn't take too long for things to get very, very bad.  Though I was a little apprehensive upon hearing that Boyle and original writer Alex Garland were only on hand as executive producers, my fears were put aside when the film kicks into high gear during it's opening sequence.  The cast is more than solid, and features Jeremy Renner (SWAT) as a heroic sniper, Rose Byrne (Danny Boyle's Sunshine and FX's Damages), Harold Perrineau (Lost, Oz), and an all too briefly seen Idris Elba (The Wire) as the stoic General Stone.  The gore ante has also been considerably upped from 28 Days Later, with some impressive and brutal effects.  All in all, 28 Weeks Later is a stunning sequel that surprisingly manages to live up to (and in some cases top) the original film, and is more than worth checking out for horror fans, zombie fans (normal or running), and fans of the first film alike.</p></body></html>

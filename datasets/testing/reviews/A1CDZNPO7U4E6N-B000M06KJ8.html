<meta name="summary" content="I THINK NOT!!!"></head><body><p>This movie can be described in one word...BORING! Absolutely nothing happens so I can't imagine why it was even 2 hours long. This is one of those movies that is ultimately forgettable. It's the kind of movie that in a year or two you'll remember seeing it, but you won't really be able to remember what happened. I think somebody already beat me at saying it, but it seems like the movie was mostly about Kirsten Dunst eating cake and drinking wine for two hours, but that's only when she wasn't buying shoes, clothes, and hats. Other than that, she was married to a man that wouldn't have sex with her..SO WHAT! I felt so mislead after reading the coverbox to this film in the video store. I couldn't believe they referred to this character as a villianess who lived life on her own terms. A woman who didn't walk the line between royalty and being a commoner. I saw none of that at all, but I did see beautiful cinematography and costumes. Even the intentional use of music (very bad music) that wasn't even apart of that era didn't help this movie out. I turned this movie off and took a nap at least twice before I finished it which is never a good sign. Sophia Coppola is really tring to make her family proud of her by living up to the family name, but she won't be able to do it like this. At least not when she's responsible for movies like this. Don't waste your time like I did.</p></body></html>

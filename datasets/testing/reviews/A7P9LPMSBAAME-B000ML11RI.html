Incredible visually. Very impressive. I thought the Mickey Rourke character was so well done by both Rodriquez and  Rourke. I liked it completely. For me, this movie is about cinematic art. But don't be confused, this is not an art movie by as means. ADULT COMIC BOOK. The back story on production and history of original comics is great.</p></body></html>

He doesn't seem to waste a single moment in this film.  While it is listed as 85 minutes long, if you take out the credits, it is about 77 minutes.  Good acting all around, and some nice humorous characters to keep things from being too much.  The idea is very simple, a woman boards a flight, a man sits next to her and tells her that her father will die if she doesn't help him to assassinate a political figure.  The tension on the late night flight is very good, when they land, the movie becomes less special.  I would probably give this one an extra 1/2 star.</p></body></html>

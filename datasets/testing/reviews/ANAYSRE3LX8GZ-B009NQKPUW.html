With that said, it was more a very try-hard effort to try and inter grate the two together, meaning, it's really only the end of the movie that kind of ties it... it's like it was either meant to be an unsuspected surprise, but with every critic already telling you it's confirmed it is a prequel, that surprise has been blown away, and the ending it self looked like it was included at last minute.<br /><br />The story is probably what you expect from seeing trailers. In 2090 or so, a couple of archeologists/explorers find a cave in Scotland with some ancient paintings on the wall that show a star system. Putting two and two together, they link this start system to a bunch of other ancient drawings from around the world and luckily have the technology to head towards those stars in hopes of discovering where mankind evolved from. When they get there, they find it has a moon orbiting a planet that has an atmosphere that is not quite breathable to humans, but it most likely is the planet they have come to explore. They land on the planet and discover a bunch of structures that they decide to go into and blah blah blah blah... outbreak.<br /><br />The characters of the movie aren't so much the reason I didn't enjoy this film. For the most part, every actor did a decent job in being a believable character. All but two actors. One being the old man who has terrible make-up, and the other being whats-his-face who played a robot (that guy from X-men First Class as Magneto) despite the bad make up of one, both characters seemed very dry and make you beleive they are planning something very sinister only to be killed off in seconds when their time comes (Well, the Robot guy doesn't die, but still), which left me thinking, "what was the point of all that crap building up to this then?"<br /><br />The other thing that brought the whole thing down was the pace. It was too slow, and focused too much on creating a CGI environment and wasting time with pointless character interactions that lead to nothing. An example of that would be the Charlize Theron's role of being something of a dull and lifeless military woman who you wonder if she is human or not, but by the end of the movie, you realize, it wasn't leading up to something with her useless scenes of showing she is heartless, no, it was just a terrible role, much like the other guy who played Magneto.. whatever his name is... dull, lifeless, almost completely pointless.<br /><br />If only Elvis was around to tell Riddley Scott that he needs a little less conversation and a lot more action, then there might have been a decent flick here, but instead, it did the cheap thing it was most likely written for, to get Alien fans to hear it's a prequel, then suck them into any old rubbish, and end it on a note that there will be a sequel to this prequel.... and I won't be wasting my time with it if it does.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Smart. New. Different."></head><body><p>This DVD has been reviewed nearly 500 times so there's not too much that you can say that hasn't been said. One repeating theme is the movie's comparison to the "investment projects" of Hollywood. That Hollywood has the best technique, stars, cinematography, $s, and gimmicks is all true. What it often doesn't have is that sense of taking a chance. Lola does.<br /><br />The presence of a basic problem, lovers on a downward spiral, need not be examined. The consequences of THE ACT is ignored and in its place is the examination of the details of the turns and twists we make each day which brings us to THE ACT.<br /><br />We probably cannot alter what has happened, Tykwer theorizes. But what occurs to Lola and Manni is perhaps a lesson for the future. How small changes, doing small things differently can impact the result drastically. The 'inadvertant ripple in the pond theory.'<br /><br />I found it to be a smart movie, smarter than most created on the West Coast, provocative, out of the box, with an eye towards embracing 'the what if we make just one change' question. It's no wonder it has become an international cult film with an enormous truly diverse following. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

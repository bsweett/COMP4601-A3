Young Frankenstien is a person who has liveed his life under the morbid shadow of his grandfather, Baron Von Frankenstien. This is withoutadoubt (one word) one of the funniest movies you could watch. The movie itself is only partially old, but its black and white filming gives a great classic feeling. There are so many puns that there is no way in heck you could memorize them without repeated viewings. I love that. My brother in law, a rather picky viewer (pickier than me) (even more pickier than others) watched this with me the other day. He was chuckling his head off. Just watching HIS reaction made me roll on the floor with tears coming down my face. (I do that when I laugh hard). Well, I suppose my point is that this movie is a class A comedy, that even the pickiest of people love. The dude is a stone! An unbreakable critic that...well. You get the idea. Watch it for liquid rendering laughs. (Might wanna watch it after the kids go to bed!) *****</p></body></html>

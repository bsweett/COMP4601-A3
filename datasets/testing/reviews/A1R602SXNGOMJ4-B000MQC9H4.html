The movie is about two women trying to get over their last relationship and to do so they switching houses for the holidays. During the switch the two girls find the meaning of real love. In Iris's (Kate Winslet) case she was still in love with her ex that had left her for another woman, sometimes as women we tend to hold on to things that make us feel happy for moments but at the same times makes very unhappy. While Iris is in California she finds a new friend, a 90 year old man who advices her that by holding on to a friendship with her ex and that now takes advantage of her feeling towards him for his own benefit, is only hurting her. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) in the other side of the world finds a Graham (Jude Law) a man who has trouble showing who he really is; she discovers that is her problem too, and in the short time they spend together they find a way to be happy with themselves.  Iris finds Miles (Jack Black), who is going through something very similar to what she went through and helps him to solve it, and at the end get together.  Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet make this movie great. They both shine equally and neither tries to steal the limelight. This is one of the first roles that Kate has done as a comedy and it she does it very well.

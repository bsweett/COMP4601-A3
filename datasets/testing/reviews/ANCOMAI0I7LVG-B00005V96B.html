<meta name="summary" content="Boo!"></head><body><p>As far as Pixar is concerned, they are sort of modern day geniuses.  I mean, outside of the horrendous `Cars' (I refuse to see `Cars 2'), they have had one homerun after another.  `Monsters Inc.' was one of the first Pixar films to really grab my interest as an adult.  Considering that `Toy Story' was released when I was ten, it was an instant hit with me at the time.  `Monsters Inc.' on the other hand was released when I was sixteen.  It's a lot harder to convince a teenager that an animated film is worthy of their time since to a teenager the word `cartoon' can mean one thing; `it's for children'.<br /><br />I was not a child anymore.<br /><br />That said, it was a film that some of my `female' friends wanted to see and so we all went together.  We loved it.  But honestly, what isn't to love?<br /><br />`Monsters Inc.' is yet another imaginative offering from Pixar, the studio that continues to reinvent animation by giving us vivacious stories of superheroes, flying houses and rats that can cook.  Here we have the story of a monster community that scares children to keep their city running.  Scares capture energy that is used like electricity.  The film focuses on two particular monsters, Sully and Mike.  When they inadvertently bring a young girl (who they affectionately refer to as Boo) back to their world, everything gets tossed upside down.  In the process we get a special and tender glimpse at the world of monsters and we see them come to a more docile understanding of their own existence.<br /><br />By the end of the film you'll just want to squeeze Sully so tight!<br /><br />The voice work is remarkable (but what else would you expect from a company that immortalized Ellen DeGeneres as a fish).  John Goodman is perfectly cast as the warm and lovable Sully (that voice is so serene and calming) and Billy Crystal IS Mike Wazowski!  The animation is crisp and endearing, with bright colors and remarkably real landscapes.  It's a stunning addition to the Pixar filmography, and one that everyone would be proud to own.<br /><br />I guess cartoons aren't just for kids anymore!</p></body></html>

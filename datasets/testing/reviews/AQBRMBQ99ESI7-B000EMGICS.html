<meta name="summary" content="Going for the Triple Crown"></head><body><p>Jennifer Aniston plays a neurotic and insecure woman engaged to be married. She is heading home to Pasadena with her boyfriend to attend her sister's wedding. She feels like she has never fit in with her family but she doesn't really go over the deep end until she hears a rumor. She hears that her family served as the inspiration for THE GRADUATE, starring Dustin Hoffman.<br /><br />She does the math and realizes that her father may not really be her father. Her mother is unable to answer any questions, having died many years before and her grandmother, played brilliantly by Shirley McLean will not talk about the matter. She decides to try and track down the mystery man.<br /><br />Her search leads her to a wealthy and successful entrepreneur played by Kevin Costner. He confirms the rumors about the book and the movie but maintains that he cannot be her father. He also sees Aniston and decides to try for the Triple Crown. This attempt leads to even more familial confusion and damages more relationships.<br /><br />This film has a few light moments but it is not great as either entertainment or as a work of art. It is one of those things I am glad to have seen but have no need ever to see again. The most likeable character in the whole piece is the dad, the real one who raised the girl. He is matter of fact, truthful and manages to get keep everything in perspective.<br /><br />If you do watch this film, it definitely helps to have seen the original GRADUATE. I suppose one could follow the story line without having seen it but it will make much more sense with that frame of reference.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nice try -- but not quite."></head><body><p>There's a lot to like about American Werewolf in London -- and just as much that's aggravating and disappointing.  Apart from David Naughton's thin performance in the lead role, the acting is solid, with Jenny Agutter the standout as a pretty young nurse who's a sucker for animal magnetism.<br /><br />The film snaps from comedy (some of which works, some of which doesn't) to fairly realistic gore -- with nightmare scenes that give the entire story a sense of the surreal which is fairly unusual in a mainstream film.<br /><br />The story is short and highly simplistic -- with little depth; the twists and turns, such as they are, simply don't engage.<br /><br />I like American Werewolf for its tone, its sense of freshness.  It's a flawed film, but likely John Landis' best work.</p></body></html>

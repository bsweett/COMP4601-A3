We do."-Rorschach"></head><body><p>Based on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel, "Watchmen" works more often than not and although director Zack Snyder's film may not be perfect, it's an extremely good adaptation of that work capturing the essence of what made the graphic novel so good.<br /><br />The "Director's Cut" of the film features 24+ minutes of additional and extended scenes. Some work such as the confrontation that Dr. Manhattan faces by reporters on a TV show while others such as the murder of an important supporting character suffers from weak dialogue and acting by the extras.<br /><br />There are some minor artifacts but on the whole the film looks stunning on Blu-ray. The special features are quite nice introducing a unique one in particularly called "Maximum Movie Mode" that you quickly get the feeling will be over or misused by others. In "Maximum Movie Mode" you director Snyder appears on screen during certain scenes detailing how the scene was shot. You can also access production photos/comic book pages for a comparison/contrast between how the film was storyboarded vs. the final outcome. You can also see the actual shooting of the scene while watching it again be aware however that this isn't presented in a picture-in-picture mode. It does interrupt the film but you can quickly navigate back to the film itself. There's also an alternate "Timeline" with photos comparing our world to the world of "Watchmen". It's  marvelous special feature that could only be presented in Blu-ray because of the higher bit rate/capacity of the format.<br /><br />***<br />The rest of the special features are located on disc two. We get a number of very good featurettes on the film itself from "The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics" which points out many of the innovative techniques, use of subtext and layering of the various stories that Moore & Gibbons used to present "Watchmen" back in the 80's to "Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes" which explores how the characters are mirrored in real life in our world.<br /><br />"Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World" allows you to dig into the technology of "Watchmen" ranging from Dr. Manhattan's Martian get-away to Nite Owl's ship. We also get the 11 "Watchmen" video journals which were originally on-line as well as the video for the song "Desolation Row" by My Chemical Romance. There are also BD-Live features planned for the future. You can share many of your favorite special features via BD-Live through Facebook. Some of this material is a bit repetitive because of the visual commentary track that Snyder does.<br /><br />We also get a third disc with a digital copy of the film and the code which is active for a limited time."Watchmen" had a long and painful birth--it went through director's, writers and producers more rapidly than a kid eating a candy bar.It's the 1980's and Richard Nixon serves out his third term as President. The U.S.won the Vietnam War due to the intervention of superhero Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup)and the other superheroes now banned by the government from intervening in the affairs of ordinary folks. When the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)is murdered the vigilante hero Rorschah (Jackie Earl Haley in a marvelous performance)as he tries to discover who is trying to eliminate America's former heroes. He contacts his old partners Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre II aka Jupiter (Malin Akerman) and Ozymandis (Matthew Goode) to convince them that they need to band together to discover who wants to eliminate them.<br /><br />"Watchmen" may be flawed but Snyder's ambitious film overcomes many of those flaws by introducing a fascinating story filled with colorful, conflicted characters. One of the flaws of the film are some of the surface, shallow performances by the actors and part of that can be laid at the feet of director Snyder and his writers on the film. While many of them can't dig in underneath the surface of these characters and expose what's truly going, others such as Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre's mother Sally Jupiter and Crudup as Dr. Manhattan reveal a significant amount of what drives their characters. Part of the issue is the film format itself which allows limited time and space to portray the same story that was told over many issues of the original comic book itself and part of that is that Snyder becomes so enamored with his visuals that he loses track of the very human element he's trying to portray. Still, flaws and all I doubt anyone else could have tackled "Watcmen" and succeeded as well as he has here. Producer Joel Silver who had the rights to produce an earlier version of the film (which would have starred Arnold) recently commented that he felt his version would be a better version of the film, more populist reaching a broader audience. What he fails to realize is that is precisely what would have watered down and ruined what was unique about "Watchmen". The fact that Snyder makes a relatively faithful, visually epic that nicely captures the flavor of the graphic novel IS an outstanding achievement worth noting regardless of the flaws.<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

The town tells of a headless horseman who searches the town for his head so that's why he takes people's heads for himself..to find his. Soon Depp digs deep into the towns past secrets about the headless horseman, Ray Park (plays the horseman without its head and starred in Stars Wars Episode 1 The Pahntom Menace and X-Men). Back in one of the wars the  evil horseman, Christopher Walken (plays the horseman with his head on and starred in Catch Me If You Can and The Prophecy) , is killed and his head is cut off. Depp also in the process falls in love with the beautiful Christina Ricci (Addams Family Values, Pumpkin). Also Depp has flashbacks to the murder of his mother with a very memorable scene where his mother pops out and blood flies out with her. Not a scary movie but it's a pretty entertaining flick and Tim Burton is at the top of his form trying to figure out clever ways to chop heads off. Also starring Miranda Richardson (The Crying Game, Spider), Ian McDiarmid (everysingle Star Wars movie), Christopher Lee (Lord OF The Trings Trilogy, Gremlins 2) and Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers, Modern Vampires). Depp is hilariously brilliant.</p></body></html>

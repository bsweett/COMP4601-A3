The speical effects were top notch, the acting was what you'd expect for this type of movie, and pretty good gore and killings. The only problem I have is the movie is too dark to really see anything. The best part of the movie was the first person shooting scene, that was awesome. Very good movie, even though it is pretty dark.</p></body></html>

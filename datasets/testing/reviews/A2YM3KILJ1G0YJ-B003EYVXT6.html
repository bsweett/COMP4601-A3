<meta name="summary" content="Splice: The subject material as well as the genre.  Neither works exactly as planned."></head><body><p>Two criminally negligent and scientifically malfeasant bioengineers - Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrian Brody) - splice DNA to create new life-forms for their cutting edge facility, Nucleic Exchange Research & Development (NERD).  When the scientific breakthrough of the millennia (causing a great Carrie tribute in the middle of the film) that could potentially cure a myriad of diseases isn't quite enough, they toss a little human juice into the equation, despite Clive's numerous protestations, and bring their Frankenstein into the world.  The eventual result is a pseudo-humanoid they name Dren, that ends up looking sort of like a 21-year old Telly Savalas, but with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, ostrich legs, and a tail.  A slew of other genetic surprises and advantages as well.  Don't worry though, because the two were implausibly able to keep this genetic monstrosity a secret from everyone else in the lab.  So no problem.  Wink, wink.<br /><br />Up to this point the movie is exciting, interesting, and fairly original.  The pair of fraternizing scientists - absolutely no chemistry, by the way - quickly form bonds with the freakshow, eschewing any sort of moral or scientific responsibilities.  And that's only the half of it.  Dren ages and learns rapidly, exhibiting both human and animal reactions, creating a more complex conundrum for the couple.<br /><br />Sounds enjoyable, right?  Well, the third act devolves into a completely contradictory blend of Jeepers Creepers and backwoods West Virginia, as the controversial ending eliminates any audience involvement or momentum previously created.  From sci-fi thriller to horror film in the blink of an eye...except the viewer doesn't adapt as quickly as Dren.</p></body></html>

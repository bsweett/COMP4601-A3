<meta name="summary" content="I've Seen Better Psychos!!!"></head><body><p>I bought this film for a good price having heard alot about it and with the word psycho in the title, I just had to see it. The only good thing about this movie is the bloody killing scenes. Other than that, I found this movie boring at times. To call it terrifying is going a bit too far. Even scary is a bit too far. If you like the serial killer type movies, you might like this one but don't be prepared to be blown away!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT PREMISE, BUT TOO LONG AND INCONSISTENT! 3 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>This is a tough film to review because I'm sure a lot of people loved it and a lot of people hated it. I liked the film because it is undeniably original and has a haunting quality with excellent FX. Unfortunately what I didn't like about it is that the film seems very choppy and loud, which distracts from the interesting story. I know this was intentional, but I'm not sure it was that way to go. I think the premise could stand alone without all of the bouncing around and explosions.<br /><br />No one seems to have touched on the fact that this film is a satire about illegal immigrants, I know the setting mirrors the apartheid, but it's really more global in its conception.  It's a very cool film, but I was bored at times, which is hard to believe because the film is stunning to look at.<br /><br />I wish that you could change your star ratings on reviews as I'm sure this film will grow on me over time and I might have bumped this one up another star.</p></body></html>

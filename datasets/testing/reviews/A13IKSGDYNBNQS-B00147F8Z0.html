Bits from these movies and a few bits from some of the lesser sequels are strung together to make an action flick, which whilst having the same creatures lacks any originality. So we get a recreation of 'Newt' from Aliens a Ripley like strong female character and all manor of other rip-offs from the other films in both series. In my view Alien vs Predator (2004) was a decent attempt to keep a franchise alive. Not brilliant but certainly worth watching. This isn't worth watching.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original films, or your have only seen Alien vs Predator you will have no understanding of my criticisms. If so go back to the beginning and watch 'Alien' (1979) alone in the dark for one of the scariest horror/Sci-fi films ever made. Then watch 'Aliens' (1986) to see the best war movie in space ever made. Finally watch 'Predator' (1987), which is not in the same class as Alien/Aliens but is still a high class action/Sci-fi movie.<br /><br />When you have done that you should then watch 'Requiem' and all will be revealed (tripe).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious"></head><body><p>Finally, a chick film for the chick film haters! Bridesmaids is the equivilant of a really good, rauchy guy flick, but for the ladies. Everything from the cast to the script, to the gags is utterly over the top-but in an awesome type of way. I can't remember when I've laughed this much, and I don't even like watching comedies, and certainly not anything labeled 'chick flick'. Is it predictable? Sure, but at least it keeps you entertained til the very end.<br /><br />The premise is as simple as it gets-two best friends, one is getting married, and then of course there are the other bridesmaids-ALL with issues of their own. And then you get to witness every event prior to the wedding get completely messed up in some way, from the engagement party, to the bridal shower, to the bachelorette party. And probably one of the funniest scenes- the girls go pick out their dresses.... Really, it's best to just watch it instead of having people talk to much about it. Yes, it's on the raunchy side to it's not really suitable for kids, but for everyone else, it's a go! Plus, this is not just for girls. I really think the men will get into it as well!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A brilliantly composed masterpiece of a film..."></head><body><p>In what may very well be David Fincher's best film since `Se7en' the audience is taken on a dark and mysterious ride through the lives of a select few, from policemen to reporters to cartoonists who all have one, and really only one, thing in common, the Zodiac Killer.  Now, having just seen `American Gangster' this past weekend and just now having seen `Zodiac' for the first time I feel that I can safely dispel all comparisons.  Personally I don't think the two are comparable, although I've seen many judge one off the other.  I won't say now which I feel is the better film since at this point they are both in my top five of the year, but I will say that each in their own rights deserves the attention they have been garnered.  Hopefully Oscar buzz will carry this early release to the finish line for it deserves a slew of nominations, Best Picture not absent from that list.<br /><br />The film is based off of the novels written by Robert Graysmith chronicling the investigations of the many Zodiac murders which started in the mid-60's.  With that said the film revolves around Graysmith himself and his unhealthy obsession with the killer and discovering his identity.  Graysmith was not a detective, not a police officer; in fact he wasn't even a reporter.  Graysmith was a cartoonist with a knack for puzzles who just so happened to crack one or two sent by the killer and thus started his freefall into dangerous territory.<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer took many lives, most of which were not by means of a gun or knife, and that is what this movie exploits.  This movie is less about the people The Zodiac murdered and more about the people who suffered greatly while attempting to find him.  Robert Graysmith, Inspector David Toschi and reporter Paul Avery all lost years of their lives to this case, self inflicted as it may have been.  They lost family, respect, jobs...all in the pursuit of a killer who, to this day, has never been captured.  Graysmith says to his wife Melanie that he needs to know who The Zodiac is, he needs to look him in the eyes and know that it is him.  I'm forced to ask myself, why?  I mean, is it really worth wrecking your whole life just to track down someone who couldn't care less about you?<br /><br />Maybe it is.<br /><br />Maybe it was.<br /><br />The one thing that I admired about `Zodiac' and `American Gangster' as well (I will write my review for `American Gangster' soon...most likely when the DVD is released) is that they both take their time.  They are not in a rush to tell a story; in fact they slow things down and make sure that they tell the story right.  They breathe life into their characters so that the audience can feel a connection.  So, I assume you can tell from that statement that this is not a short movie.  It's slow paced which adds to the overall feeling of the film.  It's eerie, it's creepy, it's dramatic...it's here to instill paranoia (`American Gangster' is slow paced as well but not for the same reasons...it is far from eerie).  David Fincher does a fantastic job of understanding the mood he is creating and embellishing upon it.  It reminds me of the feeling I got while watching Bennett Miller's film `Capote'.<br /><br />Fincher also lucked out with his electric cast.  Everyone participating in this film does a fantastic job, none more so than Robert Downey Jr., who in my humble opinion should be frontrunner for the Oscar (but alas, he's not).  Downey Jr. beautifully fleshes out Paul Avery, giving him charm and charisma and drive and then masterfully deteriorates him so that the audience can see the man The Zodiac left behind.  Mark Ruffalo also delivers excellence as David Toschi.  He has such fervor, such motivation until his everything starts to crumble and he seeks to escape.  What is beautiful to see in each of these performances is that while both men try and distance themselves from The Zodiac we can see that it is within this enigma that they truly flourish for when Graysmith approaches both men with the subject their eyes ignite, even if they turn him away.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is effective here as Graysmith, but he gets lost a bit amidst such an eclectic cast.  Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo chew so much scenery that Gyllenhaal struggles at times to remain the center of attention.  He's a fine actor and is slowly by surely being molded into a great one, but it becomes apparent when placed beside better actors with sufficient material that he is still out of their league.<br /><br />The long list of supporting players is impressive as well.  I love me some Chloe Sevigny, and even though her role is a small one she is supremely effective.  Brian Cox and Philip Baker Hall are great in their roles and Anthony Edwards does a fine job of playing second fiddle to Ruffalo.  Most impressive though is John Carroll Lynch who plays the prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen.  He only has a few scenes, one in particular where he is interviewed, but that one scene has such presence.  He creeped me out and it was daylight.<br /><br />In the end `Zodiac' is a superb film, a stunning and mesmerizing example of cinematic perfection.  It's not a horror film but is a film that will succeed in getting under your skin and biting at your nerves.  Fincher should be praised (as he has been) for creating one of the best crime thrillers in years, a film that sets the bar for films to follow.  Now if only every crime drama could reach these heights.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Here is why..."></head><body><p>I watched this movie yesterday....and I found this film to be very intense in fright factor....interesting special features, especially the actual crime scene footage/photos....very sad story...I feel that the actors did a wonderful job with the material that they were given....<br /><br />So why the three stars....Hollywood of course...having seen the original, and being a bit skeptical then about the whole story, I feel that this adaptation was sensationalized for the benefit of the filmmakers....<br /><br />Here is what I believe...the crime...yes this did happen (hence the crime scene material...including interviews with ppl that were actually there...interesting!!!<br /><br />Now the overall story....this one is a stretch...yes I believe that the house was haunted....but do I believe half of the stuff that happened to this family...no some of this is/was not believable...in fact back in the 80's it was said that the Lutz's claims (most of them) were unfounded and untrue....<br /><br />So...here is for the final verdict....good movie...decent adaptation...now it is time to put the story to rest....</p></body></html>

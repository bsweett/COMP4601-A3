<meta name="summary" content="The Pie of Life"></head><body><p>Simple and complex this story delves deep into the complexities of relationships in life.  For the most part I think everyone could find a piece of this pie that is like our lives in general.<br /><br />Jenna is the main character married to a not so nice husband named Earl.  Jenna is a sweet woman who finds out she is pregnant early on.  Most of her challenge comes from trying to find out if she really wants her baby.  It is something I am sure many women have worried about in a loveless marriage.  Jenna has just been given a new doctor after finding out her familiar doctor is retiring.  Her new doctor is a man and the complexities come from that.<br /><br />The story then seems to get more complex after that.  It becomes evident how unhappy Jenna really is and how she expresses her feelings thru her creative pie making.  As she becomes closer to her doctor they start a romantic relationship.  Jenna now must fight between her happiness she has just found and not cheating on her husband.  Of course everything could be perfect but it isn't.<br /><br />This movie is really wonderful and I am sure just about everyone will be able to relate to it in some way.  The happiness, sadness, and even anger.  Waitress does a excellent job really showing the trials and tribulations of life.  Nothing is simple for the most but making sure you as an individual is happy is the key to life.  Yes this movie has a message and a good one at that.</p></body></html>

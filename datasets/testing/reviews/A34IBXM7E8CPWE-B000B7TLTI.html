So I was excited to see previews for "The Incredibles", it looked like the perfect family movie, something I could enjoy and the kids could as well. "The Incredibles" lives up to the hype. Both of my kids couldn't stop talking about it and want to go again...even (gasp!) choosing to see this again over Spongebob when it comes out! The story is a lot of fun, and it's funny, how now, as a 30+ year old cubicle dweller, I can relate to Mr. Incredible and his longing for past glories. Pixar's animation is, as always, a real treat. It's amazing how Pixar's characters just come to life, and express more emotional range than a gaggle full of Keanu Reeves. And though "The Incredibles" is rated PG, there is nothing in the film that should keep you from taking your kids. This really is a great family film, and one that adults will be able to enjoy as much as the kids.</p></body></html>

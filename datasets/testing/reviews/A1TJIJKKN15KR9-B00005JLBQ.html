<meta name="summary" content="This Road Could Use More Twists and Turns"></head><body><p>Despite an outstanding cast (Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Daniel Craig and Paul Newman's final screen appearance), under-explored setting (organized crime in the depression-era midwest) and very solid inspiration (it's directly and admittedly influenced by Lone Wolf and Cub), this never quite congeals into anything more than a dull, formulaic revenge picture. Hanks, usually the beating heart of a film, is chained down by a dry, emotionless turn as a distant father figure whose young family is virtually wiped out by an out-of-control colleague. On the path to revenge he tries to reconnect with the only other survivor, his twelve-year-old son, but the two have such a faint rapport that the inevitable payoff lands on a flat note. Craig and Law are worthwhile in their roles as quirky, irredeemable psychopaths, but get so little screen time it's tough to develop an appreciation for the nuances of either. For the majority of the run time we're just tailing Hanks, at his most wooden, as he systematically wipes out the opposition. Bland, redundant, over-long material that misuses its many blessings.</p></body></html>

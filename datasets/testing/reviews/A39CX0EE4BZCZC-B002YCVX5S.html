<meta name="summary" content="Exceeded Expectations"></head><body><p>In addition to the great acting and good direction, the Blu-Ray transfer, for those of you interested in that, was the best I've ever seen - just flawless.<br /><br />The movie was up for eight Academy Awards so you know there were a lot of aspects to it that were done well, from the acting to the photography to the sound and screenplay.  Yet - see below - I had read a lot of negative reviews on this movie and really wasn't anxious to see it.  I only saw it because it was free at the library. Afterward, I was so impressed I bought a copy.<br /><br />As I reflected upon this film, I realized how good it must have been to keep my interest as well as it did for two-and-a-half hours of mostly dialect and a lot of it with subtitles.<br /><br />It made me realize just how intense and good the actors were in this film, all of them with a lot to offer. Brad Pitt is the "big name" of the group, and his character is really strange, but there is an "unknown" German actor in here, Christopher Waltz, who stole the show as "Col. Hans Landa, The Jew Killer." He was just mesmerizing, particularly in the opening scene which was incredibly tense. I'm glad to find out he won an Oscar for his performance.<br /><br />Melanie Laurent wasn't far behind as far as good acting and an interesting character as she played the beautiful-and-vengeful "Shossona Dreyfus/Emmanuel Mimieux."</p></body></html>

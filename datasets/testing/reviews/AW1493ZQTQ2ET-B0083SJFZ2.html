In that regard, it's interesting that Zeus created the human race, and yet he depends on human worship for his immortality while being unable to force humans to worship. Why this dependency?  On top of that, his demigod son Perseus prefers to live as a mortal human, even though he has the choice of living as an immortal god ...<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is reasonably entertaining, though the action isn't enough to increase your heart rate much, if at all.  The special effects and scenery are good though, again, not best in class.  And the acting is likewise decent, with some well-known actors in the movie, though they don't have much to work with in terms of story or characters.  In short, not a total waste of time, but certainly not a movie I'd want to watch again.<br /><br />Last but not least, my wife picked this out as a "family" movie, but be forewarned that the level of violence is probably too much for young children (hence the PG-13 rating).</p></body></html>

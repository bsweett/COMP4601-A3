<meta name="summary" content="And you think you had a rough day at work..."></head><body><p>When human error leads to the spectacle of a fully powered, unmanned freight train carrying toxic materials at over 70 mph into a heavily populated area, a veteran railroader (Denzel Washington) and a rookie (Chris Pine) must work together to bring it to a halt while the nation watches on cable television.<br /><br />I've been waiting for a really good runaway train movie since...well, "Runaway Train," and it's finally here.  Director Tony Scott lets nothing stand in the way of the action, yet still manages to present characters we care about and an intelligent story (screenwriter Mark Bomback) that clearly explains the factors that led to the disaster and the steps taken to rectify it.  The result is an efficient, thrilling action picture that is easy to recommend.</p></body></html>

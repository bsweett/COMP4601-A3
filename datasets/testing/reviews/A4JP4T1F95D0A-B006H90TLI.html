The desolation and bleakness is overwhelming at times, as is the extreme violence that explodes on the screen.  Based on the Cormac Mccarthy novel, this is a wonderful cinematic experience.  Great acting from top to bottom, this is a film I will buy the day it is released on dvd.  Though it is dark, there are a couple of quirky scenes which make you laugh.  The only problem I see for people is the ending.  This isn't a typical hollywood ending.  All of the loose ends are not tied up and everyone goes home feeling good.  I am looking forward to listening to the commentary while watching the movie to get a better insight on some scenes.  This is a must buy.</p></body></html>

The 40 to 50 minutes added turn Kingdom of Heaven from decent to a flat out masterpiece. You will now get more insight into each character and finally see why they were motivated to make such rash decisions that didn't make much since before. I have a feeling this version would have been up for the Best Picture Oscar if the studio didn't force Ridley to chop it up. The case is beautiful, the extras run for hours on end, and the film is finally being shown the way it was always meant to be. Believe it or not, I now think that this film is one of Ridley Scott's finest achievements. Go buy the 4 Disc Set, you'll love it.</p></body></html>

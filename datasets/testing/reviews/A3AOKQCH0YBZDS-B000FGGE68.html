<meta name="summary" content="Boring, Bad acting and Storyline!!"></head><body><p>The only redeeming feature of this flick are the special effects and costuming!<br /><br />The rest of this movie sucked. The acting was bad, monotone, and one dimensional..... No depth of character.<br /><br />The fight scenes were badly choreographed, phony looking and fake. Too many of the fight scenes in "Ultraviolet" were poorly reminscent of "The Matrix" and "Aeon Flux", and made this movie feel like a shoddy imitation in comparison. Both "The Matrix" and "Aeon Flux" were far superior movies in in terms of plot, acting, special effects, fight sequences and more.<br /><br />Ending of this movie wasn't great either, nor very creative. Found it difficult to want to watch this movie through it's end result.<br /><br />Don't waste money or time renting or buying this movies!</p></body></html>

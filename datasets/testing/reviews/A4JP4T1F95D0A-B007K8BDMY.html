<meta name="summary" content="Differant"></head><body><p>An interesting look at the life of Timothy Treadwell.  Timothy is a self proclaimed grizzly bear protector.  He spent every summer of his last 13 years camping out in the Alaskan wilds observing and interacting with the animals until the final summer when he and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by a bear.  The filmaker takes 100 hours of Timothy's footage and mixes in interviews with his friends and family to make a documentary on Timothy's life as it related to his love of the bears.  What drives this film is how eccentric Timothy is.  A failed actor, but still charismatic, he finds a way to make himself a celebrity.  He rages against the rules to camp away from the bears and not interact with them.  He constantly puts himself in danger and proclaims this is how he would want to go.  The film does not play the audio of the attack, but it is mentioned as existing and people do comment on it.  A bit long, the film could have been trimmed a tiny bit, but it is interesting.</p></body></html>

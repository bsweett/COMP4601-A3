Why not get together with some buds and go on a male-bonding motorcycle trip?  Let that testosterone rip, by golly.  Be cool (for maybe the first time ever).  What's so hilariously coincidental is that three of my close buds (all solidly middle-aged) just took a bike trip to the New Mexico Rockies (I was invited, but politely declined), so when I stumbled across WILD HOGS I had to pull up a chair and watch the madcap shenanigans of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy gone wild.  (Yet unlike this cast, my friends didn't have a run-in with the Del Fuegos.  Darn.)<br /><br />The movie is silly, predictable, often lame, and decidedly over-the-top, but come on; it's still funny and entertaining--plus there is an undercurrent of midlife angst that resonates with old cusses like moi.  I especially liked the give-and-take between our heroes and the rough and ready Del Fuegos, led by a bristly Ray Liotta (who was born to play a biker gang leader).  But the Del Fuego who steals every scene he's in is the versatile Kevin Durand (who was outrageously fantastic in his brief role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SF4">Smokin' Aces</a>); Durand's reaction, during the closing credits, when the Del Fuegos' bar was resurrected in a spoof to Home Makeover had me rolling on the floor.  So midlife might not be so funny, but trying to spice it up can be, and WILD HOGS proves it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent, well-acted science fiction entertainment"></head><body><p>"I, Robot is very well done science fiction entertainment.  The story is roughly based upon the great Isaac Asimov's robot stories, particularly "Robot Dreams" which was one of his last robot stories.  This one is set in the 2030s.  Robots are well-accepted components of society, and humans are growing increasingly dependent upon them.  "US Robots" is a huge and powerful company that manufactures the robots.<br /><br />US Robots is about to release a much more intelligent and powerful robot model.  Detective Del Spooner (Wil Smith, from Independence Day) has reason to doubt the safety of the new robots, and it turns out he has a point.  More would be telling.<br /><br />This one is faithful to Isaac Asimov's vision of robots integrated into human society, and the effects that this might have.  The special effects are terrific, and the robots are believable and realistic.  The story, while somewhat over the top, is nonetheless engaging and fast-paced.  Next, I would like to see a movie made of Asimov's Elijah Bailey series of novels, which is also part of the "Robot" series.  This movie proves that this would be practical.<br /><br />Recommended.

Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring.  There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me.  For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.<br /><br />Peter J.

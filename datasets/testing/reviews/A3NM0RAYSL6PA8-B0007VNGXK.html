<meta name="summary" content="Ron Perlman.  He's the whole movie; the rest is 'meh'"></head><body><p>Hellboy is cliche after cliche, but with one heck of a sweet performance by Ron Perlman as Hellboy himself.  And there's the rub.  This really should have been a movie about Hellboy and his travails, sinking deep into his character--perhaps even as a narrator.  Instead, we get a pastiche of well-worn fan-boy story standards--Nazis, Lovecraftian "elder gods," Nostrodamus, etc.--tied together by unnecessary clutter.  And then, every so often, Perlman drops in with an endearing scene, and some great lines.<p>There's no great villain here.  The special effects are so-so (you can even see Perlman battling the wires on one jump), and the directing is workmanlike and not much more.  Too bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="captain america battles red skull and his elite hydra force..."></head><body><p>While some of the Marvel superhero films don't do a great job of adhering to the source material, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) does better than most, as it succeeds in capturing to a large degree, the spirit of the comics which saw the genesis of the character during World War II.  The film features Captain America battling his greatest and most ruthless adversary, Red Skull, the personification of Nazi cunning and fighting spirit, and the leader of the Third Reich's secret weapons branch.<br /><br />In superhero movies, setup and character origins typically eat up a nice chunk of time in the initial film.  That is somewhat true here, but the process is streamlined by Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the future Captain America, not having a complicated backstory, and the action being set in the already familiar setting of World War II.<br /><br />The year is 1942, and a patriotic Steve Rogers has once again been classified 4F, and rejected by the army.  Recruited by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), the scrawny Rogers finds himself in uniform, as a volunteer in a top secret experimental program to develop an enhanced fighting man.  The process is successful, as Rogers becomes a muscular specimen, but when Erskine is assassinated, the secret of the process is lost.<br /><br />Instead of an army of supersoldiers, there is just Rogers, and as the costumed "Captain America" he is used mainly as a public relations tool for the red, white, and blue.  Under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), Rogers is in Italy entertaining the troops, when he learns that his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been reported missing, while battling German forces led by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving).  With the help of British intelligence agent Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), Rogers embarks on an unauthorized rescue mission.<br /><br />Dressed as Captain America, Rogers frees Barnes and other American soldiers being held prisoner.  Schmidt the leader of a force of specially trained HYDRA agents, reveals himself as Red Skull, a man who has aspirations that exceed even Hitler's.  Rogers puts together a strike force, and sets out to destroy all of HYDRA's forces, leading to a dramatic final battle with Red Skull, and setting the stage for Captain America's appearance in The Avengers (2012).<br /><br />With World War II as the canvas against which the action takes place, Captain America: The First Avenger successfully captures some of the spirit of the comics, while adding a ton of high-tech enhancements.  There isn't much time devoted to character development, as director  Joe Johnson focuses on keeping things moving, and making the second half of this darkly atmospheric fantasy, as action oriented as possible.<br /><br />Although the war becomes a complete parody, borrowing from films like Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America is still one of the better Marvel adaptations to date.  With a rating of 4.5 stars, don't miss this one while it is available on Amazon Prime.</p></body></html>

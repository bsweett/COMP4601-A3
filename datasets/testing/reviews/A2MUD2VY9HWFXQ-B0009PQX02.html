<meta name="summary" content="Been there done that ......."></head><body><p>We've all seen movies such as "Hostage" played out time and time and time again......<br /><br />A cop with a traumatic experience from his past has settled down and taken on less responsibility, only now to find himself in another tense situation that not only endangers the life of more innocent victims, but also his family's lives as well.<br /><br />Of course, the events now occuring force the cop to relive and work through those old painful memories.....giving our title character (Bruce Willis) one more chance to do right whereas he failed so miserably before.<br /><br />If you haven't seen "Hostage" and you have read this far, you can pretty much guess how it all wraps up .....<br /><br />Formulaic and generic to say the least, "Hostage" is a somewhat entertaining movie of recycled bits that have been made and remade time and time again.<br /><br />Although it's hardly original, "Hostage" isn't necessarily boring, and it does prove itself to be watchable.<br /><br />However, this reviewer felt somewhat of a hostage himself, mentally pleading with my DVD player to "LET ME GO" about halfway into the films run.<br /><br />Redundant and cyclical, "Hostage" is only worth a viewing if you have nothing new or better to do for 2hrs out of your day.</p></body></html>

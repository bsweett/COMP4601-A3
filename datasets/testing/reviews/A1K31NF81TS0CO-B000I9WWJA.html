<meta name="summary" content="Great Flick!!!  Do the right thing, and rent this DVD!"></head><body><p>I borrowed this from my local blockbuster, on Tuesday Launch day, August 8th!  I think it was fantastic!<br /><br />I really enjoy the Spike Lee joint movies, especially ones that pair up my main man, Denzel with Spike.  They totally rock!<br /><br />The movie's title sets up the premise, and we are treated to 2 hours of "victim" interviews, as the police department tries to figure out who the inside man was.  I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say, you will be shocked!<br /><br />Rent this one, and enjoy an excellent movie!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check yoself, 'fo you wreck yoself!</p></body></html>

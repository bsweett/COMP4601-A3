That the films are simultaneously art house and big budget is a testament to his keen sense for what audiences enjoy that they probably didn't realize themselves. A copycat certainly; overrated perhaps; but I have to give the guy credit for his surprising commercial success with films that are essentially about other films. He's not always successful, but sometimes Tarantino hits the right note with his self-referential, genre-bending, absurdist bloodbaths. "Inglourious Basterds" is one of those times. The film takes its name and genre from the Italian 1978 "macaroni war" film whose title is spelled correctly. Who would have thought it possible to make a macaroni war flick (or a parody of one) appeal to modern audiences and make it funny to boot?<br /><br />The setting is German-occupied France in the early 1940s. American Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his team of 8 Jewish soldiers were air-dropped into France with the purpose of scaring the bejesus out of the German army by killing and scalping every Nazi in their sight. Their tactics are sufficiently extravagant to inspire fear in their enemies and furor in the F&uuml;hrer back in Berlin. Meanwhile, Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a Jewish dairy farmer until her family was murdered by SS "Jew Hunter" Col. Hans Landa, is hiding in plain sight in Paris, where she operates a cinema under an assumed name. A smitten German soldier, Pvt. Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), campaigns for her theater to host a grand German movie premiere, while the British and the Basterds see the extravaganza as an opportunity to kill a lot of Nazis with one big bang.<br /><br />"Inglourious Basterds" doesn't take trouble not to offend anyone. The Basterds are not just stereotypical brazen Americans, but sociopaths. The Brits are refined and organized, but effete and ineffectual. The Germans are overbearing, cruel, and quite mad. Shosanna and her lover Marcel (Jacky Ido) are the only sympathetic characters, and their plans are not exactly virtuous. But they're all immensely entertaining. In Tarantino fashion, many scenes do nothing to further the plot. They're filled with the director's signature pop culture banter -World War II style, in three languages. Half the jokes are in subtitles. It works. Those scenes are in turns suspenseful and hilarious. Austrian actor Christoph Waltz deserves the abundant praise he has received for making Col. Landa a pleasant and ruthless bureaucrat. His vicious caricature somehow has great charisma. The plot does nothing more than build to the explosive showdown, but the dialogue is where the real action is.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc): Bonus features are 2 extended scenes, 1 alternate scene, 4 trailers (teaser, domestic trailer, international trailer, Japanese trailer), and "Nation's Pride Full Feature" (6 min), which is the entirety of the Zoller biographical film we see in the film, entitled "Stolz der Nation" in German. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish, though I'm not certain if all of the dialogue is dubbed. "Inglourious Basterds" characters speak three languages: English, French, and German, so the film is intended to be viewed with subtitles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="junk - but at least it is pure and genuine junk"></head><body><p>If anything would prove that most films based on comic book or computer game characters are rarely worth a jot of concentration, this one should.  This film is terrible on every level - wooden acting, silly stunts that are obviously computer-enhanced, and the most flaccid plot you could imagine, just pure formula garbage.  The worst.<br /><br />Don't bother, unless you want to vegatate and wallow in mindless pap.  There is nothing to recommend this film, not even you-know-who's computer exaggerated chest.</p></body></html>

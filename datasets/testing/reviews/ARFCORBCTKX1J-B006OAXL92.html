<meta name="summary" content="yet another "children's" film adults will enjoy much more"></head><body><p>My reaction to the first two minutes of "Hugo" was that they had more wit, humor, charm, and the sheer /pleasure/ of watching a motion picture than the whole of "The Muppets" (which I'd watched the day before). As several reviewers have pointed out, "Hugo" embodies the reasons we go to be movies -- to be moved and enchanted.<br /><br />"Utterly boring"? I guess there just wasn't enough drug use, car crashes, rape, and disemboweling to hold the reviewer's attention.<br /><br />I have two not-unreasonable complaints. The story starts off as a tale about an orphaned child trying to recover his life, then turns into a biography of one of motion pictures' great pioneers. The forced, "necessary" quality of the latter doesn't sit well with the "poetic" quality of the former. And the story's belief that the innocence and idealism of children are capable of redeeming adult lives is... well, wishful thinking. ("Hugo" is hardly the first film with this belief at its core.)<br /><br />Regardless, an exquisite motion-picture experience that you should not deny yourself.</p></body></html>

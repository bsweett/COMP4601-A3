<meta name="summary" content="Fans of Stiller & Wilson Love It, Others Go Elsewhere"></head><body><p>STARSKY & HUTCH is not a great film.  It is not even a good film.  I went through a series of stages while watching it.  At first, I did not think I was going to like it at all.  I do not really care for Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson all that much and I found their other collaboration, ZOOLANDER, a complete travesty.  But in the first five minutes, I felt the film had some promise.  However, as in some of their other films, I feel that you either love watching these guys play themselves or you do not.  Neither of them is able to create dynamic characters.  Instead, they just simply play themselves in every movie and let the cards fall where they will.  Of course, I realize that there are some pretty serious fan clubs out there for both of these guys.  Thus, if you are someone who loves watching either of these guys, then you will probably get a kick out of STARSKY & HUTCH.  But if you are not a fan of these actors, then there really is not a lot here to justify the expense of purchasing the DVD.<br /><br />Of course, there are some winning moments.  The trumped up "partnership" of these two guys gets to be quite funny at certain points and Will Ferrell's brief performance is a scream, as always.  I never saw the original TV show, so I cannot comment on the film's "accuracy."  However, given the standard performances of these two guys, I wouldn't be surprised if the film fails to resemble the original at all.  I would describe it as a mediocre comedy at best.  The only reason to watch it is if you like Stiller and Wilson.  STARSKY & HUTCH has them both in spades.</p></body></html>

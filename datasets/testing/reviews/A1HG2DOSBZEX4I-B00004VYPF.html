<meta name="summary" content="What A Glorious Feeling"></head><body><p>Singin' In The Rain is one of those rare films where everything works: casting, music, sets script and costumes. The two disc package by Turner Entertainment helps the viewer to see and understand the place of the musical in American film history.<br /><br />The story of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Conner) and  Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) is familiar to most viewers. The inside look at Hollywood in the time of the transition from silent film to talkies has been covered in other places but nowhere is it as effective as it was in this 1952 film.<br /><br />The Special Edition Package contains a weath of material that has been restored completely. The film is in spectacular Technicolor and looks even better than it did when it played on the screen. There is a commentary with nine participants hosted by Debbie Reynolds that covers just about all aspects of the production process. A feature called Rell Sound provides clips from films that were critical to the sound to talkie transition. A branching feature on Inspirations for the film gives three segments of hidden footage relating to specific scenes. The first disc is rounded out with the original trailer and some cast and awards information.<br /><br />The bulk of the special features are on disc two. The disc starts with the feature length Musical Glorious Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM. This feature highlights the life and work of the famed producer. A second feature What A Glorious Feeling is a 35 minute retrospective coving the making of the film and is hosted by Debbie Reynolds. There is an extended selection of excerpts of the Freed-Brown musical numbers taken from their original films. This is a wealth of material that puts the songs from the film in perspective. The final section of the disc gives us the original MGM Orchestra scoring sessions for just about all of the music in the film.<br /><br />This is a well put together package that is a joy to watch. It is essential viewing for any fan of the MGM musical period.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DAWN OF THE DEAD"></head><body><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD is George Romero's sequel to his horror classic NGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and it is just as good as the first film. This time, we follow three men and a pregnant woman who lock themselves up inside an abandoned shopping mall to get away from the living dead that have risen from there graves and taken over half the world population. We all know that you can kill one of the living dead by shooting it in the head or chopping the head off, and if a human is bitten by one of the living dead they will eventually turn into the living dead. The survivors in the shopping mall are able to take what they need (food, clothing, personal items, etc.) in order to make it for as long as they can without going outside of the mall. Soon, a gang of bikers and rebels find out that some people are hiding out in the mall and they decide to break in and take what they can't get. Now, the living dead find there way into the mall and a showdown takes place between the survivors, the bikers and rebels, and the living dead. This film has horror, drama, suspense, and some humor thrown in for good measure!</p></body></html>

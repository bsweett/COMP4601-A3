What starts as a simple fairy tale becomes an enjoyable and darkened experience for the viewer.  Although it is a fairy tale, it's not your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JBWWRY">Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TG9E2">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a> type fairy tale.<br /><br />If you do not like subtitles, I suggest that you do not even think about watching this movie.  There are subtitles.  It is not distracting at all.  You will be missing out on one of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />This 2 Disc edition features the same commentary and video prologue as the single disc edition, but adds some featurettes on the second disc, including a look into faun, the fantasy world, and a making of featurette.<br /><br />Must Have.</p></body></html>

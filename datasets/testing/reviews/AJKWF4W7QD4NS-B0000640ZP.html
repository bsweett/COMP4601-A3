<meta name="summary" content="A better than expected thriller"></head><body><p>After hearing all the hype surrounding The Others I finally decided to give it a look and found it better than what I had expected.  Nicole Kidman plays a religious mother living in her large home on the island of Jersey in 1945 with her two children, both of which suffer from a disorder where they blister and turn very sick from being exposed to too much sunlight.  When Kidman hires some new servants strange things start going on, and an otherworldly presence is felt.  Kidman is great in her role as an overbearing mother who really does love her children, but takes it to a new level.  Director/writer  Alejandro Amenabar (who wrote and directed Open Your Eyes which would be re-made as Vanilla Sky) effectively uses atmosphere over flashy special effects to achieve a chilling tale of mystery and suspense with a twist ending that seemingly comes from nowhere.  All in all, anyone looking for a good thriller should definitely check out The Others.</p></body></html>

Who can ya call! (cue the music). With nowhere else to turn, the genius's beautiful partner calls on the famed Charles Townsend Detective Agency, whose business end is managed by three beautiful, tough and resourceful ladies who once...well, we never find out what they once were, but that doesn't matter since there appears little if anything they can't do.  Of course they're not as mysterious as the identity of the reclusive Charles Townsend, but they get more high-energy action here.  (Personally, I think he may be linked to the shadowy Blake Carrington, but that's just my theory.)<br /><br />Each Angel epitomizes this differently - with Alex (Lucy Liu) being the most resourceful, Dylan (Drew Barrymore) as a tomboy who can fight off a quintet of baddies while tied to a chair (in a scene that riffs on a drugged and chair-bound Schwarzenegger's telling his captors exactly how he'll escape from his cuffs and what he'll do when he's out in "True Lies") and Natalie (Cameron Diaz) who won't let an epic judo-death match get in the way of snagging a date. Director McG knows that TV franchises haven't been doing that well on the screen (anybody catch "Mod Squad"?) so he turns the film into a cross between an extended music video, a parody of action movies and a barb aimed at the idea of taking TV to the big screen. (The film opens on an airplane where 1st class passengers are forced to watch "TJ Hooker, the Movie"). The  strategy works mostly because of the power brought by the stars who know when to team up and when to grab the spotlight. With plenty of matrix-style fight scenes, every fight seems to bend the laws of gravity. The film also works on the strength of the co-stars - Bill Murray bringing his deadpan shtick to Bosley, but also Tom Green as Dylan's semi-psychotic boyfriend, Matt LeBlanc doing his Friends routine as a low-wage actor in bad movies, but also Crispin Glover as the psychotically silent android-like killer who enforces for the bad guys. If you need a reason to suspend your belief, if only for 2 hours, grab the Angels, and press "Play".</p></body></html>

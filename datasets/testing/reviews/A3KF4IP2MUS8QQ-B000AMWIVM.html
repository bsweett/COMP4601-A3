<meta name="summary" content="The first true horror masterpiece of the 21st century"></head><body><p>Simply put, Saw is the best horror movie I've seen in years.  I know some people don't seem to like it, but this horror fan is just wallowing in the bloody effectiveness of this extremely dark, intelligent, gory masterpiece of a film.  It's such a thrill to see something certifiably different make its way to movie screens; these days, Hollywood horror filmmakers have gotten so lazy that they can't even make sequels of films - instead, they just remake old horror films that don't need remaking.  Frankly, I'm a little tired of watching teenagers get slashed up in the woods by rednecks and inbred mutants.  I want something new, something fresh, something bold, something ruthless in its execution, something that engages my intellect while assaulting my senses.  Saw fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />As Saw moves toward its gory denouement, it unleashes a number of great surprises, and the ending is well-nigh perfect - I certainly didn't see it coming.  You may think you know what is going on, but I'll wager that you'll be mistaken.  Best of all, there's no deus ex machina plot device to ruin everything - i.e., as surprising as the final revelations are, everything comes together in a heartbeat to make perfect sense.  I really can't say enough about the script put together by Leigh Wannell and James Wan - it's bloody brilliant.  I love this movie.<br /><br />The Bad Man in Saw is downright sadistic; rather than merely hunt his victims down and kill them himself, he creates elaborate "games" that lead to painful deaths brought about by the participants themselves.  He chooses his victims carefully, selecting only those who are guilty of some "crime" or indiscretion that he feels should no longer go unpunished (and when one former victim won the game, he did in fact let her go - and in one twisted sense, she was better off as a result of having played the game).  The particular game at the centerpiece of the film (which is actually rather mundane compared to some of the killer's previous ones) pits two men together in a filthy underground room and challenges one player to kill the other within a certain time limit if he wants to keep his wife and daughter alive.  That would be Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes); his partner in torturous suffering is a young fellow named Adam (Leigh Wannell).  Both of them wake up in this room without knowing where they are or how they got there.  Our imaginative dark lord of sadism provides the two with some hidden clues and "tools" that do much to keep things really interesting.  Did I mention both men are chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room, and that there's a bloody dead guy lying in the middle of the floor?  Oh, how I wish I could tell you more about what happens, but I wouldn't dare deprive any Saw virgins out there from truly enjoying this magnificent film.<br /><br />I must admit that I expected to see nothing but gore in this movie - mindless, bloody gore.  Certainly, there's gore all over the place, but this is the exact opposite of a mindless thriller.  Yet again, a small-budget film has far surpassed the best horror films Hollywood has to offer, proving once more that a strong and intelligent plot, not gore in and of itself, is the secret for succeeding in this darkest of genres.  Saw is truly a horror film for the ages, the first true horror masterpiece of the 21st century.</p></body></html>

Fred Astaire plays Tony Hunter, a Hollywood song-and-dance man who comes to New York to star in a Broadway flop. Cyd Charise agrees to be his dancing partner. Neither thinks the other wants him/her in the show, so they don't get along very well - at first. Not only does Astaire get the show on the right track, he makes things right between him and Charise. They also dance fantastically together. Jack Buchanan is brilliant in a minor role. The great music by Comden and Green, with marvelous songs by Dietz and Schwartz, are what make the movie exceptional: BY MYSELF, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT, DANCING IN THE DARK, I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE MY PLANS, TRIPLETS, I LOVE LOUISA, and, best of all, A SHINE ON YOUR SHOES all became standards in the Great American Songbook. The movie is a great earful as well as an eyeful.</p></body></html>

WEDDING CRASHERS is a movie that belongs in the latter category.<br /><br />As is known by most people before they watch it, the plot centers around two 30-something bachelors who arrive as unexpected guests at weddings of people whom they don't even know.  The plot is actually believable;  how many people do you see at weddings that you've never seen before in your life?  The objective, of course, is for them to "score" with the chicks who feel all Romantic and sensuous after the wedding festivities.<br /><br />While juvenile, the plan goes smoothly until one of them makes the critical "mistake" of falling for a girl he meets at a wedding.  From there the movie almost (and I stress almost) goes from being a party movie to being a Romantic comedy.<br /><br />The cast is splendid with Owen Wilson up to his usual tricks and Rachel McAdams as the sweet & loveable and innocent heart-stealer (not to mention eye-candy!).  20+ years after SOMEWHERE IN TIME, Jane Seymour is still gorgeous.  Christopher Walken is great as the intimidating father figure.  It's a delight to see distinguished actors like Seymour & Walken in a cinematic farce like this.<br /><br />If you like party movies or Romantic comedies, you'll more than likely fall for this one.  So, if you're not busy on a Saturday night, maybe it's time to crash a wedding!</p></body></html>

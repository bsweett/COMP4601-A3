Great acting and absolutely perfect casting complement sharp, although not terribly realistic in spots, dialogue.  The moral point -- you have to grow up fast when you make the wrong choices but being an adult doesn't mean you always make the right ones either -- is a great life lesson and not easily captured in movie form.  Highly recommended for adults.</p></body></html>

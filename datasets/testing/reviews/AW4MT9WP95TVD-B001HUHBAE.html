While there is no definitive conclusion and the movie runs a bit long, it remains engrossing from begining to end.  All of the actors here (and there are many) do excellent work. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey Jr. are excellent.  Sevigny and Gyllenahhal have a nice chemistry in their scenes.  The script is intelligent and detailed (not without some humor)and surprisingly suspenseful at times. Great detail to time an place also add to the treats in store.  Well worth a view.</p></body></html>

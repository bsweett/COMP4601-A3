<meta name="summary" content="EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW VW BUS, NOT A LOT OF SUNSHINE IN THIS SUNDANCE WINNER"></head><body><p>First, I read the script by Michael Arndt, which I found to be intelligent and interesting; but not great and only marginally funny.<br /><br />Then I watched the movie by husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They added a lot to the script visually; but many of their decisions were based on time and budget constraints, which caused them to pare down some of the more important scenes of the film, making it less impacting. Like the beauty pageant: in the script, it was much bigger, more outlandish and more climactic. Or Frank and Dwayne's trip to the beach: the script had them taking surfboards far out from shore, causing one to wonder what they really had in mind (another suicide attempt?) and coming back wearing "Loser" T-shirts. The directors pared that down to a trip to the end of a pier. Many of the comic effects (like double-takes and revealing glances) were ignored, and many of the funnier lines were spoken so nonchalantly and sotto voce that they were virtually thrown away.<br /><br />The best character in the story was the yellow VW bus. After that, Abigail Breslin as Olive and Greg Kinnear as Richard were good; Toni Collette as Sheryl and Alan Arkin as Grandpa were okay; Paul Dano and Steve Carell were disappointingly miscast and could have passed as corpses through most of the film. None of these were Oscar-winning performances, nor should this have been a Best Picture nominee. The directors took this script and tried to make it a cross between the outlandishly funny, off-the-wall comedy RAISING ARIZONA, and the more serious black comedy AMERICAN BEAUTY - and it didn't work. What they ended up with was a quirky and weird little film that is fairly entertaining but not particularly funny. I think Hollywood is so enthralled with their own quirkiness and weirdness that they interpret anything quirky and weird as being funny and great entertainment. Now, I like quirky, but I draw the line at weird.<br /><br />What could have been a good story about false values - dividing the world between winners and losers, with child beauty pageants as the example of that idea taken to extremes - ended up getting lost in all the quirkiness and weirdness, time constraints and budget limitations. You know something is wrong when the directors don't know how to end the film. They have four different endings on the DVD, none of them what scriptwriter Michael Arndt had in mind, and none of them good. Some are downright lame. The fact that this film won at Sundance does not make it a great film. Other films have won in the past and gone on to obscurity, among them SPITFIRE GRILL, which in 1996 got tremendous praise but today very few people have even heard of.<br /><br />When films like this get raised to the status of Best Picture Nominee, you know the year was not a particularly good one.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

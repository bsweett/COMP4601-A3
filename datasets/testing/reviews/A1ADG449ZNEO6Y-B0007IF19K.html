<meta name="summary" content="25 mins. to long"></head><body><p>I'm always into biography type movies and this one was pretty good.It was just 25 mins to long for me.They could have cut anice chop of the dryness.Jamie Foxx , does look like Ray Charles.He does a very good job acting , but I wouldn't buy this movie.It's actually worth 4 stars but I didn't give it to Ray because of the extra minutes of nothingness</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This movie could have been a big big hit....but did'nt ....."></head><body><p>When you make a remake and you have a big budget, most of the time it<br />will be equal or better than the original. They had the chance in this<br />one..and almost made it.<br />What kind of producers /director/budget maker made the decision to base<br />the whose success of the movie on the emotional final scenes that really did not work well...i really did'nt believe the emotions that were getting portrayed on screen by the kid at all..in fact i found him annoying and not believable...<br />What a bunch of turkeys...and who made the decision to not have a great ending with special effects that blows your mind as the earth is saved and lots of things should have happen and did'nt....poof !!! its over...thanks for your admission...<br /><br />I still like the movie for what it is.. ill keep it with the original.</p></body></html>

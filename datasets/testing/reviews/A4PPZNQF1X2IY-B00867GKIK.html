<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding!  UP charts its own course (ooops!)"></head><body><p>A joyous movie that has a tenderly unexpected start.  The movie moves in its own direction with confidence and persuasiveness.  The story floats along (yes, a pun)with in your face humor and a quirky melancholy, lighting coated.  The movie perfectly balances modern computer graphics with sentimental decour/themes from the 1950s and prior.  Screentime nicely balanced between the two main protangonists, their animal co-padres, and the icon turned villain. Disney did a fine job undermarketing the movie and letting the mystery of the unconventional story unravel itself secretly before contented audience.  One of the year's best.</p></body></html>

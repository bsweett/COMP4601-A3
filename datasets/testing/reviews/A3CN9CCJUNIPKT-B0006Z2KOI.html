Real art.  The script -- which tells the idealized story of a continent-spanning, soul-transforming road trip taken by a young Ernesto "Fuser" Guevara (later to be known as "Che") -- is a masterpiece of understatement and economy, and the acting is uniformly terrific.  I honestly don't think there is a single weak link anywhere to be found in this film: other than the arguably simplistic portrayal of a potent historical character, this is as perfect a movie as you'll ever see.  Plus, to take on the task of presenting such as iconic figure as Guevara, whose historical legacy has an almost unparalelled importance to all of Latin America, is such a daunting task, and Salles does it so well.  It's really impressive.  What more can I say, other that to insist that you have to see this in the full, widescreen edition -- it would be criminal to miss out on the proper framing of such beautiful camera work.</p></body></html>

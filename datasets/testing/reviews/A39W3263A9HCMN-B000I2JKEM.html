<meta name="summary" content="Excellent look at the deceased"></head><body><p>I went to see this on saturday. It was great! (despite a noisy crowd.) It was cold and rainy  so it was a perfect day for the movies.<br /><br />This is about a poor young man named Victor. He lives with his Victoria (which BTW is my sis's name). One day he ruins a rehearsal for the wedding, so he runs out into the forest and accedentaly puts the ring on the finger of a young corpse named Emily, which he thinks is a twig. Then, he is taken to the underworld where he meets other creatures such as Mr. Bonejangles and the black widow.<br /><br />I loved it! evry bit as good as TNBC, and TB is an excellent director. You'll love it!<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />0/1 found my review helpful. WHY????????? My review was short but you don't have to hate it becuz of that.</p></body></html>

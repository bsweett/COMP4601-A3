<meta name="summary" content="Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock need to make more movies together"></head><body><p>I can't understand why Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock haven't made more movies together, because their chemistry is excellent. It worked in "Speed" and it works here in "The Lake House." Very different genres of movies but chemistry is chemistry. You either have it or you don't. And what's more, Reeves and Bullock pull it off even while spending the majority of the movie apart and only talking (well, writing) to each other.<br /><br />I found "The Lake House" to be a refreshing, unconventional (in a good way) and enjoyable film despite its implausible premise. But the focused script and good directing carry it through. Sandra Bullock is great as usual, enough said. Keanu Reeves (ghasp!) actually manages a good performance too, yes, showing *emotion*. Who would have thought he had it in him after all. I've always been a fan of his anyway, but I can say objectively this is by far his best performance (with "My Own Private Idaho" coming in second-another film to watch if you want to see Keanu Reeves demonstrate what he's capable of).<br /><br />I do have a couple of issues with "The Lake House," as much as I liked it. One, the premise is just too far-fetched, no matter how much I wanted to just "go along with it." The holes in the plot are simply too obvious to be overlooked, and this isn't necessarily the fault of anyone; it's only inevitable with this type of story. And two, I found the ending way too feel-good "Hollywood" for my taste. So for these reasons I must lower my review to 4 stars.<br /><br />Still, I would highly recommend this film. It's certainly loads better than the usual for-the-masses-factory-assembly-line crap out there. Despite its flaws, "The Lake House" has a charm that works. And for you heartless folks out there who won't like it, you'll at least appreciate Keanu Reeves' ingenious way of keeping his beer cold! (gotta see the movie to know what I'm talking about).</p></body></html>

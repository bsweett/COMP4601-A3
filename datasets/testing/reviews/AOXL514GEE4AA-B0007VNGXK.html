Blu ray review"></head><body><p>Based on the comics created by Mike Mignola and directed by fan and filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro. The movie begins with Hellboy's origins of how he was brought to earth in the 1940's via a thwarted Nazi occult experiment. He is thus raised as a warrior for good in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.  The B.P.R.D. also sports an amphibious telepath (Abe) and a pyrokinetic (Liz). Together they must take down the very same villains that brought Hellboy to Earth. Led by Rasputin, they seek to bring back the evil god Ogdru Jahad and the end of the world!<br /><br />Hellboy is great fun. Fans of the comics will love this adaptation as well! There's a new hero in town and he's BIG and RED!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Stunning picture and sound. My 50' HD plasma was filled with great darks and colors! A must own Blu Ray. Many of the special features from the 3 disc director's cut are carried over. Unfortunately the cast commentary is gone. FINAL THOUGHTS: It would be a BIG RED mistake not to upgrade! UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></body></html>

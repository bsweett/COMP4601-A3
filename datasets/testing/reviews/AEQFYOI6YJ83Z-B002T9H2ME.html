<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful, eloquent film anchored by a great performance."></head><body><p>This is Sam Rockwell's film, make no mistake of it.  There is rarely ever anyone else on-screen, and his role is complicated enough that he has to run the gamut of emotions in a very short frame of time.  I can think of very few actors who can pull off this performance, and Rockwell is at the top of that list.  Duncan Jones's directing is superb, and Nathan Parker's screenplay is almost flawless, but without Rockwell, this film would merely be a well-thought, intellectual mess.<br /><br />Rockwell plays Sam bell, an astronaut approaching the end of his three-year solo term on the moon.  The time's been getting to him, however; he's been all alone except for the company of a robotic construction (voiced by Kevin Spacey, and his voice is so perfect for the role, one wonders how he hasn't done this before).  Sam begins seeing things...and then he's involved in an accident, and when he comes to, things just aren't the same.  To say more would be to ruin the experience.  And yet, here's the great thing about MOON: it's not one of those twist-based sci-fi films.  There is a twist, but it comes relatively early in the film, and the rest of the movie builds upon it, layering characterization on top of plot.  This is a character study, a thoughtful science fiction film in the vein of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (which is a far superior film, of course; but if you hated that movie, you probably won't like MOON, either).  This isn't a movie for action buffs, or alien-based sci-fi films; MOON is for people who like their science fiction with some depth and emotional resonance.  And if you're just a fan of acting--check out Rockwell.  His performance is worth the price of admission alone.</p></body></html>

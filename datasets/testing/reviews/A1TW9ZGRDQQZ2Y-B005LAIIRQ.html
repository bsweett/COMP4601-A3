Movies about people surviving out in the wilderness have always interested me.<br /><br />The cast was believable (Liam Neeson at his best), they filmed on location (you can almost feel the cold), and it dove into deeper issues than just surviving a large pack of wolves. This film is like a horror and action film rolled into one. The wolf attacks are almost horror movie gory.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the open ending, which I liked, but if you stay after the end credits you get about a 5 second look at the aftermath.<br /><br />For a January release, The Grey is much more of a high calibur film than I expected.</p></body></html>

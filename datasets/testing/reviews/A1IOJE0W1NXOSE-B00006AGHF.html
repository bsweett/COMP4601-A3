<meta name="summary" content="An interesting morality play"></head><body><p>Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson play two men who meet by chance during a traffic accident.  Both are in a hurry to get to a courtroom, Affleck for a business matter and Jackson, to try to get custody of his two boys.  Affleck leaves Jackson stranded at the scene of the accident, not knowing that he has left him with a crucial file.  Jackson arrives at the courthouse too late to plead his case and thus a vendetta begins.  The men play a life-or-death chess match, each striking at the other's weaknesses in order to gain an advantage.  The feud continues on a downward spiral until jobs, wives, homes, and lives are threatened.  The viewer is forced to examine himself and ask what he would do in a similar situation.  The answers are not easy or comfortable.  This is an excellent movie, a morality play that asks the question--does the end justify the means?</p></body></html>

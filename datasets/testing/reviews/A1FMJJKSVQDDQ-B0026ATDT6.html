Some believe it to be one of the greatest foreign films in recent years, while others see it as one of the most influential monster movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I found this movie to be very mediocre. I didn't find the politics in the film distracting (the satire is pretty sharp here), but I did find the tone of the film very confusing. It tries to be a monster movie, a political thriller, a comedy, a family sitcom, and a drama all at the same time. It doesn't work here: these genres are all over the place, and it's a very unbalanced result. I did care about the characters, because they are really ordinary people like us. They act like how would really act when we come face to face with a dangerous beast. But the big problem here is when the young girl is kidnapped by the monster, and that was not a good idea. This plot thread has been recycled so many times in thrillers, action adventures, and horror flicks. And when it's used here, it feels very tired and uninteresting. The CGI effects of the monster itself look very realistic, and the monster itself looks really unique and threatening at times. It's proof that not ever monster has to be very gigantic like Godzilla. The best parts of the film occur in both the beginning and ending. Both are intense and dramatically powerful. Overall, I would like to have given this film at least four stars, but seeing how the story is a bit pretentious (and the tone of the film being unbalanced) it leaves me no choice but to bring it down a notch. I honestly didn't like the film very much, but it still kept my interest until the end.<br /><br />Grade: C-</p></body></html>

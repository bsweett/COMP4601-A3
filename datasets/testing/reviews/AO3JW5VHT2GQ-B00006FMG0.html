When Michael Jr. follows his dad to a job to find out what it is his dad does, he is caught by his dad and his dad's boss's son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig (I)), who is the heir to John Rooney's (Paul Newman) fortune.  To cover his tracks, and perhaps out of jealousy, Connor tries to get Michael Senior killed while he kills the rest of the family, including Michael Jr.  But Michael senior catches on to the plot and gets away while Michael Jr. doesn't happen to be home when Connor makes his hit, killing instead Michael senior's wife and other son Peter.  Michael Senior is smart enough to know that he has to skip town, but he also has to avenge his wife's death by killing Connor.  So, the two Sullivan's leave but another hitman, Maguire (Jude Law), is sent to kill them.  Michael Senior tries to bait the Chicago mob bosses to give up Connor Rooney by stealing their money but it doesn't work.  Eventually he realizes that the only way to kill Connor is to kill Connor's dad, John, so the Chicago mob bosses will stop protecting Connor.  Michael Senior avenges the murders and gets away only to end up with Maguire still hunting him.<p>My Comments:<br />This is a remarkable movie.  The acting is superb.  The music is impeccable.  The cinematography is stunning.  It is just an all around wonderful movie.  There is one scene in particular that was just so well done that I'm still amazed.  It is when Michael Senior kills John Rooney.  John and his henchman are crossing the street in a torrential downpour when Michael opens fire.  Instead of hearing both the rain, the gun shots, and the sounds of dying men, all we hear is music as Michael, in slow motion, kills five or six of John Rooney's henchman.  It isn't until John is the only one left standing that the actual sound comes back up and then, when Michael finally kills John, we hear everything.  <p>I was thoroughly impressed with the story.  It seemed completely logical and plausible and worked very well.  The movie was tasteful enough not to show gratuitous violence.  Sure, the movie is violent, but there is really no reason to show a lot of it, leaving most of the violence to the audience's imagination.  The focus is the story.  And, the setup to the story is superb.  Michael Jr. is telling the story in retrospect, and discussing whether or not his father, who was a hitman for the mob, was a good man or not.  In the end, Michael Jr. doesn't say whether or not his dad was a good man, that is left up to the viewer to decide, but he does claim him as his dad, which says plenty.<p>Overall, I loved this movie.  If you don't particularly care for violence or are not interested in the mafia, then you may not like this movie as much as I did.  But, you'll probably still be entranced by a very compelling and touching story.  A definite must see.</p></body></html>

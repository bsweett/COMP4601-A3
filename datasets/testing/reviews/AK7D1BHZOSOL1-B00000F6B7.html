Kirk and his old enemy Khan butt heads over a device that can create planets called "Genesis".  The only part I didn't like was when Dr. McCoy got all religious about the creation of planets.  I know that he is a country doctor and that this is the point, but I just don't think it adds to the character.  I only write this review knowing that if you don't know this already you are not a Star Trek fan.  If this is the case I urge you to reconsider this movie is wonderful strictly for its entertainment value.</p></body></html>

Taking place in 1891, this is a remake of the original Lon Chaney Jr. film with some exceptions and plot differences.  Benicio Del Toro plays Lawrence Talbot, an actor, returning to his families mansion  in England to investigate the brutal death of his brother (that we see in the first scene in the film.)  Needless to say, this doesn't turn out to ba a great idea in the end.<br />My favorite aspect of this film is the sense of atmosphere.  The mansion where his eccentric father (Anthony Hopkins) lives is properly gloomy and cobweb encrusted and the forest mist-covered and freightening.  There are several very violent attack scenes, particularly one great sequence of the werewolf running amok in London.  Del Toro seems to be sleepwalking throughout most of the film although, to be honest, perhaps thats the way the director wanted him to portray this sad and disturbed character. (Del Toro talks about how badly he wanted to make this film and play this role on one of the retrospectives on the making of the film.)  Hopkins chews the scenery as his crazed father and Emily Blunt is properly lovely as his dead brother's fiancee with whom Del Toro falls in love.<br />There are many extras including deleted and extended scenes.  There are 2 alternate endings.  (After watching them, one can see why they were not used.)  There is much more "Making of" material including a segment on Rick Baker, who produced the amazing transformation scenes.  Baker won an Oscar during the '80s for his legendary transformation scene of another werewolf film: "An American Werewolf in London."<br />This film did not do well during its release earlier in the year.  As stated, I enjoyed it but I enjoyed the unrated version even more which runs almost 20 minutes longer.<br />If you want to see a wildly bloody and violent remake of a classic film, this film is for you.  Like The Wolfman himself, it probably deserved a better fate.</p></body></html>

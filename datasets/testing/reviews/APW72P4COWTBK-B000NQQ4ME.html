<meta name="summary" content="The remake of The Naked Prey!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is the exact same thing of the 1965 movie The Naked Prey. I said that this is the remake because it has the same action scenes and the same concept but on this movie instead of african tribes theses are mayans.<br /><br />Like The Naked Prey this movie is action-packed, it has a beautiful cinematography, great acting, foreing language and violence and bloodshed.<br /><br />Of course the story of Naked Prey is different because is about this hunter that goes to Africa to hunt down some elephants but then he gets caught by a cannibal native tribe, when he escape from the tribe he realize that he is now the prey of humans. Just like in this movie.<br /><br />When you see The Naked Prey you realize about the little differences but is basically the is the EXACT same thing!!! And let's not forget that this is not the first time that this ever happened! The Last Samurai in 2003 and The Departed in 2006 were also remakes of previous movies.<br /><br />P.S: This movie is very violent (even more than Naked Prey) so I can say that this movie is FREAKING COOOL!!!! YEEEAH!<br /><br />Adios.</p></body></html>

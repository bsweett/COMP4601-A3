I liked it very much.  Denzel Washington was on top of his game in this film.  So was Gary Oldman.  This movie also stars Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals.<br /><br />I'll briefly sum up the plot like this:  It is a post-apocalytic world.  Thirty years earlier the apocalytic event took place.  A man named Eli (Denzel Washington) has in his possession the last remaining King James version of the Bible in the world.  Yes, that's right.  He's a wandering nomad who's on a mission to deliver the Bible to a safe haven in the western part of the U.S.  He travels on foot.  It turns out that Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay ends up being the safe haven.  Along the way to San Francisco, Eli encounters a lot of danger from thieves.  He defeats his adversaries quite easily with his great fighting skills.  He also shows great survival skills.  Eli runs into Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a man who is hell bent on obtaining the Bible.  Carnegie's blind concubine named Claudia (Jennifer Beals) gives Eli water and some food.  Carnegie's daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) finds out Eli has some kind of book in his possession, but she doesn't know what the book is.  When Carnegie asks her what kind of book it is, she just indicates that there is a cross symbol on the cover.  Carnegie realizes it's a Bible.  Eli and his company seek a safe haven in a house, where the residents, Martha (Frances de la Tour) and George (Michael Gambon) are armed and ready at all times.  After an ambush of the house, Carnegie gets possession of the Bible by forcing Eli to hand it over.  Eli gets shot at one point, but continues on as if he isn't hurt very much.  To further sum it up, Eli makes it to Alcatraz and recites the entire Bible from memory.  Carnegie has the actual book.  Carnegie opens up the book and discovers it's written in braille because Eli, as it turns out, is blind.  Claudia (who is blind) refuses to read it to him.  After Eli is done reciting the Bible from memory, he expires from his wounds.  Solara walks home instead of living at Alcatraz.<br /><br />Some things in this movie are quite unbelievable, such as how a blind man can fight and kill people, how there's only one Bible left in the world (even though it was stated in the movie that all the Bibles were burned).  You mean there's not a spare copy lying around somewhere on planet Earth?  But.........the whole point of this movie is to show how the power of the Bible and faith can protect a person from danger and empower them (if you believe in it, of course).<br /><br />Overall, it's a good action movie that's quite moving.  I recommend it.</p></body></html>

Cash became the iconic half of Johnny Cash and June Cater Cash.  It's a story with the ups and downs we've all come to expect from a celebrity bio - the talented artist finds himself trying to deal with family trauma and dysfunction, has bad brushes with substance abuse and is ultimately redeemed by love to become the icon that he's remembered for.  Johnny's start was a precarious one - he sounded horrible until he could learn to channel his past into his music.  The story informs Cash's rise during run-ins with Elvis & Jerry Lee Lewis.  He courts the lovely June Carter.  The Carters are already celebrities in Country music before Cash enters the scene, yet they're down-to-earth, and probably more sympathetic to Cash than June is.  (They get one of the funniest scenes in the movie when, while still June still remains unmarried to Johnny, they giveCash's drug supplier the double-barrel brush off.)  Joaquin Phoenix doesn't quite look like Cash, but he goes the distance when it comes to capturing Cash's talent for injecting gobs of angry and funny energy into his bottomless baritone.  This is best displayed when Phoenix kicks off his show at Fulsom Pen - creating the now historic concert album - with "Cocaine Blues"; Phoenix plays Cash like a demon, a performance alone that should have netted him an Oscar (he lost to Hoffman for "Capote").  Robert Patrick is a surprise with the unenviable job of Cash's father - a stiff and unartistic soul who nevertheless managed to escape alcoholism, yet seems unwilling to help his son out of his own substance abuse problem.<br /><br />In short, it's funny and sad - something that most celeb bios shoot for, but few achieve.  Even if the script seems to lag, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the day.  If anything, you can watch this disc, just to hear them play.</p></body></html>

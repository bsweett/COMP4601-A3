<meta name="summary" content="Fun Romantic Comedy - Yasou!"></head><body><p>My Big Fat Greek Wedding was quite the romantic comedy and yet was disappointing in other areas.<br /><br />We have a nerdy, unkempt daughter of a Greek man [Nia Vardalos, who also wrote the screenplay] with a massive personality and belonging to a large Greek family.  She never fit in and rejected what was expected of her (marry Greek, have lots of Greek kids, be a mom) but seemed to blame it all on her family.<br /><br />Her family is quirky to say the least.  They're loud, happy and excitable.  She is so "not that" that she is introverted and unhappy most of the time.  She feels trapped and no way out.<br /><br />This part of the story was a bit annoying to me.  I too am Greek and have a large family but we never embraced the traditions of a Greek family as the main character does.  If anything I think I would have enjoyed going to Greek school.<br /><br />Finally she realizes that she can do something about it and goes to college to learn computers (over her father's objections) and gets a job at her aunt's travel agency and makes it work.<br /><br />At the same time she is completely frozen by the entrance of a man in her life.  He's not Greek, her father rejects him, but she falls completely in love and can't help herself.<br /><br />The plot is a bit predictable at this point with the man doing whatever he can to ingratiate himself into her big Greek family.  He on the other hand has a small, quiet family and his parents have a rough time with them - they want a country club wedding, quiet with a few guests - what they get is a big party!<br /><br />Most of the humor comes from the clash of cultures (spitting on someone for good luck --- I have to try that on my family, LOL) and of the woman realizing that she need not be ashamed of her heritage and completely reject it - that she can accept her big Greek family and be independent at the same time.<br /><br />It all works.  Recommended, especially if you have a wild and crazy southern European family.  According to Wiki, this was the highest grossing romantic comedy that never hit big in theaters.<br /><br />Cast!<br /><br />Directed by Joel Zwick<br /><br />Produced by Gary Goetzman<br />Tom Hanks<br />Rita Wilson<br /><br />Written by Nia Vardalos<br /><br />Starring John Corbett<br />Nia Vardalos<br />Lainie Kazan<br />Michael Constantine<br />Ian Gomez<br />Arielle Sugarman<br />Stavroula Logothettis<br />Gia Carides<br />Andrea Martin<br />Louis Mandylor<br />Jayne Eastwood<br /><br />Other Films with Nia Vardalos:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8UO4">My Life in Ruins</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U1LGTQ">I Hate Valentine's Day (Ws)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CGNEF">My Big Fat Greek Life - The Entire Series</a></p></body></html>

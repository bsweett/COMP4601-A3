However, the notion of an open mind has a very vague connotation, which is also the intention of Gilliam.  After examination of Gilliam's previous work it is evident that his visual manifestations have a bizarre and even unearthly tone to them.  It is with innovating imagination that Gilliam applies his artistry to the silver screen, as his creations are often fantastic in nature with a strong touch of cognitive dissonance.  Within the conflicting concepts, Gilliam allows the viewer to cerebrally struggle with one or multiple ideas, which presents some of his ingenious cinematic dexterity.  On occasion, his visions can feel a little tangled, and leave the viewer slightly disoriented.<br /><br />In many aspects, Gilliam is a pioneering artist that requires artistic freedom when he plunges into his passion.  It also means that when his creation is finished it does not always allow the audience to grasp his intentions, as his thoughts on the screen do not easily transfer to the mind of the audience.  Some of difficulty with Gilliam's films might rest in the audience's inability to surrender themselves to the story.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is one of these stories that might easily vanish among the many Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter's (J.K. Rowling wanted Gilliam to direct her Harry Potter books), and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  These epic fantasy films have serious undertones and strong moral messages while applying fascinating might and magic.  Gilliam uses a different approach, as he always breaks away from the well-traveled road.  In this process, Gilliam attempts to reach an audience that would allow themselves to unlock their tightly secured maturation and let out this inner child.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is not as easy as Gilliam anticipated to let out the child within each adult, as many have deem the story self-indulgent and an immature journey of irresponsibility.  Nonetheless, in Gilliam's free adaptation of the Brothers Grimm remains true to the gruesome violence in the Grimm fairy tales.  Thus, those that state that the story is too violent for children should consider the film in its historical context, as parents, grandparents and other relatives scared the bejesus out of their children to foster certain behaviors centuries ago.<br /><br />One of the traditional characteristics in Gilliam's films is humor, dry and witty with occasional slapstick to soften up the audience.  It might be relic from his days with the Monty Python, yet he is also very well aware of the importance of human laughter and its ability to heal people in pain.  Sometimes I get the feeling that Gilliam feels sorry for those who do not laugh, as he always incorporates some element of humor in his cinematic creations.  Thus, the audience should also be aware of the amusing absurdity in the Brothers Grimm, as the film frequently applies much of this healthy cerebral exercise.<br /><br />The story itself in the Brothers Grimm follows the two Grimm brothers Jacob (Heath Ledger) and Wilhelm (Matt Damon), as they make a living exploiting people's superstition.  Eventually, the law catches up with them, as the Italian torture master Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) arrests them by order of the French General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce).  However, a second chance is given to the Grimm's as they are told to put a stop on the mysterious events in the forest of Marbaden. If they succeed, Delatombe will spare their lives.<br /><br />Once Jacob and Wilhelm arrive to the German village of Marbaden with their eager to kill supervisor Cavaldi, they begin to witness the strange events of the small village.  With the help of the local scout and ranger Angelika (Lena Headey) they enter the woods and to their bewilderment they learn that there indeed exists strange and dangerous creatures heard from fairy tales.  Squeezed between two sides - the imaginary and the real - they soon learn that both sides want them dead.  It is an intriguing symbolical struggle, as imagination faces off with rationalization.  The struggle could also offer an analogy to modern times, as wars do not show sympathy to the people caught in between the fighting parts.<br /><br />Besides the fairy tale, the film presents a myriad of concepts both psychological and social in nature.  For example, the individual construction of beliefs, morals, and values emerge within the story through a childhood trauma experienced by both Jacob and Wilhelm concerning magical beans.  Expansionism and power then go under scrutiny through the character Delatombe and the magical creature in the woods.  Together these ideas offer a criticism of the contemporary society, as it is too rigid and not always understanding of the differences within the many parts of the world.  The intolerance often fueled by greed for power is the film eternal beauty.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is brilliant in several ways, but the profiteering machine of the film industry has blocked its genius in the contrasting light of many other films.  Thus, in comparison with other films, which are a natural act, the true gem within the film dissolves into a trite fantasy adventure.  However, if the viewer allows himself or herself to transcend beyond the ordinary into a world of individuality a sparkling fantasy tale that freely adapts the Grimm's fairytale world emerges.  Lastly, Gilliam's intentions are admirable, but to expect most people to free themselves from their previous experience is also a little too much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT FILM BUT....."></head><body><p>This is one of those films where you feel you're watching the real thing. I loved the way the director shows us the confusion among the traffic controlers and military personel. I also liked the fact they never try to show the passengers as action heroes but instead as regular people reacting the way most of us would have. By the end my stomach was in knots. Only problem with buying this DVD: who would ever want to see this film in a regular basis ? Not me so I'll pass on what I consider 5 star material.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Domestic Disturbance"></head><body><p>It begins so innocently: A young man and a young woman glace at each other and immediately want to close the distance between them and get better acquainted. Such a moment can be found in James Cameron's "Titanic" early in the film, when the characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet first notice each other despite being separated by deck levels and social status. A very similar moment can be found at the beginning of Sam Mendes' "Revolutionary Road," and interestingly, it features the same two actors. Their characters see each other for the first time at a local party, and they're separated more by life goals than by stature. As wonderful as "Titanic" is, it's an escapist entertainment, a sweeping, epic romantic fantasy. "Revolutionary Road" is smaller, subtler, and painfully real. We know this because the youthful, na?ve love the characters share at the start disappears by the next scene, at which point they're already married and having a terrible fight.<br /><br />Based on Richard Yates' novel, "Revolutionary Road" is a brilliant, unflinchingly honest examination of suburban life in 1950s America, where the outward appearance of domestic happiness meant everything to the average married couple. It tells the story of a corporate employee named Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) and his stay-at-home wife, April (Winslet), who live in a picturesque but boring Connecticut neighborhood. Despite the fact that Frank hates his job, he's content to stick with it, knowing that he's expected to provide for his family. This isn't to say that he doesn't let himself go from time to time. Early in the film, he has an affair with a young secretary. The fascinating thing is that both of them seem so casual about what they're doing; if they regret their actions, they certainly don't show it. There isn't even a spark of emotion as he leaves her in a motel bed, asserting that she was swell.<br /><br />April, on the other hand, yearns for something more out of life than just living in a suburb and raising her two children. Years ago, she was an aspiring actress. Now, she's in a domestic trap as a wife and mother. On the night of Frank's thirtieth birthday, she makes a radical suggestion: They should all move to Paris in the fall. Once there, she will get a secretarial job while Frank will be allowed to figure out what he actually wants to do with his life. It takes a little convincing, but Frank agrees, and for a time, his relationship with April improves. But it isn't long before life starts getting in the way. For one thing, absolutely no one takes their plan seriously, especially their neighbors, Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn), who seem genuinely hurt by their wanting to leave. But truth be told, there is something a little phony about the glow that surrounds Frank and April, as if the idea is more appealing than actually moving.<br /><br />There's more holding them back, of course, but I won't say what. I will, however, take the time to describe a subplot featuring another "Titanic" alumnus, Kathy Bates. She plays Helen Givings, the realtor who sold the Wheelers their house on Revolutionary Road. Even though she doesn't have much screen time, it's surprising just how much we learn about her. On the outside, she's polite and upbeat, with a pleasant face and charming smile. On the inside, she's judgmental and, in some ways, just as desperate as April. Her son, John (Michael Shannon), has just been released from a mental hospital, and as part of his rehabilitation, he begins spending time with the Wheelers. In the same way the blind Tiresias is able to see the truth about King Oedipus, John is the only character in "Revolutionary Road" with a firm grasp on Frank and April. But as insightful as he is, there does come a point when the truth really hurts.<br /><br />What I really loved about this movie was the meticulous attention to dialogue. Every line in this movie felt natural, going not for obvious dramatic statements but for realistic outbursts of anger, hurt, and frustration. Even the quieter moments have an intensity all their own, as when Frank sits with the secretary at a restaurant; in that pivotal scene, he expresses--probably for the first time--the disappointment he feels for turning out exactly like his father. At the same time, there's an air of epiphany in his voice, as if he realized right then and there that he was never meant to be anything more than an office worker. Writer Justin Haythe evokes powerful emotions in his screenplay, and he does so without being condescending or clich&eacute;.<br /><br />Of course, well-written screenplays are only half the battle--you need talented actors to make the dialogue work. DiCaprio and Winslet have such believable onscreen chemistry, especially as their characters descend into a seemingly never-ending cycle of shouting matches. They fight so well, as if they were an actual married couple. After having eleven years to mature as performers, they may in fact be better than they were in "Titanic." One wonders what would have happened had the ship made it to America and Jack and Rose had gotten off together. Would the fairy-tale romance eventually end? Would they grow up to be as unfulfilled as Frank and April Wheeler? "Revolutionary Road" is such an amazing film, superbly cast, expertly plotted, and emotionally compelling, a sobering reminder that what we want doesn't always coincide with what we get. Even the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of 2008--like "Changeling," "Gran Torino," and "Frost/Nixon"--are not as good as this film is.</p></body></html>

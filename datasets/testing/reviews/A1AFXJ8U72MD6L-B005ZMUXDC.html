<meta name="summary" content="A NEW TAKE ON RAPUNZEL MYTHOLOGY (sort of)"></head><body><p>Based on the mythological Rapunzel tales which go back even further to the Maiden in the Tower tales (dealing with isolation, emotional captivity and coming of age).  It's an updated version as a fantasy animation comedy/musical with a roguish hero, a spunky heroine and some basic themes about joy and living your dream.  Mandy Moore is the acting and singing voice of Rapunzel and the whole cast is good (even the minor cast) but in some scenes it seems like the evil witch steals many of the scenes with her underhanded psychological abusive attacks on her fake daughter<br />intertwined with a bit of defensive love. The ending would be a bit of a cheat in an adult tale but as this was intended more for kids it works out well enough and nobody becomes traumatized as a result. Heh. Disney fans will appreciate this being its 50th animation. People who want to do more research about this particular mythology can start at Wikipedia and find it at many other online sources. Interesting take on the hair that I've never read about but it wouldn't surprise me if it was in one of the old folk tales. STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; CGI: B to B plus; GAGS/HUMOR: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid August 2011 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.</p></body></html>

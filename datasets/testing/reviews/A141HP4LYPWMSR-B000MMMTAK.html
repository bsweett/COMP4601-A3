<meta name="summary" content="A Jar Of Gypsy Tears ~ Baywatch, Pamela Anderson And My Friend Mr. Jesus"></head><body><p>The Apocalypse must surely be upon us! If the immense popularity of a mock-umentary film like `Borat' ('06) isn't a sign of the impending demise of Western Civilization then I don't know what is. Lewd, crude, demeaning and repulsive are just a few of the words that come to mind when I recall viewing this movie. Oh yes I forgot, not funny. It reminds me of the now defunct `Tom Green Show' that aired on MTV several years ago, it has that same type of documentary style in your face humor with Tom acting weird in public and freaking people out. `Borat' is kind of like Tom Green with an accent. There are a few funny sequences like the gypsy tears bit at a yard sale and the Mr. Jesus material was enjoyable, but the good moments are very few and far between.<br /><br />I've been told that I'm completely missing the point of the movie. It's supposed to be offensive, afterall it's pointing out societal norms and beliefs that are in and of themselves offensive. That's the point. I get the point and I'm not against scathing political or social satire, I just didn't enjoy this attempt.<br /><br />This film is definitely worth seeing ~ NOT!</p></body></html>

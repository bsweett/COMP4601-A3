<meta name="summary" content="Bollywood Meets the Mean Streets of Mumbai"></head><body><p>Danny Boyle certainly knows how to tell a good story as he weaves together an entertaining yarn of growing up hard in Mumbai.  He builds the plot around "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" using the questions to reveal Jamal's hard life, as the chaiwalla seems to know all the right answers much to the chagrin of the host, Prem Kumar.<br /><br />It takes a little while to get on track but Boyle and Loveleen Tandan never lose sight of their characters, charting a course that has a number of amazing twists and turns.  While Jamal never gives up his pursuit for the lovely Latika, his older brother Salim is the one who figures out how to get them out of one jam after another, but not always to Jamal's liking.  Some of the scenes are pretty harrowing, as one would expect from being forced to live on the street after Jamal's and Salim's mother is beaten to death in a race riot, but ultimately Boyle keeps to the spirit of Bollywood moreso than Dickens.<br /><br />The cast is an intriguing mix of first-time actors and Bollywood stars, as fantasy meets reality.  I can see why the movie is such a favorite among audiences. One would have to be pretty callous not to give into the kinetic energy of the movie, and let yourself be taken along on this wild ride.  The movie is loosely based on the bestselling book Q & A by Vikas Swarup.</p></body></html>

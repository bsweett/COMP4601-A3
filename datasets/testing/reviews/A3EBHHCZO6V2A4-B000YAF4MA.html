<meta name="summary" content="Kicking the Bucket"></head><body><p>"The Bucket List" can be best summed up as "Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman pose for green screen postcards." Freeman and Nicholson open the movie enjoying their favorite vices;for Freeman,it's a cigarette,while Nicholson drinks in the scent of rare coffee. Both are stricken with cancer. They find themselves in the same cancer ward.<br /><br />Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) suffers from lung cancer,as if it's divine retribution. He's surrounded by his devoted family. Alone, gazillionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) suffers from brain cancer. Rob Morrow,the policeman from CBS' "Numbers",stars as his joking doctor. Both Cole and Chambers learn they have only a year to live, so they live it up. There's TONS of exposition looong before they go on their Epic Journey.<br /><br />With green screens as their backdrop, Cole and Chambers enjoy skydiving, racing on the Great Wall of China, seeing the Taj Mahal and the pyramids of Egypt. (Why not Junction City,Oregon,home of the Scandinavian Festival,or Hobbiton USA in the Northern California redwoods?) It's very cliched.<br /><br />"Bucket List" is,despite the leading actors' talents,and Freeman's omnipresent narration,deadly dull.</p></body></html>

The worst thing about the movie is that it drags too often. I can stand a few slow spots, but it occurs frequently in the movie. What saves the movie from being a complete bore are the few scenes that are absolutely hilarious! When it's funny, it's really funny. Nick Frost, once again, does a great job at playing the bumbling side kick who has an obsession with Action movies (particularly Point Break). Simon plays his character dead serious, as the character is ment to be played, but it makes the character not interesting. Overall, an average movie. It just leaves me wishing it was better than it was.</p></body></html>

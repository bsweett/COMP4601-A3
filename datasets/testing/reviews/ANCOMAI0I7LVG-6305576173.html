<meta name="summary" content="Quite possibly the greatest comedy of all time; and I'm not lying..."></head><body><p>Quite honestly one of the greatest comedies ever filmed, `Young Frankenstein' is a marvel of cinema and a treasure for every film library.  The film sports some hilarious performances, iconic at that, not to mention a tightly woven script with jokes that actually land; all of which come together beautifully to create an extremely memorable comedic experience.  It's rare for me to find a comedy that covers every base.  As much as I enjoy a good comedy I often refer to dramatic films when speaking of `the best of film' but I would be a liar if I said that `Young Frankenstein' isn't one of the greatest `movies' ever made, let alone comedies.<br /><br />The film follows the grandson of Dr. Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein, as he inherits his grandfather's castle.  Frankenstein has spent his entire life trying to live down the reputation of his experimental grandfather but he soon finds himself falling into his granddads footsteps.  Equipped with a hunchbacked sidekick Igor, the beautiful Inga and the mysterious Frau Blucher, Frankenstein makes his own attempt at creating life from death, with some disastrous (not to mention hilarious) consequences.<br /><br />Gene Wilder was one hilarious actor.  I love his character creations, Frederick Frankenstein resting right up there with Willy Wonka for me.  He truly shines here, it's no wonder he considered this his favorite of all the films he made.  Marty Feldman steals this film though as Igor.  His performance is comedic genius.  The way he always manages to steal the limelight in the scene, becoming the focal point of our attention due to his marvelous comedic timing.  Teri Garr is also right on point and effortlessly captivating, but she can't hold a candle to Cloris Leachman or Madeline Kahn who are both uproarious here; especially Leachman (that whole violin scene leaves me in stitches every time).<br /><br />We cannot leave out the late, great, Peter Boyle who dominates this film as the monster.  He makes him human, yes, but more importantly he makes him funny.  That whole `Puttin on the Ritz' scene (arguably the best scene in the film) is precisely the reason why this film is a `must see-must own' staple for any lover of film.<br /><br />Mel Brooks was known for his comedies, many of which are considered classics and are adored by many.  In my humble opinion, this is his finest film.  It gets everything right, and that is a rare treat indeed.  There is not a dry spot found here, each and every gag landing right where it is supposed to (word is that for every joke that landed there were two or three that fell flat so there was a massive editing procedure done to save the film and deliver this finely polished finished product).<br /><br />There are plenty of spoofs out there today, films that take something classic and tear it to shreds in an effort to elicit some laughs.  Sadly many of them fall flat.  `Young Frankenstein' is the film that they should all aspire to be because it is the one film that actually manages to deliver a unique and memorable experience without tarnishing the good name of the original.  Yes, `Young Frankenstein' draws all of its humor from cracking fun at Mary Shelley's classic, but this film manages to become its own film, separate from its inspiration and thus earning its very own place in our hearts.<br /><br />There are few films that I could sit and watch time and time again.  This is right at the top of that very short list.</p></body></html>

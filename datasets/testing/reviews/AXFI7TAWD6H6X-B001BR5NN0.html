<meta name="summary" content="A good representative of teen life in the '80s"></head><body><p>Of all the John Hughes films I have seen "The Breakfast Club" is probably my least favorite but only because I have seen this movie so many times on basic cable on Saturday mornings. Nevertheless the movie isn't bad as I make it out to sound. I grew up in the '80s and on John Hughes' films. I thought his coming of age teenage flicks like "Pretty in Pink", "Sixteen Candles", and "The Breakfast Club" at the time represented the lives of teenagers. That was almost twenty years ago and teenagers today are more angst-ridden and are dealing with a lot more serious problems. There really isn't much of plot in "The Breakfast Club". It simply revolves around a circle of high school students who end up getting detention and are forced to serve it on a Saturday morning. There is the jock Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), the rebel John Bender (Judd Nelson), popular girl Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the outcast Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), and the geek Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall). Principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) has his students in the library which forces them to talk to each other. Although it appears that they are different, the five students eventually realize that they really are not all that different despite the fact they come from different backgrounds and hang out with different crews. My favorite moment in the film were the more dramatic scenes when each character are forced to evaluate themselves. I also liked it when everyone tries to escape the library and get out of detention. Paul Gleason as principal Richard Vernon was the ideal antagonist for the five lead characters. He was pretty funny. Although I have seen this movie so many times and am pretty tired of it, I still like "The Breakfast Club".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great dialogue, if you can understand it"></head><body><p>Of all the film genres, action and action comedies are where films by foreign directors have reached the quality of films by US directors.  It used to be that the best action movies and action comedies had names like Lucas, Spielberg, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola attached to it.  No more.  Now the top action and action-comedies are often made by Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo del Toro, Peter Jackson and other non-US directors.  This is probably most epitomized in the field of crime-action-comedy.  American films of this class has degenerated into rehashes of franchises such as Die Hard, Terminator, and Bad Boys, with over-the-top special effects, forgettable soundtracks, and bad dialogue.  England, on the other hand, is producing 1 or 2 great urban crime comedies annually.  It all started with this production from the pairing of Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn, Snatch.  Taking a look at the criminal underworld of the UK, we see splices from the world of gambling, money laundering, illegal fights, pawnshops, and the black market trade in jewels.  The movie populates this world with a collection of characters of varying dryness and sarcasm, all trying to outwit the other while staying alive.  Yes there are gunfights, but they are few and far between, and like real gunfights, and unlike those featured in US-made movies; almost everyone gets hit.  What carries the movie is the dialogue, and seeing how the different characters talk down, or up, or to each other; profanity or no profanity.  This ranges from Brad Pitt's take of a Irish vagrant to a Jason Statham's personification of an exasperated middleman caught between a rock and a hard place.  All of it is well-crafted and speaks to the script-writing underlying this movie.  Overall, well worth the watch.</p></body></html>

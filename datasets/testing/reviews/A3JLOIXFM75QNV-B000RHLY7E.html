<meta name="summary" content="Why is this called a horror film?"></head><body><p>I've noticed that most people are claiming this is a horror movie. I just don't see it. Is it sort of sick and twisted, yes. But scary, no way, unless you are 10 years old... Most of the film is boring and forgettable. I even found the characters to be uninteresting. Its nothing that I havent seen before. Nothing new or innovative or cringe-worthy. No awesome payoff at the end. Just a waste of time really.</p></body></html>

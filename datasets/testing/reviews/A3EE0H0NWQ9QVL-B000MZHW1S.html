Skillfully intersecting the lives of three key figures, we get more than a soap box lecture from the liberal left.  Hardly preachy, the movie has natural developments and dialogue that are organic to the story and its delivery.  Some of the heart-stopping violence and the tender timeouts are testaments to fine timing and storytelling.  Meaningful throughout, we witness how greed and violence scar the lives and landscape of developing Africa.  However, the film would be a worthy experience even if it didn't have a message.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays a jaundiced diamond bounty hunter, Danny Archer, mentored by the military prowess of a commanding colonel since his late teens.  Despite the fact that his longevity should earn him fringe benefits, he gets an assignment meant to patch up a recently botched effort.  To get what he wants, he crosses the path of refugee, Solomon Venge (Djimon Hounsou), who is trying to reunite his family after sectarian violence has split them apart.  Solomon has found and hidden a huge rough diamond in the middle of his forced labor at a rebel camp, which Archer could use as the payback acquisition.  In the middle is liberal reporter, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly), who wants to make a difference in the region more than win a Pulizer Prize.  Archer meets her and finds she can assist him with reuniting Solomon's family.  For her part, she needs the inside scoop of the black market diamond trade.  She knows about greedy agents, like Archer, are trading arms for diamonds to fund the rebels' side of the civil war, but she needs proof.  It's a complex, yet captivating trade.  In between these developments, we see Solomon's own son being indoctrinated and taught (among many) to fight with submachine guns for the rebel forces.<br /><br />`Blood Diamond' may not always surprise, but it is filled with riveting adventure and harrowing battle scenes.  Urgent situations, anguishing details, and a connected plot construct a solid movie experience.  Pointedly, the film is meaningful.  The movie makes expert connections from the battles to the diamond trade to the jewelry store.  It also aligns the characters well.  In one emotional scene Archer and Bowen talk about his past, and we discover that he was made an orphan at an early age after civil war atrocities killed his parents.  Sometimes a few coincidences play too neatly into the hand of circumstance, but the exploitation and compelling chase scenes are presented genuinely enough.  DiCaprio's worthy Oscar nomination and fine supporting performances add to the cohesive story.  Even some of the cinematography is breathtaking enough to keep from taking the Third World for granted.  More than `Rambo' for liberals, `Blood Diamond' is a thoughtful and well-crafted movie experience with an important story to tell.</p></body></html>

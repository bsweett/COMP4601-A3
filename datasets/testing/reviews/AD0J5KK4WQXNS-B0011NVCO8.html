<meta name="summary" content="The rise and fall of the black mafia"></head><body><p>Scott's latest foray is about the coming to power of the black mafia in America and how it effectively put the Italian mafia into their lap because they could smuggle cheap and high grade herion out of Vietnam during the war.<br /><br />Denzil Washington plays, Frank Lucas, the gangster who made it all happen. Russell Crowe is Det. Richie Roberts a Jewish straight cop whose honesty makes his department look bad. Roberts is assigned to bust drug barons while Lucas remains low-profile and takes control of Manhattan block by block.<br /><br />As far as gangster movies go this is no Scorsese, however it is a very good drama and there is a substantial twist in the end that makes it worth while. One could hope that there would have been more screen time between Lucas and Crowe (they only meet in the last few minutes) but even apart they still hold their own. This isn't just a story about the rise and fall of the black mafia though. There is something else lurking in the background but that really is the ace card that is lurking up Scott's sleeve. By all means do watch American Gangsters but don't expect too much and you may well be watching one of the best dramas of 2008.</p></body></html>

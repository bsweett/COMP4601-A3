He takes the money and leaves, but his conscience gets the better of him and he returns for the Mexican the next day, where he's promptly ambushed by gunmen and barely escapes alive. A complex chain of events is started: a serial killer hired by a businessman is ordered to recover the stolen money, and the local sheriff is also in on the hunter's trail in order to solve the crime. This has been getting fantastic reviews Stateside, and is being hotly tipped as a major Oscar contender.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disposing of things that go BOOM"></head><body><p>This is an independent film, and as such it has a unique flavor to it that you're not bound to find in anything coming out of mainstream Hollywood.  To me, that's a good thing!  The story is about one of the most unconventional of soldiers:  the EOD expert (better known in the civilian world as the "bomb squad guy").<br /><br />The movie has more of a feel of a documentary than it does a movie that has a linear plot.  The main character is an amazingly competent diffuser of bombs, but is also a person who lacks common sense and social skills.  He is so adept at deactivating bombs, and yet he is clueless about relations with his girlfriend, and something as banal as shopping for cereal @ the grocery store makes him very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Some may be surprised that this doesn't come off as an anti-war movie like, say,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUJQ">Platoon (Special Edition)</a>.  The veracity of the this film has been criticized by people who are far more qualified to challenge its realism than I am.  That said, I would STILL say that the movie brings the viewer closer to what it feels like to be a soldier in a combat zone than most films.<br /><br />As in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8QG22">Good Morning, Vietnam (Special Edition)</a>, the main character befriends a young boy who is a native of the foreign country.  Some have said this is unrealistic.  I would disagree.  No matter whether the soldiers are EOD specialists, Rangers, Delta Force or whatever, there's a good chance they have strong parental insticts.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that it's many times strong parental instincts are one of the things that drive them to become soldiers in the FIRST place.  They want to leave a better, safer world behind for their family / children.  So, I would contend that the criticisms of this aspect of the movie are unwarranted.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie & would like to experience more Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), then I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470444304">Rage Company: A Marine's Baptism By Fire</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DN5WUW">Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories DVD</a>.</p></body></html>

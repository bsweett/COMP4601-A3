<meta name="summary" content="Watch the Series"></head><body><p>I have to agree with another review I saw here.  This is the best of the Star Trek films.  Still, there are a whole bunch of episodes in the series better than this film.  All Good Things, Tapestry, Q Who, Family, Chain of Command Part 2, Future Imperfect, Elementary Dear Data, The Chase, Who Watches the Watchers, all of these episodes are better than any of the films.  The film is still okay, but it just can't top some of the episodes in the series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding - A Monster Epic The Way It Should Be"></head><body><p>One of the best monster movies ever made - up there with the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H30B2C">King Kong - Extended Cut (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a> - "The Host" is the kind of movie that reminds you why you love movies so much in the first place.  Successfully combining so many of the elements that make filmdom great - an engaging story, tremendous visuals, memorable characters, great thrills and horror, even a surprisingly large dose of humor - this is one for the ages, one that's still going to be vital viewing twenty or fifty years from now.<br /><br />  In Seoul, South Korea, the careless disposal of chemicals from a military base years ago - allegedy harmful-but-common substances like formeldahyde, but you have to wonder if that's really all it was - ends up creating catastrophic consequences in the modern day.  At a busy stretch of coast along the Han River, populated by picnic spots, bustling foodstands and the like, a crowd gathers, abuzz over a strange sight before them: something black, suspended from a large bridge, something that looks alive.  It's not really a good place to gather though, for the strange thing doesn't plan on staying immobile in its nook in the bridge's understructure.<br /><br />  What starts out seeming like a very charming, slice-of-life/comedy movie, takes on a much more serious tone with the monster's first strike.  The main (human) characters of the movie are all of one family.  A 13 year-old girl is one of the first victims in the attack - seemingly.  But when her devastated father receives a cellphone call from his still-alive child, nobody in authority believes his theory: that the monster - which seemingly ate the girl - swallows its 'prey' into some kind of non-digestive department, then returns home and deposits them in its lair.  The little girl is really the one link holding her family together; some of the family members are estranged from one another, but they all love the child, and all make the bold move of attempting to track her down as a group, themselves becoming fugitives from the authorities in the process.  Meanwhile, there are different groups of authorities - both Korean and international - with their own ideas on how to handle the situation, and there are some possible implications in there, not limited to the idea that some parties are more interested in hiding their own negligence than anything else.<br /><br />  Electrifying, heart-stirring and plausibly done, "The Host" succeeds on all counts.  If you haven't yet come into the world of Asian movies, this is a great place to start (and if this Is your first one, you've got a lot of other treats waitin for you!)  I'd recommend viewing this in the subtitled format, the way I saw it.  There's also an English-dubbed option on the disc, but I've heard that it's not a very good dub job.  Either way you watch it though, this really a major must-see, and one of the best movies of the year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Smart isn't so dumb anymore"></head><body><p>I was a big fan of the TV series, back when I was too young to know any better. Well, all the slapstick, goofy stuff, and Maxwell Smart's egotistical pettiness are there, but they've been through the "sensitive male" 1980s, Jenny Craig, high-budget effects and stunts, and I don't know what-all. Going through all that transformed them.<br /><br />I almost split a gut laughing when the discussion turned to the state of her ovaries (Hathaway is a young-looking 26 as of this writing, a fact that needs a little explaining away in the movie, and I assume that they're just fine). Then, when the big, knockdown fight near the end turned into a hugfest, well that was way too Californian for me even though I'm Californian - but only a little, and that will get better real soon I promise.<br /><br />It was all I remembered, but more in every direction - including some mild potty humor and silly edges toward nudity that would never have worked back when the good guys could still smoke. Enough time has passed, and they acknowledge that from the start, that it can all be new again. And it's a hoot.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

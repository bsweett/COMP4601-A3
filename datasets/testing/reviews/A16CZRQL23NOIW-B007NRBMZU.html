Right between your eyes a little twist of the state of the things can make affect an entire life: yours or another one. It's a big puzzle where the lines are intersected by minuscule connections as a whole nervous system: even the maxim disorder has its own pattern. If you wish to turn back any little piece of this complex and unexpected mechanism ruled by capricious laws you can open Pandora's box.<br /><br />How many possible resolutions may an event have? . That's why the history can not accept such coin in this values' market. You rearrange a little detail and the whole destiny changes suddenly before your eyes. It's like make possible scenarios inside an unknown future. You can control and even reduce your weakness and increase your strengths, but the rest of the uncertainness is still dark. What about with the menaces and opportunities: these are variables which live outside your control. You can not handle them.<br /><br />Interesting and very well built script that leaves you thinking: you can not alter a fact to rescue a destiny without avoiding worst or better consequences derived from the best of your goodwill.</p></body></html>

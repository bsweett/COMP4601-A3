THIS IS "DIE HARD!""></head><body><p>Bruce Willis returns as Detective John McClane in "Live Free or Die Hard," the fourth film in the "Die Hard" film franchise! In this film, McClane faces his toughest challenge yet when he takes on a group of cyber-terrorists hell-bent on shutting down the American infrastructure. But 21st Century villains are about to get a taste of 20th Century justice! The film features some fantastic action sequences, and the plot is great, if a tad predictable.<br />As far as acting goes, it's good overall. Willis, as usual, is great as McClane. He maybe a few years older, but he can still unload a can of whoop-#*$ on the bad guys, and is still good with the wise-cracks. Justin Long is also good as Matt Farrell, a computer hacker, and McClane's side-kick in the film. Sadly, Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q, two respectable actors, are given one-dimensional villains to play, though they do the best with what they got to work with. And Kevin Smith makes a memorable, if frustratingly short, appearance as one of Farrell's fellow hackers.<br />This is definitely one of the best films in the series. Despite some flaws, this is a terrific film that "Die Hard" fans will surely enjoy!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-</p></body></html>

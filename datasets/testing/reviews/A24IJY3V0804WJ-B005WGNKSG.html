<meta name="summary" content="A fine adaptation"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the movie although it seemed to be a very abridged version of the book. For starters the character of Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace manages to somewhat convey the intensity and complexity that was part of the persona of Salander. Mikael Blomvist played by Michael Nyqvist is suitable as the investigator and Lisbeth's eventual love interest.  I found the movie lacking in suspense and character development that were present in the book. However to enjoy the movie to its fullest, I strongly recommend reading the book.Three stars 7/31/10</p></body></html>

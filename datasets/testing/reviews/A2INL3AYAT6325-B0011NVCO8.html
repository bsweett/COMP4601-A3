<meta name="summary" content="Very good but violent film  SPOILERS"></head><body><p>I was looking forward to seeing this film.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Russell (the reason I bought this DVD package) was great.  Denzel did a good job as well.<br /><br />Interesting story to follow.<br /><br />The film is long but in this case you do not mind.  You do NOT get bored.<br /><br />I did NOT like however the unnecessary nudity.  AND WE DID NOT NEED TO SHOOT THE DOG.<br /><br />Excellent DVD package.  Although some of the extras were TV specials or parts of programs I had already taped.<br /><br />It is, of course, violent.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Russell `s, Denzel's or Ridley's you will enjoy the film.<br /><br />I input this review the day before the 2008 Oscars.  TOO BAD the films did not get more nominations.</p></body></html>

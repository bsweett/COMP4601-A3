<meta name="summary" content="3.5 stars -- a thoughtful film but frustratingly incomplete"></head><body><p>What holds back Oliver Stone's film recitiation on the life of President George W. Bush from being better is simple: the film was made too soon, while Bush was still in office, and it excludes the final humiliation of his presidency, the decline and collapse of the employment, stock, housing and oil price markets that occurred in the shattering late summer and autumn of 2008, wrecking America's economy and making way for the Obama presidency and the revolution that followed.<br /><br />There is a certain irony about this film that director Stone, using techniques and storytelling similar to what he captured in his cinematic view of Richard Nixon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063V8K">Nixon - Collector's Edition</a>, has seemingly mellowed with age. His last notable film before this about 9/11 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTRIQ">World Trade Center (Full Screen Edition)</a>, was even mellower in tone and less political. To say W. is not political would be wrong; but to say it is not sympathetic to its leading figure would be even more inaccurate.<br /><br />A second irony is in the casting. While Josh Brolin, a veteran of many great recent films incluidng <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00118T63C">No Country for Old Men</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011V7PSC">In the Valley of Elah</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011HOEY4">American Gangster (2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition)</a>, plays the second President Bush on film, it was his father, James Brolin, that portrayed the father of modern Republicans, President Ronald Reagan, in Showtime's biopic of his presidency <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001US6CI">The Reagans</a>. Unlike that film, where Judy Davis's portrayal of the first lady stole the show, the younger Brolin is the star here, delivering the goods as if the real W. were the handsome Hollywood actor we see on film, DVD and television.<br /><br />Assembling a group of veteran Hollywood stars to fill the critical roles around President Bush -- that includes Richard Dreyfuss as Vice-President Dick Cheney, Scott Glenn as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Thandie Newton as Condaleza Rice and Toby Jones as Karl Rove, the conscience and political mentor of the president, the film goes far to re-enact the days of decision-making prior to the second Iraq war in 2003 and the misguided beliefs about weapons of mass destruction the country was alleged to hold. It is the realization that, after war began, the Bush administration learns there never were such weapons in the country that is the president's disgrace and the film's abrupt and untimely end.<br /><br />For W. is an incomplete film, must as much as that class you took in school were you dropped half way through because of illness and never completed, getting the I on your report card. For it was the summer and autumn of 2008 that defined the presidency of George W. Bush, just as much as it was the recession of 1991-92, and not the success of the first Iraq war, that defined his father's presidency.<br /><br />Another disappointment for me was the film's failure to address development of the "Bush doctrine" that was not borne in the White House by the Bush team, but was birthed in the office parks of Washington and suburbs by non-elected pundits and consultants. The film led one to believe W. was in control of events and policy. Whether true or not, the full impact of those policies, including the policies that led to deregulated financial markets that destroyed the housing and stock markets in September 2008, is what's not in this movie. Shame on a filmmaker of Ollie Stone's history and reputation for doing half the job.</p></body></html>

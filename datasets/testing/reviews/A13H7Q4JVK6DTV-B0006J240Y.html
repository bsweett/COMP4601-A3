<meta name="summary" content="I thought this movie was great."></head><body><p>At first I could'nt see this movie because I listen to the stupid critics (Ebert&Roeper)and thought it was a bad movie, but I change my mind since I like julianne moore and watch it. To me it was very interesting and very emotinal due to the fact that the characters lost their kids ,some parts did'nt make sense and probably they could have explain it more clear. But either way buy it or rent it because it's worth seeing.</p></body></html>

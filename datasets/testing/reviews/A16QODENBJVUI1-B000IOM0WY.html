<meta name="summary" content="Quite solid and very slick but somewhat predictable"></head><body><p>Look, this is a very solid and professionally produced motion picture, and if all you are seeking is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, this film will do as well as most.  But the fact is, we really have seen it all before.  In the case of this film, literally, being an inferior remake of the 1969 version starring Michael Caine (though, to be fair, the plots are quite different).  There isn't anything truly wrong with the film.  The chase scenes are expertly performed, the suspense is just right, the gimmicks engaging and interesting, and, for the most part, the cast highly entertaining.  <p>So why did I feel a bit let down afterwards?  Well, in part because of Mark Wahlberg.  Three things kept running through my mind as I watched him.  One was that he is absolutely terrible compared to Michael Caine's job playing Charlie Kroker.  Caine is one of the great actors in recent decades in the movies, while Wahlberg is pretty much this year's flavor.  A second thing was that the great Jason Statham, who plays Handsome Rob in the film, would have been an infinitely better Charlie Kroker than Wahlberg (maybe its the Cockney accent he has in common with Michael Caine).  Finally, as I listened to Wahlberg flatly deliver one line after another in a dull monotone, it occurred to me that he is clearly one of the worst actors in the world.  Either that or he is content to sleepwalk through a part.  I ought to add that he was surprisingly good in THREE KINGS, though I haven't seen him in anything that was especially well done since.<p>The rest of the cast, thankfully, is much better, though no one is really given much of an opportunity to put their acting skills on display.  Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses in the movies when given a role that draws out her skills (like MONSTER, which should net her an Oscar in a couple of days).  She isn't just a pretty face.  Jason Statham is fine in his rather undemanding role.  I would love to see him in a really dark and bleak film.  I am not sure how wide his range is, but I would like to find out.  Edward Norton is a great actor, but his part, like most of the others, didn't call at all upon his considerable talents.  <p>I did enjoy seeing Donald Sutherland in his brief but key role as John Bridger, the safe cracker who is also the father of Stella (Charlize Theron).  Sutherland starred with Julie Christie in one of the most famous films ever set in Venice, Nicholas Roeg's 1973 DON'T LOOK BACK.  I couldn't help think of that in the various shots that demonstrated that it really was Vienna.<p>By the way, in one scene where you can see Steve Frezelli's (Edward Norton's character) widescreen TV through an outside window, you can definitely see Michael Caine's image on it for a second or so.<p>In short, this is a slickly made film that didn't require much of the actors and doesn't demand much on the part of the viewer.  If one watches it with minimal expectations, one might enjoy it.</p></body></html>

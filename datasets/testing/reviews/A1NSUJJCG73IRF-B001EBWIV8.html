<meta name="summary" content="The Matrix Reloaded (2003)"></head><body><p>Director: Larry Wachowski, Andy Wachowski<br />Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett.<br />Running Time:  132 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, language, and mild sexual situations.<p>When "The Matrix" hit the big screen in 1999, it was the most innovative special effects triumph Hollywood had ever produced.  With the sequel, "The Matrix Reloaded", the Wachowski brothers have actually succeeded in making a second film in the series that is just as exciting, equally as thought-provoking, and perhaps possessing even better special effects.  Can anyone say "The Empire Strikes Back"?<p>"The Matrix Reloaded" takes the audience through a roller-coaster ride from the last-standing city of civilization in Zion to the Matrix, which is a computerized database consisting of humans who are programmed to fuel its very existence.  As the Matrix strives to become more powerful and absolutely take over Earth, Zion attempts to stage war against the evil technological machine empire, using the messiah-like Neo (Reeves) as their catalyst.  What ensues is a spectacle of rip-roaring sequences of more kung-fu fighting than a Bruce Lee movie, a twelve-minute highway chase scene that perhaps may be the best action scene ever produced, and several superb battles between Neo and the evil Mr. Smith.<p>There a few portions of the narrative that seem to be illegitimate, such as the possible love story between Morpheus (Fishburne) and a previous interest played by Jada Pinkett's character, as well as the overused metaphor of love, specifically between Neo and Trinity (played by Moss).  While "Reloaded" does not suffer from these developed themes, they seem to provide a symbolism that the Wachowski brothers are trying to convey, but they are so wrapped up in showing off their CCI effects that they are lost for exactly what they want to show the audience.  What made the original "Matrix" so captivating was the expectance of the unexpected, while what makes "Reloaded" so enjoyable is that we get what we expect, and it is thrown at us like an asteroid colliding with earth.</p></body></html>

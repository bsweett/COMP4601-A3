But that's about it. I did love the visuals in the film. It's filled with dazzling special effects, lovely music, and gorgeous scenery. The late 30's comic and pulp atmosphere is mixed with modern (50's, 60's and today) sci-fi technologies. I think that's what makes it so appealing: this is an excellent mixture of old and new. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are both great in this film; the supporting cast is also very good. But the best things about this film are the visual effects, the cinematography, and the stylish art direction. Watch it for the visuals.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

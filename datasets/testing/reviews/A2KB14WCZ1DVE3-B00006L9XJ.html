<meta name="summary" content="Now this is a western"></head><body><p>You can tell right away that this is not going to be typical Hollywood fare from the beginning.  Please take that as a compliment.  The story is about a group of prostitutes in a small Western town in the 19th century.  A customer with not a lot under the hood overreacts to his rent-a-mate's comment on this and slices up her face with a knife.  After the sheriff shows up and gives less than a slap on the hand for this offense, the ladies get together, pool their money, and get the word out that they'll pay a reward to the party that brings a more "eye for and eye" to the cutter and his companion.  <p>Now it's not this original scene of violence that makes it special.  It's the portrayal of old Western life that does.  While the otherwise masterful "Lonesome Dove" has one of the most beautiful faces in movies in Diane Lane as it's prostitute, the ladies here are, for the most part, very ordinary looking.  More than that, they portray a weariness that shows that their life is not that easy.  In the hands of other Hollywood powers, the ladies would have been Charlie's Angels.<p>Cut to the existence of the movie's main character, played by Clint Eastwood.  He's a former outlaw and killer, reformed by his now dead wife, and faced with the responsibility of raising two children.  The only thing good that can be said of his home is that it's slightly better than the pen where he keeps the hogs he raises, and that's not saying much.  The Ponderosa it ain't.  <p>What Clint Eastwood seemed to want to do in his directorial masterpiece is to turn everything he represented in his previous years of acting and turn in on it's head.  In scene after scene you anticipate the old Clint rearing back and wiping out half a town just to get an appetite up for breakfast.  But time after time we are surprised to see a man who can't even mount his horse properly, and can't hit a target with a pistol from ten feet away.  We see that all his lifestyle has led to is wretched poverty.  <p>The movie grows on you the more you watch it, and the memorable characters have stood the test of time.  Morgan Freeman, as always, brings a knowing weariness in his role as Eastwood's partner.  Richard Harris has a terrific role as an English gunfighter who hires a writer to build his own legend, but has it totally taken apart by the sheriff of the movie's central town.  And Gene Hackman deserves his Oscar as the sheriff who is somehow portrayed as the bad guy when most of the other lead male characters are in the plot for the sole purpose of committing murder.  It is this challenge to our sense of what is right and what is wrong, and if there is sometimes even a difference between the two that makes this a Hall of Fame movie.</p></body></html>

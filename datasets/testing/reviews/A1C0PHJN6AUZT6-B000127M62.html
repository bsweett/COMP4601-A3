I love all the Elm Street movies, and some of the Friday ones, but the whole idea of Freddy and Jason fighting just seemed stupid to me. I caught the end of the movie on TV the other night, and it was pretty good. Turns out my husband has the DVD, so I sat down to watch the whole thing, and it was pretty good. It's not the best of either series, but it's not even close to being the worst.</p></body></html>

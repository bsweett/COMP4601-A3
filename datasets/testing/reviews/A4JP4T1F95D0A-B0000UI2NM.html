It fills in a little more of the story and helps flesh out the story more.  Filled with tons of extras at a reasonable price makes this worth the purchase.  The movie itself is good and the special effects are top notch.  It falls just a bit short of being a 5 star movie, but the disc itself is 5 stars.</p></body></html>

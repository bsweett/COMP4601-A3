<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton is back with Corpse Bride"></head><body><p>This is the 6th time that director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp worked togther on a movie that started all the way back in 1990, with Edward Scissorhands, and then Ed Wood, and then 2 movies last year inclduing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and now this movie, thodse are the only ones that I know of that they worked on in 15 years. Now for a note for parents that this is a pretty dark PG movie, that it might not be best to leave your kids to watch by themsevles. Some where along the way there is mild lanuage. Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is getting married, or maybe like forced into marriage into the broke Evergot family. But of coruse he has cold feet, even if he doesn't hide it very well. His bride is to be Victoria (Emily Watson, who parents jsut well are parents and they are Maudeline Everglot (Joanna Lumley) and Finis Everglot (Albert Finney). He also have parents but they are as snobs as hers are. He keeps messing up on his vows, and run away to a dark forest, and while he is practicing his vows, he ends up putting his ring of which he thinks is a branch of a tree, but a skelton fingers of Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). And let's not get itno her story of way she is a corpse bride. And somehow Victor finds himself married to her, and she brings him to her world, which is home of the dead, where he learns her tale. Victor ends up going missing, comes back with her to "meet" his parents, overhears a conveirson by her parents (Victoria's) and has to sneak in, but she catchs him with the another girl, and brings him back to the land of the dead, and pretty soon, she has to end up marrying Count Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant), who is a strngaer to her, and she doesn't live him. Now this was the 3rd film that was noiminated for best animated feature film, so you can add this on a film, to see if you want to see them, or even just movies that either won or noimated for best animated feature film.</p></body></html>

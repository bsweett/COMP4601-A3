It's freaking hilarious, in a terrible way. Sacha Baron Cohen is himself a Jew, but he makes fun of Jewish people in this film - a LOT. I had to stifle a laugh at the 'Running of the Jew' ceremony. Borat comes to America with the purpose of learning things and coming back to his country (hence the full title of this film)<br /><br />Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson, so while he is on his trip, he attempts to take her as his bride. I have to say that my favorite scene is the one where he is at the rodeo and says he supports George W Bush's 'war of terror', and it is funny to see how Americans react to his Borat persona (not knowing he is merely an actor) and how he purposely mangles his 'understanding' of what they are telling him, such as when he is at that one woman's house and acts as if he does not know what the toilet is for, or when the other woman tries to teach him socialization skills such as telling jokes or how to excuse oneself.<br /><br />Is this movie in bad taste? Yeah! This movie is NOT for everyone, especially those easily offended. But otherwise it is freaking hilarious.</p></body></html>

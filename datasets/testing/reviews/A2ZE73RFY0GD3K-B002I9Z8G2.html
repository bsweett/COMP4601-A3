<meta name="summary" content="And You Guys Are Astronauts On Some Sort of Star Trek?"></head><body><p>This was the best of all the Star Trek movies ever made, the very best.  The plot was superb, the characterization excellent (with one exception, discussed below), the action compelling and the visual presentation magnificent.  Our TNG crew again performed with distinction, revealing humanity's entire range of characteristics from weakness to triumph.  Captain Picard, the character first among equals in this film, prevailed over the Borg, extracting revenge for his assimilation years before.  The Borg Queen was, in all of her grotesque-ness, peculiarly seductive -- even to a guy just watching the DVD.  I hope everyone involved with this film had a great deal of fun working on it, because their results in the Star Trek genre are unsurpassed.<p>The only, only tiny difficulty with this movie -- small but eminently agonizing -- was that Wesley Crusher was not on hand to step in at some point, discover some problem/solution that all of the adults had completely failed to notice, and save the Federation from total annihilation (once again).</p></body></html>

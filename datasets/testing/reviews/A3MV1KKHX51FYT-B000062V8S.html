<meta name="summary" content="Terminating this Series?"></head><body><p>The action is so mechanical and extreme as to amount to a parody of the earlier films. Violent action is no substitute for a good story. Scenes with mechanical machines going wild are implausible. But they provide a car chase like you're never seen before. Could that truck have so much kinetic energy to do that much damage and keep on moving? NO, you would need a freight train. The petite young blond terminatrix seems like a match for the Terminator. (Is this some kind of feminist message or a retelling of Genesis?)<br /><br />This film seems like a down-market version of the earlier films. The "network down" events suggest a fragility of modern life unknown in the past. The flight to the countryside reminds me of the actions of people during medieval plagues. When there is dialogue, as at the mausoleum, it is not first rate. "Don't do that." The special effects are certainly better than in the earlier films. The shape imitation in this film recalls the old horror films (like "The Wolfman"). What is original about this film?<br /><br />Next we learn that "Judgment Day" will occur in a few hours. Nuclear war will wipe out most people! There is a philosophical question in this film. Can the future affect the past? Orwell's "1984" said those who control the present control the future. But only in a fantasy can the future control the past. Those are just idealistic terms, the past is always gone. The present always determines the future, even if we don't understand how.</p></body></html>

He just had to see a movie "with time travel in it!" I'm sure there are lots of sci-fi/fantasy films that would fit the bill, but the first thing to pop into my mind were the iconic '80s "Back to the Future" series of films.<br /><br />Years ago, I had a ball watching this entertaining yet, convoluted Sci-Fi trilogy. The films feature high schooler/amateur musician, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his friend & employer, scientist, Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) as they go back and forth (in a Delorean sports car/time machine) between the past (1955/1885), present (1985) and future (2015). They are trying to to fix the "time continuum" that has been mucked up, when Marty accidentally (in Part I) keeps his parents (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson) from meeting and falling and love in 1955. Marty must get them back together or else he and his family will cease to exist! From there a whole series of time vexing conundrums are set to happen with ripple effects in both the distant future (Part II) and the long ago past of the 'Wild West (Part III).<br /><br />Well, I showed these three films to my six year old and not only did he enjoy them, but he became fanatical about them! Like, most kids, once he saw the series, he wanted to re-watch it over and over again. Now, in most cases, watching the same thing a few zillion times might drive the average parent nuts. But not in this case. It seems like no matter how many times you watch these three films, you will discover something new, that you hadn't realized or connected before. Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale's scripts work brilliantly together. They remind me of a 'Rubik's Cube' or one of those old M. C. Escher illustrations that seems to go on into infinity. Eventually if you watch these films enough times, it becomes clear there are plotlines, details, dialogue and themes, that keep re-occurring in patterns over and over again between characters and generations, no matter what the year is. These three films are just the ultimate in the ideal of movie sequels. Each film really does depend on the other to tell a truely complete story.<br /><br />Besides the brilliant scripts the films also offer wonderful acting performances (especially Fox, Lloyd and Thomas S. Wilson as various bullys in the Tannen family tree), good special effects (which still pretty much hold up for modern day, CGI savey viewers) and a majestic, memorable score, which will stick in your head for days. The three films have now been put together in a three DVD box set called "Back to the Future: The Complete Trilogy". This includes over ten hours of 'extras' including audio commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes ETC.<br /><br />These films will both overwork your brain and excite your imagination! Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Ghost Story.... Ever."></head><body><p>I've seen thousands of horror movies over the years and currently this is my absolute favorite.  Although technically a 'suspense thriller', this film will no doubt be catagorized with other ghost-oriented films.  Not a lot of gore here.  No graphic violence, either.  What we have here is mostly atmosphere; and it's intensely unnerving.  There are no 'quick-edit' scenes that seem to be in every horror movie these days.  No cheap startles designed to make the viewer jump.  It's just an incredible story of a mother's love for her child with the backdrop of a haunted house.  There's not a single wasted scene in this film.  Everything has its place and meaning.  It's so masterfully put together that even if you're not moved by the story itself, you'll be transfixed by the actual techniques used in this film.  This is not a 'special-effects' feature; just simplistic filmaking that could have easily been done forty years ago and still manage to creep the hell out of the audience decades later.  See this movie.  I cannot recommend it enough.<br /><br />~nico~</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="..there's just nothing that special about it..."></head><body><p>I really liked the "Ocean's Eleven", and was fairly disappointed in "Ocean's 12", but the addition of Al Pacino in this film, I had hopes that this series would bounce back. But ultimately, there's nothing really special about this film. It's not bad, its not great. It's just somewhere in-between. The plot was pretty simple. There really were no big twists or surprises in the film, and the few twists they did throw in, you could see coming ahead of time. One thing I did like was the pacing of the film, it did move quickly, but almost too quickly. After the first 30 minutes or so of the film, you know pretty much everything that's gonna happen in the rest of film. You know basically every aspect of the heist, and how they are gonna pull it off. As far as acting, you can't argue with the talent in these films, but to me, there seemed to a lot of "sleepwalking" in some of the roles. People just going through the motions. No, there weren't bad performances, but it just seemed that the weren't putting there all into some scenes. And Al Pacino, well he was pretty much like all the rest. There really was no big dramatic scenes with him, and no Oscar worthy performances here. He came in, played a part in the film, and that was it. I just felt that the writers/directors could've made his role more dramatic, or maybe, like I said, Pacino wasn't fully into the character. But anyway, for whatever the reason, this film is simply ok. Like I said, nothing real special. As far as comparing it to the rest of the series, it comes no where near the first film, and maybe slightly better than the second one. Of course, it's worth watching, and I probably need to view a couple of more times, but I wouldn't buy this film with a brand new price sticker on it. I'm sure I'll find it in a used DVD store soon enough for half the price.</p></body></html>

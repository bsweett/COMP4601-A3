<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie, Better Book"></head><body><p>The producers of this film were so intent on getting Will Smith to star that they changed the story and 'invented' his character.  In the book Det. Spooner didn't exist.  However, in a world that can 'reinvent' remakes, why not a classic book?  That note aside the movie itself is pretty good.  Loads of action and spectacular special effects dominate this film.  It really moves at a fast clip with confident direction and solid performances by all.  It really is a lot of fun to watch, with that "Independence Day" popcorn feel.  A great way to spend an evening, or rainy day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funnier and Better Made Than Ocean's 12"></head><body><p>I'm not sure if anyone wanted another film after 0cean's 12. It was hard to follow with too much camera movements and handheld camera usesage. Ocean's 13 is about as slick and cool as the original though. The gang rejoin to hit a greedy Casino owner's new Casino. He's played by Al Pacino  who ripped off one of their own played by Elliott Gould. Gould doesn't take it too well, infact it almost kills him. So the gang is back but for revenge this time around. It's not a thick plot but it's more of a plot than Ocean's 12 had anyway.<br /><br />  Everyone is back from the original but Julia Roberts and I think her character is just mentioned by Brad Pitt once but not by name. The film is entertaining enough to easily forget about her though. It's stylish and cool and yes there's some good laughs as well. What's funnier and interesting than the actual robbery is them doing everything they can to make sure the new hotel/Casino gets rated bad. They do this by making the guy who rates the place stay there horrible in anyway they can. It's also pretty funny how Clooney watches Opera and gets teared up when a house is built for a family on her show. The film wasn't needed that much but this time it's just not the cast that's having a good time like with Ocean's 12. The movie isn't fantastic but it's enjoyable and fun enough to recommend.</p></body></html>

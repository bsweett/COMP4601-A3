On each one of our individual journeys there are thousands of things that can happen to knock us off our feet and set us back hundreds of paces.  It can be really frustrating and confusing.  Yet, the trials of life shouldn't be an excuse for giving up.  We can move forward towards "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  That's what Chris Gardner did.<br /><br />THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is an inspiring movie about some of the events in Gardner's life and how he was able to overcome them.  Gardner (played by Will Smith) was a struggling salesman of portable bone density scanners.  He used his life savings to pay for the venture and it was a costly mistake, but Gardner didn't give up.  He was determined to work the pavement, going from one medical office to another until he sold every last unit and could move on to better things.  His wife is unhappy in their marriage, his car has been possessed by the City of San Francisco, and they are almost three months behind due on their rent.  In this desperate time Gardner becomes inspired to apply for an internship at a major stock brokerage firm.  He impresses the employers and is offered the competitive internship, only to discover that it's a six month unpaid internship.  Determined to change things around, Gardner takes the position.  His wife leaves and Gardner is left to raise their son alone.  Together the father and son struggle as they are evicted from one place and another, homelessness, an auto accident, tax seizure, and mediocre child care all in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Will Smith is one of America's great actors.  He can do drama, action, comedy, romance, and just about any other genre and not just do it, but do it well.  In this film he is joined by his own son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, portraying Gardner's son, Christopher.  Will Smith and Jaden must have a strong relationship and it comes across in the movie.  The real-life relationship between the film's stars helps ground the movie even more.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS.  The movie seemed real and true. Unlike many inspirational stories and biopics I've seen, it wasn't an over-sentimental, mushy, feel-good fluffy film.  Instead, to me, I felt like I was watching a few chapters from the biography of someone's life; a person who had overcome some incredible odds.  I also enjoyed the strong relationship displayed between Gardner and Christopher.  So often in movies, even ones based on real people, children neglect their parents and parents neglect their children.  That wasn't the case in this film.  It's nice for a change to watch a movie that shows a deep and strong relationship between a father and his son.  Now, that's inspirational.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A VERY CREEPY LITTLE GHOST STORY"></head><body><p>"The Others" does what no suspense/thriller/horror/drama hybrid of the recent decades has been able to do, instill fear and a genuine sense of the unsettling without resorting to gore, guts and gruesomeness to get its shock value across.  The story concerns itself with a young mother of two children who is hold up in a grand English manor waiting for WWII to be over.  However, when she employs three peasants who used to work the same land some time before, the scares really start to add up.  There's noises in the attic, shadows on the wall and "the others" - a set of disturbing (?) that wreak terror on the entire family.  The ending will truly shock.<br />Miramax 2-disc edition has been handsomely attempted.  Colors are intentionally faded but well balanced.  There is some minor edge enhancement, some scenes that have extremely low contrast and a hint of fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will terribly distract.  Also, there are a few scenes in which the picture appears slightly out of focus.  This is a very dark visual presentation and watching it in a completely darkened room is recommended to get the most out of the experience.  The sound is 5.1 and quite effective.  Dialogue is presented at perhaps a listening level a few notches below what is considered normal so turn up your volume before you start to watch.  Extras on disc 2 include documentaries, featurettes, theatrical trailers, interviews and stills.  Overall a very nice job.</p></body></html>

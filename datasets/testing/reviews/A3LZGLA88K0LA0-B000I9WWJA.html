<meta name="summary" content="CHANGE OF PACE FOR SPIKE LEE"></head><body><p>This is one of the most successful boxoffice films for the formidable director Spike Lee.  Fortunately, he is blessed with performers like Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe.  They are excellent in their roles in this unusual heist film which ultimately turns into a hostage situation for something more than money.<br /><br />Washington brings his cool reserve and winning sense of humor to his role as the hostage negotiator who has his own internal problems as well; Owen is quietly sinister in his role as the henchman of the robbery; Foster is superb in a strange role as a different kind of negotiator; Plummer is effective as the bank owner with his own dark secrets; and an unusually subdued Dafoe is stoic as a policeman working with Washington.<br /><br />Lee's direction is crisp and on target.  My main problem with the movie is the lack of giving Owen any history that explains how he knows Plummer's secret and just what he hopes to accomplish.  If that had been a little more clearer, this movie could have become a much better film.</p></body></html>

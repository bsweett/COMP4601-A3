<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest films ever made"></head><body><p>This is the greatest western I've ever seen, and on my list of the greatest movies ever made.  I am so impressed with it.  I've been watching the movies that made Time Magazine's list of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and very few of them can compare to this one, which happens to be on their list.  Their list should be honored to include Unforgiven, and not the other way around, because the Time Magazine list also includes a lot of inferior films to this one, like Citizen Kane, which can't hold a candle to Unforgiven.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a retired gunslinger raising two small children alone because his beloved wife died.  He accepts a job to kill two vicious men who mutilated a whore.  The bounty, raised by the whore's co-workers, is $1,000.  He has two other gunslingers to help with the job - Morgan Freeman and some young punk with bad vision.<br /><br />Gene Hackman plays the brutal sheriff who refuses to punish the evildoers.  He lets them go free, with a fine.  This infuriates the other whores, resulting in their offering a bounty.<br /><br />Character development and realism are two of the strongest traits of this great film.  It has a satisfying ending as well, which is important to me.  I'm not going to ruin it for you.  You've found one of the greatest films ever made.  Go get it.</p></body></html>

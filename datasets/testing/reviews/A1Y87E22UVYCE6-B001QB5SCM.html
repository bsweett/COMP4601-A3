<meta name="summary" content="Sisters: Love & Hatred."></head><body><p>Director Curtis Hanson has filmed many remarkable films: "The Hand that Rock the Cradle" (1992), "LA Confidential" (1997) and "8 Mile" (2002). All of them were a fairly box office success at their release. Yet none of them may anticipate Hanson's incursion on a "Family Conflict" genre movie.<br /><br />Wow! What a debut in this area! IMHO "In Her Shoes" (2005) may be compared with such remarkable films as Woody Allen's Interiors (1978), Robert Redford's wonderful, four Oscar winners "Ordinary People" (1980) and also five Oscar winners "Terms of Endearment" (1983).<br /><br />The story is about two sisters.<br /><br />Rose, the elder one, is a successful lawyer with an unsuccessful love record. She compensates this frustration buying wonderful dresses and lots of shoes.<br /><br />Maggie the younger and amazingly beautiful sister is unable to keep a job and be an independent person. Nevertheless she is able to seduce whichever male she decides to. Things start to get messed up when Rose gives shelter to Maggie.<br /><br />The young cute uses her sister's shoes, car and dresses and eventually seduces her recent lover. Obviously Rose expels Maggie.<br /><br />Fate let Maggie discover that she has a loving Grandma living in Florida and there she goes trying to profit from her.<br /><br />Grandma Ella and her senior friends prove to be smarter than Maggie and start to re-educate her.<br /><br />The film follows both sisters living in far apart cities and their spiritual and intellectual growth.<br /><br />Ella will reunite them and "family secrets" will be discovered and solved one by one.<br /><br /> Play acting is outstanding. Australian actress Toni Collete as Rose gives a very convincing characterization, showing with subtlety her internal changes. One more detail: she had to gain weight (25 pounds) for the first part of the story and then lose them.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is more, much more, than a pretty woman. She gives deepness to her character and let the audience know little by little of her internal suffering.<br /><br />What to say about Shirley MacLaine?  She IS a great actress and always gives some uniqueness to her character. Her Ella is full of tender wisdom and at the same time steel stubbornness.<br /><br />Mark Feuerstein as Simon (Rose's fianc&eacute;), Ken Howard as girl's father and Jerry Adler as Ella's pretender are solid and true to life.<br /><br />Thumbs up for this movie!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

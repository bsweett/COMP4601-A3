<meta name="summary" content="Not a super movie"></head><body><p>I thought this sequel could've been a lot better then what it is, like many of today's sequels & remakes of classics, they put all there time and effort into the effects they can do now that they couldn't do back when the originals where made and after that they decided to try & write a script around it.<br /><br />PLOT: Superman has left the planet and hasn't been seen for years since the last movie, apparently he left the planet because astrologers thought they had found his planet of Krypton, so he went to see for himself only to return to say it wasn't there to his Earth mother who they may as well have not included in the movie as she plays in scenes that aren't relevant to the story and she has nothing to do with anything in this movie.<br /><br />So Superman's back, he discovers Lois Lane had moved on with her life and settled down, gotten married and had a kid. Lex Luther managed to get out of his life sentence and has managed to steal the crystals of Superman's arctic home and use them for world domination. So Superman has to come back and save the day while feeling unloved.... boo-hoo.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the storyline to this one, I think they tried to show Superman's heartbreak over discovering Louis was married and had a kid, but quite frankly i never felt for him at all, nor did I feel one bit sad for him at the end of this movie with what happens or feel touched by his words to his so...mthing ... and I think they where trying to show that Superman excepted the husband, but man, that needed a huge re-write to tell it better along with so much else that you can pick up on and say "I get it" but I doubt anyone could say they felt it.<br /><br />The whole thing doesn't have the feel of the 70's/80's versions that this is a sequel to. There is just way too many visual effects, too much sickening CGI that is not needed to tell a story, I couldn't adjust to the characters not even resembling the original actors, and I suppose they did some ground breaking CGI effects and showed things that wasn't possible in the other movies, but again, use them to a well written plot instead of making a movie around the CGI.<br /><br />For the first half of the movie I was a bit confused not being able to work out what the hell was happening, I guess it all kind of made sense by the end, and speaking of the end, as I predicted, leave it as a set-up for a sequel.<br /><br />I didn't like the way the movie started, it was slow, confusing and boring, the middle kind of picked up a bit and became a little bit better, then the ending just had no satisfaction at all, an end to a superman movie should be climactic, not just be over and done with then fly around for 5 minutes.<br /><br />And another thing about the CGI, what is with this greyish looking fog thing all over these days' movies? War Of The Worlds did the same thing, have producers and moviemakers in Hollyweed got something against using more then 5 colours these days? Why can't they add some bright colours? Why cant trees be green and oceans be blue? Why do they almost have to be grey and dark all the time with fake fog and mist all over the place? It might be a work of art to those developing it, but give us a break and try and do something that looks real and doesn't make you nauseous for crying out loud.<br /><br />Bottom line is, this film was made simply by going to Warner and someone saying, "hey we can do more visually now then what we could back then with Superman, here is an hours worth of CGI, what do you say we cash in and make some money out of it? Don't worry about the plot or acting or a good script, you know the title alone will be gold"</p></body></html>

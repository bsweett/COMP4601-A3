The story does not drag at all, it seems everyone involved in the kidnapping is corrupt, even our hero Creasy, but it is also surprisingly touching at a couple of points. The action sequences are really well done and I like the overall dark, gritty feel. Denzel Washington gives a superb performance,  as does Christopher Walken, but young Dakota Fanning absolutely shines.</p></body></html>

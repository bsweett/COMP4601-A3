Just about no one else is that easy to place.<br /><br />This movie is the best in a lot of different directions. For one, it's at the top of the new noir. Everything and everyone has a dark edge; the good guys have a bad edge, and the bad guys have a really bad edge, and some of them are just over over the edge. Just about every scene is night, a dark time for the dark businesses of murder and revenge. And best, this isn't just one story, it's three or four that wind together.<br /><br />It's also probably the best comic book adaptation ever. The comic's original writer and artist, Frank Miller, was co-director, and he brought these stories to their dark, gritty life the way it needed to be done. The actors put in some memorable performances, too - Elijah Wood's "Kevin" is no hobbit, not even a little. The script is close to the original, but the visuals are so true to Miller's chiaroscuro art that it's incredible.<br /><br />This is also one of the most creative, pointed uses of color in any movie I've ever seen. It's black and white, with the emphasis on the black - like the characters themselves, there's not a lot of gray in the middle. That makes every spot of color matter, starting with that first red dress and soft mouth full of red lipstick. Goldie's hair, Cindy's eyes, that yellow b*st*rd, and blood. Lots of blood. Sometimes, though the blood turns black as death, or glows white like molten metal - the color (or lack) conveys the mood better than literality ever could.<br /><br />It's not for the squeamish, though. The hookers and strippers do their work out of sight, but the violence gets pretty raw. It's a raw story, though.<br /><br />And it's great. It's not at literate as the Maltese Falcon, maybe, but it's a comic book, and great within its kind.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

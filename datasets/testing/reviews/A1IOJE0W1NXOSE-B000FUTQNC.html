His family is kidnapped and he is forced to break into his own computer system in order to get money for the extortionists.  He is losing his family at the same time that his efforts to save them make him look guilty of stealing money from the bank.  Ford has played similar roles numerous times, but that may be why he's so good at it.  He has a capable supporting cast, including Paul Bettony as the villain, Virginia Madsen as Ford's wife, and Mary Lynn Rajskub, as his secretary.  Although similar plots have appeared in several movies, this one does provide a good evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

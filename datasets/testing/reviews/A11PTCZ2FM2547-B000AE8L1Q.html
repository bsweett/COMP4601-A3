<meta name="summary" content="Missing A Gear"></head><body><p>THE UPSIDE OF ANGER has so much going for it:  a once-happily married housewife (Joan Allen) thrown into rage and despair when she's convinced her husband has left the country to be with his secretary; a washed-up, boozing, ex-baseball player (Kevin Costner) who is lonely and fears the emptiness of his life; and four teenage daughters, each one of them coping with the abrupt disappearance of their father while they embark on the problematic, often disappointing, experiences of teenage life.  Thus, the stage is set for a powerful, compelling, bittersweet film, yet THE UPSIDE OF ANGER misses the mark, and misses it badly.<br /><br />The weak link certainly doesn't exist within the actors.  Allen gives a gutsy, vindictive, manipulative, and heartfelt performance as broken-hearted Terry Wolfmeyer--a woman who drowns her sorrows with vodka and takes out her anger and rage on anyone and everyone around her.  Costner, who for years has been nothing more than a Hollywood afterthought, turns in a superb performance as former Detroil Tiger great Denny Davies, a friend of the Wolfmeyer family who finds himself drawn by Terry's pain, and ultimately becomes her soulmate.  Alicia Witt, Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, and Evan Rachel Wood are all very convincing (and often very funny) as the silent-suffering daughters.  The chemistry and interaction of the players--as they sit around the dinner table, as they quarrel, laugh, cry--is terrific and completely believable.<br /><br />So what's wrong?  The problem lies with writer/director Mike Binder (who also plays a sleazy radio producer in the film).  I felt like Binder was given the keys to a Lexus, but never taught how to drive it.  The movie, the scenes, the pacing, were all so uneven, even choppy, that I found myself losing complete interest in the story.  Even worse was the screenplay; it was hollow and superficial, and almost every scene came across as unorganized and ad libbed.  Much of the dialogue absolutely went nowhere, ending by an actor shaking his or her head and muttering, "Oh. . .never mind."  It was painful to watch; even more painful was the realization Binder squandered a golden opportunity to make an absolutely wonderful film.<br /><br />What salvaged this review from a two-star to a three-star rating was the ending; it came completely out of nowhere, and it was incredibly powerful and moving.  THE UPSIDE OF ANGER does have a tremendous upside--the acting.  Unfortunately, the downside--the pacing and writing--drags this movie down, way down.<br /><br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

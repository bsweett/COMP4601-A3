<meta name="summary" content="A delightful animated masterpiece!!!!"></head><body><p>Sleeping Beauty is one of the most ambitious animated films ever made. It's a gorgeous, elegant, and absolutely amazing landmark in animation; a film so charming, memorable, and beautiful that it has been hailed as the most incomparable film in the animated genre, and with good reason. Detailed backgrounds, glorious colors, outstanding visuals and beautiful music are all contributing factors to the grandeur pageantry that &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; enthralls on its audience.<p>Up until the last few years, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was actually considered one of the few Disney 'failures.' That means, a poor box-office success. But that was 1959. Since then, the film, like &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia,&quot; has returned to theaters many times and made way on video for new generations to enjoy, earning large estimates of money and critical praise, not to mention being the most requested Disney film on video after &quot;Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;The Lion King.&quot; <p>It was finally re-released in a fantastic Special Edition DVD, and looking back, I can't believe this was once considered a failure. As if! This is not just a timeless tale of good and evil; the plot is elegantly portrayed with rich textures and stunning animation.<p>Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's best animated films, EVER, and a must-own DVD for any collection. If only Disney still made films like this. I don't think we could be so lucky. Don't delay, get this before time runs out!!!</p></body></html>

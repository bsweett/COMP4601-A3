<meta name="summary" content="Old gags and humor make up Shrek the Third"></head><body><p>Like all trilogies and/or sequels, Shrek the Third lacks the charm and originality than gained the original film its popularity. Shrek the Third is nothing more than an excuse for excuse's sake to continue the franchise and for Hollywood to "ride the money train".I resisted watching this film in the theater, and it turned out for good reason. While it's not a total and utter disappointment like other films or sequels I've seen, it just lacks "the punch" that the first film possessed. There were some funny moments here and there, but the use of the same gags and humor for a third time around just lacks the punch line. To my disappointment, I read a while back of the plan to not only make a fourth Shrek film, but that a spin off with Puss in Boots is in the discussion stage as well. Has Hollywood grown this desperate?<br /><br />  Well, fortunately for them, they have the gullible public to fall back on so they will always make a profit. How much more pathetic and disappointing can Hollywood become and the public be? A boycott is called for (I.M.O) for people to be more responsible and deliver a message to demand a better film, more "bang" for your buck be produced rather than settle for the garbage over and over again. Costs have been rising in most places to see and enjoy a film in a theater. To some, maybe they are just easily entertained and like someone with tunnel vision and blinders on, they just can't tell the difference and any empty, shallow intelligence draining film will do. Come on, wake up folks.<br /><br />  I understand it's hard to say "No" to you kids. They are bombarded with commercials and toys of such films as Shrek virtually by the minute, but you could at least hold out for something better, and worst case scenario...wait until it hits the DVD shelf? These days the turn around has been widdled down to a few short months instead of years. So, in basic summery, Shrek the Third delivers a simple message of just "believing in oneself" surrounded by a basic story of Shrek inheriting the Kingdom of Far, Far Away but not wanting it because he's an Ogre. Prince Charming rallies all the other "losers" or the faerie world to take over the kingdom, Shrek is sent on a quest to retrieve the "next" in line, Fiona is pregnant and what you have here is a soap opera for kids.<br /><br />  Like I said, there are some laughs and some entertaining moments, but nothing to write home about. The first Shrek film is obviously the best of choice, and I did like the second one as well, but the third just doesn't deliver. Kids can't typically tell the difference, but parents should. How can you not know when you are being fed a plate of "crap"? I can sniff out a stinker a mile away and more.<br /><br />  There are many "give aways" and tell tale signs of how bad a film is going to suck. One of the easiest is when you have an original film that is rich, new and original such as the first "Shrek" film and then sequels are made to dilute everything down from one film to the next. Another is by being aware how much a film is being promoted. Sequels typically ride the shirt tales of profit and popularity. The more a film is promoted, the chances of it being a dud on screen is awfully high, or sometimes...the "lack of" promotion simply because the studio knows it will make  money is DVD sales and rentals no matter how bad it is. Lastly, you can pin it on talent, or lack there of. Bad actors make good scripts bad and bad ones ever worse, and occasionally the opposite, a badly written script or thought out plot can make a great actor look ridiculous.<br /><br />  Obvious stinkers are: The Incredible Hulk, Godzilla, Transformers, Titanic (made a blockbuster solely by "popularity"),The Ocean's 12,13 films, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and it's following prequels, a few of the Star Trek films, Spiderman 2 and especially 3,Crank, Smoking Aces, The Fast and the Furious films/sequels and the list goes on and is ever growing. Do yourself a favor and be a bit more mindful of bad films before you grant them a 4 or 5 star rating and bit less of a gullible consumer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eeery, a fine classic except for international version"></head><body><p>One cannot deny that Kubrick's vision of THE SHINING is brilliant.  The atmosphere is eeery, and while not entirely scary, can be difficult to watch late at night in the dark! The story focusses on a family who go up into the mountains to look after a hotel which is shutdown during the winter months.  Jack Nicholson is spot on as the father who is slowly going mad. Is it from the isolation, or is it from the evilness of the hotel itself?  Shelly Duvall plays his wife, and while I think they could have chosen someone better to play this role, she pulls it off adequately.<br /><br />The marketing of the movie itself has a life of its own.  In the UK, it got poor reviews from a test audience in 1980, so Kubrick edited the film for international audiences down to a 113 minute version (in a sense a forced "Director's cut"). This version is what all DVD's outside of America now feature. At least Kubrick made the cuts, and not Warner Bros.<br /><br />Not having seen the longer 143 minute version, my concern is that the edited version does not answer many questions. I have read that the US version looks at the father's alcoholism, whereas the international version overlooks this.  One Aussie reviewer states that the edited version is "nicely paced with more energy". To me it just feels like something is missing from the international cut. It would have been nice of Warner Bros to add this additional 30 minutes as deleted scenes to the international DVD's.<br /><br />Aspect ratio - originally filmed in 1:66 format, and transferred to DVD as 1:33 as requested by Kubrick. Best viewed on a standard TV. Kubrick was not a fan of widescreen movies.<br /><br />Best advice to anyone considering buying this, is to grab the US DVD.</p></body></html>

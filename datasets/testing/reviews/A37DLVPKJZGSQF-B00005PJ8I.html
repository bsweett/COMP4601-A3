<meta name="summary" content="A highly successful movie, Cast Away is worth your money."></head><body><p>Cast Away is the second movie Robert Zemeckis made in 2000, and it's by far his best one. The director is bringing out a lot of worthy films at the moment, and choosing to work with Tom Hanks an awful lot is the right answer to success. So, what makes Cast Away worth seeing? From the trailer, it looks like a guy gets stranded on an island, yes? Well, the movie has a deeper meaning to it - it's about not abandoning what you believe in and never giving up on hope. We've probably all heard that meaning before, but since it is only one actor playing all of it out by himself, it seems somehow more complex and detailed. Tom Hanks' performance is absolutely brilliant; his most memorable yet playing a character that has morals everyone should follow. Helen Hunt isn't in this movie much, but when Hanks and her pucker up, it's one of the most magical moments in the movie. Cast Away is adventurous, daring, sickening and beautiful, I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

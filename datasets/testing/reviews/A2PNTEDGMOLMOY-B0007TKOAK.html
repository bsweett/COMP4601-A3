<meta name="summary" content="A "Little Film" Makes the Big Time"></head><body><p>It's always dangerous when you are late in coming to a small movie that has unexpectedly hit the big time -- your viewing enjoyment may be hampered by the crushing weight of expectations.  It's wonderful when you can be among the first to see small-budget classics like Stanely Tucci's "Big Night," but I didn't get to see "Sideways" until after the Oscar nominations, the critics' Top 10 lists, and so on.  How could "Sideways" possibly live up to these awesome credentials?<br /><br />Well, "Sideways" does live up to its billing, and it does so through one simple virtue -- truth.  "Sideways" is an extremely funny and insightful examination of two men struggling with their mediocrity -- one who is all too aware of his shortcomings, and another who uses a pathetic Peter Pan syndrome to keep at bay the harsh glare of reality.<br /><br />The self-aware guy is Miles (the lovable schlub Paul Giamatti), a recently divorced middle school English teacher who's having a difficult time getting his novel published . . . or even explained.  Miles is awash in bitterness, but he knows deep down that he's a sweet guy once you get past the sour layers (of which there are many).  The ignorant guy is Jack (Thomas Hayden Church), Miles' freshman roommate from San Diego State and a mildly successful actor.  Jack is one of those guys who should be thankful for the successes he has, but is incapable of doing so because by accepting a given success, he is placing a ceiling on his dreams.<br /><br />The "plot" of "Sideways" revolves around Jack's impending marriage.  Engaged to a rich beauty and walking down the aisle on Saturday, Jack gets escorted by Miles for a week of freedom in the California central coast wine country.  While wine, for Jack, is a means for getting drunk, it is a religion for Miles.  Of course, it's obvious to anyone who spends five minutes with Miles that he uses his mastery of wine as a defense mechanism ("I appreciate great wine, so I must be worth something") - thanks to the witty script, "there's just like the faintest soup?on of like, uh, asparagus," has entered our lexicon of pretentious criticism.  Miles can use his focus on wine to avoid meeting people who could possibly reject him.<br /><br />That's difficult on this trip, because Miles has met his soulmate, Maya (Virginia Madsen), who is a waitress at a wine country restaurant.  Miles and Maya share a devotion to wine, and Miles is continuously surprised at the depth and character of this woman.  The question of whether Miles can break out of his various layers of emotional armor to forge a connection with this delightful woman dominates the movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Miles, Jack is as shallow as Miles is deep.  In a classic self-destructive move, Jack gets involved with Stepanie (Sandra Oh), a vibrant single mother and good friend of Maya's.  A pell-mell romance ensues, with the ever-so-slight complication that Jack hasn't told Stephanie about his impending marriage.  Watching Jack skirt emotional ruin while selfishly justifying his caddish behavior is a gruesome delight.<br /><br />Through it all, the script for "Sideways" puts believable, memorable lines into the mouths of these talented actors.  Long narratives about wine reveal surprising details of the speakers, and each character receives a separate, distinct voice (this isn't a Quentin Tarantino movie where all the actors sound like Saint Quentin, or a George Lucas movie where all the actors sound like idiots).  A "talky" movie, "Sideways" never runs out of steam.<br /><br />There is plenty of humor in "Sideways," but most of it is reserved - you will chuckle more often than laugh outright - but there are a few gut-busting moments, as well.<br /><br />"Sideways" is an attractive movie, but it is shot with a realistic eye -- the California wine country looks great, but this is not an "eye candy" movie like "Under the Tuscan Sun," which looked sumptuous but had little else to offer.  "Sideways" gets the balance of visuals and substance just right - one can easily imagine Miles liking his own movie, and that is high praise.</p></body></html>

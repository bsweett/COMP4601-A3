<meta name="summary" content="A tense, snappy, edge-of-your-seat thriller."></head><body><p>Clocking in at only 80 minutes, "Phone Booth" resembles an unusually bloody, foul-mouthed episode of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." Colin Farrell gives a masterful performance as a cocky, two-timing New York publicist who is gradually turned into a quivering, remorseful mass of jelly by a psychopathic sniper on the other end of the line at a Manhattan phone booth. Put the receiver down, and I will kill you, the sniper tells him, taking out a guy or two on the street to prove his point (and making it look like Farrell did it in the bargain). Director Joel Schumacher keeps the tension at a high level throughout the movie, and he manages to keep in check his usual penchant for grandiose cinematic flourishes (except for extraneous outer-space shots at the beginning and end). Besides Farrell's excellent performance, the movie is helped greatly by Forest Whitaker as a courageous police negotiator and by the superbly menacing, burnt-umber voice of Kiefer Sutherland, serving as the voice of the sniper.</p></body></html>

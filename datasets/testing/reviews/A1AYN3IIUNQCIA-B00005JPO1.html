<meta name="summary" content="A Good Dose Of Nostalgia, Nothing More"></head><body><p>So its almost been...twenty years since the last Indiana Jones movie and after all that time, a fourth film has finally been done, with Speilberg, Ford, and Lucas all re-teaming up again for a new adventure with everyone's favorite archeoligist.<br /><br />From the very beginning, things start going. We find an older Indy being taken captive by a group of Soviets, led by the bobbed Cate Blanchett, using him to find a treasure hidden within the confines of the mysterious Area 51, which turns out to be that of a crystal skull that hold mysterious powers. After that, Indy finds himself on another quest, in tow a young greaser named Mutt (LeBeouf) and the return of Marion Ravenwood from the first film, as the three set out to find the mysterious lost kingdom where the skull came from, all the while sidestepping the Soviets advance.<br /><br />To put it all in a nutshell, Indy 4 is basically just a good ole dose of nostalgia for all those whole grew up with the beloved series. But that aside, the film is pretty weak compared to the original three, in both spirit and concept. Where the first films were all witty and original, with genuine stunts and thrilling chases, this Indy has suddenly taken on a very glossy effect and we find a lot of the characters pretty hallow in comparision to the other films.<br /><br />One big problem with the film is the plot in general. The whole idea of aliens, mayan temples, mind control, to put it as one reviewer said, it starts to cross over into X-Files territory, which seems to completly dislocate the whole movie from its beginnings. This also happens to be the first film of the whole series where effects seemed to have taken over from the general idea of the whole films, and thats the shear fun of it all. With all that said, the film just does not make an impression, which is really quite sad. Its like, Speilberg and Lucas had all this time and this is really the best they could come up with?<br /><br />Indy 4 will definantly please all hardcore fans, who will gladly welcome back the archeoligist with open arms. Other then that, this film really has nothing else to offer and may be a sign that Indy should hang the fedora up once and for all.</p></body></html>

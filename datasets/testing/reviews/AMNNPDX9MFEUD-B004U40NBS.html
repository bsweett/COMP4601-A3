<meta name="summary" content="Psychological masterpiece"></head><body><p>As one brilliant reviewer put it, this movie stays with you long afterward and that, to me, is the hallmark of an extraordinary experience. I will be dreaming about and thinking about this fantastic movie for days and would happily pay box office prices to see it again.<br />Natalie Portman - an actress I'm not that enamored with - gives the performance of a lifetime as the ballerina who is steadily and rapidly breaking down psychologically. The movie joyfully toys with what is real and what is her illusion and, even though the black swan/white swan concept is somewhat in your face, the twists and surprises kept me guessing as to what was real and what was not. The supporting cast does stellar work, particularly Barbara Hershey as Portman's controlling mother and fading prima ballerina Winona Ryder. But it's the vision and Portman's riveting performance that were so compelling and captivating.<br />I recommend the theater if possible as the experience is so much greater when you find yourself lost in this oft-surreal world. For what it's worth, I saw True Grit and enjoyed it. Black Swan was immensely better. This is one I will surely buy when it comes out on dvd. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

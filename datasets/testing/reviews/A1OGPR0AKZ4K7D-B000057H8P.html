<meta name="summary" content="Singin in the Rain"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies ever made.  With a talented cast consisting of Gene Kelley, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor you can't go wrong.  There are so many unforgettable scenes in this movie that no one could ever touch.  Gene Kelley singing and dancing his way thru the neighborhood to Singin in the Rain, and all three companionably working their magic to Good Mornin.</p></body></html>

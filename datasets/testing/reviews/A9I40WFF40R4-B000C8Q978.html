<meta name="summary" content="Quiet Goes The Don"></head><body><p>Don Johnston (Bill Murray) just after his latest alliance walks out on him gets a mysterious unsigned letter (all in pink) supposedly from an old lover informing him that he sired a son 19 years ago and that that child is on a search to find his father. Don's nextdoor neighbor convinces that he should go on a road trip to interview the possible candidates for the author of the letter and comes up with the names of five woman, four living and one deceased.<br /><br />The rest of the movie essentially is about Johnston's quest. Bill Murray is a terrific actor, having great timing. He is joined by other good actors, particularly Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange; but their fine performanes do not keep this movie from dragging. The last movie I rented was "The Brown Bunny." I am sorry to say that this film reminded me a lot of more of that dog than I would have liked. Some of the driving scenes are almost as slow. Even Chloe Sevigny makes an appearance here but this time as the assistant to Jessica Lange, the "animal communicator," rather than as a specialist in oral sex.<br /><br />I really wanted this film to be a lot better.</p></body></html>

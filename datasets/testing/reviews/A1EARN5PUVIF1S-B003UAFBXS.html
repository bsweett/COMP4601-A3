<meta name="summary" content="Bubba Go Sleep"></head><body><p>This &quot;redemptive Elvis mummy movie&quot; is a cute idea not very well realized.  I think the problem is the script.  The action is kind of plodding (well, you are dealing with two old guys with a walker and wheelchair respectively), and the dialog is lame and vulgar.  In addition, the soundtrack keeps hitting you over the head with the same musical theme, that sounds like something ripped off from Local Hero, or whatever the movie of some years back that Mark Knopfler scored.  Bubba had me looking at my watch after about thirty minutes -- and I wound up returning the video to the rental store without even checking out the deleted scenes.  If the scenes included in the movie are this weak, I have no interest in seeing the ones not deemed even that worthy!  A great waste of the talent of Ossie Davis.  The director Don Toscarelli needs to be advised that writing his own screenplay was NOT the way to save money on this admittedly low-budget production.</p></body></html>

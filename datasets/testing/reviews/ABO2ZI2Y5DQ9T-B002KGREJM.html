<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining Thriller with Towering Presence of Forest Whitaker"></head><body><p>To watch "The Last King of Scotland" means to see terrific Forest Whitaker and his fascinating portrayal of the evil personified. His literally towering presence as Amin is both seductive and terrifying at the same time, something you will not forget easily.<br /><br />The film is not a bio-pic of Ugandan president Amin. It is more like a political thriller seen from the eye of fictional young doctor Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, recently leaving his country Scotland, and arriving at Uganda. Though he is nice as a person, it is suggested that his motive is not always honorable. The film spends some time to set up his character as na?ve and slightly callous doctor who does not know what he is doing. Actually many will find him annoying, but that is exactly the point.<br /><br />Before him and another doctor Sarah (Gillian Anderson, too brief appearance) President Amin shows up, cheered by the excited crowd. Then Garrigan is given a chance to treat Amin's minor injury, and Amin, who had recently seized the power, in turn invites him to his office and asks him to be his doctor. Amin says to Garrigan, "Uganda embraces you," but they young doctor finds the true meaning of it a bit too late.<br /><br />Director Kevin MacDonald, like his previous "Touching the Void," blends reality and fiction, but for "The Last King of Scotland" he leans more on `fiction' side of the script which includes several incredible episodes, like ones you might find in spy novels. Still the film looks often very real. It is actually shot in Uganda and its capital Kampala (by the photographer Anthony Dod Mantle, "28 Days Later") and the fate of Amin's second wife Kay (Kerry Washington) is based on truths.<br /><br />Though the film includes violence (torture scenes and one horrible death), the atrocity of Amin's regime is not directly shown on the screen. It is taken as granted that the audiences have already known the fact, and the film focuses on Amin himself who develops paranoia, perfectly presented by Forest Whitaker's great acting. The film is not perfect as thriller, but still that doesn't change the fact that Oscar-winning performance as President Amin alone is worth your time and money.</p></body></html>

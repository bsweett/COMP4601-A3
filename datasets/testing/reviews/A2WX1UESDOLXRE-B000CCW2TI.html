Perhaps you're sitting on a park bench and you see a jogger coming toward you and you wonder if maybe that jogger has a knife and is actually running aiming for you. That's the feeling I got when watching Red Eye-- an imaginative nightmare in which one bad thing leads to yet another bad thing. Someone's imagination apparently got the best of them when writing this movie. Yes, it's far-fetched, though that seems a petty reason to dislike this fun Friday night flick, as most movies are generally far-fetched.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams stars as Lisa, a hotel manager who's on a red eye flight back to Miami, the locale of her hotel as well as the place her father lives. In the airport, a friendly gentleman named Jack Rippner, ignore the silly, contrived name, (Cillian Murphy-- frightening in his aspect) buys the nervous flyer Lisa a drink before the flight. They part ways as their plane begins to board. But what do you know! Jack and Lisa are sitting next to each other. I love the trailer for this film. It's made to look like a romantic comedy, until the camera zooms in on Murphy's evil and powerfully piercing blue eyes. That's exactly what we get here: Jack is not a good person. As a matter of fact, he's going to kill Lisa's father if she refuses to authorize a change of room in her hotel for a politician, whom Jack is looking to assassinate.<br /><br />Very thrilling movie, great performances, especially from Murphy, though I don't expect anything less than creepy from him. The man radiates creepiness. Pictures of him make me cringe because I feel like his bright blue eyes are burning through my skin. A very fun film score as well; it works well, in all its hokiness, with the especially thrilling scenes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

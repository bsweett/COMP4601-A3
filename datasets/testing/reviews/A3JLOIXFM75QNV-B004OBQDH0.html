As much as I love the Harry Potter series, I was utterly dissapointed at the last two films. They strayed so far from the source material, I was quite honestly shocked and truly feared for the rest of he series. Well, I am pleased to say that Part 1 of Deathly Hallows is near perfection. High praise, yes, but I truly felt it did the book (at least the first part) justice. People have been complaining that not much happens and it is very slow-moving. Well, yes it is, but again, that is not so different from the book. The first part is a journey and sort of a teaser for the grand finale. Though not much action occurs, it is still quite interesting and truly suspensful. Especially if you've never read the books(which is just astonishing to me since they are a million times better than the movies).<br /><br />The characters are so grown up now and with that comes so much more emotion, and drama. The Half-Blood Prince contained too much humour, I thought. But Deathly Hallows Pt.1 contains just the right amount of everything. All the actors do an incredible job, even Dan Radcliffe, who I've always seen as the weakest link in the series. He's truly developed as an actor and did a wonderful job here. You can really feel the struggle these characters are going through on their journey.  It is just Harry, Ron and Hermione alone in the wilderness, trying to keep some sort of composure during their grim endevor. I do have to say one thing though: My favorite character in the series, Severus Snape, has literally one scene. I was extrememly dismayed but can only hope for more in the second part. Even with that one scene, he steals the show.<br /><br />The imagery is fantastic, the musical score is just right, the cinematography is first-rate. Aside from a couple of odd scenes, which were not in the book, I could really find nothing to complain about. I'm glad they decided to split the book, I think it was the best decision for this film and the entire series.</p></body></html>

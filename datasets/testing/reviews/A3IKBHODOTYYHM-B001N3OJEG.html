<meta name="summary" content="Noir film of the 90s"></head><body><p>The crux of L.A.Confedential's subject is the corruption brewing in the Los Angeles area during the 50s. The corruption comes in many forms: the police, organized crime, politics, and tabloid journalism. The film centers around three vastly different police officers: Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce),Bud White (Russell Crowe), and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey). Exley is a "by the book" officer who has ambition to be a great detective like his father. Bud White is an aggressive, hostile type with a short temper and a tendency towards violence. Jack Vincennes is a smooth talking, cool type who knows how to work the system, being in cahoots with the editor of the tabloid magazine.<br />When a brutal murder takes place at the Nite Owl restaurant, it seemingly links all three officers, who do some investigating on their own into what took place. What they find is a link to another world of serious corruption, where it is difficult to figure out who's being honest and who is a backstabber, what is lie and what is truth. There are cover-ups into crimes, and some police who have crossed over to the other side.<br /><br />If there was one annoyance, it was the voice-over  narration by Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), editor of Hush Hush magazine. Much of the character's narration didn't really add much to the story, because basically we knew everything he was narrating, so it was unnecessary. It just came across as a bit cheesy.<br /><br />Still, what makes L.A.Confidential work as noir is the mood created with the 50s atmosphere, the variety of detective types, and the building suspense as the film heads to its final confrontation. While the ending wasn't entirely original, the film was still one of the better films of the 90s, one to go back to.</p></body></html>

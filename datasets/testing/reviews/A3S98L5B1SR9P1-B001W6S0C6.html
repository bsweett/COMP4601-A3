<meta name="summary" content="Batman (1989)"></head><body><p>Batman is one of the best super hero films I've ever seen. Michael Keaton portrays the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman very convincingly as well as Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The story remains kind of vague at the beggining regarding Batman's origin, but as the film goes on it becomes more clear. The direction was really great for this film; I thought that Tim Burton really did a great job adapting the character for the big screen. The special effects are definitely the best I've seen so far for any super hero movie. Jack Nicholson a.k.a. the Joker is the best comic book villain to grace the big screen; I really can't see anyone portraying a better villain. Overall, the movie offers a very deep story about the Dark Knight and offers many action sequences to compliment the plot. I feel many Batman fans will love this movie as well as everyone else. Unfortunately, the last Batman film killed the franchise though.</p></body></html>

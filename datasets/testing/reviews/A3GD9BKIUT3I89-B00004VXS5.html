<meta name="summary" content="As it was meant to be seen"></head><body><p>Four decades after it's release the FULL version of Sergio Leone's epic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is finally being seen in North America.  Because the film was cut before it's U.S. release none of the footage was ever dubbed into English.  MGM/UA was able to secure the services of Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and someone to dub the late Lee Van Cleef so this saga is seen as it was meant to be seen.  Missing scenes include Tucco's meeting the three bandits, Blondie and Angel Eyes when the latter's gang appear, and several others.  Many of these scenes make up for gaps in the edited version.  A once terrific film is now truly great!Extra features include documentaries on Leone, the film and have interviews with Eastwood, Wallach and others.</p></body></html>

It put James Cameron on the map, it proved Arnold Schwarzenegger was not a one-hit wonder after "Conan the Barbarian" (1982), and it introduced the general public to Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.  It also reinforced the notion that vision and filmmaking ingenuity play a greater role in creating a quality film than exorbitant budgets and the casting of award-winning performers.<p>In the future, humankind is locked in a deadly struggle with machines that want to eradicate them.  The machines send back in time a robot (Schwarzenegger), dubbed a Terminator, to kill the mother of the man who will lead the human resistance against the machines.  They reason that by removing the mother from the timeline, the son who will battle them in the future will never come to be.  The woman the machines seek is a waitress named Sarah Conner (Hamilton).  Leaning of the plot against her, the human resistance tries to foil the machines' plan by sending back in time a lone soldier named Kyle Reese (Biehn).  Reese is charged with keeping Connor alive in order to preserve the timeline but that mission proves challenging as the relentless Terminator proves extremely adept at tracking down its prey.  <p>"The Terminator" can be interpreted as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, but to be honest it is better remembered as an exciting and entertaining chase film.  The energy generated by the pursuit of Sarah Connor is so intoxicating that any deep thoughts over the film's message is deferred until long after the end credits have finished.  Hamilton and Biehn are great in their parts but it is Schwarzenegger who steals the film.  He is perfectly cast and somehow manages to imbue his emotionless character with more charisma and humor than the average flesh-and-blood cinematic character.  Sure, the time paradoxes that the story poses might not stand up to close scrutiny when you think about it, the musical score is hopelessly dated, and the special effects are not top-of-the-line.  However, Cameron's determination to turn out a good product in spite of the limitations that confronted him comes through in every frame of "The Terminator."  Who would have ever guessed at the time of its making that this small film would continue to endure decades after its initial release?</p></body></html>

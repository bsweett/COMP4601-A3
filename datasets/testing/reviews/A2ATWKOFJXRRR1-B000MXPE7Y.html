<meta name="summary" content="A Fantastic Espionage/Spy Flick -- Just Don't Look For James Bond"></head><body><p>It's amazing that this film is so highly regarded, especially since we have Matt Damon as the lead character. Damon isn't known for his exciting acting abilities (with the exception of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0788814664">Good Will Hunting</a> which I consider his quasi-breakout role). He's established himself as Jason Bourne in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023B1LC">The Bourne Identity</a> franchise, but that doesn't take much acting ability and is almost purely a physical job. His character in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000062XHI">Ocean's Eleven</a> just seems to go through the motions. He's had limited success in films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001ZWUS">Saving Private Ryan</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed</a>. I say "limited" because it was the other characters and screenplay that brought him recognition more than his own abilities (try imagining Saving Private Ryan without Tom Hanks or The Departed without Leonardo DiCaprio and you'll see what I mean.) So I wasn't drawn to this flick simply because I knew Damon was our main man. But I was wonderfully surprised.<br /><br />Damon was the perfect choice for this role, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. His portrayal of Edward Wilson is flat, ineffectual, and unremarkable, just like the character was supposed to be. Just like many of Damon's previous portrayals. It is this absurd, unemotional character that drives the entire film, and thanks to director/actor Robert DeNiro's relentless pursuit of this movie (it was his pet project for over ten years) we have a gem.<br /><br />Beginning with Robert Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs debacle, the film shows Ed Wilson (Damon) trying to overcome an American/Cuban historical event that many find shameful. The CIA had a leak somewhere that blew the entire assault, and Wilson has to find out who and how. It will take him back to the very beginnings of the CIA, pre-WWII, and then slowly catch up to the1960's.<br /><br />Battling the Cold War with a very worthy Russian opponent, Ed must come to grips with the death of his father (who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.<br /><br />The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country. Dark corners are everywhere, including Ed Wilson's own home. Life and business blur. Separating the man from the mission becomes impossible. A panoply of scenes greets each moment of Ed's life, from the shadowy corners of Post-WWII Berlin to the recesses of his home sanctuary. It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.<br /><br />A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GBK904">Thirteen Conversations About One Thing</a>), Joe Pesci and William Hurt (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRM">Syriana</a>).<br /><br />Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone. But if you like to think about where the CIA came from and how espionage jobs really work, this one will be high on your list, too.</p></body></html>

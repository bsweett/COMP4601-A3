In the words of director Leonard Nimoy, "Trek IV" is a 'caper', an old-fashioned fish-out-of-water scenario in which the crew of the 'Enterprise' travel backwards in time to 1986 to capture a pair of humpbacked whales (extinct in their own era), the only creatures capable of answering the signal from a monstrous, towering probe which is orbiting 23rd century Earth and causing havoc on a worldwide scale. The ecological message may simply be a by-product of the clever script, but it underlines the narrative at every turn, making serious what might otherwise have been little more than a lightweight, throwaway entry in the long-running franchise.<br /><br />Though Kirk, Spock and McCoy necessarily hog the limelight, as usual, all of the secondary characters - Scotty, Uhura, Chekov and Sulu - play a vital role in the development of the story, and each one contributes a substantial element to the overall structure. It's good to see these hugely talented (and frankly under-appreciated) supporting players finally given an opportunity to strut their stuff on the big screen, and the results are by turns funny, dramatic and quietly moving. Favorite bits: Scotty's hilarious 'interaction' with a 20th century computer; and something which happens in the closing minutes before the end titles, surely one of the most rapturous, spine-tingling moments in the entire history of the Trek phenomenon. Poignantly, and without any trace of irony, this otherwise joyful movie is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger which met with disaster in 1986.<br /><br />By the way, UK prints of this movie open with a brief recap of events in Trek II and III (running 3m 30s) which is completely absent from the American version.<br /><br />Followed by STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER (1989).</p></body></html>

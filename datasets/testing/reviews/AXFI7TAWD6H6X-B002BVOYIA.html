<meta name="summary" content="A horrific tragedy"></head><body><p>"Hotel Rwanda" is based on the real life tragedy of the massacre in Rwanda in 1994. The focus point of the film revolves around real life hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina played by the wonderful Don Cheadle. Paul is put under a huge amount of stress when hundreds of Rwandans, namely those of the Tutsi tribe flock to his hotel for refuge. Instead of just putting together film from one point of view, writers Keir Pearson and Terry George wrote the film from all angles. Through out the film it is explained why the Hotu tribe has revolted against the Tutsis through radio broadcasts. It does not justify their actions but it certainly explained why their hatred for the Tutsi people. Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina was absolutely amazing with his subtle performance as the protanganist of the film. Sophie Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana was equally wonderful. There were time during the film when I felt that I was watching a documentary than a film based on a true life event. My heart was breaking through out the film as the body count rose from the massacres and Paul's reaction to the deaths of the locals. I loved this film because it did not preach or blame anyone for the atrocities, not to mention being biased. It simply told what happened without sounding preachy. What Paul Rusesabagina did took a lot of courage for saving over a thousand people and despite the countless deaths, he managed to remain calm and collected although he was pushed near the edge at the time. In my opinion, "Hotel Rwanda" should have won for best picture at this past Oscars. This film gives me faith that there are films out there that can entertain and move the viewer at the same time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Perspective On Peer Pressure"></head><body><p>This movie very accurately describes the trials and tribulations of five very different teenagers. Each of the five teens has critical issues that effect him or her and its is very interesting how each individual brings  can bring out reactions from the rest of the group.  Its almost like a teen  therapy session and in the end, each person seems to learn from one  another.  Judd Nelson gives a real killer performance as a troubled teen  trying to find happiness in a world that does nothing but dump on him.  His  humor seems to make him strong and impresses Molly Ringwald in the end.  Its intersting to watch these five as well as the teacher and custodian  evolve over the course of the movie.  The depth of this movie plus aspects  of both drama and comedy make The Breakfast Club one of my all time  favorites.</p></body></html>

The movie left a very strong impression on me, I must admit. If the crazy car chases and hyper-violent scenes are not enough for you, perhaps the incredibly faithful transcription from one medium to another that the story has gone through, in going from print to screen, will leave you as speechless as it left me.<br /><br />This reissue of the original theatrical version comes with a slightly alternate (unrated) version of the movie, which was recut and slightly extended in an attempt to make it even more like the original book. If you doubt that a movie can be faithful to a comic book (perhaps disappointed by earlier attempts in some Hollywood blockbusters), you will have a chance to follow the entire "The Hard Goodbye" story on the screen simultaneously with the included graphic novel... you will be amazed, I promise.<br /><br />As for extra material, there's plenty to wet the appetites of most fans of the genre, Rodriguez and Miller. From cuisine lessons (how to cook Breakfast Burritos) by Rodriguez; to an accelerated green screen version of the movie, where you can fully grasp the technical complexities in its shooting -not too far from how Episodes I, II and II were shot, mostly in the digital world-; there's something for everyone. So sit back, relax (if the movie lets you) and enjoy the Recut, Extended, Unrated version of Frank Miller's "Sin City".</p></body></html>

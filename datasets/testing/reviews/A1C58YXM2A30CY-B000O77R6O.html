Ambitious & Original SciFi"></head><body><p>Darren Aronofsky definitely made a pretty film -- the play of light and dark, shadow and substance (aka Rod Serling) create a real Twilight Zone. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5U5EE">Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection</a>  The film begins rather haphazardly and makes the viewer wonder what the heck is going on.  After rewatching the beginning again and paying a bit more attention (vital skill for this film) you see (a) the beauty of the photography and (b) the metaphysical theories of life and death.  Death being a journey to "awe", some Mayan mysticism <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587369982">Time & Transformation: A Novel of Mayan Mysticism</a>and some grief.  Some impossible purposes (finish the book, conquer death) and some interesting characters and chemistry.  Having Hugh Jackman <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CMLIJ6">X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a> here was an interesting choice:  never seen a man cry so much.<br /><br />Be prepared to wonder at the beauty of this film.  No other word for it;  pretty, aesthetic, almost steals the show.  Jackman plays three people at once; a conquistador in the 16 century, a medical practitioner in the present century and some far off future he's a shaman in a bubble (reminiscent of the plants-in-a-ship from "Silent Running") heading towards Shaballa, the nebula worshipped by the Mayans and now reincarnated Jackman (Tommy) becomes First Father and recreates the Mayan creation myth -- uhm, I think so anyway.<br /><br />Many conclusions, keeps you thinking, nearly as esoteric as 2001: A Space Odyssey <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> in a lot of ways.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The trailers and critics did not warn ME enough!"></head><body><p>WOW! Where to start....I was well aware of the subject matter of PAN'S LABYRINTH and the R rating( graphic violence) when a group of us saw it last night.What the oft-seen trailers and critics in the major city papers DID NOT tell me,though,was just HOW violent/gory/gruesome AND graphic this film was going to be.I truly have no problem with depiction of violence when it furthers the plot to clarify the points in the story,but I truly felt that much of the violence was gratuitous and unnecessary.We already had so many scenes of Captain Vidal's violent nature.How much is necessary to make a point and how much is TOO much?We artists are always balancing that one!!!Writer/Director Del Toro chose IMO the "over-the-top" route much like what many folks remarked vociferously about Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.Some may feel that ALL of the horror that is dealt to us in this film is necessary and essential.I do not.Sometimes what is NOT shown to us can be MORE LASTING than what is laid bare (REPEATEDLY) all the time.After so much gore, I actually "numbed out" and just wanted to get to the end of the film.<br /><br />NOW ON THE LIGHTER SIDE:(1) Javier Navarrete's soundtrack score is sublime and captures every moment of Ofelia's adventure without bringing attention to itself.This is the hallmark of a great soundtrack very much along the lines of Alexandre Desplats or Hans Zimmer where the viewer is AWARE of music,but overwhelmed by it.<br /><br />(2) Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is a marvel to behold.I was so atuned to her rapid breathing that it put me in mind of Poe's TELLTALE HEART.This child will hopefully grow into a great actress.<br /><br />(3) Maribel Verdu playing the Resistance-informer Mercedes was able to control so much of the horror she saw and yet remain cool enough to think ahead and not crumble under pressure.A GREAT ROLE and A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE.<br /><br />(4) Two of guys that were in our group noticed several shot/continuity problems ( because that is what they are PAID to do!) If they want to write reviews they can!<br /><br />Honestly, I have always said and practiced "To each their own!".This film could have been my cup of tea,but really just ended up,for me, a cup of blood.</p></body></html>

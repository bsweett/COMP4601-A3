<meta name="summary" content="Mystery River"></head><body><p>You know a film succeeds when you don't want to get up and go to the head.  Yes, there's a murder mystery and a psychological study of three men, boyhood friends in a lower-middle-class white neighborhood.  Sean Penn plays an ex-con turned businessman.  Penn wins the Academy Award for his role as this disturbed man with a motive to kill.  I don't think this part's a stretch for Penn.  Murderous jailbirds are his specialty.  Tim Robbins plays a disturbed man under soft skin, and he wins an Oscar.  Robbins always plays that soft-spoken whacko.  There's another stretch.  Kevin Bacon returns to his old neighborhood.  He's the homicide detective a little too wrapped up in neighborhood history.  I must admit, I had no idea who the real killer was till the last scene, but in truth, this plot MacGuffin's too much.  Hitchcock always left discernable clues.  In Mystic River, all the clues misdirect.  When the film was over, I was left with some disappointment.  The mystery was too clever, still, a good one, tense.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="director's cut blows"></head><body><p>People always gripe about Hollywood executives who smoosh directors' visions, but if this movie is any indication, they sometimes see things much more clearly than the directors.<br /><br />"Amadeus" has always been one of my favorite movies, but I've never had a copy.  Finally I thought, "Why not?" and ordered this.  Heck, let's get the director's cut, as that's bound to be better.<br /><br />No way.  The movie is much worse.  All those scenes that wound up on the cutting room floor?  Watch this and you'll realize why they were left there.  Constance's topless visit with Salieri poisons the emotion of the rest of the film, and many of the other scenes that were included slog the pacing and focus.  The original film made every point it wanted to make without any of them:  why couldn't they just have been added as "deleted scenes"?  Or why couldn't we have the option of seeing film "in original theatrical format" or "with deleted scenes interlarded" or something.<br /><br />Argghghghh.  Now somebody's gone and ruined one of my favorite films.  I'm going to have to go and buy the original somewhere.</p></body></html>

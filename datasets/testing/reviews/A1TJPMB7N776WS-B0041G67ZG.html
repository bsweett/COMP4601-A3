<meta name="summary" content="3 1/2 Stars The Bold and The Beautiful"></head><body><p>Physically beautiful, produced in a style that harkens back to the "big" movies of the 70's and 80's Sydney Pollack's (The Way We Were, The Day of the Condor) "The Interpreter" incites reactions from its audience for some of the wrong reasons. It's gorgeous to look at, it's directed to within an inch of its life, the actors look great and seem sincere and yet the experience is very much like eating Low-Carb Ice Cream: it just ain't the real thing...something is missing and that something is a decent script, which at the very least should make an honest attempt to piece together the disparate plot threads into a cohesive hole. No such luck: this script is muddled at best, incomprehensible at worst.<br />On the other hand Pollack directs a scene that is shot simultaneously on a bus, in several cars and features all the key actors that is terrifically exciting and makes you marvel at a style of film-making, both in the directing and the editing which can cause such a tremendously visceral reaction.<br />Also, on the plus side, Nicole Kidman as Sylvia Broome, a UN Interpreter with a dicey past, is so magnetic that your eyes follow her every move and when she begins to speak in KU, a made-up language of the ficticious Matobo people of Africa...you buy it hook line and sinker. Kidman once again plays the ice-queen but at least here she has a back-life that is mysterious, murky and ultimately spells trouble for all concerned.<br />Sean Penn as the Secret Service man assigned to investigate Sylvia, Tobin Keller seems to be stuck in a groove playing men who have recently lost something (21 Grams and The Assassination of Richard Nixon) or someone and are in deep despair and mourning. Here, Keller has just lost his wife 3 weeks before the film starts and he cries a lot of the time. Don't get me wrong: it's great to see this fine actor cry on the screen but Sean... do yourself a favor...do a comedy, what don't you? If  De Niro can, you can.<br />Catherine Keener does her, by now patented smart-ass, dry-witted best to add levity to the proceedings and for the most part she succeeds.<br />"The Interpreter" is a good way to spend an afternoon: it's pretty, it has good manners and it says please and thank you. I just wish it would have been less polite and kicked ass a little more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shallow River"></head><body><p>An over-publicized production that wallows in a predictably boring plot conveying absolutely no theme. I disagree with the critics who claim that this is more than a simple 'who dunnit' film. The plot and character development being so shallow and disjointed, it's hard to find any of the deep meaning the critics are raving about.<br /><br />  The acting of Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon,and Tim Robbins is overblown for such a mediocre screenplay. The mystery of who killed Sean Penn's daughter is rather predictable making the characters' attempts at solving it seem amateurish if not idiotic. The story also focuses too much on issues that arose between the characters in the past that have absolutely no manifestation or relevance with their present dilemmas: they might as well have been complete strangers and the story would have had the same impact: none. Although critics praise the film as a complex exploration into the human psyche one never really gets that impression from the film. The characters and plot are too poorly developed to comprise a meaningful character study. What does Tim Robbins' past as a victim of pedophilia have to do with anything in this story? Absolutely nothing. Although it functions as a plot technique for suspense, it could have been just about any other traumatic experience to make the character seem odd, evasive, and suspect. The film focuses too much on this and makes it appear an important element when it really has very little relevance. In sum, the film's plot and theme are poorly woven: they have little to no logical relationship to each other and comprise little else than big a non-sequitur in logical reasoning.<br /><br />  This film is but a shallow, if not dry, river bed of a story with no character or thematic depth whatsoever. This by far has to be the most over-rated film of 2003. It deserved no Oscars.</p></body></html>

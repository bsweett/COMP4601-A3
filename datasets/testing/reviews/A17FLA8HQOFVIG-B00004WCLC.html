<meta name="summary" content="An intense emotional experience with a few flaws"></head><body><p>This three hour film of several intersecting stories regarding various  tortured parent-child relationships set in modern California has some good  things going for it.<p>The directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (of Boogie  Nights fame) is superb.  He knows just where to cut, just where to add  tension, just when to do a close up probing a character's deepest  feelings.<p>The acting was outstanding.  The entire cast, including Jason  Robards, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H.  Macy and John C. Reiley were great.  Each part was meaty, giving the actor  ultimate opportunity to showcase his or her ability.  It's as if the writer  wanted to create good roles, and he certainly did.  Specifically, the roles  for aging men were outstanding.<p>The music was well used too, sometimes  introduced discordantly, creating and enhancing the several themes.<p>In  spite of its length, the movie wasn't boring as the audience kept craving  more and more of the unfolding several stories which were character driven  and intense with startling changes that kept me wide eyed and  interested,<p>However (and this is a big however), there were a few  elements that just didn't work.<p>There was a complicated introduction and  ending which was supposed to illustrate coincidence and destiny which left  me puzzled as to why it was there.<p>I never was able to figure out why the  movie was titled &quot;Magnolia&quot;.<p>And, after all the buildup and  tension and fine acting performances, about three quarters into the movie,  all the characters broke into a song which was totally out of place.  From  then, it was downhill all the way -- with a startling unexpected climax  that came out of the blue with no foreshadowing and made no sense  whatsoever.<p>This film is an intense emotional experience and will  undoubtedly have several well-deserved Academy Award nominations.  Too bad  it just doesn't hold together.<p>Recommended for film buffs for some of the  aspects that are nothing short of pure genius.  But if you're looking for a  story that makes sense, and a feeling of completeness, stay away.</p></body></html>

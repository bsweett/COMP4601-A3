It is a survival in the wilderness type movie, somewhat similar to "The Edge" with Sir Anthony Hopkins. It had my eyes GLUED to the screen, afraid to turn away for fear I might miss something. And I would watch this flick again, in a heartbeat! AND, I can't wait till the video comes out.<br /><br />The movie begins with shots of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and wolves howling, then you see frozen icy land.  Liam Neeson is a wolf sniper for a big petroleum company way up north.  Snow and ice is everywhere.  Neeson is missing his wife and has frequent visuals of her.<br /><br />In the very early beginnings of the movie, Neeson and other guys take a small plane to Archorage, Alaska and the plane goes down, crashing into frozen nowhere land.  Amidst the bitter temperatures, knee deep snow, icy waters, and brutal howling wind, Neeson and the guys attempt to survive.  But WAIT, there are vicious snapping, WOLVES, too, lurking around every corner!<br /><br />Shot amidst Vancouver and Alberta, Canada, including the beautiful Canadian Rockies, this is heart-thumping suspense.  When it was over, all I could say was "WOW!"<br /><br />BTW, watch the credits. Immediately after is a final shot that adds to the movie.<br />BTW#2 - Lots of blood so I do not recommend for younger children.</p></body></html>

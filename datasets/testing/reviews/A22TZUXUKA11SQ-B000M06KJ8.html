<meta name="summary" content="An entertaining historical movie with strong cast, direction, and costumes"></head><body><p>Sofia Coppola's version of Marie Antoinette focuses on the grandeur and opulence of Versailles, the strained relationship between Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and the repurcussions that their youth and wild ways had on the future of their country. When Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI meet they are mere children who know nothing about one another. For more than a year of their marriage they are virtual strangers who sleep in the same bed, but have yet to consummate their marriage. Louis is portrayed as a distant husband who cares more about his hunting and lock-making than the future of his country. Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a confused, spendthrift who attempts to mend the rift in her marriage by indulging in court gossip, stuffing herself with sweets, and spending copious amounts of money.<br /><br />As a whole, I enjoyed the film. I thought Kirsten Dunst was better than I've ever seen her (though I will allow that comparing this performance to Bring It On and Spiderman is a bit of a stretch) and the costumes, lighting, and direction were superb. I've never been a big fan of historical movies that are retold to suit the writers' purposes, but in this instance I was willing to look past it and just see that this was a well-made film. I do agree with some of the other reviewers, however, that the soundtrack left something to be desired. Although I do like a lot of the songs that were used in this movie, most of the time they seemed discordant with what was happening on screen. Still, as a whole this movie was entertaining and I think that's what's most important.</p></body></html>

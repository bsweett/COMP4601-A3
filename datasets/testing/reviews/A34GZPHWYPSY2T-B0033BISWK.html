For all that, I enjoyed it very much. Wouldn't really want to enjoy it a 2nd time. TV writer/director Neill Blomkamp is new at the helm. He deserves kudos for this as a 1st effort.<br /><br />Sharlto Copley plays priggish South African civil servant loser Wikus Van De Merwe, in charge of a specially designed concentration camp move for over a million extraterrestrials who have been camping in Johannesburg for two decades. They arrived, sat in Johannesburg's airspace for several months and were finally 'rescued' by the humans.<br /><br />This is inexplicable and rather stupid to start with, but we are told in a single rapid-fire line of dialogue that these are 'worker drones' without leadership. Hence they fall apart and are easily cowed into the slum created for them at the edge of town.<br /><br />Other than the ridiculous mockumentary style--which is a total waste here--this is just the beginning of a string of unnecessary stupidities. Van De Merwe's idiotic mugging for the "documentary" aside, I couldn't at any time see how that added to the film.They had a damned good idea here, and simply didn't run with it. As a friend of mine says, mom and dad went to bed and left the gas on....<br /><br />This film cannot go totally unpraised. The shooting was smooth, and better than I expected. The acting is top notch (except for the strangely dorky Copley), I loved seeing all those South Africans acting their hearts out, and the whole staging of it was rather compelling. That is why I lament them trying to make this look like some kind of Discovery Channel mess.<br /><br />There is little swearing (among other hilarious antics, one alien does let loose with a swear word, but then again, it is in "Alien", therefore subtitled). The aliens were the most endearing part of this, very believable yet borrowed right out of MEN IN BLACK. The alien mothership was stolen right out of the storage room for INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br /><br />Well, I advocate at least one watching of this...be warned that the accents are pretty thick, it is South Africa. (Yet a weird high-ranking individual is American.) If you are interested in the inane dialogue, you may not catch what they are saying the 1st time.<br /><br />You will not fail to be surprised and moved, even if you see it all coming because really, you've seen it all before.<br /><br />And that is the real shame of this film.</p></body></html>

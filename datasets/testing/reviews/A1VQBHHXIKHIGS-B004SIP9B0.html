Oh, do I hate the hype around that Princess Di bitch.  I wanna puke like a bulimic.<br /><br />I believe I heard this movie isn't always historically accurate, but I guarantee you it's true to the characters.  Brilliant performances by everybody, not just The Queen herself.  I laughed out loud at the understated yet biting British wit, and the drama was compelling despite being driven by, well, Di.  I love this movie.</p></body></html>

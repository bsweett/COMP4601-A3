<meta name="summary" content="Another Jewel From Wes Anderson"></head><body><p>I haven't seen "The Fantastic Mr. Fox"  but to my mind Wes Anderson hasn't missed a beat yet.  As a whole Anderson's collective works meld into an interesting observation on the quirks of men.  Marketed as a comedy, "The Darjeeling Limited" tackles heavy themes though Anderson's askewed humor is also present.  Topics like life, death, and the fragility of family bonds are present here.  There's a certain poignancy on display here.  This is a demanding film that I think would reward the most ambitious viewers.</p></body></html>

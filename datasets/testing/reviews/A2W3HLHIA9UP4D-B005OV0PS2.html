<meta name="summary" content="How did I miss out on movies like this for so long?!"></head><body><p>I just now recently watched this film, and I can't believe I waited this long to finally see it. This is a really good film..very funny..and in my opinion, the best Coen Brothers film..(though there's still a couple I haven't seen yet!) The basic plot that jump starts the film is kinda silly, but its so silly its great..then the story just evolves from there..from things getting bad to worse for "The Dude" and his friends! The performance of Jeff Bridges as this "dude" is classic. And don't forget John Goodman as the dude's bowling friend and sidekick, Walter. As with most Coen brother's work..the dialogue is hilarious and fantastic..especially the interacting of Bridges' and Goodman's characters. I just can't believe that I've missed out on this film for this long! Definitely recommended to anyone that enjoys funny dialogue and unforgettable characters!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The story telling may be a little off center, but Spacey is in true form and more than makes up for it..."></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey definitely carries this entire film on his very supportive back.  The film falls short in brilliance where a biopic is concerned but it excels in brilliance when entertaining the idea of a musical, a genre that is very hot or miss.  Spacey is infectious as he plays his real life idol Bobby Darin.  His moves are crisp and his voice is effortlessly beautiful to listen to.  The script though fails to truly uncover the man that was Bobby Darin.  We see his relationship with screen legend Sandra Dee, played by the beautiful Kate Bosworth, but we never really understand it.  The film seems to be more focused on telling the relationship between Darin's adult self and his child self, played by newcomer William Ullrich.<br /><br />Bosworth is notably fantastic as Sandra Dee though, her emotion fully invested in a character that is sadly left a little two-dimensional.  Bob Hoskins also shines; an actor who just continues to amaze me with every performance, each more poised and promising than the last, and here as Darin's brother-in-law he does a beautiful job juggling protective, compassionate and judgmental.  Caroline Aaron and the splendid Brenda Blethyn also illuminate their scenes, but no one is able to stop the tidal wave that is Kevin Spacey in full on shiny luminescent glory.<br /><br />The film, a dream project of Spacey's, follows Darin as he devotes himself to making a motion picture musical chronicling his life.  This I feel was done so that Spacey, an actor quite a bit older than Darin was in his prime, could justify starring in the film.  Darin in his older years is now starring as himself in his younger years in a film telling his life story.  I may have made it sound too complicated but it's not.  The set pieces are spectacular, the musical numbers are extraordinary and the acting as a whole is fulfilling and right on point.  The story telling itself though is a bit off.<br /><br />I recommend this biopic for the music itself, a true testament not only to the brilliance in the acting but also to the legend that is Bobby Darin, and Spacey here has created a wonderful example of how to reintroduce music of old to a new generation.  Spacey's determination and dedication to his performance makes every word jump out at you, makes every line swim in your ears for hours on end.  Even scenes as corny as his `Rub-a-Dub-Dub' music video are done with enough humor and sass that the audience is forced to appreciate it for what it is.<br /><br />`Beyond the Sea' may not be the most effective of the biopic's, and coming out in a year that sported some wildly successful and critically appraised films such as `The Aviator' and `Ray' may not have helped it none, but here is a classic example of an actor taking his passion for a performer, a legend and an inspiration and creating a whole knew feel from it.  To me Spacey one up's Foxx's Oscar winning performance by investing his very soul into Bobby.  Spacey didn't merely impersonate the man but he recreated him within himself and gave us Spacey the performer, the actor and the legend.  As a musical showcase `Beyond the Sea' sizzles and shines and is worth every fun filled minute.</p></body></html>

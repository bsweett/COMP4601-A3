Is this man an innocent victim or is he part of a conspriacy to frame Cruise ? On his way to find the truth, he meets new allies and old foes. He is also trying to find the where-abouts of his 10 year-old son who was kidnapped ten years prior.<br />This movie has a lot of suspense. The story held my attention from beginning to end. There is also a few scenes with great special effects. In my opinion, this is Tom Cruise's best film. Its much better than Impossible Mission 2.</p></body></html>

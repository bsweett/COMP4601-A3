<meta name="summary" content=""Great Sequel""></head><body><p>"Saw 2" is the 2005 sequel to the original "Saw" movie and has become the most financially successful "Saw" film in history. The movie pretty much follows the pattern of the first as people are kidnapped by the evil Jigsaw, in which he attempts to teach them not to take life for granted, albeit performed in a most inhumane and distorted way. There is blood, gore, yelling, screaming, and many plot twists that make "Saw 2" a worthy film to watch if your in the mood to be scared. In this movie a police officer's son is kidnapped by Jigsaw and it is heartbreaking to see the lengths in which a parent will go to save their son.<br /> Other sequels follwed "Saw 2" and most were huge boxoffice, but this and the original are the best in the "Saw" franchise. It seems that after the first two the plots became mundane and repetitive and 2009's version of "Saw", the last so far in the "Saw" films, was a boxoffice flop signalling perhaps the audience is tiring of Jigsaw and his demented actions.</p></body></html>

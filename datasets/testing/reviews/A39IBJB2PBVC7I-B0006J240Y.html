These heathens believe that the rational beings on earth are alone, unique among the galaxies, masters of all.  But The Forgotten begs to differ.  Indeed, individuals unwilling to concede that malevolent forces interfere in the lives of mankind and treat human beings with the same dispassionate cruelty scientists reserve for lab rats would have a hard time explaining the W. Bush administration.  But then, so would the W. Bush administration, should it ever feel the need to do so.<br /><br />Critics and audiences alike seem to have held The Forgotten up to a rather high standard and consequently missed the boat.  Undoubtedly this was due to the presence of Julianne Moore, a marquee actress.  They astutely pointed out the lack of concrete proof that space aliens control our lives!  They also pointed out that being the editor of children's books doesn't exactly qualify you to outmaneuver Federal Agents!  Zut alors!  Imagine this, improbability in a film!  However, they failed to light on the nice idea that memories themselves play a large role in shaping who and what we are - and stealing them away not only will drive us mad - it will make us malleable and easy to exploit.  This interesting notion is elegantly wrapped in a dressy psychological thriller that features good acting, cracker-jack special effects, and excellent pacing.<br /><br />Yes it is implausible that space aliens are using human beings as part of a science project to be presented at an inter-galactic parent's night.  But let's just say that the sci-fi angle is in there for purposes of plot convenience, and the "aliens" in question are the top 1% who very conveniently sit on the same boards of the same companies and shuffle quietly in between government posts and lucrative private sector appointments with an uncanny knack for attracting government contracts.  Does the idea of erasing collective memory seem quite as improbable now?<br /><br />The Forgotten is not a great movie, but it's a good and well made movie that's a lot of fun to watch - and recall.</p></body></html>

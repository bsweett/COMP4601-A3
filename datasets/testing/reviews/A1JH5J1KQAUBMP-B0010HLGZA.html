<meta name="summary" content="Holiday cheer from the director of "Porky's""></head><body><p>This is the story of a particular Christmas in the 1940s when little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wanted a genuine Red Ryder BB gun and was terrified that no one would get one for him.  This film has become a beloved holiday classic, but somehow I seem to be immune to its charms.  It's not a bad movie, but it seems more like a better-than-average TV movie than a Christmas perennial that actually won two Genies (Canadians Oscars) for direction and screenplay.  However, I'll grant that the scene with the department store Santa is a classic.<br /><br />I guess I have to put this on the same list as "Vertigo," "E.T.," and "Blow Up"--movies beloved by so many that just don't do it for me./</p></body></html>

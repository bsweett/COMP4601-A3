It is clear to me that &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is regarded as the standard Christmas eve broadcasting in the US. It seems  that many Americans regard this film as worn out, in the same way as say  &quot;The sound of music&quot; has been, through too many viewings. To the  best of my knowledge it has only been broadcast once in the last ten years  in OZ, (I've been informed that's not strictly true, but why spoil the  story), and that time was not advertised. So perhaps I am in a better  position to judge the true worth of this film, not having been overexposed.  I regard it as one of my top ten of all time. The cast is fabulous. James  Stewart was perfect in his central role as George Bailey. Although I would  rate his performance in &quot;Mr. Smith goes to Washington&quot;, slightly  higher. The story is brilliant and the direction is immaculate.<br /><br />I  was lucky enough to get one of the 45th anniversary copies of the  re-mastered laser disc and it is a beautiful transfer. If you ever want to  add this film to your collection, this is the copy to get. If you are not  crying through at least half of this film, both in joy and anguish, then I  think there is something wrong with you. I certainly got more out of this  film than any rendition of Dickens', &quot;A Christmas Tale&quot;. After  all how many of us can empathize with a penny pinching self centered old  grouch versus a good man faced with letting his family and friends down.<br /><br />That is the basic story after all. George Bailey has been dealt a  savage blow and is contemplating suicide at his lowest ebb. It takes an  apprentice angel to put it all in perspective and remind him that joy in  life should never be eclipsed by any setback. Maybe those Americans out  there that have not taken the time to watch &quot;It's a Wonderful  Life&quot; in the last ten years should stop and try to recall the story.  If you can't, then you should make the time to give it another chance. You  may be surprised at the power it still has to move you.</p></body></html>

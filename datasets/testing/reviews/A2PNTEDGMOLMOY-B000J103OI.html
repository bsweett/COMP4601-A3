<meta name="summary" content="Pedestrian "girl comes of age" story elevated by the magnificent Streep"></head><body><p>"The Devil Wears Prada," based on the famously-hilarious novel, is a fairly conventional, if glossy, coming of age tale.  Despite a pretty funny script (watered down from the book) and the usual acting talent present in a major Hollywood production (Anne Hathaway in the title role, Stanley Tucci as a flamboyant designer, etc.), the movie is saved from mediocrity by the performance of Meryl Streep.<br /><br />This wonderful actor, who made her name in such "difficult" movies as "The French Lieutenant's Woman" and "Kramer versus Kramer," sinks her teeth into the role of Miranda Priestley, the editor in chief of "Runway," a fashion magazine.  Priestley has dyed her hair the charming color of steel on a cold day and is one of the leading lights of the fashion world.  She also is the most demanding and unreasonable boss since Kevin Spacey in "Swimming With Sharks."  To say that Streep takes on this role with glee is an understatement.<br /><br />But Priestley is the villain of this piece (or is she . . .).  The heroine is Andrea Sachs (Ms. Hathaway).  A recent graduate of Northwestern University and editor of the prestigious student paper, Ms. Sachs has come to New York with hopes of writing for Vanity Fair or The New Yorker.  Thanks to the screenplay, Andrea gets a job that she doesn't want but is one - as she is told repeatedly - that "a million girls would kill for."  This is one of those "too-good-to-be-true" situations one encounters only on movies or TV - kind of like the apartment on "Friends."  But it's needed as a plot device - you couldn't tell a coming-of-age story about a girl who knew that a million girls got the job and still got the job, because that girl knows how the world works.<br /><br />So commences the education of Andrea.  At first, Andrea - like many in the audience - looks down on the fashion world as super-silly fluff.  Things begin to change as she sees what a dynamic business mind Miranda has, and also when Miranda gives Andrea the detailed fashion history of the frumpy blue sweater she wore to work that day.  Eventually, Andrea sees the light, and after a helpful fashion lesson from Stanley Tucci, starts to wear great clothes and also stop eating so she can become a reasonably satisfactory size 4.<br /><br />This sets up a typical scenario where Andrea starts to lose her old friends to the demands of her job.  Her boyfriend - who looks 18 but will end up becoming the sous chef for a pretigious restaurant (yeah, right) - is typically unsupportive.  The only friend who showed promise was a guy who showed an unnerving fascination with fashion, but that subplot goes nowhere.  But these friends serve as the counterpoint to Miranda, setting up the ultimate choice for Andrea - who does she want to be?  Rich, famous and unhappy, like Miranda?  Or herself?  Ten cents if you guess who she wants to be.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is what is unsatisfying about the movie.  Miranda is not unhappy - she loves who she is and wouldn't be anyone else.  It's just for Miranda, things like a marriage come second.  But we never get a sense of who Andrea wants to be - she's nice, but we see nothing of what animates her as a journalist.  Does she want to be a globe-trotting foreign correspondent?  A literary critic?  An advice columnist?  We are left to wonder, but then we already know that we are more interested in Miranda than Andrea anyway.<br /><br />A fine movie for the younger set - a lot of young people could benefit from even the most shallow bit of introspection.  But if you're looking for a great movie, skip "The Devil Wears Prada."  That is, unless you want to watch Meryl Streep give a master's class in acting.</p></body></html>

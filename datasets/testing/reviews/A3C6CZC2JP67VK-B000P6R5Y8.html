<meta name="summary" content="Can our imagination become reality?"></head><body><p>When I was a kid, I wanted the world to work that way. I wanted the trees to talk back, war with imaginary villains, and fly with the birds. I really felt it and so did the main characters of the story.<br /><br />Josh Hutcherson, who is no stranger to acting already, starring in 15 plus films plays quiet and artistic Jesse Aarons who usually finds himself the [...] of jokes by the loud and obnoxious fellow students at his public school. Hutcherson is terrific and such an amazing lead actor in this film. I think kids will love watching him and really relate to his situation and really respect him and follow him. I hope he continued to get some really great roles. Also really terrific is AnnaSophia Robb who plays unique dreamer Leslie Burke who befriends Jesse and together they have incredible adventures together and form a lasting friendship. AnnaSophia is such a sweetheart and really does bring Leslie to life as this carefree, deep thinking, happy, spirited little girl. She really is the perfect Disney girl and probably has a promising career as such ahead of her. Also terrific is 8 year old Bailee Madison who plays the irrepressible and adorable May Belle Aarons who is really heading towards the same fate that Jesse finds himself in, in the real world. Jesse takes her under his wing and shows her the magic world that him and Leslie have created. Robert Patrick is also just terrific as the Aarons' father, Jesse Sr. Patrick's character is not a bad guy at all!! In fact he is desperately trying to provide for his family, and has simply been worn by the world around him. He wants his children to be raised to be strong providers especially his only son. The supporting cast is also terrific with key performances by Zooey Deschanel, Lauren Clinton, and Cameron Wakefield.<br /><br />The movie bounced back and fourth between the friend's school life and their imaginary world. The two loved each other more than anyone could love and didn't even show it with a kiss. This movie should of been longer. 90 minutes seems to be the typical time for a movie but this one probably needed 15 minutes more. I wanted to see more of their world as it showed just a fair amount in my opinion (kind of like how Pan's Labyrith was - great film by the way). Movies are marketed different now a days and some viewers may be disappointed. I saw this movie more as drama than an adventure.<br /><br />I never read the book but I'm hearing Disney kept it very similar to it. I like that a lot as I hear "Eragon" wasn't even close. This isn't a better fantasy film I've seen in years, I just wish they had more but still a movie to see with the kids.</p></body></html>

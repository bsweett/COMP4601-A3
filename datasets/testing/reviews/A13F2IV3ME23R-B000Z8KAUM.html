[or I wasn't in the mood for this movie].<br />Action.  What did I miss?<br /><br />Danger: again too subtle.<br />I did get the jist of the story.  Just too slick - Am getting bored with Las Vegas.<br /><br />See it if you want - but may take more than once to finally figure it out.</p></body></html>

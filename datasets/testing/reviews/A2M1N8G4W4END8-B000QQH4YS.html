<meta name="summary" content="He's Part Man, Part Machine.  But He's All Cop."></head><body><p>After a Detroit police officer (Peter Weller) is sadistically murdered by a group of thugs sometime in the near future, he is resurrected--well, sort of--when his head and brain are used as the CPU of the latest law-enforcement experiment: RoboCop, a high-tech cyborg police officer designed to be impervious to corruption and nearly indestructible.  RoboCop is a very effective law-enforcement tool, but when the thugs that killed him try to thwart the cybernetically revived policeman, their efforts backfire as they inadvertently unlock his repressed humanity and thereby make him an even better cop.  Thus goes the basic plot of 1987's ROBOCOP.<p>Though many filmgoers don't seem to &quot;get it,&quot; ROBOCOP is more than an action or sci-fi flick; it is actually a dark comedy.  Or rather, a darkly humorous satire.  Director Paul Verhoeven and writers Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier take pokes at several American institutions and subcultures, not the least of which are law enforcement, corporate politics, goverment, and mass media. In addition, they satirize a popular science-fiction and comic-book vision of the future, one in which society at large decays to near anarchy while science and private business still manage to crank out high-tech toys.  It could even be argued that, on a broader level, ROBOCOP is a parody of the popular 1970s TV show THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN, with RoboCop as a dime-store reflection of the cyborg Steve Austin and corporate lackeys and degenerate street thugs filling in for the various threats to the American way of life.<p>The special FX in ROBOCOP are pretty cool, especially for their time, and the acting is just fantastic.  Die-hard genre fans will no doubt recognize star Peter Weller from 1984's THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8th DIMENSION, as well as numerous other sci-fi and horror flicks.  In his performance as the titular character in ROBOCOP, he does a perfect job running the gamut of human emotions as he goes from man to robot to a cyborg who regains his humanity.  The adorable Nancy Allen is very effective as RoboCop's human partner, as she emotes genuine concern when she recognizes the human portion of RoboCop and subsequently helps him to get in touch with his humanity.  Genre fans may recognize her from her supporting role in Brian De Palma's CARRIE (1976) and co-starring roles in 1981's BLOW OUT and 1983's STRANGE INVADERS.  Other good supporting performances are delivered by veteran actors Ronny Cox (1972's DELIVERANCE and 1990's TOTAL RECALL), Kurtwood Smith (Red Forman on TV's THAT '70s SHOW), Miguel Ferrer (the 1994 TV mini-series THE STAND), and Ray Wise (1982's SWAMP THING and TV's TWIN PEAKS).<p>As one would expect from a movie depicting a grim future, ROBOCOP is very violent and there are some pretty gruesome scenes.  Fans of sci-fi action flicks or slasher films will probably not get put off the gruesome killing of Officer Murphy (who becomes RoboCop), and they may actually enjoy the scene where a thug starts melting after getting dowsed with toxic waste.  But the average viewing audience may want to consider the high level of graphic violence when deciding whether or not to view or purchase this film.<p>The no-frills DVD from MGM offers a nice widescreen transfer of the film but no extras.  Still, it's cheap enough that frugal sci-fi fans should grab it up for their collections.  The Criterion Collection DVD offers lots of extras--including a feature commentary from the director and other crew members, trailers and TV spots, and more--but its steep price may deter all but die-hard ROBOCOP fans.</p></body></html>

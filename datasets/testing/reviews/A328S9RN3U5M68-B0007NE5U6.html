<meta name="summary" content="Solely out of Curiosity..."></head><body><p>Having seen trailers of both the Bridget Jones films in theaters (and being grateful at not having spent the theater price for this duo), renting the DVD was for one reason only: could these films be as bad as they appeared in trailer or was there really a reason they were successful?<br /><br />When a cast of the order including Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Hugh Grant,  Colin Firth, Renee Zellweger, and Jacinda Barrett, there must be a reason for this group to consent to participate in this mindless mess.  Money, I suppose, because there doesn't appear to be another reason.  The script is poor at best, the 'fat actress' concept and poor accent that besiege Renee Zellweger's attempt to create a credible comic character is ludicrous, and the obvious big budget/multi-location squandering of production costs is shameful.  Sad that there is an audience for this type of film.  Maybe others can be entertained by this escapist route, but the smarmy digs at characters embedded in lesbian or Thai prisoner roles etc are in poor taste and definitely not funny.<br /><br />Let's hope there are no plans for the further lack-of-adventures of this fatuous Bridget Jones idea.

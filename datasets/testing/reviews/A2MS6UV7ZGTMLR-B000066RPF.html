What do you get when you give about ?230,000 to a couple of debutante directors and the rest of the members of the greatest comic collective the world has ever seen? Monty Python And The Holy Grail!<br /><br />Monty Python And The Holy Grail is a truly great film and in particular a truly great comedy - to still generate laughs even after repeated viewings.<br /><br />What is the film about? King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is seeking knights to join him in the court of Camelot, and after some run-ins with the French, eventually gathers together Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Chaste (Michael Palin) and Sir Robin the Not So Brave (Eric Idle). After not returning to Camelot for reasons well detailed in the film, the knights are confronted by God who gives them an awesome task - to find the Holy Grail. Now the fun really begins! They have to confront the dangers of The White Rabbit and The Bridge Of Death in order to seek what they hope to find. Many months pass before the possibility of success finally arrives. But then again, perhaps not. In case you are wondering, Terry Gilliam plays the part of Patsy - Arthur's "horse" - but like everyone else also plays a bunch of other parts, so typically Monty Python. Not so typically Monty Python is the fact that apart from Dennis's mother, all female parts are actually played by females!<br /><br />With classic comedy scenes aplenty - you must have seen the Black Knight scene surely? - that still are as funny today as they were twenty five odd years ago, this is truly a gem of a film. What this bunch of comic geniuses managed to achieve on a shoestring budget remains one of the pre-eminent comedy classics, ranking up there with the likes of Buster Keaton's The General. Okay, it looks cheap and nasty at times, but you really would be hard-pressed to make any complaint - there are plenty of way over-budget Hollywood pieces of tripe that could not even approach the delights of this film with one hundred times the budget. And this was but one of their classic films! When you add into the mix a collection of some of the funniest gag subtitles during the opening credits, the inspired surprise opening and everything else, this is a true classic DVD release.<br /><br />Monty Python fans have been awaiting this sort of local release for far too long and to finally have it is to emphasise why. Whilst the film urges you to run away frequently, the only direction you should be running is towards your nearest DVD retailer to order this DVD. Brilliant stuff all through, and an essential purchase for any DVD collection.</p></body></html>

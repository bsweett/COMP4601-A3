<meta name="summary" content="Four Brothers...make their point"></head><body><p>Four Brothers is the latest film by director John Singleton who back in the early 90's made Boyz N The Hood to a mass of critical and audience acclaim.<br /><br />Singleton's newest feature stars singers turned actors: the already veterenated actor Mark Wahlberg, Outkast's Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, and the up and coming actor Garrett Hedlund as four adopted brothers who return to their old neighborhood and home in Detroit after their foster mother is shot to death at a local convenient store to seek revenge.<br /><br />The movie attempts to mix light humor in its dialogue while turning the knob up on the anger, melancholy and frustration the boys endure as they are out to get the guys who killed their beloved gaurdian. There are the usual twists and turns along the way but the revenge remains very straightforward, Singleton style.<br /><br />There are no over the top performances by any of our main characters including the supporting cast that features Terrence Howard, who just recently shined in the Singleton produced Hustle And Flow, and Josh Charles, but the movie makes its point by succeeding in grabbing your attention even through the usual revenge/action-movie cliches that it's filled with.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B-</p></body></html>

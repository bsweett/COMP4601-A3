<meta name="summary" content="GRITTY INSPIRING EPIC NOBLE"></head><body><p>A twist on the many Arthurian movies, focusing on the Historical context where Arthur was likely a Roman leader of some sort who stayed when most of Rome fled. Quite gritty for the faint of heart but realistic in its battle scenes.  Moves fast. Good characters and a fine climatic battle at the end.<br /><br />Lancelot played by the same actor who played Horatio Hornblower.<br /><br />Director's cut more interesting as it shows the movie ending and the director's preferred ending which is a bit less glory glory we rule attitude.<br /><br />If you want more of the faerie tale telling of this, either read T.H. White's THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING and see EXCALIBUR, which has a very small acting role for Liam Neeson as Sir Gawaine.  Of all the King Arthurian movies, Excalibur had it right and was even based on a famous book.</p></body></html>

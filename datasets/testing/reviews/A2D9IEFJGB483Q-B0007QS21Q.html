<meta name="summary" content="Hardwiring problems in a good film."></head><body><p>I'm not sure why they retagged "Hardwired" as "I, Robot."  Will Smith has enough star power, and is a bona-fied sci-fi actor that they had no reason to drag Asimov into the production.  Furthermore, this name game hurt not only the film franchise, but also the novel's good names.  How can they do a film version of "Caves Of Steel" or even the "Foundation" novels if we have this out-of-place script.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Asimov, but then again, all sci-fi is a tribute to the masters: Wells, Verne, Doc Smith, and Asimov.  It would have been much better for continuity's sake to keep "Hardwired" as its own, separate franchise and name. Think of the spin-off, sequels, and TV series that they could have had, without offending all of the die-hard Asimov fans.<br /><br />As to the film, it is great, except for the first fifteen minutes of product placement.  I guess they put it at the beginning because the people who fall for that tend to have short attention spans. Anyone up for boycotting these products?<br /><br />This movie is a tribute to Asimov, so it feels like an Asimov story, but is more of a reaction piece and a distillation to all of Asimov's robot stories.  I almost want to say that after seeing this movie, you have read all of his robot books.<br /><br />I was also reminded of Tom Selleck's 1984 film "Runaway," where he plays a sanitized and popularized Bladerunner.  Intellectually, "I, Robot" is head and shoulders above both of those films.  It makes you think about rules and how we would possible control these robots, and how we could misuse them.<br /><br />"Bladerunner," by comparison, is too self-conscious of its cerebrally, and is too mystical.  It feels like a prologue to the Matrix-as if we haven't seen enough of that film already.<br /><br />I think this film serves as flint to spark one's interest in the novels-they are always better.</p></body></html>

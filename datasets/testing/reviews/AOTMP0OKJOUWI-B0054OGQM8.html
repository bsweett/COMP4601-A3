<meta name="summary" content="Must for the fans"></head><body><p>I think we all know by now the true fans have the DVD versions of something (really big fans with money have Blu-Ray or whatever).  This is a great collection of what I think is one of the best trilogies ever made. It's fun, actiony, with plenty of humor and random and contradictory sci-fi. What more could you want?  The three movies are there, plus the usual fun assortment of bonus features.  Great collection.</p></body></html>

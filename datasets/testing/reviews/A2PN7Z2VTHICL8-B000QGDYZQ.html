<meta name="summary" content="When reality gets slippery ..."></head><body><p>'Premonition' is a suspense film that scores a little low on the suspense-o-meter.  Linda Hanson (the fabulously talented Sandra Bullock) and her husband Jim (Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck) have a happy life.  Nice home, two beautiful daughters, and a loving marriage.  Then Jim dies in a car accident, leaving Linda trying to cope with her loss.<br /><br />But, when she wakes up the next morning, Jim is alive again, just like his death never happened.  But Linda remembers everything from the day before.  The film leaves you wondering which side of Linda's life is the real side, the one where she wakes up and Jim is alive, or the one where she wakes up and he's dead.  Small occurrences happen that tie the two realities together, such as a prescription from a psychiatrist and an accident with her oldest daughter.<br /><br />The suspense of the movie never reaches a gut wrenching level, and the soundtrack became annoying at times with its consistent "doom-and-gloom" sounds.  It seems as if there's a message hidden that some things are in our control, and some things are not.  The ending was a little too clich&eacute;d for my tastes.<br /><br />Overall, the movie just didn't quite live up to its promises, but the performances by Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon are exceptional, carrying the weaker direction of the film.  It's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.  Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

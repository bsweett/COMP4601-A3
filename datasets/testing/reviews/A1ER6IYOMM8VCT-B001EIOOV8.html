<meta name="summary" content="GREAT 5 STAR MOVIE BUT......... THE DVD IS DEFECTIVE! 1 STAR :-("></head><body><p>I love this movie! The problem is I have a very expensive DVD player and this movie freezes about two hours into it! I play it in one of my cheapo players and it works fine. They need to fix this problem by letting everyone return it for a nice new 15th anniversay edition! I have read numerous complaints about this problem and it is inexcusable!</p></body></html>

Discovering it on DVD, I immediately thought that the critics were a little hard on the movie when it premiered in theaters.  It's not that they were wrong about some of its shortcomings: Pierce Brosnan's singing is indeed not very good; there's a noticeable overreliance on obvious studio recreations of outdoor sets when they could have just used the actual outdoor sets; and or two other nitpicks.  But any flaws are just that, nitpicks, not fatal elements that should drive a viewer away.  I will say that the movie didn't catch fire up to its full potential, based on all the footage of screaming, joyous fans seeing the stage version that is peppered throughout the special features and promo spots on the DVD, but things are energetic enough.  And several of the secondary characters- especially Meryl Streep's two girlfriends- were a little cartoony for my tastes.  But again, nitpicks.  Just enjoy the scenery, music, and romance.  That's what one wants from a film like "Mamma Mia!", and that's what is enthusiastically delivered.</p></body></html>

Predator is a hell of a ride, and this is about muscles, guns, blowing up things, intelligent scripting, principles, values, honor, teamwork, an awesome villain, and big muscles. Arnold Schwarzenegger is certainly an irreplaceable actor because everything he does in films like Predator and The Terminator makes him a fluid-like action star. There are huge amounts of muscles throughout the film, starting with Arnold, and then onto Carl Weathers, Jesse "The Body" Ventura, and Sonny Landham. Ironically, the last two stars and Arnold himself made runs for state governorships, and two of them have won. How often a film goes by where there could have been three governors in a film that has the idea of a B-movie when in fact is a five-star picture? How often a film like Predator comes out seamlessly perfect? Thousands of films out there have tried to do what Predator achieved and failed miserably. Why is that? Because it is a work of a director with an artistry vision. John McTiernan succeeds in Predator and then takes what he can and applies it to Die Hard. This Predator is an awesome villain, not so much different from the Terminator, and is a unique one as well. Ever since I saw this movie first, I've always considered Predator one of the best action-adventure pictures made, and this still stands strong today. Considering how badly movies have been made today, nothing holds up to the level the same as Predator. One example, a great one, is the difference in facial expressions between Predator and innumerable of so-called action-adventure pictures. Usually, in the latter, characters would have this serious look throughout the time and be stuck with it. I've always found it stupidly unrealistic while I appreciate the honesty and human nature of the looks on the characters. I could actually tell by their looks if something serious was happening, or they just ease down. It is really of a very monumental importance because they aren't machines but humans just like us. So, those men, while packing an awesome amount of firepower and muscles, try to do their jobs as given, and the leader made a conscious task to find the suspicious creature before it gets unleashed into the world of civilizations. While the movie actually starts at the 45th minute, the action is just perfect in Predator, and it's undoubtedly one of the most suspenseful thrillers made. I loved the twenty minute mano a mano ending where I felt bad that Arnold's character got shot and pretty much was worried that he might get spotted before getting killed for sure. Yet the Predator couldn't see him. That's quite astounding. While at that, I loved how the characters were able to convey on what they've learned about their adversary. As I said, the script is excellent, and a few of the lines are very memorable. If it bleeds, we can kill it...I ain't got time to bleed...You're one ugly m**********r. Lastly, not to forget to mention, the special effects featured in the movie is breathtakingly well-crafted. Just brilliant stuff. I've said that The Seven Samurai was way too long and that The Magnificent Seven was a magnificent bore, but Predator is the best of all. I will always return to Predator time after time and just simply enjoy it for hell of a time. Starts out with a simple plot, Predator turns into something else more complex because of one and only one simple twist in the story. That's why it's a real winner. When Dutch gets off the chopper, the hum-vee jeeps driving over the water...that's a nostalgia moment. Even better, how about that moment when Dillon throws his arm to Arnold's and I get to see the huge pumps out of that one? It's a classic. Even so is the huge massacre of the jungle trees. That was, on a scale of one to ten, an eleven.<br /><br />10/10: Predator is the one of the best sci-fic horror pictures made of any time. The And Then There Were None is sublime, and Predator makes for a far more entertaining flick than The Seven Samurai. I also think it is an underrated flick and is gaining steam as of lately as a respected classic. There is a lot of memorable moments and also liners in Predator that are well-known among fans of the film. That makes Predator a more exciting movie to watch again and again. What I love about it is the subtle diversion of the plot. At first, it was a simple rescue effort but quickly turns to be a much more complicated matter than that. Then, another subtle thing about the film is the usage of brains over brawn. Yeah, nearly all of the characters were loaded with muscles and testosterone, but they got killed too easily regardless. Once they put the clues together and understood what kind of an enemy they were facing against, they came to realize it was a grave situation. That's why they stayed and try to save the world from this alien visitor akin to the situation of John Carpenter's film The Thing. The conclusion becomes inevitable, but intelligence saved the day for the humans. Lastly that I lover about the movie is the blending in of the infrared perspective of the alien visitor. Most films trying that technique would fail badly, but John McTiernan made it to work and allowed the film to be more interesting this way. All in all, Predator is an outstanding picture and is already a classic. I am raising the rating from `9' to `10'.</p></body></html>

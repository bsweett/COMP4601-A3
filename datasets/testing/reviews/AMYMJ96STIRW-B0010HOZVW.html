While this kind of thing would be great, if people like this were available in our society, they are not. But, for those of us who are disgusted with what our society, particularly in cess-pool cities like New York, has allowed inself to become, this movie is a great catharsis and a stunning triumph of the human spirit. Jodie Foster showed herself to be on top of the league of actresses available today.<br />Higly recommend to people of all ages, but young people should be told that is not a really possible way to handle horrible crimes...I think!?!</p></body></html>

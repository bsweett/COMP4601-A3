Interesting dialogue, great acting, cool camera work and an intriguing plot. But you have to get the anniversary edition; the tribute to Lawrence Tierny alone is worth it! And I agree with the one reviewer who was disgruntled over buying the "regular" DVD only to discover a special edition was coming later. That's simply unfair and greedy. Although truth be told, the extras on Pulp and Jackie are interesting, but nothing except the most rabid Tarintino fan would lose any sleep over.</p></body></html>

Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are electric as a married couple with some "relationship problems". First off, this film has a lot of sex and nudity but what saves this film is the amazing musical score during that infamous "you know what" scene. This was Stanley Kubrick's last film before he died, there are some beautiful and breathtaking moments like the flashing Christmas lights on the streets of New York City. Sydney Pollack's performance was very aggravating, it takes him like 15 minutes to complete a full sentence! I enjoyed this slow burn of a film, I definitely had my eyes wide open than closed for sure!</p></body></html>

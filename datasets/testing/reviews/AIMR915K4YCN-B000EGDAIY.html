Of course, I had just seen THE RING, which made THE GRUDGE seem like a clone thereof. Well, I recently watched the extended, director's cut of THE GRUDGE and it is a tad spookier. One thing that puzzles me is why the many deleted scenes were not incorporated into the finished product. Quite a few of them are as scary as anything in the movie! They also add to the overall story in key places. Oh well, at least these scenes are included on the DVD. I recommend this director's cut AND the deleted stuff. Sarah Michelle Gellar is very believable in her role as caregiver, Karen Davis. The rest of the cast is equally good, especially the gal who plays Kayako! When she crawls down those stairs, making that accursed gurgling sound, my body temperature drops 10 degrees! Crikey!...</p></body></html>

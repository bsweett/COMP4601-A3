It starts off nicely enough, but started to unravel with a bad storyline and acting alike. The revelation about the mother, and the truth about the father just ruined the movie. For a classic and great werewolf movie, watch '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4E">An American Werewolf in London</a>'.</p></body></html>

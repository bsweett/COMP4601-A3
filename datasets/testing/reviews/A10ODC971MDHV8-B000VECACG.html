<meta name="summary" content="Close Encounters of the Third Kind"></head><body><p>Top science fiction entry boasts Spielberg's trademark epic sweep, and one of Dreyfuss's shining moments as the afflicted Neary. Director Truffaut is on-hand in a rare acting turn as French scientist Claude Lacombe, and Melinda Dillon excels as bewildered Mom Jillian, whose young son Barry (in a petrifying scene) has already gone up in the aliens' space ship. Don't miss this classic Spielberg spellbinder.</p></body></html>

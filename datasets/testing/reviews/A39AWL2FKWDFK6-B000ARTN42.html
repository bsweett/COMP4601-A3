<meta name="summary" content="Another Ron Howard gem"></head><body><p>Despite using every conceiveable cliche Ron Howard's embellished for Hollywood biopic "Cinderella Man" was an important flick that was highly entertaining.  Supported by an outstanding cast, the film depicts the rise to glory of New Jersey heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock.  Braddock fabulously played by the versatile and svelte Russell Crowe was a boxer of above average skills but the determination and tenacity of a bulldog.  He served as an important symbol, a beacon of hope, to throngs of impoverished and destitute people in the throughs of the Great Depression of the late 20's and early 30's.<br /><br />The movie commences with Crowe and his wife Mae played by an accomplished Renee Zellweger,enjoying the fruits of his labor in a comfortable New Jersey home after a boxing victory.  We are quickly fast forwarded 4 years into the future where the Depression has robbed the Braddocks of their home and good fortune.  They are now living in a squalid basement flat with three children trying to keep food on the table.  Braddock's boxing career is in a swoon and he attempts to sustain his family by working on the docks of Hoboken, when there is work.<br /><br />Howard does an excellent job portraying the hopelessness and disconsolate nature of the depression as Crowe desperately tries to keep his family together.  He depicts a dilapidated shantytown or "Hooverville" erected in Central Park to shelter masses of homeless people.  Crowe's dockworker friend Mike Wilson, played by Paddy Considine, trying to save rent for his wife and child, winds up in Hooverville.  He accidently gets killed while there and is buried in a pauper's mass grave in a disturbing scene.<br /><br />Meanwhile Braddock gets his license to box revoked by smarmy boxing promoter Jimmy Johnston played nicely by Bruce McGill due to a lackluster performance on account of a broken hand.  Braddock has his $50 purse withheld and is so desperate he goes on relief to help support his family.  Eventually as a result of a herculean effort by his manager Joe Gould played by an underappreciated Paul Giamatti, Braddock gets a shot at an important fight as a last second fill in.<br /><br />He miraculously wins the fight as a heavy underdog.  This victory propels him on a series of successful fights, which are effectively filmed with harsh realism, eventually leading to a title shot with current champ Max Baer.  Baer wonderfully portrayed by Craig Bierko, was a man in possession of superb boxing skills but questionable motivation quite the opposite of Braddock.  In spite of his carousing ways and clowning antics in the ring, he was a devastating puncher who had killed two men in the ring.<br /><br />Zellweger, in a fine acting performance, is an emotional wreck, terrorized by the thought of Crowe fighting the deadly Baer fearing for his safety.  She finally relents and gives Crowe her blessing.  The stark realism of the brutality of the boxing business is revealed with some outstanding cinematography in the title match between Baer and Braddock.  The fairytale "Rocky" like ending had the theatre applauding at the conclusion of the film.  The final shot from above the ring which faded to black and white was a particularly excellent bit of film making.<br /><br />The entire cast including director Howard will undoubtedly be considered for Oscars.  Paul Giamatti, snubbed for his role in "Sideways" might very well find a gold statuette in his mitts for his role as manager Gould possibly in competition with Craig Bierko  as Baer.</p></body></html>

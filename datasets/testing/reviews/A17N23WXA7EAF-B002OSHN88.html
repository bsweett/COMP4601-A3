<meta name="summary" content="Top 10 Reasons Why I love this Movie"></head><body><p>1. Graham Greene is a brilliant story teller and "The Third Man" is a fascinating, beautifully crafted tale that lends itself perfectly to the screen<br /><br />2. Few actors living or dead can be considered a phenomenon and Orson Wells is certainly one of them. He brings genius and energy to the screen even though his character is absent for most of this film.<br /><br />3. It must have been a director's dream to be able to film in bombed out, ruined post-war Vienna. It was eerie and fascinating to see this drama played out among the ruins that were quite literally a shadow of the catastrophic war that had preceded it.<br /><br />4. The music in this film is amazing and I haven't encountered anything like it in any other.<br /><br />5. I happen to love film-noire (except for Bush's speeches) and "The Third Man" is subtle, exquisitely refined film noire.<br /><br />6. I am also interested in transpersonal psychology, so I always love it when stories mingle personal drama with larger than life events which this one did.<br /><br />7. From a purely cinematic point of view (I'm no expert, this is just my opinion), this film is beautifully shot with not a single superfluous or disconnected scene.<br /><br />8. The film contains wonderful ironies including the historical fact that post-war Vienna's International Zone was occupied by joint, British, French, Russian, and American troops (literally one of each in a jeep driving along the ruined streets) who could only communicate with each other in German--the language of their defeated enemy.<br /><br />9. The characters are not cookie-cutter good guy, bad guy ,police man, and girl. They are flawed and interesting in their own ways which makes them much more believable and fun to watch.<br /><br />10. I just saw "Until Sunrise" a few weeks ago, so it's fun to do mental comparisons between bombed-out, post-war Vienna, and the hip, cool Vienna of the 90's.</p></body></html>

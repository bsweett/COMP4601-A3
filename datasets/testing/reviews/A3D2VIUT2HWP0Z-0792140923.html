He just follows his nose, and things happen. Maybe if more people did this, they might enjoy what they have in life, and get more out of the precious moments we have in life.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this film is superbly entertaining. If you have a good script, and a Great cast, then all you need is a Zemeckis to create visually good material, and masterful special  effects  to back it all up.<br /><br />The end result is that a very moving, dramatic, funny, and ultimately emotional film will result.<br /><br />if you find something deep and meaningful in this film, then good for you, and if you find something else in this film, I would question why you would watch a film; at its heart, this film is superbly crafted. It cannot but be with the people who created this work.<br /><br />The imposed meanings that some reviewers assert tell more about the reviewers than they do about the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended as great entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Overwrougth Melodrama"></head><body><p>This movie is Edward Norton's movie and Norton's movie alone. The script is hackneyed melodrama. The rest of the cast is there to service a role. Fairuza Balk is cool in a freaky goth chick sort of a way. Edward Furlong doesn't speak much. Even the soundtrack is one of those grating bits of fluff that wants to tell you whenever an important part is coming. <p>The plot is very silly. Nazi skinhead goes to jail. Gets reformed. Comes out feeling very silly. His reform happens when he spends his time talking about basketball with his only friend in the laundry room.<p>Yet - I can't completely hate this movie for one reason alone - Edward Norton is one of those actors that is entirely watchable. He can play very nice or very scary and you never know where he's going to go with it. In this movie he's white kid urban rage on all barrels. He's alternately sinister and scary as he explains the tenets of Nazism and makes them sound almost reasonable. Unlike Russel Crowe who has all the intensity but only rage in &lt;b>Romper Stomper&lt;/b> you can see Norton thinking and planning. <p>Sadly he's trapped in a bad plot and that takes away much of the power. It's trying too hard to be powerful. It fails. If you want to see a serious movie about nazi skinheads watch &lt;b>The Believer&lt;/b>, but if you want to watch an Edward Norton movie, watch this one.</p></body></html>

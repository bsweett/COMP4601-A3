<meta name="summary" content="Impossible not to like!  Hanks is brilliant."></head><body><p>Forrest Gump is a tale of America's culture from the 50s through almost the present day, and it is brilliantly done.  Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is quite simply flawless as an idiot savant who comes into contact with most of the significant events and people of his day. I have always liked Hanks as an actor, and here he puts in an unusual and yes, a brilliant performance.<br /><br />But the real star of the movie is America of the 50s through the early 80s.  The portion of the film that dealt with the Vietnam conflict was unforgettable, as we see large numbers of ordinary American boys swept into a conflict that they little understood.  Gary Sinise puts in a very creditable performance as Lt. Dan, Forrest's platoon leader in Vietnam for whom the war is a personal tragedy.<br /><br />The film hilariously shows Forrest Gump navigate through many of the key events in history during the periods.  He meets Elvis and influences his style.  He meets President Kennedy. He has a ringside seat in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. He is caught up in the Vietnam War.  He meets President Nixon and inadvertantly triggers the Watergate scandal (this part is really a hoot).  The film's portrayal of the hippies and radicals of the 60s is particularly funny and in fact rings true.<br /><br />This is a film that almost everyone will like, and which will touch even the most hard-boiled viewer.  The DVD is a terrific value, and most viewers will enjoy watching this one many times.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shyamalan's Elaborate Bedtime Story Plods Along Under the Weight of Dashed Expectations"></head><body><p>The tightrope that filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan walks with this audacious 2006 fantasy is a precarious one at best, and I was hopeful that his risky undertaking would yield dividends despite his recent track record. While there are some compelling elements, the film is ultimately done in by its contrived execution and lugubrious pacing. Much of the basic problem comes down to the insistent way that Shyamalan applies the brooding atmosphere of his previous films to what is essentially a whimsical fable about maintaining community and believing in one's own potential. These are worthy themes to pursue but not in the convoluted quagmire of faux-spirituality that he presents here.<br /><br />Based on an elaborate bedtime story concocted by Shyamalan, the plot centers around Cleveland Heep, a pensive, stuttering apartment superintendent who obviously has more on the ball than his job would indicate. After hearing splashing in the complex pool over several nights, he discovers a sea nymph named Story, who comes from the Blue World. The rest of the movie focuses on how Cleveland learns the detail of the myth behind Story (apparently a Chinese-based fairy tale) and enlists various apartment dwellers to help him find her way home. At the same time, Story inspires a tortured writer to find his way toward greatness as grass-tufted wild creatures lie in wake to do her harm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Shyamalan chose to populate the apartment building with stock characters meant to represent a societal microcosm, hiring and then wasting several fine actors to play them including Jeffrey Wright as a crossword puzzle expert, Bill Irwin as an agoraphobic bookworm, and Bob Balaban as a cynical film critic. Easily the most self-indulgent move comes from the filmmaker casting himself as the writer. Rising above it all, however, is Paul Giamatti who leverages his well-grounded, self-deprecating humanism to give Cleveland more gravitas than the screenplay warrants. In the impossible role of Story, Bryce Dallas Howard has the right opaque look and plaintive manner, but she is given little latitude beyond that.<br /><br />Production values are top-notch, especially the otherworldly cinematography by Wong Kar-wai's favorite cameraman, Christopher Doyle. It appears all this talent has been directed toward a film that tries fervently to be uplifting but ends up inert. Given the coincidence of Howard's appearance, one cannot help but look back fondly on her father's satisfying film, "Splash", which took a similar premise but added warmth and laughs. The 2006 DVD has plenty of extras though surprisingly no commentary track from Shyamalan. Instead, there is a multi-part, 34-minute making-of feature, "Reflections of Lady in the Water", as well as a brief short, "Lady in the Water: A Bedtime Story" in which the director discusses his children's book tie-in. Less worthy are a few deleted scenes, a useless gag reel and a rather odd audition tape of various actors retching.</p></body></html>

I'm not sure if this is a representation of the continuing wave of independent films with big name stars, such as last year's Lost In Translation, but it certainly was worth watching.  It's one of those films that has a natural ambience.<p>The film does not follow the mundane plotlines as most Romantic comedies.  Of course, in the beginning just when you think it's going to be one of those boy meets girl, boy loses girl scenarios, Charlie Kaufman, Eternal Sunshine's screenwriter pulls a curve ball.  The relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) appear complicated, and indeed it is.  But somehow Kaufman ties it all together in the end.  This film is about identity and memory, and coming to terms with the past in order to tie loose ends that exist in the present.<p>The most uncanny aspect of the film is the appearance of opening credits 15-20 minutes into the movie!  The film almost has a 'Magical Mystery Tour' feel -- the beginning starts off predictable, then suddenly half-way through the film you're hit with a warp sense of Joel's memory and experiences, and then the concluding scenes lends itself to an additional plotline somewhat relevant to the relationship between Joel and Clementine, which involves LacUna, the company that erases both Joel and Clementine's memories.  Unfortunately, it is the weak portion of the film.  <p>The cinematography was effective in portraying the fast paced parts of the film as well as the overexposed photography -- it gave that indie feel as well as the surreal-like effects.  In addition, I found the soundtrack of the film to be quite interesting.  At times I thought one of the opening chords or sound effects came from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, or maybe fragments of The Beatles' A Day In A Life.  I was disappointed that ELO's Mr. Blue Sky wasn't present in the film, but then again it only appeared in the film's trailer.<p>Nevertheless, I recommend this film to anyone interested in catching a movie that's fresh and unpredictable.</p></body></html>

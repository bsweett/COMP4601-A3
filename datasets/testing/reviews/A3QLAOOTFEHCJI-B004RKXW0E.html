<meta name="summary" content="A fitting ending to a beautiful 15 year journey"></head><body><p>Pixar which raised the bar for animation in 1995 with the original "Toy Story", closes the chapter (I think) with this even better 3rd film.  Andy, now 17 and headed to college, must decide what to do with all his toys.  Through human error, most end up on the curb, rescued and sent to day care.  Unfortunately, they are placed with toddlers who are not "age appropriate" playmates for our guys.  Woody, who had been chosen to go with Andy to college, must make numerous moral choices beginning with rescuing his friends.  The Pixar team as you might expect deliver a technological achievement, but pack the film with action, thrills and humor as well.  Expect to swallow hard and whisk away a tear or two as Andy says his final goodbyes to Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang...and to us as well I guess.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A landmark film now on your DVD!!"></head><body><p>Why is Rear Window so important? FIRST, because it sums up all the elements that made Hitchcock a master among directors. It presents his vision of what Cinema was all about. It has a flawless screenplay with, director, stars and technicians at their peak form. SECOND, because Rear Window is one perfect example of the production triumphs the studio-system industrial line of work could generate . THIRD, because it is not just a classical work: it shows the evolution from the classical period in film history towards modern cinema. FOURTH, because it is one perfect example of mastering a technique.<p>I will not bother with the story (which by now, I guess everybody already knows it - a man on a wheelchair watching his neighbors from his window... the crime... etc.) because the story is just one small aspect of what makes this film great. In fact, what it is important to point out is that this story (which is very simple) was translated into a screenplay structurally perfect. This perfection gives depth to the characters, amplifies relationships and oppositions (the stuff drama is made of) and makes the viewer an active part of the spectacle. The viewer works his way through the film and sees things we do not see very often on today's commercial cinema.<p>Plus it is now on DVD. Restored. The image is beautiful and the sound is fine dolby mono 2.0 (although I was expecting a stereo soundtrack when I heard the DVD restoration was coming). The extras are fine (could be improved). Anyway, when the work is that great, who complains about small things? An absolute gem that demands multiple viewings and endless analysis. <p>My favorite line: Thelma Ritter's &quot;When General Motors has to go to the bathroom 10 times a day, the whole country's ready to let go.&quot;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Remake To Make You Feel Young Again"></head><body><p>Many of you are my age.  Therefore, many of you grew up with the<br />original &quot;Oceans 11&quot; flick.  Back then, the film starred Frank Sinatra<br />(as Danny Ocean), Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, Angie<br />Dickinson, Cesar Romero, Richard Conte, Joey Bishop and a cameo role<br />by...yes...Red Skelton.  If you want to see your teenage son (and his<br />girlfriend), give you that neck-twist look like a dog listening to music<br />for the first time, tell them about Frankie, Dino and Sammy and they'll<br />look at you like you're a Senior Citizen.  Guess what?  We are!<p>The face lift (no pun intended) of &quot;Oceans 11&quot; is well done.  The<br />casting is superb.  George Clooney is the new Frankie (Danny Ocean), and<br />Julia Roberts is the former Angie Dickinson.  Support that with Brad<br />Pitt, Andy Garcia (excellent performance), Corey Affleck, Matt Damon,<br />Elliott Gould (hairy chest and all)...you've got a winner.  But the real<br />hidden gem is a performance by Carl Reiner.  I won't tell you more.  <p>I was thoroughly entertained and reminisced of the days when the legends<br />in the first flick were alive and on top of the movie and music charts.<br />That was, believe or not, a movie released FORTY ONE YEARS AGO!!!  I was<br />11 years old.  But don't feel old...go see the new version and regain<br />your youth.  It's a five-spot worth spending!<p>PAUL</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Superman For My Generation"></head><body><p>I was born in 1976, so I spent most of my developmental years in the wonderful 80's.  Although I was still a bit young when "Superman-The Movie" hit the big screen, I caught up with him through VHS and television.  Plenty have donned the red cape, from George Reeves to Dean Cain and everyone in between.  Brandon Routh, who I have yet to see in the latest film, is the current hero of the day.  Christopher Reeve was, is, and always will be Superman to me.  I don't care how hokey the special effects look in this particular flick or how bad the third and fourth films were, Reeve is the Man of Steel in my opinion.<br /><br />This film gives us the origination story of Kal-El, son of Jor-El, of the planet known as Krypton.  If you've been around for a few years, you probably know the rest of the story, so I'll skip that and just stick with the performances of the actors and actresses.  I've gloated on Reeve enough, but I have to admit that his bungling, country-tinged Clark Kent is perfect.  He does a complete 180 degree turn when he rips open his business suit and that "S" bursts onto the scene.  Lois Lane is done with sassy flair by the great Margot Kidder.  She, much like Reeve, has become her character in my mind.  Gene Hackman hams it up as Superman's arch enemy, Lex Luthor.  His over-the-top performance is fun to watch on the screen.  Ned Beatty portrays the bumbling sidekick, Otis, and Valerie Perrine is a scene stealer as the luscious Eve.  Marlon Brando is sufficient as Kent's father, but his performance comes across as rather wooden.  Terence Stamp (General Zod), Jack O'Halloran (Non), and Maria Schell (Vond-Ah) have sinister small roles in this feature, but set the stage well for "Superman II."  The rest of the cast, primarily reduced to supporting roles, do a wonderful job with what they have to work with.<br /><br />As stated before, the special effects are pretty hokey by today's standards, but they were top-notch in 1978.  They help move the story along at a decent pace without hindering the performers on the screen.<br /><br />This film set a high standard for future comic book-based films.  While many have met, and in some cases surpassed, this standard, "Superman" will always be considered the first of the great modern comic flicks.<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of comic flicks, or anyone who just wants to relive the excitement of seeing ol' Superman fly for the first time!</p></body></html>

And I'm Not Referring To Jessica Alba."></head><body><p>Frank Miller's graphic comic-books come to breathtaking life in Robert Rodriguez's dazzling and extraordinarily violent film. "Sin City" centers around 3 engaging stories. The first involves Marv (brilliantly played by an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a messed up, ill-faced tough-guy on a quest to bring his lover's killer to justice. The other deals with the slick, Dwight (Clive Owen), an imposing, trench-coated charmer who unwittingly sets off a chain of unfortunate events by defending his smart-mouthed, physically abused girl-friend (Brittany Murphy). The final entry involves the tormented Willis and his love for a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) who he once rescued as a young girl from a heinous kidnapper and has to do so again when the monstrous villain returns with vengeance on his mind.<br /><br />This film looks splendid. The sets, costume design, cinematography and art direction are top-notch and I don't understand how this motion picture was not nominated for any "Oscars". The film is so visually breathtaking that the images and characters depicted will stay in your mind long after the closing credits. The entire film is shot in awesome black and white and every once and a while a dash of color is added enhancing the visual impact. There really isn't an action movie in recent memory that was this visually stimulating and artistically creative. Rodriguez successfully captures the essence of the comic-book characters without making them appear one-dimensional (It should be noted that Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller are also given directing credits).<br /><br />"Sin City" the comic books are not child's play so it's useless to expect the same from the film. The characters are all violent, impulsive and amoral individuals who kill without an ounce of remorse. The violence is graphic but the grisly gore scenes are executed so brilliantly that there really isn't that many moments in this film where the squeamish will be turning away or covering their eyes. They'll be too busy admiring the awesome beauty of the cast, the eye-catching visuals and the skill-fully choreographed fight scenes.<br /><br />Spectacle aside, the star-studded cast also deserves mention because they all give exceptional performances. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke are the stand-outs. Both actors are compelling to watch especially Rourke who commands our attention and makes the most out of his vicious but sympathetic character. And a review cannot be complete without mentioning the luminous Alba. That platinum hair, gorgeous figure and other-worldly presence makes a delightful Nancy Callahan. Other's in the impressive cast include Powers Booth, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen and Elijah Wood.<br /><br />"Sin City" is a work of art. The luscious visuals, Miller's colorful characters, the film's bleak, desperate setting and Rodriguez's/Miller's/Tarantino's masterful direction all contribute into making this one of the best feature films of 2005. Set aside 2-plus hours and go along on this joy-ride. Chances are in your favor that you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

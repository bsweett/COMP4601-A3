I finally saw it for the first time when I was about 20, and even though I was in college earning a degree in journalism, and this is a movie partly about the journalism of the early 20th century, it really did not live up to the build-up. I viewed it again around the age of 40, and appreciated it a bit more. Finally, I watched it  again last week, and totally enjoyed it...the writing, acting, directing, odd style of story-telling, crazy camera angles, and all. When I was in college, a popular book was "Citizen Hearst", a biography of William Randolph Hearst, who Orson Welles was satirizing with his Kane character. Kane and Hearst share many traits in common, but the movie is not a thinly disguised biography of the Rupert Murdoch of his era. It is a work of fiction, a study of a man whose personality was shaped when he was a heart-broken boy, and whose inherited wealth led him to glory, power, even more wealth, and finally ruin. As is mentioned in the film, "Charles Foster Kane wanted to be loved" but he didn't know how to get it except through purchase or pandering. Don't worry if it does not knock your socks off the first time you see it. It is the kind of film that a person who has lived long enough to have a few big failures, and a success or two, will appreciate more.</p></body></html>

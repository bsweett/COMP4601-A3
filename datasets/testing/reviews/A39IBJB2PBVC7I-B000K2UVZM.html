<meta name="summary" content="De Palma Doesn't De Do It Again"></head><body><p>Brian De Palma is one of the most frustrating working directors.  Though prolific, he's yet to make a great movie and has many disasters to his name.  His particular specialty is reverse alchemy, De Palma takes movies that might have been great and snatches failure from the jaws of victory.  He came closest to excellence in The Untouchables, but if you remove Sean Connery from that film what you have left is Kevin Costner doing his best to impersonate a petrified oak.  Performances that bad are always the director's fault.  You simply cannot strike the set until you have what you need in the can.  The Black Dahlia is a virtual primer on the inadequacies that have dogged De Palma's career.<br /><br />Instead of a coherent, interesting screenplay with characters worth caring about, what you have is the empty artifice of cinema - period clothing, architecture, cars, and idiomatic speech.  For a while that's all engaging enough to help you overlook the lack of story.  When you do start wondering what's going on, what you discover is a handful of unrelated plotlets tossed into a blender and reassembled.  Police corruption, two friends who boxed, a romantic triangle, the unfortunate aspiring starlet known as The Black Dahlia, K.D. Lang, and a fabulously rich family so absurdly eccentric it's over the top even by Hollywood standards.  Since it's De Palma, naturally there is grotesque, gratuitous violence, but because we never know anything about the perpetrators even that fails to generate a jolt.  What happened to the real life Elizabeth Short is horrifying beyond all reason; only De Palma's tepid detachment could make such extreme cruelty dull.<br /><br />As Detective Lee Blanchard, Aaron Eckhart comes closest to delivering an actual performance.  By contrast, Josh Hartnett, as his partner, is both dreadfully miscast and downright difficult to watch.  Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank - both highly skilled in their craft - seem to be sleepwalking through caricatures rather than playing actual people.  In numerous scenes they are out-acted by what they're wearing.  This appalling waste of talent must be blamed entirely on De Palma.  Only Mia Kirshner saves the day, appearing posthumously in short B&W audition films where she is speaking directly to the camera.  As Elizabeth Short - The Black Dahlia - she is the film's tragic heart.  In better hands, a script, and a movie, could have been built out from this center - then perhaps it would have been about a person, instead of being a dog's breakfast of Hollywood stereotypes and cliches.<br /><br />As a final note.  You simply haven't experienced bad directing until you see Fiona Shaw's swansong, she makes Al Pacino look like Marcel Marceau.  De Palma's ability to find funding time and again does make one wonder if he has extremely incriminating photos in a safe deposit box.  Should have called it The Black Dullia.</p></body></html>

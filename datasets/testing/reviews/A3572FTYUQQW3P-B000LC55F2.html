<meta name="summary" content="A magic show without magic"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this film but came away rather unsatisfied.  It was a show about magicians, magic, competition, and obsession but never seemed to develop any charisma or real emotion. The initial accidental and predictable death never rang true as a motive for all of the death and destruction that followed.  Nevertheless, the film does keep your interest and keeps you guessing.  After all this is a film about deception, lies, and secrets so the plot twists are plausible at least right up until the end which is totally implausible and I think it is this implausibility that caused me to only give three stars.  I cannot fault the actors who did a fine job and Michael Caine is always a pleasure to watch, so I think it was the screen play that was weak, although this weakness only surfaced at the end.  I thought the film was worth seeing and it was entertaining, but unlike many of the other reviewers here I didn't think it was "one of the best movies of the year".  It certainly wasn't the quality of "The Departed" which is indeed one of the best movies of the year and academy quality.  "The Prestige" is entertaining but not a great film.</p></body></html>

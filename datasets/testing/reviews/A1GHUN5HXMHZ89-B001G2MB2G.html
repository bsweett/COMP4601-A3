Although I love the charm and innocence of the first couple movies, I respect the maturing and depth shown in the last two. In this movie we get to see good fight evil in a match up that is leading to the final great confrontation. It is quite clear sides are being formed based on loyalties to good or evil magic. The armies may not be large, but they are formidable. The introduction of a new creature was a nice touch, but the main theme is friendship. These undead looking horses with bat like wings that can only be seen by those that have witnessed death are friendly and play a key part in helping Harry. It is Harry's friendships that have now bonded those ties to fight Lord Valdemort and his allies. Initially we see that Ron and Hermione are still very much in Harry's corner.<br /><br />Harry isn't just preparing to fight Valdemort, he is fighting his own demons that make him wonder why the commonality of his life and that of Valdemort. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel when several school members join him to train in magic to fight Valdemort. Unfortunately they must hide in order to practice since the professor of the Defense Against the Dark Arts has taken over Hogwarts and forbidden the use of defensive magic. That's right I said the defense against the dark arts. There's irony for you. She is truly the worst person to have on your side if you are trying to prepare an Army to fight the dark lord. Fortunately Neville finds them a place to practice to get out of eyeshot of the puritanical pompous peacock in pink called Dalores Umbridge. I think she was the worst kind of muggle in sheeps clothing. She obviously doesn't believe the dark lord has returned, nor that they need to use magic. Does that sound like a professor you could learn from at Hogwarts? NOT!<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie on a number of levels. I think they have done a great job with how Harry has grown not only in age, but in attitude. The central theme of friendship is remarkably comparable how students feel when preparing to graduate high school. The same type of struggles they face when dealing with how to choose whether to lead a life of good or evil. I recommend it whether you have read the book or not. I think if you have read the book you will need to be tolerant of the parts that have not been included. I must admit I wish the movie had been a little longer and included a few parts pointed out by some of those that read the book. All-in-all still a great movie.</p></body></html>

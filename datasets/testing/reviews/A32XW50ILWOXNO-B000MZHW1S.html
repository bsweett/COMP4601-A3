Bang, done that."></head><body><p>Africa is the issue du jour in Hollywood these days, and director Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" is the latest attempt to shed light on the continent's genocidal civil wars.<br /><br />Along with the brutal, borderline-racist "Black Hawk Down," the film is the goriest on a list that includes "Hotel Rwanda," "Sometimes In April," "Lord of War," "The Interpreter," "The Constant Gardener" and "Catch A Fire." Zwick's production certainly is the longest; it's hard to get tired of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, two fierce actors in excellent performances, but "Blood Diamond" drives you right to the brink of tedium.<br /><br />Charles Leavitt's plot-heavy screenplay zeroes in on Sierra Leone's 1999 civil war with little political detail. What we're shown is an overwhelmed puppet government against the rebels of R.U.F sadists who listen to Ice-T and Tupac as they shoot villagers from flatbed Toyotas and kidnap boys to become part of their war machine.<br /><br />Fisherman Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is one such villager separated from his family and sent to a diamond pit to panhandle for gems, which are used by the rebels to pay gunrunners for weapons. He finds a 100-carat pink doozy and hides it in the red dirt.<br /><br />Diamond smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio, with a semi-consistent accent) hears of Solomon's diamond and makes a play to become his partner in relocating and selling the diamond to legitimate outfits in London, which launder the dirty diamonds, have them cut in India, then sell them, just like any other diamond, in the open market.<br /><br />Archer, a self-described "soldier of fortune," is weary of this arrangement and willing to sell his story to an American political journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) after he snatches the gem.<br /><br />At its core, "Blood Diamond" is really an "Adventure In The Bush!" as Danny, Maddy and Solomon run, hide, con, bribe and kill their way back to the location of the diamond. There are three significant action sequences, all well done, all convincingly played by the actors. Archer in particular is no saint - he can crack a joke one breath, crack a skull the next - and DiCaprio gives the role the right kind of suave menace. He's a rough dude, ruthless to the last. We just happen to be rooting for him.<br /><br />Solomon, of course, is a near-saint as the poor, humble African looking for his family - the written character is a walking cliche - but Hounsou doesn't let the performance wander into self-pity. Screenwriter Leavitt at least addresses Solomon's servitude posture to Archer in a fight sequence that, again, is a clich&#65533; but at least dissolves the gnawing sense that Hounsou is sidekick to DiCaprio's Lone Smuggler.<br /><br />Zwick may not be a household name, but since he directed "Glory" in 1989, he's made a pile of cash - he produced "Shakespeare In Love" and the television show "thirtysomething" - and used it for costly, epic shoots. He took two years and $140 million to make Tom Cruise's bloated "The Last Samurai."<br /><br />Unlike the Cruise vehicle, which at least worked as a documentary-style look at the Japanese samurai culture, "Blood Diamond" is late to the topical party. Conflict diamonds may be the focus, but the exploitation and genocide of Africa is still the subject, and Zwick is more intrigued by African sunrises, rocket explosions and how many cigarettes DiCaprio can smoke. It entrenches itself in the ground level of the conflict, useful for sympathetic purposes but not so much for edification.<br /><br />Are the conflicts of Africa about capitalist greed and men looking for their families? Yes. But it has to be about more than that.<br /><br />I have yet to see "The Last King of Scotland," but that story, about the rise and fall of Ugandan leader Idi Amin, and the exhaustive, powerful retelling of the Rwandan civil war found in "Sometimes In April," seem the more essential stories now. Seek them out. Save "Blood Diamond" for a DiCaprio Saturday swoon-a-thon.</p></body></html>

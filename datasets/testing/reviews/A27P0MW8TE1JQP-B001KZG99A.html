<meta name="summary" content="IRONMAN is finally a MADE MAN!!!"></head><body><p>Robert Downey Jr. may not seem to fit the superhero archetype, but he is the quintessential TONY STARK! Downey is egotistical, edgy; both smug and smooth, comic book fans will quickly associate him with the flawed, sometimes less than heroic head of STARK Industries and IRONMAN himself. This isn't the only good bit of casting Gwyneth Paltrow is sooo perfect as the Moneypennyish Ms. (Pepper) Potts, Stark's personal assistant and unrequited love interest. Terrence Howard as Tony's right-hand-man Col. Rhodes (and War Machine in the future-sequel) is great as is Jeff Bridges as Stark Industries co-CEO and more (as the ominous poster would indicate).<br /><br />The 1963 Marvel comic, holds up well in the 21st century, the billionaire weapon-making industrialist, has a change of heart (sort of literally) after discovering his weapons aren't always used on just the bad guys. He reinvents himself (also, sort of literally) and returns home to more altruistic designs, but discovers he may have been betrayed.<br /><br />State-of-the-art FX contains some of the ultimate transforming sequences in which Tony Stark suiting-up never gets old (infinitely better than the NFL graphics). Equally cool are the aerial combat sequences with old Iron-head zipping `round pilots. The chrome-dome-computer-generated finale maybe one of the most clich&eacute;d moments, but even this is forgivable, next to so many other stand-out moments in which the film shines (including the perfect proclamation of Tony Stark in the films final moments! Starks ego is appropriately served!)<br /><br />Actor/ director Jon Favreau, who cameos amusingly enough, as Stark's driver, may have been a risky pick for such a huge property, especially without a notable hit-list. But, Favreau must be a fan or at least understands what comic fans want, as well as grasping the needs action/popcorn fare. Props to you Mr. Favreau, this AIN'T NO HULK! I can't wait for the sequel, with more drinking for Tony (no rehab research needed for Downey there) and more flying for Rhodes.  Why not the Avengers, too?<br /><br />Yes co-creator Stan Lee shows up, this time with an entourage!<br />Stay `till after the credits roll or you'll be furious....FURIOUS!!!</p></body></html>

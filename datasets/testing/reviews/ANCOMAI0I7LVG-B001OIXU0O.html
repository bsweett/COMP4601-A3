<meta name="summary" content="Mamma mia, this was awkward..."></head><body><p>This poorly made, highly obnoxious and often annoying musical is so over-the-top with deliciously tacky charm that it almost demands you enjoy it.  The scary thing is that, for the most part, I did.  I remember turning to my wife after the film had ended and muttering the words "that was awkward" and maybe that is part of the charm.  No one seems entirely comfortable with their role in this film, and that layer of discomfort kind of adds a tinge of adorableness to the film and its vast array of characters.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that this is a good movie, just a fun one.<br /><br />The story is of young Sophie who lives on this crazy island with her single mother who runs a hotel on the verge of a breakdown.  When Sophie decides to get married she wants to have her father walk her down the isle (what young girl doesn't).  There is just one problem; she doesn't know who he is.  After reading her mother's diary she discovers that there are three possibilities; Sam, Bill or Harry.  She decides to invite all of them to her wedding in order to discover who her father really is, but when they arrive she realizes that finding him is going to be harder than she thought.<br /><br />The film is ridiculous and just a hodgepodge of overzealous musical numbers that are so focused on zany choreography that they forget the most important aspect of a musical number is the singing.<br /><br />Despite this, I cannot say I was not entertained.<br /><br />The best acting award goes to Streep (is that really a surprise).  She is so over-the-top yet thoroughly committed so that even when she's all over the place it is in a good way.  She is clearly having a blast filming this and it shows all over her face.  Surprisingly, young Amanda Seyfried actually holds her own and delivers a nicely tuned performance.  It doesn't hurt that out of the entire cast they are the only two who can sing (Streep has a few pitch problems but she actually soars on her final number).  Christine Baranski is funny, as is Walters.  Colin Firth is, well, Colin Firth (you gotta love this guy) and Stellan Skarsgard (who I've been a fan of for some time) delivers one of the more sympathetic `fatherly' performances.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan is a revelation here, and not in a good way.  His voice is GOD-AWFUL (he sounds like a dying walrus, or a drowning man with Down syndrome; take your pick).  I'm really surprised they allowed him to sing his own songs (I'm really surprised they didn't recast the whole film to be honest beings that the two female leads are the only ones who somewhat make it through this film with dignity).<br /><br />His Razzie was certainly owed him.<br /><br />Don't expect a good film (I hope you aren't), but do expect to have a good time.  I can see why this is so loved, for it is lovable.  It is very poorly made (even the dancing numbers seem choppy and sloppy), but Streep does wonders for the film to be honest.  Her ability to just throw caution to the wind and embrace the campy mess that she has been dealt simply draws in the audience and lets them know that it's okay to turn off your brain and have a good time.<br /><br />Even Meryl Streep knows that this movie is horrible.</p></body></html>

First, as a horror movie THE SHINING is a classic in the same league as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN,  and ROSEMARY'S BABY. Then, I look at how it stacks up as a Stanley Kubrick movie. In this regard, it's also a classic, with it's isolated / desolated atmosphere, and cold, vast set-pieces. Next, I judge THE SHINING against other Jack Nicholson films, and yep, his Jack Torrence role is up there with his take on the Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN and his version of Satan in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK. This is malevolent, crazy Jack at his best! Lastly, I ask myself how good THE SHINING is as a Stephen King movie. Well, it's right along-side of CARRIE and THE DEAD ZONE as far as I'm concerned. I loved King's novel and have read it many times. I just see the book and the movie as two completely separate entities that can be enjoyed on their own merits. So, I give THE SHINING it's due as a chilling masterpiece...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How to revive a zombie franchise"></head><body><p>I really liked the first Resident Evil movie.  It managed to find its own voice in a venerable first-person shooter horror franchise with Mila Jovovich. She brought a cool sensibility to a Alice, who by all rights should only be eye candy.  The film's script was respectful without slavishly adhering to the original series, which rarely made much sense anyway.<br /><br />The second Resident Evil movie was a mess of whip cuts, blurry action sequences, character stereotypes, and a paper thin plot. All is forgiven with Resident Evil: Extinction.<br /><br />Extinction picks up right where Resident Evil: Apocalypse left off. The zombie plague continues to spread, the Umbrella Corporation still plots in its burrowed-out secret lairs, and Alice is still an out-of-control killing machine. Extinction starts out just like the first installment, with Alice in a red dress wandering a plastic-wrapped mansion, and for a moment her confusion is palpable - I thought we had recorded the wrong film at first. But then it becomes clear that a diabolic experiment is taking place with Alice at its center.  In that regard the movie plays like a Resident Evil greatest hits: There's the creepy little girl! There's the rabid skinless dogs! There's the laser mesh death trap!<br /><br />But now that the infection has spread to the world, Resident Evil shifts gears to another popular horror staple: the zombie apocalypse.  All this testing takes place in a military facility surrounded by zombies, reminiscent of Day of the Dead.  Alternating between Umbrella's fiendish plans is the survival of most of the characters from the first film. Making up for the absence of Jill and her miniskirt is Claire (Ali Larter of Heroes fame), who leads the ragtag band of survivors that struggle day to day with issues of food, fuel, and morale. And then there's Alice, the supersoldier with trust issues.<br /><br />Alice, Umbrella, and the survivors all eventually collide in a winner-takes-all battle for survival. This film is not afraid to kill off beloved characters and it gives them a suitable sendoff. The final monster battle is mitigated by the concluding scene, in which Alice promises revenge against Wesker and all of Umbrella. It's a memorable shot that's worthy of the Resident Evil franchise.<br /><br />There's a whiff of devil-may-care in what was supposed to be the final installment of the Resident Evil series. It destroys the established Resident Evil universe, taking it in a completely different direction from the game.  And that's how you revive a franchise.</p></body></html>

Its a weird type of movie where nothing really makes sense yet you know exactly what is going to happen less than halfway thru. Nothing is really a surprise here. I don't even know what genre to categorize this film into. Its not a horror nor was it really suspenseful. Its just sort of an annoying and unnecessary film, lacking in charisma and a real plot.</p></body></html>

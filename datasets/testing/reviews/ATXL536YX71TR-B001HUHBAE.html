<meta name="summary" content="3 hours!...NEVER LOST MY ATTENTION......."></head><body><p>Any time a three hour film holds my attention,somebody did something right!!!ZODIAC never lets up.It is so chock-full of info and police leads and dead ends that the viewer is actually actively examing ALL of the evidence attempting to make an arrest! NOW THAT IS INTERESTING.What's great about this "whodunnit" thriller is.....WE DON'T KNOW.You could watch this film several times still trying to piece together the profile and actions of the Zodiac killer, and may come out with a different solution each time.It is so good to see the enigmatic Robert Downey,Jr.,again, so brilliantly portraying journalist Paul Avery.This really is a well researched and complex film delivered with much integrity.</p></body></html>

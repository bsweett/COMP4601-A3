According to the Queen, the royal family should show reserve. It is a private matter. Not to mention the issue involving Diana's children. They should not be exposed to the media and the circus which surrounds the situation. No emotion should be shown. A sort of stiff upper lip mentality. That is after all, what Americans think of when we think of the British, isn't it?<br /><br /> There is a scene fairly early in the picture when Queen Elizabeth II break down and sheds tears. The camera never shows us her face. The Queen would never express such feelings in public, it simply would not be decent, so the camera man and director Stephen Frears give her, her space.<br /><br /> It is because of moments such as this that make "The Queen" seem a bit too real. It is a docudrama but somehow it feels like a documentary, we know it's not, but the movie, especially screenwriter Peter Morgan, seem to know too much. How did they acquire this information? This is what I became most impressed with as I watched "The Queen".<br /><br /> If you haven't heard "The Queen" tells the story of how the royal family treated the public outcry concerning Princess Diana's death and the relationship between the Queen and the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whom many felt correctly judge the public's "mood" in how to handle the tragic accident.<br /><br /> Much praise has been thrown Helen Mirren's way for her performance in the film, and she is quite good. Despite playing a real person Mirren doesn't give us an impersonation. She adds something more to the role, truly trying to flesh out the character (I say character because essentially that is what it is. This is a work of fiction despite everything). Some might say Mirren isn't doing much, there is too much restraint. They have a point, but, that's the way the character is presented to us. It is how this character would behave. Therefore it cannot be considered a fault. Instead it is an asset. A tribute to Mirren's performance.<br /><br /> But Mirren isn't the only performance worth watching or talking about. The entire cast, from Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, to James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles. Each actor makes us believe they are the characters they are playing. Cromwell, while a bit more emotion (usually expressing anger) gives the some kind of subtle performance as Mirren. Each character required the same approach.<br /><br /> But is there more than meets the eye to Frears' film? Maybe. Would it be out of line to suggest "The Queen" is really about Britain's class system? Blair, who won an election based on the assumption he would offer change and fight for the middle-class is constantly at odds with the Queen, as she represents the "establishment", the exact people Blair was voted in to take on. But Blair serves as buffer. His character is designed to show us both sides. Without one side, the country would be lost. Gone would be it's history and tradition and without the other, gone would be optimism. The two need each other.<br /><br /> Frears for his part he does a great job balancing all of this and gives the film just the right pace. "The Queen" never overstays her welcome. While not one of my favorite directors, he has nonetheless directed many entertaining films, which also take on class systems ("Dirty Pretty Things", "The Grifters") but here I think he has outdone himself. This is one of his very best works!<br /><br /> Bottom-line: A docudrama that presents itself as a documentary. At times we wonder, how do the filmmakers know this stuff? All of the performances are pitch perfect, with no one stepping over anyone else's toes. High recommended film!</p></body></html>

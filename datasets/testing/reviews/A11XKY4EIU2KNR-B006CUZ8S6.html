<meta name="summary" content="Good flick"></head><body><p>I have never had any interest to read a Harry Potter book, but for some reason I really enjoy the movies. I guess because they are different and have something new to offer other than the usual Hollywood "Blow everything up and show off my heaving pecs" movie.<br /><br />I really liked the witch soccer game, the ghost in the bathroom, the scenery and sets. I liked the giant snake at the end and the way Harry killed it. How the elf got his freedom at the end of the movie was pretty funny.<br /><br />I was a little confused with the whole "I am a memory and my diary holds my rememberances and I need this sacrifice to become real again", but I went along with it. I don't take movies like this so seriously that I cannot enjoy them.</p></body></html>

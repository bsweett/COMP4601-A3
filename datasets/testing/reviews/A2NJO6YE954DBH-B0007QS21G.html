<meta name="summary" content="Stupid science plus stupid characters equals stupid movie"></head><body><p>I am eminently capable of enjoying movies with stupid science and/or stupid characters, but there has to be some sort of redeeming quality.  For example, even the pie plate flying saucer in "Plan 9 From Outer Space" sounds good compared to the idea of thinking yourself into the past in "Somewhere in Time," but that film had Christopher Reeve making the grand romance work.  The problem with "The Day After Tomorrow" is that the best part of the movie comes in the first act, and that is not where you want it to be.<br /><br />The stupid science here is to take the idea of global warming leading to a radical shift in climate that creates a new ice age and instead of it happening over centuries or years reduce in to days and weeks.  No wonder scientists were rending their garments over this film, because even though I never took even biology in high school I know that what is being played fast and loose with in this film goes way beyond hearing explosions in the vacuum of space.  However, the whole point of this stupid science is to allow director Roland Emmerich, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeffrey Nachmanoff, yet another opportunity to destroy New York City, having taken major bites out of the Big Apple in both "Independence Day" and "Godzilla."  But Emmerich is more ambitious this time around, having tornadoes play havoc with the landmarks in Los Angeles before putting NYC in a deep freeze.<br /><br />In the grand cinematic tradition that goes back beyond Watergate to the science fiction films of the 1950s, a brilliant scientist, climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), gets to sound like Cassandra while Vice President Cheney, er Becker (Kenneth Welsh), worries about the fragile economy rather than the fast approaching end of the world as we know it.  Hall gathers data and yells that the sky is falling but nobody really pays attention until giant hall comes raining down from the sky, giant tidal waves flood the Eastern seaboard, and a trio of what would be called hurricanes if they were not situated over the three northern continents instead of tropical waters re-program the planet's climate.<br /><br />The nice thing about identifying the point in this 2004 summer flick where it crosses the line is that Quaid's character actually draws it on a map of the United States.  A trio of killer storms are going to be raging for days over the northern part of the planet.  The temperature is dropping to below -150 degrees, the point at which fuel freezes, where people freeze to death on the spot.  Hall draws a line across the middle of the country and tells the President (Perry King) to order the evacuation of everybody south of the line to Mexico and forget the rest because basically they are dead already.  At that point the voice of sanity and reason in the film announces he is going to go to New York City to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam, the girl (Emmy Rossum) he likes, the rest of the members of the school smart person squad, and assorted citizens of New York are trapped in the New York Public Library which is flooded by freezing water and contains a copy of the Gutenberg Bible.  Sam is smart enough to figure out how to call his father, who tells him to wait there and he will come to get him.<br /><br />On the one hand kids should always call their parents when they are going to be late coming home, especially when a natural disaster beyond imagination is responsible for the delay.  But if our heroic scientist wants the President and everybody else to write off every human being living above his line of demarcation (my guess is that Canada and Scandinavia are no longer contenders for Olympic gold in hockey), he should practice what he preaches.  Otherwise, he becomes a stupid character.  Beyond that, while I like the idea that a Ph.D. can stop you and people who travel with you from freezing to death when everybody else is dying in their steps, I am pretty sure we are back to stupid science (I bet the Ph.D. has to be in a scientifically related area, which means rhetorical studies does not count).  I live in a place where it is winter six months of the year (our first snow is expected tomorrow night), so I know the value of dressing warmly.  But there are repeated scenes of people dressed warmly freezing to death in this movie so unless Hall is carrying the One Ring or has some other magic talisman that can temporarily dispel the coming of a new ice age, he and the other stupid characters stupid enough to insist on going with him on his stupid mission and all going to die stupidly (unless, of course, the screenwriters just stupidly ignore their own premises and continue with their story unabated by reason).<br /><br />Basically "The Day After Tomorrow" is a disaster film more in the tradition of "The Poseidon Adventure" (bad thing happens at the start and people try to survive) versus "The Towering Inferno" (bad thing happens at the end and people try to survive).  Part of the problem is that there are several extended scenes of mass destruction early in the film and then things get relatively boring with ice forming and ice breaking being the key developments.  The other part of the problem is that nobody in the film is as interesting as Shelley Winters.  My favorite character in the film ends up being Jeremy (Tom Rooney), who has decided that if he is to die his final act is going to be to save one very special book from being burned in the effort to stay warm.  Nothing else in the film has the intelligence or the nobility of that moment.</p></body></html>

Clint Eastwood plays in a supporting role as her coach Frankie Dunn with Morgan Freeman acting as the narrator and gym manager, "Scrap Iron" Dupris.<br /><br />Maggie comes to Dunn's gym hoping he'll take her on as a manager. She's got some serious strikes against her:  she's a girl, while she's trained extensively she's not done it properly, and she's 32 years old.<br /><br />"Scrap Iron" (Freeman) takes the girl in and gives her some pointers despite Dunn's objections.  Maggie begins to learn and box right.  Her determination and guts impresses Eastwood enough to take her on as a student.<br /><br />The tale isn't just about what it takes to be a boxing champion, but how to make your dreams--any of them--come true.  This is a hard film to watch and one that will leave you crying in the end.  But, it's not one of those films that you'll forget anytime soon.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Haven't seen the original..."></head><body><p>I didn't see the original with Edward Herrmann, so I have no basis for comparison. What I did notice throughout was a direct rip-off of Nicholas Roeg's '73 "Don't Look Now", with an equally disappointing end for our hero. The sad thing is that where Roeg used style and focus, this film seems wrought with silly masks and over-acted hysteria. I didn't hate it as much as the others did, but I'm definitely going to seek out the original. Yes, the acting was pretty bad and unbelievable, though I liked Diane Delano (a Kathy Bates look-alike), and Leelee Sobieski's fine talents were badly wasted. This remake also reminded me a lot of Shyamalan's "The Village", though, again, it lacked style. Director Neil Labute is a talented man, but this one is best forgotten.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It Hooked Me"></head><body><p>There are some problems with seeing a movie for the first time a few months after it's release.  You read reviews and the side articles, and an image appears in your mind as to what you are about to see even before you see it.  You read how much of the movie is fiction.  You read (and read and read) articles about how Russell Crowe is such a jerk.  And then you actually see the movie.  <p>With all the above baggage, there is added about halfway through the film a turn that throws you for a loop.  Not exactly the same way as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;The Others&quot;, but the same in the sense that you are jolted into rethinking what you have been shown.  Unlike those other two movies, where the shockers are at the end, and it explains everything, in this movie, it appears in the middle.  You now have the rest of the movie to decide if you've been cheated.  Without revealing anything, I'll say, like the other two movies, all the clues are there if you've paid attention. <p>So I liked it for that, and I liked it for the performances.  I didn't like Russell Crowe in &quot;Gladiator&quot; because he was too much of a superman.  But in this one you get to see a performance of a character who probably thinks he is the smartest person in the world, and therefore somehow evolutionarily above just about everyone else.  To see some humbleness being introduced when this crumbles is done very well.  When he regains his prestige, however, he descends into another kind of hell, and it's not so much the descent as the recovery that is heartwarming.  Once again, he finds he has to interact with other humans to truly find happiness.<p>There is also a great supporting cast, especially Jennifer Connelly.  During the first part of the movie, there is nothing special there, but as Crowe's illness reaches dangerous levels, how she takes over is work that deserves the Oscar she got.  Considering she has to interact with someone who most of the time would prefer not to interact with anyone, how she finally gets into his world helps make the movie a joy to watch.</p></body></html>

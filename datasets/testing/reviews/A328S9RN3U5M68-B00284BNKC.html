<meta name="summary" content="The penultimate examination of drug addiction"></head><body><p>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is disturbing, strange, emotionally riveting, and ultimately devasting.  All of those adjectives would seem like a redlight to NOT view this film, but the brilliance of this creation by Darren Aronofsky after Hubert Selby, Jr.'s book does what few films do - it makes a gut-wrenching learning experience.  From the hardcore heroin addiction to the even more terrifying addiction to doctor-prescribed "medication" drugs we are shown the gamut of how cruel this disease of addiction is to the victi's body, to loved ones, to the world.  The performances by each of the cast members are superb - Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans - and the supporting cast (especially the elderly friends of Burstyn's 'Sara')is very strong. But is is the directorial decision to use split screen techniques, rapid motion repetions of popping pills or preparing to shoot up and the middle-of-the-target musical score tha makes this film alomost unbearably real.  A terrifying movie that should be recommended viewing for everyone to get a take on the drug problem this country faces.</p></body></html>

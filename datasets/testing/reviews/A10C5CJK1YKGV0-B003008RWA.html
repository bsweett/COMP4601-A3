<meta name="summary" content="Just try not to get in sick in America ..."></head><body><p>You would have to be a pretty hard heart-hearted person and stubborn to boot, if you couldn't watch Michael Moore's documentary `Sicko' and not be a concerned, troubled or a little worried.<br /><br />It's interesting to say the least, that of the few documentaries that Moore has done, this one has taken the least amount of flack, but also getting the smallest amount of press. I guess the message is in the movie, and you should come away with it if any of your humanity is still intact when it's all said and done. I'm sure the health-care industry can't wait for this film to just `go away' and drift quietly into the background and dusty used DVD bins.<br /><br />What can be said though of all the folks being dumped in downtown Los Angeles? Some might say: "Well, Moore didn't show that it probably happens in other countries and it's not the hospitals problem to house them."<br /><br />Living in Los Angeles, I can tell you, that the `patient-dumping' issue has been widely reported over the media for the last few years and has been looked at as incredibly embarrassing and absolutely the wrong solution for indigent patients. So if other Americans know that it's wrong, then it doesn't really matter who else is doing it as it should be obvious that `patient-dumping' probably happens in a lot of places, not just the United States. But maybe it doesn't? Maybe as well as a better health-care alternative, they also take care of their homeless as well? I can safely say that Social Workers `do' take care of the indigent patients before they leave the hospital and make sure they're not going to "heal up" on the streets with freshly bandaged wounds.<br /><br />But as a Veteran, I guess the worst part was the fact that 9-11 Rescue Workers have been so sorely neglected and allowed to fall through the cracks as Moore clearly evinced, and which was something that was without protestation. Doesn't that bother every other person who watched this film? I'm absolutely sure that it did. The fact that they went and received more exhaustive and complete care from a country that is 1) off-limits 2) lower on the list of `countries with the best health-care' than the US and 3) a country with very little to no resources, is a condemning statement on a completely intolerable situation.<br /><br />But, we will tolerate won't we? No one will rise up and protest and say that it's wrong, will they? Everybody's too busy with their low-riders, vacationing on a yacht, getting to work for their midnight shift, too wrapped up in their own lives to worry about `all these other people' who need health-care and a better system of long-term care.<br /><br />I read a few of the negative reviews on this film as well, out of curiosity, just to see what people were saying. The bulk of these people could seemingly benefit from some remedial education as they obviously have problems articulating complete sentences, shaping basic grammar and punctuation and a lack of an ability to crystallize their own ideas. It's a shame that we live in a country where people who aren't even mediocre at best, can seemingly try to shout down, detract, spew garbage and complete bombast while not even having a grasp of the concepts that they're trying to flag-wave about, let alone tear down.<br /><br />Maybe some intelligence first, might be a sound idea, before trying to blast others with a wet rag.</p></body></html>

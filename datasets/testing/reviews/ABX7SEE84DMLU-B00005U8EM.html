<meta name="summary" content="Never Anything Quite Like It"></head><body><p>No one invented quite such an original premise as is depicted in this movie.<br /><br />And it works great as a chaser after seeing "I Heart Huckabees."  It's every bit as existential, and frames a proposition for personal growth out of a nightmarish stagnation as compared to the complete freedom of time enjoyed by the "Huckabees" folks.<br /><br />No matter where you go, there you are.  Each film says that it is up to us to make something better.  This film says that once you get to a place of generosity, other-centeredness and relentless good will, you can be redeemed - if only to figure out anew what to do with all the time we've been given.</p></body></html>

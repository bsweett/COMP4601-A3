<meta name="summary" content="Excellent and Thoughtful film"></head><body><p>This is an exceptional film that offers a very realistic view of the mental character of Adolph Hitler in the final 10 days of World War II. There were three basic plot lines that the writers and director developed; the collapse of the city of Berlin, the mental breakdown and suicide of Adolph Hitler, and the poisoning of the Goebbels children by their mother Magda.<br /><br />It is the invasion, destruction and collapse of Berlin that remains the constant background to all of the action in the bunker. We see step by step the advancement of the Russians, the despair of the Berlin citizens, and the vigilante groups killing suspected collaborators and deserters. I found the German generals, soldiers, physicians, to be portraits of ordinary and brave humans who are contrasted against the insanity of Hitler. Hitler's belief system would never allow him to take responsibilities for any of his mistakes or actions, but to always project paranoia and blame outward. He repeatedly made decisions that cost thousands of civilian and military lives because he saw the people and military of Germany had betrayed him by losing the war and must now be wiped out. As Hitler's empire crumbles he congratulates himself for at least almost exterminating the Jews of Western Europe.<br /><br />Magda Goebbels thought that the world would not be a fit place to live if National Socialism was extinquished and thus she kills her beautiful children in the bunker. This part of the movie is so creepy that it almost detracts from the fantastic battles in the streets of Berlin and the outrageous outbursts of temper from Hitler to his staff and generals. Magda Goebbels competes for craziness with Hitler in the film - which may be the films one flaw.<br /><br />Albert Speer is played superbly by an actor that strongly resembles Speer. Speer's last scene with Hitler is so telling as Speer admits to Hitler that he has not been destroying Germany's industrial and transportation infrastructure as Hitler ordered because he knew the German people would need such a system to emerge from the rubble. Hitler would have killed Speer if he had known this. Speer offers his hand to Hitler, but Hitler refuses to shake it or look at Speer again.<br /><br />The story is presented through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, who was present during the entire last 10 days in the bunker. Thankfully she survived and was able to tell the details of all the final pathology in Hitler's last days. This film is a classic already.</p></body></html>

It's back to the lone Predator and yes we all just about know his tricks, but this one is nonetheless still charged with that tension of a hunt in session. It also includes really bizarre twists to the hybrid universe of Aliens and Predators that you just have to see. I couldn't help to secretly cheer for the Predator who is more grounded by Rules of the Hunt. Unlike the Aliens who are strickly killing machines and the humans who seem to just try and gain your sympathy. This movie isn't stale by any means. I'm not some old stickler who demands too much and is pathetically attatched to what the Predator and Aliens use to be. I'm all in for change. Why make the same dull substance with such a changing audience? For me that would be so cowardly that I would be more upset about not giving it a try even if what they made was less than savory. The Extended Edition indulges in worthy things. Like getting to see how the Predator truely gears up for the most serious of Hunts. You see a better Intro and it all fits together making the ending seem more of a body of work complete. Excellent movie and the only reason it lacks the Highest standard, the fifth star rating, is because I compare it to all movies of both series. It certainly doesn't have the marvelous cinematography of Alien one, and it doesn't have a human character that I care about like Arnold in Predator.</p></body></html>

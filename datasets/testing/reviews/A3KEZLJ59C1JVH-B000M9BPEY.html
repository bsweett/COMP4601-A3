<meta name="summary" content="Why didn't this movie get an Oscar nomination?!"></head><body><p>What an amazing movie!  William Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a man who is coming to terms with the impending death of his father Ed (Albert Finney).  Will has issues with his father because he is tired of listening to Ed's fabricated stories about his life.  We are treated to many of those stories in a delightful series of flashbacks featuring Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom.  The retelling of these stories leads Will to do some investigating, and he is finally able to understand what kind of a man his father really is.<p>The performances in this film are fabulous.  Ewan McGregor is hysterical, and his resemblance to Finney is kind of eerie (as is Alison Lohman's resemblance to Jessica Lange).  Helena Bonham Carter also delivers an outstanding performance in her dual role.  Tim Burton does an amazing job creating the magical world of Edward's imagination: the visual effects are astonishing, and the whole film has Burton's creepy &quot;edge&quot; to it.  <p>&quot;Big Fish&quot; is an amazing movie that is comical as well as sentimental.  I will never understand why it wasn't given an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.</p></body></html>

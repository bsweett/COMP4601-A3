<meta name="summary" content="Wedding Crashers"></head><body><p>John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn) are wedding crashers.  At the beginning of "wedding season", they map out plans to hit all the big weddings.  They go the the weddings, pretending to be distant relatives of the bride or groom, and soon are partying away at the reception.  Of course the ultimate goal is to hook up with a woman, and they do.  Over and over again.<br /><br />After the season is over, they are presented with a bonus round.  The oldest daughter of William Cleary (Walken), Secretary of the Treasury is getting married.  They are successful, and soon John finds himself falling for the bride's sister Claire (McAdams).  On the down side, Jeremy finds himself stalked by the other sister, Gloria (Fisher).  When the secretary takes a liking to the boys, he invites them to a private party for the weekend.  John is excited, Jeremy is not, and soon both meet Claire's fiancee Sack (Cooper).<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is a funny movie.  Wilson and Vaughn have the buddy vibe going, and their interactions all seem genuine.  They both have their moments to shine, but Vince Vaughn really cranks it up a notch as he tries to avoid Gloria and the gay brother.  This movie is similar in tone to the "American Pie" movies as well as comedies from the 1980's.  It is a good end of the summer diversion, and will not disappoint fans of the genre.  I recommend.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Despite Flaws This Is One Good Scary Flick"></head><body><p>Shelley Duvall is just plain weird, and Stanley Kubrick morphed Stephen King's bestselling novel into something almost unrecognizable, yet THE SHINING stands the test of time and continues to scare generation after generation of wide-eyed viewers because the one-card-shy-of-a-full-deck Jack Torrance is so aptly and believably played by a demonically grinning Jack Nicholson.  No other part has been so tailor-made for Creepy Jack, who fits into the lead role like wiggling fingers into a well-worn glove.<br /><br />Kubrick supplies the heady visuals:  a luxury mountain resort, about to be abandoned for the long winter, with its whispers of the past, labyrinth of hallways, and dark shadows.  Duvall and Nicholson supply the tension:  a struggling writer about to go off the deep end with his wife and small son living as caretakers at the resort, while the wife watches helplessly as her spouse unravels.  The hotel plays its part helping Jack Torrance descend into maniacal madness, giving Nicholson the vehicle he needs to grin and grimace and scream and shout as he terrorizes his family with flesh-crawling creepiness.<br /><br />Sure, there are plenty of flaws; the film becomes silly and disjointed as it rushes towards its climax, some of the visual gimmicks (gallons of what looks like cranberry sauce spilling out of the elevators) are lame, and Duvall was definitely a weak link, but it doesn't take away from THE SHINING's ability to terrify.  I don't know what it's like firsthand to watch a man become violently evil, but Jack Nicholson in this movie gives me a pretty good idea.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

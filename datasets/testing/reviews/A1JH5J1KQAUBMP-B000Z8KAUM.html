While Rueben recovers from a heart attack, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and company (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, ad nauseum) implement a far-fetched and ill-defined plan to sink the big opening.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first movie and found something to appreciate in the second, as well, but this third installment is just awful from beginning to end.  They use the drill that dug the Chunnel to burrow under the casino so they can simulate an earthquake?  Really?  Are you kidding me?  And nobody notices?  By the way, when the first one breaks down, they manage to come up with a second one.  This is only one element of a plan that would require unlimited resources and the omnipotence of the Almighty himself to pull off.  I think it was just made as an excuse for Clooney and his cool posse to pal around in Vegas for a few months.  What a life!</p></body></html>

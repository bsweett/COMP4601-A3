The film takes place on a plane, hence the title and she meets a seemingly nice man played by Cillian Murphy. Lisa (McAdams) is terrified of fying but that fear suddenly evaporates when her fellow passenger threatens to kill her father, don't want to give too much away but Red Eye which is directed by Wes Craven will have you creeped out right 'til the very end. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

I must say that when I heard Joaquin Pheonix was going to play Johnny Cash I was skepticle. But then I saw a preview and thought, "You know except for being tall enough he has the mannerisms down and I think he can pull this off." I hate Reese Witherspoon in most of her films so that kind of was bad for me too. But I decided to go see it and I was blown away. First both did their own singing and did a good job. I think it might have been top notch if they would have used John and Junes real voices but you can't complain on the out come of them doing their own. The story is also excellent and heartwarming. It has funny moments and also very sad moments. It also shows the downside of showbiz and drug addiction. But it also is inspriring in the story of June and John's love. Also Robert Patrick was excellent as Johnny's father Ray Cash and it really showed Patrick as a very good actor. The story of John and his fathers tension and then finally them declaring a truce and almost reconciling later in life was also heartwarming.<br /><br />This is a very good movie. Even if you are not a Johnny Cash or country music fan you should watch it. Its just good filmaking.</p></body></html>

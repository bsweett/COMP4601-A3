<meta name="summary" content="Justice always comes from the underground"></head><body><p>Thieves robbing thugs robbing crooks robbing etc. A first robbery and then a member of this first  team robs his team and then the victims of this fink recuperate their gold from him in a spectacular third robbery. From Venice to Los Angeles, from gondolas to cars, from canals to overstuffed streets, etc. The interest is not so much in the action which is simple and well dynamized by a good rhythm. Not so much in the plot and the suspense because we all know from the very start that justice will prevail, I mean that the first robbers will recuperate their gold no matter what. The interest of the film is in the details of the action. It all revolves around the use of hightechnology in city managing (here the traffic and the subway) and in security systems (here safes and the tools to break them without explosives). But once again this does not create any suspense because we know this hightechnology will not fail, except on order and command. The second interest is in the characters. They are simple and their psychologies are also very simple, but less simple than we could have feared. Hence they have some simple depth nearly like real human beings. A father who is absent, a father figure who is looming high and a man who comes into the slot and becomes the absent father who is no father any more but just a plain and desired male lover. This needs two rather good actors to imply and impersonate this situation in simple face expression and body language. The camera does the rest. In other words a good entertaining experience. By the way the fink looks like a fink from the very start : the way he walks, the way he smiles without smiling, etc. But why on earth was he given a slightly mexican or at least latin american look ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

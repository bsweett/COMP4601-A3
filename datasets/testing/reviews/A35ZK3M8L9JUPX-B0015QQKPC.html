<meta name="summary" content="Apollo 13 (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"></head><body><p>It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon, but as far as the American public was concerned, Apollo 13 was just another routine space flight, until these words pierced the immense void of space, Houston, we have a problem. Stranded 205,000 miles from Earth in a crippled spacecraft, astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert fight a desperate battle to survive. Meanwhile, at Mission Control, astronaut Ken Mattingly, flight director Gene Kranz and a heroic ground crew race against time, and the odds to bring them home. One of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic movie despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. "Apollo 13" is an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining movie, but is also a educational one.</p></body></html>

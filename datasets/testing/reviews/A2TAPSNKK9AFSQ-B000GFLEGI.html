<meta name="summary" content="Astute Social  Commentary? Nah, Just A Lousy Zombie Movie!!!"></head><body><p>In this movie we once again have a horde  of Zombies who have developed "intelligence" or something akin to this.This was George A. Romero's first mistake. I don't know about you but when I go to see a zombie movie I expect them to be brain dead and eating living human flesh. Even "Shaun Of The Dead "  realized this. So now you have "smart zombies' who organize an uprising against the Upper Classes. I seem to recall  reading about something like that in one of my Sociology Classes at College. It seems that Romero wanted to make a movie which included "Social Satire And Commentary" but all he has done is put too much plot in the way of a (potentially) good Horror movie.Watching this movie made me wonder if Romero has been reading too much Karl Marx? Just a thought. As the man once said 'If you want to make entertainment spend 20 million bucks. If you want to send a "Message" go to Western Union". I give this movie 5 stars because somehow Mr. Romero has managed to live off his reputation alone for the past 30 years.</p></body></html>

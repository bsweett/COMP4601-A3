<meta name="summary" content="A waste of time with few laughs"></head><body><p>The critics did not like this film but the trailer looked goods so I rented it and it was bad the trailer shoed all the good stuff. The movie is a big fluff with a story that really gose now here and when it's done you think what happend what twas the point. The film is very boring with a few laughs and has ok acting Shirley McLain is the only good part of the whole movie as she steals every scene she is in. I found Aniston whiney and COstner boring. The directing si bad. It's like the film tried to hard to be good but it failed. There are some funny moments but only some not enough to recomand this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE MAFIAS' GREATEST TRIO!!!"></head><body><p>man, goodfellas is one of the best, and stays real on the mafias way of life. no beating around the bush, gives it to you strait. the whole story, the drugs, the profanity, the beatings, the betrayel. beautifully done. scorsese out did himself on this one. he's a great director and this was just a masterpiece. brilliant putting robert de niro, ray liotta, and joe pesci together. they were terrific. they just bring that mafia vibe, to the table. robet de niro is the man in just about every movie he does. it shows you the all the good: money, sex, drugs, and the power, along with all the bad: betrayel, crime, addiction, and death. you can't trust nobody, and you can't let this stuff get to your head. if you can't stay true your finished. it feels so good when you're on top, but when you fall there's no turning back, you get what's coming to you. great movie, perfect as it is, and wonderful potrayel of this underworld.</p></body></html>

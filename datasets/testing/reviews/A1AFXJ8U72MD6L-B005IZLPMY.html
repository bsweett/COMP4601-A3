Chris Evans does a commendable job of playing the humble, heroic lad who will be turned into Captain America. Stanley Tucci gets one of the best speeches even though his time in the picture is limited. Hayley Atwell is one of the better love interests of the various Marvel movies. Hugo Weaving is under used. The reference to MI6 was in correct as they were known as the SIS during WWII. Small nitpicking there, I admit.<br /><br />There's a good deal of pulpy action and overall the story is good even if not great nor superlative. This film cost $140M to make and yielded a tad over $365M at the box office. A sequel is expected but THE AVENGERS (which will appear many of the Marvel Heroes) is going to be released beforehand. Critics were generally positive about this film. This picture was nominated for a number of awards and the 2011 Scream Awards gave it Best Superhero. As usual watch the credits to see a sneak peek at a future Avengers film.<br /><br />WHEN WATCHED: October 2011; STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; IDEALS: B; ACTION SCENES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.<br /><br />BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan: Are you sure you know what you're doing? Steve Rogers: Yeah. I punched out Adolf Hitler 200 times. ///[flipping through Steve's file] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Where are you from Mr. Rogers?  Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities. Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file. Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it's not the exams I'm interested in. It's the five tries. But you didn't answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis? Steve Rogers: Is this a test? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes. Steve Rogers: I don't wanna kill anyone. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from. Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? /// [to Steve] Dr. Abraham Erskine: So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi's invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the...my people struggled. They...they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the...and the... [he waves his hand] Dr. Abraham Erskine: And he...he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, you...he says you will us strong. Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of Hydra, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he's ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for a cult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power in the earth, left there by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist. [flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine's formula and injects himself with it] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man. Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength. And knows compassion. Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.</p></body></html>

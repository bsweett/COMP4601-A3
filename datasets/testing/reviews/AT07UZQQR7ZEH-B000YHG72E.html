<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful Christmas movie"></head><body><p>For a lot of moviegoers, Bob Clark's delightful A CHRISTMAS STORY (1983) is their sleeper favorite Christmas movie each year.  Mine, after believing in Santa again after two superb versions of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (George Seaton and John Hughes), is bound to become director Jon Favreau's hilarious and inspired ELF (2003).  Here is the premise in David Berenbaum's very original screenplay:  a baby who crawls into Santa's toy bag ends up being raised at the North Pole by Papa Elf (a wonderful Bob Newhart).  At age 30, elf Buddy (a wonderful Will Farrell) is a real elf sent to find his human father (James Caan) in a Christmas New York City filled with fake elves and phony Santas in myriad toy departments.  Caan is much too busy with ad accounts in his Empire State Building office, so Buddy finds himself in the Toy Department at Gimbels.  There is a very funny scene where a huge boss of the department tells him to get back to work and stop saying "This is not the North Pole-where's the snow?"  Watch Buddy jump for joy when told by the boss that Santa is coming at 10:00 a.m. the next morning.<br /><br />Buddy falls in love with an incandescently delightful Zooey Deschanel, as a hardworking Gimbels elf.  Working all night to make the Toy Department look like the real North Pole, Buddy wanders into the empty women's locker room at dawn when he hears Zooey taking a shower and sweetly singing "Baby, It's Cold Outside."  Deschanel has a lovely singing voice and, like Farrell, should have gotten an Oscar nomination.  In another movie era, ELF would make her a star.  She slowly realizes that Buddy is the real thing; so do Caan's wife, Mary Steenburgen, and whoever plays his young son.  Buddy does outlandish things, like eating spaghetti with maple syrup and drinking a whole two liter bottle of Pepsi in one gulp, then letting loose with a 20 second belch that had me on the floor laughing, despite my better judgment.  It is FUNNY.<br /><br />ELF is sublime whenever Zooey is on screen with Buddy.  With Sinatra's "You Make Me Feel So Young" on the soundtrack, the two discover the Christmas wonders of Manhattan, including Rockefeller Center and the largest tree Buddy has ever seen.  And they share a lovely first kiss while ice skating.  Poor Caan keeps losing ad accounts with unbelievers, but slowly warms to his elf son because everything Buddy does has good intentions, like cutting down a gigantic Christmas tree in Central Park to have a tree at home.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, Santa (a well-cast Ed Asner) brings his presents and sleigh to Central Park, but finds himself grounded there because his sleigh is powered by believers, who are in short supply!  But eventually even Caan becomes a believer when he passes up a huge ad account to be with his neglected real young son, Buddy's brother.  Zooey shows up to do a heartfelt rendition of "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", eventually joined in by a huge gathering of believers.  Obviously, the movie has a happy ending.  I won't tell you what it is.  I have already given away ? of the plot.<br /><br />ELF reminded me a bit of John Hughes' expert remake of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (1994), where Richard Attenborough is so convincing as Santa and enchanting young Mara Wilson is such a true believer that the whole movie works beautifully to make even jaded adults rethink their previous training about Santa really being your parents.  When Buddy hears this story from Papa Elf at the North Pole, he scoffs hilariously, "Oh yeah, right.  I'm sure the parents have time to work and still get all the presents and make the cookies for Santa's visit!"  If you can find enough magic in your heart to try and believe in a real Santa Claus and genuine North Pole Elves, the wonderful duo of Will Farrell and Zooey Deschanel in ELF will sure go a long way toward making a believer out of you.  Even if you don't believe, you should still laugh a lot and have a good time.<br /><br />ELF is a movie that seems destined to be a Christmas season movie perennial.  John Debney did the lovely ethereal music score, which is interspersed with traditional carols, and Rusty Smith is credited production designer for the fun job of transforming Gimbels Toy Department into the North Pole.  Now who are director Jon Favreau and writer David Berenbaum?  I look forward to what they both do next.  The movie is both Full Screen and 1.85 Wide Screen on DVD.  It is also an Infini Film that you can play with a trivia footnotes commentary over the movie, if you like.  There is also a traditional commentary with Favreau and Farrell, but I opted for the straight movie to hear all of the dialogue.  Have fun with ELF.</p></body></html>

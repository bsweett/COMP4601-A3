<meta name="summary" content="A Charming and Delightful Story of Christmas in 1940"></head><body><p>For some reason unknown we had never seen this movie before last night. Well last night we watched it and were totally drawn into its charm. In 1940 I was about the same age as the hero of our story and shared the same longings for a Red Ryder BB Gun. It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance that BB gun had in the life of a boy of that age at that time in history.<br /><br />The movie does a grand job of picturing the life of a boy in that era; the radio programs, the special rings, decoders and other secret devices that were available for the boy who wanted to be a part of something special and most of all the prized BB gun. These things made life worth living for the boy of that time. The serious turn that life would take on December 7th of the next year was still future and unknown; life at this time was good.<br /><br />In the evenings the family would gather around the radio and listen to favorite shows; there were a number of mystery shows that would come on in the evenings and we would always turn off all of the lights in the house and the glow of the dial on the Philco radio would be the only light. Some of the feelings of this mood are caught in the movie.<br /><br />The movie faithfully captures pictures of products that were popular during that time in the kitchen and laundry. The major children's movies of the time, "Snow White" and "The Wizard of Oz" are portrayed in the Christmas parade scene. Both of these movies were major accomplishments that still have a huge following today.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of placing the viewer in the mind of the young boy in 1940 with his dreams and fantasies about what might be awaiting him in life. This movie is a fairly authentic trip down memory lane for those of us who lived our lives at that time and a glimpse of life from a boy's perspective in 1940 for those who were to be born later.<br /><br />I recommend the movie highly for the entire family; we're adding it to our annual Christmas collection along with other Christmas classics.<br /><br />PS For the record I got my Red Ryder BB gun but can't remember for sure if I slept with it.</p></body></html>

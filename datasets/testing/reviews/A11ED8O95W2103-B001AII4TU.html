<meta name="summary" content="Yes, it's as bad as you've read and heard."></head><body><p>But even a "bad" Shrek movie is more fun than most movies.<br /><br />That said, why didn't it work like the first two?<br /><br />1.  Uncompelling story that missed a huge opportunity for new satire.  Rather than rehash Prince Charming and have him storm the city of Far Far Away and then have Shrek's people storm it again (I think that castle's been stormed three times in two movies!), how about making the movie a spoof of the whole King Arthur mythology?  That would have been fun.  And what's funny and sad is that when I watched the storyboarded "deleted scenes" in the special features, they were more funny than most of the stuff in the movie!!<br /><br />2.  Too dark and violent for too long.  A lot of the movie just wasn't fun at all.<br /><br />3.  Crass use of popular music sound bytes.  One of the fun things about Shrek movies is the use of popular music tunes, and they were used very effectively in the first two movies.  But why did I have to hear "Live and Let Die" for a frog's funeral?  Or Heart's "Barracuda" when the gals storm the castle?  These loud heavy handed old rock tunes just switch in and out of the movie like someone is back there flipping the "time for the popular" tune switch, no matter if it really helps the story or not.<br /><br />4.  Really really lame DVD menus.  I kept watching the DVD main menu screen waiting for something fun to happen, and it never did!<br /><br />5.  And, you know something went wrong when there's no commentary track on the DVD.  At least I couldn't find one.<br /><br />So, aside from the sheer escapism of Shrek, and a few good gags, like Gingy's life flashback, this was like someone just took leftover Shrek stuff out of the back of the fridge and cooked something up.  Twenty million hours of render time does not a satisfying story make!</p></body></html>

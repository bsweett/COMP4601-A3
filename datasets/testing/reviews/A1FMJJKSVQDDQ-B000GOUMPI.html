<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick + Nicholson + King = Horror Classic"></head><body><p>You've probably seen this movie before. Either that or you've at least heard of it somewhere. Yes, Stanley Kubrick's loose adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" has become one of the most famous horror films of all time. It's been praised by critics including Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin, and has been parodied in music videos and TV shows such as The Simpsons. It may not be loved by Stephen King himself, but I, including millions of others, love it. It's not your typical Hollywood-style horror film, and it doesn't want to be like one. It doesn't have any loud "jump" music or annoying teenagers or underdeveloped villains. This is a very unique film that stands on its own. It's not the blood and gore that make this film very special, but the eerie atmosphere that is present throughout the film. It also delivers some haunting images and iconic performances. Now I do like a few recent horror films such as Saw, Event Horizon, and House of 1,000 Corpses, but The Shining remains as my #1 favorite in this specific genre.<br /><br />Like many other Kubrick films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Full Metal Jacket, critics and audiences have analyzed the entire movie. There have been film critics and college professors who always discuss everything from the opening aerial shot to the photograph right before the end credits. I don't think that's really necessary, because The Shining isn't supposed to be fully analyzed. It's up to us to decide for ourselves what the story is all about. For some, it could be the effects of isolation and how it transforms into insanity. For others, it could be how the spirits that dwell in the Overlook Hotel are messing with these people's minds. For me, I would go for the latter. True, a few scenes seem like they come out of nowhere, and have no relevance to the plot (the man in the bear costume, for example). But the images themselves are so grotesque and so undeniably scary, that you can't help but be amazed by them.<br /><br />But aside from the ambiguous story and some terrifying images, I think the strongest elements in the film are not only the eerie atmosphere, but also Jack Nicholson's performance. Nicholson is without a doubt a fascinating actor; he knows how to play crazy. Here, you can see some fine examples. Nicholson was rightfully cast as the lead character; he knows how to be frightening and intimidating when he slowly becomes psychotic. It's a very effective performance, and one of his greatest in his entire career. The other performers do extraordinarily well themselves. Scatman Crothers is believable as the chef Dick Hallorann, while Danny Lloyd is surprisingly good as Danny. Shelley Duvall, despite all the complications during filming, really pulled it off with her character Wendy. Her fear and desperation look genuine. I don't think anyone else would have done a better job than her.<br /><br />At least 95 percent of the reviewers here have nothing but praise for this movie, and I am part of the majority. I won't say much about The Shining, since it'll probably make this review look like a short story, but I will say that it's one of my favorite films, and my top favorite horror film of all time. Kudos to Kubrick, Nicholson, Duvall, Crothers, etc.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

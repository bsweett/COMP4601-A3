<meta name="summary" content="Troy"></head><body><p>Michael and I watched this on TV from our room in New York City. I tried to explain it to him and to myself. It is from the Iliad written by the Greek poet Homer. Ilium is a word for Troy. Trojan Paris seduced Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Greece. The Greeks sacked Troy, using a wooden horse to enter the city. Brad Pitt is Achilles, the Greek hero who kills Hector. Achilles dies when Paris shoots an arrow into his heel. Michael asked if the part about the horse was true. I said the story is half true and half made up. The Trojan War was fought around 1200 B.C. Homer lived around 800 B.C.</p></body></html>

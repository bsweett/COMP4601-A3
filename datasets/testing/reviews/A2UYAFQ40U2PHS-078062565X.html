<meta name="summary" content="Eerie, terrifying, unsettling, even today...."></head><body><p>I just saw this again on TCM, and the surprising thing about this film is that despite the fact that it's over 70 years old, its power hasn't diminished at all.  Despite 2 remakes and countless parodies (The Simpson is especially fond of parodying this film), it is still a great motion picture.  It is very intense and surprisingly terrifying, especially in the uncut version.  Despite the "advances" in SFX today, these effects don't feel dated, because you're so drawn into the story, and you really care about the characters.  Fay Wray and Carl Denham are real people, not just stock characters reading movie lines (ironically, Denham is a film producer here).  The scenes where Kong battles prehistoric creatures are unnerving and still unsettling even today (in some reissues, these scenes were cut, but have been restored for all subsequent DVD editions).<br /><br />As much as I admire Peter Jackson, I cannot understand why he would want to remake/"reimagine" this film, as it is his favorite film.  He is an excellent filmmaker (the scope of the Lord of the Rings films is amazing, and he should commended for that), but how can you remake something you love?  I don't understand it at all, and especially when the original film has so much force, power, and depth to it.  It's like remaking The Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind.<br /><br />Regardless, the original King Kong is magnificent, one of those movie classics that more than lives up to its reputation.</p></body></html>

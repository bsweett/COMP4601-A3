<meta name="summary" content="Intelligent, unusual thriller"></head><body><p>This is an intelligent and unusual supernatural thriller. Set in pre-Katrina New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta (there is an excellent use of its locations), it stars Kate Hudson as a caregiver who is given the job of nursing the invalid husband (John Hurt, who, playing a recent stroke victim, doesn't speak a word in the whole film) of Gena Rowlands, who live in a creepy old house in an old plantation. Soon it becomes clear that the Hurt character knows something terrible that he is unable to say. This is only the beginning of a very creepy, unsettling thriller. There is a very intelligent final twist, that holds up on second viewing (many viewers, I suspect, will not get the twist on first viewing). I don't remember seeing such twist in a movie before, but in its supernatural implications (in the possibility it holds in someone switching bodies), it is reminiscent of a nifty H. G. Wells story, the Story of the Late Mr. Evelsham.</p></body></html>

"Iron Man 2" lacks the qualities that made the original so engaging. The inimitable Robert Downey Jr. and a stalwart cast are wasted in this overlong, badly paced superhero saga. Jon Favreau's once-sharp direction goes on autopilot - weighed down by Justin Theroux's needlessly cluttered, drawn-out script. Plenty of CGI overkill, yet precious little excitement. The already-planned "Iron Man 3" has nowhere to go but up.</p></body></html>

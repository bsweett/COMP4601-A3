<meta name="summary" content="Better than most say!!!"></head><body><p>Like many, I am a fan of both the "Predator" films & the "Alien" films, with the exception of "Reserection" which of course played like a slasher movie, this one brought back the suspense element so missing in that one, why so many trash it, I don't understand, yes, maybe it should have been longer, but it delivered the goods nonetheless, It definately can be considered a sequel to the "Predator" films & prequel to the "Alien" films, I think I have figured out why so many dislike it, my take from reading many reviews here, are the fact that many see continuity issues as their reasons for disliking it, there are maybe one or two, that I noticed, but that is it, most recent complaints are below that can be clarified such as>>><br /><br />Lance Henrickson playing Charles Weyland, Bishop's creator, this makes sense, seeing that this is the company Ripley from "Alien" worked for, & that Weyland Industries Inc. terraformed the planet Lv426 in "Aliens", & that Bishop is an android of Weyland, as for Henrickson's human appearance in "Alien 3" this could very well have been Weyland's great grandson, it is never said that Weyland didn't have offspring prior to his demise.<br /><br />Many have complained that the Predators only come every 100 years, so therefore it contradicts the "Predator" films, not so, if you pay attention, the Predators come every 100 years for a rite of passage, this however doesn't mean they don't come to hunt for sport as seen in the other films, nowhere are we told the Predators are picky about their hunting climate, the Predators are hunters plain & simple, no matter what climate, hunting the aliens is a rite of passage, hunting humans for sport, there is a difference you know.<br /><br />As for the aliens on earth, well Antarctica is a believable scenario, not exactly a booming town with people you know, & it sort of sets up the "Alien" films, especially when you consider the "Company's obsession with capturing a specimen even at the expense of their own employees, how did they know what it was the Nostronmo crew had, this film helps explain that a bit better, remember Ash in "Alien" was an android created by Weyland's company who protected it.<br /><br />Many have complained about the inpregnation time period being short, if you remember in "Alien" Kane's inpregnation period happened awful fast too, time is never clarified in that one or this one.<br /><br />Many complain about the surviving Predator teaming up with the lone human survivor as being contradictory, not so, if you remember, the Predators at the end of "Predator 2" show a mutual respect for Danny Glover's character as a show of sportsmanship for defeating one of their own, why wouldn't they here for defeating an alien?.<br /><br />Many say a Pyramid in ancient times could not exist in Antacrtica because it froze before humans, how do we know? we can't, & do we really know what lays beneath Antarctica, I think not.<br /><br />& the reason the aliens never make it to society on earth is simply because the Predator nukes them all, & the survivor (Sanaa Lathan) could have easily told Weyland Inc. about her experiences & they would likely keep it quiet, but yet they knew in "Alien" what the Nostronmo crew had, that is why Ash protected it even though it was killing the crew.<br /><br />As for the Queen surviving in the Pyramid, remember, she was frozen, as for there being more aliens than hosts, how do we know many of them were not frozen with her 100 years ago, we don't, there is nothing to suggest otherwise.<br /><br />The only place I see inconsistency that no one seems to notice is the Predator's inpregnation, the Queen throws her tail into him, this does contradict "Alien 3" when an alien refuses to kill Ripley because of her inpregnation, the Queen would not have done this, & like one reviewer noted, the arriving Predators would have inspected their fallen one before allowing it into their ship, this is the only flaw aside from the Predators being so easily defeated by the aliens, other than this, this one stays overall consistent, I just requires you to think a bit.</p></body></html>

I forget who but one of the participants joked that it was "Ray" with white people.  That's a shame because it diminishes what an impressive work this is.  Though I'm not a fan of country music per se Johnny Cash always garnered my respect and kind of had street cred.  You had to admire Cash's uncompromising devotion to his work and how he carried his pain and personal demons with dignity.  The makers of "Walk the Line" were cognizant of the integrity of their subject matter and unlike "Ray" do not try to mimic the artist their portraying.  Instead they try to channel the spirit and essence of Cash and wholeheartedly succeed.  Joaquin Phoenix may not have the physical build or vocal intonations of Cash but he intuitively understood the essence of the man.  It doesn't take much doing to imagine the Man in Black playing out his own life on the screen.  Witherspoon equals Phoenix in her portrayal of the commonsensical June Carter.  Less is known about Carter than Cash but in Witherspoon's portrayal you can imagine how her guardian angel saved Cash from the abyss of substance abuse.  I have no doubt in my mind that time will be kind to "Walk the Line" and be re-evaluated as the truly great film that it is.</p></body></html>

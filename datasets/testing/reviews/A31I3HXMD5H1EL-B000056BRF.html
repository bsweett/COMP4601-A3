<meta name="summary" content="New Edition of Epic Worth Buying Again!"></head><body><p>If you're a film fan, like me, you already own a DVD of the 1959 "Ben-Hur", with additional features, and you may, initially, be reluctant to shell out for the new four-disc set. But this is as close to an 'ultimate' edition as we'll ever see, and the MANY 'extras' it offers makes this THE copy to keep!<br /><br />Among the many exciting bonuses:<br /><br />A newly-restored print, with a 'Music Only' track, allowing you to savor one of Miklos Rozsa's greatest scores...<br /><br />The long-awaited DVD release of MGM's 1925 silent version of "Ben-Hur", with Ramon Novarro in the lead, and beefy Francis X. Bushman as Messala. Arguably the greatest silent film of the 20s (it established MGM as the premier movie studio), it holds its own VERY well against the sound version, with a terrific sea battle and chariot race, two-strip Technicolor in key scenes, and a fabulous 'new' score, composed by Carl Davis. If you've never seen it, you're in for a real treat!<br /><br />PLUS...<br /><br />"Ben-Hur: A Journey Through Pictures", which uses preproduction storyboards and sketches to show the metamorphosis of the film from concept to reality. Peter Jackson's "Rings" trilogy 'Bonus Features' really pioneered this concept, but the new "Ben-Hur" edition has taken it to a whole new level, and it shouldn't be missed...<br /><br />Not one, but TWO documentaries on the making of the epic; the excellent 1994 Christopher Plummer-narrated piece (which was included in the previous "Ben-Hur" release), plus a brand-new documentary, offering insights by modern directors, cinematographers, and other production people on how the film influenced their work; George Lucas (who tends to be a bit dry) acknowledged that the "Ben-Hur" chariot race did influence the pod race in "Star Wars I", and Ridley Scott admitted he watched "Fall of the Roman Empire" and "Ben-Hur" for inspiration, prior to making "Gladiator"...One of the contributors is Charlton Heston's son, Frasier, a gifted filmmaker himself, who offers his own memories of the 'shoot'.<br /><br />A very enjoyable documentary on the life and career of William Wyler, from 1984, full of home movies, 'behind-the-scene' photos and his last interview before his death...<br /><br />AND all the extras from the previous release, including trailers, newsreels, screen tests (Leslie Nielson, so serious, is fascinating!), costume and make-up tests, and other goodies.<br /><br />Finally, commentary by Gene Hatcher, film historian, and scene-specific comments by Charlton Heston, himself...while this 'extra' isn't 'new', Heston's failing health gives his words, recorded for the last "Ben-Hur" edition, a bittersweet quality...When he passes, an era will truly be gone forever...<br /><br />See why THIS is the DVD edition to own?</p></body></html>

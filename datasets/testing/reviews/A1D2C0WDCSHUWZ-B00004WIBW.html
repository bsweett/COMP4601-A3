<meta name="summary" content="The horseman comes, and tonight he comes for you!"></head><body><p>There are only a handful of movies that I consider to be the true Halloween classsics... and "Sleepy Hollow" is one of them. Loosely adapted from Washington Irving's story, this Tim Burton classic is part romance, part detective story, and part gothic horror -- and Johnny Depp helps elevate it to a brilliant supernatural thriller.<br /><br />Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders. He soon learns that the locals believe that a monstrous undead Hessian known as the Headless Horseman is the one who's beheading people. As a rational man of science, Ichabod thinks this is ridiculous... until he has a close encounter with the Horseman after he committed some of his murders.<br /><br />But Ichabod is still convinced that someone living is controlling the Horseman, and it's all wrapped up in a complex scheme involving a pregnancy, a marriage, a will, and a tangled family tree. But as deaths stack up and heads roll, Ichabod and his orphaned servant Masbeth (Marc Pickering) discover that they are up against evil that they couldn't have even imagined.<br /><br />"Sleepy Hollow" is vintage Tim Burton, back when he was a little more restrained about said style -- everything is painted in blacks, whites and greys with brief splashes of color (BLOOD!), eerie gothic buildings, and skeletal trees. And there's that little edge of rickety weirdness, especially when Depp whips out his buggy-eyed binoculars.<br /><br />Now, it's not perfect -- the witch's hentai-tongue/eyeballs always make me burst out laughing. But Burton really infuses this movie with a sense of creeping, bloody horror that gets more and more nightmarish, peppered with moments of bleak humor (Ichabod trying to throttle the Horseman) and some really disturbing beheadings.  It's a pretty sharp contrast to the rather sweet, shy romance between Ichabod and his host's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.<br /><br />As for Depp, he's absolutely perfect -- he plays Ichabod Crane as a young man with a horrifying past (which is revealed via dreams) and an abiding love for logic, science and reason.  He's also pretty nervy, fragile and neurotic; how often do you see movie heroes who faint more often than the heroines?<br /><br />Christina Ricci is rather wooden at first, but she improves a lot as we discover some of the secrets she keeps hidden. Pickering is excellent as a young orphan who latches onto Ichabod as a surrogate father, and Miranda Richardson is all spidery creepiness as Lady Van Tassel. Also keep an eye out for Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon and Christopher Walken's hilariously over-the-top Horseman.<br /><br />"Sleepy Hollow" is all creepy atmosphere and weirdness, but it also has a solid story at its center. Blood, magic and a deranged undead horseman, all done with Tim Burton's gothic style.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Annoying"></head><body><p>Is it too much to ask to have the actual Hulk look like a real living, breathing, being?  This creature was so cartoonish my suspension of disbelief evaporated even faster than a Liv Tyler tear, making the INCREDIBLE HULK a most annoying viewing experience.  Don't get me wrong:  I truly admire comic-based movies that are engaging and well made (case in point, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man</a>); but when the action hero is presented so grotesquely over the top as this version of The Hulk, all bets are off.<br /><br />Which is kind of sad, as I'm a big fan of Ed Norton films (and this is the first one of his movies that I did not enjoy); yet Norton's considerable talent is wasted here, as he's little more than a prop between monster manifestations.  Liv Tyler is a solid thespian as well (and easy on the eye), but she, too, seems to be going through the motions.  William Hurt plays a great villain, and is one of INCREDIBLE HULK's few positives, while all I could do was just laugh at Tim Roth as a deranged soldier turned Hulk Antagonist (and if you think Hulk is over the top, wait 'til you see Roth's Cloverfield-looking get-up).<br /><br />Lastly, Norton's Bruce Banner character always wears elastic-band pants under his everyday clothes so that should he "change" he will at least be modestly attired.  My take is, once he Hulks up into his giant green bling, who the heck is gonna protest he's in the raw?  Like I said about INCREDIBLE HULK. . .annoying.<br />--D.

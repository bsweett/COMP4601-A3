The Apollo 13 mission was ill-fated from the start. One of the crew was grounded,assumed to be ill. Jim Lovell's (Tom Hanks) wife lost her wedding ring. Yet the mission still went on.<br /><br />"Apollo 13" shows the gripping adventure on board the spaceship. It was a life and death struggle. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon skillfully depict the crew's loyalty and squabbling. Their struggle to orbit the Moon- as well as return home alive- captured the world. People united in prayer. It's an inspirational story. Ed Harris is great as the grounded crewmember who famously said,"Failure is not an option!"<br /><br />"Apollo 13" is powerful and inspiring. It launches the soul.</p></body></html>

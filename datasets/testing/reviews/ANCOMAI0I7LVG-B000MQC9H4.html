<meta name="summary" content="A serviceable diversion but far from a `treat'..."></head><body><p>The film, as a whole, works marginally well; enough to validate seeing it and enjoying it but not enough to really constitute adoring it.  As far as romantic comedies go, `The Holiday' gets it half right.<br /><br />The half they get right is the one starring Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.<br /><br />The film tells paralleled stories of two woman exchanging homes for a much needed break from reality.  Iris is currently devastated that her ex-boyfriend Jasper is now engaged to a co-worker.  Amanda is disgusted with her cheating boyfriend and overwhelmed by her job.  The two, in an act of desperation, exchange lives (homes, cars...the whole shebang) and attempt to unwind and refocus.  Of course, where there are desperate women there are kind hearted men who are tailor-made for helping them `refocus', and so insert Jude Law and...um...Jack Black?  Law plays Graham, Iris's brother, who infiltrates Amanda's alone time and makes himself a staple in her `healing'.  Jack Black plays Miles, a music composer who ignites a spark in Iris.<br /><br />The script and pacing of the film only half work.<br /><br />I will say that what I did enjoy about the film and that balance of `two stories' was that it was able to bounce around so that we didn't lose complete interest in the couples in question, which it would have been very easy to do.  Sadly though, the film is overly long and the couples themselves, at least Winslet and Black, are miscast.  Diaz and Law are quite good, especially Law who kind of OWNS this movie.  I love Kate Winslet with all my almighty heart and consider her an acting goddess and the single best working actress today, but romantic comedies are not her thing.  She just comes off dull and uninteresting, especially in the films first half.  She does pick up her pace a bit towards the end, but by then we have lost interest and moved on to Diaz, who is totally in her element and shines brightly here.  Black tries, and he works better than expected, but you can tell that he is in over his head.<br /><br />Nancy Meyers has a certain way about making her movies.  She understands certain aspects of the love game, but she also doesn't know how to edit herself.  I remember a similar problem (although not as unevenly toned) in `Something's Gotta Give', a film that hit a lot of great marks and then allowed itself to wear out its own welcome.  That is a problem I have with `The Holiday'.  It is too loosely constructed.  Some tighter pacing and some much needed edits could have consolidated this film and made it move quicker and hit harder.  Instead, it tends to drag on in places and loses some of its charm along the way.<br /><br />The film as a whole is ok, but I wanted more than that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Hardcore Classic Film of the 80's!!!"></head><body><p>This is an awesome classic! It has been a few years since I've seen it. I saw it on tv today, and decided to refresh my memory. A group of friends called the Goonies face foreclosure on their families' homes. When Mouth, Chunk, and Data visit Mikey and Brandon Walsh on their last day together, and begin to rummage through the attic, and find a treasure map. The group set out to find the treasure and meet a lot of misadventures along the way. I highly recommend that you hang out with THE GOONIES!!!</p></body></html>

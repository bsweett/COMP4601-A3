<meta name="summary" content="STILL FULL OF GENIUS 9.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Pulp Fiction is still regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, and why should it change from that rank? This movie is basically a crime drama that follows the stories of different gangsters and what happens to them throughout the movie. The movie can be really funny in certain areas while giving you the classic drama feel, along with a recreation of how people seem to live. There is drug use and a lot of language, so parents shouldn't let there kids watch this movie, because it's an adults movie, and plus most kids don't know how to appreciate something this good(Stupid High School Musical! Way to ruin the meaning of quality!).</p></body></html>

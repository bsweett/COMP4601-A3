<meta name="summary" content="One Strange, Quirky Movie That Kept Me Laughing!!"></head><body><p>Just watched this last night on dvd.... I enjoyed this artsy, quirky film immensely and enjoyed that it kept me laughing at unexpected moments with its dark humor! The acting, storyline and the dark comedy on the whole makes "In Bruges" an excellent movie to watch...<br /><br />Must say that "In Bruges" is also a refreshing change of pace in terms of movies that are the usual slapstick comedies that get old to watch after a while!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mediocre"></head><body><p>This is mediocre, at best. Watchable, yes, with children, but just barely. The plot is very predictable. The ending is weak. The effects are marginal (some are downright bad). The editing is not very good, either. If it weren't a serious attempt, it almost could be a classic late night show (which is not always a good thing). Pass this one by.</p></body></html>

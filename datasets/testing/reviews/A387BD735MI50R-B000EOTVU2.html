<meta name="summary" content="A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"></head><body><p>This film is definitely several notches above the average horror flick. It overturns a number of slasher film cliches.<br /><br />First of all, you get to know the three victims as interesting individuals before the horror starts. These three are not the usual gum-chewing teens tossing a few random, pointless curses at each other before they encounter the psychopath. They are three intelligent, likeable people - which makes their ultimate brutal ordeal all the more wrenching.<br /><br />Then the ending is not what you expect. These characters' journey into hell will leave you shaken and depressed. I don't at all mean to make the real-life sufferings of people around the world frivolous with the comparison - nevertheless, I did walk away from this movie with a feel for what the the victims of mass genocide and attempted mass genocide in places like Rwanda and Cambodia may have gone through - a better feel than I generally have gotten from watching all the serious documentaries on those slaughters. Here I was plummeted right into proximity with a madman bent on butchery. I was forced to FEEL what it was like.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of analysis of why we flock to horror movies. Some say we are all sadists at heart and are getting our jollies vicariously. Some say that we go in order to rehearse what we might do if we are ever actually forced into such extremis. For me - I sense a certain amount of hidden malevolence in the average person, the person who starts out saying, 'Hi' and smiling - but who is harboring or can be triggered into a hatred that will end up undercutting life. And seeing this transformation, this shedding of the sheepskin - graphic, exaggerated, and overt on screen - somehow makes all the real-life hidden agendas around me more manageable, more expected.<br /><br />Whatever your motives for going to horror films, Wolf Creek will probably satisfy them. But don't listen to the running DVD commentary afterwards. The actors' and director's remarks don't add anything of interest. And their giggling, lightweight banter destroys the deadweight mood of the film itself.<br /><br />There's one last reason to see this movie. The scenery is a fifth main character in the action. You get a sweeping view of the Australian outback - of the remarkable meteor crater formation the characters visit - of the emptiness. You'll feel you've been there. You may think twice about paying an actual visit anytime soon.</p></body></html>

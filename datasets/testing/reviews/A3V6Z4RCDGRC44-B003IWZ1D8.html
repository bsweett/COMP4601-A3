Part of the fantastic thrill of watching the tale unwind is learning the ins and outs of what is going on. You probably already know the keynote situation - a knife in a shower scene - but luckily that comes early on, so you don't spend half the movie wondering what it is all about.<br /><br />Many aspects make this movie spectacular and worthy of the #18 AFI top movie rating. The black and white filming makes every shadow and corner suspect. It's not a movie about gore and blood - in fact many scenes deliberately scare you without showing you what actually is going on. Your imagination supplies the activity. It's more a movie about nerves - about wondering what is going to happen, worrying about consequences.<br /><br />You can tell how amazing a movie is when, many decades later, a new director works to make a scene-by-scene reproduction of the movie with modern actors, just to help bring the story to a new generation. Viggo Mortensen fans are familiar with this one.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Affleck leads DAREDEVIL's dark, edgy thrill-ride"></head><body><p>After the hugh success of SPIDER-MAN, it was obvious to many film observers that superhero films were back in vogue in a major fashion.  DAREDEVIL is the first film since SPIDER-MAN to test that theory and, while the film isn't perfect, it doesn't disappoint.  This movie tells the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who lost his sight when his eyes are exposed to toxic waste in childhood.  However, his remaining senses are amplified to a superhuman degree.  When his father is murdered by mob enforcers, Murdock decides to fight injustice in his own unique way.  By day, he works as a lawyer while he metes his own dark brand of justice nightly as the red-garbed vigilante, Daredevil.  Eventually, he meets and falls in love with the shipping heiress, Elektra (Jennifer Garner).  However, both of them are drawn into tragedy when they become unwittingly involved in the schemes of the city's crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his half-crazed assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell).  <p>At first glance, Affleck would be an unconventional choice for a superhero lead as he tends to play affable, yet somewhat bland, leading men-types, but he pulls it off quite well. You can believe that this is a man who is driven to fight crime while fighting his own inner demons. Also, with so many other characters competing for attention, Affleck succeeds in making and keeping the character as a major focus in the film.  This is opposed to the Batman films where the hero was lost among the villians and supporting characters. Garner is both beautiful and lethal as his love-interest. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin doesn't have an awful lot to do, but he does make the most of his appearances as the man-mountian behind the crime syndicate.  Colin Farrell is probably the only actor in the film who camps things up a bit as Bullseye, but he succeeds in making him a character to be feared even when we chuckle at his quirks.  <p>Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson obviously has a love for the material, having adapted it from the classic Frank Miller-written comics.  He also keeps the film going at a good clip, keeping the film at just over 100 minutes.  However, it would've been nice to see some character motivations more fleshed-out.  The plotline where Joe Pantoliano's newspaper reporter is looking to expose Daredevil is practically glossed over and it would've been nice to see more of the Kingpin's motivations. But this is mere quibbling on my part.  Johnson and his cast treat the material with respect and the film is never allowed to drag. Indeed, it succeeds where the last 2 Batman films failed in presenting its dark hero.  While DAREDEVIL probably won't reach the heights achieved by SPIDER-MAN, it is still a worthy entry in the superhero derby. Definitely one to recommend.</p></body></html>

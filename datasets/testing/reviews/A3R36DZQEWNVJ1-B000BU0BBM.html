<meta name="summary" content="not the worst of the year but a very big disappointment"></head><body><p>The Brothers Grimm (* 1/2) comes off as a what the hell was that boo disappointment movie Directed by Terry Gilliam, who I like, but this really is a far cry from his other movies like Twelve Monkeys and The Fisher King. Will Grimm, played by Matt Damon, the good Ben Affleck (upcoming Scorsese movie The Departed, Dogma) who loses the accent along the way somewhere in the film and his jittery brother Jake Grimm, played by Heath Ledger (Lords Of Dogtown, 10 Things I Hate About You), are two brothers who make up stories, well Jake does the work and Will plays along with it. In the beginning the brothers vanquish a witch from a town, which is a fake, they made it up. Then comes the real deal where they go to a village where 11 girls have gone missing...two including one dressed up like Little Red Riding Hood and the other named Greta (Gretel). The Grimm brothers set out, with a huntress, played by Lena Headey (The Cave, Gossip). Her father vanished a long time ago and it was so obvious that the wolf in the woods was her father..duh. She tells them about this witch, this witch who was in a high tower and over the years she withered and died. The Grimm Brothers then set out and find that the forest is alive and maybe it's not in their imagination. Then, they find out that the witch is still in the high tower and see needs 12 girls for their youth. Funniest part in the entire movie was when actor Peter Stormare (Constantine, The Big Lebowski) kicks a kitty cat into a spinning whirly device. The rest is a big mixed bundle of disappointment...granted, there are some clever ideas in there but it just didnt cut it for me. Also starring Monica Bellucci (The Matrix Revolutions, Brotherhood Of The Wolf) and Jonathan Pryce (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Ronin). What the hell was with the muddy ginger bread cookie man? Did we need that Terry Gilliam? No...what about the horse swallowing the girl? No, No. Ledger and Damon do what they must in this very off movie. When I saw the shiny gold ring in the movie I was remembering back to Lord Of The Rings and I was expecting Viggo Mortensen or Orlando Bloom to pop out and shove the Brothers aside and show them how it's done. Peter Stormare's French man is annoying as hell</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bland modern day bank heist"></head><body><p>An aging Harrison Ford stars as Jack Stanfield V.P of security in a Seattle based bank undergoing a merger with a larger instituion.  Ford is introduced to business entrepreneur Bill Cox played by Paul Bettany who proposes an attractive business proposition.  Bettany however has quite a bit more in mind.<br /><br />Using a home invasion reminiscent of a dumbed down version of the classic "The Desperate Hours", Bettany and his crew of computer hackers and thugs kidnap Ford's wife Beth played by Virginia Madsden and his two kids.  He uses threats to their safety to coerce Ford to transfer 100 million dollars from his bank into Bettany's offshore accounts.<br /><br />Even with a good cast starring Alan Arkin, Robert Patrick and a plucky Mary Lynn Rajskub of "24" fame, the film flounders under the weight of an utterly predictable sophomoric plot.  That a timeworn looking Ford still has enough fuel in his tank to single handedly thwart both an attack on his family and his bank in action hero style is just too much of a stretch.</p></body></html>

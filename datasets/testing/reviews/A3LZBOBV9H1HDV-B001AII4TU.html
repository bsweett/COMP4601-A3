<meta name="summary" content=""Shrek The Third" is great!"></head><body><p>"Shrek The Third" is great! Mike Myers (as Shrek), Eddie Murphy (as Donkey), Cameron Diaz (as Princess Fiona), and Antonio Banderas (as Puss In Boots), return as their characters from the previous "Shrek" sequel. The directing by Chris Miller is great. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (who also did the music to the first two "Shrek" movies) is great. The film editing by Michael Andrews (who also film edited "Shrek 2" (2004) is great. The production design by Guillaume Aretos (who also did the production design to "Shrek 2") is great. The art direction by Peter Zaslav is great. This is a great sequel to the original and it is faithful to the original and its sequel.</p></body></html>

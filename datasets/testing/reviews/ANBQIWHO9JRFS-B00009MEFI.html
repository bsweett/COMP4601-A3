<meta name="summary" content="The very definition of High-Concept"></head><body><p>'Phone Booth' was one of those movies where I found myself both very interested but still skeptical: It had a very intriguing concept, but could it fly as a feature length film? The answer is yes, though Schumacher and Cohen knew to play it safe and bring this one in as quickly as possible, as it clocks in at a mere 75 minutes, not including the credits.  I generally like films that are long and slow and layered, but it's also great to see a film where the makers can see the limits within the setup and only take it just as far as it'll go. What can I say, it's just a very entertaining, relatively intelligent thriller with lotsa great dialogue, solid performances and an energetic visual style.  Good stuff.<br /><br />It's seems unlikely that anyone won't know it already, but I'll provide a brief plot synopsis: Colin Farrell plays a slimy, lying PR man who at the films open goes out to a phone booth to make a call to his potential mistress. Shortly after he finishes talking to her the phone begins to ring, and he picks it up to find a murderous madman, voiced beautifully by Kiefer Sutherland, on the line. It seems that the caller isn't terribly pleased with Farrell's lifestyle and wants to teach him a lesson via his sniper rifle. He's not just going to kill him, however; he's got bigger things planned. I certainly could go on, and lotsa stuff was revealed in the trailer, but now that it's been a couple of years since this came out people might not remember, and I don't wanna give anything away unnecessarily. Suffice to say that Cohen and Schumacher find a way to wring a lot more out of the situation than you'd probably anticipate, and there are a couple of really very surprising developments.<br /><br />Stylistically, 'Phone Booth' is a very modern, rather derivative film, coming across as a combination of David Fincher and '24'. Schumacher's use of the split screen stuff occasionally comes across as unnecessary and overdone, but it all works well as a whole, allowing the movie to maintain interest, visually despite the fact that it's mostly just a buncha people standing around.<br /><br />The performances are solid and professional. Some have complained about Farrell's accent, and I'll admit that I didn't find it totally convincing, but I stopped noticing it after a while. (Plus, all the New York accents I ever hear come from TV and Movies, so I guess I don't really even know how accurate it is.) More significantly, Farrell just finds the right balance in the role, showing Stu to be quite a scuzzbag, but still kinda likable anyway. Sutherland is great as the Caller, and I suspect that how much you like this movie will be predicated on how much you enjoy his character. I found him enormously entertaining, very funny and with a lotta classic lines. (The best one: Towards the beginning Stu says he doesn't believe the Caller and threatens to hang up the phone, so the Caller cocks his rifle. He says: 'Now doesn't that just torque your jaws? I love that. You know like in the movies just as the good guy is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun. Now why didn't he have it cocked? Because that sound is scary.') Nobody else has too big of a role. Forest Whitaker plays the captain whose trying to figure out just what the hell is going on here, and he acquits himself nicely, edging along the cop-character cliches while not actually falling prey to them. Unfortunately, the film feature the lightweight non-actress Katie Holmes, but as fate would have it she's playing a lightweight, naive wannabe actress, so she works out alright.<br /><br />The film gets a little speech-heavy and preachy at the end, but what can I say, I thought it worked. The speeches were well written enough, and delivered under relatively plausible circumstances. I've heard the film called a morality play, and I think that describes it pretty well, but it never forgets that the first goal of any film should be to entertain. It also ended more effectively than I'd anticipated. I didn't think they'd be able to wrap it up very well, but they found a way.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done. Definitely one of the best thrillers in recent memory.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

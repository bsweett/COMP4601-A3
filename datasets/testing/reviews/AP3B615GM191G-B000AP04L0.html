<meta name="summary" content="A Magnum Opus For Working Frustration"></head><body><p>Some people are completely fulfilled in their job-related pursuits, are supported by their co-workers, and put all their heart into their work.  Then, there are those for whom the exact opposite to all three of those statements.  "Office Space" is for that latter group.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Office Space" focuses primarily on Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a beaten-down cubicle drone who is just going through his life/job on autopilot.  When a visit to a hypnotherapist goes horribly wrong, however, Peter snaps out of his funk & starts doing things on his own terms...with predictable hilarious results!<br /><br />Where this movie really succeeds is that it perfectly captures the essence of an un-fulfilling work environment.  Most anyone who has ever held a job can relate, but those (like myself) who have lived a "job from hell" scenario will cringe all the more and laugh all the heartier.<br /><br />The auxiliary cast is also spectacular.  Gary Cole as boss "Bill Lumbergh" has now become a classic performance, while such actors as Stephen Root ("Milton), Jennifer Aniston ("Joanna"), David Herman ("Michael Bolton"), & Ajay Naidu ("Samir") turn in spot-on comedic gems.<br /><br />I consider this to be one of my favorite films of all-time for its ability to capture (through humor and satire, of course) the dysfunctional work environment.  If you haven't "lived it", then perhaps this type of humor will not appeal to you.  For the desk-jockeys, sales-clerks, and pencil-pushers of the world, however, be prepared to laugh long and hard!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent thriller!"></head><body><p>The majority of us are law abiding citizens but we can't resist watching a good robbery, especially if there's some humour thrown in as well. The Italian Job (1969) is one of the best but in 2001 Steven Soderbergh remade the Rat Pack classic Ocean's Eleven (1960) which is notable not just for an audacious robbery plan but its rich ensemble of Hollywood talent, but is it any good?<br /><br />The film begins with Danny Ocean (George Clooney) being released from prison and immediately hooking up with a multitude of talented criminals spread throughout the US. Ocean makes up the elusive eleven of the title which includes Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), Frank Catton (Bernie Mack), brothers Turk (Scott Caan) and Virgil Malloy (Casey Affleck), Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison), Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Yen (Shaobo Qin), Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon). Ocean's target is $150 million held in the vault of a casino owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), and despite the reservations of the men he recruits at pulling off the heist they all sign up for the challenge. Complications arise, however, when Ocean's group learn that Benedict's lover Tess (Julia Roberts) just happens to be the estranged wife of Ocean which threatens to ruin the entire heist.<br /><br />Following his release from prison at the outset, Ocean is quickly breaking the rules of his parole and forming a lucrative gang to complete a challenging robbery that is deemed nigh on impossible. The notable members are Linus who is an expert pickpocket and Yen who Rusty Ryan first introduces Ocean to when they watch his circus performance; an outstanding acrobat ideal for avoiding security sensors and facilitating the gang's acquisition of the loot. The other members all have their individual roles from posing as businessmen wanting their goods putting in the casino's vault, to working the tables or posing as porters. Ocean's gang may seem as dissimilar a group as you could hope to meet but together they are a formidable force, planning meticulously with a replica of the vault they intend to break through despite the presence of guards, security sensors and doors whose codes change multiple times during the day. Getting into the vault is one thing but managing to walk out with $150 million in bags is not the most straightforward task. As the audience we know that this gang will have their close calls and there are many here, be it members posing as guards and being stopped in the corridors suddenly or the athletic Yen nearly stumbling a few times when his moment arrives in the vault.<br /><br />The love triangle between Ocean, Tess and Benedict is relevant but it is also fairly predictable what's going to happen. Despite being the head of the thieving operation, Ocean cannot resist joining his wife at a restaurant table while she waits for her new lover. Tess is adamant she wants nothing to do with Ocean, citing his lies and deceit as perfectly good reasons why she has nothing to say to him but his very presence clearly has an effect on her even though she professes to be loyal to Benedict. Ocean's encounter with Tess leads to a meeting with Benedict who is suspicious of everyone in his casino so the sight of a recently paroled criminal sets alarm bells ringing. Ocean's movements are not overlooked by his gang with Linus monitoring his encounter with Tess and Benedict and leaving Rusty Ryan no choice but to assume control of the operation for fear of Ocean blowing the whole thing. Linus is drafted in for a key role in the heist while a distraught Ocean is pushed to the background despite being the initial brains behind the robbery. With this setback are the gang's detailed plans left in shreds?<br /><br />Ocean's Eleven moves along at a fast pace and the heist itself is indeed the high point, being complex and precarious at every turn. Watching the ice cool Benedict begin to sweat as his impenetrable casino is suddenly breached is a sheer delight. The ending reveals another layer of intricacy to the plot that the audience will struggle to see coming but even the ruthless Benedict is left in awe at the audacity of the gang he has become a victim of. The outcome of the love triangle is very predictable and was something of a downside to the film for me. Tess doesn't want Ocean in her life at the outset but in the blink of an eye she quickly changes her mind! There is still a surprising outcome for one of the members of the group, it's a not a straightforward getaway for everyone involved and it makes for a more satisfying ending.<br /><br />Ocean's Eleven is a fast-paced heist thriller with some moments of comedy thrown in for good measure. It boasts an impressive array of Hollywood talent who are never allowed to dominate the screen for long. By no means a masterpiece this is still an enjoyable film that should appeal to a wide audience.</p></body></html>

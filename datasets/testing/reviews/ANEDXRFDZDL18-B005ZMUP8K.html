<meta name="summary" content="Jack Sparrow rocks..."></head><body><p>I really enjoy Dead Man's Chest. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), was a scene stealer, and as far as I'm concerned Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom were just so much dead weight. The plot is rather simple, standard action affair, but the special effects were breathtaking. I do wish they'd toned down the 'barnacles' on the dead sailors. Some of the scenes were gag-provoking. Jack Sparrow was the hero of the show, fun to watch in every scene he was in.<br /><br />On the negative side, I do think some scenes were a bit overdone. The scene with Orlando and the ex-captain fighting on the water wheel was just hokey and lasted too long. Likewise some scenes on the ghost ship were just a little sickening (the barnacles) etc.<br /><br />Overall, a fun, fast action flick. Sure to entertain.</p></body></html>

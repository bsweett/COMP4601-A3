<meta name="summary" content="Lots of Bloody Fun"></head><body><p>&quot;Blade ll&quot; offers exactly what you would expect:  Lots of martial arts fighting, thin plotting and ghoulish vampires, but the surprise is in director Guillermo Del Toro exhilirating and stylish approach, which elevate the film above its somewhat far-fetched plot, even for a vampire movie.  Wesley Snipes reprises his role as the titular vampire hunter, and with just as much aching cool as he did the first time around.  Within the first ten minutes of the film, he saves his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from torture, and a new breed of vampire shows its face.  A Reaper.  A super-strong and almost indestructible foe that turns it vampire victims into new Reapers and this gang is led by a jolly good fellow Jared Nomak (Luke Goss).  Seeing Nomak as a threat, the Vampire Nation offers a truce to Blade for his help in hunting down and killing the super-vamps.  But of course, nothing for Blade is what it seems, especially with David S. Goyer's occasionally juvenile script.<p>But Snipes (who also co-produced the film) and Del Toro shine in this kind of movie.  Intense fight scenes comprise nearly half the film, involving swords, guns, bombs and plenty of fist-flying, giving fans of the first film what they really want:  Blade kicking much Vampire ass.  But the fights are sometimes marred by painfully obvious computer effects, and a couple painfully trashy shots.  But these are minor quips, seeing as Snipes is so freakin' cool as the big bad Daywalker, and Del Toro stages the battles with intense, macabre applomb.  If your in the mood for escapist fare with plenty of bloody violence, &quot;Blade ll&quot; fits the bill nicely.  The DVD includes a making of, details on the Vampire make-up and interviews with Del Toro, Snipes and David S. Goyer.</p></body></html>

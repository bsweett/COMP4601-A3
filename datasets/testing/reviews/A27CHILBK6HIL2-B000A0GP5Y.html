<meta name="summary" content="A Very Annoying, Borring, and Tasteless Movie"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Here we have another watered down remake that tries to take a very well done film and open it to the general public.  The film, while although enjoyable at times, is full of cheap humor, bad dialogue, and illogical events.  The story follows Paul Crewe, a washed up pro quarterback who lands himself a 3 year sentence for getting drunk and stealing his girlfriend's very nice car.  In the original instead of arguing with his girlfriend he beats her and then steals the car, so we already know that any seriousness from the original is lost.  The very first shot of the film is a flashy split screen shot of a girl swimming in the pool in her bikini.  The camera follows her out of the pool to reveal a big party going on, then we follow Courtney Cox Arquette upstairs to find her lovely boyfriend all drunk and watching football.  All the camera does is focus on her bulging bosoms for her entire 5 minute screen time.  We already know the target audience so it's not a shock, but it's just degrading to the original work it's being based off of.  Once Crewe is ordered to assemble a team to face the guards as a "practice" game then the eye rolling will come.  You watch and think to yourself, "These guys are criminals?"  I mean they are all little annoying asses, and the jokes are also tasteless.  Tracy Morgan makes a cameo as the head of the gay guys in the prison, and they become the cheerleaders for the convict team, yeah ha-ha, gay jokes, men in skimpy clothing with pom-poms.  Later, when Sandler is recruiting players he goes to see this huge hispanic guy who is locked up in a room that shares the likes of Hannibal Lecter's cell in Silence of the Lambs.  Sandler finds him banging his head against the concrete and asks "what's his problem", the guard replies "he's crazy".  Maybe that's how they'll depict Hannibal Lecter in the remake 20 years from now.  So, once they finally recruit this guy who was being guarded 24 hours a day in a room with bullet proof paneling, he is let out to play.  That's right, they just let him out of his hold so that he can practice football, no guards supervising.  The turning point of the film is so out of place because they try to make it serious, and it just doesn't flow with the tone the movie already established.  As for the entire plot, it does not stray away from the formula one bit.  C'mon, guess who wins at the end.  It's not hard since you know what is coming.  They assemble the team, they practice, all odds are against them, they have to overcome the death of a friend (won't say who though), Sandler has to choose between being faithful to his team or be selfish and throw the game . . .  guess the ending.  I thought Burt Reynolds would come to lift this movie, but he didn't.  I laughed out loud maybe 5 or 6 times.  Don't get me wrong, I like Adam Sandler, but this movie is lacking any social commentary and impact that the original had, just like his other remake, Mr. Deeds.  What is Sandler trying to do? Remake classics into crappy comedies? Whatever it is, it's not too hot.<br /><br />ACTING:  You won't buy Adam Sandler as an all pro quarterback for one bit, not at all.  You'd think he'd do some body building for the role, but nah-uh.  As for his acting, he acts the same throughout, and it's funny that he has no funny moments in the film.  It's all the supporting cast of cameos and nobodies.  Don't worry, Rob Schnieder is there like he always is with the "You can do it!" line.  He also gets Allen Covert in there as he usually does with his movies.  Chris Rock is pretty unfunny too.  All the funny comes from the wimpy convicts and some mega slowmotion football hits as a huge guy knocks down the little guy.  Those are always funny.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The original had a social commentary, it was a stronger film.  This film shouldn't carry the same name because it's just a tasteless mix of big hits, crappy jokes, and illogic.  It's also filled up the whazoo with Reebok product placement.</p></body></html>

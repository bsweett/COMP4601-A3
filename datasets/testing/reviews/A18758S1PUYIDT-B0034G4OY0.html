<meta name="summary" content="Good interweaving of stories, little payoff"></head><body><p>Not that there has to be a clear-cut resolution for everything, but I would have liked a bit more of the story told explicitly, especially since there are high emotional stakes for the three main characters:  Matt Damon, the reluctant psychic who can communicate with the dead; a young English boy who wants to talk to his dead twin brother; and a French woman who survives a tsunami while on vacation.<br /><br />All three come together towards the end in England, yet there does not seem to be any kind of payoff overall.<br /><br />Good performances, however, make it good enough to watch.</p></body></html>

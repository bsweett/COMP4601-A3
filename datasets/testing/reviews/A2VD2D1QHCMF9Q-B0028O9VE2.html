<meta name="summary" content="Watch Flor!"></head><body><p>This movie is worthwhile for the opportunity to watch the Spanish actress Paz Vega as Flor.  She is beautiful, and charming, although her character in this movie is a bit predictable.  The other main characters I found offensive, but perhaps that is part of the plot.<br /><br />Sandler has a problem completing a sentence.  He plays a wimpish character who, as Flor said, acts like a old Mexican housewife.  And Leoni's character was too abrasive, abusive, stupid and self-preoccupied to be believed.  That she and Sandler and their two children were part of the same family just did not make any sense, either in real life or in fiction.<br /><br />The movie barely had a story line, so without interesting characters there is nothing there.  But watch it just to see Paz Vega.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Drama"></head><body><p>Drama. Beginning to think I have become so used to TV action, dialogue, that I have trouble taking the pace of a true drama. Liked this film. This drama. Predictable for sure but liked it anyway. Liked Clooney but Academy Award performance? Not in my mind. Certainly not a comedy or funny. Not despressing but could drag some souls down. Neither a recommend or no recommend.</p></body></html>

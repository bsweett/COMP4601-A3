<meta name="summary" content="The Manchurian Candidate, an updated political thriller"></head><body><p>The political importance of The Manchurian Candidate, a movie based on the novel written by Richard Condon, is excellent because it teaches us how power corrupts and absolute power has the ability to corrupt people, process and society absolutely. Lina Navarini and I set out to see the version played by Frank Sinatra in 1962, followed by this remake by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />The first movie takes place during the aftermath of the Korean War, but now the plot takes place after the Gulf War. Now played by Denzel Washington, Bennet Marco is an infantryman who experiences recurring nightmares because he was kidnapped and through an implant on his back and another in his teeth, the enemy is able to plant false memories in his mind and in particular, in the mind of Raymond Shaw. Mr. Shaw, candidate to Vice President of the US, upon receiving a phone call that triggers his mind to do whatever he is told, is capable of murder, without "guilt or fear" therefore, little risk of being discovered.<br /><br />The purpose behind altering the neuron connections and re-wiring the brain of these Americans is a desire to place a man in the White House that would do anything the enemy desires. Imagine the power the enemy would have if they were to control the United States of America.<br /><br />But Bennett Marco is haunted by dreams with images that make him question reality. The platoon told the world that Sergeant Raymond Shaw, played by Liev Schreiber had rescued the platoon soldiers, to the exception of two who perish. He has told the world that Raymond Shaw saved them, when in his dream, he remembers Shaw murdering one of the soldiers.<br /><br />Shaw is decorated as a war hero, given the medal of honor, a distinction that is rarely awarded, but his dreams make him question whether they have been brained washed to believe Shaw had saved them. At first, Sinatra feels that he may be going mad and goes to see military medical personnel in search for help and support. They too believe he is experiencing post traumatic disorders, and they remove him from any duty, asking him to go on vacation and to rest.<br /><br />But another member of the platoon is also having the same type dreams and soon they realize that there is more to this story than meets the eye. Denzel Washington becomes Mr. Shaw's nightmare as he gets close to him and unravels a rather sad personal story, where we learn that Shaw's mother has manipulated her son's life in search for fame and glory for she has plans for him, to transform him into the President of the United States. The mother's role is masterfully played by Meryl Streep, now a Senior Senator who took over the vacant seat left by her husband. She is ruthless, displaying a Machiavellian attitude that the end justifies all means to get her son elected and we soon find ourselves hating this manipulative, controlling, and mad woman. As with the first version, this movie is simply a magnificent political thriller, don't miss it!</p></body></html>

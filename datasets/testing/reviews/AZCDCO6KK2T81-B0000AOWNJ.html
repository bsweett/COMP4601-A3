The disturbing images, mounting suspense, clever editing, intelligent script, and solid direction all contribute to making this very horrific and haunting film a roller coaster ride of terror that stays with you long after the experience of watching it is over.  Naomi Watts is outstanding in the lead role, but all the supporting cast members are terrific as well.  If you like or love the blood and gore kinds of films, then this movie will certainly disappoint you as the focus is on character, story, and mood (which is wonderfully done due to the suberb cinematography, unique special effects, and make-up).<br /><br />This is an outstandingly produced film and one not to be missed.  It is also noteworthy that it's sequel is as equally good and does exactly what a sequel should do and that is continue the storyline and not rehash the original.  Both films belong in your DVD library and are nothing less than riveting.  I and my family, thanks to the PG-13 rating for its disturbing images and not for gore or sex, totally enjoyed this very effective chiller and its sequel.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MEET THE PARENTS...er...I mean FOCKERS"></head><body><p>Normally, sequels try to disguise the fact that they are simply attempting to create the same profit from a cheap remake of the original.  They do this by trying to retain the chemistry of the first film, while providing a new plotline for the characters to travel down.  MEET THE FOCKERS, on the other hand, fails to provide even the smallest bit of originality.  What the producers of this film have done is take the same characters, overdeveloped them a little, and forced them to run down the same plotline.  I'm serious.  One gets the impression while watching this movie that they simply erased MEET THE PARENTS from the original script and inserted "FOCKERS."<br /><br />Of course, the film is not entirely without merit.  On the plus side, MEET THE FOCKERS takes itself a little less seriously.  While Stiller's parents, played by Hoffman and Streisand, are quite over-the-top and ridiculous, they have moments of rational clarity and insight that prevent their characters from becoming outright annoying.  Unlike the Byrnes' family, who is seemingly unaware of their ticks and flaws, the Fockers are aware of their quirkiness and I enjoyed that aspect of the film.<br /><br />While I found myself laughing at certain points, however, this sequel was more painful to watch in a variety of ways.  De Niro's character, Jack Byrnes, is difficult to watch in MEET THE FOCKERS.  In the first film, Jack came across as uptight and conservative, but generally a rational (if not overly-rational) man.  In this film, however, Jack just comes across as a heartless jerk and we are no longer convinced that Stiller needs to pander to his sensibilities, for anyone who does so would be equally soulless.  Finally, the film did not know when to end itself.  The last 30 minutes drag on at an unbearable rate and I could not wait for the film to end.  In summary, if you liked the original, you might want to check out this sequel.  But I have a hunch that it will disappoint you.</p></body></html>

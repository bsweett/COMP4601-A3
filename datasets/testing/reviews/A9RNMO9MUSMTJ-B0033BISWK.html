<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good movie....for what it is....."></head><body><p>So much negative stuff for this movie...so i made sure i knew all of it before<br />watching it.  Bottom line...i found it pretty good. At least you see the creatures<br />and not just glimpses...yes they have hand held cameras at the beginning...but they<br />dont shake as much as previous stupid movies...the shots are from news types feeds.<br />The shakes are acceptable for this movie. I was glad once they dropped most of the<br />news feed and got to the movie....and how about that main character.....hummm that<br />quite some casting they must have done......not.<br />  Once the movie starts moving,,i found it interesting and by the end of the movie,<br />i was hoping they come out with the sequel a.s.a.p. cause there is so much<br />possibilities....earth invasion...partial future invasion...<br />Good for a view.</p></body></html>

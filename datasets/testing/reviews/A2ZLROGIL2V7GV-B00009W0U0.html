<meta name="summary" content="Unforgiving and Terrifying..."></head><body><p>Rob Zombie has made one hell of a disturbing and frightening horror movie that is unforgettable and unsettling.  Forget those "fun" horror films made for teens, this is the real deal.  As soon as you finish "House of 1000 Corpses," you are literally shaking in absolute shock.  Not because it's that scary, but because it's that unrelenting and unforgiving.<p>Having a really big "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" influence in it, the film is about a young group of people who take a wrong turn and end up in a house filled with maniacs, cannibals, and murdering madmen who love to maim and torture.  What led the group to the house was a desire to find out more about the legend of Dr. Satan.  Now, they'll wish that they had never left home and have never heard the name.  "House of 1000 Corpses" takes you into Hell and back.<p>I have to admit, I had a real hard time watching it.  The movie is really brutal and uneasy to watch.  However, there's something about it that keeps you watching no matter how much you want to shut it off.  Zombie has made a successful horror movie that terrifies and shocks.  It has an undeniable feel and tone to it all that Zombie has perfected.<p>It is what it is.  It's not out to the be the Great American movie.  This movie is a horror/slasher movie and nothing more.  People who are looking for more will be disappointed, without a doubt.  Be warned, this isn't a film for the weak and sensitive.  This is not "Scream," or any other "cute" teen horror flick.  This movie is raw, dark, evil and disturbing.  That is why it is a success in my eyes.  Rob Zombie did a great job of orchestrating all of this.  I can see him doing more with this genera.  I am sure this won't be the last horror film we see from him.<p>The DVD has some cool extras.  The picture and sound quality is great.  Really gives you the sense that you are there and not just only watching it.  The menu is one of the funniest ones I have ever seen on a DVD.  Be sure to watch Captain Spaulding's greeting.  Extras included are commentary, audition footage, interviews, trailers, a featurette and more.  A lot of hard work went into the DVD, that is for sure.<p>My overall feeling about this movie is that I liked it.  It's brutal and hard to watch, but that's what Rob Zombie was going for.  Just be sure to watch it for what it is and don't try to read too much into it.  "House of 1000 Corpses" is a terrifying and uneasy ride into Hell that you won't soon forget.</p></body></html>

Do I really want to immerse myself into the heartbreaking world of drug mules? Finally, I grabbed it and sat down to watch. On several levels Maria may be the most disturbing film I've ever seen. A young girl faced with a future that leaves her feeling hopeless. Her boyfriend, selfish, young, more interested in drinking and his friends than her, offers her freedom from her life of working to help out the family. But would life with him be any more like life than the one she so wants to escape. Her job, menial, difficult and the only one out there, wears her down, especially when she has to contribute to the care and upkeep of her selfish sister and small nephew.<br /><br />A new guy heads into town, dances with her, opens up some possibilities of life that is more than mere existing. So she jumps at the challenge and opportunity that he dangles over her. Unfortunately the challenge is swallowing pellets full of drugs and the opportunity is traveling to America to spend time in a cramped hotel room waiting while her body expels 62 pellets.<br /><br />The trip goes bad in a horrific way, and Maria is left to fend for herself in New York City. Maria has to come to some heavy decisions regarding future. Everything has changed and she will never be the teenager she was.<br /><br />Aside from the horror of the situation, the film is well done and compelling. In Spanish with English subtitles with realistic dialogue peppered with the F-word. Those who like documentaries, historically accurate films, crossroads moments and raw storytelling should find Maria to be a thought provoking movie.</p></body></html>

However, the characters and plot stretch believability past the breaking point, with the result that I didn't find this movie very engaging and it left little impression on me when it was over.  I suppose I can recommend this movie to people who are in the mood for it, but there are definitely better movies available in this genre, so this isn't a top choice (despite having Angelina Jolie in the lead role).</p></body></html>

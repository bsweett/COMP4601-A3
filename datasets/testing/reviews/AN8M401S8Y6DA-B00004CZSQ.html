<meta name="summary" content="Color me bad. **  Is it worth the upgrade?  Comparisons below**."></head><body><p>The premise as most know a girl Suzy Banyon, an American ballet dancer arrives at a well known European dance academy run by mysterious teachers where nothing is as it seems.  As Suzy arrives at night in a horrible thunder and lightening storm a girl is leaving in a frenzy yelling a secret into the night, what follows is as Entertainment Weekly calls "the most vicious murder scene ever filmed".<br /><br />Director Dario Argento "paints" an effective horror story, he puts relatable people in relatable situations so we can buy into his film.  Then very cleverly has dreamlike sets bursting with colors, we as viewers subconsciously know something isn't right and I believe this use of color subtly keeps us on edge.  Even the title of the film, What is Suspiria?  I googled it to find it is a film by Dario Argento, so even the title has us subconsciously unsure going in.  Although I could be wrong on that.  Then add an unrelenting, nerve wracking, and haunting score by Goblin (one of the most effective I've experienced).  We enter with Suzy into this academy and we know something isn't right, we are experiencing what she is, it is like a dream and maybe nothing is wrong, and with the blink of an eye this dream becomes a nightmare, we can stop the dvd but what is Suzy going to do?<br /><br />To upgrade or not to upgrade.  The first set of features are also what you get on the single disc anchorbaby dvd still available for 10$.<br />Languages<br /> English (DTS 6.1)<br /> English (Dolby Digital 6.1)<br /> English (Dolby Digital 2.0)  Not available on the single disc<br /> Italian (Dolby Digital 2.0)<br /> French (Dolby Digital 2.0)<br /><br />Features (All on Anchorbay single disc)<br /># Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1<br /># DTS-ES Digital Surround<br /># Dolby Digital EX Surround<br /># Stereo<br /><br />DISC 1 EXTRAS:  (All on Anchorbay single disc)<br /><br />  * Theatrical Trailers<br />  * TV Spot<br />  * Radio Spots<br />  * "Suspiria" Music Video By Daemonia<br />  * Poster & Still Gallery<br />  * Talent Bios<br /><br />DISC 2 EXTRAS:  (All new)<br /><br />  * "Suspiria" 25th Anniversary Interviews with Co-Writer/Director Dario Argento, Co-Writer Daria Nicolodi, Cinematographer Luciano Tovoli, Composers Goblin (Claudio Simonetti, Massimo Morante, Fabio Pignatelli & Agostino Marangolo), and Stars Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini & Udo Kier<br /># French (Dolby Digital 2.0)<br /><br />The transfer and the sound are going to be the same, if you didn't own any copy i would say this 2 disc version for 5$ more is the way to go, also if your an Argento fan or fan of the film, disc 2's features most likely will be worth it to you.<br />4.5 stars<br />Hope this helps..</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Sci-fi comedy that shines on Blu-Ray!"></head><body><p>There's a hidden secret government agency known as "MIB" or "Men in Black" for short, their mission is to keep all aliens from space under wraps from the public as far as possible and to protect humanity from the scum of the universe. MIB Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has been assigned by leader Zed (Rip Torn) to find a police officer named J (Will Smith) who witnesses something unusual that could lead him to become a member of the MIB, unfornuately when a hideous bug monster disguises itself as a human farmer (Vincient D'Onofrio) who plans big plans for Earth but it's up to the MIB to solve a case and try to stop the alien menace.<br /><br />Co-starring Linda fiorentino, this is a stylish and exciting Sci-fi comedy based on a cult short-lived Malibu comic book of the same name. Barry Sonnefeld ("The Addams Family") directed this movie quite well and the acting is solid especially the smart humor that incorporated this movie, it's a satire on what if aliens were really among us yet they want to be kept under wraps among the humans. The film even offers brilliant make-up and special effects by Industrial Light and Magic and Rick Baker giving us realistic alien critters that no one has seen before on film and there's plenty of great fun in this movie that made it a pure big blockbuster among audiences and critics alike.<br /><br />This blu-ray offers nice quality pic and sound even for HD lovers with great extras like audio visual commentary, Trailer and Teaser, featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, Storyboard comparisions, Documentary, music video, galleries, interactive games, scene editing workshop, and BD-live.</p></body></html>

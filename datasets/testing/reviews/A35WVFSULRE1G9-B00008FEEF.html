She came back for the sequel, only because John Carpenter started her career and he was producing this one. Luckily she did, but her role is minimal because she is heavily sedated throughout the film which takes place where the first left off, but now in a hospital. Her dialogue is short, but her screams are back plenty. The film is pretty slow but the classic music is back,(a little higher synth), and the hospital does have many oportunities for different murders. The murders are a plenty and pretty graphic for that matter. A nurse scalded in a hottub, a doctor with a needle in his eye, a nurse with a needle to the head, and various others. This film relies on the gore to keep it going, unlike Carpenters original which showed very little blood or violence. That film was built on suspense and moodyness. This film just has Michael wandering all over the hospital in various shots. They try to build suspense toward the end, but we have all seen it before in the original. Heck as long as Michael was there, he should have had his gunshot wounds attended too, lol. Also a pretty big hospital and that small of a staff, and where are the other patients? I have never seen a hospital that dark either, they are probably the most well lit buildings on the planet. Not a bad sequel, but not awesome either. Also, no way any more sequels could have been made after this, Michael and Doctor Loomis were cooked....ahh, hollywood magic. Anyone else notice Jamie's fake wig, wow, big budget, looks like something my grandmother wore. Trivia, look for Annie, victim in the original, before the chief, her father in the film closes her eyes, she blinks. Also Dana Carvey is an assistant to the news crew when they discover the bodies from the original. Also nice ramp Michael backs up on as he falls from the balcony at the beginning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yet another 1970s remake"></head><body><p>I can't really say how this movie compares to the popular T.V. show from the 1970s.  I was only 6 years old in 1975, and STARSKY & HUTCH came on after my bedtime.  I may have seen a couple of episodes, but all I remember vividly is the trademark red Grand Torino with the white stripe.<br /><br />Insofar as the car is concerned, it has been resurrected for the current movie.  I am inclined to believe that the humor of the movie is much more of the slapstick variety than any humor displayed in the T.V. series.  There is one curious aspect about this remake, however:  unlike most remakes, this one takes place in its original epoch of the 1970s as opposed to being an "updated" rendition that takes place in the present day.<br /><br />By far & away the weakest part of the movie is the inclusion of Snoop Dog.  He is absolutely the worst actor that ever lived;  every scene he is in, is like taking the air out of a balloon.  Trying to teach him to act is like trying to teach an alligator to be a vegetarian.  He is probably the most talentless self-made millionaire the world has ever seen - bar none.  I would beg Snoop Dog to kindly disappear from the public eye - the world would be a better place for it.<br /><br />I am puzzled as to why it went the route of being rated PG-13.  After all, nobody under 35 would even be aware that there WAS an old T.V. show called STARSKY & HUTCH.  It had some opportunities for gratiutous nudity that would have made it a good old-fashioned "R" Rated slapstick comedy.  For some unknown reason, it shied away from this and ended up being a teaser flick.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie, it is OK.  Nothing great, nothing terrible.  For some, it might be nostalgic as it goes back to the 1970s.  Other people, including me, will have nightmares about DISCO making a comeback (yikes!).  If you pick up this DVD w/out expecting a whole lot, you should be fine.</p></body></html>

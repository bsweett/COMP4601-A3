He should know well the way swindlers prey on your greatest weaknesses, but being weak to whatever that "thing" is, you don't see it until it is too late. The characters here are quirky, human and interestingly deceptive. Cage gives a performance more akin to those in his earlier career (read: better); he has been hit or miss-mostly miss-for ages now. Alison Lohman as his daughter is also excellent; her recent performances in White Oleander and Big Fish certainly attest to her talents. The frenetic and ultra-talented Sam Rockwell as Roy's partner/sidekick con-man Frank is certainly one to watch; his character here is ambitious, and one fault of the film (or perhaps just the short-sighted nature of its "hero" Roy) is that Roy places too much trust in Frank. Being con-men, who lie, cheat and steal for a living, I find it hard to believe that Roy would treat Frank as openly as he does, and see him as so innocuous. This fact even jumped out and hit me at the beginning of the film, so you can imagine where the story goes once Roy's life is turned upside down with the arrival of his "daughter".</p></body></html>

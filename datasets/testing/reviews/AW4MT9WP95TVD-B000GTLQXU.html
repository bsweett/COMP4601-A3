The perfectly even, precision like blade of a slow-moving rogue wave, the large square rapidly-filling-with-water rooms, the intense human drama?  Man!  This is bad ...really bad.<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt at updating the action, but too much CGI and it looks like an overblown video game to me.  We get, like 4 or 5 minutes of exposition to get to know the charicatures, oops characters, before the big perfectly even ...<br /><br />Anywho - who cares about these people?  All the girls look alike - especially under water.  All the guys have that tortured fart-smell face.  Really  this is a stinker.<br /><br />The orginal may be no state of the art production - but compared to this it's The Godfather.</p></body></html>

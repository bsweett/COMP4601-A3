The film introduces key characters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard),  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), and most significantly, the alien symbiote, that later creates Venom.  Small time crook, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), is transformed into The Sandman, and is also revealed as the actual killer of Uncle Ben.  If that were not enough, Harry Osborn (James Franco) makes a not unexpected appearance, as the new Goblin.  There is a lot going on, but even with some meandering subplots, things seem to hold together well enough.<br /><br />While Raimi's films can certainly be appreciated for the technical achievement of successfully bringing Spider-Man to life, from the very beginning I have not been comfortable with the universe created by these films, because it strays rather far from the original comics.  In this regard, the writers did not get many things right, most importantly capturing the essence of Peter Parker.  Maguire's Parker is an incompetent goof, which is absolutely not what the Parker from the comics ever was.  The mischaracterization is attributable to a combination of the script, and Maguire's personality.  Although he has trouble keeping his mask on, Maguire is pretty good as Spider-Man.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, who plays Mary Jane Watson as written.  Which would be great, except the writers mischaracterized her as well.  The same can be said for characters like, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Harry Osborn, Gwen Stacey, and Betty Brant.  One bright spot has been the superb casting of the villains.  William Dafoe was excellent but was victim of a horrible costume.  Alfred Molina was absolutely brilliant as Doc Ock.  Thomas Hayden Church, and Topher Grace, and both give very good performances, and James Franco makes a stirring and impressive transition, into the new Goblin.  Regarded as disposable, Raimi continues the rather unfortunate trend of killing off his villains.<br /><br />Under the effects of the symbiote, Parker becomes an obnoxious, self absorbed jerk.  He treats his neighbor Usula (Mageina Tovah) like a dog, uses Gwen to degrade MJ, slugs MJ, blows off Harry face and almost kills him, and never even looks back.  Peter is a hard guy to have any empathy for.<br /><br />Venom's appearance is brief, but Topher Grace makes the most of out of what little time he has.  The special effects for Venom are outstanding.  Unfortunately the same can't be said for the lumbering giant Sandman, who looks like a pumped up escapee from a Stephen Sommers' Mummy flick.  In over forty years in comics, Spider-Man has never had problems with keeping on his mask, the way Maguire does in every film.  It is outrageous how many people have seen Spidey without his mask.<br /><br />As in life, Uncle Ben's spirit, shows only concern for Peter, not for vengeance, or even for his wife May.  The new Goblin teaming with Spidey is a really nice touch, with a fate for Harry Osborn that is sort of similar to the comic.  Likely reflecting last minute script revisions, the film has a rather untidy ending, with Peter forgiving Marko for killing Uncle Ben, and the symbiote's messy exit with Topher Grace.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 looks fantastic in blu-ray, a film that takes full advantage of the benefits of the format, with lots of cool bonus materials.  The commentary track featuring Raimi, and assorted members of the cast is very freeform, with Thomas Hayden Church, providing some witty comments.  Surprisingly, Raimi's contributions are rather minimal.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 concludes with no clear future direction.  As of January 2010, Sony Pictures has shelved plans for Spider-Man 4, after Raimi pulled out of the project.  A rumored complete reboot of Spider-Man, similar to Batman Begins, may be direction the series will take.  If this is the end of Raimi's affiliation with Spider-Man, it comes at a good time.  The foundation of Raimi's Spider-Man universe was off from the start, and it would have taken a fantastic story to rehab and reinvigorate the series.  Maguire and Dust are now a little old to still be in college, and the rocky relationship between Peter and MJ, took some major hits in Spider-Man 3.  Hopefully Spider-Man will continue in feature films, in a form closer to the original characterization by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.</p></body></html>

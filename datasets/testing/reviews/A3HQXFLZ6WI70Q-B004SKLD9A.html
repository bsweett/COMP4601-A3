I purchase based on actors, directors, etc. I check out movie reviews from imdb if I am not sure. I only buy movies that I know I will enjoy (I enjoyed this movie but the movie feels like an 80s movie about the future). About the bluray itself: Awesome video and audio. No complaints.</p></body></html>

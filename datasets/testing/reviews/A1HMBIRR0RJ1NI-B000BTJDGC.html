Based on a true story (Isn't half of them anymore?), "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" does have it's devilish pleasures, & it's creepy skin crawlers, but one has to think, have we not seen this all before, & better done? Yet, this is well worth the watch for those so inclined to be possessed by possession films!<br /><br />"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" 2005</p></body></html>

THE CGIS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME AS ARE THE VERY TALENTED HUGH JACKMAN AS WELL AS KATE BECKENSALE.  THE ACTION AND ADVENTURE ARE LITERALLY NON STOP FROM BEGINNING TO END, AND MOST OF THE ACTING BY A VERY TALENTED CAST IS FINE. PERHAPS THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I'D SAY SIT BACK AND HOLD ON TIGHT CAUSE ONCE THIS RIDE BEGINS IT'S NON STOP! GREAT FUN, GREAT POPCORN FLICK-I LOVED IT. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT FROM SUCH A FILM-YOU LITERALLY LOSE YOURSELF FOR OVER 2 HOURS IN A GREAT ESCAPADE NOT UNLIKE THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY. GO FOR IT YOU WILL HAVE A REAL BLAST.</p></body></html>

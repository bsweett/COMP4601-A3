<meta name="summary" content="Another poinltess remake"></head><body><p>Having seen the original I decided to try the remake out of curiosity. And well it was just another of those run of the mill that will wind up on DVD sale bins for 6.99 or less within a year.<br />It wasnt an awful movie, but it was just whatever<br />The original George Romero I felt was a far superior effort.<br />This remake offers us more of a horror element with z certain zombie like trait among them.<br />Gone from this version were the antidote scene, more of the military trying to catch the uninfected - with all the dead people I was wondering who was killing who and why.<br />All throughout the film there were piles of dead bodies - was this caused by the zombie like people who drank the water or were these zombies that were killed by the military<br />I never found the Romero version to be a true horror film with jolts & scares that this one offers.<br />Ultimately I found it to be pointless - with an ending which I wont give away but it was like the director couldnt think of anything else to do.<br />Certainly worth renting , and for me that was about it.</p></body></html>

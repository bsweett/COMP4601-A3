Fearlessly it tiptoes a provocative line of adolescence and terror while channeling heavy doses of emerging sexuality.  Powerful stuff, this creepy story is bound to suck the marrow from your bones and leave you floating helplessly toward your most devilish nightmare.<br /><br />It's the story of boy meets girl, a girl who harnesses a deep dark secret.  They form a unique bond as they walk a tumultuous journey of acceptance and self-discovery.<br /><br />This movie features an excellent build-up of controlled suspense and visceral fear.  The acting by the young stars is phenomenal, plus the music and special effects are top notch.  I think the most impressive part is the camera work, the visual style is just perfect with the off-center closeups, interesting angles, and some unique shots filmed from a distance.  It really gives a feeling of helplessness at crucial times.<br /><br />There is one particular scene I really hated though.  There's a vicious attack by a group of crazy kitties?!?  These wild furballs start chomping down on a woman who had just recently been bitten by the vampire.  Huh?!?  To me, this incident seemed misplaced, silly, and downright comical.<br /><br />That's the only real misstep in this otherwise immaculate Swedish horror film.  It has plenty of dynamic moments that will leave quite an impression.  Very artistic and unsettling, 4.5 stars.</p></body></html>

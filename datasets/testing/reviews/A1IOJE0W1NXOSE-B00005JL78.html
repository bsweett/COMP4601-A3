<meta name="summary" content="Crimefighters of the future"></head><body><p>Tom Cruise stars in this sci-fi thriller as the captain of a Pre-crime unit where precogs, beings who can see future murders, warn the unit as to what is about to happen, so they can prevent the murder from occurring.  His private life is full of angst because of the disappearance of his young son and the subsequent divorce by his wife.  Matters become more complicated when Cruise's character appears in the precog's thoughts of a future murder which he will commit.  His own unit turns against him and tries to capture him.  Using some clever tricks Cruise eludes them, and discovers that he is being set up, but he doesn't know who is targeting him.  The movie is set in 2054 and so it contains a lot of clever technology and special effects.  It moves at a fast pace and is just what the sci-fi fan ordered.</p></body></html>

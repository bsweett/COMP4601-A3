The plot was all over the place and there were just too many predictable moments followed by a useless need to just deliver action without a comprehendable story. It's almost like the filmakers were constantly trying to outdo themselves. Granted, the costumes are very well done, the characters look like the characters, but there are just too many ridiculous searching scenes and dull lines like ' try to shoot em in the head' and the classic ' who the f are you?' It just gets repeatative. What results is a movie that could have been better but failed to even make par. Better luck next time, guys. And if that isn't enough, there's a hint that there might be another sequel. Oh brother is all I have to say. The only thing that saved this movie was the fact that it had a lot of good cinematograpghy and style. Also, the token black guy was hilarious throughout the whole movie. But, trust me on this folks, rent it. Don't buy it.</p></body></html>

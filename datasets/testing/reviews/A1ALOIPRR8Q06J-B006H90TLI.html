Just google "Jim Emerson" and you'll find it.<br /><br />Read Jim Emerson on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and read a letter Emerson received from a viewer of the film. I promise you that these two commentaries on this film will help you better appreciate it.<br /><br />What I want to say here is something people have to understand is that a movie is not only about what it is about but also HOW it's about, what it's about. OK? Meaning is to be found in the way the story is told and what is left out of a picture sometimes adds to the picture. Less can be more and what is not there can say just as much, if not more, than what is.<br /><br />Let go of super conventional western/American hang-ups about having a concise, tiddy ending. It ends exactly where it needs to. The way the movie comes to a close has to do with what the story itself is about. Try to be more open minded and you can appreciate more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OK Remake of Beloved TV Series"></head><body><p>I approach most translations of TV series to the large screen with some trepidition.  Some are good like "The Fugitive" and...um...that's the only one I could think of.  "Get Smart" isn't bad however though not particularly memorable.  The makers were wise by stylistically departing from Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's original blueprint but sprinkle the film with some amusing references to the original.  Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway were also wise in not imitating Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as Agents 86 and 99.  What jeopardizes the film's chances to continue as a franchise is that it's bogged down with an unmemorable central plot that makes it indistinguishable from, say, "Johnny English".  Not a real disappointment but probably only worth a rental or checked out if it comes on cable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cruise and Foxx are outstanding!"></head><body><p>Michael Mann's latest movie is a thrill ride.  This is a film noir as dark streets of Los Angeles gives the film a kick.  Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance as Vincent, a gun for hire looking to kill 5 witnesses for a drug kingpin.  Unlike Cruise's previous films which makes him a meek or sexy character, this performance gives him a complete package.  Mean, Cold, Vicious.  Jamie Foxx gives another outstanding preformance as Max, the taxi driver along for the ride.  His character is complex but develops into a bold and straightforward individual.  I found it interesting that the Academy put Foxx performance in the supporting role rather than lead acting.  It would not have surprised me if he would have been considered for Best Actor with this performance.  I felt it was just a good as his groundbreaking performance in "Ray".  This is a powerful and action packed film.  Very much recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Black Swan is complicated, deeply psychological and it's more than Ballet"></head><body><p>Black Swan has been receiving a lot of acclaim since its theatrical release but it is also subject to a lot of criticism. Those who have enjoyed the movie consider it nothing short of brilliant while some other viewers were simply disgusted by it. It just shows how divided people can be over a movie. I can clearly see why some viewers disliked it: not enough dancing, the sexual scenes, some disliked Natalie Portman's acting, the movie was too weird and so on. I am one of those who really enjoyed Black Swan, at first I wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out to be an excellent film and one that I consider to be in the top movies of 2010. It was very different from other movies I've seen this past year. I loved the tone and direction taken by Darren Aronofski, Black Swan is easily distinguishable from the other movies of 2010.<br /><br />Nina Sayers is a Ballet dancer living with her mother in New York who lands the main role in an upcoming production of "Black Swan". At first Nina seems too sweet an innocent to play the Black Swan although she does seem to have the perfect characteristics for the White Swan. The director of the production doesn't see her as able to portray the role of the Black Swan even if sees her as the White Swan. Her forces and provokes her to see that passion and desire to be the Black Swan. Nina struggles with the pressure of the role and this is where the psychological part of the movie beings. The role makes her do things and act certain ways that she normally would not, it's almost as if she becomes the role.<br /><br />Black Swan is a psychological thriller, right there this is an indication that it is not for everyone. Those expecting a nice and innocent movie about Ballet will be deceived as there are some twists and it goes further and more deeply than Ballet itself. I thought it was brilliant how they showed Nina's inner psychological struggles with herself and the pressure that comes from playing the main role in the production of Black Swan.<br /><br />The hallucinations from which she suffers, her paranoid behavior and inner struggles were very well displayed.  Much of the criticism addressed at the film is due to the self-mutilation and touching and the girl on girl action scenes and I can understand how some found this disgusting and of a lack of taste.I don't think this ruined the movie but such displays on screen are very unappealing to plenty of viewers. It's interesting to watch the transition from the angelic and innocent Nina to what she eventually becomes, yet we also have the feeling that she's the same person all along but the role changed her somehow. Her relationship with her mother is an excellent example of this and the emotions displayed in the movie are very easy to relate to (I know for me it was). Also interesting to consider that the movie had a relatively low budget of 13 millions, it goes to show that movies with low budget can be successful and be acclaimed just as much if not more than big budget productions.<br /><br />Natalie Portman delivered a solid performance as Nina, I believe she was a perfect choice to play the lead role. Yes, Portman did not do all of the dancing and a double was used. But what did you expect? It takes years to be a ballerina so it was obvious that she was not going to do all of the dancing. She won an Academy award and a few other awards for best actress for her performance.  Mila Kunis also gave a solid performance as Lily. French actor Vincent Cassel did a job as Thomas Leroy, the director of the production, effective to say the least. I'm not a fan of Ballet but I do consider an art and a beautiful one at that, that's exactly what the dancing was: beautiful.<br /><br />Black Swan is brilliant, intriguing and very well made but it obviously won't be everybody's cup of tea but we're all allowed to have our own opinions aren't we? I love Black Swan because it delivers what it promised a psychological, interesting and a times complex movie, it's an experience. As much as I liked it I have to say it's a love or hate it movie, barely any middle ground. Viewers will either love and be captivated by Black Swan or absolutely hate it, as simple as that. I was pleasantly surprised and have to say I was certainly not deceived and it surpassed all the expectations I had. 5/5 from me, but that's just my 2 cents on the movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A superior animated film in every way"></head><body><p>Hadn't seen this until we saw it in blu-ray. It sure is gorgeous, and intelligent to boot, easily in the pantheon with the Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, and a few other recent masterpieces of animation.<br /><br />  Jack Black is quite perfect, Hoffman and the rest equally fine, and the script is excellent. I really can't find much to not like about Kung Fu Panda, either for kids or adults. There's enough smart humor for the elders and enough eye candy for any fan of color, composition, and animation in general. The form is used to perfection and it's clear that we are in a golden age of animation right now; the classics are coming fast and furious.<br /><br />It's also a very funny, wry movie, with sweet and snappy moments to spare.<br /><br />This is bound to be one of the dvds that parents use to pacify their kids, for decades to come. If they have to be watching the boob tube instead of reading or doing something truly useful ("Such a nice day and you're watching Kung Fu Panda AGAIN?!"), this is about as good a thing for them to be tv zombies with as can be found.<br /><br />This is in fact a work of art.<br />Not bad for a kids' flick.</p></body></html>

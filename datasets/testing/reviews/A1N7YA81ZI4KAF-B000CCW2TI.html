<meta name="summary" content=""Red Eye" Hits the Bulls Eye!"></head><body><p>Wes Craven's contribution to the horror genre has been a lot of "hits" and "misses". Several of his films have become classics of the horror genre; "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Scream" are the two best examples of this while "The Hills Have Eyes" and "The Last House on the Left" have become cult classics but let's not forget some of his other failed attempts such as "Deadly Friend", "Shocker" and "The People Under the Stairs". "Red Eye" differs from most of Craven's previous work because it's not a horror film. It's a slick, well-crafted thriller that features a great cast, some genuinely intense scenes and  heart-pounding suspense. Craven can gladly add "Red Eye" to his "hit's" list.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams plays Lisa- a young busy body who works at a chic resort Hotel. After attending her Grandmothers funeral, Lisa takes the "Red Eye" flight back home to Miami. At the airport, she bumps into a charming stranger named Jackson who offers her a drink and good conversation. As luck would have it, she ends up sitting right next to him on the flight. As their conversation progresses, it is soon made clear that the nice stranger isn't nice at all and his true motivations are exposed. It appears there is an assassination plot to kill a security official and his family but in order for it to go as planned, Jackson must convince Lisa via threatening her father's life, to authorize a room change for the unsuspecting victim in order to position him as a target. She must do it using the airplane's unreliable telephone and 30 thousand feet up in the air. Lisa tries repeatedly to outsmart her fellow passenger and a game of cat and mouse ensues.<br /><br />Finding a film that last under 90 minutes nowadays is a rare occurrence and one of the reasons this film had me glued to the screen was due to its rather short running time. There never really was a dull moment. The film didn't give me chance to get bored, get popcorn or even blink and the performances from the two leads were impressive. McAdams commanded my attention even during the film's less intense situations and Cillian Murphy proved he can be a mighty good villain.<br /><br />Like Schumacher's "Phone Booth", "Red Eye" is a fast-paced, well-executed, well directed time-waster where normal people are suddenly thrown into a violent, diabolical world of murder and mayhem. With a running time of just under 90 minutes, it hardly gives you a chance to catch your breath.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

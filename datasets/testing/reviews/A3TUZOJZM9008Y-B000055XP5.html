Usually, you can understand why scenes were exiled. In this case, it makes you wonder what director Brian Singer was thinking. Most of the material that was cut helps explain the character motivations beyond anything that had previously been seen. The relationship between Jean Grey and Wolverine actually gets some meaning to it. It helps delve into Rogue's mind a bit more as well. <p>The movie itself is curiously involving despite it's shortcomings. Is it great, no. The special effects are though. The performances, for the most part, are very good. And, it rarely falls below good. Best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Now, if only Anna Paquin could decide if she's going to actually have an accent through the whole movie (No Kevin Costner jokes.)</p></body></html>

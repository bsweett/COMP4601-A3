<meta name="summary" content="Susie's Blue Horizon - Entertaining But Overly Done!"></head><body><p>Having read the book and not thinking much of that, I decided to rent the Peter Jackson film of the same name, The Lovely Bones.  I was surprised how Jackson cut out a lot of the stuff I did not like about the book and kept in the important parts I did like.<br /><br />Susie is a bright, happy and creative girl who gets lured into a pit by Mr. Harvey.  Though not shown at the start of the film, he kills her.  And as in the book, Susie runs and touches the strange girl Ruth before Susie goes off into the unknown.<br /><br />And as in the book, her mother can't cope and eventually abandons her family and goes off to California.  The book though got deep into mom's feelings and heartbreak which are merely touched on in the film.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book I did not like was the concentration on the people in Susie's former life to a point of exhaustion.  Yes, they're getting on with it, but there is next to nothing being done about getting the murderer.  With the book, I was expecting more of a murder mystery and got too much soap in my soap opera.<br /><br />With Jackson's film, he at least pouts more emphasis into the dark soul that is Mr. Harvey.  The deep shadows the fear, despair and desire are prominent in all dealings with this guy.<br /><br />The "In Between" area where Susie is hanging is misunderstood by some critics of the film.  She is not in heaven.  She's in a Purgatory of sorts.  I do agree with critics though in the light and airiness of her life off earth -- too unrealistically happy and cheerful soon after being raped and chopped up.  Wouldn't happen.<br /><br />The book explores a lot into her former relation with Ray, which was just getting started.  In the film, his family, the accusation that he may be "the one" and so on are not explored at all --- and that's OK with me!  Too much exposition was in the book to a point of boredom and "let's get on with it" from me to author Seybold.<br /><br />Comedy relief with the mother-in-law, the drinking & smoking, the 70s music and her getting her nails done by her 8 year old grandson are priceless, silly and cute.  The cuteness doesn't last long in this film, however.<br /><br />Blue Horizon: it changes and grows with her emotions and realizations and her obsession with her family.  She knew that her father would never give her up.  "He loved me as much as he could -- I had to let him go."  Wow, what a switch!<br /><br />Moments like this, such as the crumbling gazebo as she realizes she needs to let him go are particularly poignant.<br /><br />Going over the dead of Harvey's victims is pretty gruesome, but again the book did not delve much into it.<br /><br />[Spoiler]<br /><br />The film does what I wanted the book to do, to concentrate on the murder, the evil behind Harvey and really solving the crime (rather than taking over Ruth's body and having sex with Ray -- which the movie does anyway!  Seriously, why doesn't Susie say who her murderer is rather than take over Ruth's body to get a kiss??  Oh brother).<br /><br />[End Spoiler]<br /><br />The whole touchy-feely stuff with the former victims all  happy in the Blue Horizon with Susie was something out of the Sixties, all the moody music and harp music, didn't do much for the story nor for me.  Happy and beautiful rape & murder victims?  Nah....<br /><br />I do enjoy Jackson's way with making the slightest motion increase abnormally or making scenes unusually bright or dark pitch to represent mood and "flavor" of the film.  Occasional tense moments such as Susie's sister sneaking into Harvey's house to get evidence of her sister's murder is intense and has you on your seat's edge!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film.  Certainly not Peter Jackson's best, but as book adaptations go, not too bad.  The book suffered from too much secondary characterization and padding and Jackson cut all that out.  The ending he kept (unfortunately).  The "In Between" Blue Horizon of the spirit world was a bit too happy and light considering it was made up of murder and rape victims!<br /><br />Recommended for those who've read the book.  And the Sixties guitar ballads are tolerable!<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Directed by<br />Peter Jackson<br /><br />Writing credits<br />(WGA)<br />Fran Walsh  (screenplay) &<br />Philippa Boyens  (screenplay) &<br />Peter Jackson  (screenplay)<br /><br />Alice Sebold  (novel)<br />Cast (in credits order)<br /><br /> Mark Wahlberg Jack Salmon<br /> Rachel Weisz ...

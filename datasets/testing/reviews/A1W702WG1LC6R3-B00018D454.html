<meta name="summary" content=""Good Remake!""></head><body><p>Jessica Biel, R. Lee Ermey and Andrew Bryniarski star in this 2003<br />horror remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 film. A group of teens are<br />hunted by a killer and his psychotic cannibalistic family. This<br />is one of the few remakes that's as good as the original and<br />Ermey and Bryniarski are great in it. This 2-disc set has nice<br />picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.</p></body></html>

This time Pixar releases another hit, Incredibles, which brings an important social issue to the silver screen for the whole family to enjoy in witty, fast-paced, animated action comedy.<br /><br />Socially acceptable tendencies usually encourage people to behave in a manner of conformity, as negative responses from the community could possibly harm the individual if the individual does not conform.  Assimilation is the process adjusting with conformity to new information or situations.  This means that a person who changes his or her own unique identity does so in order to fit in with the majority.  On occasion, the majority forcefully pushes their values on the minority, which forces the small group to assimilate to the standards of the majority.  In essence, assimilation can be far worse than persecution, as the individual's identity could be erased to nothingness.  Incredibles applies this notion to superheroes, as they are forced to go into hiding and conceal their natural superhuman abilities.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has superhuman strength that he uses to save people and prevent crimes.  However, Mr. Incredible's superhuman strength gets him into trouble when he saves a person who tries to commit suicide.  It leads him and other superheroes into persecution, which forces them to assimilate into the society.  Mr. Incredible assumes his true identity, Bob Parr, a very unhappy insurance agent, without ever returning to the life of being a superhero.<br /><br />Some fifteen years later Bob still drives a small car back and forth from his job and home in a suburban neighborhood where all homes look identical.  At home his wife, Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), formerly known as Elastigirl, maintains the home as a homemaker, which includes raising three children.  Bob and Helen's children have also acquired superhuman powers, which they are not allowed to use since it could bring them trouble.  Nonetheless, it happens that they use their powers to get into mischief and other troubles at home.<br /><br />Bob breaks the monotony in life by hanging out with Lucius Best (Samuel L. Jackson) who used to be the superhero Frozone.  Together these two ex-superheroes sit and listen to the police radio, while occasionally acting on a distress signal without consideration for the consequences.  Helen finds out about Bob's nightly adventures and tells him to stop as it could bring more danger to the family.<br /><br />Out of the blue a woman approaches Bob and informs him that his special talent is needed.  Again without thinking things through Bob turns into Mr. Incredible, as he wants to do something to feel alive again and not feel trapped in the suburban tomb for the living dead.  This time the danger seems to be more dubious and more dangerous than what he has ever before encountered and he might need some extra help in order to defeat the evil that is coming his way through the villain Syndrome.<br /><br />The filmmakers at Pixar bring the audience a terrific cinematic experience through superheroes that are forced into hiding.  Incredibles deals with several issues besides assimilation such as coming of age, love, parenting, and much more.  These issues are brought to the audience through drama, humor, and suspense, which are depicted through some remarkable computer animation.  The film gives the audience an opportunity to burst out laughing and bite their nails in suspense while leaving the audience with an entertaining experience that will leave some pondering about the issues presented in the film.</p></body></html>

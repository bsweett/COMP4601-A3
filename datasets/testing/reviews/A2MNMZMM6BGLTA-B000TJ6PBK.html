<meta name="summary" content="Old School Horror"></head><body><p>I thought this was an ok movie. It is a classic ghost story/horror movie done with todays special effects. I thought it was pretty good but I must say, this is not my genre and I have never been a real fan of this type of movie or any horror movie for that matter. My friends really enjoyed it and if you like classic horror, ghost stories or scares of that nature you probably will find it to be a good one. I thought it was good but nothing I haven't seen from the old Hammer days with Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Boris Karloff.</p></body></html>

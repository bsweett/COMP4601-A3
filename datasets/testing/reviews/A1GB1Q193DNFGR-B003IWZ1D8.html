Before Psycho, Hollywood was in the dying days  of the age of sentiment. Hollywood produced pictures that were sentimenal,  emotional, and concerned about showcasing the human condition. Psycho with  the savagry of Mother Bates butcher knife hacked through Hollywood  sentiment and created the age of sensation. 60's movies such as Bonnie and  Clyde, the Birds, Rosemary's Baby, Midnight Cowboy, Butch Cassady and the  Sundance Kid, and the Wild Bunch are among many examples of how sixties  filmmakers became liberated due to Hichcock's magnificant diffance of  convential film guidelines with Psycho. As for the film's structure,  musical accompaniment, direction, film editing, and acting performances,  the film masterfully excels at all levels and is one of the important films  in the last 100 years. The grandaddy of the modern horror movie and the  inspiration for modern screen violence, Psycho is still a one of a kind  Hitchcock masterwork. The DVD is exemplemary edition to your DVD or video  collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Want Lex Luthor's Boat"></head><body><p>I thought the original Christopher Reeve movie had its moments, but reversing time was just too stupid for me to take it seriously. I didn't watch the Salkinds finish killing the franchise, although I did read about the destruction on the Agony Booth website, where they treat me like kryptonite. And as a child, I thought the comics were just stupid. Thus, I was hesitant to see this. But one of my Chinese students, whose English name is Bruce Wayne, said he preferred it to BATMAN BEGINS. I love BATMAN BEGINS. So even though Bruce Wayne's loose lips gave me one of the big plot spoilers, I decided I oughta watch it anyway. Then, in Thailand, Jan gave my DVD to a student before I had the chance. No matter. I found another last week.<br /><br />Superman has always required a willing suspension of disbelief that's been difficult for me to pull off. The flaws in his secret identity really come to light when Superman and Clark Kent both return from five-year absences, and look much alike, and nobody notices.<br /><br />His supersuit is never harmed by the stresses of his lifestyle but yields to Martha Kent's scissors, needle and thread. It's creepy watching him spy on people with super-hearing and X-ray vision, not for some "greater good" that he has no right to judge, but rather to sort out his love life. Being invincible is boring, kryptonite is contrived, and why were doctors giving him oxygen when he flies through space and apparently doesn't need to breathe?<br /><br />But Lex Luthor finally makes sense to me. I love his boat.<br /><br />On the whole, a fresh approach, a good reimagining of the Superman concept, and a watchable movie. But I won't be rushing out looking for any sequels.</p></body></html>

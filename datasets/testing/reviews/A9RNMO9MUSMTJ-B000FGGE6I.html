<meta name="summary" content="worth looking at..."></head><body><p>Kind of a eye candy movie, with pretty good action associated<br /><br /> with the main character.  Just like a comic book the fights are<br /><br />pretty unbelievable....but because the camera angles and the direction<br /><br />is pretty good, it gives the movie a boost.<br /><br />In line with Aeron Flux, but better than Bloodrayne ...except for the<br /><br />blood and guts department in which Bloodrayne rules.<br /><br />So yes, definitively is worth a showing or two. Get it second hand.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good special effects, terrible script"></head><body><p>The government develops a cure for the mutant gene, which divides the mutant community with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) on one side and Magneto (Ian McKellan) on the other, each backed by their respective armies.  What's good about it?  There are tons of mutants expertly realized through spectacular special effects.  It's great fun to see Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), and others in action.  What's bad about it?  There are tons of mutants, which means that none of the characters are well-developed.  The script is a complete mess, killing off important, classic, well-established characters in off-handed ways as if they were red-shirted security men on "Star Trek."  So it's fun to watch, but a deeply disappointing finale to an otherwise good series.</p></body></html>

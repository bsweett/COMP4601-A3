<meta name="summary" content="Alien 3"></head><body><p>Director:  David Fincher<br />Cast:  Sigourney Weaver, Charles Dutton, Charles Dance, Paul McGann, Brian Glover.<br />Running Time:  115 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<p>While it is unfair to expect any of the &quot;Alien&quot; sequels to equal the originality of the 1979 tale and the explosiveness of the 1986 follow-up &quot;Aliens&quot;, this third installment is a bitter disappointment.  Director David Fincher, known for making excellent cinematic experiences with lavish special effects and intense cuts does create a visually stunning picture, but does not have the ensemble cast or the script to produce and effective, intelligent, and respectable science fiction thriller.<p>Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands on an all-but-deserted penal colony that is used for housing madmen, murderers, and rapists.  The acid-spitting, flesh-eating alien creature has, unfortunately (for Ripley, the crew, and entire viewing audience of this poor sequel), hitches a ride with our heroine and again the battle against extra-terrestrial evil continues.  Weaver is once again very good as the tough, charismatic Ripley, but she is not supported well by the cast.  She was extremely lucky to have great colleagues in &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;, but &quot;Alien 3&quot; proves that her luck has run out.  Dark, uninspiring, and an overall mess.  Loyal fans of the series will enjoy, but this film should not expect too many darkhorse followers--stick with the first two.</p></body></html>

This not usually my type of movie, the huge success of it was a clear consequence of all the propaganda and publicity surrounding it (which by the way is included as bonus material in this DVD release), I was a little reluctant to watch it at the movie theaters and I waited to watch it on DVD.<br /><br />Man I loved this film, the "innocence" of the character may be funny to a lot of people, but that is precisely what Sacha Baron Cohen used as a mean to get the worst of the people interacting with him, by provoking everyone surrounding him while pretending to be an innocent character from Kazakhstan, many of the more bizarre lines in this film come from the people around him and not Borat himself. This of course generated a lot of legal problems when the film was released that did nothing but give the movie more publicity than the one it already had.<br /><br />I still find it hard to believe he was able to leave the rodeo after insulting all the people in the place, there are lots of situations in which Borat does nothing but set the situation for people to show what they really think or believe (a police officer tells him to be ready to be stopped in his van lots of times because of his appearance, when Borat asks why, the officer simply replies "that's the way it is in America")<br /><br />I am not saying of course this is a serious film, it can be outrageous, disgusting, but funny in the end. This release contains deleted material that I believe could have been better that some things that were left in the film (check out the employee at the convenience store when he tries to explain that in America there can be many different types of cheese and also see Borat trying to buy a dog to have "sexy time" and then eat it)<br /><br />It also includes a section for "Global Propaganda" that contains interviews with Connan O Brien, Saturday night Live and Jay Leno with Martha Stewart (my personal favorite) It is also funny to see the way Borat thanks Michael Moore at a film festival when he tries to thank him. Another bonus material to be found is the bizarre music infomercial (advertising the music from Kazakhstan) released on the web to promote the film.<br /><br />Again, this may not be my regular type of film but it sure had me laughing, it is a film that beyond the jokes it might leave you with a couple things to think about.</p></body></html>

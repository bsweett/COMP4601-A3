<meta name="summary" content="High noon at the supermarket"></head><body><p>Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is an exceptional and very gung-ho London police officer. He's earned nine commendations within the past year alone. He owns the highest arrest record, and has been wounded three times in the line of duty. And he's making everyone else on the metropolitan police force look bad. Rampant resentment in the work room leads to Sgt. Angel's reassignment to the cheery, rustic village of Sandford.<br /><br />To an intense cop who can't let go of the job, Sandford is a living hell in which nothing much happens, and it happens all the time. But looks can be deceiving, first impressions are sometimes wonky. In the friendly confines of Sanford hides a murderous conspiracy, and it isn't too long before our newest town bobby catches a whiff of the shady. It begins with a series of grisly accidents...<br /><br />It's a delicate balance, what these guys come up with, and it's fantastic to see the mad geniuses behind SHAUN OF THE DEAD marvelously live up to expectations with HOT FUZZ. The whole thing could have easily tumbled like a house of cards, but the writers and the director and the actors - especially the awesomely deadpan Simon Pegg - play it straight, which adds resonance to the story, makes the comedy bits so much the better. It helps, too, that there's this edgy flavor to the action sequences, an intensity to the chases and the gun battles and to Angel's run-ins with the killer in that black hood cloak robe thingee.<br /><br />Pegg and Nick Frost - who plays Angel's bumbling partner in this picture - continue that most excellent buddy chemistry they had going on in SHAUN OF THE DEAD and even in the British television comedy SPACED. In a neat twist, Pegg abandons his patented sad nerd persona for that of an unflappable, unstoppable supercop. Meanwhile, ex-007 Timothy Dalton comes in as the diabolical villain of the piece. I like these topsy-turvies.<br /><br />You can appreciate HOT FUZZ either as a rollicking send-up of buddy cop pictures or as an action thriller in its own right, or even as both. The film earns its slickness via its rapid-fire edits and ungodly loud special effects, especially when it arrives at the final act as our hot fuzz and a cadre of heavily armed perps shoot it out in the quiet streets of Sandford and then in the supermarket aisles. There is also a swan. It's that kind of movie.</p></body></html>

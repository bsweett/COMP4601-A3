<meta name="summary" content="James Brooks Brings Life to an Old Nag"></head><body><p>Back when Homer was a wee lad some thousands of years ago, he heard the then ancient story of the grouchy old man whose life is turned around by a beautiful young women. He built it into one of his many monologues so that ultimately it moved from the oral to the written tradition in what we think of as Ancient Greece. Since that time story tellers have repeated the tale with many variations, but it remains basically the same: Love Conquers All. Having plenty of cash available, Brooks and his backers were willing to insure success by giving a great deal of it to Jack Nicholson and lesser amounts to his co-stars and the remainder of the cast. The result: a first rate romantic comedy likely to make its two hours and twenty minutes seem but a few minutes of pleasure. Nicholas as the Grouch and Kinnear as his gay neighbor, play their roles as if they were made for them (as they were); Hunt, as the girl in the story, manifests some of her characteristic acting oddities, but, on the whole, holds her own. This is a good one likely to entertain most people</p></body></html>

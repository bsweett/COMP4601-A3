Being a millionaire and following some strange and monumental ideas is not that important! The Aviator is only a movie with brilliant special effects only for entertainment but this movie has concept! and It's really a Defectless movie. It makes you think about the concept of life. for old people, old for certain jobs I mean, for example for being a Pianist, 20 years age is considered old. This movie for any old people for certain jobs has a message that even as an old man and woman, everyone can get his or her shot anytime. Everything is possible with love and hard work both!<br /><br />and this movie may could not make you weep, although I'm sure many people weep at the last hour of movie. but, Difinately it makes you think.<br /><br />I'm not religious but I heard from some religious people that the punishment is in this world not in everlasting life. They say be kind with you mother, be good with others and similar words. the question is, What wrong had she done for receiving that kind of punishment. she was a good apprantice for her mentor, good daughter for her mother, good sister for her family and nice with others. something seems wrong here. at least at religious point of view. most of american people are religious so I'm sure that's the question of many people. That's very important cause when a kid or a young person who's grown up with religious believes, see this movie, It's highly possible to say to himself or herself, hey, she was nice to everyone. look at her salvation. so what's the benefit of being nice? Fear of GOD that may punish me for being nice? then let's not be nice! and that's not a good lesson. I think Clint Eastwood had to write more accurate scenario. anyway that's not a real problem!</p></body></html>

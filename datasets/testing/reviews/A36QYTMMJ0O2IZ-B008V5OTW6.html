<meta name="summary" content="Compelling Story of Vengeance...Which Never Ends"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg scores again.  One might initially look at this film as an advocacy for revenge.  It isn't.<br /><br />The story takes place after "Black September" in which Israeli hostages were killed during the Munich Olympic games.  It is about an elite team of Israeli assassins who are charged with finding the masterminds behind Black September and eliminating them.  It is a story about revenge.<br /><br />Eric Bana delivers a powerful performance as Avner, an Israeli man who appears to be enjoying the life he is living with his young wife who is pregnant with their child.  Avner is recruited and asked to perform a difficult task for the sake of the country of Israel.<br /><br />Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is the Israeli who is in charge of making sure that Avner is able to carry out his duty as well as providing him with four other men as well as unlimited funds to acquire the necessary intelligence concerning the whereabouts of the men they're supposed to kill.<br /><br />Avner finds, initially, that the first couple of targets are difficult to carry out for him, especially emotionally.  He all but panics when he realizes that the young daughter of one of his targets has gone back inside the apartment (since they've agreed not to kill civilians).<br /><br />At first it seems that Avner and his team are having no trouble finding and eliminating their targets thanks to the help of Louis (Mathieu Almaric) and his father (Michael Lonsdale).  But then, one of the members of his own team is found dead in the bed of a woman who has obviously been hired to kill him.  Avner quickly realizes that the hunters have quickly become the hunted.  One by one members of his team are killed.  At first this compells him to kill those responsible as well as the men responsible for Black Sunday.<br /><br />Avner soon reaches a state of paranoia and distrust.  He doesn't know if Louis and his father have sold him out.  He doesn't know if the Israeli government may be behind it as well.  He soon finds himself sleeping the closet of his hotel room and longing to return to his wife and daughter who are living in New York.<br /><br />Avner concludes that the killing can never stop.  He finally understands that he, himself, will never be rid of the fear that he might be killed some day as well.  He realizes that vengeance only begets more vengeance.  Ephraim all but acknowledges this, even though he tries to reassure Avner of the "great work" he's done for his country.  Avner can no longer view it in these terms, as he doesn't even feel it is safe to return to Israel.<br /><br />One of the most compelling shots in this film is at the very end.  As I stated earlier, this film is about the dangers and sickness of "vengeance."  Spielberg ends the film with a shot of the two towers of the World Trade Center.  In his own way, he is stating that no amount of vengeance is justifiable.  Because, where does it end?  Avner realizes that for every person he's killed, more have risen to take their places.  In his heart, he understands that it causes only pain, and mostly to himself.<br /><br />Munich is a powerful, important film, which says a lot about the world we live in...because it doesn't have to be that way.</p></body></html>

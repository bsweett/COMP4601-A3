<meta name="summary" content="Well-told But Flawed Story about "A Beautiful Mind""></head><body><p>Writing a biography is always a tricky thing, causing debates over accuracy.  When some say this guy is a genius, others say he's just a lucky fellow.  And if the person in point is still alive, the case gets more complicated.  So, script writer Akiva Goldsman did something very unique in creating lifestory of John Nash, Nobel-Prize winning mathematician.  <p>Russel Crowe plays this real-life Princeton professor John Nash, whose gifted "beautiful mind" leads his heart to the places where no ordinary persons can imagine to go.  Full of youth, confidence, and a little bit of arrogance, John is finally recruited by America's prestigeous institute, after writing a paper that later greatly influence the theories in economics and other academic fields.  Soon he finds his love in one of his students, and his life seems going smoothly until one gentleman came to him, asking to crack the secret codes from Russia.<p>First, don't try to find anything authentic about Mr. Nashs life; the film is as real as those secret organizations depicted in 007 series.  The director Ron Howard and the writer Goldsman shows the "essence" of his suffering from schizophonia, which is to stay with John Nash from his youth until his age got advanced much later.  Here's the trick of the film (you must see it for yourself), which may leave some viewers embarrassed.  I know some critics who in effect claimed, with some justfication, that this film doesn't pay enough respect to patients of this disease, and I am not perfectly sure how to refute these detractors' claims.<p>The film has, let me assure you, been endowed with power coming from the leading actor Crowe, whose utter failure of "Proof of Life" should be now forgiven and forgotten.  Nash's delicate sensibility is expressed with his gifted performance, and very subtle nuance is conveyed with well-timed lines that suggest his fragile inner feelings (see, for instance, when he is beaten by one of his friends over the GO game, how he mutters with hurt pride: "This games is flawed.")  But it is not fair if he takes all the credits; look the superb job of his special make-up done by wizard Greg Cannom, whose previous work includes "Mrs. Doubtfire" and many, many others.  Remember his name, too.<p>The film ends, I am afraid, not with traditional happy-ending catharsis.  After so long painful years, he is given a Nobel Prize for what he had done long time ago, of which existence, most incredibly, he totally had forgotten.  It looks like a birthday present delivered too late, and you should be reminded one small fact of life: youth is easily lost when you really need it.  <p>Finally, if you ask me this film deserves Oscar, I would answer, considering the line-ups of other contenders of the year 2002, "Yes."  But it is also true (and I hope you think the same way) Ron Howard made better films in the past.  If he is given Oscar, he should have been given one for "Cocoon" or "Apollo 13."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="JUAN CARLOS FRESNADILLO, OPUS 2"></head><body><p>***** 2007. Co-written and directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. The rage outbreak is once again not far away when the search for a vaccine brings a seemingly immune subject into the headquarters of the American forces. Forget all the George Romero's zombies films and all the werewolves flicks, 28 WEEKS LATER is a masterpiece. The spanish director who already gave us a first rate film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJBU">Intacto</a> in 2001 proves here he's a director one will have to count with very soon. The description of a devastated London and of the relations between the members of a devastated family are a pure cinematic delight. Science fiction at its best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Kind Of Movie That Reminds Us How Great It Is To Have Eyes"></head><body><p>It's almost impossible to throw too much praise on The Watchmen. It is one of the 100 best films ever made and the greatest page to screen adaptation done in this century. It's a film for people who enjoy the art of making a great motion picture, it is a pleasure to behold, seeing it is a plain and simple awesome experience. It is also one of those rare examples of a movie actually being better than its original source material, which in itself was a brilliant act of innovation. All that said, The Watchmen also has some nice blue penis shots, and it's hard to go wrong with blue penis scenes. Seriously, though, if there is anything better than seeing The Watchmen for the first time in the big screen, it's seeing it for the first time on Blu-ray. Absolutely and unreservedly recommended to all. A bargain at many times the asking price. If you want to go to Heaven when you die, you'd better buy The Watchmen now, because the end of the world is coming and I hear it's God's favorite flick!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's not a sequel!"></head><body><p>This film has nothing in common with its predecessor &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; except that Anthony Hopkins once again plays Hannibal Lecter with that same witty and delicious sense of cunning and all out swarm and overt sex appeal. This paints a much more even film thatn its &quot;Silence...&quot;, where as in that film the whole atmosphere was swamped in a sort of thick unbearable nightmare.  This film is more visually driven giving the viewer a rush with the eyes instead of with the mind. The director Ridley Scott does what James Cameron did with Aliens after Scott filmed the original. Scott uses the films score and dark pallette to give the viewer a sense of displacement in the key scenes of the film. The story is quite simple lecter escapes his to new lands where we find a troubled Starling (Moore) who must put him back behind bars. The film has a perverse game of cat and mouse between Starling and Lecter that has them at key scenes being each others worst nightmares and at others being their saviors! Interms of sheer viewer involvement this film more than out does the original. Just watch the criss cross between columns and rained soaked cobbled streets as a niave pickpocket goes after Lecter only to be done away with. The story is dark, witty, gruesome, sexy and visually spectacular and does more than a great job of holding its own in cinema. If one is looking for the mind games and claustrophobic ambience of &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; than watch that fillm instead.</p></body></html>

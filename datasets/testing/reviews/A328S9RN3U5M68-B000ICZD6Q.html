<meta name="summary" content="'Synergy': All components unite in this comedy of reality"></head><body><p>Hats off to Paul Weitz!  Who would have thought that the person behind 'American Pie', 'Nutty Professor II', 'Antz' etc could write and direct a film so intelligent and sensitive and genuinely funny in the most sophisticated sense of the word 'comedy'?  But pause; 'About a Boy' is also to his credit, so perhaps the other ventures were just exploratory surgeries which allowed him to find his particular voice and view of life today!<br /><br />IN GOOD COMPANY  deals with many issues, not the least of which is the current conflicted status of the Baby Boomers.  In our increasingly youth oriented culture, the generation now in their late forties and fifties is struggling to maintain a niche and identity that allows them to continue pursuing the American Dream as the X Generation of instant gratification young ones step on experienced hands on the ever-lengthening ladder to success.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid), approaching age 52, is a laid back ad salesman for a successful sports magazine that allows him time and money to enjoy his two beautiful daughters Alex (Scarlett Johansson) and Jana (Zena Gray) and his ideal wife Ann (Marg Helgenberger).  Enter Mergers and Acquisitions - that increasingly dreadful and greedy term that we banter around between fears of concerns over job loss and acknowledgement of Corporate abuse in out-sourcing, executive wealth plus greed, etc.  A new media company buys Dan's magazine and in downsizing the staff to increase corporate profits, Dan is replaced by one Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a 26 year old kid whose only claim to experience is a ridiculous line of dinosaur cell phones to court the 'under 5 year old' market!<br /><br />Dan's life seems to be crumbling and to add to his disillusionment he discovers a pregnancy test kit in his bathroom wastebasket, immediately implicates his lovely 18-year-old daughter Alex, only to hear that his wife is indeed the pregnant one.  The threat of bills for Alex seeking to attend NYU, his demotion, and the impending new baby plague his psyche, and his once secure life seems to be in the hands of his new boss, Carter.<br /><br />Carter starts his new terrifying Corporate Executive job with a surprise divorce, meets Alex early on, eventually falls in love with her, hides his newly treasured relationship from Dan, fires many of Dan's loyal company, and in general unwittingly sets himself up as Dan's nemesis, all the while idolizing Dan for his abilities, his character, his family life, his home in the suburbs,...as well as his daughter.  How all of these elements resolve is a fast-paced comedy/tragedy that results in a large dollop of self-introspection and realignment for all of the characters in this life drama.  No happy-wappy Hollywood finale here, but instead a series of tender lessons learned.<br /><br />The brilliance of Weitz' superb script and direction are ably abetted by standout performances by Topher Grace, Dennis Quaid, and Scarlett Johansson.  Watching them at their craft is sheer pleasure.  This film takes 'comedy' to new heights and it has so much to say about current personal vs corporate status that it should be required viewing.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, January 2005</p></body></html>

I've seen this movie several times and continue to be amazed and the plot and visual look of the movie. Wow. I keep finding new subtle things in the movie overlooked in my first viewing. This movie is the starter for a 3 movie collection. Telling some of the history and moving forward with this story. Underworld and Underworld Evolution move the story further in time while the third movie tells the history of how we got here.<br /><br />The story is about two races of beings, the upper class Vampires and the worker class Werewolves. In the old times, the races lived together in harmony, now they are at war. This story focuses on "a human" who we later learn has characteristics of both races and his blood is valuable to both races. Of course, our lead character (Kate Beckinsale) needs the help of a sleeping vampire lord. A very impressive movie with stunning visual look. Once you finish Underworld, keep on going with Evolution and Rise of the Lycans. Highly recommended and added to my list of favorite movies.</p></body></html>

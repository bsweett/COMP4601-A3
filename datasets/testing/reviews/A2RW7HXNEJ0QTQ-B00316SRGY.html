<meta name="summary" content="Why couldnt it have been: The blown 1967 RS SS CAMARO!"></head><body><p>Ok so the car ..uh kinda cool... but come on .. could have been better.. but the story was very strong. Eastwood is brilliant when it comes to storyline and direction. He is a tough old man that is very prejudice.. it is his struggle to deal with his prejudice in the face of serious injustice. Justice is served in classic Eastwood fashion... I only took 1 star away for the choice of his vehicle and some poor acting with some of the cast..lol but he ties why this car is his baby.. another great Eastwood film.</p></body></html>

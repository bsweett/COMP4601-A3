They finally lightened up the backgrounds so you can see, and not a giant black mess. This disc includes the 2003 directors cut, the additional scenes are a bonus, somewhat. Alien and Aliens on Blu-ray are THE copies to own, beautiful work. And no I do not include Alien3, Alien4, and AVP as worth owning on my list.</p></body></html>

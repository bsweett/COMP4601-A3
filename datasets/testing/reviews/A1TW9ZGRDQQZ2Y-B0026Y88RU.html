<meta name="summary" content="A great cast and a fun flick, but some of the dialogue is lacking"></head><body><p>This movie boasts one of the most impressive casts of actors in recent memory. You got the heavyweights in Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, the middleweight in Bruce Willis, and the lightweights in Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu. They are all very good in playing these weird and quirky characters. The scene with Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley at the end is reminiscent of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro meeting face to face for the first time in Heat. Though this scene isn't quite as good, it is still some cool stuff.<br /><br />The dialogue is the only thing I didn't enjoy as I much as I had hoped. Some of it was good, but too much tried to be a Quentin Tarantino clone of sorts. I also had a problem with the fact that the ending explained everything down to the last detail. I prefer a movie that tells you what happened, but still leaves a little room for your own ideas.<br /><br />All in all, the movie was fun, inventive, had memorable characters, and you can't go wrong with the actors here. Even Josh Hartnett was good, especially as the film progressed, and Lucy Liu really  brought life into the picture and was a cutie to boot. Bruce did his silent hitman thing well, complete with an icy stare. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both ham it up in a good way, and they are fun to watch.<br /><br />Lucky Number Slevin may have an awkward title leaving people to be confused more than wanting to see the film, but it was a fun ride for me and I hope it finds its audience.</p></body></html>

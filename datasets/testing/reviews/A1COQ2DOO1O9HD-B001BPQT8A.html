<meta name="summary" content="Criterion could not have done better"></head><body><p>The Se7en New Line Platinum Series edition is a high-water mark in the release of modern film classics, and puts some recent Criterion releases to shame.  This is a film that deserved a thoughtful release, and it got it.<p>Se7en is a film that works perfectly despite (or rather, because of) the formulaic set-up: rookie homicide detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is paired with a crusty old veteran, detective Sommerset (Morgan Freemen), who is in his last days before retirement.  This, of course, is exactly when a Brilliant Serial Killer With a Diabolical Plan decides to commit a series of ghastly murders.  Naturally, films in this genre need to have a &quot;hook&quot;, a conceit that gives the murders a possibly predictable pattern.  This way our intrepid detectives can engage the killer in a battle of wits, a Race Against Time to save lives before the Master Plan is completed.  In this case, the title says it all - the serial killer is patterning his crimes after the seven deadly sins.<p>But here is where Se7en veers off course, and, in the process, becomes a real masterpiece of the genre. This familiar, well-worn surface is a deception. Se7en wants you to relax, thinking you know the territory, and then pull the proverbial rug out. I won't tell you what happens or who the serial killer turns out to be (just in case you are one of the few people on Earth who doesn't know by now), but even if you figure it all out beforehand, it won't do you any good.  You will still sweat.  You will still squirm.  You will still peek through your fingers - which is a shame, since the feature on DVD #1 was transferred from the original camera negative under the supervision of director David Fincher.  In the commentary track, Fincher himself says that this is probably the best that Se7en has ever looked.<p>When you uncover your eyes again, you can then get lost for many hours in the formidable collection of supplemental material on DVD #2.  Most fascinating is a detailed look at the creation of the prop journals featured in the serial killer's lair.  It is not often that we stop to consider that someone actually has to create the stuff we see on screen, and that they often labor for weeks to get something just right - only to have it handled for a few moments by an actor and then discarded.<p>In all, the Se7en New Line Platinum Series edition is a valuable addition to any serious film collection.</p></body></html>

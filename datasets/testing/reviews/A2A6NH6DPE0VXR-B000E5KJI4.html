I don't see where it's that bad at all though. Brad Pitt looks better in the part of his character than Colin Farrel does in Alexandre. He's no Russel Crowe in Gladiator but still I think he does fine in the part. It's just hard to root for his character though because he's clearly fighting for the wrong team. He just wants to go down in history as a great warrior pretty much so can really careless who he's fighting.  He has no real desire to fight in a war that's mostly over a women but he is in it just for the victory and fame and...his ego. He changes a little but still he still chooses to fight on the wrong side and to kill nice innocent people.<br /><br />  The trailers make Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down) look bad and  Brad Pitt's character look like this great hero but really it's the other way around. Eric Bana plays this passionate guy who's just really fighting to defend his family and Kingdom. Pitt is just fighting for him and the glory eventhough he does have a heart in there somewhere. He never gets you to care for him as much as you do for Russel Crowe in Gladiator.  Bana even makes your care for him more and is a lot more likeable than Pitt is.<br /><br />  The supporting cast is fantastic too, Brian Coxx  (X-Men 2, Manhunter) plays a crazed leader who wants to just conquare Troy. He doesn't care that his brother's wife left him for the prince of Troy and isn't fighting because of that. Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) is fine as the Prince of Troy who's love is too strong for Helen to allow her to go back to avoid war. Peter O'Toole is also excellent as the King of Troy who just wanted peace. He shows he can still act and I think he should even be nominated for Best Supporting actor. Sean Bean (The Lord of the Rings) is also good in a small role as Pitt's friend who gets him to go into battle with him. Movies like this always show that he deserves better than to be always casted as a villain from  Ireland in bad movies. The movie is  very involving with great sword-play and intense battles. Just have to be able to sit through good people getting killed a lot and the movie dragging on a little.</p></body></html>

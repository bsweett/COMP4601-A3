<meta name="summary" content="The Chinese Matrix Is Now In Blu!"></head><body><p>I've always been a fan of Stephen Chow and his uniquely quirky sense of humour and I had watched his earlier films like the "God of Cookery" for example and his secret agent spoof but his films always seemed to start and develop well but to always have lame endings in addition to being rather shallow and one-dimensional at times.  That is until this great film which balances the same comedy with a very good story of redemption and of how two "losers" finally make it good.<br /><br />In "Kung Fu Hustle" we finally get a very good Stephen Chow ending which never fails to bring a tear to my eye each time I watch it.  This is why this film has now become my favourite movie of his and this Blu-ray release doesn't disappoint.  The picture and sound quality is very good and has to be watched in the original Cantonese with English subtitles if necessary to truly appreciate this.  The special features are really nothing to crow about if you are into these extras but for me I'm not too fussed about these and the interview for instance was quite pathetic here with the condescending tone and stupid questions of the interviewer clearly frustrating Stephen Chow who looks like he'd rather be having a root canal than to have to endure it.<br /><br />As for the movie itself it was the usual brand of Stephen Chow comedy where he intersperses spoofs of various western movies with madcap/slapstick comedy and we clearly get allusions to "The Matrix" even to the point of him being called "the One" like Neo at the end when he finally achieves his full potential.  We even get a spoof of Kubrick's "The Shining" in one scene when he helps the Beast to escape not to mention the reference to the Roadrunner cartoons when he is running away from the landlady etc.  What makes this rise above the usual Stephen Chow outing is the great other story within the story with the flashbacks explaining why the Chow character behaves the way he does as an adult and how he finally finds redemption.<br /><br />This is an excellent Stephen Chow film and it is in my opinion his best to date and this blu-ray version is a real treat with its excellent picture and sound quality when viewed in the original language.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Review of film and blu ray version"></head><body><p>I must admit most of this review will be based on my second viewing of this film.  Both viewings were on blu ray but the first time I had high expectations.  The story line intrigued me and I am a huge Shia LaBeouf fan.  With the first viewing I didn't like it very much.  I liked Shia but I thought the story line pushed the limits and was just too unbelievable for me.  It looked great in blu ray but I was disappointed.<br /><br />Well, we all know that our experiences when we have expectations can sometimes be altered.  I love blu ray, have consistently read how EAGLE EYE is one of the best films to utilize blu ray to its full effect so now, many months after my first viewing I purchased EAGLE EYE.  I wanted to have it for I do want to own every Shia LaBeouf film and I am so grateful I did.  This time I sat back with my home theater system with no expectations and was on the edge of my seat from beginnig to end.  Knowing the plot and having no expectations allowed me to just view it and amazingly the plot suddendlty made sense, caught me up from beginning to end and I enjoyed myself immensely.<br /><br />Kudos first must go to the acting.  Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan and Billy Bob Thornton all up the ante with their acting chops.  These characters are believable and it is refreshing to have the male and female lead not get romantically involved.  It brings more of a sense of relity to the film.  This film is directed and acted with respect to the story and it is very believable once you get caught up.  It is also filled with amazing action sequences and they were all right - blu ray is the only real way to enjoy this film to is full effect.  The video presentation is an amazingly crisp 1080p.  Colors and clarity are perfection.  Flesh tones are just right and the quality does not falter be it day or night, inside or outside.  The video never falters throughout the amazing action sequences.  The audio is an amazing Dolby TruHD 5.1.  Whether with dialogue driven scenes or the major action driven scenes the audio is strong, vibrant and realistic.  All the speakers of your theatre system will be put to use and the sound quality throughout is at such a level that it makes the film that much more stimulating.<br /><br />This is the first time I have ever said that if you did not like a film the first time give it a second shot but EAGLE EYE is an action film of the highest caliber with stimulating suspense.  Certainly one I plan on viewing again and again.  Highly recommend.</p></body></html>

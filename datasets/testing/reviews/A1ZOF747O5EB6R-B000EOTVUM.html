<meta name="summary" content="A True Horror Film Worth Seeing"></head><body><p>Let there be no mistake, "Wolf Creek" is of the true crime genre.  It is not a movie for the faint hearted.  Reasonably explicit acts of violence are part of the story.<br /><br />"Wolf Creek" is said to be based on a true story.  This may be stretching the truth a bit.  There are probably two cases which are points of reference.  The first is the so-called back packer murderer, Ivan Milat, who is currently doing a life term in a high security prison near Sydney.  The second is the Peter Falconio case where the man in question has gone missing presumed murdered with a defendant currently in the dock.  Both cases were particularly gruesome.<br /><br />John Jarrett plays the murderer in "Wolf Creek" and he personifies evil.  He is a serial killer who shows neither remorse nor any sign of slowing down.  His technique is generally the same.  He acts to assist travellers who have broken down in the outback before drugging them and then moving on to rape and murder.  For many people, travel in the outback will never be the same after watching this film.<br /><br />Regardless, the film is well worth watching.  The plot is plausible as are the characters.  However, as already mentioned, the scenes are violent and upsetting.  If such violence takes you beyond your comfort zone, avoid the film.  Walking out in disgust, as same patrons have done, is little more than a display of ignorance.</p></body></html>

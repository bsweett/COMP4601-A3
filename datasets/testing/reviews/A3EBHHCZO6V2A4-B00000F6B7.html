It outshines its predecessor with its galactic adventure, and an ancient feud. Adm. Kirk learns his ex-wife (or ex-girlfriend? It's not clear) and their son David are making the Genesis device, capable of making new life. It terraforms. There's some family drama. Kirk's ex is still angry about her abandonment; David is a wimpy mama's boy. What threatens to become As the Galaxy Turns becomes adventurous when Khan Noonien Singh (a wonderfully villainous Ricardo Montalban) is awakened. Khan is a genetically engineered superman; will he finally have his revenge on Kirk?<br /><br />"Wrath of Khan" has some powerful moments- from Montalban as the stylish villain to the spectacular worldmaking powers of the Genesis device. Khan sticks a particularly gross worm into Chekov's ear (you don't SEE anything,but the implications are hideous enough) Mr. Spock sacrifices his life for the crew.<br /><br />"Wrath of Khan" is one of the superior Star Trek films. It wasn't sequelitis! It's an enjoyable popcorn flick.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban was a great actor and gentleman. He will be missed as a luminary on the stage and screen.

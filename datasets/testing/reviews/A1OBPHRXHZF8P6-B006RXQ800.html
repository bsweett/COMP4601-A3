<meta name="summary" content="Stop the presses...Dicaprio does a movie I actually like !!!"></head><body><p>Still reeling from his past projects of teeny-bopper fame (Titanic) I initially cringed at the thought of voluntarily watching something with Leonardo Dicaprio in it. Unless you are a 12 year old girl, his acting does not offer much, and I always feared my brains turning into mush as an inevitable side-effect of watching any of his projects. <p>That is until this film....<p>Dicaprio plays John, the member of an Irish immigrant gang, who are earnestly trying to make their way in turn of the century NYC against insurmountable odds (including anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiment). Juggling basic survival needs against resources, he sets out to avenge the death of his father himself killed off by one of the street gangs <p>Boss Tweed (Daniel Day Lewis ) is only open to these afforementioned newcomers to the extent they will maintain his power structure exactly as it is. The actual provision of social services as myself and many other 21st century Americans understand them (even in the era of goverment downsizing) is non-existent. Mutiple fire departments spend more time amongst themselves arguing who should be privlleged enough to put out an inferno (and receive money) than saving lives. <p>The Civil War is roaring, but the North is just as suceptible to racism as the more doccumented South from liberal usage of racial slurs throughout the film, and scenes of one pro-slavery rally. For individuals such as myself who were students of American policy and had fancied ourselves educated individuals, complex reality was very jarring. The working class youths volunteering for Union Army conscription do so out of realization this may be the only practical way to get food than racial justice as myself and others currently understand that concept.<p>Eeerily foreshadowing the Flordia 2000 scandal, Boss Tweed's political coruption is a centrail theme of life for many imigrants. Personally, these same people do not like him, but understand a working relationship is important for their survival. Individuals who do not vote when and how the machine wants can expect swift retribution and vote counters themselves wield inordinate amounts of political power. American society made some important advances since the Nineteeth Century, but in some respects we are dealing with the same issues because they were not properly handled the first time. <p>For all of it's mentioned pluses, this film has some serious limitations. The realities of abdominal surgery (dangerous/fatal until development of antiseptic surgery and antibiotics during the 1930's) is repeatedly ignored in several storylines so the characters can make medical recoveries commonplace with Twentieth and Twenty First Century medical innovations. Only once is the procedural-historical seriousness remembered (Cameron Diaz's Cesarian Section) but even this scene only dwells on the risk temporarily instead of treating it as a running theme throughout every person's life. <p>Overall, this is a good film which will readily entertain political and party animals alike. The long run time is compensated by the lively plot and characters throughout the entire film.</p></body></html>

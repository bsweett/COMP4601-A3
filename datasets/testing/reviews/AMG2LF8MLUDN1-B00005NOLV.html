There have been oodles of movies where the heroic space travelers lurch forward in time to find earth in a completely different state.  But when "Apes" was released and we found that the planet was ruled by monkeys, that took the cake!  Charlton Heston is one of our heroic space travelers here.  The theory of talking ape evolution is very interesting even if not very likely.  In one of the later of the Ape series we find that humans are using apes to perform menial tasks but an uprising takes place.  They are not only used as slave labor but mistreated as well.  Monkey racism I guess you'd call it.  That uprising is spearheaded by Ceasar, a talking chimpanzee (played by the late Roddy McDowall).<br /><br />The series takes us forwards and backwards to show us how the simian race was able to take over in the first place.  Unfortunately, the later films in the series are not the same caliber as the first but some of you may still find them enteraining nonetheless.<br /><br />As for the first Ape film, you would expect that the ape makeup would count for 90% of the acting but gratefully, the acting is top notch in spite of the makeup jobs. The ending really blows you away because you're involved in the film so much that you aren't trying to figure out where the astronauts have landed.  You just want to know why the monkeys are talking.  Also interesting is that the apes have their own heirarchy.  The gorillas are the brutes so they are all soldiers.  The chimps are intelligent so they are the scientists and the orangutangs are the elite so they rule the land.<br /><br />I suggest that if you are not familiar with the entire series that you just start with Planet of the Apes for now.  At least that way if you're disappointed you can stop there and you won't have wasted money on the rest of the series which many consider to be substandard.<br /><br /> Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) is nowhere near the quality of the first "Apes" but it's box office success lead to the relase of Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) which is a little better storywise.  Then came Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) and finally Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973).  If you're a collecter then you should have all the Ape films.  If you're really planning to watch them for entertainment value then Planet of The Apes and Escape from the Planet of the Apes are your best bets.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DiCaprio's finest performance ever"></head><body><p>I hated Leonardo DiCaprio until I saw this. I thought he was a sissy (Man in the Iron Mask, Titanic, Romeo and Juliet). He really surprised me with this one though. I am very surprised that he didn't even get an oscar nomination. Tom Hanks did a fine job too. Everybody can expect that! The best role of the whole film though went to Christopher Walken, playing as DiCaprio's Father who became a total loser. Chris Walken was amazing. It truly was his best role since his oscar-winning performance in "The Deer Hunter" in 1978. Stephen Spielberg is an impressive director who always comes through. "Catch Me if you Can" is among the finest con artist movies I've seen. I can't wait until May 6th to buy the dvd. This isn't something that really young kids should see, nor would they enjoy it. Its PG-13 rating reflects some sexual situations and language. Don't miss "Catch Me if you Can"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Something To Buy This Holiday Season- Inspiring"></head><body><p>This movie is INSPIRATIONAL and is definately a movie I'd buy for anyone on my Christmas wishlist. This movie tugs at your emotional heart strings and makes you leave the theater wanting to be a better human being. Based on a true story during the Rwandain genocide that sadly went on unnoticed to the rest of the world.<br /><br />Paul a man living in Rwanda desperately wants to help his Tutsi wife and three children survive the genocide- hides not only his family but hundreds of Tutsis in the hotel he works at... making sure that they are fed, have a place to sleep and are safe. He does everything in his power to help these people from bribing soliders and virtually begging the United Nations for aide. He ends up becoming a true hero.<br /><br />Paul a common man with common thoughts is portrayed in the movie to be just someone who wanted to help- his act a selfish one in the fact that he could not stand the idea of people being killed and sitting back and watching. The scenes are graphic and disturbing as you hear screams in the street as children and women ared dragged away to die at the hands of a machetti. You see Paul go from being a reasonabley wealthy Rwandian to one that must hide in his hotel and cross corpses on his way to work.<br /><br />The movie dosn't distract unlike Schindler's List- the story focuses solely on Paul and the dilemeas he faces in keeping those in his hotel alive- while you hear/see the events unfolding around him. It is a crime that the movie did not win best picture of the year or that Don Cheadle didn't recieve an Oscar for his OUTSTANDING performance. This movie shows that he is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood.<br /><br />This is a movie that I wish Hollywood made more of- for it's one of those movies that makes you more aware and realize that this CAN never happen again- I felt guilty after watching the movie that the US did not do anything to stop the masacree. It's our responsibility and duty as Americans to prevent these genocides from occuring- right now there is a similiar genocide going on in Sudan. After seeing this movie and the horror- imagine if it was you and your family- what would you do? This movie will make you want to change the world. I hope that people after seeing this movie will decide- we MUST do something. A great movie- well worth it's pricetag and definately a movie to own!</p></body></html>

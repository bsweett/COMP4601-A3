Hopefully nomitated for some awards"></head><body><p>I missed this film in the theaters, but now the chance has arrived on DVD, and it was good. Ed Norton does a solid job in his role as Eisenheim the illusionist, but Paul Giamatti is great, and should earn an oscar nomination again.  A fictional story taking place in turn of 20th the Century Austria, Giamatti in the role of city chief inspector narrates a film about Eisenheim, an illusionist in vienna  making big noise with his spectacular illusions.  It even gets the attention of Prince Leopold, and more importantly, his soon to be fiancee (Jessica Biel).  I don't want to spoil the movie, but history is layed out and certain paths have crossed before, and then the movie becomes a bunch of smoke and mirrors, Is anything what it seems?  A good movie for the collection, great original story.  A good mystery, and even a little romance.  Check this one out, hopefully the hollywood snobs won't skip this one on Oscar night.</p></body></html>

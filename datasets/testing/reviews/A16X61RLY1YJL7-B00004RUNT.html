<meta name="summary" content="The Fifth Element - An outstanding Sci-Fi/Comedy!"></head><body><p>The Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis and the ever beautiful and alluring Milla Jovovich is definitely among my most favorite films of all time.  This is one of those rare films that I can watch over and over again, despite a good majority of it being based in comedy where you'd think it would get old but it doesn't.  Bruce Willis's performance is up to par with his "hero" persona and right on with his comedic tendencies.  Milla Jovovich, wow!  She is incredibly beautiful and was extraordinarily well matched for this particular role.  Gary Oldman also does an outstanding job as the "quasi" villain of the film as he's set as the comedic pawn of evil.  Visually, director Luc Besson puts to screen an interesting futuristic earth.<p>The premise:<p>Set approximately three hundred years in the future, this outstanding film begins with a look into the past setting up the need for the "fifth" element.  Cutting back to the future we meet Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) who is a retired Major from Earth's military!  He's down on his luck and working as cab driver.  We then have the privilege of seeing Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) being reconstructed!  Through chance and circumstance Leeloo literally flings herself into Korben's cab.  What follows from this point is nothing short of one of the most hilarious and intriguing Sci-Fi/comedy films to grace the silver screen and the home theater!<p>Special Features:<p>If you're into DVD's jam packed with all kinds of special features, "The Fifth Element" isn't for you!  Normally, this is something I do not mind as the main reason I purchase DVD's is for the film itself, in this case though it would've been nice to at least thrown in a theatrical trailer or something, but alas there are no special features on this DVD.<p>I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the genre or the stars that perform so admirably in this film!  {ssintrepid}</p></body></html>

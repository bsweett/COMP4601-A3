<meta name="summary" content="Would you honestly want to erase a love that broke your heart?"></head><body><p>Strange because I watched this film on home video in Boston right after a kind of break-up. He (Boston guy) swooned over Kate Winslet and said that the concept was ridiculous. I, on the other hand, wished such a medical technology could be invented, perfected, patented, and commercialized NOW. Freeing up all sorts of support groups and therapist offices from the heartbroken and lovelorn in just one delete button to our brain. Love sears the brain no doubt. And when it goes sour it really drives us somewhat mental. But really .... would you truly want to erase the memories with someone you loved? My verdict - NO. Painful as it is these memories are still very sacred and that person very special. I still would have erased Boston guy (and New Jersey blind date guy from the previous year) in the click of a mouse but never the Toronto guy who came as a complete and welcome surprise a long while later after my Massachussetts episode.<br /><br />Joel and Clementine have their moments as a couple. Their breakup is pretty dramatic and before he knows it Celemtine has impulsively had her memory bank erased to get over Joel. In his desperation Joel seeks to do the same but somehow during the process ... he fights for every last bit of memory. He still wakes up "clear" of Clementine but fate has other plans and they meet that afternoon and start all over again. The dream sequence as Joel resists the process are psychedelic and poignant. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a touching lesson for all of us ... if love is a battlefield (quoting Pat Benetar) having battlescars is nothing to be ashamed of. It's better to have the memory of cherished love despite a permanent separation ... than to have no concept of what it means to ever give your heart and yourself away. Some risks are worth the bittersweet memories they create.</p></body></html>

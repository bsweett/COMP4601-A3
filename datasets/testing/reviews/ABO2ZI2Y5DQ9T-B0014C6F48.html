<meta name="summary" content="Fluffy Version of 'Big' Could Have Been Better With Another Director"></head><body><p>It is a pity that with rising star like Jennifer Garner '13 Going On 30' could have been a much better film. I don't care if the film is predictable. I don't care if the film is virtually a retread of superior Tom Hanks film `Big.' No, but I was hugely disappointed by the film simply because the director - whoever he is - misses every opportunity to make the heroine more interesting, more charming, and most of all, more believable.<br /><br />Jenna Rink, a slightly geeky 13-year-old girl living in the 80s, wakes up to find that she is now a 30 year-old woman living in the year of 2004. This is the meaning of the film's title, I think, but this is also the weakest part of it. Think about this. At the age of 30, Jenna finds that 17 years later she is the editor of one magazine Poise, she is friends with Madonna, and is living with a hunky popular professional hockey player. And she is living in New York City while her mentality remains that of 13 year old. And no one suspects the truths while watching Jenna suddenly start to act strangely (to them).<br /><br />OK, but you might say, how about `Big'? Yes, Tom Hanks managed to live as an adult after being turned into an innocent one. But he was working for a toy maker, if I remember correctly, and that setting sounds reasonable, and his acting is so believable (and he got an Oscar nomination.) But if you ask me to believe a 30 year-old-woman can suddenly start dancing to the Michael Jackson song `Thriller' and turn a dismally bad party floor into a great success, you are asking too much from me. You may get a few laughs seeing it, but you may also feel embarrassed seeing Jennifer Garner doing a zombie dance.<br /><br />I'm not complaining about her or the familiar premise of the film (of which script comes from the writer team of `What Women Want').But unlike that Mel Gibson/Helen Hunt romantic comedy, the title '13 Going On 30' is not exactly accurate. Jenna, as you see, should still remain a 13-year-old girl living in the 80s, but the same Jenna apparently has no trouble dealing with a cell phone, showing no surprise using it. But at the same time Jenna does not get the sexual nuance of her supposed boyfriend's remarks about `play the game.' I don't point out these inconsistencies one by one. In short, the film suggests she thinks like a 13-year-old girl trapped inside the body of a 30-year-old lady, but in fact she often acts like a 30-year-old woman trapped inside the body of the same age. These gaps are only damaging the film because as far as the characters go, it is the smallest details that really matter in this kind of comedy based on strange situations. Watch another body-switching film `Freaky Friday' in which everything fits in the right place and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />Finally about the actors. Many seem to be praising the acting of Jennifer Garner. I beg to disagree. It is Mark Ruffalo as Jenna's long-estranged love Matt who is really the best thing in this film. He represents a mature man with sound judgment and good-natured personality, and he does it without making the film too sentimental. You immediately realize that he is the man Jenna should have loved, and you understand why she is attracted to him. The only thing I cannot understand is, how come he is attracted to Jenna, whose behaviors are either childlike or childish, and always impossible..</p></body></html>

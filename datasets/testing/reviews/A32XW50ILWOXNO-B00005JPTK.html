<meta name="summary" content="Desolation gives way to the an attack of the Bat Boy"></head><body><p>Give director Francis Lawrence this much credit for his work in "I Am Legend:" He knew how to stick a sword in its belly. The movie is all kinds of ridiculous - in part because it holds its cards practically *inside* the vest for the opening act - and Lawrence, instead of succumbing to hubris and letting it drag on for a craptacular two-and-a-half hours (like most blockbusters these days) he ends it, mercifully, at 90 minutes. Yeah, maybe it's because the zombies look like Bat Boy from the Weekly World News, but still - brevity is a virtue.<br /><br />Stripped of all the subplots that made Richard Matheson's source novel so compelling (and the inspiration for some good films, comics, and books since its printing in the 1950s), "I Am Legend" is a vaguely intriguing "Cast Away" vehicle for Will Smith until it must deliver some action goods, which is does efficiently and without any particular rules or sense whatsoever, before closing on a old fashioned Blow Up Real Good sequence. This explosion, really, is the perfect ending for the film Lawrence actually made. Some moviegoers - who have invested far too much thought in this lame experience - prefer the "alternate ending." Not I, for reasons that simply don't matter.<br /><br />Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last "survivor" in New York City of a cancer vaccine gone viral. Most New Yorkers died upon contracting the illness; others mutated into rubber-faced, physically amazing zombies that hate the sunlight, even though, unlike the spiritually touched vampire, they're simply mutations, which means they'd need sunlight to...oh, never mind. If you want to believe the sun could crash into a black hole and these creatures could survive, go ahead. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman provides all of this with a somber sincerity that informs the movie's look and tone in the first half-hour; Neville and his German shepherd stalk the streets of an overgrown NYC in near silence, as Lawrence keeps the soundtrack music to a minimum. Like "Cast Away," it's compelling to hear the sounds of the world in this film. Unlike "Cast Away," it also seems like a way to blow 30 minutes without having to show those ridiculous zombies.<br /><br />So Neville's still after a cure for the mutation, and he carefully orchestrates traps so he can capture "subjects" for tests; despite the end of civilization, all of the utilities still work and the gas pumps aren't dry, so Neville uses a giant, state-of-the-art lab for his work. The zombies seem to be getting smarter, though, plotting their own revenge on the "hunter." Sandwiched in there are some flashbacks of NYC's last night as a living (and implausibly civilized) city and the fate of Neville's wife and daughter. These are effective enough, but they're also cheat, really - the movie doesn't want to give Neville the same struggle he has in the novel.<br /><br />It's right about then that Lawrence gets his hustle on; Goldsman shuttles a couple more survivors onscreen so the title can make the least bit of sense, but Neville doesn't want much to do with them. There's a raid, a showdown, and a big boom. Or, if you prefer, the alternate love-in. Blammo. Over.</p></body></html>

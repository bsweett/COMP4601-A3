<meta name="summary" content="Great Price For A Great Movie"></head><body><p>King Kong is a classic that never gets old, this DVD is worth getting if you don't already have the more expensive version of the 1933 classic that was release on DVD a few months ago. The picture is clear but there are no extras on the film except for commentary.<br /><br />No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never gets old. Compared to the new movie, this film seems to lack the emotion the newer version has, but it doesn't stop me from loving this movie. Overall a great DVD to buy at a cheap price if you don't already own this movie. Lack of any real extras, but still good</p></body></html>

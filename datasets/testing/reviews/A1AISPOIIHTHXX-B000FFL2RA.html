<meta name="summary" content="Too bad the film in history will only exist on DVD"></head><body><p>We have Director's Cuts and Extended Editions. The former is usually what the director initially intended before studio executives got ideas about what the film should be while the latter is usually an optional version, a "if you want to, here it is" cut of the film. Before we had Gladiator getting an extended edition which oddly didn't work out in its favor and we have the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven which is probably even better than the normal cut than previously thought.<br /><br />It's 1181 and Balian is in a particular depressed mood. His son died and in her grief, his wife committed suicide which is a big Christian no-no. He comes across his father, Godfrey, and he finds out that he can potentially right his and his wife's problems if he goes to Jerusalem only things aren't so great there. King Baldwin has leprosy and his health is deteriorating and there's a power struggle on who will be the next King. Meanwhile, Muslim hero Saladin wants Jerusalem for him and his people and 200,000 people are on their way to take it.<br /><br />Some longer versions of the film merely add to one of the film's problems or corrects them. Gladiator, awesome in its battle scenes but uninteresting in its political intrigue scenes, got even more of them in the extended cut. With this film, we get more insight into characters that maybe aren't as strong either way. For example, hero Balian is somehow who firmly sets himself in ideals yet he sleeps with a man's wife but he won't take up the crown and marry that man's sister and have him executed even if said man is power hungry. He just never really was much of an interesting character to begin with and seeing more of his moral flipflopping was odd.<br /><br />Maybe it's just getting old now but seeing 200,000 men descend on another large group of men and wage war isn't as thrilling anymore. Yes it's visually impressive but after seeing it in all 3 Lord of the Rings movies, then Troy then some others I probably haven't seen, it's just not as stunning to see. However, the scene itself works well with brutal combat and flaming fireballs and large towers(too LotR there too) and instead of admiring the effects, I just simply watch it. However, you'll usually get great visuals from Ridley Scott's movies and this one has it with some striking cinematography shots of landscapes.<br /><br />Acting-wise it's straight across the board with particular attention to Edward Norton as King Baldwin who, like Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta, manages to be captivating even when his face is shielded by a mask. However it only falls apart once but it's in a key area: the casting of Balian. Despite a fluttering moral compass, it's our main man and Orlando Bloom just simply doesn't cut it. Yeah the guy can fight but he's not as emphatic or charismatic.<br /><br />You should definately check out the film and rid yourself of the memories or thought of its much-maligned theatrical cousin and watch this instead.</p></body></html>

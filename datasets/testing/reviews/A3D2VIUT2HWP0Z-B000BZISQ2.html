<meta name="summary" content="Buy It !!!"></head><body><p>I Saw and Have TERMINATOR and T2, and I also have the DVD's of Both ,Including the First release of the Special Edition ( Actually 2 copies, one unopened in a Metal Case, and the one I use in a Silver Cardboard Pack).<br />I thoroughly Enjoyed T3.<br />It's all Set up for a Franchise, and with any Luck Either Arnold, or someone else ( Please God not the &quot;Rock&quot;) Will Carry on the Series.<p>Hopefully the Script and Director for T4 will be better, but... It's a Blast, and the Sergeant Candy scene is full on funny.<p>No Deep Meaning, just a Standard set of Blow em up, shoot em out fun.</p></body></html>

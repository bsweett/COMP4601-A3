<meta name="summary" content="Reconciliation"></head><body><p>Most children start out their lives idealizing their parents in one way or another, and the pedestals are slowly hacked away, but sometimes a new one is erected. Growing up, Will (Billy Crudup) idealized his father, believing all of his incredible, tall tales of adventure - even including his own dramatic birth.<p>Now in his thirties, married and with a baby of his own on the way, Will must now tie up loose ends with his father who is dying of cancer.  Edward Bloom (as a young man, Ewan McGregor, present day portrayal by Albert Finney) seems to touch success everywhere he goes, not having much himself, but enriching the lives of those around him. His sweet smile and positive outlook make him not only an effective salesman of useless household objects, but a salesman of himself and his &quot;big fish&quot; stories.<p>Disgusted wih his father's apparent allergic reaction to telling a simple fact instead of a tall tale, Will has let 3 years pass without a word between them, but now must face the reality that time is now his worst enemy.  Will finally confronts his father, telling him, &quot;I don't know who you are.&quot; Will leaves in a huff, and going through his father's papers, begins to investigate the truth of his father's past.<p>As Will begins to unravel the tapestry his father has woven, he finds that &quot;not everything (he) has said is a complete fabrication&quot; as his mother (Jessica Lange) tells him... and some of the most unbelievable of his stories turn out to be very true, albeit sometimes a little exaggerated.  Will finds himself turning back into that young, believing child - rebuilding even a bigger pedestal to place his father upon - the opposite of what he expected.<p>It's easy to understand Will's resentment - his own mother, while not telling her own tall tales, never seems to be a voice of reason - expecting a young child to grow up not knowing what is real - her sole focus in life seems to be on her husband, and very little focus is on raising the little human they've created together.<p>Those who have recently lost a loved one may find a poignant scene between the father and son a little too close to home, a truly bittersweet moment of heart-wrenching reconciliation.<p>Lots of light hearted moments and tongue-in-cheek scenes break what little tension the viewer experiences.  Some language a partial nudity make this unsuitable for young viewers, but compared to broadcast television, it is quite tame.</p></body></html>

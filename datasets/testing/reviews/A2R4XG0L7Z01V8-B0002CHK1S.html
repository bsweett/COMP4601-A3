I'm sure my groans could be heard for miles, and I'm pretty sure I missed a couple of scenes, due to hiding my face in the chair. I could have done without seeing a dog's head splitting open. There's blood and body parts flying all over - arms are bitten off, heads detach and one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The stuff of nightmares if I'd been a few years younger.<br /><br />I'd previously never heard of this film, nor did I know that Kurt Russell played a character called MacReady. I thought that was pretty cool. Not so keen on the beard though. Ugh!<br /><br />The only quibble I have with this movie, is there appears to be a strictly no females policy on board somewhere! There are no female characters in the film. The only female presence in the movie is in the voice of MacReady's chess computer and the contestants seen on the game show that Palmer watches. A scene containing a blow-up doll was filmed and then left on the cutting room floor. Additionally, one of the crew was a woman but she fell ill during the outdoor shoot and was replaced with a man. Why no women? It totally reminded me of Ghosts of Mars - just better. And there were women in that.<br /><br />For a scene where a character's arms are severed, a real-life double amputee stand-in was used wearing a mask in the likeness of the character. The audience focuses on the bloody stumps while the mask goes unnoticed. In the scene where Norris' (Charles Hallahan) head separates from his body, special-FX designer Rob Bottin used highly inflammable materials for the construction of interior of the head and neck models. During the shoot John Carpenter decided that, for continuity reasons, they needed some flames around the scene. Without thinking they lit a fire bar and the whole room, which by now was filled with inflammable gasses, caught fire. Nobody got hurt, but the entire special effects model, on which Bottin had worked several months, was destroyed.<br /><br />You can literally FEEL how cold it is watching this movie, and I swear, I was feeling the cold!<br /><br />Hollywood are getting bad for doing this - releasing a DVD, and then releasing a bigger, better & badder version a few months later. It's not so bad if it's years after the original release, but this is getting unbelievable. Sometimes if you compare the DVDs, there's hardly any difference, and sometimes, you'll have to keep both DVDs, cos they both have different extras. The extras on this include: commentary by director John Carpenter and Kurt Russell; documentary "John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape" featuring interviews with John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, make-up designer Rob Bottin, matte artist Albert Whitlock, and other cast and crew members, plus outtakes, work-in-progress special effects footage and behind-the-scenes footage; behind-the-scenes photographs; storyboards and conceptual art; and annotated production archive.<br /><br />If you're a huge fan of gore, that isn't really showing its age, then go ahead and get this. Once seen, it won't be forgotton.</p></body></html>

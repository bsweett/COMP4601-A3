<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino is still the best"></head><body><p>This two-parter is the best thing Tarantino has done since Pulp Fiction. My wife hated the first part last year, so I had to go to this one with some like-minded friends, and we loved it. We know now that the Bride's real name is Beatrix Kiddo (nice bit of tongue-in-cheek) and Umas Thurman long, lanky style fits the role perfectly. Michael Madsen is terrific as Bill's brother, Budd. And David Caradine is an instant classic as Bill. Again, Tarantino builds great individual scenes, including the last fight between Beatrix and Elle (Daryl Hannah), the black mamba bit, Bill's analysis of comic book superhero character-types, and the entire burial alive chapter. My friends felt a bit cheated that the showdown between the Bride and Bill wasn't a cataclysmic samurai sword scene, but I thought the rather understated Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique was a perfect, unexpected Tarantino ending.</p></body></html>

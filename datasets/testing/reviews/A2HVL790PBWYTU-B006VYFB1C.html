MONEYBALL can be enjoyed as a compelling underdog sports film, or as a terrifically-acted drama, or as a slice of Americana. This is the biopic of Billy Beane and how he changed the game of baseball, or the numbers crunching bits of it anyway. I confess that when Billy Beane first overhauled the Oakland A's system back in the early oughts, I was as skeptical as any guy watching from a distance and taking in his odd shenanigans. But then the Oakland Athletics made that historic run. Back then, I remained a skeptic. It took this film and its examination of the nuts and bolts of the moneyball process for me to fully appreciate what this man had done. This film injects a bit of soulfulness into a soulless system that is inherently calculating and is all about the gathering and analyzing of computer-generated statistical data to draft a team's players. You have to remember that Billy Beane had no choice but to go the sabermetric route.<br /><br />Beane has an insider's perspective. He, after all, actually was in the show, having played in the professional league for some years... and abjectly failing. How must it have felt to be courted by baseball scouts and skipping college to go pro, only to realize that you don't belong? It painfully dawns on Beane that scouts don't really have any magic formula. Sometimes, the product is purchased based on its potential and it doesn't pan out, like Beane didn't pan out. He opted for a sudden career shift, becoming a scout himself. From there he rose up the career ladder and ended up General Manager of the Oakland A's. And yet his inner demons continue to haunt him.<br /><br />Brad Pitt deserves all the award nominations he gets. He is so good here. As MONEYBALL opens with Oakland and its big guns getting eliminated in the playoffs, the camera shoots to a frustrated Billy Beane who prefers to listen to the game on the radio rather than actually watching it. With Oakland done for the season, Beane focuses on rebuilding the team, what with free agency threatening to take away Oakland's marquee players. Except that the A's are a small market team, and the owner just can't compete with the obscene salaries doled out by the big market teams (cough*damnyankees*cough). The owner directs Beane to make do with the budget he's got, which is a pittance.<br /><br />"You don't put a team together with a computer, Billy," some naysayer remarks, but never mind that. The moneyball scheme was constructed by a desperate Beane and lowly Yale economics graduate and stats fiend Peter Brand (a shockingly effective Jonah Hill). Brand is based on Paul DePodesta who was Billy Beane's real-life assistant. The film goes on to chronicle how the 2002 Oakland A's became the laughingstock of the Major League Baseball with its dismal early losses and its no-name roster made up of players who are either too old or who throw funny or have unmanageable tempers. "Island of misfit toys," is how someone describes it. But, somewhere along the way, Oakland began to surge up the rankings and then there was that phenomenal winning streak, another instance of fact being stranger than fiction. Nowadays what MLB team isn't using sabermetrics?<br /><br />Pitt's performance fuels the film, but his outstanding rapport with Jonah Hill and with Kerris Dorsey, who plays his sensitive young daughter, cannot be overlooked. It's never as good as when Pitt is sharing a scene with either of them. But you have to credit Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian's sharp, lively, and emotionally satisfying screenplay. You'll laugh and cheer and maybe even get misty-eyed. I don't think it's a secret anymore that Brad Pitt really can act, but the man's suffered from the infamous pretty face syndrome. When he finally began to show wear and tear on his mug, I think that's when folks began to take him seriously as an actor. In MONEYBALL he commands the screen utterly. Just give him the Oscar already and let's all go home.</p></body></html>

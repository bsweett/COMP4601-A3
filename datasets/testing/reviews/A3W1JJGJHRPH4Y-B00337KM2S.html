<meta name="summary" content="A witty look at downsizing"></head><body><p>This movie did an amazing thing it took a fairly serious look at downsizing at a personal level at various companies, but it made me smile almost all the way through the movie. The movie took place in cities like Omaha, Des Moines, Milwaukee and Detroit. The movie didn't pull punches at the final interviews. I've been downsized and this felt real. These people were hurting in different ways. The laughable help the company provides for placement was just right. My manager gave me a help wanted page ad from the local paper for a job $40k less than my current salary and for which I wasn't really qualified. He must have spent a minute looking for it. However, the movie did not lambaste the companies. The companies were hurting too.  The movie did not take the obvious route in most of the movie. There were some nice twists.<br /><br />The actors were all good, but George Clooney was great. He exhibited just the right amount of charm and denial. He was going through a mid life crisis and there were no easy answers. He had the life he wanted, but realized it was empty. He daily job of firing people emphasized his own emptiness. Clooney's character was an inspirational speaker too. His speech was hilarious and scary. Some people think this way.<br /><br />Jason Bateman was good too. He played the boss, who was trying to run the company the best way he knew how, but basically was an insensitive jerk. Who else could come up with a company like this?<br /><br />I strongly recommend the movie. It has comedy, charm, and pathos. It is a great look at our society and what it values.</p></body></html>

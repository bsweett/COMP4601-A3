<meta name="summary" content="Stallone's Best In Years- Saw it in the Theatres"></head><body><p>I don't give 5 stars to just anything. But I saw this in the theatres and it blew me away. I saw it twice, as a matter of fact. Simply, Stallone's best movie in years, probably his best movie since Cliffhanger that just had this universal appeal. Why is Stallone able to do anything he wants, from Demolition Man, Rambo and even Stop or My Mom Will Shoot? His success with Rocky. This last installment in the up and down Rocky series sees Stallone returning Rocky to his origins as gothic, yes, gothic and a bum. It was the best entry in the Rocky series since the first one, probably better than Rocky 2. Adrian dies and Stallone fights real life champ Mason Dixon. A has been, Rocky against someone at the top of his game whose own popularity and credible legacy are in doubt. Stallone forray as the "man/actor of the 90s" is going here to the millenium man. Every Stallone movie will be big and make millions, routine box office triumphs for Stallone who can still wow the ladies at like age 55 or whatever he is. I'll give away a spoiler so don't read further unless you want it really bad (ROCKY GOES THE DISTANCE YET AGAIN AND GETS A SPLIT DECISION!!! IT WOULD'VE BEEN TOO PREDICTABLE IF HE WON!!!)</p></body></html>

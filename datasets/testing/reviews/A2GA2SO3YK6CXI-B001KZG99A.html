<meta name="summary" content="Simply Awesome!"></head><body><p>We have seen this movie three times already. First, we enjoyed it by ourselves; then, with friends and finally with the family.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays the lead role of this superhero story. Tony Stark is a brilliant individual who graduates from MIT at an early age and goes on to design many of the weapons sold by the company his father founded.<br /><br />The movie immediately hooked us for we see Stark visiting the Middle East, delivering weapons and demonstrating the power behind his designs. The pace is amazing as we confront terrorists who to Stark's horror and dismay; use the very weapons he designed for our protection as the tools of mass destruction. How is this possible if he only sells to friends?<br /><br />Stark is captured and transforms into Iron Man by a suit he designs that makes him indestructible, with weapons to fight innumerable enemies and able to fly to safety.<br /><br />He escapes and comes back home where his assistant, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is waiting for him at the airport. It is fun to watch Stark tell her "the vacation is over" and that the first thing he MUST do is eat a cheeseburger. Burger King must have paid a fortune for this ad.<br /><br />The technology used in this movie is razor edge, his ability to design in a three dimensional environment is simply awesome. As usual, the bad guys interfere at every turn and he discovers that the force behind his many encounters with challenges is in the identity of which he thought was a close "friend."<br /><br />This movie provided adventure, romance, intrigue and comedy. We have seen it three times and something tells me we shall soon want to see it again, therefore, we highly recommend purchasing as opposed to going to the movies or renting it. Don't miss it... it is AWESOME!!!</p></body></html>

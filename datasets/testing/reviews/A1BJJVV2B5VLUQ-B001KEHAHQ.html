<meta name="summary" content="Even Peter Sellers would hate this film"></head><body><p>I dig Steve Martin from back in the days of "The Jerk", "Planes Trains & Automobiles", "Parenthood" and "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"... even his "Bringing Down The House" was unexpectedly great. But, I have to say that Petter Sellers would be rolling over in his grave upon watching this mess. Sellers was a subtle comic genious. As much as I like Martin, he's simply trying too hard to be funny (as is Kevin Klein). Not to mention the physical comedy aspect of it - the gags just weren't funny. You could tell all the stunt people were on wires. Sure I went into this with some expectations - only because I like Steve Martin and I loved the old Pink Panther movies so much. My prediction - Peter Sellers fans, Steve Martin fans, and fans of the old Pink Panther movies will be thoroughly disappointed. DVD extras are minimal - too bad - Martin's outtakes or a gag reel would've been fun to see. Easily one of the worst movies I've seen in 2006. And, perhaps the worst Steve Martin movie I've seen - right down at the bottom next to "Mixed Nuts" and "Sgt Bilko". Rent before you purchase.</p></body></html>

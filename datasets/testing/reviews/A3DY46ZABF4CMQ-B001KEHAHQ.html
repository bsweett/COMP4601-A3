<meta name="summary" content="Martin has his moments"></head><body><p>Remakes, remakes, remakes.<br /><br />Aren't there any creative writers who can make originals anymore?<br /><br />After viewing The Pink Panther, that thought will probably come crossing through your head. If not, then you probably thought this was the funniest movie you have ever seen, and that Steve Martin (The Jerk, Bringing Down The House) is a genius for introducing the whackiest onscreen detective turned inspector.<br /><br />The Pink Panther is actually a remake of the comedy classic starring Peter Sellers (The Party) as the 'original' Inspector Clouseau, a dim-witted detective assigned to some serious high profile cases that he, somehow with a strike of luck and ridiculousness, ends up solving.<br /><br />As the 'new' Inspector Clouseau, Martin fiddles his way through some very funny French accent drivel (especially the part where he's trying to learn how to say the word "hamburger"), laughable attempts to 'teach' his sidekick, a no-joke and far more Inspector-quality type detective Gilbert Ponton played hysterically by Jean Reno (the part where Martin and Reno pretend to be back-up dancers to Beyonce Knowles shows a side of Reno I never expected), about police work, and causing destruction by clumsily rolling a big brass ball through the streets of Paris, burning down the bathroom of Knowles, and unintentionally breaking his superior's, a French minister played by Kevin Kline, bones.<br /><br />Martin has his moments in Panther, but the movie overall just doesn't click into classic motion picture material like its predecessors had become. And as you see, I didn't go into the plot, something involving a big rock known as the Pink Panther getting stolen off the finger of a legendary soccor coach who is assassinated in the beginning, of the film because I found it irrelevent.<br /><br />The movie makes a good passing time but just nothing more than that, and with ending results that are far from spectacular.<br /><br />Mildly recommended<br /><br />C</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ray of Light"></head><body><p>If "Ray" does nothing else, it will show and inform the millions of people who eventually see it, that Ray Charles was a genius: not only in the music sense but in the financial and entrepreneurial arenas as well.<br /><br />These bio-dramas are always a little problematic for me in that I wonder: how much actually happened and how much has been dramatically enhanced or made up to make a  point? But even if you discount 50% of "Ray," Charles' life was still a grand, exciting trip for the old man of music.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles Robinson has been praised by many but frankly, like Charlize Theron's in "Monster," this is more caricature than dramatic performance. Foxx's performance never feels that it comes from the gut, internalized...it's all for show. It's flawlessly copied but it's empty.<br /><br />Director Taylor Hackford and his production crew have done a bang-up job with the look and feel of the movie and the musical bits are raucous and fun to hear and see.<br /><br />As far as the women in Ray's life: both Kerry Washington as Ray's wife Bea and Regina King as Margie are standouts in this large cast. Both Washington and King are able to get past the title of this film and show that they are fine, truthful actresses.<br /><br />"Ray" may not be everything we hoped but it is a lot more than we had any reason to expect. And as such, it is a fine tribute to the mighty Ray. May He Rest in Peace.</p></body></html>

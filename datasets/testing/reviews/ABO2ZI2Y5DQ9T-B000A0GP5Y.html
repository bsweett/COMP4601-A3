<meta name="summary" content="Fairly Amusing, But NO Originality Whatsoever"></head><body><p>The 1974 prison movie is remade AGAIN. The first remake was the 2001 film called `Mean Machine' staring soccer player-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, and now here comes another `The Longest Yard' with Adam Sandler. Both remakes are reasonably amusing, with the original story kept basically intact, plus the reasonable supporting cast, but I still don't know why the four film companies Columbia/Paramount/MTV/Happy Madison had to remake this film now.<br /><br />Adam Sandler plays the role of ex-NFL player Paul Crewe, who is sent to the jail in Texas after being arrested for `stealing' his girl friend's car and his reckless driving. The warden of the prison Hazen (James Cromwell) asks - or orders - Crowe to organize a football team for the inmates. The warden's idea is, the inmates' team must be so horrible that the guards' semi-professional football team can beat them easily, feeling happy and more confident.<br /><br />But you know, the inmates refuse to be losers. After enlisting a help from `Caretaker' (Chris Rock) and Coach Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), Paul Crowe's team named `Mean Machine' get stronger than he had expected.<br /><br />The director is Peter Segal, whose approach to the material is alarmingly silly at times (inmates' cheerleaders, for example), and as a result the tone of the film is at best very uneven. William Fichtner appears as sadistic prison guard, but his violence is soon forgotten in the following slapstick scenes with supports like Bob Sapp. All in all, the actors supply funny moments and the sports stunts are convincing. Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds are good, if not great, and the brief cameos from Cloris Leachman and Rob Schneider provide amusing scenes, but Sandler is least interesting, far cry from '50 First Date.'<br /><br />The overlong remake has little to offer except several funny scenes and amusing cameos. In the final chapter the film delivers the goods, but you have to go through the long road to reach that.</p></body></html>

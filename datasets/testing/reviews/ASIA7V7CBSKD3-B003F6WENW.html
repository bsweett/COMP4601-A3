<meta name="summary" content="Freaking Funny"></head><body><p>After being dissappoint by "Dodgeball" and "Anchorman" (they were funny, but not that funny) I went into "Crashers" expecting the same.  I was pleasantly surprised as not only was this one of the funniest movies of the year, but one of the funniest I've ever seen.  This is a must have, especially for those who are fans of Vaughn and Wilson.  Walken and McAdams also deliever grat preformances.  Buy this right now!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Wonderous & Different Vision of Roald Dahl's Novel"></head><body><p>MOVIE: The film opens to a montage of chocolate being made within the factory with the trademark Burton style and the trademark Elfman music. First off we must establish that this movie is aimed at the younger crowd, but I think Depp drew in the older crowd which led to the massive box office success. A lot of people compare this vision to the novel, but I like to look at the classic 1971 version of Roald Dahl's novel. The two are very different movies. Mel Stuart's Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was much more subtle and a tad bit mysterious. When we see Tim Burton's version it is much more whimsical, zany, and very loud. Burton opens the film with Charlie living in his crooked house (all to similar to Big Fish) down the road from the massive factory.  In Burton's version we get much more backstory about the character of Willy Wonka, we understand why he closed off his factory and why he went into seclusion and that turns out to be the downfall of the movie in an artistic sense. The movie is very entertaining, and it is laugh out loud at times, but in the end that's all that it is. We lose the idea that this is a satire on the way children are raised in today's society. The Oompa Loompa songs have now become broadway musicals instead of quirky rhymes with a point to be made. At times you can barely understand the lyrics of the songs, and that is where the film's message lies.  Burton presents Wonka as a man who is still just a child inside, who is struggling with his lost childhood and strict father.  In the orginal film the audience never really figured out the character of Willy Wonka, and that is why I prefer Gene Wilder's brilliant performance over Johnny Depp's extravagent wardrobes and make-up.  Gene Wilder had a presence, he had joy watching all those kids fall one at a time because he despised their attitudes as well as their parents. Johnny Depp may as well be one of the kids, it looks as if he is enjoying all the sparks and whistles more than seeing that these kids are learning the reality of things, which is the whole point that I feel is being missed.  I like how Tim Burton makes London covered in a blanket of snow, all white, and absent of any color except for the browns on the houses. The moment the doors open to Wonka's factory we are ambushed not only with color from Wonka's wacky wardrobe, but with a visual feast for the eyes within the factory itself.  The movie closes back outside the wintry white city and the character of Willy Wonka does go through a change. But is that really the character we are focusing on? I thought the children were supposed to learn something, not Willy Wonka? Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka already knew everything the kids did, and that was the reason he tested them with the everlasting gobstopper. This movie throws that idea out completely. All in all, it was a fun ride to be had but it feels just like another product of Hollywood. It lost the magic and heart that the original had, and I think it missed the point that Roald Dahl was trying to make.<br /><br />ACTING: Johnny Depp is great actor, everyone knows that. He adds a wacky spin to Willy Wonka that will remind you all too much of Michael Jackson. He is the star of the movie, I believe the next star is Deep Roy. The little man who was cast as every Oompa Loompa you see on screen. I guess it was an easy job since all he had to do was learn the dances and do them on a green screen, he didn't even have to sing.  All the vocals to the Oompa Loompa songs were provided by Danny Elfman, who also did the singing voice of Jack in Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas. Then we come to the children who I thought were horribly done, all except for Charlie Bucket played by Freddie Highmore. I thought the parents were jokes as well, we see more of the children than the parents and that's a flaw. The original focused on the parents much more because it was the fault of the parents that caused their children to be spoiled.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: It may sound like I hated the movie, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it was funny and entertaining, but I'm just not pleased that movies today are lacking in social commentaries. The original was able to be fun yet still have a very strong commentary. I also liked Gene Wilder's mysterious and menacing Wonka versus Depp's squeaky voiced and pale Wonka. I think A.O Scott of The New York Times hit the nail on the head when he called Tim Burton's Charlie & The Chocolate Factory ". . . wonderous and flawed."</p></body></html>

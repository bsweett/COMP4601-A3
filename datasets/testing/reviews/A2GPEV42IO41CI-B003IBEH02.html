<meta name="summary" content="Good IF you haven't read the book"></head><body><p>As the story opens, the narrator, 14-year old Susie, tells us she was murdered.  We then see a cringe-worthy scene (that doesn't actually show any violence) and Susie leaves earth for "the in-between;" a nice place, but not quite heaven.  She watches her family as they cope with her death and the years pass.<br /><br />I liked the book a lot, which is odd considering it's about a girl who is horrifically killed by a pervert.  Except for that one scene, however, the book was uniformly upbeat and uplifting and brought me to happy tears.  Susie loved being in her heaven, which looked like her beloved school and she could order peppermint ice cream anytime and never get told, "It's seasonal."  The movie changes quite a lot of important plot points, the most notable being that Susie's "in-between" is set in a big field amid beautiful mountains, but she's not happy there and is usually agitated or confused.  Instead of being joyous, the movie was very scary and relentlessly sad.<br /><br />Young Saoirse Ronan (already an Oscar-nominee) is perfectly cast as Susie - all wide-eyed innocence.  Stanley Tucci is subtly creepy as her killer, but wasn't quite loony enough.  Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz were too young and beautiful to play her parents, and Susan Sarandon was obnoxious as her grandmother.  Several characters who played key parts in the book were reduced to bit parts.  The movie was very intense, but also very depressing, while the book left me comforted.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you haven't read the book, you may well find this movie enthralling.  I thought too much emphasis was placed on the strikingly visual after-life, while the hopeful message was missing entirely.</p></body></html>

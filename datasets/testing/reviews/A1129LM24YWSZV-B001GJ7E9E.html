The premise of the movie is this: John and Jane Smith, after five (or six) years of rather lackluster marriage, visit a marriage counselor for a "tune-up." During their session, they admit to keeping "little secrets" from one another. We later learn that they are both assassins for hire, maintaining a secret life apart from one another. Their professional worlds collide, however, when they are both assigned to the same hit.<br /><br />In the ensuing scenes, the couple realizes the duplicity of their marriage as both are assigned to kill each other. A few rollicking shoot outs later, the two decide that perhaps their union is worth saving after all, and they decide to flaunt their employers and fight for one another. (I realize that this plot is not exactly brain surgery. However, how many moody, wordy, deep dramas can one watch? Sometimes a little mindless entertainment is exactly what is needed.)<br /><br />Aside from the physical perfection of both Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) and Brad Pitt (John Smith), their on-screen chemistry is great. In addition to great physical work in this movie, they both flex their comedic muscles to great effect. (I loved lines like, "You still alive down there, baby?" What a hoot!) And while the story line follows a very familiar path, it is still fully enjoyable.<br /><br />While violent, the carnage in this movie is not particularly graphic; it lives up to its PG13 rating. As no heavy mental lifting is required, it's great, indulgent entertainment. I would recommend this film for both couples and families with older children.</p></body></html>

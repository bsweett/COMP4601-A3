<meta name="summary" content="Not for everyone, but brilliant if it does appeal to you"></head><body><p>To begin with, this film is admirable purely on its technical achievements.  The puppets are outstanding, and they often convey more complex facial expressions that many real actors do!  I found myself amazed at the realism of the faces and eyes of the puppets.  The soundtrack of custom songs is also great, especially "Freedom Isn't Free."<br /><br />The movie has two main plot elements:  a satire of action flicks and commentary on America's position as the world police.  The action flick satire is brilliant, especially as Team America sets off on mayhem and destruction in the name of police work, often causing more damage than the bad guys were going to do!  Your take on the war commentary will most likely depend on your personal views.<br /><br />I'm rating this film high because I admire it and I think there is an audience for it out there, but on a personal level, I thought it was drawn out just a bit too much.  It might have been better as an extended skit or a smaller bit, not a full length feature film.  South Park is superior humor and modern political/cultural commentary, in my opinion.</p></body></html>

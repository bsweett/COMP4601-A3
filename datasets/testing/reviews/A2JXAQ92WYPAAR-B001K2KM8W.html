This film mixes the two, with great success in certain departments, but in others, it disappoints. Clearly, the Spanish Civil War will live in the hearts of liberals to the end of time, always depicted in the same way , with virtuous liberals fighting depraved fascists. It is easy to turn the audience against the fascists; they commit terrible crimes like being mean to children, and even meaner to the cute children's lovely mommies. But how can you get the audience to love a cipher? For myself, I couldn't have cared less about the heroes in the woods, and of course I hated with snarling father in his Darth Vadar uniform. Instead, I grew intrigued by the goofy fairy tale animals which resembled the kind of weird creatures in Star Wars, only here they live underground and are menacing. Still, I loved the monster guarding the banquet table and thought his hand-embedded eye balls a real treat. Over all, though, I hated the Spanish resistance members for their goodness as much as I hated the fascists for their cruelty. The whole lot were losers. The story was numbingly predictable and unenlightening. Like the Cold War struggles in America between the evil McCarthyites and the virtuous Hollywood liberals, this tale will continue to be told as long as intellectual go into the arts, but for God sake won't somebody finally realize that the audience has moved on?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very original....Good quality sci-fi flick"></head><body><p>For such an original idea this movie didn't do that well in theaters which I am surprised at considering it had good performances by Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, and Rufus Sewell. Anyways Dark City focuses on this man named John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) who awakens in a strange motel and can't remember a thing. On top of that he is wanted a for a series of murders. Under the Dark city lurks, these creepy underground dwellers who have the power to stop time and alter reality. They switch people's memories and create new ones as well. John Murdoch struggles to unravel his twisted identity but realizes that unraveling the truth can be fatal. Overall a very different original Sci-fi movie, amazing special effects, good acting. As for the dvd two solid commentaries and some comparisons on Fritz lang's "Metropolis" which isn't all that bad, but I guess since this movie wasn't that popular it won't be getting a special edition anytime soon. If it does come out I will deff. be purchasing it, well worth the extra money.</p></body></html>

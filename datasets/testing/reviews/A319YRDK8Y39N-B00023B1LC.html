<meta name="summary" content="A simple, fun spy flick"></head><body><p>The Bourne Identity doesn't really do anything new as an action film. It just does what it does well.<p>This is just one of those fun flicks to watch, enjoy and quickly forget. In telling the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA super secret agent who loses his memory but retains his spy training and knowledge, the film doesn't break any new ground. It covers all the standard spy genre staples without getting too clich&eacute;d (no outrageous spy gizmos a-la Bond), it tells an interesting story that isn't too overused, but formulaic enough to not be too stimulating, and provides ample excuses to bring on car chases and explosions.<p>Matt Damon adds a star to this flick, his presence always seems to raise the bar of any film he's in. It may not stretch his acting abilities, but it is fun to see him in the role of an action hero, even though his character doesn't remember he is. That amnesia is part of what makes Bourne work as a character. He isn't that confident, self-assured spy you usually get, he's confused and frightened by his physical and mental abilities. This theme of identity adds a lot to the film's atmosphere.<p>In a nutshell, don't expect anything but a good time with The Bourne Identity. It's not a memorable film, but it does it's job well.</p></body></html>

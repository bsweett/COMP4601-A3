<meta name="summary" content="Moody, emotional, intelligent and well acted horror"></head><body><p>Well above average haunted house film. As emotional as it is scary.<br /><br />The same could be said of most of producer Guillermo Del Toro's films.<br /><br />The story feels a little too familiar for most of it's length to quite<br />make it to classic film status, although the last 10 minutes do<br />elevate it to something more moving and more thoughtful than 95%of the<br />genre pictures currently being made.<br /><br />Wonderfully acted by Belen Rueda, as a mother whose child mysteriously<br />disappears. Well shot as well.<br /><br />The kind of film I look forward to re-watching, sure that now that I<br />know its secrets, there's even more to be uncovered.</p></body></html>

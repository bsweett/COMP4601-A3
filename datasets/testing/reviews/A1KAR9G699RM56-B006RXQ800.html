<meta name="summary" content="A plague hit the city, and then it died"></head><body><p>New York is renowned for being a tough town.  Only, in the mid-19th century it was more reminiscent of hell on earth.  In the midst of it all, natives and non-natives (mostly Irish) fought for their land, culture, and their home of Five Points.<br /><br />Scorsese, renovating the modern epic film, chooses New York as the backdrop, and the life of the gangs as his story.  This is all well intentioned, and as you might see, the film was pretty good.  However, this movie was limited by context, and in the sad story of it all.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio (as an Irish immigrant) and Daniel Day Lewis (as an already victorious kingpin) played the two main antitheses.  Both did extremely well, and Leonardo was successful yet again in breaching out to a new and exciting character: the underdog immigrant.<br /><br />Now, New York history has never been my interest, and although this movie sparked that in many others, and me there seemed to be an incredible lack of reason for this film's existence.  Now, I realize that this would never be an issue for an awful film, because there would be just a short brutal critique.  So maybe extra scrutiny is not justified, but Scorsese just never seemed to bring home the plot, the moral, or the point of this film.<br /><br />If anything it is brutal is as brutal does.  For the townspeople's lives (for they were that more then gang members) were built in blood, and although their farce of a society seems peaceful, one of the two leaders, or both, will have to do die in blood.<br /><br />Summarily, this is a nice timepiece for New York history.  Drawn out like a History Channel film, yet vivid and piercing as an action film.  A gory immigrants tale if there every was one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Acting and Direction"></head><body><p>First and foremost, this sure is not a feel good movie.  It is a violent and rugged movie about the world of drugs and money.  What this movie is; however, is an incredibly well-acted and absorbing film.  There is rarely a suspense-free or tension-less moment.  The movie, featuring excellent direction by the Cohen brothers, stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and the downright spooky Javier Bardem.  Woody Harrelson is also one of the stars.  There is no need to spend time discussing the plot as that has been done several times already.  This movie is worth seeing for the fine acting and directing, as well as the gritty realism of Texas and Mexico.  The three primary actors - Brolin, Bardem, and Jones - are each excellent.  I expect that we will see a lot more of Brolin.  This movie is not for everyone, but for those looking for a great movie with great acting, I highly recommend this 4 star film.</p></body></html>

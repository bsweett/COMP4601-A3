<meta name="summary" content="Best of 2010 Series: BLACK SWAN"></head><body><p>Darren Aronofsky never fails to provoke audiences. From his 1998 film debut, Pi, to his powerful sophomore feature, Requiem for a Dream, it was clear from the start that Aronofsky was a serious filmmaker, willing to take his audiences to places they would rather not go, in order to reveal a specific truth. To this day, his films are extremely cerebral and unflinching. While Black Swan is a change of pace for Aronofsky, it is no less brutal than any of his previous works.<br /><br />Black Swan is a dark fairy tale and a psychological thriller, as well as a cautionary tale about the pursuit of artistic perfection. Natalie Portman steals the show as Nina Sairs, a young, ambitious dancer at a prestigious academy, who has just been chosen for the dual role of the White and Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. While Nina's virginal innocence lends itself to the role of the White Swan, her instructor, the womanizing Leroy, insists that she will have to "lose herself" in order to accurately represent the openly sensual nature of the Black Swan. Suddenly, Nina begins to face corruption at every turn, coupled with what can only be described as a mental unraveling. The line between dreams and reality becomes horrifyingly blurred, as Nina tries to "find" her Black Swan.<br /><br />From the very start of the film, you feel for Nina Sairs. Natalie Portman's portrayal is a perfect balance of na?vet&eacute; and blossoming sexuality. Her transformation is heartbreaking and powerful, and by the time the credits roll, you will be speechless. This is Portman's best performance to date, for which she won an Oscar this year.<br /><br />Black Swan is a film that will swallow you whole; unfortunately, Aronofsky has included two indulgent, unnecessarily graphic sexual scenes in this otherwise flawless film. Granted, sexuality is a major theme in this film and serves the story in its own right, but there is something to be said for subtlety. The two scenes in question seem as though they were added for mere shock value alone, and in these instances, art becomes exploitation. With that being said, while I believe that Black Swan is one of the best films of the year, I must recommend it with caution. If you are easily offended, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Featuring amazing performances from all involved, including Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder, and Mila Kunis, as well as an incredible Barbara Hershey as Nina's unstable and controlling mother, this is a film that demands to be seen, and is Aronofsky's best film since The Fountain.<br /><br />Black Swan is 108 minutes, and is rated R for strong sexual content, disturbing violent images, language, and some drug use. Released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Directed by Darren Aronofsky.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Results To Formulaic Storytelling, But This Film Is Touching & Well Made"></head><body><p>MOVIE: "It's too soon! Too soon!" Those have been the outcries from almost everybody about Oliver Stone's World Trade Center. It was accussed of trying to exploit the event of profits, and basically people were just being people and were just speaking off the tip of their tongues. Well, the movie was really good. It's what you would expect from a historical picture, unfortunetly for us this event is pretty recent in our history. We watch WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan, Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now, and all other war movies and the difference is that most people did not experience it first hand. Everyone here in the United States watched the towers fall, live, on their televisons. We watched them replay the footage over and over. So, a film of this nature is not too soon, it just has to be handled carefully. Oliver Stone made a great film, a film that celebrated the courage and will to survive rather than the actual terror of the situation. United 93 was a raw and very frightening experience, unlike this film. The only problem with the film is that in telling the tale you'll have to resort to old fashioned cliches. We know what happens at the end, and the story itself is no different than any other survival story. Just the fact that these people experienced it 5 years ago makes the difference and makes it unique. This movie is more of a tribute film rather than a piece of entertainment, no extraordinary cinematography or score, just a heartfelt and emotional story.<br /><br />ACTING: Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena display some fine acting as they take on the roles of two port authority police officers trapped in the rubble. It's hard to convey raw emotion when for the majority of the film has you trapped under concrete, but they really get in the state of mind. The acting is very excellent.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A decent tribute that unfortunetly just doesn't exceed as a film.</p></body></html>

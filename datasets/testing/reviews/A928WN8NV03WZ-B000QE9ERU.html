The Dolph Lundgren version was popular only for its campy aspects and unrealistic gunfights.  This is a movie close to the early and middle eras of the comic book.  It is dark, gritty, ugly at times, and witha  joyless obsessed main character.  The thing that set apart the Punisher from other Marvel heroes is his lack of morals when dealing with evil.  With Daredevil he came from a dark place but had a code to never kill.  Spiderman, though scarred at a young age, still kept his hope and wouldn't kill.  Punisher went through his traumatic experience, and came out as a killer.  Not a man of justice, but a punisher of evil.<br /><br />Frank Castle is an FBI agent in this movie version.  He is involved as an undercover agent in a weapons scheme playing a german with connection to interested foreign parties.  Things seem to go off without a hitch until the foreign parties get nervous when the police show up and open fire on the American dealers, one of them is killed.  The only problem is that the person killed is connected.  His father is Howard Saint, a crime boss focused on money laundering.  He and his wife are crushed by the death his son, and he wants revenge, the wife wants the entire family killed.  So they send a group of hitmen that accomplish this task, save for Frank Castle, who manages to survive and swears revenge.<br /><br />This isn't the typical comic book movie.  The theme is a lot darker than most.  Though he has a trio of nutty neighbors in the trashy apartment he rents, the feeling of the movie is joyless and bleak.  The Saints live in their luxurious mansion but don't seem in the slightest bit happy.  Howard Saint is in luxury but jealously guards everything he has and sufferes from mild paranoia.  His wife seems to make the best out of it but lives under her husbands constant scrutiny.  His son is a fop and not the favorite who was killed.  His neighbors though quirky and friendly seem to be either down on their luck or are losers.  The gun fights aren't John Woo style action sequences, they are quick and ugly executions.<br /><br />But the movie does keep the feel of a comic book.  The two assasins are gimic light, but could easily be in a comic.  The first a blues singer/assasin.  The second the russian, played by a former pro wrestler, a massive assasin that beats his victims to death and has a massive tolerence to pain.  But that is as close to other comics as it got.  Early on it had cameos by superheroes and villians, but middle and later era was flat out standard fare villians; gangsters, drug dealers, terrorists, etc....<br /><br />The acting is good all around.  Frank Castle is downplayed and intense as he was in the comic.  John Travolta was excellent as Howard Saint.  A powerful man that in the center is very weak and insecure.  Willing to kill close friends out of jealousy with little or weak evidence.  His wife Livia Saint, a spoiled woman making the best of her rich cage and possesive husband, but the perfect American aristocrat, arrogant, mean spirited, and looking down at all those around her.<br /><br />This is a very decent movie, better than some of the comic adaptations of late.  Don't expect a happy movie or something with an upbeat ending.  Even when all the bad guys are killed there is a feeling that nothing has changed.  Yes he punished the guilty, but he has nothing in the end.  Family is gone, friends are gone, even money means nothing to him.  But still creates a good movie, albeit dark and having little in the realms of hope.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="outsiders"></head><body><p>A well-received film in which two cynical teenagers, having just graduated from high school, spend a summer casting sarcasm and disdain over the superficiality and expectations of them. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who make fun of things, play pranks and approach everything with a condescending eye. Having planned to move into an apartment together, their plans immediately face obstacles. Rebecca gets a job and starts to conform to a lifestyle Enid wants no part of. Rebecca matures and sees the reality of needing money to live independently, while Enid wants to linger in this adolescent-aimless-loser phase (ruining all her job possibilities almost as soon as they start). One of her pranks leads her to meet Seymour (Steve Buscemi) a middle-aged loser of sorts whose one passion in life is collecting rare records. Perhaps because they each personify the loner-loser stereotype so well, Enid and Seymour are drawn together. Other reviewers have quite thoroughly covered Enid's attitude, her wasted intelligence and self-destructive nature, and certainly provide a glowing recommendation for this film, which my review only supports.</p></body></html>

Hellboy never caught by immediate attention when it first came out. I didn't watch the movie until the sequel was released on DVD. Now was the movie worth watching when it first came out in theaters...Well...Yeah, this is a very different and unique comic book adaptation. The visual effects are stupendous; and the action is non stop.<br /><br />The movie explains briefly the origins of Hellboy. It all begins in 1944 with Professor Trevor Bruttenholm and a group of soldiers. They are sent out to Scotland to stop German Nazis from opening a portal to another world. In the process of course something comes out from the other world, and obviously that is our protagonist Hellboy.  Later in 2004,someone has returned to open the portal and unleash hell...how nice right?<br /><br />I give credit to the movie for being very original and fresh. The effects are superb through the majority of the film. Guillermo Del Torro has managed to adapt a very clever movie that gives you laughs, drama, horror, and an understanding of a hero who has been out casted from the real world. This is well worth owning, especially on the 3 disc directors cut, which contains hundreds of special features and runs 10 min longer than the theatrical cut.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

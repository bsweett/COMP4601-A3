<meta name="summary" content="Not just a brilliant teen film"></head><body><p>There was an abundance of teen films in the 1980s.  That was one of the defining parts of the decade.  Though many of those were great - and many were terrible - few came close to the greatness of THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Since its release in 1985, it has become a contemporary classic, winning over viewers for more than twenty years.  As of yesterday, I am one of the countless viewers in love with this film.<br /><br />THE BREAKFAST CLUB spans eight hours on a grey Saturday, where five teenagers are gathering at Shermer High School for detention.  At first glance, this is how they appear: Andy (Emilio Estevez) is just another jock.  Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is a nerd, a brain, a geek.  Bender (Judd Nelson) is a rude, rambunctious troublemaker.  Claire (Molly Ringwald) is a stuck-up rich girl.  Allison (Ally Sheedy) is odd, quiet, disturbed, the precursor to the Gothic girl.  These five kids go into Shermer High with nothing in common, but when they come out, their lives will be changed forever.<br /><br />John Hughes is universally acknowledged to be the King of Teen Movies, but he's much more.  He is a very talented writer and director, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is clear, undeniable evidence of this.  The script is very likely one of the greatest ever written, filled with great dialogue including memorable moments of humor and shocking moments of drama.  Hughes' directing wrings out Academy Award-worthy performances from the cast - which is, of course, stellar.  Hall is probably the most likable of the bunch, but Nelson is the most amusing.  His character is one whom we hate, then laugh with, then sympathize with, then hate again, and finally, love.  Sheedy's character is delightfully weird.  Paul Gleason is perfectly hateable as Principal Vernon, and John Kapelos is perfectly likable as Carl the janitor.<br /><br />THE BREAKFAST CLUB is emotional, shocking, and filled with dialogue that is undeniably true.  The cast is great, the script is brilliant, the directing is top-notch, the editing is seamless, and to top it off there's a great soundtrack including music by Simple Minds and Wang Chung.  This is not only the ultimate 80s teen flick - it may very well be one of the greatest films ever made.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

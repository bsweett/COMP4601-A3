<meta name="summary" content="Am I just bitter or was the film genuinely bad?"></head><body><p>Brian de Palma probably has one of the most frustrating filmographies I've seen. Sure he has Scarface, Carrie, the Untouchables and the successful Mission:Impossible but then again he has Snake Eyes which fell apart after 20 minutes, Mission to Mars and let's not forget the Bonfire of the Vanities. The Black Dahlia's story, setting and mood seem perfect de Palma yet the film feels so lifeless, incoherent and even at times unintentionally funny. The actual murder case was shocking and incredibly disturbing but here it almost seems like the backdrop for the "real" issue which is basically nothing interesting.<br /><br />2  L.A cops, Bleichart and Blanchard, are tracking down a criminal but as they're dealing with it, a grisly discovery is found in the park: a young woman has been cut in half, drained of blood and organs moved with one last touch: her mouth has been extended ear to ear, forming an eerie grin. Elizabeth Short, nicknamed the Black Dahlia by the press, is still one of the most famous unsolved murders in California history so you would think that much attention would be paid to this but instead we focus on a fixation with someone who did a terrible thing to Blanchard's woman Kay while Bleichart gets involved with a Elizabeth look-alike.<br /><br />On more than one occasion I kept thinking they bring up the case and the woman simply because they realized that they were making a movie called the Black Dahlia so they had to mention the case and show one of the cop's obsession with solving it. It's really a shame since author James Ellroy's other novel, L.A Confidential, was a great film while this just feels a mess from start to finish. Worse still is the acting where normally good actors just seem completely off and almost unsure of the performances. The only one that even comes off as a bit good is Josh Hartnett who has what I call the "William Hurt syndrome", named since both actors can be good but their mannerisms or voice suggest they sound bored. The other notable is the L Word's Mia Kirshner, playing Smart in test screening footage and an old movie. That piercing stare she has creates a memorable character that you never even met in the film.<br /><br />Now there's at least a couple of trademark "de Palma"-isms throughout the film including an awesome crane shot that starts off the whole Dahlia case and a scene involving the staircase feels vintage for him but the rest of the film suggests either he's totally awful now and even the fact he made Scarface won't save him now, or simply the often used "the studio made me do it". Unlike James Cameron's underperforming-but-underrated the Abyss, especially the director's cut, this just feels completely off.<br /><br />Is this just a rough patch and he'll get better or is he just bad now. Beats me, but this certainly wasn't a strong case that he can still deliver. Too bad.</p></body></html>

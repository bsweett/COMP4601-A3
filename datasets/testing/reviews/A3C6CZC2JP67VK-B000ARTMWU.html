<meta name="summary" content="Aja gave us a graphic and brutal film without any remorse."></head><body><p>Alexandre Aja takes us to a roller-coaster of horror in a movie that lives up to its name. "Haute Tension" keeps the tension to the max as we see a return to the visceral gory violence without being vulgar or void exploitation. In fact, the film manages to hold a perfect equilibrium between the elegance and beauty of French film-making and brutal grim horror of movies like Hooper's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".<br /><br />C&eacute;cile De France plays Marie, who is visiting her college friend Alexia (Ma?wenn Le Besco) in rural France. The day she arrives, a mysterious man appears on an old rusty truck and brutally begins to murder Alexia's family. Marie becomes the last hope for Alexia to survive the brutal killings. Great moments of suspense and tension are built, as the fantastic performance of C&eacute;cile grabs the attention of the public; she really owns the screen and is a perfect match for Philippe Nahon, as the ruthless killer.<br /><br />The most recognizable thing about this movie is how strong the violence is. It is really a movie that will impress people with its graphic violence. The make-up and SFX are great and very realistic. While some killings are clich&eacute;d, others are very surprising. Nevertheless, even when it seems that is gory just for the sake of being gory, the camera-work gives images of complete beauty in the composition of the scene. The colors are so well handled that at times the movie gives the impression of being a horrifying canvas. There aren't that many killings in the film (only 5 and one isn't shown) but they are BLOODY!! Not just a little blood here and there...this film throws BUCKETS at the viewer. It's more than a little disturbing and this film has no humor in it. It has a grim, dark tone from the very beginning and never lets up.<br /><br /> The plot is quite simple, not everything is perfect, and I have to say again that the scrip is probably its big flaw. The glaring plot holes are big enough to keep you thinking about them, something writers should avoid like the plague. Nevertheless, Aja's execution will keep you on the edge of the seat and probably, asking for more. While many things have been written about the ending, I thought it was a fitting and (although unoriginal) ending to the brutal trip, since probably is not the ending what matters, but the way Aja takes us to it. In the end, a movie that stays true to the most brutal school of horror, and yet it still delivers more than the typical slasher. A must-see for horror fans, but be warned...this is some strong stuff.</p></body></html>

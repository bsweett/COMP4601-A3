<meta name="summary" content="Unusually Great Movie"></head><body><p>Before the dime drops (or should I say the cup of coffee) at the end of the film, I felt that I had already seen a great movie. And then we find out the significance of the name of the manufacturer of bulletin boards. By the time the last word of the film was spoken, my jaw dropped in amazement. This is an extraordinary film. A film that asks the old question: How can we be sure about the truth of anything? Are things true because we simply believe the teller, who might be a consummate liar? Or do we believe the teller because he tells us what we want to hear? <p>I'm going to stop there because this is not an artsy, philosophical film. This is a suspenseful, action-packed, and strangely-funny movie that has as a PLOT DEVICE our susceptibility to believe what we want to belive--it is not the THEME of the movie. And what a plot device! I can't say any more without giving the story away. <p>So I'll go on to the performances. Yes, Kevin Spacey is great, and all that Academy Award worthiness stuff. But the other actors were overlooked, at least by the critics. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin all do a great job, but Benicio Del Toro's role as Fenster is nothing less than a tour de force! Pete Postlethwaite turns in his standard excellence. Rouding out the cast are the always surprising Dan Hedaya and Giancarlo Esposito--two actors that I think deserve better recognition than they've gotten so far.<p>Behind it all is an unbelieveably tight script and Bryan Singer's masterful direction. This is a must see movie for lovers of crime, action, mystery films, and a must see for anyone who enjoys the type of rare film that is well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, which is something that is not usual for movies today.</p></body></html>

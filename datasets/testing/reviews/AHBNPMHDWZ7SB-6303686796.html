<meta name="summary" content="We All Have a Little Bickle In Us"></head><body><p>The first time I watched and reviewed Taxi Driver, I didn't like it so much. I think I may have given it a 4/10, or something. Fastforward to today, the release day of the 35th Anniversary Blu-ray, and viola. I bought it, knowing how much I didn't like it before. I was willing to pay money for something I knew I didn't like, just to give it a second shot. So anyway, I rewatched it, and I actually got much more out of it the second time. Admittedly, I'll need to watch it again a third time (with Director Marty Scorsese and Writer Paul Schrader's 1986 Criterion Commentary) to fully understand what happened in Travis Bickle's (played to perfection by one of film history's greatest assets, Robert De Niro) mind. I mean, we all have our good times, and bad. Everybody has issues, and many people hate the scum that can be found on inner city streets late at night. Not many let it bother them so much that they go damn near insane and kill people. I know I'll catch a little flack for this statement because these films are held in such contrasting regards, but this story reminded me of Kick-Ass (or vice versa). A guy gets fed up, and fights crime, etc. So I will need to watch it a third time to fully grasp it, but even so, I recognize quality when I see it. This film deserves to be considered one of the greatest American works of art. Hats off to Scorsese, De Niro, Bernard Herrmann for the magnificent score, and most of all the scribe who penned the screenplay, Paul Schrader. My score may seem a bit low for all the praise I'm giving this film, but keep in mind that I didn't like it when I first saw it, so that score is quite a leap. Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

If you take some of the great plots of the last 40-50 years and use today's technology, liberal attutudes toward sex, violence and heck, reality, don't you come up with a better product? Look at Double Indemnity and then see Body Heat. Kathleen Turner just scorches Barbara Stanwyck. The answer is absolutely.<br /><br />Yet we all know of some flops where great technology and acting couldn't carry the show. And this is certainly one of them.<br /><br />First of all, Meryl streep is fantastic. You might have only expected that but still beautiful, powerful, manipulative, evil, sexy . . . she plays it to the hilt. And Denzel also does marvels with what he has to work with. Laurence Harvey was more sympathetic-creepy as Sergeant Raymond Shaw but Liev Shrieber does a credible job.<br /><br />That's it. The plot is so convoluted that by the end, you have no idea of what's going on. Holy Cow it was an incredible (as in virtually unbelievable) story (Richard Condon) to begin with but Sinatra (I never thought I'd say this) and Harvey and Janet Leigh gave us a road to follow and we did. Here, by hour number 2, Meryl Streep's having conversations with people that I suppose I'm supposed to understand play a significant role but I can't figure out what it is. Or who they are. I thought they were Republican members of the Senate! And the Oedipal thing. Come on. A little over the top. Really pandering.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. If you see Manchurian, rent the first one. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark Water"></head><body><p>Dahlia (Connelly) and her daughter Ceci (Grade) have just moved into a ninth-floor apartment on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia is in the midst of a custody battle, and the apartment is very close to one of the best schools in the New York City area.  It is also very affordable, and that is not surprising given how gloomy the place looks.  Kyle (Scott), her ex, wants sole custody since he believes Dahlia is an unfit mother.<br /><br />The only problem with the apartment is a leak in the ceiling dripping black water.  The handyman won't fix it and Dalhia wonders why.  At the same time Ceci makes an imaginary friend who may not be as imaginary as she seems.  And the water keeps dripping...<br /><br />"Dark Water" is more of a thriller than a horror movie, despite what the previews may want you to believe.  If you go into it expecting horror, you will probably be disappointed, and that would be a shame.  "Dark Water" is a smart movie whose twists and turns make sense and follow from what has gone before.  Jennifer Connelly is solid as the mom who just wants what is best for her daughter, but has issues of her own to deal with.  The supporting cast of John C. Reilly and Pete Postlethwaite as the apartment manager and handyman respectively deliver excellent smaller performances.  "Dark Water" is a good thriller and is worth checking out.</p></body></html>

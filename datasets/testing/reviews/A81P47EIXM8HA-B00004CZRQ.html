<meta name="summary" content="a REVIEW from an OWNER of the new BLU RAY set!!"></head><body><p>WOW...this is what a great...GREAT blu ray issue should be.  This two disc set features much to enjoy. Both the original theatrical version and extended versions are here and look ..well ridiculously good, better than they ever did and the note included from Director William Friedkin speaks to that work. The NEW bonus features are really truly the mother lode...containing not only new interviews with the main contributors in front of and behind the camera but loads of exciting behind the scenes footage showing just how all these incredible effects and make up etc were achieved. This is housed in a classy book with great photos and bios and all for about $25 ...I would say that THIS is a prime example of a 5 star movie and a 5 star DVD/Blu Ray presentation. OH...and they DID carry over the excellent British documentary and bonus interviews from the 25th anniversary edition....too  many blu rays are dropping the existing supplements and I am very happy to say if you buy this set you will be able to get rid of BOTH the previous editions.<br /><br />This was a landmark film and this is a definitive and spectacular presentation!!!  As a purchaser of thousands of DVDs and Blu Rays I can say this is in the top 10 for all categories from content, quality ,  packaging and price.</p></body></html>

I remember that news article very clearly.  From one standpoint, that could mean that they acknowledge that NO  Indy film could ever live up the the nearly 20 years of pent-up expectation.  But I truly believe they asked us to lower our expectations because they knew they had a cinematic turd on their hands.<br /><br />It was widely reported for years that Spielberg and Ford were opposed to Lucas' vision of a fourth Indy film featuring extraterrestrials.  Other ideas and treatments came and went over the years too, but finally George wore everybody down and masterminded this abomination of a sequel.  I guess Spielberg and Ford realized that the clock was ticking and it was either do it George's way or don't do it at all.<br /><br />Lazy script, stiff and wooden performances, lack of real suspense, ridiculously absurd action set-pieces, lapses in logic..... everything adds up to a high-budget film that was made simply for the point of making it.<br /><br />Add a few Playboy Playmates to it and it could be an Andy Sidaris film.<br /><br />I'm sure the DVD release has some bells and whistles included, but for the sake of all that is cinematically holy, do NOT buy this film.  Rent it if you simply MUST see it once in a while, but don't buy it.  If this DVD release makes a lot of money, it'll just encourage Lucas to make more bad movies.</p></body></html>

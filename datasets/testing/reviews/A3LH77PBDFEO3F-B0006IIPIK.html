<meta name="summary" content="Warm Homage to serial sci-fi"></head><body><p>As a kid in the '60s, I used to watch the old sci-fi serials from my parents childhoods. Buck Rogers Flash Gordon etc, they were hokey even by that time, but still a lot of fun.<br /><br />This week I had some time to kill, so I put in my DVD of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)</a> and like those old serials it was fun, and corny, but unlike those old movie shorts it has Angelina Jolie, and Gwyneth Paltro (playing strong women), and some very cool CG animations that the old movies couldn't even imagine.<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is not what we expect in modern sci-fi, but if you are in the mood for something fun with some old time flavor, Sky Captain should do just fine!</p></body></html>

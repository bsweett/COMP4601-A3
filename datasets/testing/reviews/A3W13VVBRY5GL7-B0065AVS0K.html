<meta name="summary" content="Not good"></head><body><p>The first and most important element of any decent Sci-Fi/Action movie is a good script with strong characterisation, plausible dialogue and a believable motivation behind the lead characters. Without these, the film invariably descends into a campy parody of itself, and that is precisely what's happened here.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how closely this movie sticks to the comics that spawned it - when you move to a different medium you need to make changes to reflect the move (like the cut-down character backgrounds in the X-Men movies, or the plot tweaking and omission in the Harry Potter series - two extremely successful sci-fi/literary adaptation franchises), and sadly, 'Sin City' seems to think it can get away with having the actors spout the same kinds of dialogue as they do in the comics.<br /><br />This doesn't work for several reasons. On the printed page, we need to have things spelled out for us that comic art - particularly the kind of comic art contained in the Sin City books, a hugely graphical and stylised look - can't capture. Character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - all of these are things that comics more often than not need to have as printed text, and in the comic book medium, this works. On film, these things - character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - are all possible to achieve with visuals - facial expressions, body language, montage sequences, and so forth. The movie of 'Sin City' has its first major failing, then, in that the characters - grim and gritty men and women of action and consequence - wax lyrical over themselves, their current situations, and their previous histories - until they end up sounding like pedantic Drama majors about to embark on their first audition. The Valkyrie speech? The White Light line? The entire opening monologue? Three of the most horrendous offenders that are so full of their own self-importance that it makes the rest of the script surrounding them pale into mundanity - which isn't too much of a problem since it was all pretty mundane to begin with.<br /><br />The second problem with 'Sin City' is the amateurish use of spot colours, here and there, to suggest a tie to the excellent style of the comic books. 'Schindler's List' used this ploy to great effect, but sadly, here it just looks overdone. Not that this is a bad idea in theory, but thanks to some pedestrian direction (particularly in the first and second stories) it seems to be there just for the sake of it, as opposed to highlighting anything actually important. Case in point: the blue eyes of the young hooker in the second plot are just annoying because there aren't enough worthwhile close-ups of her face to make the colour stand out. It becomes a mere annoyance noticing these small splashes of colour against, it must be said, an overall rather effective visual style of high-contrast black and white areas.<br /><br />Direction is run-of-the-mill action fare.<br /><br />Performances are forced and difficult, particularly the action movie veterans like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. It can't be much fun having to deal with such clunky dialogue as this. They do their best but sadly, as is the case with the more traditionally artistic actors like Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, fail to deliver the mawkish, over-the-top lines with anything other than palpable disbelief.<br /><br />Two stars for a brave attempt is all I can award this movie, such a potential wasted and with such a horrible, forced script, it's lucky to get even that. Pick up the comics instead, they're far more rewarding and not half as annoying.</p></body></html>

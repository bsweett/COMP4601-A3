It's easy.  If you are expecting a<br /><br />Stone classic such as Platoon, Wall Street, Talk<br /><br />Radio, Born on the Fourth of July, The Doors, or<br /><br />Natural Born Killers, you will be extremely<br /><br />disappointed.<br /><br />Granted, Kilmer, Jolie, Hopkins and Farrell turn in<br /><br />outstanding acting performances, and Vangelis provides<br /><br />a beautifully haunting and bold soundtrack, but<br /><br />"Alexander" loses his "balls" (if I may boldly state)<br /><br />when the "truth" behind this "great" is suddenly<br /><br />exposed with blatant and eplicit scenes of taking a<br /><br />piece of bread and buttering it on both sides...if you<br /><br />get my drift.<br /><br />Not being an historian, nor an astute pupil of ancient<br /><br />history (I'd never make it on "Jeopardy"), I did not<br /><br />realize (nor did my lady) that Alexander the Great was<br /><br />bi-sexual.  By no means do I object to anyone's sexual<br /><br />preference, but I was totally taken by surprise to<br /><br />discover (ON THE SCREEN...IN LIVING COLOR) that<br /><br />Alexander's true love was a man.<br /><br />During the first of several love scenes (some<br /><br />subtle...one blatant) with each other, a family got up<br /><br />and left the theatre.  I applaud the parents for that<br /><br />wise move.<br /><br />What could have been a great film simply rubbed me the<br /><br />wrong way (no pun intended).  I suppose there will be<br /><br />those that will praise this film for its boldness and<br /><br />daring recreation of history, but it simply turned me<br /><br />off.  If you are a movie buff (like me), it is<br /><br />definitely a film you must see for its editing,<br /><br />incredible aerial scenes through the eyes (and wings)<br /><br />of a hawk...and the acting, specifically, from Kilmer,<br /><br />Jolie and Farrell.<br /><br />Jolie and Kilmer are portrayed as Alexander's parents.<br /><br />  Both are dysfunctional and abusive.  She hates<br /><br />men...he hates women...and together they struggle for<br /><br />power in Babylon.  Murder, revenge, love, obsession<br /><br />and greed play a huge role in this flick.<br /><br />The most memorbale scene is a jungle battle in<br /><br />India...with Alexander and his faithful horse braving<br /><br />the tribal troops riding massive elephants and donning<br /><br />blankets of steel.<br /><br />The most touching moment comes from Farrell when his<br /><br />father is murdered...a scene one will never forget.<br /><br />If this sounds like a movie you want to see, then<br /><br />don't miss the first 30 minutes.  Listen closely.<br /><br />There is an abundance of "words of wisdom" that is<br /><br />played out in nearly every scene for the following 2<br /><br />1/2 hours.<br /><br />If you can look beyond the love relationships between<br /><br />men and men, you'd give it a 4 or 5 on a 5-star scale.  I give it a 3 for the acting performances, editing and soundtrack.  If there are 5 stars in the film, it is definitely Vangelis' stunning soundtrack.</p></body></html>

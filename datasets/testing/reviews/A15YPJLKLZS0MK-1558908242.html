<meta name="summary" content="The Movie of the 90s"></head><body><p>This is THE movie that made the 90s the 90s. Featuring drug use, sexual situations and nudity, this is the film that made Quentin Tarentino the big international star that he is today. Billed as Italian, though I'm pretty sure he's french Italian, it was a big hit in America and has a devoted cult following today. Recommended for fans of true crime and drama, pulp delivers as it's sexier than porn because it serves to merely titillate. Some hailed it as a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

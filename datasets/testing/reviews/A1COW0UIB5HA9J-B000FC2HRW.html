<meta name="summary" content="The weakest of the trilogy but still a fine installment and a Awesome DVD."></head><body><p>One night at the graduation part at a local amusement park, Wendy (Mary-Elizabeth Winstead) and her friends are having a great time until they decide to go on this roller-coaster ride. Wendy secretly has a special gift, she can predict what bad things can come especially a horrific vision of themselves dying on a roller-coaster ride accident but after that vision she warns her friends not to go on it as they follow her advice then it really starts happening. After that ordeal, her friend Kevin (Ryan Merriman) belives in her and must try to find some clues on pictures she took at the carnival as she believes death is coming for her friends and must save them or else deah himself will preveal.<br /><br />Easily the weakest of the three FD movies but there is some suprisingly and ghastly moments of gory accidents such as for example the head crushing sequence in the gym which will remind you of that one from "The Toxic Avenger" and one sequence that will make you never wanna go to the tanning booth again. There are some cute girls in this movie even though they maybe slaughtered by the grim reaper himself, James Wong (creator of the series) returns as director and producer. It's not as good as the first two movies but it does have some cool and violent moments with some sexy girls, it's worth watching if your into horror and gore.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray both the theatrical version and a way cool "Choose their fate" version where during the movie on some scenes you can change the course of the film with alternate scenes and the character's fate. The extras includie a documentary, a feature about the "Dead Teen" subgenre, audio commentary, Trailers, TV Spots, an animated short, Extended Police Station sequence, and "Planned Accidents: a look on the set of FD3". The Picture is very decent and the sound is good but not great as it sounds the same as the DVD.</p></body></html>

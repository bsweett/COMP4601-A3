<meta name="summary" content="Classic action/adventure film...and great filmmaking"></head><body><p>Say what you will about Steven Spielberg, but a lesser filmmaker would have been far less gutsy about this film. <p>Can you imagine a film being made today about a killer shark...and having the filmmaker resolutely  refuse to show you the shark until the film was 2/3 done?<p>That's what  makes &quot;Jaws&quot; so effective - we don't know anything about the  shark at all. It's a complete mystery. That makes it a true protagonist in  a dramatic sense...and a great counterpoint to today's action films, in  which silly one-liners and overacting count as great villainy.<p>It shows  great faith in the intelligence of the moviegoer on Spielberg's  part.<p>&quot;Jaws&quot; has other charms as well. The performances are  excellent, especially Robert Shaw's turn as the crusty, slightly crazy and  ultimately very likeable Quint. The scene in which he describes his  experience with the sinking of the USS Indianapolis is absolutely  riveting.<p>The John Williams score is a classic, and it's a tribute to the  craft of the filmmakers that very few of the film's special effects  (including the shark) look the least bit dated today.<p>All in all, this is  a classic, but I don't need to tell you that...you've probably already seen  it a few dozen times yourself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Memorable Only for Sir Ian McKellen's Excellent Acting"></head><body><p>`Lukewarm' is the word to describe the latest collaboration of Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. Even the avid fans of the actor would admit `The Da Vinci Code' is not his best movie, turgid and bloated, far cry from the thrills of `Apollo 13.' Whatever the sin the film committed, it is not about the religious content of the original book that caused some controversy because the film, knowing the risk they are running, avoids offering the definite solution to the `code.' That's OK, I understand. But if the film fails to entertain us as thriller, mystery, or whatever it is, that's something I cannot forgive<br /><br />The extraordinary plot of the book is brought to the screen, and it became more impossible, even ridiculous at times. The murder of a curator in Louvre brings two principal characters Prof. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveau (Audrey Tautou) to the museum. They are so clever that they can crack the elaborate codes left on the crime scene within ten minutes. but what is the fun of watching the mystery solved so easily? Or what kind of a murder victim can think of leaving such elaborated message while he is dying?<br /><br />[SAVED BY A PIGEON] From the weak beginning, the film never gets better. There is a brief, unexciting car chase in the Paris streets (by Audrey Tautou's cryptologist ... do you believe that?). The `bad' guys are represented by Silas, fanatical believer and assassin played by over-the-top Paul Bettany, and Bishop Aringarosa, miscast Alfred Molina. When the professor is in danger, he is miraculously saved by a pigeon. But Tom Hanks seems comfortable with this unbelievable situation, even with his terrible haircut.<br /><br />But what is most shocking to me is the disappointing acting from two French actors - Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno. You don't find the charming Amelie or Mathilde, or the super-cool Leon. They are surely doing their best, but clearly they are not comfortable with the roles they are playing, knowing that they should be doing films with Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Luc Besson.<br /><br />The only winner in the film is Ian McKellen, whose witty and amusing acting as eccentric Sir Leigh Teabing, suddenly lights up the imagination of the cardboard characters that peopled the film, and makes them more tolerably human. Tom Hanks seems enjoying acting with him, and even willing to let him steal the scenes.<br /><br />After all, `The Da Vinci Code' is not as bad as you might be led to believe. It is gorgeous to see, and as I said, there is Ian McKellen's delightful performance. But the overlong film does not offer the thrills of encoding and decoding; it only gives us bits of mediocre mystery, bits of familiar family drama, and not-so-fresh conspiracy theory. And it works as none of them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent entertainment!  A superb gangster flick."></head><body><p>&quot;Casino&quot; features much of the same cast as the excellent film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; with Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro returning as gangsters, this time in Las Vegas.  This is the story of a mob-fronted casino boss and the local Mafia enforcer in Vegas.  The film truly takes us inside the seamier side of 1960s Las Vegas, which at that time was more or less openly controlled by the Midwestern mob bosses.  The film is practically a psueudo-documentary about how the mob ran Vegas.<p>Pesci and DeNiro turn in fine performances as enforcer and casino boss respectively.  James Woods does his customary excellent job as the worthless dissolute, but controlling boyfriend of De Niro's wife, Ginger.  The standout, however, is Sharon Stone as Ginger.  She literally becomes the role, and ultimately dominates the latter portion of the film.<p>The storyline is brisk, and the explanation of the workings of the Vegas mob are very interesting.  The film shows the ultimate pointlessness and wanton violence of the mob culture, as all of the major players ultimately come to bad ends.  The film never takes itself too seriously, and there are many absolutely hilarious parts to the film.  The sub-plot dealing with De Niro's attempt to get a casino license from the local Vegas good-old-boys is really funny.<p>Minor criticisms.  First of all, the film involves 'way more swearing than is necessary.  Yes, I have no doubt that mobsters really do talk this way, using the F-word every third word, as Pesci does throughout the film.  But it probably would have been OK to clean this up anyway--I think that to have done so would have added to, rather than detracted from, the movie's impact.  The violence throughout the film is such that it is not suitable for young kids.<p>Basically an excellent adult film that retains the viewer's interest, tells an interesting story, and features very fine performances by the cast.  Recommended for what it is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An absolutely intriguing mystery"></head><body><p>I was often recommended Oldboy by loads of people but kept putting it off for some reason. Well, I'm glad I just decided to go 'what the hell' because it IS actually really, really good.<br /><br />Even though the plot has been outlined a zillion times in other reviews, I will simply say that some seemingly random dude is plucked from the streets, imprisoned in a shoddy apartment for 15 years and let loose with a wallet full of money and a cell phone. He has 5 days to find the man who imprisoned him and why.<br /><br />An absorbing set-up and the clues as he slowly finds them and slowly puts them together make for a brilliant mystery movie with a wicked dark sense of humor. The plot has layers and layers of mystery and our hapless hero wades through thick twists and turns, always keeping us on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />There are some brilliant fight scenes and some truly bizarre moments, such as a live octopus being eaten whole. But what really floored me was the ending. I won't tell you a tiny little bit of it. But...wow! As is the case with EVERY SINGLE Asian MOVIE, Oldboy is currently being remade by Hollywood. Because anything that the Asians can do, Hollywood can apparently do better. In my opinion this film really doesn't need a remake as this version is strong enough to appeal to the whole world.<br /><br />Too bad most of the planet are philistines who would rather 'watch' a film than 'read' it. A complaint I hear often enough. If your impression of Asian films is they are all shoddy and not very modern looking then, in the case of Oldboy, you are very much mistaken.<br /><br />Among the many strong points of the movie are the faultless editing and stunning photography. Oldboy is the slickest movie I have seen in a good while and can easily out-gloss anything by Michael Bay.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and check this movie out. If you don't love it then you truly have no business watching films at all. I'll save you time and tell you outright that if you like stuff like Crapper By The Dozen 2 and Miss Congenatiliality 2 then is best you just stick to stuff like that. At the risk of sounding like a pretentious ass, leave the more important films to the brainiacs.<br /><br />The DVD is in immaculate 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen with a brilliant Dolby/DTS 6.1 sound design!</p></body></html>

Well the first few minutes we see a brutal murder but dont expect to see this thru out this movie. The problem with the movie is the actors seem very winded in this film. They do some lines then pause (as if they just ran 10 miles) and then say the next line. The movie was slow at times to say the least. Viggo Mortensen looks cool in this movie but the performance falls flat. Its too bad because it probably would have made the movie better. I still enjoyed it but probably but wont call it a must see or a classic.</p></body></html>

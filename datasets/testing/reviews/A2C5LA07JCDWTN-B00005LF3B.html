The most likely reason is the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis who continues to create quality motion pictures time after time.  Tom Hanks gives one of his stronger performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed-Ex higher-up who gets stranded on a desolate island after his plane crashes.  There is little dialogue during Hanks' time on the island, but it is not needed as Zemeckis tells his story through the camera.  It becomes quite interesting to see the de-evolution of this man as he gets back to primal survival skills.  Castaway is chock full of memorable moments and will stick to your ribs, it is a movie you will not soon forget.</p></body></html>

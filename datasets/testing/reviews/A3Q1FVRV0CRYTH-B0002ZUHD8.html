It's hard to follow in the footsteps of a film like Gladiator and I think that it will be a problem for an epic like this to really hold it's own if you hold it in that light, but if you take it for what it is you will see that this film was a really great one at that.  The performances were strong and that action was spot on, the sequences were thrilling and brutal (especially in this version) but yet it still was flagged as a waste of time.  I thought it was great and think that it's a film most everyone should see...and while it may not be acurate, who are we to say...I mean it's not like anyone really knows for sure.  most people still feel that King Arthur was a myth, and the sword in the stone crap is deffinatly fake so don't dog this film just because it's not what you believe to be truth.  It's still one awsome movie and one cool ride.  Owen is good as Arthur but Knightly is the best one here, she has really proven herself as one kick @$$ actress...I'm rooting for her this year with 'Pride...' she could take home a Globe...</p></body></html>

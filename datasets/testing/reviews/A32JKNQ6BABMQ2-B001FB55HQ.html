<meta name="summary" content="i have few issues with this part"></head><body><p>ever since i was a kid i have loved the terminator movies.i remember back in the early 80s being upset at the idea of never having a terminator 2.i remember in the early 90s,being estatic when they made a second part.i remember in the early part of the 2000s loving the 3rd part.<br />  but there were 2 things i really wanted.the first was to not have to wait a decade in between parts.the second was to see the actual man vs machine war.a whole movie dedicated to just that and not existing only in flashes and memories.<br />  well,here it is!it only took about 5 years,maybe less and the war is on!i really liked this movie a lot.it is not nearly as good as the first 3,but it is definately a good movie.<br />  i didnt like a few things but they are minor.one was that i kept seein john connor as bruce wayne.a silly quirk i know.2 of the main characters looked a lot alike.it confused me a bit.the only real issue i had with the story was the innefficient death camp.<br />  john connor,the best hope for mankind and terminator hater extrordinaire,makes a deal with a terminator.that rubbed me the wrong way.hes supposed to hate them so much.<br />  i also didnt like that arnold swarzanegger was in the movie.he was ranked as the number one enemy against guns in the u.s. .  now the hypocrite plays in a movie full of guns?ive lost all respect for that guy.<br />  the general consensus is that this movie is a let down.i say it is NOT a let down,only not as good as it predecessers.<br /><br />one of the female soldiers kisses a  terminator at the end.if machines get her hot,she couldve just stuck her tongue in a toaster.</p></body></html>

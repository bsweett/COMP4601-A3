This seems to be a movie with an educational and ethical mission about the international situation in arms dealing. It includes the fall of the Soviet Union to conflicts in Africa. Cage goes through his paces as an arms deale, with no real excitement. Cage aquires a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) who uses selective denial, and Ethan Hawk represents the law that is always on his tail. Eamonn Walker does a great job as Andre Baptiste - leader of an African nation who plays Cage's main customers. Walker is great at playing a bad guy.  This film is emotionally cold in that it is told from the viewpoint of someone who caters to cold blooded killers. It is intense at times, some tension and enough action. This movie deals with ethics, however it is not a fun movie. It is not a feel good movie.</p></body></html>

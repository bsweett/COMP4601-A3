<meta name="summary" content="Borat Does America"></head><body><p>Agreed that Americans are very gullible to the next trend. Borat is an example of how hype can make a bad film a success. I thought they tried too hard to be funny. I mean look at the morons he used in the film. Drunken, disgustingly stupid  redneck college guys. Moronic manner-driven southern belles lost in the past. Small minded, gay hating rodeo fans. Annoying, overly serious convention attendees.<br /><br />The part where Borat shows a nude picture of his family to someone has been done in his TV show awhile back. It was funny the 1st time, but seemed tired now.</p></body></html>

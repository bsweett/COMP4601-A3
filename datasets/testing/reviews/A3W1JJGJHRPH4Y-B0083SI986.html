<meta name="summary" content="Clint is a tough, old man."></head><body><p>Walt is a foul-mouthed, bigotted, ex-autoworker, veteran of the Korean war. The movie starts with his wife's funeral. The funeral brings in Walt's estrangement with his family and grandchildren. Walt bemoans that his neighborhood is becoming non-white. What the movie does well is portraying how Walt is brought into a relationship with the Hmong family next door. The movies exposes the bigotry of Walt, but what Walt respects most is character. The kid next door is a doormat, but he show compassion for his neighbor. Tau's sister, is spunky and brave, and Walt learns to respect and like her. Walt gets pulled into their community because they need him and in turn he needs them. Food plays a key role in this movie like it does in most communities.<br /><br />All the acting is superb. The movie is deadly serious, but there are some really funny scenes in the movie. Walt's relationship with his barber is hilarious. The relationship with the old lady next door is funny as well.<br /><br />The continuing dialog between Walt and the persistent priest is very good. Walt dislikes the priest at first, but Walt starts to admire him for his intelligence and compassion.<br /><br />This movie confronts bigotry far better than "Crash" and without all the heavy moralizing and coincidences. This movie gives its characters actual personalities and intelligence not just cariacatures.<br /><br />Clint looks old in the movie, but he creates a very memorable character. The movie has very limited special effects, no flashbacks, and limited conversation. The movie centers mostly on Walt with very few side trips. The movie really works with the sparse direction.</p></body></html>

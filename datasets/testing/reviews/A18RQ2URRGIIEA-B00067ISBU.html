Created by Mike Mignola and first published in 1994 by Dark Horse Comics (which was founded in 1986 by Mike Richardson in Oregon), Hellboy is a red demon that works as a paranormal investigator and fights occult threats for the fictional U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.  As depicted in the 2004 film, Hellboy arrives on Earth under rather unusual circumstances.  A fictionalized version of Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (Karel Roden) did not die during the Russian Revolution.  Instead, he works for the Nazis in the 1940's with the promise of giving them a powerful supernatural means of defeating the Allies.  (The real Rasputin, 1869?-1916, was a Russian mystic and famed occultist for Tsar Nicholas II.) Using strange & sophisticated equipment with the aid of Nazi scientists, Rasputin constructs a machine that can open a doorway into another realm inhabited by long-ago banished beings.  Rasputin succeeds in the opening the doorway just as U.S. troops attack their site.  Rasputin is seemingly killed, but something did come through the mystical doorway: a young, red demon.  Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt), who had traveled with the U.S. troops, finds the young demon and raises it as his own child.  Naming the demon Hellboy, it grows into a large and powerful being (played by Ron Perlman); but instead of becoming an instrument of destruction as envisioned by Rasputin, Hellboy becomes a powerful force for good.  However, not everyone who assisted Rasputin the night that he opened the doorway was killed or captured, including Rasputin's lover Ilsa (Biddy Hodson) and the very dark and bizarre man Karl Ruprect Kroenen (Ladislav Beran).  In present day along with Hellboy at the super-secret Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is the amphibian humanoid ("icthyo sapien") known as Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), but one of the paranormal agents has recently opted to stay in a mental hospital, the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  Professor Bruttenholm selects newbie agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) to become Hellboy's new partner, who takes an interest in getting Liz back to the bureau; which is a good thing since Ilsa and Karl intend to resurrect Rasputin to carry out his evil plans.<br /><br />With a fair bit of acting, a touch of humor, good special effects and an interesting story, "Hellboy" is an entertaining and engaging film. Other memorable characters include Agent Clay (Corey Johnson), the kid on the rooftop (Rory Copus) and the deceased Ivan Klimatovich.  My least favorite character is the head of the bureau, Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor).  Mike Mignola, who was also one of the film's associate producers, played a brief (and uncredited) moment in the film as knight.  The film's director (and co-writer), Guillermo del Toro, also had a brief, uncredited role in the film as a dragon.  Memorable scenes include the Nazis, Myers' arrival, Hellboy's fights, Liz's fire-starting abilities and the closing scenes.  Overall, I rate the 2004 "Hellboy" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

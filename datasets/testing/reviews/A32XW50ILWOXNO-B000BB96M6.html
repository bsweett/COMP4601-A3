<meta name="summary" content="Willy Weirdo..."></head><body><p>"Charlie and Chocolate Factory" is a  expensive, creepy  film. It's perverse on a level kids may not get but does transmit to adults, who might wonder what director Tim Burton, and star Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, are getting at, exactly. It's dark, episodic and surprisingly unfunny, aiming for that demographic that enjoy watching episodes of "Maury" where the bad kids get sent to boot camp to get humiliated and browbeaten.<br /><br />True, the book by Roald Dahl is not exactly a lark: Five children are invited to the reclusive Willy Wonka's massive confection factory after finding golden tickets inside their candy bar wrappers and four of them are ironically punished for their various bad habits.  One impoverished Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is polite and reserved during his visit, and thus rewarded for being the kind of child Dahl preferred: The saint.<br /><br />Played by Highmore as a nice, shy boy, Charlie finds his golden ticket in the third Wonka chocolate bar he buys; he takes his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly in a diminished, useless role) to Wonka's factory just down the road. He's joined by lard German Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled English aristocrat Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and two competitive American punks, Violet Biodegrade (AnnaSophia Robb) and Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry). Gloop is a glutton, and the rest are grabby and annoying. But none of them know what to make of Willy Wonka, played by Depp as if he were channeling...someone very strange.<br /><br />Is it Michael Jackson? Vogue editor Anna Wintour? Jude Law's character in "Artificial Intelligence?" A John Malkovich villain? It's mannered and organic - clearly Depp had to rewrite some of this material toward his characterization - and a rallying point for the bad kids.  These brats don't much like anyone, but they have reason to suspect and loathe Willy.<br /><br /> So when Gloop, Mike, Veruca, Violet get theirs in Burton's vision, their calamities are presented straight away while a bemused, detached, fey Depp looks on in his bob haircut. Burton also cloned one actor (Deep Roy) through CGI for all the Oompa Loompas, whose primary function is to perform dance numbers closely parroting 1970s songs most kids wouldn't know, the lyrics of which zoom by with such speed you don't know what the Oompas are singing about anyway.<br /><br />Burton never really brackets these numbers, or many of the scenes in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." The movie just unfurls, unaware of its own rhythm, unwilling to comment on anything except Willy's childhood (one of those classic Burton deals of a father isolating his son) that doesn't begin to explain Depp's behavior. He's Willy Weirdo, not Wonka, and that the movie made a pile of dough is not a tribute to its quality but marketing and a lack of audience taste.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Natalie Portman Stands Out as Adult Actress"></head><body><p>Natalie Portman is one of those stars who has been with us since she was a child.  The usual scenario is that these child actors are history the minute they become adults.  Some of them, for one, were cute children and are not especially attractive adults yet they are caught in an image business.  Natalie Portman did not have this problem.  She grew into a beautiful woman with her acting skills finely honed as she came into adulthood.  She also studied ballet until she was 12 so this role was especially well suited for her.  I think she may well get the Oscar for it because she is able to inhabit both parts of the swan from Swan Lake, the ballet. When we first meet her she is the virginal, pristine, rigid princess type white swan.  The black swan is the evil swan so she has to bring out a whole other side of herself in order to dance the black swan.  Her sequences onstage as the black swan are some of the very best in the entire film.<br /><br />The plot is very simple and hinges entirely on the Natalie Portman swans.  It is that she starts cracking up as she pushes herself to become both swans.  This going nuts aspect of the movie is a bit over the top. I almost would have preferred a supernatural basis to her becoming the black swan. As we hurtle towards the ending, I'm reminded of the all time weeper of ballet movies, "The Red Shoes." This is not a weeper like that film but they both deal with the passion and obsession of the dance over the dancer.<br /><br />I've always liked Darren Aronofsky's work and this film is no exception. One warning: if you hate ballet, this movie may not be for you.  There are very few moments in the movie where there isn't some aspect of ballet going on.</p></body></html>

And I'd like to think I'm capable of enjoying an artist's work despite their personal meltdowns (which is why I can enjoy a Roman Polanski film).<br /><br />"Apocalypto" starts out promising, by introducing the viewer to a likable Mayan village. (Although even in the beginning, jokes about eating testicles and having to procreate in front of your mother-in-law seem to add an unnecessary crudeness). However, as soon as the village is invaded by the ruling Mayan tribe, the film just descends into an orgy of violence, gore and ugliness that just goes on and on and on.<br /><br />By focusing on the characters and using the violence more sparingly, Gibson could have created a better film. But instead, he just throws as much carnage at the screen as he can. A jaguar rips a man's face off. Decapitated heads bounce off a temple. A huge mass grave of headless corpses attract a barrage of flies. After a while, after being assaulted with the relentlessly grotesque imagery, you just become desensitized to it all. And since the characters are never really developed enough for you to really relate to them, the result is that it all just becomes ... tedious.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Smith does it again!"></head><body><p><p>This movie is like a who's who of Hollywood.  Salma Hayek...Chris Rock...Matt Damon...Ben Affleck...Alanis Morrisette?!? <p>This is the story of two fallen angels (Damon and Affleck) who find a loophole to get into heaven.  But there is one catch.  Doing so will undo existence as we know it.  The last scion is dispatched to save existence and does, with a little help from the 13th apostle (Rock), a muse (Hayek) and 2 unlikely prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). <p>There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  Other than a rather bloody ending, this movie is hysterical.  George Carlin is hilarious as Cardinal Glick and Alanis Morrisette as...well you have to see it to find out!</p></body></html>

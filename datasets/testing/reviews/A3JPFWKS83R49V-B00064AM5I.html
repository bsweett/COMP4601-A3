<meta name="summary" content="Dodge Yourself into a Seat to Watch this Funny Movie"></head><body><p>Dodgeball is a fun and entertaining film that pits two business associates against each other in a battle for respect and survival. Ben Stiller is the egocentric, cocky White Goodman and Vince Vaughan plays his rival, Peter. Both men own physical health centers, but Peter's is in financial trouble and needs a way to make a large sum of money quickly. Peter and his employees decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas with the hope of winning the championship and the necessary money to stay in business. Goodman hears about this and he enters his own team to challenge them.<br /><br />The formula and plot for this movie may seem a little hokey at first. But the movie works for several reasons. First of all, there is the fine cast of characters and diversity of personalities. Vaughn's character is soft spoken and friendly, but also non- expressive and basically an underachiever- the mirror opposite of the arrogant character played by Ben Stiller. Rip Torn is also excellent as the coach for Vaughn's team. His character, Peaches O'Houlihan, is confined to a wheelchair but he doesn't let this stop him from doing what he does best: coaching and motivating his team in a most unorthodox and often hysterical way. And Gary Cole and Jason Bateman add some good laughs as the sportscasters for "ESPN 8: The Ocho", which is covering the dodgeball event.<br /><br />Cameo appearances by Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and others add to the many surprises in this film. And even though the movie is mostly predictable, as a viewer, you really won't mind. There is enough fun along the way to make the ride enjoyable regardless.<br /><br />Dodgeball is, in summary, a fast- moving, fun, entertaining, and mostly predictable film that is humorous and enjoyable from beginning to end. The director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, and the fine cast deserve credit for taking what initially seems like a stupid, "B" comedy and turning it into a compelling, witty, and entertaining motion picture film.</p></body></html>

There were some references to technology (I'm a computer geek) that I thought was pretty funny, especially when it comes to the size of the gadgets used by Starsky and Hutch.<p>This movie does follow the regular buddy-cop recipe where two cops, who can't stand each other and are complete opposites of each other, end up as partners rushing out to fight crime.  While trying to work with each other they find a common bond that allows them to work together as a team.  There is more to the recipe and it makes this film rather predictable at most parts... but there were some parts that surprised me and that also caused me to laugh out loud.<p>Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson do a great job and are a great team.  I believe this will have to be their fifth or sixth movie together.  They are very funny... but the show was stolen by Snoop Dogg who does a fantastic job as Huggy Bear.  He really brought this movie up a notch in its hilarity.<p>If you want a good comedy, especially the kinds of Ben Stiller's calliber, then I would highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

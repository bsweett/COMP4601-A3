<meta name="summary" content="Suspenseful"></head><body><p>This movie has all the perfect elements.  Hitchcock was robably beaming in his grave.  This movie has so many layers.  The moment you THINK you know what this story is about, it changes, and then changes again until the truth astonishes you.  I remember when I saw this movie in the theatre-I was just rivited to the screen.  Catching it on TNT so many years later, it still has the same effect.  The young teen screams don't have the corner market on suspense.  I wish there was more movies like this out there.  Bravo.</p></body></html>

Also, bravo to Matt Damon for not pigeonholing himself into roles but instead flexing his acting versatility every chance he gets.  I just got done watching him as Tina Fey's pilot boyfriend on 30 ROCK and the Texas Ranger in TRUE GRIT.  You would be hard pressed to tell any of these roles were the same actor!<br /><br />This film has an incredible opening, one I can see again and again.  A French female tv broadcaster is on vacation at a beach paradise on the Indian Ocean.  While she is shopping at the stalls, the tsunami which erupted from that ocean in 2004 crashes towards her.  She struggles for her life in the water but a car hits in the water and she dies and starts to cross over.  This, however, is one of those deaths where she is subsequently brought back with life guard techniques.  Yet she now is forever drawn back to that transition point.  Hers is just one of three stories but what a bang up opening to this film.<br /><br />There are two other stories.  Matt Damon is a reluctant psychic located in San Francisco.  He is the real deal unlike just about everyone else in the field.  The reason he doesn't want to do it is that it is absolutely ruinous to one's personal life as it obliterates the distance needed to carry on personal relationships.  It is hard to romance someone when you can see her entire life with just one touch. He has such an encounter with a would-be girlfriend played by Bryce Dallas Howard.<br /><br />Finally, there is a boy who loses his twin brother in a fatal collision.  He desperately wants to get in touch with his brother.  His life is a mess because after his brother's death he is removed from his mother and put into foster care. (Although, one evidently can get far better foster care families in the UK than here in the US.) It was interesting for me to see that the boy uses a computer with internet connection as his lifeline in almost every situation.  The other characters are too old for them to have been raised with a connected computer since earliest childhood.  However, with the newest generation coming up, it as natural as breathing to use it everyday for everything.<br /><br />All three of these people will ultimately come together in London.  This too works very well.  It is just an astonishing piece of filmmaking and I consider it at the very top of Eastwood's directing efforts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Am I the ONLY one who wasn't impressed???"></head><body><p>I vowed some time ago to, once and for all, stopping handing over my time, money and brain cells to sequels, threequels, remakes and franchise.  So since this was the first time IRON MAN was being brought to the big screen, I figured I was safe and would be treated to a good, original superhero movie to follow in the steps of the original Superman, Batman, X-Men and Spiderman.<br /><br />In my (surprised) opinion, no so.  While Robert Downy Jr's acting and spontaneous ability for dialogue and wit never fail to please, the story, for me, fell very short.  If this film is, indeed, based on the original comic book story of Iron Man, then the story failed to impress me.  In this film, it seems you spend more time watching the endless, ongoing process of how his superhero suit is created step-by-step rather than the action and the danger that you crave.  To make matters worse, I felt there were way too many stupid jokes and sight gags inserted into a film that I thought would be much darker, judging by the trailer I'd seen.<br /><br />I'm afraid that IRON MAN gets thrown on the scrap heaps of bad superhero movies like FANTASTIC FOUR.  And Hollywood can rest assured that I will be going nowhere near IRON MAN II, III, IV, etc.</p></body></html>

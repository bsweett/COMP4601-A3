<meta name="summary" content="The classic of all classics!"></head><body><p>This is the movie that you must see!  The drama and intrigue of this classic centers around a man - and his single dying word.  Charles Foster Kane is an incredible character of power and ultimate misery.  If you are a fan of movies at all - you have to experience Citizen Kane.  It simply is the Godfather of all dramas to come.</p></body></html>

Seemingly, studios continue to gamble millions upon millions of dollars that Americans will pay to go to see anything as long as there are explosions, chases, and one-liners.  Cohesive scripts, fleshed out characters, and logical motivations aren't necessary.  The sad part is--they aren't wrong most of the time.<br /><br />The inevitable comparisons of "Sahara" to "National Treasure" have been made abundantly.  They might as well be the same movie, enough said.  There are also similarities to any number of James Bond films, and those are legitimate too--Except James Bond is a highly trained superagent while the "Sahara" boys are flippant treasure hunters.  Nothing real is at stake for our boys, even with hundreds of people dying. After surviving a near massacre, losing their only transportation, being stranded in the desert, being chased by a military force, and having just killed dozens of people--the natural reaction is, of course, "I lost my hat."  Hard for us to get too excited if there is no real danger!<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey burst onto the scene over ten years ago now with charisma to spare.  He has done little, however, to stretch as an actor.  He capitalizes on his looks and charm over and over again in lightweight bubblegum pop and/or not-so-funny romantic comedies.  He even produced this epic--trying to cash in once more.  Steve Zahn, a talented actor, also seems content to play the same wisecracking sidekick repeatedly.  And Penelope Cruz--let's just be kind and say she is convincing neither as an action heroine or a doctor.<br /><br />I'm in a generous mood today, and I'll award "Sahara" 2 stars.  It has some pretty scenery to look at.  It knows it isn't very good, so at least it isn't pretentious.  Having a bit of self-awareness is always a good thing.  KGHarris, 10/06.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ALIEN IN DETAIL"></head><body><p>When done right, buying a DVD is more than just buying a movie, but more like buying a library... and ALIEN is a library of pure entertainment (on a scale of one to ten on FIDDLE FACTOR - i.e. how many bells, whistles and  switches to play with... ALIEN get's a ten... you'll spend an hour or two  just flipping through features having fun).  Packed with extras, you can't  go wrong with this first in the ALIEN series.  Original posters, concept  art, original alien design, plus a crisp, clean film transfer... you can't  go wrong with this.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

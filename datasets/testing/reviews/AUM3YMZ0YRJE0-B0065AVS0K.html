<meta name="summary" content="raucous, grotesquely violent, cynical, unbelievable, and very fun"></head><body><p>This film is one of the best translations of a comic book, with great attention paid to the atmospherics, that I have ever seen.  From the moment it starts, the viewer is treated to a succession of characters and their bizarre adventures, which appear disjointed and non-sensical, but vivid with unbelievable violence, sudden death, and what are revealed to be intriguing clues to a bigger picture that is never completely explained.  It is filmed for the most part in black and white, a wonderful evocation of film noir and gotham, with occasional colors thrown in for unusual characters like the yellow man, or simply for splurting blood.<br /><br />The acting is truly excellent, starting with Willis, who once again proves capable of delivering a quirky, funny character for whom you can suspend your disbelief.  He is a sick cop, trying to do some good one last time, leading to an awful adventure.  His ward, a lovely young girl who grows into  Jessica Alba, is a pawn in a larger game that is unclear.  Then there is Micky Rourke, an extremely ugly thug who is out for revenge and crazy but also, the viewer suspects, perhaps redeemable even if he tortures some victims to death.<br /><br />Recommended.  I will definitely watch this again.  There are many nuances and clues that will come together only with multiple viewings, a bigger picture that will emerge through interpretation.  That is far better fun than a single-watch passtime film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than first two but still not as good as a first class horror movie!"></head><body><p>This part was the most underrated in first three. and better than first two. In this part Jason found his famous mask and became Jason that most of us know! First part honestly was ridiculous. second part was better but not scary at all, but this part had some real horror scenes. It was a better try than first two but still not as good as first class horror movies. Most of murder scenes were good specially when Jason split up that boy into two parts I reallt got excited! but Killing Rick by pressing his skull although was good at concept but was fair in production. Jumping out one of his eyes from a soft plastic face was more like some of that games in play houses! Nowadays they make every thing they imagine with CG, natural and beleavable! but in old movies I think they should have not created scenes that they couldn't made them perfect!<br /><br />Anyway, in my opinion this was the part that real Firday the 13th series has begun!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="But Can Vampires Kill WereWolves?"></head><body><p>The special effects are very good but the effort to blend Dracula, Frankenstein, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, 'The Brides of Dracula', the Wolfman and 'Dracula vs. the Wolfman' [or is it 'Frankenstein vs. the Wolfman?] all together does get a little confusing.<br /><br />Frankenstein's Monster is kind of a good guy and Dracula, although every inch a bad guy, is fascinating.  Igor is a real jerk.  Dracula's brides are really quite something although I don't know why they are nippleless.  Maybe it's because their goblin babies are hatched dead already and need human blood rather than milch.  I never really figured it out.</p></body></html>

Didn't have to be; in 2 hours, 20 minutes there could have been some fabulous interactions between the uneducated clones and the outside world.  Instead, its running, chasing, digital compositing and showing how much they let Michael Bay spend.<br /><br />Speaking of Mr. Bay, his commentary shows he has no need to work on his self-confidence and its not very interesting.  Talking about one of the better scenes--the abandoned train station--he says "I'm not gonna tell you where it is".  Took exactly one click in Google to find out.<br /><br />One thing Bay's right about is that it was difficult to market "The Island".  It forced them to tell you in the trailer, that there was no island so what else do you need to know?</p></body></html>

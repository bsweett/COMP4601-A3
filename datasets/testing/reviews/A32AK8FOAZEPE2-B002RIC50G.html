<meta name="summary" content="maybe a little better than the novel?"></head><body><p>this movie turned out to be quite watchable, because i failed to appreciate the book and couldn't finish it. a very tragic story about how hannibal had gradually degenerated himself into a monster. just like the german philosopher said, 'don't turn yourself into a monster while hunt the monster.' become a man-eater is just like after the lion tasted the human flesh, the beast would become obsessed in eating humans, because only the human being's blood is salty that's more tasty than other creatures.</p></body></html>

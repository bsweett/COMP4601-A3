<meta name="summary" content="While a romance on the truth, still very exciting and moving"></head><body><p>Let us stipulate that this movie is romance on the book, "Braveheart" (by Randall Wallace), which is itself a romance on the very real Scotts hero, William Wallace.  In those two steps of fictionalization, loosely based on history, more than a few facts can float off into the ether.  You can easily search the web and find any number of websites that will list all the errors in the movie.  There was even a show in the History Channel discussing the reality of Wallace's life versus the movie and why certain choices were made, such as fighting the battle of Stirling Bridge on a field in the movie rather than on a bridge as it was in real life.  Never mind the fact of the real life ages of the characters making most of the interactions in the movie absolutely impossible.<br /><br />And while all comparisons of fact and fiction are interesting, two facts remain:  the movie made the name of William Wallace more popularly known than he had been in centuries, and it is a very effective and exciting movie.  Believe me, I understand the pain of those who truly love Wallace and feel that their hero has been disgraced and cheated.  It is almost always true that facts suffer greatly when compressed into the constraints of a movie and those that know the facts understand how they add to the meaning and purpose of their hero.  They resent any compromise or cheapening for simple expediency or catering to popular appetites.  This is all fair and true.  However, this movie is a fiction of a fiction of based on real figures.  In a way, it is the opposite of the old "Dragnet" show.  The events are fiction; only the names have been kept.<br /><br />Leaving history aside, the film is exciting, stirs feelings of patriotism, and allows good to triumph over evil even at death.  In the movie, Wallace has to overcome everything, including the loss of family and betrayal by those who should have been his friends.  He has real fears of what he has to face at the end and it is his faith that provides the foundation of his courage.  That kind of nobility inspires us and stirs our own resolve.<br /><br />The battle scenes, while historically inaccurate to a great degree, are amazing to behold.  There is a lot of gore and violence in these medieval battles.  It is that gore and a couple of gratuitous uses of the medieval f-word that give the movie an R rating more than the brief scene at the grove with Wallace and his new wife.<br /><br />While not one of my all time favorite films, it is very much worth viewing and contemplating.</p></body></html>

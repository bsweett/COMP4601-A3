<meta name="summary" content="An Intergalactic Thrill Ride."></head><body><p>After the successes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and the unbeatable Star Wars, Ridley Scott gave us the impecable classic Alien.  Alien is different than all sci-fi classics.  It is a little more believable and a little more sophisticated.  The art design is great.  The acting is very real and honest. The special effects are amazing, and the score is also wonderful.  The cinematography is one of my favorite aspects of the film, because it takes you deeper into fear.  The movie is great to watch on a large TV and the special edition DVD is really good. I highly reccomend this.</p></body></html>

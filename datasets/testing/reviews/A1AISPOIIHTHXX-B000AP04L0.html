<meta name="summary" content="Clever satire and quite funny too"></head><body><p>I only worked in one office for a month and I can relate to a lot of things in this movie: the printer that barely worked at times, the overdemanding boss, the rules and regulations and that feeling that any kind of profit and you're not going to see a dime from it. Unlike certain comedy movies which are based primarily on being disgusting, rude or people getting smacked by things, Office Space gets its laughs by moments where you go "I know someone exactly like that".<br /><br />Peter and 2 friends work at Initech, a computer company that prides itself on making workers do what they've been told to do. After a hypnotherapy session, Peter becomes carefree and uninhibited but he gets a promotion. How to get back at them? Put a virus in the computer system that takes the remainders of transactions and puts them in a separate account. Will they get caught?<br /><br />One of the great things about this movie is that it seems to take itself seriously while having fun at the same time. While there's no big comedy punchlines, the film is quite funny at certain personas we've met such as that slooow tallllking guy...mmkay? Or bosses in restaurants making demands while saying it's up to you if you want to do it but I'm gonna whine if you don't.<br /><br />Acting-wise the film's straight across the board. While I only know 3 cast members(obviously Jennifer Aniston and the others being Dave Herman, voice actor on Futurama and John C. McGinley), everyone's perfect in their roles and even spout some great one-liners too. My favorite: a neighbor, overhearing about Peter's plan gone awry, declines an offer to visit Peter saying "that's ok, don't want you to **** up my life too." The only thing I didn't like is that the character you're going to love to hate never gets a comeuppance, like somebody losing it and punching him. Kind of disappointing.<br /><br />How skimpy on the extras. This "Special Edition" practically has one making-of and deleted scenes and DVD-ROM stuff. No commentary? Grr, which is too bad cause I would've loved to hear from at least anybody but still this is a film that definately warrants a purchase.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Revolutionary Road"></head><body><p>`Revolutionary Road' is one of those films that although not especially `positive' or `happy' is very well written and acted and draws you in from the start. Following a successful couple who seem to have it all, good job, nice house, two children and a happy marriage, this film explores how all is not quite what it seems and the tensions and frustrations that simmer away beneath any marriage. The acting from both Di Caprio and Winslet is fantastic and the natural chemistry between them makes the love and fight scenes all the more potent. This film is infused with a sense of sadness throughout as you see the couple go from carefree, idealistic young adults to a confused, frustrated and angry set in their ways couple. This film also looks at how the good and bad things in life can trap you into set patterns that don't fulfil you, things like a pay rise or promotion or a pregnancy that alter your plans for the future. The fifties set pieces and costumes are great, as is the directing from Mendes and this film is a very polished affair. You won't walk away with a spring in your step, but that isn't necessary every time you watch a film, and the overall effect at the end is so powerful that this is well worth a watch. This may be deemed by some as bleak, but life isn't always a bunch of roses and it's good to see Hollywood acknowledge that for a change.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

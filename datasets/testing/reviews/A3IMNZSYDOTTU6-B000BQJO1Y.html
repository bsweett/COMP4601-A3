<meta name="summary" content="'Dawn'  Just As Good A 'Dead' Film...Romero Does It Again..."></head><body><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD...it just oozes with fright and serious zombie innovation. This sequel to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD really lives up to its predecessor in ways that most horror film sequels do not. The best part, that there are true hints of comedy thrown into the mix of gore, terror, scares, and what is the most blatant poke at 'consumerism'.<br /><br />'DAWN' picks up apparently where the first 'DEAD' left off, with a band of survivors trying to escape the wrath of the all the mindless zombies that have infested the country (and probably the rest of the world). They head to a shopping mall where, to their dismay, they find more flesh-eating zombies waiting for them. In the beginning of the movie, there is a segment that will make you cringe as some officials reach the basement level of a complex and find a horde of zombies feasting on flesh. The survivors inside the mall find they must now band together what they need and rely on each other to survive, and unfortunately not all of them do survive, but this is where the blatant poke at 'consumerism' really comes into full effect. It's very funny, very obvious, but also a thread in the spool of the movie. It's an integral part of DAWN OF THE DEAD, but so are the horde of zombies. My favorite part is the segment where a zombie comes walking towards Roger while he gases up the helicopter, and instead of actually making it that far, his head gets cut off by the copter blades because he walks way too close to them. That is a comical moment, but also a scary reminder that there aren't enough bullets in the world to kill off all the zombies.<br /><br />DAWN OF THE DEAD is another masterpiece from the wicked mind of George A. Romero, and while DAY OF THE DEAD would follow a slightly different path, DAWN OF THE DEAD is another reminder that horror really had plenty of genius left in its twisted little world. (Make sure you get the rare but find-able 137 minute unrated director's cut of this version, you'll be glad you did)</p></body></html>

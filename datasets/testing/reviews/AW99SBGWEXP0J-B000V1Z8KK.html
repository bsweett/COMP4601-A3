<meta name="summary" content="Shooter"></head><body><p>Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) is an ex-special ops sharpshooter.  Colonel Isaac Johnson (Glover) ventures into the middle of nowhere to find Swagger, and ask for his help.  Apparently, someone is planning to assassinate the President soon, and they want Swagger to figure out how to stop the attack.  He agrees, but then finds himself framed for the attempt.  Soon, he is on the run, relying on help from Sarah (Mara), the girlfriend of his ex-Marine partner and FBI agent Nick Memphis (Pena), both of whom become targets as well.<br /><br />Despite all the action, "Shooter" has quite a bit of substance, with twists and turns that are unexpected.  The movie moves at a fast pace that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.  Wahlberg is solid as the ordinary guy Swagger.  Danny Glover is very good in his important supporting role as well.  If you are looking for a good action movie with some brains, "Shooter" is the movie for you.</p></body></html>

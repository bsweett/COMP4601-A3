Its three-hour running time might scare some first-time viewers off, but don't be one of them.  This movie is tense, exciting, and meticulous in detail.  The first time I saw it was in the theaters, and its length was a bit taxing because I was tired before the movie started.  But subsequent viewings at home (and I have watched it A LOT) make me love this movie more and more.  It has high tech robberies, fierce shootouts in downtown L.A., and a wonderful soundtrack featuring Moby and others.  This movie sets the high standard for the genre.</p></body></html>

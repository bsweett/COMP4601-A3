<meta name="summary" content="David Fincher's best since SEVEN!"></head><body><p>I was introduced to the wild, dark, and frightening world of David Fincher when I was in middle school. I went with a friend of mine to see SEVEN. It stayed with me for years, and still manages to give me the creeps. THE GAME. What can I say about THE GAME? One of the greatest mind benders of all time, also featuring one of Michael Douglas' best performances. FIGHT CLUB was marketed as a run of the mill action flick, when in actuality it is a deep, philosophical masterpiece that I loved. PANIC ROOM held me in suspense as well. I remember seeing it in Charlotte, amongst a very interactive audience, who were all screaming and hollering at the screen - "RUN, JODIE, RUN!" It was one of the most memorable - and one of the loudest - experiences that I have ever had at the theatre...<br /><br />And here comes ZODIAC in 2007. I missed the theatrical run, but I do remember that it opened on a Friday night while I just so happened to be in San Francisco, California with some of my college buddies. We opted to see BLACK SNAKE MOAN instead. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved BLACK SNAKE MOAN and all, but now that I have seen ZODIAC in all of it's glory, I wish that we had seen it instead. I can only imagine the impact this would have had on me in a full theatre, all blown up on a big screen. As it turns out, I missed it, but I did watch it for the very first time tonight. Talk about a film that can simutaneously creep you out and intrigue the piss out of you at the same time - this is it!<br /><br />I haven't been so caught up in a film like this since THE DEPARTED. I know that they're two different films, but that's not the point. I could not pull myself away from the television through the entire length, not even to use the bathroom. If I had to piss, I held it. I held it until my bladder was about to burst. The fact that they never caught this dude is so unsettling. There is a sense of mystery and dread that hangs over your head and STAYS there as the film ends, with Donovan's "Hurdy Gurdy Man" playing quietly in the background. I'll never be able to hear that song again without having this film spring to mind. You really come to respect all of the police and detectives who worked so diligently on the case. Til this day, they are still working on this case, according to the title cards at the end of the film.<br /><br />The performances are all excellent. Robert Downey, Jr. and Mark Ruffalo were totally ignored as far as Oscar consideration goes, and so was the film and it's wonderfully talented director. This is a change of pace for David Fincher. It is totally different from anything that he has done in the past, yet at the same time, he uses all the right flourishes that have worked before. The cinematography from Harry Savides (BIRTH, LAST DAYS) is brilliantly done. By the way, I also have to throw a shout out to Jake Gyllenhaal's wonderful performance as Robert Graysmith, a young cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who, over time, becomes more and more obessessed with the case.<br /><br />All in all, PERFECT film, and highly recommended to those who have the patience to sit through the two and a half running time without complaining. SEE IT. NOW!<br /><br />(By the way, this has to be one of the longest reviews that I have ever written for Amazon, so trust me. It's that good.)</p></body></html>

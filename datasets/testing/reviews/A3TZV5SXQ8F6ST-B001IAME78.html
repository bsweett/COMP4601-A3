<meta name="summary" content="The Green Machine"></head><body><p>There is not some reworking of the comic book character, so the movie is focused on action scenes which truly capture this unique super hero in fist-throwing romps. Actor and co-screenwriter Edward Norton portrays Bruce Banner in a way to push things to the computer-generated - and highly cartoonish - Incredible Hulk, who clearly is the star.<br /><br />Without a complicated backstory and rapid pace - though it may have too much of a video game feel for some - the battles of the Incredible Hulk are...well, incredible; especially when the military futilely throws all types of gadgetry at the large one. This emerging franchise has mapped out a solid plan to become a successful second-tier hit in the future summers of super heroes on the large screen.</p></body></html>

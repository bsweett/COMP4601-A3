<meta name="summary" content="Psychological Terror at its Best"></head><body><p>During the period of the late 70s and early 80s, several slasher horror movies were released, such as Friday the 13th, but The Shining generates its horror through psychological means which keeps the viewer guessing throughout the movie.<br /><br />Using a script based on the novel by Stephen King, director Stanley  Kubrick has created a story with menacing settings and excellent performances by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd.  Nicholson stars as Jack Torrance, who's come to the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker.  Duvall plays his wife Wendy, and Lloyd stars as the Torrance's son Danny.<br /><br />At his interview, Jack is told about a former caretaker named Delbert Grady, who murdered his wife and two daughters.  Soon, Jack is experiencing his own psychological changes.  The Overlook soon becomes Jack's personal playground of terror as Wendy and Danny are forced to fight for their lives against Jack.  Will they survive, or will Jack succeed in killing them as Delbert Grady did to his family?<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Nicholson's performance is first-rate, and his "Here's Johnny!" line has become legendary.  Shelley Duvall does a fine job as the scared wife, and Danny Lloyd's performance of Danny, who has psychological powers, is very good as well.  I highly recommend this thrilling and scary film.  Watch this movie and experience terror without all of the blood and gore.</p></body></html>

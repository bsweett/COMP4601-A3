Red Dragon is a really good prequel to The Silence of the Lambs. It shows how Hannibal got in that room and how he helps Will Graham find The Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy is a psychopath who is obsessed a painting called Red Dragon, and had an abusive grandmother. The Doctor is in, and I highly recommend RED DRAGON!!!</p></body></html>

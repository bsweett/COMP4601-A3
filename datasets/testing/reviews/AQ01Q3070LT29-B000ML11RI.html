As with the films <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009R1TI6">Rumble Fish (Special Edition)</a>(1983), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)</a> (1993) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305308659">Pleasantville (New Line Platinum Series)</a> (1998), their is a a splash of color from time to time, mostly blood red in this one.<br />  This film is based on Frank Miller's adult graphic novels so this film is not for children to see.  Contains violence and nudity.<br /> Bruce Willis begins the film as "Hartigan".<br />  Mickey Rourke returns to the silver screen.  In real-life, Micky Rourke's face was disfigured by his time of boxing after he quit acting.  His face has since been reconstructed and the muscles are really his.  Rourke did wear some rubber make-up in the film.<br />  Clive Owen looks the "Bond" type in this role minus tuxedo.<br />  Benicio Del Toro's face and body has filled out since his days of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M53GMW">Licence To Kill</a> (1989).  In Sin City, he plays "Jackie Boy".<br />  Elijah Wood shows off his karate moves.  Powers Booth plays "Senator Roark".  Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner [1982]) is "Cardinal Roark"  Josh Hartnett (Halloween H2O [1998]) also makes a couple appearances.<br />  Michael Madsen who we have seen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDVNNU">Die Another Day</a> (2002) plays "Bob" in Sin City.<br /><br /> Update: Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, will to be released October 4, 2013.</p></body></html>

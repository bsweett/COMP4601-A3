<meta name="summary" content="Overwritten debut effort for the talented Zach Braff"></head><body><p>Zach Braff of "Scrubs" fame wrote, directed and starred in "Garden State."  The flick has a lot of good ideas, but at its heart there is a sodden, dull story that cannot be enlivened by copious amounts of wit.<br /><br />Braff plays "Large," a once-successful actor now reduced to waiting tables in a Vietnamese restaurant.  He returns home to Jersey when his mother dies, stirring lots of ugly family history.  Once home, Large's emotional zombie-status becomes evident, but is almost matched by the toneless muddle of high school friends he runs into.  The only spark is Sam (Natalie Portman), who for some reason falls for this sack of dull platitudes.<br /><br />The script is too clever by half, invoking hamsters, silent velcro, an abyss, infomercials on real estate, and other inanities in an attempt at edginess.  The movie feels like it was written by a hyper-depressed writer cut loose from the sad last year of "Northern Exposure."  Couple this with a too-on-the-nose soundtrack and a wasted crop of actors (why, Ian Holm, why?), and you've got "Garden State."<br /><br />Here's hoping Mr. Braff can get past the quips and into some serious storytelling.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Weird, but enjoyable"></head><body><p>Simon Pegg oozes hilarity. He is a natural comedian, and he doesn't even need to try. I've always found that British comedies are much funnier and wittier than American ones. I think it has something to do with their overly dry humour and their love for the F-bomb. It just sounds better coming from a Brit.<br /><br />Anywho, Hot Fuzz starts off somewhat normal but then halfway through the film, it gets a tad weird. What you think the plot is about is not what it really is, and it just comes at you all of a sudden from a million different directions. It's just weird. Oh, and the excess of blood and gore is also a cool and unexpected treat.<br /><br />But it is also funny, for the most part. The gags are funny, the characters are even funnier and the film is stylised in the same vein of Shaun of the Dead, which is by far funnier than this. They even reused a few of the same actors. You gotta love the little cameo with Bill Nighy, that guy is just fabulous.  Nick Frost is also a great funny sidekick. I was also pleased to see Timothy Dalton in this. He has a nice little role here as well.<br /><br />The film certainly keeps you entertained and interested. Its a sort of who-dunnit with a funny twist. If you love British humour, you will probably like this movie.</p></body></html>

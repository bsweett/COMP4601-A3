<meta name="summary" content=""Oh, I'm in a glass case of emotion!""></head><body><p>This is one of the most hilarious comedies from Will Ferrel and Steve Carell. I don't care if it looks dumb or it's not very smart, all I care about is that this film definintely makes me laugh. Carell steals the show as the mildly retarded Brick ("Fantastic!"), while Ferrel and Applegate make an interesting onscreen duo. And let's not forget some unexpected cameos in the middle of the film.<br /><br />Watch it, and you'll be in hysterics. And don't forget: always drink your scotty scotch scotch!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful beginning to a movie that fails to deliver"></head><body><p>Tnis 20th James Bond movie really fails to deliver on its promise. After a rather flat and tired precredits sequence the movie sets into a comfortable pace and looks to be heading  to be one of the best movies of the series.<br />But, somewhere around 007s arrival in Iceland the movie seems to lose both focus and intelligence and what we are left with is the feeling of a movie with a definite split personality. A great beginning and a terrible, boring conclusion.<br />The writers also seem to be devoid of new ideas blatently copying ideas from previous entries. They called them 'homages" but I don't buy it. It's clear that Purvis and Wade are tired with 007 and just wanted a paint by numbers Bond movie to churn out.<br />Very disappointing - especially after a three year wait following the (even worse) The World is Not Enough).</p></body></html>

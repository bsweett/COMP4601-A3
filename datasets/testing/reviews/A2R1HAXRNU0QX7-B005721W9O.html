<meta name="summary" content="A very funny & well-conceived spoof!"></head><body><p>I recently re-watched GALAXY QUEST after a roughly decade long hiatus.  I think it may have gotten even better with time.  If you wanted to make a movie spoofing the original STAR TREK series and the cultural phenomenon it has become...you simply couldn't do better than this film.  It pokes fun of the genre, the cast, the fans, the cheesiness and the conventions.  Often, rather pointed jabs.  But it's infused with real affection, and it even tells a pretty exciting and moving story of its own.<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest" was the name of a `60s TV series that looks an awful lot like STAR TREK, the original series.  You've got the handsome, womanizing captain whose shirt is often ripped off to expose a glistening bare torso (Tim Allen), you've got the token woman working on the bridge, whose only job is to repeat the things the computer is saying outloud already (Sigourney Weaver), the alien with the serious demeanor and no sense of humor (Alan Rickman), and even the guy without a name who always beams down to the planet and gets killed in the opening few minutes (Sam Rockwell).  And while Engineer Scotty isn't directly spoofed, you've got Tony Shaloub as the blissed-out, mellow actor who once filled that role.<br /><br />Twenty years later, these actors have little to do but make paid appearances at conventions, in costume.  Some absolutely hate it (Rickman), others tolerate it and for Allen, it's the highlight of his life...although at home, he's a hopeless lush.  These old cast members can barely stand each other, and lord knows they are pretty sick of never getting to do anything else.<br /><br />Turns out, though, that the broadcasts of their shows have traveled through space and been intercepted by an alien race on a distant planet.  These aliens, however, think the broadcasts are "historical documents" and they create the science needed to perfectly replicate what they see on the show.  And now these gentle aliens are in trouble and so travel to earth to enlist the help of their old heroes...the cast of "Galaxy Quest."<br /><br />I won't say much about the plot, except to note that it plays out much like a Star Trek episode...it's a legitimate adventure story, coupled with a great spoof.  Will our weary cast members rise to the challenge?  Will they find redemption?  Can you guess the answer?  And because you can guess...your enjoyment should actually be enhanced, because the film finds delightful ways to surprise you throughout.<br /><br />The script is very good.  The jokes aren't exactly Oscar quality...but neither are they cheap.  The film takes the time to develop real characters...and is careful to make the aliens quite unique themselves.  These aren't just cookie-cutter aliens designed to fill the needs of the plot.  We can actually see how these actors might actually take a liking to these aliens.<br /><br />And if the script is good, the cast is GREAT.  This is a modest film, overall (even though the special effect still look pretty good even today)...but these actors are clearly fully engaged in what they're doing.  Weaver is hilarious, really spoofing both Star Trek and Ellen Ripley.  Often, I find Weaver to be a bit tight as an actress...very good, but lacking a breezy quality.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's relaxed and having great fun.  Shaloub is a delight, stealing most of the scenes he's in.  Sam Rockwell takes his manic energy and puts it to perfect use...he's convinced that he's destined to be "that guy who dies on that planet."  Rickman is droll and understated.  At first, his character is seething with resentment at having to wear that awful makeup and say those stupid lines.  Watching his gradual growth is a subtle pleasure of the film.  And Tim Allen (outside of his great voicework in the TOY STORY films) may actually give his most credible film performance here.  He's not a great actor, nor even a particularly adept comic...but this role is almost custom-fitted to him.  He only has to be "serious" a little bit, and he can handle it.  He is called on to be glib and self-mocking...and is able to muster than quite readily.<br /><br />GALAXY QUEST was a real treat to revisit, and I heartily recommend it for either a repeat viewing or a first time adventure...particularly if you're familiar with what it is spoofing!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Friday the 13th (1980) Movie Review from The Massie Twins"></head><body><p>Friday the 13th is one of the most famous slasher films of all time, spawning sequels to the point of ridiculousness in which subsequent entries into the franchise practically parody themselves. Following a pattern even more impressive than the recent Saw films phenomenon, there was one new Jason film every year for an entire decade, skipping only a single year between Friday the 13th Part VI (1986) and Part VII (1988). None of the ideas in the film are all that unique, the music is a laughable cross between Psycho and Jaws, and the acting and dialogue are positively pathetic. Of course, the reason for watching such a horror movie is for the suspense, violence, nudity, gore and ultimate body count (a total of 10), which is served up generously in this 80's B-movie, with outstanding blood and makeup effects by the legendary Tom Savini.<br /><br />In 1958, Camp Crystal Lake became known as "Camp Blood" to the locals after a young boy drowned and several vicious murders occurred shortly after. Present day finds a group of counselors working hard (which translates to goofing off and rolling in the hay) to re-open the rundown campgrounds for a new batch of kids. But just as soon as they start piecing the place back together, one by one the counselors are slaughtered by a machete-wielding maniac. (Look for an early role by Kevin Bacon.)<br /><br />Friday the 13th struggles with seriousness, mostly resorting to campy dialogue and poor acting to connect the string of gruesome deaths. There's humor running through the majority of the slayings, even though spurting blood isn't shied away from. And once the killings start, the tiny bits of plot are completely pointless - each scene segues from one attack to the next. It's evident by the conclusion that we weren't even meant to guess the true identity of the killer. The deaths all seem to have a bloodthirsty infatuation with throats, whether it's slashing, slitting or spearing with an arrow. First-person perspective camerawork is used frequently to put the audience in the butcher's shoes, making the reactions of the victims more startling and the actual murderer invisible.<br /><br />Notorious movie villain Jason Voorhees is most recognizable for his ghastly hockey mask, but this first film didn't even introduce that indispensable accessory. In fact, it isn't until the third part of the franchise that he finally dons the disguise. Although nothing about Friday the 13th stands out as incredibly imaginative, and the vexatious music is either a bad homage or a rip-off of Psycho versus Jaws, it isn't without a certain level of amusement; it either unmasks the deeply rooted bloodthirstiness in everyone, or it's just too much schlock to be anything but silly thrills. Through 11 more sequels, the formula never changes.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></body></html>

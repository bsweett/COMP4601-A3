<meta name="summary" content="Altman's mildly amusing homage to the radio show"></head><body><p>"Prairie Home Companion" is director Robert Altman's homage to the long running radio series. The (fictional) action unfolds during the last performance of the show, which is being shut down as the radio station has been bought by some Texans who have other plans.<br /><br />"Prairie Home Companion" features many of the real stars of the radio show as themselves including the show's driving force Garrison Keillor. Sadly Keillor is no screen actor and the scenes with him bring the film to a grinding halt.<br /><br />Much of the dialogue in the underdeveloped plot appears to be improvised and leads nowhere. Many of the characters are also underdeveloped - especially Kevin Kline as "Guy Noir" the bumbling security man and Virginia Madsen as the "Dangerous Woman".<br /><br />The only thing that perks this film up are the musical numbers - especially the ones with John C. O'Reilly and Woody Harrelson as the singing cowboys Dusty and Lefty.<br /><br />"Prairie Home Companion" is somewhat of a disappointment to fans of the radio show and may actually appeal more to those who are not familiar with it.<br /><br />Although mildly amusing, one can't help but ask the question - what exactly was the point of all this?</p></body></html>

When the X-Men were produced into two great feature films I was very hopeful as to the disposition of the promised Fantastic Four feature.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: A FILM ABOUT COPING WITH CHANGE - STRESS & ESTRANGEMENT<br /><br />The "Fantastic Four" feature film took the 'origins of the fantastic four' as the movie's theme. To this extent the film was competent, but nothing out of the ordinary, when compared to the recent X-Men and Spider Man releases. Nevertheless, this film is entertaining and does make sense, although it is not beneath pandering to young men via Jessica Alba's implicit nudity. It is mostly a film about people facing the stress and the estrangement that comes with major unexpected changes in themselves, and how others see and relate to them. This is most coherently portrayed by Ben Grim/'THE THING' [Michael Chiklis] who brings some much needed humanity to this piece in the form a small measure of a 'beauty and the beast' subplot. In essence, Ben Grim has turned into 'The Thing' and unlike the others he can not turn back - he is stuck in his superhero mode and basically feels apart from everything that was in his world, before the accident in Space. Only a blind woman can see that he is not a monster, and this could have been enlarged within the plot to good effect.<br /><br />THINGS TO MARVEL AT:<br /><br />The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge is easily the most amazing scene in the film. Ben Grim is on center stage as he confronts a would-be jumper as he ponders the same thoughts [jumping off the bridge]. With a little comedy and special effects, Ben Grim stops a huge truck cold, saves the jumper and creates a debacle on the bridge that ends with the recognition of the 'Fantastic 4' as group of superheros as a breaking headline story on the news.<br /><br />- * MAJOR ACTORS - * * Tim Story - Director *<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd - Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic<br /><br />Jessica Alba - Susan Storm/The Invisible Girl<br /><br />Chris Evans - Johnny Storm/The Human Torch<br /><br />Michael Chiklis - Ben Grimm/The Thing<br /><br />Julian McMahon - Dr. Victor Von Doom<br /><br />Hamish Linklater - Leonard<br /><br />Kerry Washington - Alicia Masters<br /><br />Laurie Holden - Debbie McIlvane<br /><br />David Parker - Ernie<br /><br />Kevin McNulty - Jimmy O'Hoolihan<br /><br />Maria Menounos - Sexy Nurse<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN DIGITAL TRANSFER OF AUDIO & VIDEO<br /><br />** SPECIAL FEATURES ** LOOKS LIKE A LOT MORE THAN IT IS **<br /><br />- Available Subtitles: English, Spanish<br /><br />- Available Audio Tracks: English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)<br /><br />- Commentary by: Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud<br /><br />- 3 deleted scenes<br /><br />- The Fantastic Tour: Exclusive behind-the-scenes home video hosted by the entire cast<br /><br />- Making of Fantastic Four<br /><br />- Fox Movie Channel Presents Casting Session & Making A Scene<br /><br />- Music videos: Everything Burns, Come On Come In, Music<br /><br />Exclusive inside look at X-Men 3 - hosted by producer Avi Arad<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: WORKMANLIKE ADAPTATION OF A TRULY FANTASTIC COMIC SERIES<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED:<br /><br />X2: X-Men United (2003, Bryan Singer)<br /><br />Spider-Man (2002, Sam Raimi)<br /><br />X-Men (2000, Bryan Singer)<br /><br />The Hulk (2003, Ang Lee)<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 (2004, Sam Raimi</p></body></html>

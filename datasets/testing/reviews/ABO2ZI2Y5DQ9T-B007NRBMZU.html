<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Fine Adaptaion of Bradbury's Time-Traveling Idea"></head><body><p>The idea of 'The Butterfly Effects' sounds unique, but actually it is a more violent and unnerving version of Ray Bradbury's 'A Sound of Thunder' (which was filmed in 2003 with the director Peter Hyams, but of which release is much delayed).  For all its overwrought script, 'The Butterfly Effect' remains intriging all through, with the time paradox idea twisted and turned countless times.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher (not so bad playing a serious role) is Evan, who as a little boy experiences sudden memory losses.  Whenever it happens, something terrible has happened around him, but the boy does not remember the truths while, as the film implies, the kids and adults surrounding him know, and greatly affected by, these horrible events.<br /><br />[IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE PAST...] Grown-up and in college, Evan is now a brilliant student majoring in psychology.  But one day he finds he has special ability to 'go back' to the certain point of the past, and 'see' the incidents that really happened to him.  Moreover, he realizes by interfering the events, he can change the entire course of the life of him and his girlfriend Kayleigh (excellent Amy Smart).  But the more Evan interfers, the more the history gets meddled, often with a very awful result.<br /><br />Avid film fans would promptly point out that the central idea is a familiar one -- remember the films like 'Frequency,' 'Somewhere in Time,' 'Retroactive,' and of course, the great 'Back to the Future' trilogy.  'The Butterfly Effect,' least humorous among them, uses this time-travel concept in a way those films never did before, including the disturbing elements like murders, abusing children, prostitution, hurting animal, and so on and on.  'Donnie Darko' surely contains pretty dismal moments, but compared with this, it is a real fun movie.<br /><br />The story of 'The Butterfly Effect' never stops, and by refusing to give us the chance to think a moment, it gives the audiences a non-stop roller-coaster ride, which changes the fate of Evan, Kaykeigh, and the others involved Evan's life in the most unpredictable fashion.  Though the ride is never boring, too many things are crammed in the script, and with less characters and incidents the film could have been better.<br /><br />Finally, as to Ashton Kutcher himself.  I think he did better acting than I expected, but still I could not shake off the image of him in 'Dude, Where's My Car?' and most notably, TV series 'Punk'd.'  I can understand the opinions of some reviewers saying he is unfairly treated -- I agree -- but if he really wants to be taken seriously, he should quit the hidden camera show immediately, or at least, before they start to make a sequel.</p></body></html>

It was a throwback to the old classic serials and reminded us all why the movies have been an important part in our lives.  "I HATE SNAKES!!!" will always remain one of my favorite quotes.  'Temple of Doom' was still pretty good, but excessively violent (one reason for the PG13 rating).  'Doom' has one helluva rollercoaster type ride through a mine shaft that ends up on a falling rope bridge.  This is exciting stuff.  By the time 'Crusade' came out, the cast was older, and the action seemed tamed.  The focus was on the comical bantering with father and "Junior" and not what made the other two great action films.  Still, if you are alone in the house and its raining, this trilogy is a great way to pass the day away.</p></body></html>

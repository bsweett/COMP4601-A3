<meta name="summary" content="What A Cast Of Characters"></head><body><p>Snatch is a bit over the top but it is incredibly fun movie to watch for a number of reasons. First the combination of London gangsters, Gypsies , Jewish diamond merchants and dogs contribute to some of the sharpest and memorable exchanges that I've heard in a movie since Pulp Fiction. There are many funny lines that will stay with you a long time after watching this. Brad Pitt does a fabulous job as a gypsy bare knuckle boxing champ with an inscrutable accent. Dennis Farina is great as the only American character in the film. The rest of the cast is what makes the film tick Jason Straham as Turkish the narrator and small time hood is the glue that holds the whole thing together.<br />Snatch may not be for everybody but if you like Tarrantino you'll like Guy Ritchie as well.</p></body></html>

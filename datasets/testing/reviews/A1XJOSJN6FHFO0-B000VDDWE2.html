Perhaps?"></head><body><p>We have all heard the warnings to stop destroying our planet and this movie makes us look at just what might happen if we don't listen.  I sat glued to the TV as this movie played before me watching the total destruction of the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards that devoured a good part of the northern world. Seeing New York City destroyed was blood chilling and the human element that was weaved into the storyline brought it right on home.<br /><br />This was a great movie, the special effects were outstanding.  I never saw a building freeze and crumble before. Wow!What a twist on total devastation.  I recommend this movie to everyone, it certainly is well worth your time, and perhaps will make us all think a little bit harder about the future of our planet, and what we can do to make it a brighter one.</p></body></html>

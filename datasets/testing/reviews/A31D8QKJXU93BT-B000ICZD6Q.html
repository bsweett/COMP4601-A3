<meta name="summary" content="Aging Gracefully"></head><body><p>How do actors age gracefully? Watch Dennis Quaid in his recent performances, especially here opposite Topher Grace. The former leading man is now a handsome character actor, and a very good one. He's old enough to be Grace's father; indeed, that's the gimmick of this ungimmicky film, which is also very good. In a corporate takeover, Grace becomes his boss and falls for his daughter. Grace is endearing as a clueless ladder-climbing lad, but the older actor is indelible as the resilient dad. Quaid's new career in films has Academy Award written all over it.<br /><br />There is much to admire in this unblinking look at corporate survival. As a sort of executive suite swami, who settles everyone's hash at the end, Malcolm McDowell (another leading man who has aged well) relishes his incisive cameo. However, this is not what the movie is about. It's really interested in how people relate to one another, in the cliche of office jargon, "up close and personal." Not another corporate satire? Not another hug everybody movie? Sometimes the old formulas are transformed when directors know how to refresh them.<br /><br />Writer-director Paul Weitz, his editor and cinematographer, know how. The easy-flowing scenes between the father and his daughter (a reserved Scarlett Johannson), his pregnant wife, his new young boss and his office colleagues seem unforced and unrehearsed, as though they were just now happening. The ending, as the characters try to reorder their lives, is not a routine one, but it feels right. In fact, everything about "In Good Company" feels right. The movie may not win Quaid an Oscar (it's not showy enough) but he's clearly on the fast track for one.</p></body></html>

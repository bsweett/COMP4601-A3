If you're trying to put it behind you, then you may not want to see this movie. But for those who loved the show and who like cheesy comedies, this 2004 big screen rendition might be for you.<br /><br />The stars this time around are Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the roles as David Starsky and Ken Hutchinson respectively. Stiller is a more serious character and Wilson is more laid back and funny, even bordering on stupid at times. The two don't seem to get along that well, but they end up as partners regardless as they try to complete a drug sting. Along they way, they get some help from a character named Huggy Bear, played by Snoop Dogg- one of the best parts of the film. Huggy Bear seems like a cool, slick helpful type of guy, but you don't really know whose side he is on. Snoop Dogg is, basically, playing himself in this role. He always has that cool, calm, confident demeanor no matter when I see him on the small or large screen.<br /><br />The music in this film comes from the 1970's, and much of it is forgettable, just like the 1970's were forgettable. One particularly nauseating scene (or funny, depending on how you look at it) has Owen Wilson taking a guitar from his partner and proceeding to play the song "Don't Give up on Us". Most viewers won't recognize this song at all, but it is, in fact, an old hit single from the 1970's by the original Hutch, David Soul.<br /><br />Some of the comedy here is funny, but other parts of the movie don't quite seem to hit the mark. However, the action scenes and the nostalgic value are enough to recommend watching this movie. It isn't the greatest, but it has enough entertainment value to make it worth paying a few dollars to see on video.</p></body></html>

Anyways I like this movie because it contains a really good looking and scary villain and the only actor to take him on is Arnold which I did not mind this time. He does not talk much in this film (which is a good thing) as he tries to create a good strategy in destroying the man-hunting beast. I like how the creature can only see in infrared making it very hard for any human being to hide from the big bug looking creature. I like this film because it deals with the same matter as in 'Alien', in which you the viewer watch a man who has weaknesses try to defeat a 'Perfect Killing Machine' and tries to escape it's powerful fate of death.</p></body></html>

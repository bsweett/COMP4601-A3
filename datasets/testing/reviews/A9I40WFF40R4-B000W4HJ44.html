<meta name="summary" content="Strictly Hairspray"></head><body><p>"Hairspray" manages to capture the early 1960's, makes you wanna dance and teaches you a lesson about racial prejudice without hitting you over your hairpiece. And there is a whole potfull of good actors-- some famous, others not. I'd give the solid A's to Nikki Blonsky who plays the pudgy adolescent Tracy Turnblad, who has to deal with being different (Fat girls don't dance); and Michelle Pheiffer as the practically anorexic blonde Velma von Tussle who is determined that her daughter Amber will win the dance contest. Christoper Walken as Tracy's father and the husband of Edna (John Travolta), who along with Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle give respectable performances. John Waters, the creator of the original "Hairspray" has a unique walk-on role much in keeping with what we would expect for him.<br /><br />Although John Travolta is often funny as the overweight, reclusive Edna, he never convinced me that he wasn't just himself wearing a dress. And at times with all that makeup and additional weight he was carrying around (although he was quite agile in his dance routines) he looked for all the world like a hog. Both Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire and Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie were much more believable as women.<br /><br />The music is catchy although probably nothing Striesand will include in her next concert. The dancing is hot; the movie at times will remind you of the fantastic Australian film of a few years ago, "Strictly Ballroom," both in the virtuosity of the dancers and the farcial elements.<br /><br />"Hairspray" is a good way to spend two hours on a Sunday afternoon inside a cool theatre out of the July heat.</p></body></html>

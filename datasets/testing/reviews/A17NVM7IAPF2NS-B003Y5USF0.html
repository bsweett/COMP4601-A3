<meta name="summary" content="Twisted"></head><body><p>Do you want to see a plot repeat itself 3 times before coming to a conclusion the 4th time around?<p>See this movie.<p>And what saves it the 4th time around anyway?  An endearing old woman who gets hurt urges Helen Hunt to &quot;stop&quot; the madness that is the TORNADO.  While you're at it, Helen, stop the earthquakes, too.  Maybe you can throw some Pepsi cans in a crack and get some &quot;readings.&quot;  Okey-dokey.<p>If you're looking for a dynamic plot, forget it.  It just keeps twisting around, and around, and around...owww.<p>Don't get me wrong.  It is a visual feast, but so improbable even if it does open up under the premise of &quot;the worst storm activity&quot; in who-knows-how-long.  It's still improbable all the same and our bad guy (Mr. Elwes himself of Princess Bride fame) is not so much a bad guy but an excuse to provide Bill Paxton &quot;motive.&quot;  If you can call it that.  Wrap that around a confused separated-but-rediscovering-love plot twist and you wind up with a cookbook Hollywood film bound to please Hollywood executives with $$$.<p>It's not bad.  Artistically, however, it also gives you nothing new.  So...5 stars for brainless action and thin plot...2 stars for a motion picture.</p></body></html>

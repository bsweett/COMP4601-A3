No point going into the plot; you know what it's about.<br /><br />My only beef is with the "tacked-on" unrealistic ending. Bickle as hero? Give me a break.<br /><br />One of the reviewers claims that this is only happening inside Bickle's mind (right after the shoot-out) ...I can't say more from fear of spoiling it for those who have yet to see this powerful flick... I will only say that I doubt Scorsese and Shrader are that clever to have thought of it. Say, for the sake of argument, that that's what they meant and intended...well, then, I'd say it's pure genius on their part. However, I doubt it.<br /><br />I still maintain, unless Bickle is spinning this resolution inside his noggin...it does not work. But, if he is fantasizing...it is absolutely appropriate.</p></body></html>

How's a fairytale town not somebody's (bleep)ing thing!?""></head><body><p>It's a really tough task to make a movie that can be both hysterically funny and tragically sad at the same time.  Don't do it right and you can have yourself a movie that feels uneven and awkward.  That is not the case with "In Bruges," which has to be my favorite film of 2008.  This is a film where the characters and even the location are the real stars.<br /><br />Ken and Ray are hit men who have to hide out in Bruges when a hit goes wrong and Ray ends up accidently killing a kid.  Their boss, Harry, is none too happy with the end results and orders the two to hide out while he figures out what needs to be done.  Laying low is not exactly the easiest thing for these two, seeing that Ken is completely taken away by Bruges and must sightsee.  Ray, on the other hand, can't stand the bloody place and just about offends everybody who crosses paths with him--and let's not forget he has the most abnormal fascination with midgets.  Ray also is feeling a lot of guilt and sadness over the poor little boy he accidently killed and has no idea if he can ever make things right again.  All of this equals one vacation that they, nor you, will never forget.<br /><br />I cannot express how much I love this movie.  It is weird to encounter a movie that has both equal elements of comedy and tragedy.  Because of this, you must sit and watch it all the way through before you can come to a concrete conclusion about the film, and I also highly recommend seeing it more than once.  My appreciation and love of the movie grows with each viewing.  There are so many memorable lines and scenes that will sure enough make this a cult hit within good time.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, the characters and location are the real stars rather than plot.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson make a great team and really convince you that they are in fact "Ray" and "Ken."  And I cannot forget Ralph Fiennes who is both chilling and surprisingly even a bit sympathetic with his character.  The movie is brilliantly written, shot and directed.<br /><br />I have to add that the DVD looks GORGEOUS.  I could've sworn that I was watching it on Blu-Ray.  The DVD includes a couple of behind-the-scenes featurettes.<br /><br />"In Bruges" was an amazing experience for me, and it's one that I'll never forget.  I love it when films dare to be different and refuses to be something where you can predict everything that is going to happen frame-by-frame.  There are surprises in this movie, yes, but nothing that happens in this movie happens without a reason.  I really hope more people will check it out.  It's destined to be a classic, or at least that's the way I see it.  - Michael Crane</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Big City Cop Meets Small Town Justice in this Cop Movie Parody."></head><body><p>"Hot Fuzz" is a parody of hot shot cop movies about a police officer who is sadly ignorant of cop movies. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is an overachieving London policeman with an arrest record 400% better than anyone else. He makes everyone else look bad, so he's promoted to Sergeant and shipped off to the town of Sandford, repeat recipient of the Village of the Year award. Under the laid back command of Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), Nicholas' unrelenting "procedural correctness in the execution of unquestionable moral authority" ruffles some rural feathers. When a series of gruesome deaths disturb Sandford's idyll, the consensus opinion is that they are accidents. With his affable and eager partner Danny (Nick Frost) in tow, Nicholas sets out to prove otherwise.<br /><br />Writer/director Edgar Wright and writer/star Simon Pegg leave no cop movie clich&eacute; unspoofed. "Hot Fuzz" succeeds because there is a real mystery, and Nicholas is a real character whose perspective is at odds with his new surroundings. Everyone thinks Nicholas' compulsive law-enforcing is irrelevant in a village with such a low crime rate -and a bizarrely high accident rate. Nicholas is out to prove that his values are correct and necessary. Beyond that, "Hot Fuzz" is funny most of the time and smart much of the time. It's made for multiple viewings, as you won't catch all the references and jokes the first time. I think it runs 15 minutes too long, but "Hot Fuzz" is top notch parody - not of the police, but of fastidious, busybody citizenry and, above all, of other cop movies.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): Lots of bonus features. You can choose to view the film with a Storyboard option or a "Fuzz-O-Meter" (trivia track) option. In "Storyboard", a gray police badge appears in the upper right during some scenes. When it does, press "enter" on your remote to see the storyboards for that scene. The "Fuzz-O-Meter" displays facts about the movie and explains references in a subtitle below the film (in the black band). There is also a conversational but informative audio commentary by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. The commentary is constant and discusses actors, the references, directorial decisions, and various recollections of filming.<br /><br />Other bonus features are: "The Man Who Would Be Fuzz", which is a 30 second snippet that looks like an outtake. There are "Outtakes" (10 min). 22 Deleted Scenes with optional commentary.  2 trailers. 2 television spots. "Danny's Notebook" (15 sec) which is a flip book not shown in the movie. "The Fuzzball Rally: US Tour Piece" (28 min) is voluminous behind-the-scenes footage of Wright, Pegg, and Frost on the film's US tour. "Hot Funk" (4 min) are some scenes with the dirty words replaced, allegedly for television viewing. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in Spanish and French.</p></body></html>

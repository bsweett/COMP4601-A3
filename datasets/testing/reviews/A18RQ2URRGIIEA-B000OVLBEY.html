<meta name="summary" content="An Entertaining, Action-Packed, Comic Book-Inspired Film"></head><body><p>The 2007 comic book-inspired film "Ghost Rider", directed & written by Mark Steven Johnson (who also directed & wrote the 2003 film "Daredevil"), is an entertaining action & fantasy film.  The story focuses on a daredevil motorcycle performer named Johnny Blaze, who, as a teenager (played by Matt Long), performs alongside his motorcycle-riding father Barton (Brett Cullen).  Discovering that his father has terminal cancer, Johnny is paid a visit from an odd stranger who turns out to be the devil (veteran actor Peter Fonda), who offers to cure Johnny's father for Johnny's soul.  Unintentionally agreeing, Johnny's father is miraculously healed, but suddenly & unexpectedly dies after Johnny decides to leave with his teenage girlfriend Roxanne (Raquel Alessi).  Johnny instead leaves by himself, taking only his father's prized chopper.  As an adult (played by Nicolas Cage), Johnny continues to perform, but by doing increasingly dangerous stunts.  He gets another opportunity to connect with Roxanne (played as an adult by Eva Mendes), but is recruited by the devil to do battle with four fearsome demons, of which one is the devil's son named Blackheart (Wes Bentley).  It is then that Johnny transforms into the powerful, burning, skeletal, anti-hero minion named "ghost rider", along with his prized chopper, which transforms into a similar burning demonic riding machine.<br /><br />With dazzling special affects to bring the "ghost rider", demons & ghosts to life, the film will probably appeal to any comic book aficionado.  Thanks to the acting abilities of Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott (who plays a cemetery caretaker), "Ghost Rider" should keep most viewers engaged even though some plot elements are somewhat predictable.  Overall, "Ghost Rider" earns a weak, but deserved 4 out of 5 stars as it is certainly better than  Mark Steven Johnson's previous film "Daredevil".</p></body></html>

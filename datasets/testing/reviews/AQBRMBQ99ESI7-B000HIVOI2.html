It is very original and enjoyable.<br /><br />An ancient Egyptian artifact seems to hold some tantalizing clues to an alien civilization. The pentagon has been trying to unravel these clues for decades but their progress is slow and halting until they enlist the aide of a maverick Egyptologist who quickly deciphers the needed clues. Suddenly, the artifact becomes the stargate, a portal to another planet. A team is sent to investigate and finds a colony of humans serving as slaves to mad Egyptian god. They must fight in order to free the slaves, protect themselves and protect the earth.<br /><br />The effects and costumes in this one really add to the sense of wonder. They are at once modernistic and evocative of ancient Egypt. The "science" is a bit hokey but the story is a good one and it is well told. Kurt Russell comes off well as the veteran colonel who leads the expedition and James Spader does an excellent job as the inept scientist.<br /><br />There is no reason for this film to be top ranked in anything except that it is immensely enjoyable and it sticks in the memory.</p></body></html>

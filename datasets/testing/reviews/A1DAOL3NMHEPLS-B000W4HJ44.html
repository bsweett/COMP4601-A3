<meta name="summary" content="A bit muddled, but Pfeiffer and Walken save the day"></head><body><p>I've seen (and mostly forgotten) the 1988 (John Waters) version, and was looking forward to this one. Overall, I was slightly disappointed. The movie can't quite decide if it's a light comedy about a teenage dance show, a socially conscious film about race relations, or an over-the-top satire. I found Tracy's earnest social consciousness forced and not believable, and many of the songs (particularly the opener) flat and mildly annoying.  On the other hand, the performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken were great, especially the scene where the two of them are alone in the gag-gift shop. The dance numbers were also well-staged and great fun.</p></body></html>

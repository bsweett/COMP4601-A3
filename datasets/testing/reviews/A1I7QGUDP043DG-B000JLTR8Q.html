<meta name="summary" content="Fairytale quality"></head><body><p>This is a good family flick with a fairytale quality. When a sea nymph travels to land to help men escape some of the depravity they've immersed themselves in, she touches the lives of some very unique personalities living in an apartment building. The nymph completes her mission with the help of the apartment handyman/manager, but her return home is hindered by a wicked wolf-like creature determined to destroy her. Beautiful story!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

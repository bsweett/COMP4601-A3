<meta name="summary" content="A Haunting And Riveting Masterpiece"></head><body><p>With all the emotional trauma, the heartbreak and the seemingly unresolvable angst, it's an enormous tribute to the power of the material and the talent of everyone on both sides of the camera that "House Of Sand And Fog" doesn't come off so depressing as to be almost impossible to get through.  It's sad yes, but sadness isn't all there is here; there are stunning moments of brightness, beauty and compassion amidst the darkness and the desperation, combining for a haunting and mesmerising movie.<br /><br />  When a troubled young woman (Kathy, played by Jennifer Connelly) loses her house due to a government screwup concerning 'unpaid' taxes that she never actually owed in the first place, and the house goes up for auction, it allows Behrani (Ben Kingsley), a hard-working immigrant from Iran (where he previosly lived a life of wealth prior to the overthrow of the Shah) to finally buy a house for his family, with the intention of residing there awhile, building it up, selling it for a profit and the tiny auction sum he paid for it and finally digging his family out of the financial hole into which they've been sliding.  The tragic thing is, neither Kathy nor Behrani are really at fault for the conundrum this all creates, but a heated tug-of-war for the house begins, with the reasons on both sides running much deeper than mere monetary concerns.  There is a ton of backstory to both these characters, and for some of the other characters as well, that is never specifically spelled out but is left for the viewer to decipher, and it adds enormous weight to the show, and even more sympathy for those characters that have been struggling with truly dark demons.  In addition to the exceptional jobs done by Connelly and Kingsley, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Jonhathan Adout, and Ron Eldard have to be singled out as well for their own truly great performances.  Some characters ultimately come off more favorably than others, and one character reveals a real dichotomy in self in being capable of both tremendous goodness and shocking displays of aggressiveness and outright violence (one of which may knock you right out of your seat), a dichotomy that provides real pondering material on what exactly is the extent of this one character's backstory.<br /><br />  I'll say nothing about what goes on in the final quarter or so of the movie.  This is one of the most emotionally diverse and one of the best-acted movies I've ever seen.  Extremely powerful.</p></body></html>

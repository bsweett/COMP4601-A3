That little alien was kinda freaky to look at, but watching it now he's so cute and precious, what was I so afraid of? Henry Thomas should've been a bigger star after this movie, such a talented actor. Drew Barrymore is pure genius in this, she steals every scene. This film isn't perfect but this movie came out the year I was born so it has special meaning for me, enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's not Ben Hur but it doesn't have to be."></head><body><p>Sometimes when I write a review and give five stars I pause. After all 5 stars makes a picture equal to THE GODFATHER or GONE WITH THE WIND, and BEN HUR etc. Thus when you have a light film such as GALAXY QUEST I think, &quot;Can I really make this movie equal to them?&quot;<p>The answer is easy: Most people don't watch movies for artistic merrits (Stop fainting you cultured ones) we watch it to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, in fact if you are not a SCIFI fan you will find it even funnier.<p>The plot is classic, every American knows somebody who goves a little overborad with their fandom (on any subject.) We joke about the actors who are typecast so we know this movie almost before we see it.<p>The characters are great, and the performances wonderful.  (This is the closest thing to a sympathetic role that Alan Rickman has ever had.) Sam Rockwell almost steals the show with some great lines:<br /> &quot;Didn't you even watch the show?&quot;<br />They may seem harmless now but in a second the'll turn mean and they'll be thousands of em.&quot;<br /> &quot;I'm the crewman who always dies to show the problem is serious!&quot;<br /> Sigorney Weaver however has the best one, when confronted with something she has to do because it was on the show:<p> &quot;Well I'm not doing it this episode was badly written.&quot;<p>You can't help but smile here.  Even the actors must have been tickled by that.  She is also a parody of herself in the big chace scene near the end as her front zipper gets lower and lower.  It is unclear if it is a parody of that situation on every Sci-Fi series or if it's just to show her clevage which is still attractive at age 50.<p>In the end Tim Allen and crew of course as humans always do adapt and succeed. It's a fun journey, that actually reminds me of Gilligan's Island, (which of course gets a plug here.) it that its a story of Americans who can make it anywhere.<p>Its clean, its fun and will bring you up, buy it and watch it.</p></body></html>

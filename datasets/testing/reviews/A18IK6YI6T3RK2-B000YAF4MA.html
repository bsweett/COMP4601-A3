The character stayed true thoughout, the screenplay doesnt give a quick fix to what we know are deep seeded issues.  Nicholson is fantastic in this, he is much like his character in Term of Enderment, he is at times funny and at time heart breaking.  Freeman gets the less showing part, but as always he is solid and thoroughly likeable.  Sean Hayes does a predictable turn as Nicholsons assistant, but he is good none the less.  I read reviews of this film when it came out and most were less than glowing, so I was reluctant to get the DVD..that was a mistake, not only did I enjoy this movie to the utmost, but I plan to watch it several more times..if for no other reason than to watch the amazing cinemaphotography that opens the film and to listen to John Mayers perfect "Say", that ends the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Others"></head><body><p>An unapologetically civilized, old-fashioned horror movie that generates its chills from mood and suggestion, not gore and special effects. Kidman's Grace, a controlling woman perilously close to losing control, anchors the film, yet all supporting players excel too. Director Amenabar's eerie set pieces are bound to make your skin crawl. A jarring surprise ending caps an otherwise first-rate spook-fest.</p></body></html>

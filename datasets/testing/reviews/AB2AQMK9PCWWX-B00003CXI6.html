This is a thriller, not a comic piece like Scooby Doo or Ghostbusters. A little more work could have been done there. Pfieffer, Ford and the suspense makers in this one did an outstanding job getting the most mileage and mystery from the story, but, I dunno--I expected more than the cartoonish ending. Especially after Zemeckis and his storymakers did so great on "Forrest Gump" and "Death Becomes Her".</p></body></html>

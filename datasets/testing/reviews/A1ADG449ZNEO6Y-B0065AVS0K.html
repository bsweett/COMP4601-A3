<meta name="summary" content="Visual Movie indeed !"></head><body><p>Sin City is a good movie.It's one comic flick that sticks to it's original orgin.There's no Batmans or Supermans , but you have comicbook characters that have their special powers mostly strength.Good flick , I'd buy it sooner than later.Get it while it's sixteen dollars.Quentin Tarantino only directed one part in this movie , don't be confsued.I must say after watching it 3 times already , I have to say it's the best movie of 2005 next to Batman Begins.I'm gonna watch it again after I edit this review at 12:42 am.</p></body></html>

The director is an underrated genius in his craft and I can't help but wonder if the troubles he faces from studios when it comes to presenting his vision stems not from actual feasability, but from the color of his skin.<br /><br />That an African-American could present such a bold and exciting account of the Arthurian legend, side stepping the Hollywood perpetuation of impossible myth and instead seeking a more historically believable telling of the tale must have stuck in many a studio executive's craw.<br /><br />The PG-13 theatrical release rating almost assuredly was an attempt to ruin Fuqua's box office credibility, when all it did was lend credence to the idea of disbanding the MPAA.<br /><br />Now by no means is this a perfect film, and the overused(although resounding) motif of freedom gets redundant and eventually, annoying.  However, much can be forgiven when each and every battle scene is more jaw dropping than the last.  If you're a fan of film violence presented in a realistic fashion, that's all the more reason to see this version of the film.<br /><br />This was one of the best films of 2004, too bad it never made it to theaters.  Also check out Tears of the Sun, which is another overlooked Fuqua film.<br /><br />P.S.  Keira Knightly can be my Smurfette anytime.</p></body></html>

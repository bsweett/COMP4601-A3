<meta name="summary" content="Very Good, But Not Great"></head><body><p>I really loved the first IRON MAN, and am very pleased that they released IRON MAN 2, so that Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., and IRON MAN (an interesting trinity) could continue their fight for truth, justice and the American way.  While not as good as the first, IRON MAN 2 is still a good, fun, entertaining film, one that my husband and I really enjoyed watching.<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 basically picks up where IRON MAN left off.  It has been 6 months since Tony Stark revealed to the world that he is IRON MAN.  Stark is fighting to keep his technology from being weaponized by the government, still attempting to achieve world peace, and this time, he is also fighting for his life.<br /><br />The returning cast of IRON MAN 2 (Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson) continue to be outstanding, and the newest members (Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell) are definitely up to the task.  New comic book super heroes and super villains (Black Widow and Whiplash) are added to the mix, and are very fun.  The special effects are top notch (especially dazzling are Whiplash's electric whips), and the plot is enjoyable, though not quite up to the level of the first IRON MAN.<br /><br />It looks like there is going to be an IRON MAN 3, and I hope that the get back that special "pop" that the first movie had.  There are also going to be a number of spin offs, most notably one for Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.  Hopefully, these movies, too, will live up to the original IRON MAN.  I guess we will have to wait and see.<br /><br />Overall, IRON MAN 2 is very engaging, lots of fun, and definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first IRON MAN.  RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

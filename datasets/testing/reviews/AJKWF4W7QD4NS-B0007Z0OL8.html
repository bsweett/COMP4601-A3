Team America: World Police begins with an elite counter terrorism squad recruiting a broadway actor who has a tragic past.  As the film unfolds, Team America comes under fire from protesting Hollywood types, as well as evil dictator Kim Jong Il, who has set in motion a plan to destroy every major city in the world.  Oh yeah, in the middle of all this, the viewer is shown two of these puppets going at it, which is one of the most irreverant and hilarious things you'll ever see.  Offensive to no end, deliberately politically incorrect and tongue in cheek, and one of the funniest films to be released in some time, Team America finds Parker and Stone crafting something other than a seemingly one trick pony animated show.  Deliriously funny, Team America isn't for everyone, but for fans of the South Park creators and absurd comedy, this is something really special and surprisingly smart.</p></body></html>

And speaking of guns and bullets, there sure is no shortage of them here.  It's all about a diamond heist gone wrong.  It's not about the caper though.  It's about the bloody aftermath.<p>It opens with the would-be robbers having coffee in a restaurant.  They're smoking cigarettes and telling tall tales and, and even though they never mention the future robbery, they're getting to know each other and doing their one-upmanship macho thing.  Their real names are secrets.  Their leader, an older gruff veteran of similar heists, Lawrence Tierney, has forbidden them to use real names and, with the exception of Eddie, the tough guy's son played by Chris Penn, we only know them as Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink.<p>After that first scene, the credits are flashed on the screen.<p>The actual opening scene of the film is with Harvey Keitel driving a car with a wounded Tim Roth in the back seat.  Later, they meet up with the others, Michael Masden and Steve Buscemi in an abandoned warehouse.  There is much confrontation, more bloodshed.  There's also a cop whose been taken prisoner, Kirk Baltz, who winds up being the victim of Michael Masden's unflinching cruelty.<p>The dialog is fast and brilliant.  The flashbacks are quick and come at just the right time to enrich the story.  The characters are placed in a pressure-cooker situation where their true colors eventually come out.  It's incredibly violent.  But it's the character development that is what is really important.  The acting is uniformly terrific.  And how it all plays out is inevitable.<p>The DVD has some great interviews with some of the actors and with Tarantino himself.  Each interview is less than ten minutes; each has a different background; and each is about a unique experience in the filming of Reservoir Dogs.  These extras were enjoyable, interesting and enriched my experience of the film.<p>This is a groundbreaking work with the hint of genius.  I loved it.  I therefore highly recommend this film for anyone not afraid of copious amounts of make-believe blood and gore.</p></body></html>

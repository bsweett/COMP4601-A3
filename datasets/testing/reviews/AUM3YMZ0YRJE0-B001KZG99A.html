<meta name="summary" content="Great special effects, pretty typical story"></head><body><p>There are two classes of superhero films:  top tier ones that are psychologically real (Spiderman, X-Men) or simple two-dimensional stereotypes.  Iron Man, alas, is the latter, at least for me:  they tend to over-emphasize special effects to make up for weaknesses in the script, have far more action than character development, and follow some pretty simple formulas.  I was hoping for better.<br /><br />That being said, the actors are very good, starting with Downey.  Perhaps it is that he is such a playboy genius type that turned me off, as opposed to a nerd like Peter Parker, who unexpectedly gains power.  I didn't identify with him much.  But he undergoes a pretty interesting transformation and he has nice chemistry with Paltrow, who is as luminous as ever.  Bridges isn't a bad bad guy, but he is lackluster.<br /><br />I did like the special effects and technology evocations.  When he flies through the air, it is fun and very beautiful.  His end fight is also very fun indeed, particularly as he is handicapped.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats.</p></body></html>

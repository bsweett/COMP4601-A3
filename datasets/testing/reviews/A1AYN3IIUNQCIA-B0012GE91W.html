<meta name="summary" content="Another solid HP film"></head><body><p>Like a good wine, the Harry Potter film series are something that grow better with age and the fifth adaptation of the book series does not fail to impress. As many have said before, Order of the Pheonix is by far the darkest (and shortest, go figure) film to date. It's hard to imagine the days of the light and frothy Sorceror's Stone, with its wonderous surprises, colorful displays, and an eleven year olds joy. Now, the series, likes the books, have aged into more mature subject matter, dealing with the likes of goverment conspiracies, war, death, and sinister villians. Now, i will say that this is not my favorite HP film (that honor still goes with Prisoner of Azkaban), but it is still a rather solid adaptation of the book as a whole.<br /><br />We join Harry after the events of Goblet of Fire, the beginning setting the tone for the entire film. Harry is angry, confused, and plain frustrated for everything that's happened the previous year. And to make matters worse, this year is no better. The Ministry has already begun a full out smear campaign on our young hero and the wise wizard Dumbledore, absolutly refusing to believe Voldemort is back, who is already assembling his army once more to strike the defensless wizadring community. And just when he thinks he can find solace with his friends Ron and Hermione and the school he loves so much, in walks Dolores Umbridge, a manic, power-hungry woman out to do the Ministry's bidding and restore supposed 'order' to Hogwarts school. On top of that, Harry must also deal with the frightning dreams he has begun to experince, that may very well be a clue to what Voldemort is planning next.<br /><br />All the performers bring there A game here. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, much like their characters, have matured with age and put to rest any doubts about there acting skills. Returning actors like Rickman, Gambon, Smith, Oldman, and Coltrane are all supurb, making the most of there sometimes small roles. But its truley the newcomer's who deserve the kudos. Evanna Lynch is absolutly brillinat as the spacey Luna Lovegood, while Helena Bonham Carter turns such a tiny role into a firecracker of a performance as the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange. And finally, Imelda Staunton brings the best performance in the film as the diabolical Professor Umbridge. An absoulty horrid woman, disguised by a too sweet fascade that makes your skin crawl. Oh and she also does the laugh justice.<br /><br />As usual, HP fans will have a lot to complaign about with the substantial cuts from the book, especially the whole 'Weasley is our King', so for those who are extremly touchy over this, Order of the Pheonix will most likely dissapoint you. And to those who feel the film may be to dark, it does have some rather clever comidic parts. But for the others, people should be rather pleased with the evenly paced flow of the movie cause i have to say, though i loved Goblet of Fire, i felt it was very choppy at parts, seemingly jumping from one scene to the next in a frentic hurry, almost to try and fit in as much as possible into the time. So for me, i say the cuts were necesarry, cause this film hardly felt cluttered or rushed.<br /><br />So, in closing, to all those picky HP fans, this movie will not satisfy. But for the rest of us, it will still make for a magical time.</p></body></html>

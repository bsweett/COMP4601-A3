Some few people can go back in time to the last eight minutes of another's life. Unfortunately, that includes the event that ended it, so it's hardly a pleasure cruise. Much to no one's surprise, the military takes this technology on as a counter-terrorism tool. It's too late to avert the disaster that already happened, but maybe it contains clues that will help prevent a bigger one. Eight minutes is hardly enough to get started, so Colter Stevens has to take the trip again and again, learning a little more each time, and dying again each time.<br /><br />The action plays well, and plays a little differently in each eight-minute trip (so he can make progress against the terrorist), right to the very end - which contains a pleasant flip. On the whole, this action movie acquits itself much better than lots I can name.<br /><br />So, what's my beef? The name. Obviously, some Lala-lander heard this cool techie term "source code". He didn't understand what it meant, so assumed that it had no meaning - leaving him free to make one up. I could do that too. Let's let the word "scriptwriter" refer to a South American turnip, and "director" be a children's playground toy. See how well that works? Heck, even a movie like Gattaca had the decency to create a new word when they created a new meaning. Outside that one bit of ridiculosity, I really did enjoy this one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If it's not best Star Trek movie, it's best later day Star Trek"></head><body><p>There is a rule that many are familiar with: every even-numbered Star Trek rules. Many consider the 2nd film the Wrath of Khan to be the best, just like the 2nd Star Wars Empire Strikes Back the best(I'm going by release order here). First Contact then would be the Revenge of the Sith(or A New Hope, depending on your tastes) for Star Trek.<br /><br />In Generations, you had the old cast passing the torch to the new one. Here we have Generations' cast first film by themselves and it's quite good. Previously in the series, Captain Picard got assimilated by the Borg, a race that turns others into them and are part of a collective. During a battle with a Borg cube, a getaway vehicle creates a time portal and assimilates Earth in the past, thus present-day Earth is all Borg.<br /><br />So the Enterprise has to go back in time and stop the Borg. Only the Borg picked a peculiar date: the day before mankind makes first contact with an alien race which then kickstarts the science to make galaxy travel possible. The ship that starts first contact is damaged so the crew on Earth have to fix it by the next day. Not only that, the crew on the Enterprise have to deal with invading Borg, who are trying to signal other Borg for help.<br /><br />What films like Alien and Star Wars brought to sci-fi was the idea of a used future. This meant things were broken down or barely working(I still get a laugh after Han Solo has to punch the Falcon to get it working in Empire). Star Trek on the other hand like 2001 looked to sterile, too neat. Generations suffered from this and even here when the ship gets overrun, it still looks too neat. Character-wise, it's showing signs of change like when Picard found out he was the last Picard in Generations or here when he deals with his Borg experience.<br /><br />I'm not a Trekkie, in fact I haven't seen a single episode of the old show, even the one where Spock and Kirk fought or one from Generations. However, I still liked watching this film. Although it doesn't have as cool scenes as the Ribbon and stellar cartography in Generations it's still a good film nonetheless, and most likely your 2nd favorite Trek film.</p></body></html>

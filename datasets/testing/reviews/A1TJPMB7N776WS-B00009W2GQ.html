<meta name="summary" content="A Love Supreme"></head><body><p>With the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, the Wachowski Brothers have found Spirituality: Redemption, Catharsis, Family bonding and most of all Love.<br />This is the most personal film of the trilogy and for that it will probably get slammed by those who feel that The Matrix should only be about balletic fights, blowing up machines or buildings or killing people.  But there has always been a strong undercurrent of Spirituality in all of the Matrix films: it's just that here, it is in the forefront. The battle scenes act as a respite from the scenes of Love and bonding between the cast members: Sati and the Oracle, Sati and her father and mother, Neo and Trinity, Morpheus and Niobe to name a few.<br />One of the nice things about all of the Matrix films is that the Wachowski's have made sure to populate their movies with all races. Their future world embraces all people and in particular Women as Warriors. Niobe, Trinity and Zee all have an agenda and do not hesitate to physically act upon it and in this Matrix this means they save their men from death and Zion from destruction.<br />"Matrix Revolutions" is a beautiful film, filled with glorious images, do not hate it because it wears its heart on its sleeve: Love is All We Need, after all.</p></body></html>

Unfortunately, there's a few serious problems with the script.  The acting is *extremely* reminiscent of a dramatic high school play which means it's hard for me to get into *every single one* of the characters present during the movie.  Everything about the characterization is severely overproduced and it's a major interference to me.  The entire script feels like a bloated mess as a result.  I hate it.  A comparison to a high school auditorium play is honestly totally appropriate.  The acting is borderline unbearable.<br /><br />However, the most shocking aspect of the Wolfman is the way it's somehow able to move beyond all that cheesy and unnecessary play-like acting and focus on really intense and downright disgustingly violent segments that involve a Wolfman going crazy in the woods and attacking people randomly.  Make no mistake about it- the amount of blood you will experience is REALLY high and the segments themselves are incredibly graphic.  Expect decapitations and other intense types of violence courtesy of the Wolfman's sneak attacks.<br /><br />Talk about surprising the way the movie writers went back and forth between two drastically different writing styles that honestly don't blend very well together, which will definitely make it extremely hard for most people to admire a movie like the Wolfman and will therefore struggle to enjoy the overdramatic acting in between the blood and violence.  As a result, most people will have to be extremely patient to sit through a movie like this because boredom is probably highly likely to occur.<br /><br />You have far fetched cheesy acting on one side and sickening violence on the other.  It's hard to be a fan of *both* styles so don't be surprised if you end up feeling disappointed after the film is over.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="VAN HELSING DELIVERS!!"></head><body><p>VAN HELSING, though a tadbit weak in storyline, is a great popcorn fun fest that is sure to please action/adventure fans.<br /><br />Full of hair-raising special effects, Van Helsing is fast-paced and fun to watch.  But the weaknesses were mainly semi-weak plot with Dracula being portrayed by a B-movie actor.<br /><br />But I'll be buying it mainly because I dig Hugh Jackman and Stephen Sommer's style of movie making.  I hope he just get's grittier stuff than the Mummy type movies.  I liked Van Helsing better than the Mummy movies myself, because the look of this film and it's pacing were excellent.<br /><br />Great mix of horror characters.  I will be looking forward to his next endeavor in films...</p></body></html>

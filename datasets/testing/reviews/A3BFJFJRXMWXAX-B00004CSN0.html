Let me count the ways.  The apex of the the film is of course, the incredible bank heist and gun battle which follows it.  I have NEVER seen anything like it on film.  The camera work varies at times from hand-held to steady and that gives the entire segment an heir of hyper-reality if you will-as much or even more so than more famous later examples such as 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Michael Mann is one of the best film makers of the modern era, and in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, this is his best film.<p>It's easy to see how a film with both Pacino and De Niro would be great.  But there are many other ways in which this film towers above most others, many of them due to the amazing cinematography work and editing.  Observe Mann's gorgeous use of color and shadow; the blue tint as Pacino is chasing De Niro on the freeway at night, the beautiful balcony scene with Amy Brenneman (who is amazing), the final scene of the film, the color and tone of Pacino's home, the various restaurants etc.  The colors are brilliant-dark is REALLY dark.  Also, the pains that Mann and others have gone to in order to present the most realistic depiction of the crossing of paths and dreams; these are not cardboard characters, these are (mostly) fully fleshed out people with their own fears and goals and greed.  The film retains an undercurrent of menace and fear throughout, and the action is enough for any action film buff.  How nice to see such a well-rounded film these days.<p>As far as the DVD goes, it looks and sounds quite good.  I am not a fan of Warner Bros. DVD work in general-you know they could have put a lot more on the disc than they did.  But what is there is great-three different trailers for the film among other things.  My only complaint is that there seem to be a few scenes in the film that literally look grainy.  I swear I can see the change in the light and color on the screen as a switch is made between film and videotape elements.  I have not heard anyone else mention this.  An avid film viewer such as myself noticed it only after two screenings, so perhaps more casual viewers have not. <p>This is a film that everyone should see at least once, if only to raise the low-brow standards that so many in our culture have embraced.  Essential.</p></body></html>

For those of you out there, struggling to find comfort in modern movies; you're barking up the wrong tree. This movie has all the things you would want from a black and white movie. Yes, the movie is shot entirely in black and white with a few collors here and there that often peirce through the screen. Blue eyes that catch. That red dress that needs to be blood red. Hair that looks like gold. Speaking of gold . . . this movie is 100% gold. It is the first movie you should buy right when you come out of someone's womb. Start your movie collection the right way with this piece of m ovie history. The characters are facinating and incredibly rich with film noir qualities. The anithero, the bully, the old cop, the corrupt ones, and the hookers that tie it all together. Watching this movie will never get old. It is absoluetly timeless. And if there is one person who doesn't like this movie . . . well, let's just say that he's got a lot to learn about film noir.</p></body></html>

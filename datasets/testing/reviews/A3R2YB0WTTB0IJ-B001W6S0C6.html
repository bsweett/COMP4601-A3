Gotham City is clearly a creation of the artist who will build the world of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS one year later. <p>The problem with Michael BATMAN Keaton is that he is able to be himself only when he's disguised as a bat or hidden in his steeled batcar. He has to wear a mask to protect his face. The Joker, on the contrary, doesn't have a mask ; in fact, his face is already a mask. He loves to work on raw material (pitiful Jerry Hall!) or poison cosmetic articles in order to recreate his satanic smile on his victim's faces. <p>BATMAN is a movie which has to be appreciated for a lot of reasons. It's a really good entertainment, the cinematography is great and full of visual ideas, the story can be read at different levels and, last but not least, the musical score will stay as one of the all-time best.<p>Too bad there are no special features to be remembered of.<p>A DVD zone twilight.</p></body></html>

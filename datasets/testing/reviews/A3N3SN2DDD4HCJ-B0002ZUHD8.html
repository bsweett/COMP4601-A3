But then there are some like "King Arthur" helmer Antoine Fuqua who should stick to their turf. His "realistic" re-telling of the King Arthur myth is a jumbled, dragging mess that features some stunning cinematography and atmospheric music but never feels focused or intense. If we are to believe this movie, then Arthur and his knights emerged from Samaria during the Roman era and served the empire as a sort of ancient wild bunch. The screenplay by David Franzoni (one of the writers on the superior "Gladiator") tries to give us a myth, human story, history lesson and action adventure all rolled into one. Which isn't bad, it's the way the movie is executed that sucks. Fuqua made his name with gritty crime pictures like "The Replacement Killers" and the superb "Training Day" which showed great promise. Here Fuqua suffers from bad scripting and lack of passion. The movie has some wonderful images and rich photography, the use of mountains, green fields and snow creates mood and sometimes you're tempted to forgive the movie because it LOOKS so good. But eventually it feels too long and empty because the characters are not fleshed-out, the story is simplistic as well as the dialogue (which makes "Alexander" sound like a classic work of theater) and the story doesn't have a lot of meat. We like what we are seeing in terms of visuals and colors, but we don't care much for anything that's actually happening with these people. Hans Zimmer should be commended for doing a good job with the movie's score with has a touch of ancient European lore in it's etheral vocals and moody strings. But even the music doesn't help a movie that just feels cold, you almost get the sense Fuqua wasn't having fun making this film. Indeed, the original theatrical version was a PG-13 cut that was reportedly argued by Fuqua who wanted an R version and here gets his wish with the DVD release of the "Director's Cut." Anyone expecting an improvement won't find it. The movie essentially feels the same, all that is added is more blood and a few more slices and kicks during action sequences which is meaningless because more blood and gore doesn't exactly advance what is a weak storyline. "King Arthur" chugs along trying to tell the "real story" behind a legend that feels more entertaining in movies like "Excalibur" and the masterful TV miniseries "Merlin." Fuqua is a gifted director who knows how to make movies, but this is not his best area of expertise and it's a shame his next movie, an epic crime drama titled "American Gangster" has been cancelled. Skip the original cut, skip the Director's Cut, even the most feverent fans of Dead Can Dance won't like this film.</p></body></html>

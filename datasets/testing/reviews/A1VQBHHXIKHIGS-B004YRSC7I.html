<meta name="summary" content="A Fantastic Film"></head><body><p>I see that some reviewers have given away a bit more of the story than I would have, but this does save me the trouble of recapping anything.<br /><br />I'll just say that it's every bit the "instant classic thriller" promised on the DVD cover, that it's both full of action and mentally stimulating, and that I will watch it again, which I've never said about a "thriller" before.  I'm also looking forward to watching the bonus DVD once I've let a little time pass, just to satisfy my curiosity.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and notice how the majority of us are giving this 5-star reviews.  There's a reason we do that.</p></body></html>

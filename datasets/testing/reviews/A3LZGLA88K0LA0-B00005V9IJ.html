<meta name="summary" content="TOM TERRIFIC"></head><body><p>With CAST AWAY, I think Tom Hanks reached a pinnacle of perfection in his role as Chuck Noland, the FedEx exec who gets stranded on a remote Pacific island.  Although Hanks had won two Oscars previous to this film, it is this performance that articulates Mr. Hanks' remarkable talents.  The performance is a brave one; Hanks had to undergo a considerable physical transformation and took a whole year to do that.  Working again with his Gump director Robert Zemeckis, Hanks is required to work solo for about an hour of the movie, with very little dialogue.  It allows the viewer to share in the experiences that he does, and it gives new insight to our romantic images of tropical islands and such.  Wilson the Volleyball is a wonderful addition as Tom's only "companion" on the island and when Wilson is lost at sea, Hanks' remorse is nearly devastating to him and the viewer.  The movie's third section is a little depressing in that Hanks' life has changed so much and his loss once again of Kelly (a sturdy but underused Helen Hunt) is heartbreaking.  The movie has some stunning visual images and the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is great.  Hanks should have won the Oscar for Cast Away, losing it to an over-rated Russell Crowe.  But he sure doesn't have anything to be ashamed about.  He joins Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie) for the Oscar robberies of recent years.</p></body></html>

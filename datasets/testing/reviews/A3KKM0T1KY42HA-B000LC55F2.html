In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.<br /><br />Oh...wait....That's exactly how I started my review for The Illusionist <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)</a> earlier this year. But the intro does indeed work with The Prestige too.<br /><br />My low expectations were because The Prestige and The Illusionist were released right around the same time, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with both, because both were thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. But the tricks in The Prestige are much more feasibly tricks that could actually be pulled of by a turn of the century magician (with the exception of the machine that was being built by The Prestige's mad scientist David Bowie).<br /><br />Don't expect to go into The Prestige and be truly amazed by wizardry. The Prestige is more the story of rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale), and which one can deliver the ultimate trick before the rival interferes. But--make no mistake--the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, as are the diabolical ways in which each rival gets in the way of the other.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan directs. The Prestige is not quite the action-packed, super-hero adventure that Nolan's last outing was ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> ), but The Prestige delivers its monies worth.<br /><br />My recommendation is to see for yourself.</p></body></html>

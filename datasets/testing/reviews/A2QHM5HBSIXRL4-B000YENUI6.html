<meta name="summary" content="Part 2 of David Cronenberg's excellent collaboration with Viggo Mortensen"></head><body><p>Eastern Promises is Part 2 of David Cronenberg's excellent collaboration with Viggo Mortensen (see also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1126G">A History of Violence</a>).  Here, Cronenberg and Viggo take on "Londongrad," immersing themselves in the Russian mafia courtesy of screenwriter Steven Knight.  Knight's outstanding work on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018D3LE">Dirty Pretty Things</a> shows that when it comes to London's seamy underbelly, this writer knows his stuff.<br /><br />What to say?  Mortensen is superb here (I'll let others weigh in on how successfully he pulls off the Russian thing), as is Naomi Watts.  [Those of use who saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CNRRU">21 Grams</a> know that Ms. Watts is without peer as an actress.]<br /><br />The big thing here though, for me, is Vincent Cassel.  Those who restrict themselves to English language films only get to see Cassel in insipid roles like the cat burglar Fran?ois Toulour in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P0XBO">Ocean's Twelve</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1V5VU">Ocean's Thirteen (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  His is the standout performance in 'Promises.' Playing against Mortensen in all but one of his scenes, he brings the swarming, physical, roiled intensity that is his trademark.<br /><br />Want a great movie?  Check out Cassell in Jacques Audiard's masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009OOFG">Read My Lips</a>.</p></body></html>

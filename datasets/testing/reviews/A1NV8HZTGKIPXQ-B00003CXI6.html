<meta name="summary" content="A Top Notch Thriller"></head><body><p>What Lies Beneath is a great traditional thriller along the lines of Alfred Hitchcock. If Hitch had the movie magic we have today, this is a movie he would've made. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star as a couple who live in this great new house. Suddenly, the wife starts getting weird visions and ghostly goings on. She believes their new neighbor has killed his wife. But it is something far more close to home. Michelle Pfeiffer shines in this film. This is really her baby. Harrison Ford is as good as usual, but is given the backseat in the first part. He comes into his own in the last half. Director Robert Zemeckis has concocted a stylish thriller that no one seems to make anymore. Some of the scares are genuinely scary!. They are shot with such grace and style, that they come off beautifully. It's nice to see something like this on the screen after a tidal wave of awful slashers immitating &quot;Scream&quot;. As far as Suspenseful thrillers go, What Lies Beneath delivers in a big way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just what is doubt?"></head><body><p>Let me say it up front: Change is inevitable. The four seasons show us that. But what change? To what end? What does doubt do to the equation? Can good come from doubt?<br /><br />"Doubt" depicts the troubling nature of doubt. In fact, the viewer is lead by the playwright's skillful dialog to question Sister Aloysious as a righteous destroyer. Are her doubts founded? In her best role to date as idealistic, but easily influenced Sister James, Amy Adams shows us the damaging nature of doubt and resulting gossip and outright allegations.<br /><br />You see, Donald Miller is the first African American student in St. Nicholas Catholic School in Boston in 1964. Father Flynn takes a special interest in Donald because he is isolated and intimidated. The doubt begins when Sister James relates an incident--rather, pieces of an incident--about Donald's being called alone to the rectory.<br /><br />Actually, the doubt begins with Sister-and-Principal Aloysious and her strict, stern, brook-no-nonsense way of running the school. One scene shows the deadly dull minimal talk at the dinner table among the nuns. The other shows the three priests in lively, hilarious conversation. Joy and community vs duty and stodginess. The contrast actually shows the viewer the extremes that can exist in a conflict and should warn as foreshadowing instead of truth.<br /><br />It's an unspoken accusation that is at the center of this drama. Is Father guilty or not? The film's tone would have us believe that Sister Aloysious is on a witch hunt because she dislikes the warm, caring, and popular priest. However, as a teacher in a Catholic school where diligence training concerning sexual abuse and harrasment is a monthly event, I understand Sister Aloysious's attention to this duty. What is more important: the care of a child or the protection of a priest? There's a very fine line here and one the playwright/director walks so carefully.<br /><br />Is the priest guilty? Does doubt destroy him? And Donald? As Shakespeare once showed: "All's well that ends well!" Or is it?</p></body></html>

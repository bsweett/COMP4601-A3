<meta name="summary" content="Can You Escape Death..."></head><body><p>Horror movies experienced a huge comeback in the 1990's and up through today, with successful hits, such as, "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", even the recent 'Halloween' sequels have fared much better than some of their predecessors.  However, as good as many of the recent crop of horror movies have been, they are all pretty much the same due to the villain being a person of flesh and blood, the only difference between them is the method the killer uses to dispatch his/her victims.  To shake things up former "X-Files" writer James Wong, crafted a new kind of horror film, one with the smart, sharp writing of the the 'Scream Trilogy', with talented young actors, and very unique death scenes that relied more on shock than on gore.  The biggest difference between this movie, "Final Destination" and all of the other successful horror movies of late, is that the killer is not some twisted individual, but rather Death itself, so it's not just a straight horror film, it's also a supernatural thriller.<br /><br />"Final Destination" begins with a group of seniors in high school preparing to go on their senior trip to Europe, when one of them, a kid named Alex (Devon Sawa), experiences an intense vision of the plane exploding.  When the vision ends, Alex tries to write it off as just a bad daydream, until events in reality begin to match up with events in his dream, so Alex freaks out and is removed from the plane along with a small group of kids, some friends and the others are kids that are mad that Alex is being disruptive and were removed for their threats of violence.  After being removed from the plane, and witnessing the planes take-off occur without incident, the group believes that Alex was just crazy, but then the plane explodes and Alex's vision becomes frighteningly real.  Thinking they just survived a disaster and that their lives are now safe thanks to Alex, the kids begin to adjust back to their lives.  However, Death has a different idea for this group, it seems Death has a plan, and Alex has ruined it's plan.  Now, Death is on a mission to claim the lives of the kids that got off of the plane in order to bring balance back to Death's grand design.  Knowing that he can see when Death is coming due to premonitions, Alex and his soon to be girlfriend, Clear (Ali Larter) attempt to thwart Death and save their remaining classmates.<br /><br />Unique storytelling, solid performances from the entire cast, and a seamless blend of practical and CGI effects, allows "Final Destination" to rise above many other supernatural horror movies.  What really helps "Final Destination" is the fear of when Death will strike again, and since Death is an invisible force for the most part, in some scenes Death is foreshadowed by moving shadows on walls and other objects, this just adds to the thrills and chills.  Another wise move on the part of the director, James Wong, is to not use buckets and buckets of blood like most horror movies seem to do these days, instead scare the audience with the unknown, which is way more frightening.  While not everyone's type of movie, "Final Destination" should not be written off as just another horror movie in an already long list, but instead is more of a supernatural thriller that will at least deliver a scare or two to any viewer.<br /><br />"Final Destination" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

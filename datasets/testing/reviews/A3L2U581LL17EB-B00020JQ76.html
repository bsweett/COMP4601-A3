<meta name="summary" content="Not as exciting or as funny as I'd expected."></head><body><p>Even with three movies released (well, technically four, if you count The Mummy Returns), it's still difficult to tell if The Rock is going to have a strong film career. Reasons? He's not much of an actor and his movies haven't exactly &quot;rocked&quot; the box office, if you'll pardon the pun. But he's got plenty of charisma that just radiates &quot;movie star,&quot; and that speaks volumes more than anything solid talent can when you're starring in a brainless action flick.<p>And brainless action flick The Rundown is, with its generic title and equally generic plot, starring The Rock as bounty hunter/aspiring chef Beck who heads into the Amazon to retrieve amateur archaeologist Travis (Seann William Scott) at the orders of Travis' own mob-boss father. But Travis is highly reluctant to leave, seeing as he's on the verge of discovering a gold artifact worth millions, but said artifact is also desired by two warring groups, slave-driving operators led by Hatcher (Christopher Walken) and the local rebels fighting Hatcher's mining establishment, all with Beck and Travis caught in the middle.<p>Despite the fact that The Rundown is a bit of a return to the 80s-style of bone-crunching action extravaganzas, it comes up short real fast. A perfect example of a missed opportunity comes in the film's opening scene; after a delightful &quot;pass the torch&quot; cameo from Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Rock lays the smack down on the entire offensive line of football team for the sake of a superbowl ring. This should have been a hilarious, wildly thrilling setpiece, but the constant quick cuts and flashing lights make the action almost incomprehensible.<p>After this brawl, the film slows down considerably during its endlessly draggy exposition before finally picking up with a decent barfight about a half-hour into the picture. It's at this point we realize the film has the same basic problem that permeates Arnold's mindless action thrillers; the sight of a hulking hero beating down on smaller opponents just doesn't generate much in the way of suspense or excitement. <p>Most Arnold flicks usually compensated for this with great one-liners or even bigger villains, but in The Rundown's case, there aren't nearly enough laughs and the action just doesn't thrill. Where the film does truly come to life is at the forty-minute mark, when a full-bladdered but hands-tied-behind-his-back Travis desperately has to pee, leading to several mishaps that result in a baboon just hankerin' to fornicate with Beck; you have to see it to believe it.<p>This is, unfortunately, the only scene where the film genuinely comes to life. The following action sequence, a showdown between Beck and several quick-footed local rebels, is pretty inventive, but marred by quick cuts, the obvious use of stuntmen, and an awful soundtrack that employs beating drums and, of all things, a whistle.<p>The final battle is almost a complete letdown, with director Peter Berg once again unwisely editing the film in MTV-style. It's when the action slows down enough that the real impressive moments stand out, like Beck's fight with the whip-slingers. And let me say this, when our hero makes a huge point throughout the film about never using guns and we the audience actually find this pretty unique, it's very disappointment to see the climax feature the hero resorting to shooting down all the bad guys, without even cracking a smart-ass one-liner, to boot.<p>The cast is actually pretty engaging for this sort of film (with the only real weak link being Rosario Dawson, who's utterly bland); I kinda like The Rock, I also kinda like Seann William Scott, ditto for Ewen Bremner, and I definitely like Christopher Walken, but the film puts this cast's considerable action and/or comedic talent to waste. This is an average action film, period.<br />** 1/2 out of *****</p></body></html>

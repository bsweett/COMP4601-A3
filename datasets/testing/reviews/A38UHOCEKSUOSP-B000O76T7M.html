What is odd is that any of the prior Alien or Predator films each had more action that AVP.  And you have to admit, there is only so much you can do with a story for this kind of film, so it all comes down to the action.  That's what we want to see the most - great Alien vs Predator battles.  Be warned now, there are really only two honest battles in the whole film between the two species.<br /><br />Does the story make sense compared to what has happened with the other franchises?  Not really. So if you are hardcore about the franchises and appreciate continuity, AVP doesn't make too much sense.  Predator took place in 1987 and 1997 (keep in mind Predator 2 was made in 1990 but took place in 97).  Neither of those encounters were mentioned, only that the Predators came to Earth centuries ago.  As for the Aliens, we shouldn't really know about them until a long while from now according to the first Alien movies.  Maybe in future installments of the franchise (if it happens) something will come about to make the connections.<br /><br />I was not impressed with any of the characters in the film, except maybe Weyland.  Played by Lance Henrikson, who also played in Aliens and Alien 3 as the robot "Bishop".  There is a connection from the robot to this guy in AVP, but its never quite explained.  The rest of the crew is lifeless, and serve very little purpose except as bait.<br /><br />So it comes down to the creatures.  What there is is great, but it needed more.  It takes one hour out of the hour and forty minutes for the first fight to begin, which was a fun duel and a surprising outcome.  The Alien queen made it into the film, which I felt was a welcome return from Aliens and Alien Resurrection.  This is the 2nd and final battle of the film, when she goes up against the main Predator outside in the snow and ice.  The Predators looked great and tough as ever, but more clean cut this time around and not so rugged as the originals.  The aliens were CGI for the most part, and lacked the fright they presented in the earlier films too.  The humans - kinda just get in the way, but serve to tell the story - such as it is.<br /><br />Considering how many years it took, and a dream come true that this film was even made, its still worth watching to those who are dying to see some kind of matchup between these two great creatures.  Chances are you expected more, but I guess that's what AVPR is for.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Action - 3.5<br />Characters - 2.5<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 3</p></body></html>

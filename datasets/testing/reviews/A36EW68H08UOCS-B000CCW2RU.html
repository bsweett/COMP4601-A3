<meta name="summary" content="Thought provoking Sci-Fi flick degenerates into "Mission Impossible""></head><body><p>The Island has an intriguing premise for the first half of the film, and I was reminded of some of the better parts of George Lucas' "THX 1138", The Matrix series, Orwell's "1984", Crichton's "Coma" and "Logan's Run". A group of adults live in a tightly controlled sci-fi high-rise wearing identical white jumpsuits.  Everything from their diet to their education is guided by other adults who seem to be at this commune to "care" for the inhabitants.  We are shown scenes where these inhabitants are told repeatedly that the ultimate experience is to win "The Lottery" where they are taken from the institute to "The Island".  The Island, they are told, is the last pathogen-free environment left in the world after an event that has contaminated the entire world.<br /><br />At this point you don't know exactly what the purpose of the place is, or what "The Island" actually means, but by the mid-point of the film Ewan McGregor's "Lincoln 6 Echo" has figured it out and brought along Scarlet Johansson's "Jordan 2 Delta". Sean Bean plays the Doctor who is the head of the entire operation and Djimon Hounsou plays a mercenary who is brought in with a team of tough-guys to corral Lincoln and Jordan and protect the secret of The Island.  Steve Buscemi steals his few scenes as an institute employee who is torn between his compassion for Lincoln and Jordan and the knowledge that doing anything actively against the institute is just asking for big trouble.  All other characters have dialogue that moves the story along while Buscemi's McCord has several lines that provide the only comic relief to the picture.  McCord befriends Lincoln early in the film and at the midway point is the character who gets to give Lincoln and Jordan a crash course in "being human".  Explaining about "God" he says: "Well, you know, when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it? God's the guy that ignores you."<br /><br />Now - I haven't said hardly anything about the actual plot, because finding out the secrets with Lincoln and Jordan is most of the fun of the film.  If the film had stayed smart I'd likely have given 5 stars and might consider it one of the greatest of science fiction films.  Instead, Michael Bay uses the last half of the film to stage a series of absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic chase scenes.  Lincoln and Jordan, although only human, live through a few events that would leave other humans not only dead, but with mutilated, mangled corpses.  After one such event a building worker pulls them to safety saying "I KNOW Jesus is with you!"<br /><br />I felt like saying "Hey... what is this? I was using my brain back there..."  For the final half of the film - go ahead and turn your brain off.</p></body></html>

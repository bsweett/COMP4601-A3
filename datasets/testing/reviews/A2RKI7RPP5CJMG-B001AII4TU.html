<meta name="summary" content="Third Time's Still Pretty Charming"></head><body><p>"Shrek The Third" might lack the originality of the original film, but it's still a very good movie.  Shrek is once again put into an uncomfortable position, except this time around he isn't trying to win Fiona's heart or impress her parents.  This time he's been chosen to replace his father-in-law as the king of Far Far Away.  He quickly finds out that there is one other potential heir to the throne called Arthur.  Once he figures out where Arthur is located, Shrek, Donkey, and Puss set out to find the boy and convince him that he should be king.  Before leaving, however, Shrek is weighed down with more pressure when he finds out that he'll soon be a dad.  While Shrek's away, Charming gathers up all of fairytale-dom's meanest villains (including Captain Hook and the Wicked Witch from "Snow White") and stages a successful coup to become ruler of Far Far Away.  Using Fiona and her friends as bait, Charming awaits Shrek's return in order to finish him off and become the rightful king.<br /><br />I think the reason that many people dislike this film so much is that the spotlight shines considerably less on Shrek, Donkey, and Puss than it did it the previous films.  Fiona, Snow White, Cinderella, Beauty (of "Beauty and the Beast"), Rapunzel and Sleeping Beauty all get a decent amount of camera time.  Lesser sidekicks like Pinocchio and Gingey also take the camera off of Shrek.  Even Charming gets ample screentime along with his fellow villains.  Does this make the film any better or worse than the others?  Not in my opinion.  In fact, the princesses add quite a bit of humor to the film (not to mention a sweet action sequence set to a cover of Heart's "Barracuda").  Charming and his companions also offer some fun moments.  The addition of two other characters, Arthur and Merlin, also give the viewer more to laugh at.<br /><br />I'll agree with others who stated that the fart jokes and other sophomoric humor can be excessive, but no more than in the other films.  In fact, jokes like that got the children laughing more than in the other two films which, in my opinion, had more humor for the adults than this sequel.<br /><br />All of the original voice talents make it back for the film, and a few new voices are added as well.  These include Justin Timberlake, Eric Idle, and a few old SNLers.  It's nice to see that SNL's castmates stick so close together.<br /><br />Overall, this film is better suited for the youngsters when compared to the other films.  However, that doesn't mean that the adults in the audience miss out on any of the fun.  This will be a definite purchase when it rolls out on DVD.  I recommend it as a buy.</p></body></html>

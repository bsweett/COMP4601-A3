<meta name="summary" content="Lord of War"></head><body><p>Yuri Orlov is a globetrotting arms dealer. Through some of the deadliest war zones, Yuri struggles to stay one step ahead of a relentless Interpol agent, his business rivals, even some of his customers who include many of the world's most notorious dictators. Finally, Yuri must also face his own conscience. This movie is not much of an anti-war or anti-bush or anti-guns movie. It was much deeper than that. It was about doing things that we aren't necessarily proud of for personal gain; this is something that we all face. Also, at the end the movie mentions that the top 5 nations that export weapons are the United States, France, Britain, China, and Russia. It then says that these are the only permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. That is an interesting fact. I urge you to see this because it is not a movie you watch, it is yourself that you watch.</p></body></html>

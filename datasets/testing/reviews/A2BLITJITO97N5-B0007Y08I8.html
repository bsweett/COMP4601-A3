That being said, the crude vulgarity factor of the film is high (and disgusting). The "F" bomb is dropped so much that I was turned off. Body function scenes don't win Oscars from me either, so the film lost some stars from me over this, also. This could have been so much better if it had been less of a gross-out film and more of a satire.</p></body></html>

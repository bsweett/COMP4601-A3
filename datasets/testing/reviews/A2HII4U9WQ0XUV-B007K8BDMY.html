Tim Treadwell (the Freak) goes toe-to-toe with a young, hungry male Grizzly Bear (the Force). Bottom line: the Freak gets 187'd by the Force, who ends up using Treadwell's guts for garters (according to eyewitnesses, quite literally).<br /><br />Long-haired Hippy tree-hugging dancing fools: Zero. Annoyed Alpha Male Bears: 1. The rest of us: 100!<br /><br />Why? Because crazed, visionary film-maker Werner Herzog has effectively captured Treadwell's quixotic quest in his documentary "Grizzly Man", loaded it up with tons of raw footage, and served the demented---yet disconcertingly touching---story up smoking hot with his trademark fruitbat strangeness.<br /><br />Herzog is a great choice to direct this one, considering the director's long-time obsession with crazy people. And Treadwell is a great subject: a naturalist! a teacher! a hiker! a conservationist! a King of the Sea!<br /><br />By serving as a kind of mytic crystal revelatory channel to Treadwell's own peculiar brand of wonkish, Granola country wild-bore lunacy, Herzog's film serves as a fitting last testament to the man, additionally hooking up a kind of ephemeral shortwave radio into the craziness that---let's face it---made America what she is today.<br /><br />The story is simple: Tim Treadwell---naturalist, conservationist, um, bear-itarian, crazy freaky monkey---loved the grizzly bears of Katmai National Park, in Alaska. Revered them. Adored them. Wanted to, uh, "protect them".<br /><br />Think about that for a minute.<br /><br />Treadwell probably tipped the scales at 150 pounds soaking wet, and a young male grizzly is looking svelte at around a ton, but Treadwell felt he needed to protect these brutes all the same. "Protect" them seems a little, well, insane, particularly when you get a shot or two of a couple of youjng male grizzlies unleashing a little jihad on each other around mating season, slapping each other in a playful ursine backhand that would leave a man's guts neatly delineated in a pile of bloody slop on the ground.<br /><br />And that's when they were just playing.<br /><br />Anyway, for 13 years, Treadwell spent the summer in Kamtai, ensconced in a pup-tent, fortified with some scant provisions, maybe a hand-camera & tripod-mount rig, a few camoflage do-rags, & a small army of stuffed animals. He had a stuffed bear, which gets quite a bit of air-time in "Grizzly Man", and serves as a fine example of what academics might call "foreshadowing".<br /><br />He filmed himself. "Grizzly Man" is not so much the portrait of the grizzly in the wild, or a documentary about the Big Brown One's challenges in the rapidly shrinking outdoors (hey, Evolution sucks): it's really about a wild man living very close to the Edge.<br /><br />Very close, until he slips over. And the joy of "Grizzly Man" is that through the film-footage and through Herzog's inspired interviews (was someone looting David Lynch's casting couch?), we get a very fine-hewn, very stark, gloriously intimate portrait of the man himself.<br /><br />Treadwell let forth his barbaric yawp. He tried to bond with Nature in all Her howling Majesty. He tried to match his strength pound for pound and tooth by jowl with the furry grand eminences of the forest primeval, whose comradeship Treadwell wanted so desperately.<br /><br />There is great tragedy here in watching this Holy Fool Treadwell stomp and fret and dance and rusticate amid the bears, and as the film winds down I can't help feeling Herzog's pessimistic conclusion is dead on: Nature is cold, callous, by-the-numbers. She doesn't do favors. Perhaps intelligence really *is* an evolutionary dead-end, in which we ponder how to save these beasts, this vast forest, this planet warmed, for now, by the furnace of a dying sun.<br /><br />We invite them into ourselves. And they invite themselves to dinner.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

Some of the behind-the-scenes footage dates back to the time before director Bryan Singer was even attached to the project.<br /><br />Routh is wonderfully understated as Supes/Clark.  He brings a quiet grace to the role.  Reeves' performance was very comic-bookish by comparison.<br /><br />Singer tosses in some references to his favorite films in "SR".  I betcha a nickel that Singer is a fan of "Capricorn One" -- there is one element in "SR" that is too similar to a scene in "C1" to be coincidental.  Even his production company is called "Bad Hat Harry", a phrase from a line in "Jaws", a movie he confesses to loving (as many many many of us do).<br /><br />Actually, as much as I enjoy actor Kevin Spacey, I thought his performance was rather unremarkable.  Competent, sure, but not particularly thrilling.  At least he didn't go too far the other way and take it too far over-the-top.  That would have been worse.<br /><br />I also bet ya that even though Noel Neill played the dying widow Gertrude in the film, her dialogue was dubbed over by Margot Kidder.  Betcha a nickel on that too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Feel-Bad Movie of 2002"></head><body><p>Boy, if you're feeling suicidal, this is NOT the movie you want to see- It might just push you over the edge!<p>  The film follows three different Women in three different decades: Nicole Kidman plays author Virginia Woolf in the 1940's, Julianne Moore plays a desperate housewife in 1950's suburbia, and Meryl Streep is a modern-day woman distraught over a dying friend (Ed Harris) and a cheating lover (Allison Janney).<br />Woolf is in the midst of a severe depression as she tries to write her famous book, Mrs. Dalloway; Moore's character, Laura Brown, is trying to cope with her own desperation as she reads the book; and Streep's character, Clarissa Vaughn, finds her life echoing the life of the book's title character. The ways in which these women deal with their problems are disturbing, to say the least, and I had a LOT of trouble feeling any sympathy for Moore's character in particular; Her final solution to her life's problems is loathsome and unforgivable. The performances by the three leads are spectacular, as is Ed Harris' portrayal of Clarissa's dying friend. It's easy to see why the Oscar voters bestowed so many nominations on this film. The revelation of the connecting thread between the Moore and Streep stories was a stunner; It's sitting in plain view for the whole film, but I didn't see it coming. It hit me like a ton of bricks. While not a happy experience, The Hours is certainly a rewarding one.</p></body></html>

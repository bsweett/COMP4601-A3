<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Was Much Better Than What the Critics Said!"></head><body><p>The movie was a little bit dark (the superheroes in this parallel universe literally kill their enemies) but I found it entertaining throughout.  The movie starts with the murder of The Comedian, a sometimes hero, most times a nasty bully acting as a hero.  He was part of a group of masked adventurers called the Watchmen.  Most of the Watchmen were retired but they get together at the funeral and each has their memories of the group that go back to the 1940's.<br /><br />There is also a "doomsday" clock that slowly moves closer to 12:00.  All the television pundits believe that Dr. Manhattan has the answer.  Dr. Manhattan is a brilliant scientist who absorbed a huge radiation blast and became a blue skinned mutant that has the ability to alter his size, teleport and split into different bodies. He also seems to parade around naked much of the time and is not modest about full frontal nudity.  He is the most powerful of the Watchman and is virtually indestructible.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, the story is focused on on of the Watchmen's quest to find out who is trying to murder the group members and the dark daliances of the Comedian from him trying to rape another hero, to his brutilization of the Vietnamese during the Viet Nam war including the woman who carries his child.<br /><br />Nixon plays a big part as he was elected to a third term in this parallel world.<br /><br />I found the movie very fast paced which is the opposite of what the critics had said and wouldn't mind a sequel if one is in the works.</p></body></html>

Yet at the end of the movie, I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it. Instead I felt like the film was merely serviceable as it had all the makings of what could've been a great film yet something or everything just completely fell apart. And also, unlike obvious ones like Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and maybe Big Fish, this is probably the first time you couldn't tell Tim Burton made it. It could've been made by a James Cameron wannabe and you couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />On the orbiting space station Oberon, they discover an electromagnetic storm. They decide to send an ape in a spaceship(despite the fact it's an electromagnetic storm which could very well mess with the electronics) and sure enough he's in trouble so Leo Davidson has to rescue him but in doing so he's caught in a time wave and is sent into the distant future, crash landing on a planet. On this planet, turns out that walking talking apes rule with oppressed humans being locked up and branded.<br /><br />Not giving up, he leads a group of humans and a senator's daughter Ari and her bodyguard away from the ape society with hopes of getting home. But Thade, a nasty unforgiving ape wants to exterminate all humans and he's got a particularly big vendetta against Leo.<br /><br />Is it as bad as everyone makes it out to be? It's hard to say. The makeup is excellent, miles beyond the original. It's got a proven director at the helm, Danny Elfman supplying the score, and the cast is nice enough. However, the cast is one of its problems. To me Mark Wahlberg is in what I call the Bruce Willis group, meaning that no matter how angry or sad they get, their voice and mannerisms get in the way, making them sound bored and bland. What was surprising was Helena Bonham Carter who finally looks desirable, unlike in Fight Club. And personally, I can't stand Michael Clarke Duncan. He reminds me of one of those guys who gets one A on a test and all of a sudden thinks he's valedictorian material.<br /><br />No review of the Planet of the Apes remake...sorry, "re-imagining" without mention of the ending. While it does change things from the Statue of Liberty ending of the original and even echoes the book, it's mishandled and poorly explained that by the end of it, you're going to look on the net just to get some kind of explanation on the thing. Whatever likability, if any you develop, in watching the film just gets tossed out the window upon watching it.<br /><br />Walking in thinking it's going to be a great movie in line with the original will get you nowhere, neither is thinking it'll be a great Burton movie. Lower expectations and maybe...maybe a decent film will spring up.</p></body></html>

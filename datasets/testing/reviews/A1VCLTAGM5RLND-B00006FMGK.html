It was so boring, a yawner! I waited the whole film for something to happen and when if finally did, I could care less. This is not one of the 50 minute TV shows that used to get a little boring with all the talk, talk, talk, which would mercifully end at the top of the hour. This is a movie, they can't make talk fests out of them and expect them to be good.<br /><br />The Captan seemed out of character too, what was the deal with him being so happy in the beginning? And Data, boring, he ceased to be interesting when half the movie was about him and him! Then you had Picard and Picard why didn't the writers think to bring in Will and Will?<br /><br />All in all a very lousy movie. I thought the last one was bad but this one was really bad.<br /><br />How sad, that the advertised last voyage ended up as bad as Star Trek the Motion picture!</p></body></html>

I finally got around to getting this boxset, and as I was watching the movies again, I realize that I enjoy them even more. And that is the kind of appeal these movies have, they offer something for everyone and are suitable for all ages. First, I will give a quick run-through of the storyline for all the movies.<br /><br />In Back To The Future: Part I, we are introduced to Marty and Doc Brown. Doc Brown invents a time machine out of a DeLorean. Marty accidentally goes back in time to 1955, and is forced to look up the Doc to fix the time machine and get him back to 1985. What follows is a hilarious take on Marty's situation where he meets his parents when they were his age, and there are an assorted array of characters, from the ultimate school bully, Biff to the over-strict discipline teacher, aptly called Mr. Strickland.<br /><br />In Back To The Future: Part II, Doc Brown comes back from the future with some disturbing news about Marty's kid. He gets Marty as well as Jennifer, and they go to the future to save Marty's kid from ending up in jail. In the process, they lose Jennifer. While Doc Brown and Marty are trying to get her back, Biff gets into the DeLorean, goes back to 1955 and does something which changes the year 1985. This forces Doc Brown and Marty to go back to 1955, and they have to prevent Biff from changing anything in the past to affect the future.<br /><br />In Back To The Future: Part III, Marty goes back to the year 1885 to save Doc Brown, who supposedly gets shot by a villain called Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen. We see the Doc falling in love with a school teacher, Clara and it is Marty that is trying to keep him clear headed. They try to fix the DeLorean to get them back to 1985.<br /><br />The thing about Back To The Future movies, is that they are just so damn entertaining. These movies are hardly serious, nor are they going to change our lives or make us look at things differently. But when you talk about silly fun...this is as good as it gets. It is such a joy watching the characters we love take on different people each installment, and making the most of it. Something that stands out in the Back To The Future series is the script. It is superb. In the first movie, we are given glimpses of how it would be like watching our parents as teens. Were they as good as they always say, or did they have mischievious streaks as well? These are the questions that the writers make us think about, and they do it with such humour and wit. The second movie is more suited for adults. It is definitely more complex, but the way the writers tackle the issues of multiple timelines and alternate realities is refreshing. It is certainly the more ambitious of the 3 movies. And finally, they went back to basics for the third and final movie. The old west is presented quite typically, but still is a delight to watch.<br /><br />The cast give fantastic performances. Because these movies do not require serious actors, they seem to just roll with it. They give very real and honest performances. Trust me, it makes the stories that much more convincing. They give us a sense of excitement and wonder at what they're going through. Everyone from Michael J. Fox to Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson to Thomas Wilson are impressive.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a fun adventure...something to relax to, something that is timeless, look no further...this is it. A definite classic in my opinion. At a time when creativity seems to be lacking in most movies, it's nice to be reminded how fun movies can be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Refreshing to see the guy feel inadequate for a change"></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson portrayed 63 year-old Harry Sanborn, owner of a rap record company, who only dates younger women (yes, fiction can mirror the truth).  Diane Keaton portrayed Erica Barry, a famous playwright who has been divorced for a few years and never thought she would be involved with another man again.<br /><br />Sanborn is dating much younger Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), Erica's daughter, and the two opt for two days of nooky at her mother's house in The Hamptons.  When Erica and her other daughter stumble upon Sanborn in his boxers raiding the fridge, they're surprised to learn that this much older guy is Marin's boyfriend.  Thus begins the adventure.<br /><br />After Harry and Marin go into the bedroom for a little fun, Harry suffers a heart attack.  He's ordered to take it easy for a while and his doctor, Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) orders him to stay in the vicinity of the hospital in order to keep tabs on him.  Erica's house just so happens to be in the vicinity.<br /><br />While Marin enjoys the nightlife, Harry recoups at her mother's house and, while sitting around, has nothing better to do than strike up conversation with Erica.  They discover they are curious to know more about the other but just won't admit to it.  The daughter sees the chemistry and gets out of the way (although she realizes that Harry broke up with her and not the other way around).<br /><br />In the meantime, much younger Dr. Mercer takes an interest in Erica and she goes from a lonely divorcee to an older woman in the middle of two mens' affection (and I think Reeves was charming in his role).<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I was thrown for a loop when it seemed that Harry and Erica were getting along great and then, boom, she's all of a sudden pissed at him because she sees him in a restaurant with another woman (whom he, typically, refers to as a "friend").<br /><br />He admits that he's not a good "boyfriend" and Erica is devastated.  She channels her hurt by sobbing uncontrollably and completing her autobiographical play, basing it on her experiences with Harry - which he doesn't find out about until a (young) actress he's wining and dining explains the premise.  Feeling insulted, he confronts Erica, explaining that "...schmucks are people, too" and she wants to go forward as friends.<br /><br />Fast forward: Harry retires to the Caribbean for a whole 2 weeks and seeks out his former girlfriends who inform him what kind of a jerk he's been to them.  He travels the farthest to Paris to see Erica (remembering her favorite resturant there) and just when you think they might end up together, in comes Dr. Mercer who proposes.  Erica accepts and one thinks that they may end up together and leave Harry in the cold.  Not so.<br /><br />How Dr. Mercer got out of the way was a little too easy (more conflict?) but Harry and Erica wound up together (and married) after all.<br /><br />And Diane Keaton parle fran?ais tr&egrave;s bien (and from what I could hear on my TV, Jack ain't too shabby himself).<br /><br />Refreshing premise that proves women aren't obliged to sit at home and roll up into a ball for the remainder of eternity just because they're over 25.</p></body></html>

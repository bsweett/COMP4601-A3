<meta name="summary" content="Tombstone isn't dead"></head><body><p>Tombstone is much better than Kevin Costner's "Wyatt Earp" which was released around the same time, thanks to great performances from Russell and especially Val Kilmer. It's a bit overly dramatic at times, but far superior to Costner's plodding script. Kilmer completely steals the show, sometimes overshadowing Sam Elliott's equally excellent casting. Highly recommend as a great adventure, and certainly over "Wyatt Earp."</p></body></html>

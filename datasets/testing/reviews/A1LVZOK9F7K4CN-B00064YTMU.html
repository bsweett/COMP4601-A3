<meta name="summary" content="Los Angeles by night..."></head><body><p>I'm sorry I missed this film in theaters.  To use a clich&eacute;, I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I thought I had it pegged from the commercials - that Tom Cruise is a hit man, and that Jamie Foxx finally outsmarts him.  Not quite.  Nothing that predictable happens in the movie.  Tom Cruise gives a terrific performance in his first, all-out villain role (not counting the anti-hero, Lestat), with a head of prematurely gray hair.  He attacks the part with his trademark enthusiasm, and is truly breathtaking when he is called upon to use violence.  Jamie Foxx is proving that he is quite an actor in development.  Michael Mann, one of our best directors, wisely avoids the stereotype of making the race-card a factor between these two opponents: Cruise likes and respects Foxx, and thinks he is helping him out.<br /><br />Michael Mann's masterpiece is Heat - another film about Los Angeles by night.  This one is not as epic in scope - in fact, it all takes place in one night - but it still inhabits the same world of shadow-people.  One thing that nobody seems to be talking about - this movie LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SHOT ON DIGITAL.  Video has a different look than film, and I'm surprised to see Michael Mann go for it.  It still looks impressive, but it has a different feel to it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spike hits a home run"></head><body><p>This film proven to be a hit at the box office for filmmaker Spike Lee. I usually avoid his films like the plague since I've grown tired of his preaching on race and the ills of this country but for once, he has delivered a solid, entertaining movie.  The cast, for starters, is excellent. Denzil Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer & Chiwetel Ejiotor really deliver the goods in this slick heist movie.  Seemingly a heist film, this film is more than that and thank god, Lee steers away from his political preaching.  If you've avoided his films in the past, do check this one out--you'll probably like it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So Silly It's Funny!"></head><body><p>I read a movie book and it said that some people consider this a comedy, and I have to admit, I have never laughed harder to any horror movie. The way the characters die is just funny! My favorite has to be when the guy escapes the fire in his apartment and goes down the emergency ladder and the ladder stops before it gouges his eyes, he says Oh man that was close and he's smiling then wham! Right on his eyes, and the corpse is still smiling. Funny movie, too silly to be taken seriously, the sad thing is that I don't think they intentionally ment this as a comedy, and what about the end of the movie when they have an arm for dinner, if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, can that be really considered scary? It's stupid to take this movie seriously. Watch this movie if you want to laugh, because if you watch it for a horror fix like its intended, this movie just plain stinks.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AN UNIQUE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE in HI-DEF GLORY"></head><body><p>Two things can be said about this product:<br />a) This is a great film.<br />b) This is a great HD DVD edition.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: The world is in chaos in 2027. Mankind decays slowly and faces its extinction as infertility has been the rule for over 18 years. Theo (Clive Owen), a disillusioned man, must escort through a sea of unimaginable adversities the most precious person: a pregnant woman.<br /><br />THE FILM is great at many levels. First, I'd say it is because of a great cast. Clive Owen is the perfect "zombie", a man who just lets himself go on with nothing to look forward to. His performance is unforgettable as a passive anti-hero who'll go all the way in order to accomplish his mission. Julianne Moore is also perfect as she gives a very quiet and underplayed performance as an activist hunted by the police (with whom Theo was once in love). Michael Caine shines (as usual) as an old hippie who now lives in the woods - in fact, his performance made me go back many times because it is so rich and physical... I really had to see it again several times at certain scenes.<br /><br />The Production Design is a landmark.<br />Rarely we have seen such a puzzling look at the future. It is not Blade Runner. It is not Star Trek. It is not I, Robot. It is simply (if I try to define it) a version of the future which is incomplete... as (like i said before) mankind is slowly disappearing, the future becomes stagnant and reduced to minimum signs of utopia and evident signs of dystopia.<br /><br />The direction is precise and creative.<br />The director really succeeds in giving us his full vision of the story, in scenes that are absolutely great. Using excruciatingly long takes, he really succeeds in giving us the true feel and the emotion behind the story. The car sequence is unbelievable. The old building shootout scene is unbelievable - just to chose two.<br /><br />The cinematography & camera work are perfect.<br />From the composition of the shots to the light in each shot/scene... the camera movements, the focus... everything here is right. I loved the blood drops on the lenses. you really don't see things like that every day...<br /><br />The screenplay is near perfect.<br />Well paced and well developed. It makes all journeys though "urban chaos" look like Disneyland. Characters and situations are very well written. I really felt the screenplay went where the story needed to go.<br /><br />Special effects are perfect.<br />THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!!!!!<br /><br />This HD DVD edition is a combo disc meaning that the disc comes with two sides: side A is a HD DVD side. Side B is a regular DVD side you can play everywhere.<br /><br />Isn't it great?<br /><br />The extras are great:<br />- Picture in Picture interviews with the director, crew and cast. (an exclusive HD DVD format feature not possible in the Blu-ray format).<br />- U control feature: exploring the imagery (another HD DVD exclusive feature that takes advantage of HDi).<br />- Info & Commercials: expanded from what we saw in the movie while we watch the movie. VERY DISTURBING! (another HD DVD exclusive feature).<br />- The Possibility of Hope: a documentary exploring the themes you'll find in the film.<br />- Under Attack: a short piece showing us how they made two very hard scenes (yes, the car sequence is there!).<br />- Deleted scenes (the one in the Art Ministry is my favorite).<br />- Theo & Julian: a short piece detailing the characters/actors relationship.<br />- Futuristic Design: a short piece on the stunning visual aspects of the film (a must see!).<br />- Commentary.<br /><br />This is one those titles that really show you how great HD DVD is.<br />HD DVD is truly a great format. It delivers the goods. It is the best choice.<br />A treasure!</p></body></html>

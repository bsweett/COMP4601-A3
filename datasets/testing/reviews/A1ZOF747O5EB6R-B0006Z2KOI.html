<meta name="summary" content="The Enigma of Che Guevera"></head><body><p>"The Motorcycle Diaries" covers the travels of Ernesto "Che" Guevara and his friend, Alberto Granado, through South America during 1952.  These were the days when "Che" was simply "Ernesto", a medical student from Buenos Aires on an extended road trip.<br /><br />There are two themes that dominate this film.  Firstly, the magnificent grandeur of the South American landscape through which they travel.  From the extremes of the Atacama Desert to the snows of the Andes Mountains to the jungles of the Amazon, "Diaries" is truly spectacular.  The second theme is the political awakening of Guevara.  He slowly transforms from mere medical student to a young man with a desire to change the world.<br /><br />The history of events subsequent to "Diaries" is well known.  Guevara eventually travels to Mexico and joins up with Fidel Castro to overthrow the Batista government in Cuba culminating with success in January 1959.  He then becomes a Cuban government minister before travelling to the Congo and then, later, Bolivia, to ferment further revolution.  His death is ignominious as he is killed in the mountains of Bolivia before being unceremoniously discarded.  His life ends more with a whimper than a bang.<br /><br />"Diaries" goes some of the way to explain Guevara's political awakening.  Gael Garcia Bernal who performs the role of Che is a find.  This young man seems destined for bigger things regardless of the success or otherwise of this film.  "Diaries" should be seen by all interested in learning more about one of the enigmas of the 20th century.</p></body></html>

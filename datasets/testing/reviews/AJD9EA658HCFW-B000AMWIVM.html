Saw is either my first or second favorite horror movie of all time.(competing with the Halloween franchise)<br />Saw is a very entertaing yet very disturbing movie. Unpredictable to the very end. I could not beleive the ending! It defently makes me want to run to the movie store and rent Saw 2!<br /><br />Another thing that makes "Saw" a fantastic movie is the music. Whenever the "Saw Theme" would play, my heart would speed up.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Horror movies you will love this film !</p></body></html>

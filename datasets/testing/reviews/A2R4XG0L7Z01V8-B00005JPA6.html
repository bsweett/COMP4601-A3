This is one of those covers that makes you wonder what the film is about. Not one of those photoshopped romantic comedies. *cough* I don't own any of those of course.<br /><br />Set in 1944 Spain, Ofelia (what a gorgeous name) and her mother are moving to be with her new stepfather, a man who is no care in the world whatsoever, he wants a son to carry on the family name, and doesn't care for his new stepdaughter. He shows it as soon as his new family arrives. His new wife is heavily pregnant and suffering, and Ofelia instantly spots what she calls a fairy and chases after it.<br /><br />She comes across the Labyrinth of Fauno, where the fairy leads her, turning into a green goblin creature, which speaks like Tinkerbell. She meets Fauno inside, who's hiding from the rest of the world, and is a mix of so many different animals, it's hard to describe. She then discovers she's actually a princess, and the princess's soul has been brought back through her. But she has to complete three challenges, in order to see if she belongs with the mortals or not.<br /><br />Outside the labyrinth, the rebels are attacking, and Ofelia's stepfather is trying to discover who the link to the rebels is in his house. The mother is still suffering with the baby boy inside her. Ofelia is desperate to stay and help her mother, but also desperate discover the whole new world that is awaiting her.<br /><br />She meets a new interesting characters along the way, including Pale Man, a strange looking creature, with no eyes in his (its?) face, but in the palms of his hands instead. You've seen the stills from the movie, the mad creature who puts his hands up to his face in order to see. Nightmares, hello! He appears in an almost Adam & Eve-esque scenario. Very interesting, and chases Ofelia.<br /><br />From the same director who did Hellboy, the magic is here, which was touched upon in Hellboy. The scenes are well done, and really stunning, all the little faun symbols you can't help but notice throughout the film. It at times reminded me of my own childhood fairytales, Narnia and Alice for example, but so much more darker. Actually Guillermo Del Toro needs to direct a Narnia movie, that would be amazing!!! He could make the films so good. He shows what he can do in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy. At times, the movie can be almost dreamlike, and the 118 minute running time flies by, and I was shocked when it was finished.<br /><br />The score is amazing, particularly the lullaby theme, which appears frequently throughout the movie, and has been going through my head on and off since watching it.<br /><br />If you've seen this DVD in a shop, and wondered what it was about, buy it. It's one of those magical movies that are one of a kind, and there will never be anything like it ever again. I have recommended it to a couple of people since seeing it, and will keep recommending it. It's more than words can say.</p></body></html>

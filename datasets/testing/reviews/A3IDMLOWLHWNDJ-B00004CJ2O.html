<meta name="summary" content="Freaky "Friday""></head><body><p>After years of being closed due to the result of a bizarre unsolved double murder, a group of teenagers try to reopen Camp Crystal Lake. But, unknown to the group someone or something is slowly hunting them & like the ten little indians, one by one the counselers are quietly dispatched.<br /><br />Much like "Jaws", "Friday the 13th" taps into the primal instinct within us all. The omnious, vulnerable feeling of being alone & yet having the feeling of someone watching your every move. After almost 25 years, the film remains a jolting, jump out of your seat scare-fest that will make you think twice before going into the woods alone, or into the woods ever again for that matter!<br /><br />Cashing in on the "Halloween" craze, "Paramount Pictures" bought the rights to the film & released "Friday the 13th" back in 1980. The studio, thinking the film would flop, just wanted a quick payday & nothing more to do with the film. But the studio's plan backfired & "Friday the 13th" became a big hit (approx. 40 million dollars at the box office & becoming one of the top 20 grossers of 1980) as well as, a major embarassment for the studio (after the films release talk shows, newspapers, & activist groups attacked the film for its raw, brutal violence in the film). Thats why there are no major special features, deleted scenes, cast interviews, etc. "Paramount" is still embarassed by the success of this series (its the black sheep series of the studio). The DVD is a barebones affair with 2.0 Dolby Digital, & a trailer for a special feature. One can only hope that "Paramount" will release a special edition to "Friday the 13th" to coincide with "Friday"'s 25th anniversary. Don't hold your breathe.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Ever Suspense Movies -"></head><body><p>Based on a true story, Zodiac is a psychological thriller gem.  The director is Fincher and he creates a thick web of character-driven plot lines.<br /><br />The beginning scene shows the first murders and the victim's pain and fear.  Each scene holds your attention as the movie examines one man's obsession with finding the truth and one man's need to kill.<br /><br />In 1968, the San Francisco Chronile receives a letter with the Zodiac's ciphers.  A cartoonist by the name of Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), loves puzzles and as a former Boy Scout, he tries to decode the messages.  Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a reporter that wants to advance in his career and looks at this as an opportunity to do so.  As this is going on, several investigators from four jurisdictions ardently look for the elusive Killer.  Dave Toschi (Mark Fuffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) clash with news reporters, including Avery and Graysmith.  Graysmith keeps an interest in this case, and also writes a book about it.  The movie follows the investigation from 1968 - 1984 - a long, suspenseful search by Graysmith even after others have retired, given up, or just want to spend more time with their families.  The thriller is focused on dialogue, tenuous clues, and riveting cat and mouse maneuvers.<br /><br />Zodiac is a satisfying top-notch true life thriller</p></body></html>

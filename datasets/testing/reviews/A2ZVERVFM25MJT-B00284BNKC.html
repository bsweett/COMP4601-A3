<meta name="summary" content="Worrylingly disturbing, sickeningly compelling"></head><body><p>Before seeing this film I had read all the reviews saying how fantastic it was.  Well, it isn't fantastic, and anyone that describes it is fantastic is highly disturbed.  For this is one of the most gruelling things that I have ever had to sit through.  It is explicit, upsetting and totally unforgettable.  But fantastic?  Jurassic Park was fantastic, this is on a higher plain.<p>Although the film doesn't really have a message to it other than 'drugs are bad', it thankfully shows both the highs and the lows of the drugs.  This is in sharp contrast to other drugs movies such as 'The Basketball Diaries' that seems to consist almost totally of lows.  It also shows that ecstasy, heroin and cocaine aren't the only forms of drugs on the market.  For example, the same cut shots and editing are used when Harry shoots up as when his mother switches on the TV, eats or drinks her coffee.  The point being that there are plenty of legal drugs on the market that have an equally destructive effect.<p>Finally, the explicit nature of the film: I found myself squirming in my seat a couple of times and there's no doubt that there are some pretty horrific scenes here.  And as for the incredibly explicit sex scenes, it's difficult to call them exploitive when they so clearly show the degradation that the character has gone through to reach this stage.  This film is not for the weak-willed.  It is upsetting and mesmerising in its sheer grotesqueness.  Yet it is also an unforgettable, important piece of film-making.</p></body></html>

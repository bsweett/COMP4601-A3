English explorer's land on the west coast of North America, near what today is Virginia, and build a settlement named Jamestown. They encounter the Naturals, as Captain John smith (Colin Farrell) calls the indigenous Indian population. Initially there is a uneasy period as the two cultures get acquainted. John Smith takes a small party up river to meet the Naturals. As is often the case with Malick's films nature is brought to the forefront. The inland landscape is like a confusing labyrinth that overwhelms the explorers. John Smith loses his comrades when they go off exploring in the marshes. Like a large spider's web, the natural world traps the men. This is a beautiful, but dangerous world that the Europeans have not yet tamed. The Naturals have learned to live within the landscape. Like a spider that is shown making its way over a tree trunk the Naturals have found a way to coexist with nature, but for the Europeans this is not the case as their situation deteriorates.<br /><br />John Smith is captured by the Naturals and has his life spared by Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). He lives amongst the Naturals for a time, learning their ways. A romance develops between Smith and Pocahontas, but once the Naturals realize that the Europeans intend to stay the Naturals are determined to chase them away and attack the settlers. Nothing is resolved, but many die on both sides. Eventually John Smith leaves the settlement and heads north leaving the Princess behind. The film beautifully unfolds as each new chapter reveals itself. The broken hearted Pocahontas eventually meets another European John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who she marries. Locations are then switched as Pocahontas sails to England with her European husband. She sees the Old World with its tall buildings and manicured gardens, and sheds her familiar clothing for that of the city dwellers. In this world we see nature as having been tamed by mankind. The trees are sculptured and ordered into distinct rows and patterns.<br /><br />When Pocahontas again meets up with John Smith, it is a meeting of the old memories with the new. "The New World" reflects on the notion of change. Pocahontas is the free spirit that embraces and loves the world that she lives in. She's also the one that bridges the gap between the Naturals and the Europeans. This movie is a meditation about embracing life and all that it has to offer, and we experience this love of life through the exuberance of Pocahontas. Sit back and enjoy this luxurious film that passes over one like a breeze in the forest.<br /><br />P.S. This is one of the best looking, and sounding, blu-rays I have seen. Truly beautiful!</p></body></html>

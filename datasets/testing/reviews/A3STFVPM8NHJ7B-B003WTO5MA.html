<meta name="summary" content="A remake? loosely based on"></head><body><p>The orignal movie was not scary and not overly good, but was more belivable then this. Based on a true story is misleading, as you think some events cannot happen, but some events could happen. The movie does have a nice 70's feel to it, but as it being a true story-highly unlikely. It uses "remake" effects to get scares, and that makes it unbearable. Remake effects meaning showing dead bodies in the room with the characters, something that doesnt happen in the orignal. Stuff guys crave to see, and scares there girl friends. I admit Teaxas Chainsaw Massacre from this guy was a little better because you saw Leatherface more, but this movie is limp and should have stuck to the orignal.</p></body></html>

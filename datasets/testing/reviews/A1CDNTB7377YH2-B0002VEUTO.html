<meta name="summary" content="Great Action but not great acting!"></head><body><p>Vin Diesal has made some pretty good movies (Boiler Room, The Fast and the Furious, XXX). This unfortunately, is not one of his better acting efforts. The story has a lot of action though and some of the fight scenes are good. Diesal's character is has a smug attitude that sometimes makes it difficult to root for him. He does have an intimidating pressence that makes the bad guys miss, or perhaps they are all just bad shots.<br /><br />The special effects are not high tech but they seem good for what they are. There is some narration at the beginning that is important not to miss because, without it, you will have a hard time following the story. Overall I would give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.</p></body></html>

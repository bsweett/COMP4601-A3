Well, I was wrong. TDR is a nice improvement over Rob Zombie's first effort. The Firefly family returns, just as vile, reprehensible, and disgusting as ever. Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), and Captain Spaulding (Sid "Spider Baby" Haig) hit the road after the police raid the family compound. The rest is a murder spree, w/ a few unfortunate victims being humiliated, mutilated, and killed. What makes this one interesting is the character of Sheriff Wydell, who is out to avenge the death of his brother at the hands of this sadistic family of loons. Is this movie uplifting? No. Is it deep or socially redeeming? Nah, but it is what it's supposed to be, an exploitation / shock movie w/ a vicious sense of humor! This time, instead of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Zombie draws from movies like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, IN COLD BLOOD, THE SADIST, etc. in order to bash our heads in w/ the wickedness of this trio! Should mentally unstable people watch such a film as this? I don't know, but for the rest of us, it's a harmless enough diversion. Like some have mentioned already, the most frightening thing about the Fireflys is that they could really be out there somewhere! The news is full of humanoids that do not care one bit about anyone / anything but their own survival. Any one of us could wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time. THAT is why movies like this work! There's always the possibility of meeting up w/ a monster and not being able to yell, "Cut!"...</p></body></html>

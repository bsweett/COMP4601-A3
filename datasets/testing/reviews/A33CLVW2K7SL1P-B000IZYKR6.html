A taut, sometimes difficult to believe tale about a pedophile who has the tables turned on him...at first, that is. The director did an excellent job of keeping the camera directly on the actors, literally in their faces, and the dialogue was strong, quick, and intense. It's very easy to root for someone giving a pedophile their "due", even if the vigilante in question is a bit off her nut. Then again, I imagine that most vigilantes are off their nut.<br /><br />Ellen Page - as everyone has said - was remarkable. I didn't know that she was eighteen when I was watching it, so that made her performance more riveting.<br /><br />A little background into her motivation would have been nice, but it certainly wasn't necessary.</p></body></html>

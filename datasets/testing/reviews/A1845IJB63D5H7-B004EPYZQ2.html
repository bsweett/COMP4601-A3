<meta name="summary" content="Missed the greater story for a losing scenario of science fiction"></head><body><p>The title of the movie; Super 8, is truly misleading and could convey any thing but the confusion of the moviemaker in opting to a losing scenario. The movie started great, with coherent sequence of events that seemed to lead to a masterpiece of art. Soon, the train crash added great action and drama that was quickly dissipated by a slightly injured truck driver who should have been disseminated into unrecognizable parts in regard to the colossal train accident. That was then followed by another miscalculation on the part of the moviemaker of allowing all the kids who were in the center of the collision scene to survive. Some of those characters were irrelevant to the story and their survival did not serve any purpose but showing the unnecessary exaggeration.<br /><br />The movie would have still made it to glorious outcome despite the reckless exaggeration of surviving such upheaval. The underlying causes of the train accident would have made the best movie ever had the story stayed away from the frank display of an extraterrestrial monster. Losing confidence in the judgment of the moviemaker made the science fiction less comforting when the viewers should have been eased into believing in a fictional scenario rather than suspecting foul play on the part of the moviemaking.<br /><br />Many car engines disappeared, many missing dogs and equipments, those were still less unsettling than showing the monster closer to the end of the movie, building underground spaceship and harvesting all metal objects. Had the monster never been shown and left to the viewers to guess its features and motives, one could have remained pondering and enjoying the quizzing scenario to the end instead of feeling fooled by the irrational twisting of the events to served no logical cause.</p></body></html>

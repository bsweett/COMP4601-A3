<meta name="summary" content="A fine movie about an underrepresented subject"></head><body><p>This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys war flicks, or who has an interest in the American Revolution.  It is not a perfect movie, but its strong points overwhelm the relatively few week ones.  Mel Gibson does his customary stellar job, and the acting overall is pretty good, and the story is very good indeed.  An unabashedly pro-American movie, but then again what's wrong with that?  It is still legal to make the odd movie that happens to celebrate American patriotism.<br />The thing I liked best about the movie is that it really did convey a sense of what it might have been like to live in American revolutionary times.  It was a long war and a hard war, and ideals had to have been what kept the outgunned and outmanned patriots going.  The Brits are portrayed as the bad guys, but not, except for one villain, as bad guys.  I get a kick out of recommending this movie to my British friends.<br />The story keeps going, there is a beginning, a middle, and an exciting ending.  That's more than can be said of most movies nowadays.  A keeper and a must for any DVD collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very well done"></head><body><p>This movie was far better than most of the shoot-em-up supernatural eye candy features out there, with a cohesive vision and a plot which made sense and built to a logical and exciting conclusion.<br /><br />This unity of elements (probably made easier because of the established comic book) allows us to really immerse ourselves in the world of John Constantine, a demon hunter who's driven less by morailty and more by a desire to buy his way into Heaven by dint of having accomplished God's work on earth.<br /><br />With a supporting cast of characters that includes the angel Gabriel, Lucifer, and the son of Satan, it's easy to get caught up in the idea of Reeves as a mythological figure who has one foot in the world of spirits. There are many great visual scenes, including a demon made of bugs, a shot in which members of a herd of cattle fall down dead at the approach of the devil's son, a scene in which an alcoholic finds himself unable to coax a drink from a bottle, and a couple of scenes that take place in Hell. The sleek action sequences are varied and on the short side, which is just enough to make their presence felt without feeling like you're caught in the middle of a neverending hail of bullets.<br /><br />The plot involves a new development in the ongoing battle between God and Satan, an escalation that threatens the lives and souls of everyone on earth. Constantine is brought together with a cop (played by Rachel Weisz) to prevent the empowerment of the son of Satan on earth, and shifting alliances among the principals make for interesting twists.<br /><br />Reeves and Weisz turn in serviceable performances, and Tilda Swinton and John Stormare prove to be exceptional casting choices for Gabriel and Lucifer.<br /><br />One final note: if you're the type who considers staying until the credits have rolled to see if there's something extra at the end, I would strongly consider staying to the very end of this one. That's all I'm saying.</p></body></html>

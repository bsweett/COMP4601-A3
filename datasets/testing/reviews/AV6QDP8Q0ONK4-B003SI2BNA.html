<meta name="summary" content="YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME."></head><body><p>The movie starts out slow. Jennifer Connolly and her daughter(Ariel Gade as Ceci) move into a new apartment due to her recent separation from her husband. The apartment is run down (you can almost smell it) and has numerous leaks. Her daughter develops an imaginary friend and Jennifer is haunted by her past, i.e. a terrible relationship with her mother.<br /><br />The landlord landlord (John C. Reilly) and super (Pete Postlethwaite) do what they can, but they are not overly helpful. The ex-husband visits the school and hires a lawyer for custody. Jennifer is forced  to hire a lawyer too. Meanwhile Ceci's relationship with he imaginary friend intensifies as she tells Ceci things that makes Jennifer unsettled.<br /><br />The movie finally gets to one climatic scene and afterwards you feel empty. Is that it?<br /><br />The acting was fine. The slow build-up was good, but it took up too much of the film. The climax scene needed to be longer.<br /><br />No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs. A horror movie you can watch with your little girl right before you send her off to your ex-spouse.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pleasant Different Romantic Comedy"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed Hitch.  Smith continues to prove that her really is a big screen actor.  He is charming, relaxed and easygoing in that real-person kind of way.  The best thing about this is that it doesn't rely on a lot of over-the-top romantic contrivances: playing two characters, constantly missing each other, getting too ditzy and silly : all big pluses.  The Kevin James plotline has the silliest bits, but even they are not over the top.  There is a genuinely sweet sincerity in this film, that really makes it work.  Eva Mendes is lovely and more serious than most of the girls chased in these films, Amber Valleta proves that she can actually deliver dialogue without being laughed at and James is the comically sweet loser/everyman.  Actually very well done.  One kind of comic nod to the old romatic comedies is a remote control Smith has in his apartment ala Rock Hudson in Pillow Talk - but it is quick and not an extended silly joke.  Definitely worth your time.</p></body></html>

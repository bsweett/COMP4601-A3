<meta name="summary" content="A Triumph of Substance over Style"></head><body><p>Horror movies today fall into distinctly one of two categories: Dumb and Good. Lately we horror fans have had a sort of Garden Of Delights, with movie upon movie being released in rapid succession. The trouble with this is that the majority of these releases fall squarely into the &quot;Dumb&quot; category (Wrong Turn, 13 Ghosts, Jeepers Creepers 2, The (new) Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and while they may be relatively entertaining, it is possible to sit through them all without even breaking a mild sweat.<br /><br /> Far rarer today are those movies that hearken back to the golden era of Horror - movies like &quot;The Blair Witch project&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot; and &quot;Ringu&quot; invoking memories of such classics as &quot;Don&quot;t look Now&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; - and these movies garner critical acclaim, as their three-decades-old counterparts did upon their first release, too.<br /><br /> The reason? Substance over Style. Look closely at any of the more recent critically acclaimed Horror flicks and you'll see a common trend - no oceans of blood, no deformed humanoids wielding axes, no silvery-white transparent blue-screen ghosties. Just solid acting, excellent direction and excellent production. Real Actors with Real Characters to portray in settings that are... ...well, just real.<br /><br /> &quot;The Exorcist&quot; falls firmly into this category; it is the original triumph of Substance over Style. There are no hi-end special effects here, nor is there any Hollywood Overstatement to muck up the proceedings with. For that reason alone the excellent performances, beautifully shot direction and exquisite scoring are allowed to shine through, and the movie is today, a whopping 31 years after its original release, and every bit as compelling and powerful as it was back in 1973.<br /><br /> The plot centres on Regan MacNeill (Linda Blair), the daughter of acclaimed actress Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn). A series of out-of-character episodes and violent behaviour lead her through a maze of conventional doctors to a Jesuit priest, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Recognising that she is possessed by a demon, the Church summons experienced Exorcist Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) to rid the child of her evil occupant.<br /><br /> It is a strong testament to the superficiality of the modern Academy Awards system that Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. Here is a performance with depth, truth and believability - she is a Mother, she is on the Edge. Burstyn's remarkable talent shines through in this picture and the fear and tension she herself creates is alone worthy of praise. Blair as Regan is good, she is a perfectly sweet and innocent creature as Regan, and in the scenes where she is being taken over by Pazuzu (the Demon), she displays a rare talent in child actors - the ability to create drama without histrionics. Miller as Karras is similarly excellent as the tortured, moody priest wrestling with his faith, and the scenes between him and his elderly Mother are simultaneously tender and grim. Von Sydow does a good job with the role of Merrin, but he's somewhat peripheral to the central core of the story.<br /><br /> Direction is superior. William Friedkin has used a sharp, choppy style of camerawork to suggest violence born out of normality, and it works beautifully here. The Party and medical Examination scenes set a wonderful tone for the last half of the movie, and the floaty, unstructured quality of Karras' Dream Sequence is a beautiful, haunting piece of film. The opening scenes in Iraq and the Exorcism itself draw some interesting parallels - monochromatic and stark, they compliment each other nicely and, in and of themselves, are excellent 'ends' to the movie.<br /><br /> The score is perfect, animal voices and sharp strings (as well as Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of Pazuzu, check her out alongside Joan Crawford in spaghetti western &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;) add an aural tension that's rarely been matched, and the whole production screams of professionalism. Here are masters of their Craft, and we're thrilled to be along for the ride.<br /><br /> The special effects may look hokey in places now, but this is directly the fault of those delightful Wayans boys and Mister Leslie Nielsen, legally plagiarising the Bile and Head-Turning scenes for their own juvenile ends.<br /><br /> The extra material is good, the 'Spider-Walk' scene is particularly grim, and the picture and sound quality are excellent. The extras on the DVD are nice, but they're not the point.<br /><br /> All in all, this is one of the most well-realised horror movies of all-time. Following the novel almost to the letter, and providing deep-fear immersion, I can highly recommend &quot;The Exorcist&quot; to all that are sick of seeing old &quot;Buffy&quot; cast members having their nipples photographed by Modern Hollywood.<br /><br /> Excellent.</p></body></html>

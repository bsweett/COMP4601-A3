Gruesome best describes the movie.  You may feel as if the movie is never going to start, and I literally thought, "ok, ok, you are trying to establish tension between the two chics and the due....fine, get ON with it...."  However, after the initial scenes which get the movie off to a slow start (though camera trickery is used to attempt to overcome this problem), the movie actually begins.<br /><br />Once the movie truly starts, and the basic plot lines are established (character tension, etc.), the movie sucked me in, grabbed me by the gonads, and didn't let go.  Once the Freddy Kruger of Australia enters the story, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />I was very surprised by the gruesome and horrific scenes in this movie.  I review <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078401213X">Pi</a> as "Disturbing," but that was on a different level.  Wolf Creek is truly Disturbing, because of the detail of the horrific scenes, the cold blooded ruthlessness....but even more so because it seems so real.  This movie leaves you wondering about solo hiking trips and other adventures.  Can't say I'll be touring Australia any time soon.<br /><br />If you like the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJU1KK">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning - Unrated (New Line Platinum Series)</a> movies, you will probably enjoy Wolf Creek.</p></body></html>

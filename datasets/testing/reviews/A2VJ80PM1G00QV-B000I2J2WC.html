<meta name="summary" content="Same Failings as the Book"></head><body><p>I had read-(listened to audio-book)-at least one Dan Brown book previous to this one.  It was OK; an ordinary thriller-mystery.<br />This book was no different, although a more ambitious work: an OK thriller, with a good deal more tedious filler between the action scenes. Oh, yes, I understand that it was the filler (and the usual self-fulfilling process, being hugely successful creates a momentum of public sentiment, which makes something even more hugely successful) that drew in the customers. Given the densely packed  gobble-de-gook of the book, it is a wonder that the writers were able to find anything much to film. Nevertheless, of course, it was filmed. Don't know how it did at the box office; however, the film was the same mediocre story-telling as was the book. Spurts of action, a very mild, almost non-existent romance, and, what often seemed to be endless, senseless chatter. Hammett, did it worlds better, in his novel, The Maltese Falcon, as did the the makers of the Cortez and Bogart filming. It took them only a few minutes to give us all we wanted to know about the history of the Black Bird, and they never let it get in the way of the story.<br />I have only sympathy for Tom Hanks, Ron Howard and the other key figures in the making of the film. No doubt, the money was good; but the artistic ambitions went for naught. All have done a lot better.</p></body></html>

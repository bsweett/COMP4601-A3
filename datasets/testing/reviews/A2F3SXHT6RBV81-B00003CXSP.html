The suspense may keep one on edge, with the scary music, but personally I was disappointed with this production.<p>This may be the sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it is not in the same class.  That one, I liked!<p>Anthony Hopkins (whom my late friend, Roz Mahoney, called 'Tony') is one of my favorite actors.  He is marvelous in anything he attempts.  He's made a multitude of entertaining films enjoyed by a vast, diverse audience of all ages.</p></body></html>

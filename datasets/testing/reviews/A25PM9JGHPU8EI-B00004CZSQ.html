I, too, was swayed to check it out after hearing about its "legendary" status as one of the greatest ever made. It's just not true. It's unintentionally hilarious in many scenes. About the only positive comments I can offer are for the effective use of extreme color and an interesting soundtrack. Otherwise - a waste of time. Watch "Dead Alive", instead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Extremely Funny for Satire and Cohen Fans... Not So Much For Everyone Else"></head><body><p>First and foremost, if you are a parent of a child under 18 spare yourself the anguish and kicking yourself in the rear by not taking your kids to see this,  The same goes for everyone who thinks they'll be offended by it; chances are you will be offended.  In the theatre I saw Borat in, half the audience was laughing or on the floor while the more conservative audience (usually non-college student adults and older viewers) berated us for laughing at the racial and sexist jokes that clutter Borat.<br /><br />I will admit, Borat goes well over the top in both crude humor and imagry.  The one scene that comes to mind involves wrestling between a naked Borat and his overly obese producer... who is also naked and the fight tends to meander... a lot.  At this point I covered my eyes (while laughing hysterically) and kept demanding the movie Gods to make it stop.  The showing of the full-frontal nudity in males happens twice and while it is seemingly hysterical to myself and other Cohen fans, the general audience in the theatre just gagged or walked out.<br /><br />As for being whitty and satiracle, I found Borat to be hilarious.  I will not say American culture involves inherant violence and desires to kill all people of Iraq (as Borat more or less "proved" during the Rodeo scene), but he certainly brought out the worst in everyone he encountered.  The scene where he visits a gun shop to get "protection from Jews," the owner just stands there and changes the subject.  Many saw this as condoning the act when the guy was simply trying to be polite and not cause any trouble.<br /><br />Borat does a great job of taking social norms and taboos and throwing them right into the face of Americans.  For instance, he tries to be friendly on a subway only to be threatened by everyone he encounters and given the social norms in NY, this certainly makes it all the more funny.  Another social norm turned upside down is his treatment of women; when attending a feminist meeting he laughs at the feminists and brings up "research" that women's brains are smaller and keeps refering to one feminist as a guy.<br /><br />Pertaining to the candid-camera aspect and the controversy thereof; while I sympathize with the people he was extremely rude to such as the dining society... let's think about this.  If someone acting incredibly stupid shows up with a camera screw and is well-financed; he's either a friend of George Soros or it's a prank.  The fraternity guys claimed they were duped into thinking it was a documentary on the fraternity system and yet they didn't question why a guy from Kazachkstan was doing the filming and he was incredibly stupid.  Not to mention one has to know if he's being filmed and with technology today (particularly youtube etc) the film is going to be distributed.<br /><br />I loved the story; Borat is trying to find Pamela Anderson to make him his wife and it was obvious that one scene where he meets her is staged... but still funny.  Borat encounters many funny figures along the way and his usual antics such as loving women will make crude humor fans laugh.  One of Borat's obvious querps is his disdain for Jews (Cohen is a Jew himself) and the encounter with a Jewish couple at a bed and breakfast, who tried to be very sweet (although it seemed as though it was staged) and trigger the Blair-Witch Project scene that follows.<br /><br />Again, this is very crude humor appealing to college students, teenagers and Cohen fans like myself.  DO NOT SEE THIS is you think you will be offended or are easily offended.  Cannot stress this enough; which does force me to ding Borat to 4-stars because while I found Borat to be a five-star in my book, it does not appeal to the general audience.  This film was very entertaining for my friends and I to see and was worth the wait; we will get the DVD when it comes out as well.</p></body></html>

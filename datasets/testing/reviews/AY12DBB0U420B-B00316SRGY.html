<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood As An Aging Curmudgeon. Well Worth Watching."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was Gran Torino starring Clint Eastwood. This one came from the 5-dollar rack at Wall-Mart and was quite a good movie. Of course, I've always liked Clint Eastwood and have a big collection of his movies. In this movie, Eastwood appeared quite old. He played a veteran of the Korean War, and his true age is just about right for the part.<br /><br />Eastwood lived in a decaying part of an older big city. His wife had died and he was now all alone. Most of the original residents of his neighborhood were gone and the new wave of people were mostly Asian. Some Hmung people lived next door, much to his dislike, and the area was plagued with gangs. The "Gran Torino" of the title was for an aging but very-well-kept-up 1972 Pontiac he had stored in his garage. The car was coveted by some of the young hoods of the neighborhood. Eastwood was the old Eastwood and had a few guns and issued a few Eastwood-type threats that kept the hoods at a distance.<br /><br />Eastwood was an aging curmudgeon and angry with seemingly everything in the modern world. Several times he helped the next door family out of threatening situations, for which they were very pleased, and they gradually and grudgingly became friends. Eastwood befriended the young boy and trained him and helped him to get a construction job. It was an uplifting story, probably played over and over in modern America, and well worth watching. Everything about the movie was first rate, but I'd expect that with an Eastwood movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

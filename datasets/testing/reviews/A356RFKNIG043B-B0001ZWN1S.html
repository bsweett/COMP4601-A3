The performances are stunningly good (Brando, Pacino, Duvall, and Caan were all Oscar-worthy here), the script a genius retelling of the epic novel, and Coppola knocks it out of the park with his flawless eye for framing emotions.<br /><br />Inspired in every sense of the word, The Godfather is peerless, except for Godfather 2, which is somehow almost as good (and where Pacino enters the Pantheon).<br /><br />The music, the colors, the darkness and chiaroscuro, the overall feeling of being in the midst of greatness on every level...this is what moviemaking can be. The bar was raised with this one, and in some ways only Apocalypse Now has topped it since.<br /><br />Coming on the heels of Coppola's incredibly dull The Conversation, this film seems even more miraculous. G 1, G 2, and Apocalypse, all in less than eight years; how many directors have had a hat trick like that?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Illusionist"></head><body><p>Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton) is taking Vienna by storm.  The year is 1900, and Eisen heim is so talented that his tricks are so good that his audience believes him to be supernatural.  In fact, they may not be wrong.  Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell) is a doubter though, and he gives Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) the task of proving him a fraud.  At a performance, Leopold sends his fianc&eacute;e Princess Sophie (Biel) to the stage as a volunteer.  Little does he know that Sophie and Eisenheim were in love as children, and this reunion will rekindle their romance.  This only intensifies Leopold's determination to end Eisenheim's act for good.<br /><br />Edward Norton is perfect as Eisenheim.  He makes the character likeable and even a little mysterious.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, Rufus Sewell makes Leopold a character that is easy to hate.  Biel and Giamatti deliver solid supporting performances as well.  The story is great, keeping the audience guessing about Eisenheim's gifts until the final minutes.  I recommend finding a theater near you that is playing "The Illusionist", and check it out.</p></body></html>

God gave him a musical gift, not heroin, as some reviewers suggest. The evil one comes to steal, kill, and destroy - not to create.<br /><br />I had forgotten that he was such a crossover sensation: his songs topped the charts of R&B, Pop, and Country music. Who is like him in this way?<br /><br />All in all, though, I am left with an aching emptiness for Ray -the pain and regret from the years of infidelity to his wife, estrangement from his family, being cheated by those he trusted most, tortured by drug addiction. I was left wondering in the midst of his despair, did he ever find the peace and love and joy in the Lord that he longed for?</p></body></html>

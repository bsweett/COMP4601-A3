Aeon Flux sucked.  Catwoman sucked.  At least here you see the heroine kick ass, in a tight costume, with hoards of weapons, for MOST of the movie.  And, get this, she actually kills people in this movie--doesn't just knock them unconscious in deference to our violence loving society.  Hopefully the extended cut will offer even more.  What more do you want?</p></body></html>

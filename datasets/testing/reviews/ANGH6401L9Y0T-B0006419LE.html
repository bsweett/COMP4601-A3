Not too surprising when you remember that the last movie ended with the Doomsday Bomb. We did not learn until the start of this movie that Zira (Kim Hunter), Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo) had retrieved Taylor's space ship from the lake he had originally landed in, repaired it, and escaped just before the planet blew up. They land in the US circa 1973, and of course astonish everyone with their ability to talk, and their civilized ways.<br /><br />But things are not all just diplomatic receptions and amusements. One doctor, an adviser to the president, gets Zira drunk and gets her talking about their lives in the distant future, and concludes that he must alter the future by not allowing the child that Zira is going to have to survive. This sets up a chase and rescue plot line that leads to a circus run by Ricaldo Montelbaum. Toward the end, Zira mentions that she only learned to trust three people in the time they were there. Presumably these were the two doctors from the zoo to which they were first taken, and Montelbaum.<br /><br />What's fun about this movie is that it completely reverses the focus of the first two. There, apes were everywhere and only a very few humans could talk. Here, humans are everywhere and only three (two, once Dr. Milo is killed by a gorilla) are able to talk. One of my favorite scenes is watching Cornelius and Zira get outfitted in top fashion clothing, apparently from Rodeo Drive.<br /><br />Just in case there are two or three people out there who have not seen the whole series, I am not going to tell you the ending, and how it sets up the next film's plot.</p></body></html>

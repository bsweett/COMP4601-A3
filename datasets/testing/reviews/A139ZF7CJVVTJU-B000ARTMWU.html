<meta name="summary" content="When Bad Endings Happen To Good Movies"></head><body><p>The French horror film "High Tension" is actually two movies, and one of them sucks.  If you want to watch the four-star version, skip the first fifteen seconds after the opening credits, and turn the DVD player off right after the greenhouse scene near the end of the film.  If you let it play any longer, I guarantee you that what previously made sense will cease to.<br /><br />The movie has two climaxes, two resolutions, and two narrative threads, and only one of them has any entertainmnet value.  The first story has legs, and it uses them to pace with sure footing through some standard (but cunningly utilized) horror movie moments.  The second story, however, takes two plot twists and applies them directly to both of the movie's ankles, giving the audience a hopelessly crippled mess that only barely manages to drag itself to a reasonable finish line.<br /><br />I could go into the plot twists, but that would ruin the movie (so to speak).  The most I'll say is that, while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">these</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002234LS">types</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00092ZLSK">of</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008EY9G">twists</a> have formed the backbone of some seriously excellent films, they have since been worked to death by an industry that has begun to confuse inventiveness with inanity.  And are they, for the most part, even necessary?<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9HH">some</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">cases</a>, absolutely.  In this case: are you kidding me?<br /><br />It's a shame, too.  The beginning to Alexandre Aja's film is riveting and unsettling.  Two college friends, Marie and Alexa, go on a study-vacation to Alexa's parents' country home, but they hardly get to crack a book before a mysterious murderer enters the picture and starts cracking other things.  Skulls, for example.  The entire sequence that occurs in the house is brilliantly done, and gives the title of the film some serious credit.<br /><br />The power of the plot dwindles a bit when the story hits the road.  The central character, Marie (a talented Cecile De France), sweats and schemes her way out of the house in an attempt to escape the killer or at least find help, and the audience is with her the whole way.  However, the raspy-lunged, creepily-methodical killer absconds with Alexa, and Marie becomes bent on saving her friend and avenging the deaths she's witnessed.  It's a not-entirely-acceptable personality shift, but in light of the even more ridiculous shifts to come, its passable.<br /><br />More than passable, the core of the film is actually pretty darn absorbing.  Cecile plays the tortured heroine with just enough off-the-cuff intelligence and fault-the-fear stupidity to hold the helm as the Leading Lady.  It's too bad that her contributions to the story (and even Aja's bewitching directing) are buried under last minute theatrics.  There's a good movie here, to be sure.  But, like a supermodel in a gorilla suit, this film's seductive center is wrapped in something stupid, fake, and rented.</p></body></html>

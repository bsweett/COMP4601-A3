<meta name="summary" content="Didn't Do A Lot For Me"></head><body><p>The reviews posted here tell about a brilliant satire that explores and reveals great subjects, grand topics, and enormous themes. I believed every one of the reviews, which are brilliant in themselves, but I didn't find the movie at all the kind of film that informs and enlightens. I loved the comedy, the acting, the wild story line, the goofy antics and odd displays of maladjustment, but I didn't get the feeling that great truths were being explored. The grandfather character was played so well by Alan Arkin that I began immediately to say the big "O" word, Oscar. His every gesture and expression is the work of a master comic actor. About half way into the movie, I got tired, though, and after the grandfather dies, I lost interest in the film altogether. Frankly, I didn't like them very much and only cared about the old man. The silent son was interesting until he opened his mouth, and then he seemed very ordinary. The parents were awful, the road trip became terribly long, and the arrival scene in LA seemed suddenly too goofy, as they drove over the flower-beds and through gate posts, I really wondered where the police were and figured, as a life-long LA resident, that they would have been shot after 10 minutes of that kind of craziness. So, yes to the acting, and yes to Arkin, and yes to the idea, but I'm happy not to have to see any of those awful people again.</p></body></html>

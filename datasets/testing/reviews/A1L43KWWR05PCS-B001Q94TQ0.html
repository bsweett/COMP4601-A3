<meta name="summary" content="FROM PLANTATION TO EXPLOITATION..."></head><body><p>This is an outstanding independent film by director-writer Joshua Marston that has received excellent critical reviews and caused quite a stir at various film festivals, winning the 2004 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award,  and garnering a 2004 Best Actress award at the Berlin Film Festival for newcomer Catalina Sandino Moreno. Filmed in Spanish with subtitles, it is definitely a must see film.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a beautiful, headstrong teenager, Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno), who lives in a rural area of Columbia with limited opportunities. She works on a flower plantation and helps to support her mother, her sister, and her sister's out-of-wedlock baby. She has a best friend, Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega), and a boorish boyfriend, Juan (Wilson Guerrero). All of them have limited futures, and Maria seems to sense that she is definitely on the road to nowhere.<br /><br />Maria is sick of her demanding family, as she sees that her sister, who does nothing to contribute to her family's welfare, is treated better by their mother than she is. Maria is also tired of her job at the flower plantation, where she is treated little better than a serf. Pregnant by her boyfriend but unwilling to enter into a loveless marriage with him, she is introduced to Franklin (John Alex Toro), a seemingly more worldly young man than she is accustomed to meeting.  It is he who introduces her to the high risk job of being a drug mule to the United States. The money, five thousand dollars, is far more than Maria is accustomed to earning, and, suddenly, the inherent risks seem to fade into the background.  It seems to the pregnant Maria that the whole world could be her oyster.<br /><br />The film gives a very explicit birds-eye view of the life as a drug mule. It shows the viewer just how the process works, from the swallowing of the encapsulated drugs to their eventual evacuation from the drug mule's body. It also shows what can happen when the drugs leak into the mule's system.  Of course, when dealing with illicit drugs, one is also forced into interacting with drug dealers. In her brief career as a drug mule, Maria is faced with all of these situations, as is her best friend, Blanca, who against Maria's advice, also makes the journey to the United States, stomach bloated with drugs, along with two other girls.<br /><br />Once in flight, there are signs of things not going as smoothly as planned. When they land, further complications arise. These increase, once they are in the drug dealer's lair, and the evacuation process begins. Unfortunately, the worst case scenario presents itself, and Maria reacts in a way that has the potential for extreme ramifications for her and her family. Maria, however, is a survivor by nature. When the danger is averted, and the time comes for her return home, Maria makes a last minute decision that will forever change her life and that of her unborn child.<br /><br />Catalina Sandino Moreno is a natural, and it does not hurt that she is also beautiful. Her portrayal of Maria is sensitive, yet, strong and compelling. She is, indeed, full of grace. She is also the linchpin around whom the entire film revolves, and she certainly is up to the job. The screenplay is tautly written with just the right amount of tension. Moreover, Joshua Marston's deft direction, as well as the stellar performances by the entire cast, adds up to a superlative film that should not be missed.</p></body></html>

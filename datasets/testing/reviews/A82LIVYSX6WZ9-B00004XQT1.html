<meta name="summary" content="Bale's pyscho performance saves this one"></head><body><p>starts out great and ends great. though the people around Patrick Bateman really get what they deserve. the movies sorta let down by the combination of slayings and comedy. dont mix. can Bale be any prettier and he sounds so calm and then he breaks out into the psycho he is. favorite part has got to be the chainsaw part when Bale drops it and then goes AHHHHHH!!! with blood on his face, though did he have to put his running shoes on</p></body></html>

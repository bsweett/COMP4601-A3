<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating character study of morality and authority in the Church..."></head><body><p>John Patrick Shanley has turned his prize-winning stage drama into a cinema version that is richly flavored and expands slightly on his theme of power, corruption and moral authority in a Catholic Church during the 1960s. At the heart of the tale is a progressive-minded priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is viewed as highly suspect by a tyrannical nun (Meryl Streep) who personifies all that was wrong with the strict nuns who thought that harsh discipline and humiliation was the way to rule the school classroom. The old vs. the new is what happens when these two clash.<br /><br />Very unlike what happened when Hollywood first tackled the subject of old vs. new in films like GOING MY WAY and THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S where a young priest has to cope with the unchanging steel will of a crusty old parish priest.<br /><br />Here the subject matter is much more serious too, involving the suspicions of a nun eager to seize on any reason for ridding the parish of Father Flynn whom she accuses of an immoral act with a young altar boy in his charge, based on very flimsy evidence of another naive young Sister James (Amy Adams).<br /><br />The story becomes a character study of these three as they confront the issues raised by the domineering Sister Aloysius (Streep) who insists on a private meeting with Flynn in which the accusations fly fast and furious. This scene is super-charged with emotion and dramatically effective--but even more striking fireworks are yet to come when we meet the mother of the boy (Viola Davis) who is brilliant in her two big scenes with Streep during which another twist is given to the tale.<br /><br />To tell any more would be to spoil this for anyone not familiar with the material. Clearly, Shanley has written a very powerful drama and staged it with simplicity and truth in a way that is cinematic without losing any of its dramatic force as a play.<br /><br />For the performances alone, highly recommended as a thinking man's morality play that never quite gives you the feeling that you know all the answers to the riddle presented. It's open to many interpretations, but there's no doubt about one thing--this is a stark, emotional drama and Shanley makes the transfer to screen full of cinematic magic.</p></body></html>

X2 is certainly one of the best comic adaptations ever put to film, due to the seriousness the actors and director obviously put into it. If they played it tongue-in-cheek, it would have been a disastor. All the roles are intelligently realized here, only a couple of beefs, though. The relationship between Rogue and Wolverine, so touching in the first film, is much more distant here. And what happened to Storm and Rogue's accents here? Storm being from Africa, and Rogue from Louisiana, each had noticeable accents in the first film, yet neither had them here. Oh well. Brian Cox as the bad guy was very good. One thing, I do wish his link to Wolverine was explained a bit better. Overall, the film moves well, grags little, and has action sequences that are well-done, with great effects. The ending leaves me more than ready for X3. I can't wait! Anyway, enjoy this film, because most comic-book movies aren't this well-done (remember the later Batman movies?).</p></body></html>

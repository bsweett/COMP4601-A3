<meta name="summary" content="Don't pass this over--it's pure fun!"></head><body><p>What a fun movie!  <p>This pretends to be nothing more than what it is, a summer escapist film.  Fighting, humor, innuendo, gadgets, and plenty of cleavage--it has it all!  <p>Cameron Diaz is a joy as the childlike Natalie, while Lucy Liu's Alex is all knuckles and know-how.  Drew Barrymore is Drew through and through--sexy, streetwise, and sweet.  Bill Murray is wasted, however, as Bosley; his character is all fatherly advice, costume changes, and pratfalls.  <p>With high-kicking Hong Kong style action and great visuals, if you are looking for a fun flick to pass a Saturday night, don't pass over this one.  It's a best bet.</p></body></html>

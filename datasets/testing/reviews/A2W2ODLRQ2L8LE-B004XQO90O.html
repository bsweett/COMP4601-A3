<meta name="summary" content="D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu on Ground Hog Day"></head><body><p>This movie puts a new spin on the possibility of changing realities. It is a wild mix of the movies: D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu and Ground Hog Day. And yes there is the element of a terrorist bomb and yes there is an iterative segment of time involved, in this case it is only 8 minutes.<br /><br />The storyline centers around Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal)- an American Army helicopter pilot whose last memory is flying in Afghanistan. He then wakes up on a commuter train, but he looks like someone else.<br /><br />The movie starts off like an adventure computer game, where you are thrown into a scenario where you are not sure where you are and what is really happening. As the movie progresses, you begin to realize that Colter is also in the same position, being totally unaware of his full situation.<br /><br />The movie is very interesting and like the case with Ground Hog Day, in each iteration of the eight minutes, Colter gets more and more done. The story is quite gripping and unfolds on two levels:<br /><br />- [1] the Train bomb situation<br />- [2] the real situation of Colter Stevens<br /><br />The latter is quite moving emotionally and draws you into a deep longing that Colter has to make peace with his father and to hear his voice just one last time.<br /><br />So, although it may not be quite original in its design, there is a lot of emotional content to absorb the viewer in. In my opinion, it is a good movie and well portrayed. The end had a nice twist to it. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

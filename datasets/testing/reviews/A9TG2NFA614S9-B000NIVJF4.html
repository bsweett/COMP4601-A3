<meta name="summary" content="Idi Amin in All His Nastiness and Charm"></head><body><p>The Scottish doctor in this film chooses to hero-worship the wrong man--Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator played brilliantly and flamboyantly by Forest Whitaker in an Oscar-winning performance. (Of course Whitaker looks like the monster.)  Amin charms and massages the ego of the star-struck physician who is insecure and incredibly na?ve. Graduating from Amin's personal doctor to his trusted advisor, he crosses the line and finds himself entrapped by his libido and his gullibility.<br /> The movie has an air of authenticity that makes you think you are actually in Uganda. It looks and feels very real and believable and gives a picture of Africa that rings true.<br /> Whitaker is extremely credible as the spellbinding leader who is also incredibly nasty to his own people. When the doctor tries to escape from Amin's clutches, he discovers firsthand the brutality of the tyrant. It's a brilliant film which uses the doctor's experience as the crucible to bring Amin's malignant dictatorship home to the viewer.</p></body></html>

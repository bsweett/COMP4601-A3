But men, being men, resented the arbitrary whims of the gods and it was inevitable they'd fight back.  Hades, the god of the underworld, hit upon a plan to bring fear into the hearts of men so they'd worship again.  He'd release the Kraken, a giant sea monster, and destroy a city, but at the same time gain enough power to overpower Zeus, the king of the gods.  It turned out, though, that a forgotten and resentful son of Zeus happened to be hanging around and had a motive and enough pluck to fight back.  (If you've seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HARV3Y">Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief</a>, or if you've read the book you'll notice that it's nearly the same story, with slight variations, but the movie this is based on came first, and the Greek myths both movie and the book are loosely based on came long before that).<br /><br />While sacrificing story to CGI, this update of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZD3V10">Clash of the Titans</a> manages to be entertaining enough for a popcorn family night, but not enough to come anywhere near the inventiveness and excitement of the original. Sure the original had its kitchy moments - with celebrities playing the preening gods - but it felt fresh.  I remember begging to see it as a kid when it first came out and wanting to go back right away - I even had the board game based on the movie.  This one, by contrast, feels highly derivative and only adds to the original an intensity that detracts from the characters and computer generated effects that are only partially convincing.  In the original the effects weren't convincing either, but they were clever and inventive and it felt like an illusion, it gave the feeling of a story being told, rather than a dream pretending to be real.<br /><br />The opening sequence, that tells the story of the gods against the backdrop of the constellations, was my favorite part of the film.  After that, the portrayal of the gods by Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, who both brought the required gravitas to the mix; Jason Flemyng as Calibos and Mads Michelson as Draco were also top notch, and managed to import feeling and plausibility into some implausible and over the top hokey dialogue.  Sam Worthington, unfortunately, didn't convince me as Perseus, especially given a performance that was even more wooden and less nuanced than his performance in Avatar, where at least it seemed to fit the situation.<br /><br />The action is far too busy, for the most part; too much was going on during a fight scene to have much more than a sense of chaos mixed with awe and tension, when what is needed and was sorely lacking here is a stronger sense of identification with who is being attacked by whom and what is at stake in every moment of the battle scenes.  Still, on the whole, I have to say that while I wasn't overwhelmed and on the edge of my seat I was enjoying it.  My wife and kids, who watched it with me, seemed to have fun as well, and afterwards gave it a tentative thumbs up: "yeah, that was okay, Dad."  If you don't go into it expecting much, you won't be disappointed and may even enjoy it.  If you do, check out the original, which is much more fun.</p></body></html>

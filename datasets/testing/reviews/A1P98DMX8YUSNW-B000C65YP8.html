<meta name="summary" content="A secret comedy"></head><body><p>Like many of Nick Cage's recent movies, this one has a smirkiness about it that runs all through it. Maybe it's the flat-affect voice-overs that play all through the film. But this seems more like a comedy than a thriller, even though it's about private gun-runners and is loosely based in reality. Many of the scenes are almost slapstick, even when people are getting blown away by his products. If you think this is straight, then the joke's on you.</p></body></html>

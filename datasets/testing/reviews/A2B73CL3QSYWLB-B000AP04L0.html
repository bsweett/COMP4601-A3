I don't work at one of those industrial park tech firms as portrayed here but I may as well.  I have suffered more than my share of Hawaiian shirt Fridays and mandatory birthday parties than I care to count.  This film is catharsis, even wish fullfilment, for anybody stuck in a dead-end job counting away the brain cells that are eroding from their person.  Director-writer Mike Judge gets so many details right here from the insipid "Cathy" cartoons hanging in the cubicles to the malfunctioning office equipment that seems to have a personal vendetta against you.  Ron Livingston is spot on as Peter the Everyman who just wants to take this job and shove it.  Jennifer Aniston gave me a newfound respect for waitresses at strip mall eateries.  Gary Cole is spot on as the most insufferable boss you ever had.  Stephen Root gives an inspired account of the office sociopath that everyone tends to ignore.  I remember when this film first came out it barely had a run.  Fortunately for us through home video this film has a growing following.</p></body></html>

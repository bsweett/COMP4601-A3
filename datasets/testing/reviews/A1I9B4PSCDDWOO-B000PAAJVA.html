<meta name="summary" content="Historical fantasy......."></head><body><p>Patriot proves to be a highly entertaining film but its not history, real or pretend. It sheer fantasy per Hollywood, especially when you got 20th century military warfare values inserted into 18th Century. Its sad that British soldiers are treated like Nazis in this movie and there seem to be no sense of time or period to this movie. Its make it up as you go on. I found it quite entertaining listening to the director talk on my DVD as he mentioned so often how "historically accurate" he tried to be in all aspects. In this case, he probably got some of the names right and at least knew that the British infantry wore red and American infantry mostly wore blue. Who ever were the historical consultants on this movie must either come from Iran or were bribed to put their stamp of approval on it.<p>On the other hand, Mel Gibson movies are rarely boring and he was pretty good in this movie. He sure sugarcoated everything about the slavery issue but overall, there were enough blood, guts, humor and action to satisfied most viewers. I got the Superbit DVD version which was also excellent in all aspect but don't have the extra of the regular DVD which I also end up owning. As long as you don't learned your history form watching this movie, its strictly cartoon movie for fun and joy. Of course, some scenes were bit graphic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lizards, Dolphins, Squirrels, Terry Bradshaw and McConaughey as McConaughey in Failure To Launch"></head><body><p>Matthew McConaughey (Sahara, Dazed & Confused) plays Tripp, a man who is still living with his parents played by Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates. His parents hire Paula, played by Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex and The City, Family Stone) to try to get Tripp out of the house. She says when a grown man doesnt want to get out of his parents house its called Failure To Launch, hence the title. The 2 hit it off real good but soon he doesnt want to be with her anymore and usually when he wants to break up with girls he brings them to his home where they see his parents so then they run away but Paula doesnt. Meanwhile, Paula's friend played by the everso adorable and funny Zooey Deschanel (Eulogy, All The Real Girls) has a mockingbird problem and wants to kill the bird. Tripp's friend Ace, played by Justin Bartha (Gigli (more like Gagli), National Treasure) tells her he has a bee bee gun which instantly woos her in. Bradley Cooper (Wedding Crashers, Tv's Alias) plays Tripp's other friend. We've seen this before...this is called How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, Hitch, Wedding Planner, Wedding Date and so on. Plus I dont find Sarah Jessica Parker sexy and I didnt like her in this...she was better in Family Stone, the animal attack scenes were stupid except the lizard/rock climbing scene...McConaughey tripping out was funny. The supporting cast is great and so is McConaughey doing his usual stuff. Also, the most disturbing scene which should of never been in here.....Terry Bradshaw naked!! I didnt need to see that (and if I'm giving this away...good, this'll be the warning) Also starring Katheryn Winnick (Two Weeks Notice, Kiss Me Again).</p></body></html>

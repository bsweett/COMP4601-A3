<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Funniest And Inspiring Movies Ever Made."></head><body><p>"Groundhog Day" is a classic if there ever was one. Featuring a 100 % perfect performance from the one and only Bill Murray, a strong, well written plot and loads of laugh, this is a true classic.<br /><br />Murray plays the acerbic, insulting, and overall rude weatherman Phil Connors. Along with his obsessively perky producer (Andie McDowell) and his smartass cameraman (Chris Elliot), he journeys to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover Groundhog Day. When a snowstorm hots, Phil is forced to spend the night. But when he wakes up the next morning, Phil realizes he is experiencing Groundhog Day once again, and again, again, and again...until he finally gets it right.<br /><br />This heartwarming movie is filled with laughs as well as a great message. This special edition comes with a documentary, adduio commentary by director Harold Ramis, and great remastered sound and picture quality.</p></body></html>

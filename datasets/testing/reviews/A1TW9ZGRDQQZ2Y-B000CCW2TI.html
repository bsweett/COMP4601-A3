<meta name="summary" content="One of the Few Good Wes Craven Movies"></head><body><p>While I prefer John Carpenter in terms of horror directors, Wes Craven deserves credit for A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream (1st one only), and now this little gem. The two performances that the movie focuses on almost the entire time is that of Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy. Rachel McAdams is a cutie with a gorgeous smile, but she also shows a wide range of emotions here (she goes from just a regular nice girl to a kick butt action star by the closing of the film). Cillian Murphy is really perfect here. As in Batman Begins, he hits all the creepy notes dead on and is probably one of the most believable villians to come on screen in a while. Without these two in the roles that seem written just for them, the movie would likely have been less effective in more ways than one. Red Eye runs a little under 90 minutes and never lets you catch your breath once the plane is off the ground.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cillian, a star on the rise"></head><body><p>If you haven't seen Cillian Murphy in action I recommend that you rent '28 days Later' or go see 'Red Eye' immediatly.  This is one of Hollywoods rising stars and he does no better than he's done in 'Red Eye'.  Next to young rising star Rachel McAdams, he holds his own and stands his ground as the REAL star of this picture.  At the outset of the picture you meet Lisa, a young manager of the LUX hotel in Miami.  She is flying back from a funeral in Dallas when her plane is delayed forcing her to meet the charming Jackson (never Jack) Rippner.  He wines her before their flight and upon entering the plane they realize they are seated next to each other.  The trailer I though did a great job of deception because your forced to think that your about to see a romance comedy type movie and then your tossed into a thriller of all thrillers.  You see, Jackson is using Lisa to carry out his sceme of assasination and unless Lisa plays along her father is going to be murdered.  It's edge-of-your-seat the entire film, frame by frame and Cillian is the reason for the movies intesity.  He captures his charactors fierceness and forces the viewer to hate him.  I think I see the next Russell Crowe here...embodying his charactor and I'm sure will soon warrant the academys attention.</p></body></html>

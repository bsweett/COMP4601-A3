<meta name="summary" content="Well, I enjoyed it!"></head><body><p>Doom is the most recent cinematic rendering mined from the video game industry and, like all films with a horror element,  it's better viewed in the dark.  A Marine squad responds to a frenzied call for help from a research facility on Mars and comes face to face with monsters. Led by the intense, military-to-the-core Sarge (the Rock), the marines must prevent the ravening demons from accessing "the Ark" teleportation device and gaining entry to our world.<br /><br />Dusted off from the science-run-amok department, Doom is yet another cautionary sci-fi/horror tale, replete with hackneyed characters, familiar uglies in the dark and a formulaic storyline. Somehow, though, I found myself having a good time watching this one. The Rock isn't about to win an Oscar or Emmy any time soon but his alpha male screen presence is undeniable. Karl Urban does yeoman's work as the conflicted John Grimm (codenamed Reaper), adding some depth to his kickass marine character. Icy Rosamund Pike (from James Bond's Die Another Day) detachedly plays Samantha, a forensic archaeologist and Reaper's sister. But she's nice to look at.<br /><br />If you've already seen the vastly superior Aliens or even Resident Evil, then Doom will hold no surprises. Heck, even if you haven't seen the above movies, Doom still won't catch you unawares. Still, there's a tiny morality play acted out just before the film's climax that kinda came out of left field, as well as an unexpected arc of one of the leads that I didn't see coming. The much touted first person shooter segment is pretty cool and places the audience smack-dabbed into the Doom video game universe.<br /><br />The special features aren't shabby: an extended first-person shooter sequence, as well as its "making of" segment; an amusing "Game On!" piece gives the viewer strategies and tips on how to play Doom 3; "Basic Training With the Rock" shows how the cast underwent a special forces mini-boot camp; and the nostalgic "Doom Nation" details the history of the various Doom video games and their effect on gamers and fans. I wish, though, that the Rock, Karl Urban or Rosamund Pike had done a film commentary.<br /><br />Gamers and other fans familiar with Dooms 1,2 and 3 are understandably upset that the movie version strayed so far from the games' original story. But persons with no prior knowledge of the game or those screening it purely as a cinematic experience will get a kick out of this monster-go-"boo", shoot-'em-up film.</p></body></html>

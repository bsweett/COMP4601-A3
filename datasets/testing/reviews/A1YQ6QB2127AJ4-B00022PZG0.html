<meta name="summary" content="Great Rock Comedy"></head><body><p>"School of Rock" is a great comedy starring Jack Black and Oscar nominee Joan Cusack ("Working Girl" 1988, "In & Out" 1996).  This film desplicts Dewey Finn (Black) who's struggled tremendously for years to become a famous rocker.  After he is fired from his band, he poses as a substitute teacher and uses his brother's name.  There, he begins a new rock band with a twist.  The fellow members are kids in his class.  Finn and the class must keep this a secret to prevent this act from being exposed to the school board and the community.<br /><br />Though the film is cheesy in numerous scenes, its comedic form makes the film details fit well to one another.  Through the music and the laughs, this film remains unique throughout.  All the details give new comedic meaning to rock music: the quotes, the personalities, the costumes, the performances, and others.  This desplicts accurately the life of a true struggling musician while adding a one-of-a-kind entertaining theme.  All performers add their own sense of plot throughout the film, especially Jack Black in his Golden Globe nominated role for Best Actor in a Comedy Film.  This is in no doubt his career's best, which he proves he was "made for that role".<br /><br />"School of Rock" is a great comedy for viewing pleasure of a variety of audiences.  Some may not rock music the same after watching this.  Fans of this film and/ or Jack Black should also listen to his rock band Tenacious D.</p></body></html>

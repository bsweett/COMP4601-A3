There was a lot of hype and controversy surrounding the Da Vinci Code book and movie, and to be honest with you, after seeing the moving I was disappointed and just didn't get all the hype.  The movie just didn't intrigue me.<br /><br />Angels and Demons on the other hand surprised me.  I watched the movie with low expectations, thinking it was just going to be more of the same, but it wasn't.<br /><br />There was much more action and suspense, and the movie moved along quickly.  Also, the locations and photography were stunning, and as much a part of the film as the actors were.<br /><br />To sum it up, this film redeemed the first film, the characters, and the story.  An enjoyable movie!</p></body></html>

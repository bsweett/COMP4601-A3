<meta name="summary" content="One woman, and what a woman, against them all"></head><body><p>Hard to make an action film with a woman as the main character, against all the Indiana Joneses and Bruce Lees of the world. Difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character, against all the Draculas and Frankensteins who did the reverse trip. They had to bring some kind of English fabula into the picture, accent, tea and everything else, plus a touch of Cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of Siberian whitish russianism. And it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some Arabian astrology than anything from another constellation. But it does not really matter. Lara Croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent. And it works as much as we can hope, and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her English mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate. We recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely British Clive Barker, but that might have been an illusion.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne</p></body></html>

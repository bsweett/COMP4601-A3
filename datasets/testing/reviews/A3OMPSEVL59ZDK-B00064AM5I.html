Ben Stiller is not funny anymore he needs to stop releasing films every two months. Vince Vaughn is NOT FUNNY. Everyone in this film is so satisfied with themselves and they must certainly be cracking up after the director yells cut, but they forgot to make the AUDIENCE laugh along with them. I am sick of hollywood giving us the same three people in every comedy. Harold and Kumar is the best place to go for some fresh faces in comedy and a much funnier and much better over all film experience. Dodgeball is comedy for those smokin the wacky tobacky, or people who just find every little damn thing hilarious. I wish I was so easily amused.</p></body></html>

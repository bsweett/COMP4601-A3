<meta name="summary" content="A great end to the series!  ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!"></head><body><p>Rocky Balboa is the final installment in the great Rocky franchise that began thirty years ago with the original film winning the best picture Oscar. The final film goes back to the roots of the series and focuses on Rocky as a person, and as a man, and ignores the flash of Rocky IV and the silliness of Rocky V.<br /><br /> Rocky is older now, and all he has left are memories of his boxing career and memories of Adrian, who died a few years ago. Rocky spends his nights entertaining customers at his Italian restaurant (called "Adrian's") with stories of his boxing glory. On the anniversary of Adrian's death, he tours the location where they first lived, their first date and then visits the grave. A reluctant Pauley goes with Rocky but his son Robert is absent.<br /><br /> Rocky sees a computer simulated fight of himself and current champ Mason Dixon. Rocky wins the computer fight and this gives Rocky the bug to do a little fighting again, to maybe try and get in shape. Meanwhile, Mason Dixon's managers are urging him to fight an exhibition with Rocky in hopes of improving his reputation and to make tons of money.<br /><br /> Rocky Balboa has several strengths and weaknesses. First, Sylvester Stallone is excellent in the movie. He plays Rocky as a man just trying to be good, trying to be a good father, trying to please the people in his world. Out in public, he graciously signs autographs and poses for pictures even though you can tell he's been doing it for years. Paulie is good in the movie and through flashbacks we see Creed, Adrian and Mickey. The final fight is done as an HBO broadcast and the fight is really awesome. It is much more realistic than any of the fights from the previous movies. Also, the Bill Conti score is exceptional. If you are a fan of the series, this will be a great conclusion for you.<br /><br /> Now for the complaints. Some people can nitpick about how he deals with his son and another kid that he befriends, but those subplots didn't bother me. Rocky spends the first hour of the movie moping around his restaurant. Knowing how the movie ends, I would have liked to see a little more of him staying in shape, because he'd have to be in shape to fight they way he does at the end. That being said, the training they do show via a montage is set to "Gonna Fly Now" and is predicable, boring and short. The fight is realistic, but the story told via the fight is pretty bland. Again, minor complaints, but I want you to know this isn't a "perfect" movie.<br /><br /> Rocky Balboa is a good movie, not great, but to a diehard Rocky fan, it could be considered great. It wipes the sour taste of Rocky V out of our mouth and will leave you presently surprised to see that Sylvester Stallone still has it. ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!</p></body></html>

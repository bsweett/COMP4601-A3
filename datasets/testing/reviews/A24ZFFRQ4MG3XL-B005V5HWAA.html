Especially at the very very end.<br />Kevin Costner plays a serial killer, Earl Brooks, who seems to have such a normal regular life.  He's married with one daughter in college (or just dropped out).  After one last killing, he is blackmailed by a photographer who captured it all.<br />William Hurt plays his subconcious/tempter really well, and Demi Moore plays a detective on the hunt for him.  I loved the music/score throughout the movie and even though I know how it ends now, I bought it to watch over because it's so enjoyable and dark and I really love it.</p></body></html>

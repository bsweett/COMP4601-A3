<meta name="summary" content="Why Was This The Best Science Fiction Movie Ever Made?"></head><body><p>Well, there are five reasons.<br /><br />1.  The screenplay's treatment of science.  As much as I like science fiction, science fiction fans have developed a jargon which has alienated normal people.  SF folks know, for example, not only what a time warp is, they also can explain the general theory of relativity which allows for such a thing.  So you have extremely involved scientific theory which must be explained to a lay audience, in such terms that they are not put to sleep.  H.G.Wells understood that, and Robert Zemeckis does, too.  So, without patronizing the audience or cheapening the literary value, the theory is developed and then illustrated in straightforward, dramatic and accessible terms.  It helps that the scientist-hero is lovable but not quite sane.<br /><br />2.  The screenplay's treatment of extremely touchy human issues.  OK, so you go back in time and your mother falls in love with you, which is punished by the extinguishment of your own existence.  Sound like lighthearted fun?  Can you only imagine what Quentin Tarantino would have done with this material?  But here, it becomes independent fuel for the plot, made "safe" by mom and son consummating their relationship, only to find that they taste funny.  Our socio-sexual mores are protected, and the universe is restored to peace and balance.  And they did it in only two shots, too!<br /><br />3. Production values. Today, we have amazing capabilities in CGA, capture technologies, and digital special effects. Back in 1985, they had pyro, models and matte photography. But hey, feel the love here: they built a town square set, meticulously remade the 1950s, and then "aged" it for it's run-down 1985 look. You feel as though you grew up there and then lived there throughout its degeneration. The sheer brilliance of the filmmaker's dedication to these premises is not an accident. Our Auteur (Zemeckis) and our Angel (Spielberg, before becoming the total gozillionaire he is today) said we'd spare no expense in creating a lovingly detailed picture of the past and the present...<br /><br />4. Our ability to identify. This is a movie about us. Most great movies are just that. We identify with the protagonist, the archetypal wise-guy American "kid," featured in American films since before Mickey Rooney. We identify with his finding his own past - thus completing a quest we can all identify with. But finally, we identify with everyone. Even the parents, who lose and then find their relationship in the present. Even the bad guy who, while not redeemed exactly, is placed into a role commensurate with his gifts. Even the scientist, who, in a wonderful moment in all screen history, expresses the Dr. Frankensteinian triumph but in a way that makes us all share his joy: "It Works!!" This, after many, many failures and disappointments, exposing him to ridicule as a "mad scientist" at worst and a moneyed loser at best. What could be more American than that?<br /><br />5. Gestalt. Call it what you want, but consider the conceptual continuity of these three movies. 1985 remained the "present" for all the films, right? Even this one and BTTF3, made some years later, preserved 1985 as the fulcrum year.<br /><br />Quick quiz: of all the eras depicted, which one was the best: 1885, 1955, 1985 or 2015? Tough question, given that there were at least three distinct 1985s, etc.<br /><br />But look: even the "best" 1985 was, in significant ways, not as good as the movie's 2015. Our predicates, then, are that obstacles can be overcome, the past reinvented as needed, and, most importantly, "the future is what you make it."<br /><br />I like this new millenium of ours - how about you??<br /><br />I've found no clearer demonstration of a fundamentally optimistic philosophy in any movie I ever saw. Even though these 3 films intentionally avoid sentimentality (all right, you could argue that), they express a relentless optimism that enables characters and, derivately, ourselves, to take charge of our situations, invent new solutions and fulfill Doc Brown's mandate.<br /><br />You cannot leave the movie without feeling more empowered about your own life. And it does not get any better than that.</p></body></html>

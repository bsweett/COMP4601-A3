One is to hope it really does justice to the fine writing in the book, and brings that vision to life. The other is to completely ignore the book and hope that the movie simply is a great movie, loosely based on a book text.<br /><br />To review Eragon fairly, my boyfriend and I took two different points of view. I read the book first, so I would judge the movie against the book. He did NOT read the book first, so he could watch the movie without any bias.<br /><br />We both thought the movie did a VERY poor job.<br /><br />Let's look at why. Interestingly, the things he laughed at, I laughed at as well. Probably the most key issue was the development of Saphira, the dragon. In the book, Ergaon builds a meaningful relationship with her over time. He learns about her, she learns about him, they grow to care for each other. There are subtle interplays with Saphira's jealousy and love for him. Out of all of the book's substance, this is probably the best done, and the key for the story.<br /><br />To me, the "five second explosion" where Saphira morphs from a gremlin-like baby dragon into a full grown dragon was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. It killed much of the meaning of the story. Interestingly, Bob (my boyfriend) found this morph equally ridiculous. Even without having read the book, he could clearly see that this was wrong.<br /><br />So many of the movie's scenes and dialogue are stolen from other movies that it was hard to count them all. The one in particular that had us both rolling on the ground with laughter was when Luke Skywalker (oh sorry, I mean Eragon) was wistfully looking off into the sunset as the music swelled. We kept looking for that second sun of Tattoine. Could you have been more obvious there?<br /><br />There were sections of dialogue where I literally could recite the words along with the characters, even though they weren't in the book. The things they said were THAT predictable.<br /><br />With really well written books, like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, the set designers would keep copies of the book on set, referring to them page by page to ensure they had the details exactly right. JK Rowlings was called in frequently when the first Harry Potter book was made into a movie, to ensure that the costumes and environments were perfect.<br /><br />In comparison, you have to wonder if the movie makers here even read the book. The things they "got wrong" are staggering. Yes, you could say that the book was very flawed to begin with and that they were trying to "fix" it. But if that were the case, they would have improved on the book. Instead, even the important parts of the book are lost completely - and the thievery involved in the movie is almost even more blatant than what the book held.<br /><br />I'm not saying that the book was without flaws. For example, one serious issue for me was that the only real female character - the elf, Arya - was comatose for 99% of the book. In the movie, Arya is much more talkative. You could say they "changed the book here" - but to me it was like enhancing Arwen and Eowyn's part in the Lord of the Rings movies. The book had a flaw, and they fixed it. To me that's a healthy change. Of course, they somehow turned Arya from an elf into a human, but that was minor compared to other issues.<br /><br />In general, the damage the movie plot wrought was far more severe. They destroyed Eragon's relationship with Saphira. They destroyed much of the meaning of Brom's mentorship, and of Murtagh's friendship. The variety of villager issues between Eragon and various people was simplified to "everyone is scared of the Evil Empire".<br /><br />In the end, my boyfriend, who watched the movie "without prejudice" (i.e. no book knowledge) felt VERY disappointed by what it offered as a story. I, who HAD read the book first, felt equally disappointed with how it interpreted the book. Most movies at least either please the book readers or please movie viewers. For a movie to fail on BOTH counts is quite an infamous achievement.</p></body></html>

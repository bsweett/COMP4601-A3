<meta name="summary" content="A palpable, incredibly emotional experience"></head><body><p>Cast Away is just an amazing cinematic achievement.  You don't just watch this movie; you really have to devote an entire night to it; it's just that powerful and moving.  At almost two and a half hours in length, it is uncommonly long in and of itself (but it does not feel long to the enthralled viewer); figure in all of the incredible special features included in the 2-disc special edition, and you are looking at a whole night's worth of rich entertainment.  Cast Away has just about everything you could want in a movie: romance, adventure, action, heartbreak, suspense, mystery, nature at its most ugly and most beautiful, you name it; most importantly, it manages, after several cathartic moments, to leave one with a sense of hope and a strange kind of joy.  Tom Hanks takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride, and he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for making this film work as perfectly as it does.  There really isn't a lot of dialogue during the time on the island; long drawn-out moments focus on Hanks' expression, body language, and emotion.  When he finds a friend to talk to in Wilson, he makes that character really come alive and become a very real character in the film.  <p>Don't think that this is just another Robinson Crusoe remake.  Chuck Noland (Hanks) is an obsessive, deeply committed system engineer for FedEx.  Everything for him must be planned and executed according to the limits of time, and so he is truly a duck out of water when his plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and leaves him stranded all alone on a deserted island.  Time is meaningless for him here, but he has a picture of the woman he loves with him to help him go on living when it would be so easy to just give up.  He learns to survive on his own in the tropical environment, but not without much pain and battles with hopelessness.  When the situation threatens to overwhelm him, the character of Wilson comes along.  Wilson is a volleyball, but he has a face framed with Chuck's own blood and becomes the personification of the world of people he longs to return to.  After four years on the island, Wilson is a true companion whom Chuck talks to, argues with, but dearly loves as a very real friend.  The escape attempt from the island is very powerful, containing within itself more important truths and examples of the human spirit than I can name.  It is also where the first tears begin to well up in my eyes.  You might expect this type of film to end with a long-overdue rescue and return to a happy life, but in Cast Away, the real human drama is just getting started at this point.  Chuck's return home to his friends and the woman he loves is so much more than bittersweet; having seemingly lost everyone and everything he cared for four years earlier, his miraculous return becomes another tale of great loss.  This movie is a real tear-jerker; just when you think it's time to rejoice, you are met with more poignant heartbreak.  Hope never dies, though, and the writers do a tremendous job of subtly presenting that heart-warming message.<p>I love Wilson; he is such a great character that, volleyball or not, I think he should have been nominated for a best supporting actor award.  Amazingly, he really slipped into the movie by accident, yet much of this movie's power is conveyed through him.  The inclusion of a featurette on the life and death of Wilson on the second DVD is a testament to his importance to this story.  This second DVD is filled with an incredible selection of bonus features: features on the making of the film, its special effects, and a look at the beautiful and bonafide island paradise location of the filming; there is an interview of Tom Hanks by Charlie Rose, a survivalist documentary, and a movie-length commentary as well.  You can't ask more from a movie than Cast Away gives you, and you can't ask for more from a DVD than this two-disc special edition delivers.</p></body></html>

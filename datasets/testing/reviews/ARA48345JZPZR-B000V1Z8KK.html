<meta name="summary" content="Poor Marksmanship.."></head><body><p>I was all set to enjoy a good action film with a fine cast, and sure enough the film began that way.  But very quickly after the main pivot point in the plot, the film spirals off into leftist paranoia and clumsy editorializing. A feeble  attempt at relevance has the reverse effect of turning the film trite and cliched. The villains that might have been interesting, had they been presented with any depth, became cartoonish stereotypes, and the plot became increasingly ludicrous and muddled with the result that any admiration for the craft involved was completely subsumed by this simplistic and trivial sermonizing.<br /><br />Too bad, because I like Mark Wahlburg and Fuqua has shown he has good chops in the action genre and can present complex characters ala Training Day.  But if I needed another pretentious misrepresentation of facts, I need only access any number of mainstream media.  No doubt there is a vast audience that will either ignore the op-ed message in the film or will eat-it-up.  Sorry, I'm not interested in lame caricatures and simplistic conventional wisdom.  Maybe 1/2 more star  solely for the quality of the film-making despite the content.  It's not a horrible film, having some good moments before it descends into utter silliness.  No, sadly, it's a dumb film, that could have been much better, considering the talent involved.</p></body></html>

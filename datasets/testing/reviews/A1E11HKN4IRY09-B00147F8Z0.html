That said, ALIENS VS. PREDATOR REQUIEM is a vast improvement.  The atmosphere this time around is a lot more akin to the earlier movies in both series.  Dark and bloody.  The human characters are actually likable and those who meet their demise are the ones that early in the film you are saying, "I can't wait 'till that one gets impaled to a wall."  The battles are well staged with a decent amount of creative gore (this review is before I check out the unrated ed., so there may be even more carnage).  The coolest thing about this one is the Predator.  He's no wuss.  Instead of a couple of rookies, this is one blood-thirsty E.T. who we see towards the start of the flick chillin' on the Predator home-world watching the Predator/Alien hybrid taking out some of his boys.  Before you can say, "get to the choppa," the ugly M.F. heavily arms himself, kick-starts his Predator hoopdie and high tails it to earth to kill him some aliens.  And does repeatedly.  I went in to this not expecting much, but with enough action and horror to please genre and franchise fans alike, AVPR was a most pleasant surprise.</p></body></html>

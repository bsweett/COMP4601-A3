Fox) and Doc Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) adventures through time in a time machine of Doc's invention.  The first film is the best; it has more heart than the others as Marty plays Cupid in the 50s to make sure that his parents fall in love and marry the way they are meant to.  The second film relies more on zaniness as our two heroes rush breathlessly between the past and future trying to correct paradoxes of their own making.  The final film is a let-down; there is some time travel business at the beginning before the story settles down to a standard Western comedy with all of the stereotypical elements.  Strengths of the trilogy include the performances of Fox and Lloyd, lots of complex fun with the time stream, and the many inventive ways that the supporting cast is included.  A weakness is its tendency to go for the easy joke every time, even at the cost of making our hero seem somewhat dim-witted, such as Fox ordering a Pepsi Free in the 50s or ice water in an Old West saloon, hollering in panic like a cartoon character, or flying into uncontrollable rages at the suggestion that he is a coward.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="BATMAN GETS SERIOUS"></head><body><p>I believe I watched this movie six times in one week after it's release. I had always enjoyed Michael Keaton in comedic roles ( MR. MOM, and especially BEETLEJUICE ), and was curious to see what he'd do with a serious role. His low-key, brooding, portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman was excellent, and Jack Nicholson as the Joker was phenomenal, however I was even more impressed with Tim Burton's use of darkly operatic sets, and atmospheric shadows to heighten suspense. Danny Elfman's score ( with the use of only 6 minute's of Prince's songs ) added greatly to the mood of this classic.<br /><br />I love BATMAN BEGINS, and THE DARK KNIGHT ( and I wholeheartedly agree that Heath Ledger was an even better Joker than Nicholson ), but this is the BATMAN movie to beat as far as I'm concerned.</p></body></html>

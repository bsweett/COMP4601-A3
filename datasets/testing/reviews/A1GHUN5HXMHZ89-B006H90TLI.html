I recall when I was about nineteen and saw "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" I thought wow is this cool or what? I went around smoking the little cigars like Clint Eastwood did for months. If anyone told me it wasn't cool I would have wanted to tell them they didn't know what they were talking about and vote negative for them, so I expect some negative votes here from young boys that enjoy Grand Theft Auto IV as I am not nineteen anymore and I have seen over two thousand movies since. One key difference here is the Good becomes chicken, the Bad lives, and the Ugly dies instead of the Bad. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but Jarvier Bardem does not show Lee Van Cleef acting skills here any way you stretch it. Since there is to much undue hype about this movie and Bardem's part in it, to fully appreciate this movie there are a few prerequisites:<br /><br />1. You must like homicidal maniac killers with no remorse getting away at the end.<br />2. You have to like the killer doing things like asking for a person to call a coin toss to live or asking questions with no point except for him (This is considered way cool by fans very impressionable by a remorseless role with slick lines of unexplainable cold blooded killer movies)<br />3. You must like that the guy that grabs the money in the beginning (usually considered the hero or at least a likeable character you become attached to) will be killed.<br />4. You have to like innocent people being shot in the head with an airgun just like cattle at a slaughterhouse.<br />5. You have to like that the killer can't act his way out of a wet paper bag but for this movie he will recieve high praise for his dead expression and (see 1, 2, 4).<br />6. You can't expect an obvious sense of humor as in other good Coen movies like "Raising Arizona" and "Fargo". (There may be subtle humor, but almost imperceptible except to fans of the Coen's)<br /><br />If you think I can't take hardcore like this, you are mistaken. I enjoy movies like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Heat". This isn't on the same level. There is some good acting for certain, but someone having a dead expression and shooting people with an airgun doesn't make it good acting. Josh Brolin was great and I loved Tommy Lee Jones as the sheriff in this movie, and they made it all worth my time. I would love to see Jones as a sheriff like that again in a murder investigation, but where the cold blooded murdering dog gets the chair or for the mamsy pansies lethal injection. However, in this movie I did not like the killer walking away at the end. I wanted Josh or Tommy to root him down a few feet under. I guess what they were creating here was a country version of "Pulp Fiction", or "Natural Born Killers" so if you enjoyed them, you may like this one as well. In fact Woody Harrelson is even a killer that doesn't get to kill in this one. To bad, he should have killed Jarvier Bardem's character with extreme prejudice since Woody can act. If you want to see a scary killer that can act, watch Tom Noonan in "Manhunter" or Anthony Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs". That is unless I missed the point and Jarvier was playing Michael Myers from the Halloween movies. That would make the expressionless facade, indestructable ability, and walking away at the end make sense. This is not to say Jarvier isn't scary, but saying Tony Moran had great acting skills in "Halloween" or Bardem does in this movie, is kidding yourself. I am sure even Arnold Schwarzenegger will admit it wasn't real acting he did in "The Terminator" since he is so much more talented today. Let's see if Bardem can show off his acting chops in his next movie. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" and "Love Lies Bleeding". Good quality DVD, with fair replayability.</p></body></html>

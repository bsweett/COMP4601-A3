<meta name="summary" content="Your future TV movie of the week !"></head><body><p>Okay and who made it ? Waooo Ridley Scott ? tHAT'S THE GUY WHO MADE alien, NO ? Cool and who is the main actor ? Nicolas Cage ! Terrific !!!! Is he the guy who plaid in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and 8MM ...? oH yEAH bABY ! I will have a great moment...<br />THE END !<br />What the hell ! Much talent for so little flick ! It's so predictable.I knew what it will happen as soon as he met his daughter.It's disappointing and Cage is wasting his time and talent.I easily understand why he chose to be involved in ADAPTATION but this time,there is absolutely no reason.There is nothing to keep in mind.It's EMPTY.The twist has been seen in better movies and the end is simply kind of "I KNEW IT" It's not because they waste their time that you also have to.Give up ! And wait that it appears in your TV guide.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Delightfully Sinful"></head><body><p>From what I can remember when I read the book, the film stayed fairly true to the book...which is very unusual.  If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />It's the story of a young girl who moves to NYC to become a journalist but finds herself working as an assistant for a top notch fashion magazine, which is way out of her style league. The girl is a go-getter so she does what she has to do to make it work and ends up becoming the right hand (wo)man to the editor and chief changing her life (for better or worse) forever.<br /><br />The movie, even though trashed by some critics as "shallow and unfulfilling", is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, "Runway", so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.<br /><br />All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the "high-class" laughs that it packs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alien meets the Northpole-fantastic"></head><body><p>The movie is about a twelve-man research team who's sitting fairly isolated in a polar-station. The research team gradually finds that another research team from Norway has discovered something in the ice - something that killed everyone in the Norwegian expedition. Little by little the American researchers finds themselves in the precarious situation that they must try fight an alien, which possesses the ability to take over different life forms, and of course even the human. The problem becomes in this situation that it doesn?t exist a way to find out who's infected by the creature or not which leads to an extremely paranoia in the camp.</p></body></html>

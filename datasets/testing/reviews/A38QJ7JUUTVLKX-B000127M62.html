<meta name="summary" content="This isn't suppose to be scary David J Heinrich!"></head><body><p>David J Heinrich simply doesn't get it. This movie is not suppose to be scary or suspenseful, it's an action flick. We all know Freddy had one good (scary) movie and that was the first Nightmare on Elm Street. Jason had 4, but the 1st one was scary, that was before they tired out the formula. They aren't going for scary this time., They are just out to make a fun movie for fans to see. We all know Freddy had the scarier movie, but Jason is stronger so he'll definately win, because he doesn't quit, unlike Freddy. Jason is gonna win. The next match Jason vs. Michael Myers, followed by Jason vs. Leatherface, followed by Jason vs. The Creeper. GO JASON GO!</p></body></html>

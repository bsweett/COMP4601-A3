<meta name="summary" content="Why not Two great The Things?"></head><body><p>I love the old James Arness The Thing, so I was skeptical when John Carpenter brought out a new version.<p>I was delighted, however, when I saw that he wisely crafted a story much closer to the original story, John Campbell's classic &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; that was the basis for both films.<p>Both films stand on their own and are completely different.  I think the older film has the edge on suspense and class, but the Carpenter version has much to like as well.<p>While familiar now, the special effects here were new at the time and state-of-the-art.  They are still shocking.  Overdone?  Yeah, probably (I'm especially no fan of the excess goo used at the time) but still effective.  The sets are terrific (especially the ruined Norwegian compound, the spaceship etc.). A nice isolated, claustrophobic feel to it all.<p>The DVD commentary with Carpenter and Kurt Russell is a hoot.  You can tell they had a ball making this.  Kurt Russell also loves what I think is one of the best and funniest lines ever delivered in a movie when David Clennon sees the head sprout legs and scurry off.  It's worth it to see the film just for that moment.<p>Good scares and intriguing plot, well crafted and acted.  What more do you want?</p></body></html>

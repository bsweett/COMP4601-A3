<meta name="summary" content="Adventuresome and comedic entertainment"></head><body><p>After the Maitlands (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) are prematurely killed in an automobile accident, they are returned to their home as ghosts. Meanwhile, the old country house is sold to trendy New Yorkers that entertain unwelcome changes to its charm.<br /><br />The Maitlands want them out, but have difficulty scaring the New Yorkers. So, their 'afterlife' case worker suggests hiring a bio-exorcist, Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton), to do the job.<br /><br />The New Yorker's daughter (played by Winona Ryder) serves as mediator and plays a strong supporting role.<br /><br />These words best describe the direction of Tim Burton:<br />"Know what they say about people that commit suicide? In the after life, they become civil servants."<br /><br />This flick is entertaining and worth the price.</p></body></html>

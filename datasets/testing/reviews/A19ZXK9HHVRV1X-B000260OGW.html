<meta name="summary" content="enervating western"></head><body><p>**1/2 Call me a contrarian, if you like, but, for some strange reason, I have always found myself more favorably disposed towards Kevin Costner's "failures" as a director (i.e. "Waterworld" and "The Postman") than towards his respectable, highly acclaimed "successes" ("Dances With Wolves" and his new film "Open Range").  Those former films may have been bloated, overlong and over-budgeted vanity productions, it's true, but at least with each of them, the director was willing to take a number of chances.  His westerns have been bloated and overlong, too, but they've lacked the kind of risk-taking spirit that allows us to forgive some of the filmmaker's trademark excesses and indulgences.<p>"Open Range," for all its high-minded seriousness, is a pretty tedious affair - undramatic, longwinded and plodding.  The screenplay by Craig Storper, based on the novel by Lauran Paine, is the oldie about the "freegrazers" who come into conflict with the settled ranchers who don't like the fact that these rootless steer drivers are trespassing on "their" land.  It's 1882 and, apparently, most of the once-unclaimed Far West territory has been parceled out to the highest bidder leaving little open range for the free-spirited cattlemen.  Costner and three of his freegrazing buddies find themselves in a deadly feud with the leaders of a nearby prairie town.<p>It's a stale story that culminates in a thunderous, but surprisingly unconvincing Main Street shootout (unconvincing not because the violence is unrealistic or poorly staged - it's quite well done in fact - but because some of the characters behave in ways that defy any credibility whatsoever).  Something decent might have been made out of this material had Storper and Costner not turned it into a soporific snorer with endless dialogue, minimal action and a crushing air of reverential self-importance.  Robert Duvall gives a finely etched performance as the grizzled old cowpoke who appears all tough and gruff on the surface but who is just a big old softie underneath all the leathery skin and bristly whiskers.  Even though the character itself is little more than a hoary clich&eacute;, Duvall makes the most of his opportunities.  Costner does well within his more limited acting range, but his character is even less well developed than Duvall's.  Annette Bening is stoic and valiant as the requisite love interest for Costner, but poor Diego Luna ("Y Tu Mama Tambien," "Frida") is wasted in a nothing role as the young sidekick who ends up spending most of the movie either unconscious or laid up in bed recovering from a gunshot wound suffered early on.<p>As a director, Costner generates a fairly impressive feel for the immensity of the plains and for the part weather plays in the lives of those who live there, but these alone are not enough to sustain our interest over the duration of a two hour and eighteen minute movie.  Even the attempts at humor ring hollow and untrue. <p>"Open Range" may be more of a "success" with critics and audiences than were "Waterworld" and "The Postman," but that, given Costner's rather strange track record, may be less of a good thing than it would appear at first sight.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="YOU CANNOT STOP THE BEAT!!!!!!"></head><body><p>The 2007 film based on the 2002 Broadway musical comedy and inspired by the 1988 film directed by John Waters is a triumph. Nikki Blonsky(in her first movie role) reprises the role of Tracy Turnblad(made famous by Ricki Lake and immortalized by Marissa Jaret Winikour)in the new version of Hairspray. Tracy(Blonsky)has one desire, to appear on the Corny Collins Show and win the heart of teen star Link Larkin(Zac Efron, Charlie St. Cloud), however, Velma van Tussle(Michelle Pfieffer, Stardust) is making sure Tracy's dream never come to past. But with the help of her Mom(John Travolta, Face/Off), Dad(Christopher Walken, The Dead Zone), her best friend Penny(Amanda Bynes, What I Like About You), and the show's sassy co-host Motormouth Maybelle(Queen Latifah, Last Holiday),Tracy will come out on top. This 2-disc DVD set is filled to the brim with special features, including a Hairspray timeline, a step-by-step on how to dance like the Corny Collins dancers, and deleted scenes like Tracy singing a heartfelt ballad. This film will make you feel you are actually in Baltimore in 1962 and dancing to the beat. Hairspray is the feel-good film that will leave a song in your heart forever. :)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deserves more than five stars"></head><body><p>I bought this film last night, and in the face of my own grief, I do remember the situation in Rwanda ten years ago, and how the great nations basically turned their backs to it; You have this man beautifully played by Don Cheadle(who truly deserved the nomination he got for it), who is the general manager of this five star Belgian hotel; As the situation gets worse, he tries hard to hold on to the belief that nothing could happen, but when he comes home from work, and meets his wife and a group of neighbors hiding out in his home terrified at the news of the assasination of the President, and he realizes that perhaps something is horribly wrong; His wife was beautifully portrayed as well; Nick Nolte plays a human UN peacekeeper, who tries to keep the peace in an increasingly violent country with a handful of soldiers(who were only there for "peacekeeping" not warrior status go figure; If you get this film, and don't be inspired, and or feel some shame for our part in this, something's wrong.</p></body></html>

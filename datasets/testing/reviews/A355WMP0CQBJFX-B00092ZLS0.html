<meta name="summary" content="JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED!!"></head><body><p>the best things about this movie is robert de niro, and dakota fanning. de niro, excellent actor, great in all kinds of films, especially mafia films. love him in those. in hide in seek he did what he does, and that was not a disappointment. as for dakota fanning this little girl sure knows how to act better than some adults do. the girls got talent, and she brings it out in all she does. she can be cute, adorable, and smart, but she can also be dark, scary, and weak. beautiful work. the movie overall was good, but it was pretty predictable. but there were some tid bits that you didn't expect, and the ending was pretty good.</p></body></html>

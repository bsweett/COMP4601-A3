<meta name="summary" content="Hacker 'Shrugged'"></head><body><p>If you love the 'Die Hard' franchise, you won't be disappointed by the latest installment.  I never tire of movies that are generated from plots about computers, so in the software and the hardware, the movie gets it right.  This time a terrorist is targeting hackers around the country, planting viruses in computers that detonate.  His motives are revealed later in the movie, but his maneuvering at his underground headquarters spread to sabotaging communications, energy, and traffic.  One of the most innovative scenes is when chief terrorist, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) accompanied by cat-like siren sidekick (Maggie Q),creates chaos in an underground tunnel with traffic sorting out with the lights out.  (Often the whole affair comes off like a high-tech update of children's story `Gus the Firefly'.)<br /><br />Enter John McClane (Willis) who makes harrowing a weasel word for his escape with targeted hacker, (Justin Long) a startled petty criminal who becomes McClane's sidekick to restore order to the Y2K-like deliberations.  On the sidelines is McClane's daughter who is predictable bait and McClane's best motivation in a way reminiscent of 'Armageddon' (another Willis' movie).<br /><br />The mayhem keeps the adrenaline rushing, and, although Willis's smirks and funny lines are fewer and farther between, 'Live Free or Die Hard' shows there's still some new memory in the series' hard drive.</p></body></html>

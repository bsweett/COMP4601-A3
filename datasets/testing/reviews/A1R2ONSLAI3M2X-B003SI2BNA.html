After a couple of weeks of always being rented out at my local video store, I finally got my hands on it. The whole movie centers around a woman ( played by Jennifer Connelly ) and her daughter who move to a old, run down apartment because that is all they can afford. Dahlia's soon to be ex-husband is not happy with this idea for it will interfere with his visitations with his daughter. After moving into the building, the roof in the bedroom starts constantly dripping dark water, when faucets are turned on, out comes dark water. At times, this movie can get boring. However, there are some tense, suspenseful moments in the film. We all know that Dahlia's daughter is seeing the ghost of a little girl who once lived and died there. The ending of the film was the best part with us seeing the sacrafice a mother will make for her child. It was quite sad at the end. Overall, not a bad movie to watch. The acting was good and it's worth the money to rent it.</p></body></html>

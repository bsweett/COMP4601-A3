<meta name="summary" content="Original story, still stands up today"></head><body><p>I saw this film in theaters years ago, and just viewed it on BD. The story includes all of the elements that make an interesting sci-fi flick, and it includes a dash of romance. The storyline of the "passageway" between dimensions is not unique, but since the film was released several years ago, I would need to say that it still stands up today in terms of relevance.<br /><br />It manages to be a sci-fi film, while still focusing on the core concept, which is not really laden with special effects, but rather pulls the watcher in with a mind bending concept. Though many scientific explanations of bending time and space are absent, the story still unfolds in an engaging manner. The film did seem a bit long and drawn out in parts, and in comparison with more recent sci-fi flicks, which seem to rely on non-stop action, as opposed to complex storylines, some may find this one a bit "drawn out". However, if you are more interested in an interesting film, this one may be for you.<br /><br />PQ 3.5/5, sound 4/5. Lionsgate is not known for its transfers, but given the age of the film, detail, color and blacks were still rich. For the sake of providing detail, a 50" Panasonic Plasma and PS3 80 GB was used to view the film, at a 15 ft distance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An essential part of the Spielberg canon."></head><body><p>It's easy to see "Catch Me if You Can" as Spielberg Lite. Certainly it's ridiculous to compare it with such grave, portentous films as "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan," and it doesn't call for a fraction of the technical wizardry of "E.T." or the Indiana Jones flicks. Nevertheless, in its sprightly elegance and moments of unexpected poignancy, "Catch Me if You Can" is as fine a movie as Spielberg has ever made. The themes of home and belonging are crucial to Spielberg--"E.T. phone home" could be the epigraph to his entire career. Beneath the cat-and-mouse game played by teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an intense longing on the part of both men for human connection, which they find unexpectedly in each other. Setting the action on successive Christmases was a master stroke, casting in bas relief the essential loneliness of both men. "Catch Me if You Can" would make a great double bill with Spielberg's first feature, "The Sugarland Express," another film about an epic police chase and the need for home.  Of course you probably won't think about any of this while watching the movie; you'll be too busy laughing at DiCaprio's chutzpah and Machiavellian cleverness, and at Hanks' grumpy, Sad Sack attempts to trap him. The two leads, of course, are wonderful--DiCaprio in particular plays his role the way Yo-Yo Ma plays his cello--but the standout is Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr., shedding his usual creepy persona in a moving portrayal of a man whose essential optimism is slowly ground into the dirt. Frankly, the film could stand to lose about 15 minutes at the end, but it's built up so much good will up to that point that most audiences won't mind. My guess is that, in retrospectives 50 years from now, "Catch Me if You Can" will be considered among Spielberg's finest.</p></body></html>

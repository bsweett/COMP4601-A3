<meta name="summary" content="A deeply moving epic of love and the desire to remain in loves good graces..."></head><body><p>A movie that grew on me while I slept `The Fountain' may actually be one of the best films of this past year.  It's smart, entertaining, thought provoking and elegantly paced with enough frustration, grief and sympathy to grab hold of the audience and their emotions and exploit them to the full.  If you are willing to give yourself over to `The Fountain' then you will find one of the more fulfilling movie going experiences in years, but your enjoyment will hinge fully on your willing participation.  If you easily off put by the strange side of science fiction and don't like movies that refuse to answer themselves then this may not be the movie for you, but if you readily become absorbed in cinema and relish in films that leave themselves ambiguous and up to personal interpretation, demanding the viewer think and rethink the plot hours after the credits have rolled searching for some kind of solace then this is definitely a film for you.<br /><br />At heart `The Fountain' is a story about love and the lengths one will go to maintain and preserve that deep rooted feeling of love.  While `The Fountain' may consist of three interlocking stories the main solitary focus is that of prolonged love.  Tomas, played brilliantly by Hugh Jackman, is a neurosurgeon whose wife Izzi, played effortlessly by Rachel Weisz, is dying of a tumorous disease.  Izzi is free spirited and strong in her position and tries her hardest to shield her husband from her worsening condition to spare him any added grief, but Tomas still struggles to find a cure for her condition even if it means pushing all other away from him.  This is the foundation for `The Fountain' and while our two main characters alternate between present time, 16th Century Spain and years into the future it all keeps coming back to the present life changing events that prove a catalyst for everything before and after.<br /><br />The film is deep and moving and its mood and atmosphere are added to by the impressive cast.  Jackman gives the performance of his career here, delving into three sets of emotions and unlocking three characters with enough subtlety that it appears like a natural progression.  Weisz may have won the Oscar for her previous years work but here is where she proved to me she was worth that little golden man.  Her performance is so natural and effortlessly breezy that you can't help but be drawn into those deep pools she calls eyes.  The bathtub scene is especially effective for both these actors' cases and brought tears to both my wife and I.  The supporting cast is strong despite their lack of screen time, the legendary Ellen Burstyn standing out among the crowd, but its director Darren Aronofsky who truly commands and conquers here.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Aronofsky since his brilliant work in `Requiem for a Dream' and was equally impressed by his vision in `The Fountain'.  He's a uniquely driven director who truly puts his heart and soul into his work, giving it a special touch of devotion that helps settle the experience upon the audience.  He's invested in his work and you can tell he believes in it.  Aronofsky directs his cast with such dedication and fervor and it shows and it pays off delivering a one of a kind experience.  So, this may not be a film for everyone, but if this film is for you then it will move you, embrace you and attach itself to you for the long haul.</p></body></html>

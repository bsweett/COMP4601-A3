<meta name="summary" content="Four Stars for Movie..but extra Star for Daniel Day-Lewis!"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good historical film on gang wars during the middle and late 1800's. It may not be totally historically accurate, but the feel and look of this time period is dead on. Leonardo and Cameron are okay, but nobody can compare to the brute force and flat out great acting ability of Daniel Day-Lewis. His portrayal of the ruthless Bill the Butcher should have won him the Oscar last year, not that human twig Adrien Brody who only had about twelve lines of dialogue in "The Pianist." DDL has always been good at totally changing his look and accent to fully become the character, much like Johnny Depp. DDL was in retirement from acting for over five years before he decided to do this film. If this indeed is his last on screen performance, he will be remembered for it forever. Not only because it was his personal best, but because it is one of the best overall performances in the history of cinema.</p></body></html>

I like movies that can take me for a ride but I also like movies that can take me for ride not knowing where the movie is taking me and leaving me in the suspense and the anticipation of surprise. &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; succeeds quite effectively where other horror movies fail miserably. First thing; we have two unknown actors who play brother and sister, you're given a little bit of back-story, you start the movie with some character development and it's kinda slow. This is the first rule in making a great movie! Not just horror movies but all movies! IMPLEMENT SOME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! Make us care about the experience these characters are going through. Victor Salva does a great job making these points clear in the film and to the audience. Second thing; the audience must have moments where they need to squint their eyes when being drawn into a scene that doesn't give everything away immediately. Great examples of this can be found in classic horror films like John Carpenters, &quot;The Thing,&quot; and of course &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street.&quot; Part of the successful fear factor those movies presented were the outstanding way the director presented things, &quot;darkly.&quot; Third thing; give us an ending that isn't Hollywood fluff, where the heroes triumph and the villain is cast away failing his/her mission! This is one of the biggest mistakes in horror movies because it dilutes everything the story was made from, &quot;sheer terror!&quot; The terror must keep going even as the credits are rolling and the people are leaving the theatre. I think the &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; was successful because you knew before even starting the movie the three filmmakers were reported missing. In John Carpenters &quot;The Thing,&quot; you have an ending that is quite simply the creepiest ending I've ever seen. Aside from horror, "Titanic," called to the masses because everyone knew it was a doomed voyage, even though, "Titanic," isn't a horror movie, people are magnetically drawn to doom-possibly because everyone one of us knows our days are numbered:(  The similarity from those movies and, &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; is that in all of this, you're seeing a story of doom on the horizon and it's inevitable. That's what makes a great horror movie! It must have doom and the doom must be inevitable from the get-go. So there you have it! &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; is most certainly not the greatest horror movie of it's genre but it definitely reinvigorates conventional Hollywood horror flicks by following the essential rules above.

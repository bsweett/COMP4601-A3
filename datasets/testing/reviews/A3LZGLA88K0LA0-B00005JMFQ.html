Richard Curtis has crafted a movie that is wonderfully entertaining, peopled it with an outstanding list of well known and not so well known actors, set it at Christmastime, and I had a smile on my face almost the entire movie.  This is brilliant film-making.  I even enjoyed the deleted scenes!!!<br />BILL NIGHY & GREGOR FISHER - Bill is outstanding as the has-been rock star who wants his new unabashedly awful Christmas song to be the # 1 song for the holidays.  He is rude, crude, potty mouthed, obnoxious, but ultimately loveable.  His relationship with his manager Joe (Fisher) culminates in a wonderfully tender scene where Billy admits his love.<br />COLIN FIRTH & LUCIA MONIZ as Jamie and his Portuguese housekeeper are a delightful pair, whose descent into love is touching, poignant and humorous.  The scene where Firth proposes and the whole town joins in is cinematic hoodoo, but what fun it is!<br />LIAM NEESON & THOMAS SANGSTER - this is Liam's finest work since SCHINDLER'S LIST.  His recently widowed stepdad to Sangster's brilliantly precocious Sam is a highlight of the movie.  Tender, warm, and extremely funny at times.  Sangster's love for his schoolmate Joanna is so representative of young puppy love.<br />EMMA THOMPSON & ALAN RICKMAN - Thompson is superb; her scene alone in the bedroom without one word of dialogue reflects the kind of actress this lady is.  Rickman is good too as the husband tempted by his lucscious secretary (played very well by Heike Makatsch).<br />LAURA LINNEY & RODRIGO SANTORO have the less uplifting relationship.  She is a hard working woman who feels responsible for her mentally ill brother, who is institutionalized, paranoid and schizophrenic.  Rodrigo is the office nerd who is really quite a stud and when he and Linney finally get a chance to express their feelings, phone calls from her brother interfere.  Linney is a brilliant actress and she does wonders with this difficult role.<br />HUGH GRANT & MARTINE MCCUTCHEON - Hugh is at home in this movie, even improbably cast as the Prime Minister.  But Hugh is Hugh, and his dashing aplomb and carefree masculinity match the torrid undercurrent of McCutcheon's Natalie.  His putdown of President Billy Bob Thornton is marvelous.<br />MARTIN FREEMAN & JOANNA PAGE - what a hoot!  Here we have two young people who are standins for sexual scenes of some movie, and they talk about the weather, the Prime Minister and all other kinds of things while in very compromising positions.  Quite original and well played.<br />KRIS MARSHALL is Colin, a self-proclaimed stud who ventures off to America to find babes.  One would think that he would turn out luckless, especially since he chooses to go to Wisconsin.  But true to Curtis' originality, Colin scores right away with not one, but four luscious babes.  Charming.<br />KEIRA KNIGHTLEY and ANDREW LINCOLN - she's recently wed to Lincoln's best friend, and for all intents and purposes, it looks like he resents the marriage.  We all know of course the real reason for his behavior.  Wonderfully played out by these two charming actors.<br />There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie, and the entire cast is sublime and perfect!<br />I didn't think I would like this movie at first, but it is one of my favorite movies I've seen in some time.<br />Forget the schmaltz, just enjoy the company!!!</p></body></html>

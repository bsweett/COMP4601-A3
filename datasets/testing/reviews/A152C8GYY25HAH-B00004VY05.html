<meta name="summary" content="Sci-fi adventure is grand entertainment"></head><body><p>If you judge &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; by its plot, it does not measure up to other sci-fi classics. It&#65533;s child-like and absurd, though one could argue that this is part of what makes it so disarming and wondrous. The components that really make it stand out are the glorious sets designs, the spectacular scenes, and the acting. [The performances may not be Oscar-worthy, but they are energetic and slyly amusing.] This is a grand visual treat, and, for once, all the vast amounts of money spent on a movie are truly &#65533;up there on the screen&#65533;. I have seen &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; four or five times, and each viewing brings a new appreciation of just how much thought and effort went into this production. <p>The film starts with a standard sci-fi movie prolog. A team of German archeologists is in Egypt [not again!] uncovering some very odd things. The date is 1914, just before World War I. They have found some sort of shrine to the four elements plus a mysterious fifth element. Suddenly, their work is interrupted by large, strange aliens who announce that they are there to take the stones representing the four elements before war comes. They promise to return them before another force, which is bent on destroying all life in the universe, can do its work. <p>Suddenly the movie switches, not to present day as expected, but to 300 years into the future. The time for the battle between good and evil has arrived. We meet a succession of eccentric, delightful characters. There is Leelou [Milla Jovovich], who is the fifth element &#65533; a beautiful, powerful being who represents the life force. She alone can defeat the forces of death. Korbin Dallas [Bruce Willis] is an ex-army office turned taxi driver. He is unwillingly drawn into the fray and sticks around mainly because of his fascination with Leeloo. We have a ditzy, befuddled priest named Vito Cornelius [Ian Holm] who belongs to an order which has served the forces that protect life for centuries. His assistant is an equally strange young man called Billy [Luke Perry. Finally, we meet Ruby Rhod [Chris Tucker in a role he was born to play], a transsexual TV star who has to be seen to be believed. Together, this unlikely group bands together to fight for all life as we know it. [The human villain is Zorg, played in high camp style by the amazing Gary Oldham.]<p>Besides the movie&#65533;s already mentioned assets, the thing I love about &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; is its refusal to take itself seriously. To me, this makes it far more entertaining than the last two Star Wars films; in fact, it owes more to Daffy Duck than to Darth Vader.  It never expects us to believe the story. It merely tells a very tall tale very well.  <p>The movie was directed by Luc Bresson, who made two of my other favorites &#65533; &#65533;La Femme Nikita&#65533; and &#65533;Leon&#65533;. &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533;, however, belongs in a completely different category, though all three movies have dazzling cinematography by Thierry Arbogast and pulsating music by Eric Serra.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HYDRANGEAS ANYONE?"></head><body><p>The very best film of its kind and a must see for Hydrangea lovers. Ever wonder where "Wo Fat" from "Hawaii 5-0" fame came from. See this movie and you will have no doubts except about reality itself. This film also features tour-de-force performances by Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury and Lawrence Harvey. The kind of thriller that you'll enjoy more than once to be sure.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="worthy of 10 stars, this is one hell of a masterpiece!"></head><body><p>mr. eastwood has proven, yet again, what a master craftsman he is. from a great actor, to a great director, as well as a great jazz composer, this dude is a genius who deserves every award they can bestow on him this year! the aviator pales next to this marvelous film, truly. (sorry, mr. scorcese but you may have to wait a bit longer for that oscar on your mantelpiece). morgan freeman narrates and as usual acts up a storm, as does the magnificent hillary swank, in a film so deeply moving and unforgettable, you will wind up going to see it again, and when the dvd does come out, we will all rush to get it that day. clint, you have been, and remain a true master of the art form we call cinema.  bravo, sir!  thank you as well.........</p></body></html>

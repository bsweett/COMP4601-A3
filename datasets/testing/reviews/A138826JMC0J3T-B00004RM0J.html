<meta name="summary" content="The Goonies"></head><body><p>The Goonies to this day is still one of my avorites! This is just an awesome movie! It starts out that Mikey (a young Sean Astin) finds out that they have to move because a rich man is buying up their house and putting a golf course down in it's place. <p>While haning out with his friends Mouth (Corey Feldman), Data (Ke Huy Quan) and Chunk (Jeff Cohen), they find a map of their town and on the map it says there is buried treasure. Mikey then gets the idea that if they found the treasure, they wouldn't have to leave! In a wild and crazy adventure from hiding from the criminal family the Fratelli's, who want that treasure too, to dodging booby traps to some good old laughs, this is a great family comedy movie that will entertain the entire family.<p>Now there is some swearing and sexual humor in this movie but it's very minute compared to some of the things these days. It's almost a timeless classic that you'll never get bored of. Pick up this movie and enjoy!</p></body></html>

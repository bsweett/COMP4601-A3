<meta name="summary" content="X-Men 2(2003)"></head><body><p>X-Men 2(2003, a.k.a. X2) picks up where the first film left off. Director Bryan Singer tries to emulate The Empire Strikes Back(1980) by turning X-Men 2 into a long chase scene. The government is going to extremes to put mutants into captivity! "Peaceful Mutants" and "Radical Mutants" must band together and stay one step ahead of government troops.<br />Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) stumbles upon a laboratory where he was used in an experiment. John Ottman wrote the music score for X2. He flavors music cues with bits of classical music. This is the first X-Men film where we see Nightcrawler, a blue-skinned mutant with the power to teleport himself to other places. Singer throws in a couple references to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan(1982). X-Men 2 left a door open for a sequel: X-Men 3(2006).</p></body></html>

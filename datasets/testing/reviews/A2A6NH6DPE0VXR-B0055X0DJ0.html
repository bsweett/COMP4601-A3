<meta name="summary" content="The first was done better"></head><body><p>This movie was ok, but it didn't really make me care whether or not there's a part 3. If there is they need a more talented director like JJ Abrams. Michael Bay did a better job with the first film. This one has less of a head on it's shoulder. I think with sequels Bay will just give us the same stuff over and over again. Megan Fox in tight clothes running and screaming in slow motion "not that there's anything wrong with that lol", Decepticons after Sam and Autobots having to protect him and the humans being more developed and shown more than the Transformers.<br /><br />  The fights between the Autobots and Decepticons are just messy and the movement is so quick that it's hard to keep up with what's going on. While the Transformers are just side characters in their own franchise, everything is more about Sam and his girlfriend (Megan Fox). We are hardly introduced to any of the new Autobots. The 2 new Autobots to me were as painful as 2 Jar-Jar Binks. They were annoying. While the film could have used characters like Hot Rod or the Dinobots. But even if they were in it, I don't think we'd even be introduced to them or be made to care about them. The only Autobot that we were ever made to really care about in the films is Bumble Bee, we don't really care if any of the others get ripped apart since they are undeveloped. Hell even Optimos Prime is under-used in this movie.<br /><br />  Bay knows how to do very few things. Such as...blowing stuff up, making a loud movie and smothering us with patriotism and romance. The first movie had all that, but it was executed better and the movie was fresh. This one could have just used a lot more development. I mean people complained that Terminator: Salvation was all action and no brains but I think that applies to this film a lot more. It has nice effects, the acting wasn't bad and there was some fun but it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. It has more battles and more action, yet it gets tiresome. While Bay's idea of good humor is not 1 but 3 scenes that have to do with either dogs humping or a little transformer humping Megan Fox's leg.</p></body></html>

The idea of a superhero family permanently undercover because of lawsuits is neat, to begin with. Craig T. Nelson gives a very believable style to "Bob Parr" (Mr. Incredible), as does Holly Hunter to Elastigirl. In fact, the animators managed to give all the characters a high degree of individuality and the scriptwriters included lots and lots of sometimes abstruse references to the world of comic books. Nice homage to Edith Head, too.</p></body></html>

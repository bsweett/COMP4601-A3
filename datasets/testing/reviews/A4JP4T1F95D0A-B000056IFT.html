Based on an excellent story, this movie involves a man who starts to regain memories of being on Mars.  Soon he finds that he is so much more than just a construction worker, that his whole life was just a lie.  Tons of action and plenty of eye candy, this dvd is a nice print and a good addition to any collection.</p></body></html>

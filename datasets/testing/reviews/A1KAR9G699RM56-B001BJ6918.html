<meta name="summary" content="Still Quentin, but not as winning"></head><body><p>Kill Bill, Volume 2 carried on the two-part Quentin Tarantino homage to early Asian films decently, however it did not hold up to its predecessor.  There was less action, and the focus was more about the characters, which is usually not necessarily a bad thing, except for anticipated build-up to a climax that was never there.  In addition, I personally enjoyed the anime sequence in the first film and sadly felt that a similar animation would have made the second movie more enjoyable, but I do understand Quentin wants to give homage in different ways.  On another note, I feel that this film was more apt to grab the audience's emotions, although even this was weakly carried out.  Those of you who really enjoyed the first one will be let down, at least a bit.  However, as the homage that it was meant to be, I still say that it is overall not a bad movie.  Also, for the families, if you did not know it is definitely violent, with less displays of overt bloodshed that stood out in the first movie.</p></body></html>

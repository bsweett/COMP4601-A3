It sets up like a tragedy, showcase the protagonist's transformation, has the superhero saved a helpless damsel (although I don't see the point of that scene since Ghost Rider wouldn't waste time on it),  gets into trouble with the law, dealing with a complicated romance, fights a villain in an elaborate setting, and it ends with the protagonist riding across the land with his patented costume; there's no surprises about this movie and nothing to resonate with me.  I will say that the special effects were quite good and mostly used in effective ways, like whenever Johnny Blaze gets near a shadow, whatever his body part touches it changes.  Plus, if there's an actor among the cast I can welcome with open arms and no real criticism, it's Sam Elliott; he's playing the same character from "The Big Lewbowski", but his relaxed demeanor was refreshing in an otherwise-dopey superhero film.<br /><br />For a movie about demons walking the earth and a flaming skeleton riding a Harley, this movie is campy.  The ridiculousness of its characters pushed me away from this film; I expected much from Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze since he's always been a little nutsy, but then there's the villains.  Mephistopheles (Henry Fonda) is so blatantly evil that he' laughable; granted, he IS evil given he's The Devil, but there's nothing subtle about him, which makes Blaze's pact with him worthy of a slap to the face.  However, he's nothing compared to the real antagonist, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who...has a way...with speaking certain...lines in......dramatic pauses, he's so cartoony about his behavior that I can't possibly seem him as a threat.  It's problematic enough just about everyone in this movie has an itching for cheesy one-liners, which makes me wonder if that's all Mark Steven Johnson is really capable of as a writer?  Maybe the director really likes comic books and wants to make movies off of them, but the thing is he's not very good at it.</p></body></html>

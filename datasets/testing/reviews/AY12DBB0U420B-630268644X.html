<meta name="summary" content="First Rate! A Psychological Drama More Than An Action Film."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Reservoir Dogs" (Special 10th Anniversary Edition). I watched the full screen version. It was an interesting and stunning movie on many different levels. The movie attracted considerable critical acclaim, and it deserved it. It's a gristly and violent movie, so beware if you're squeamish. Also, most of the language leans toward the F-speak dialect, a little too much in my opinion.<br /><br />The movie concerned a major diamond robbery which was anticipated and thwarted by the police and, ultimately, turned into a disaster for all concerned. Now, doesn't this seem like a good plot for a high action movie? Well, it's not. The robbery wasn't even shown and there's very little in the way of action. Most of the movie is pure dialog which took place at a limited number of settings. What limited action took place was gory and somewhat difficult to watch.<br /><br />The movie was divided into a number of scenes and these were shown out of chronologic order so it's up to the viewer to piece the story together. It's complicated, but thought provoking. The scenes depicted the Reservoir Dogs characters, each given a color-code name, such as black, white, pink as a security matter. There were about six main characters, plus a couple minor ones. Some scenes involved planning at different stages. Some scenes involved the different characters and their lives outside of the robbery story. Some involved different aspects of the robbery as it unfolded and afterward. Most of the scenes involved the regrouping of the Dogs at an old warehouse after the robbery. The robbery was thwarted through the efforts of an undercover cop who was, in fact, one of the Reservoir Dogs and the group gradually realized that one among them was a traitor to the group effort. The movie was a very interesting study of character and the  tension built to a catastrophic climax. It was an exceptionally well done movie. The acting was absolutely first rate! If you're having problems understanding things in the early going, stay with it. It's worth the effort!<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

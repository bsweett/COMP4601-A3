<meta name="summary" content="a big fat disappointment"></head><body><p>My tag line pretty much sums it up.<br />I had heard this movie was hysterically funny, and I wasn't laughing much at all.<br />Actually not many people were laughing when I saw this story of an "ugly duckling" who comes out of her shell and comes into her own. It's a coming of age, which I can appreciate.<br />Seeing as a Greek person, the star of the film, Nia Vardalos, wrote the screenplay, the portrayals of the Greek family must be right on. Well, I felt saddened by there behavior. I thought since Toula(Nia Vardalos) was coming into her new brave world that she would have put her foot down and had her wedding her way instead of her family's way. They entirely took over everything. It just bothered me to watch her allow this cuz they are "family".<br />A big letdown of a movie.  Avoid!! It's not funny.</p></body></html>

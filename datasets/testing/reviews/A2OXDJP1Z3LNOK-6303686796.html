<meta name="summary" content="One crazy freakout hellride of a movie!"></head><body><p>This movie, after more than 20 years - still gives me the creeps.  De Niro, as the deranged taxi driver turned vigilante, makes you want to avoid taking a cab at all costs.<p>Jodie Foster plays the part of a pre-teen hooker with excellence.  Her character is sad and provides the only outlet of caring for De Niro.<p>Great bit parts are played by Albert Brooks and Cybill Shepard.<p>What really makes this movie so good is the use of odd camera angles and some very eerie saxophone music.  A great movie that triggers all of your senses.</p></body></html>

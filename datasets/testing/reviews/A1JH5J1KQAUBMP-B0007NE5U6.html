<meta name="summary" content="A step down from the middling first film"></head><body><p>As in the first film, Bridget Jones (Rene Zellweger) embarrasses herself again and again.  We're supposed to root for her because she's the underdog, but in the universe of these films she's been blessed with cuteness beyond words, a devoted boyfriend (Colin Firth) who forgives everything (despite an endless string of contrived misunderstandings), and a trio of single eunuchs (Sally Phillips, James Callis, and Shirley Henderson) whose sole reason for existence seems to be cheering and supporting Bridget.  In addition, pop songs swirl around her whenever she's feeling sad and pensive.  Given all that, I wouldn't mind trading places with Bridget.<br /><br />The gifted cast isn't up to the task of saving this one.  It generates an occassional smile but also some genuine grimaces, such as during an embarrasing (for the filmmakers as well as Bridget) sequence in which she is incarcerated in a Thai prison.  Naturally, the downtrodden Thai prostitutes are charmed by the chubby British white girl, hang on her every word, and enthusiastically participate in her impromptu performance of a Madonna song./</p></body></html>

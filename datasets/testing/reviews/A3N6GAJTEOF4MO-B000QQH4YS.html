This is one of the only films that I can sincerely say I can watch over and over again from start to finish and never get bored.<br /><br />The OCP (Omni Consumer Products) have been handed control of the local law enforcement of Detroit and their aim is to eradicate gang crime before construction begins on Delta City. A mega city that is set to bring Detroit into the present and make it a bustling metropolis. A presentation takes place at an OCP board meeting of a new crime fighting prototype, ED-209. The presentation goes horribly wrong as it executes a member of the board. Seeing this crisis, the young brash executive Bob Morton seizes his opportunity and pitches to the CEO the idea of Robocop for which the CEO accepts his proposal.<br />A newly assigned officer to the West Metro Precinct, Alex Murphy is sent out on his first assignment with his partner Anne. The pair are called to follow a van that is believed to have been involved in an armed robbery. The pair end up following the van to an old, abandoned steel mill and they discover it's the holdout for the most ruthless gang Detroit has seen. Murphy ends up alone in this steel mill with guns pointed at him and the leader of the gang, Clarence Boddicker wants him blown to pieces. They unload shots in to his chest and blow off one of his arms and ultimately leave him for dead.<br />In the hospital Murphy is pronounced dead and that gives Bob Morton his volunteer for the Robocop prototype. When Robocop is first introduced to the criminals, he makes an impact as he becomes simply unstoppable. Through flashbacks from his previous life as Murphy, Robocop goes looking for the people that killed him and tore apart his family. This leads him to untangle a web of corruption and deceit that is something that becomes quite emotional.<br /><br />This film is definitely something special and the cast for each role are perfect in every way. Peter Weller at the time was a relatively unknown actor but this is the type of career where one movie can be a man's biggest triumph. To some this would seem like a failed career, but to others Robocop being your biggest movie and becoming remembered through time as the actor who played Robocop that's something to be proud of. The real gem of a character in this film is Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. He plays the typical hard arsed individual who shows no remorse and no compassion, even for those who are part of his own gang. This is something that Kurtwood should be proud of and he gives us a character that I found to be truly menacing.<br /><br />All in all this is a spectacular film that I will always love and will always play a part in my Blu-Ray collection.</p></body></html>

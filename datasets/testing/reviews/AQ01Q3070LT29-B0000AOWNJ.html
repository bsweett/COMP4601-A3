<meta name="summary" content="Stop Color-Bleaching Films.  Quit the Green-Tinting!"></head><body><p>Many subliminal images here in this film.  Very eerie and gross.  I dislike the films that are shown in green tint also known as color-bleaching and ultra-violet.  Please Hollywood, New York and Vancouver, to all directors and producers: Film Your Movies in Brilliant Normal Color!  Easter Egg: On your DVD remote control, press your up or down button until you see the red lesser/greater ^ sign disappear.  Then press "Play".  You will see more subliminal images.  When done.  Start screen appears again.  You will hear phone ring.  This film is NOT for children to see.  Adults Only. This USA version of the film is a remake from the Japanese version "RINGU".<br />  Followed by Ring 2 (2005).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Funny!!!"></head><body><p>This is a very funny movie from the creators of South Park! I love all the jokes about the F.A.G. actors, the terrorists, the song about AIDS, the puppet sex, and much more! It's a fun movie to watch. The leader of Team America named Spottswoode hires a brilliant stage actor named Gary Johnston to help them retrieve information about WMDs. Gary and Lisa fall in love, but Sarah is mad about that. Soon, the whole team is taken by Kim Jong-il's men. Gary tries to help stop him from carrying out his evil plan. If you love comedy, puppets, and Trey Parker & Matt Stone's humor, you'll love TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE!!!</p></body></html>

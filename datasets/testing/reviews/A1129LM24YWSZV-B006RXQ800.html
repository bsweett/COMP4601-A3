Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is killed in a bloody stuggle between the immigrants and the "natives" (led by Billy Cutting, played by Daniel Day-Lewis). Years later, Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), plots revenge for his father's murder. Cutting, unknowing, takes the young Amsterdam under his wing, practically adopting him as the son he never had. Amsterdam, who has never known a father and is starving for familial affection, battles daily with his internal demons.<br /><br />This movie is long, but it is incredibly atmospheric. One gets a true sense of what life might have been like in New york in the 1850's - dirty, crowded, a real struggle for survival, the cacophany of cultures being thrown together in close quarters for the first time, the great disparity between the rich and the poor. And, most of all, how the passage of time erases all of man's great struggles, leaving only slight scars on the cityscape.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio, looking for the first time like an actual man and not some scrawny teenager, turns in a good performance. But the real star of the movie is Daniel Day-Lewis. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, "Geez, he looks like an idiot. Who did costumes for this thing?" But when I saw his performance, I was positively blown away. He is absolutely inspired in this film. As a viewer, I felt both attracted to him and repelled by him. His nuanced character is capable of such cruelty, but he is also a man of great principle, and he feels an almost boundless pride and love for Amsterdam. He also has great respect for Priest Vallon, Amsterdam's father. (He feels that they were cut from the same cloth, believing that only their differences in religion separated them.)<br /><br />All in all, this is a great film, and I definitely recommend it.</p></body></html>

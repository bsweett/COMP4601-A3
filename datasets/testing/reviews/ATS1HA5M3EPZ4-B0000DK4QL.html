Die hard Daredevil fans will most likely hate it due to it butchering of the story lines taken from the comics themselves.  Those who are not fans will most likely enjoy it for it effects, the love story and kinetic action.  I am the exception that I spoke of earlier.  Yes, the characters, story arcs and even some of his powers have been altered for unknown reasons, but if you watch it for what it is, it's pretty good.  No where near the statis of Spider Man, or Xmen (1 or 2), or I suspect even as good as the upcoming Hulk.  But Daredevil was never a wholly mainstream book and it's readers were not always faithful.  Changing writers made the books appeal dip up and down like a rollercoaster.  In turn the cutural consequences of messing with the character didn't carry the weight that it would if characteristics were changed for Spider Man or Xmen.  I liked the movie as a whole, but some aspects were foolishly changed and I cannot understand why.  It's action packed, the chemistry between Garner and Affleck is good, but not great.  Affleck actually plays the character well, and accuratly.  It's strange that with his hollywood status, and his well known liking of the character, that he let this inconsistancy happen.  But it could have been his idea, who knows.  There will most likely be a sequel, let's hope things get better.  I would actually give it three and half stars.</p></body></html>

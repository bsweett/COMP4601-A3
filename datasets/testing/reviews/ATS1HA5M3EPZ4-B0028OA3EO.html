<meta name="summary" content="A Welcome Return"></head><body><p>Being shelved, fought over, re-written and passed on by three CEOs, over 20 producers and countless writers, the wait was finally over when Brian Singer decided to take the reins on rebooting the Superman franchise.  The only person to survive the whole process was Jon `former hairstylist to Barbara Streisand-the movie must have a giant spider' Peters, whose heavy handed and outlandish approach to the character was probably one of the main reasons the movie never got made in the 90s.  Look him up, check out Kevin Smith's `An Evening With...' and you'll understand what I mean.  He represents the worst of Hollywood's worst producers who think they know what people want in doing massive re-imaging of classic characters.  He would make remake John Wayne into a Lawyer and Marilyn Monroe into `Barb Wire' if he had his way.<br /><br />But I digress.  His name is most likely on this movie simply because he has been involved from the beginning.  Thankfully Brian Singer, who proved his worth with the first two X-Men films, brings high end quality to the film and the story.<br /><br />Five years have past since the story of Superman 2 (Superman 3 & 4 thankfully have been graciously and shamelessly ignored/forgotten) and the Man of Steel returns to Earth after searching for remains of his home world.  At his return he find things have moved forward without him.  Not all in a good way either.  He finds the world has changed quite a bit, most due to 9/11 as he flips through channels and sees the news reports.  He also finds that Lois has moved on, having a child and a fianc&eacute;.  This lends to a great human element of Superman; did he ever think about how the people of Earth would move on while he was gone?  Did it occur to him that Lois wouldn't wait forever?  The humanistic aspect of this discovery lends to good dramatic elements.  Superman doesn't give up so easily on Lois and she obviously still harbors feelings for him.  Although she's deeply ticked at him for leaving without saying goodbye, so she keeps her distance.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, Lex Luthor is released from prison, ironically because of Superman not showing up for the Appeals hearing.  He immediately begins planning his next scheme.  Kevin Spacey is on the money as Lex, giving an efficient performance.  Lex is determined to be the mastermind he is and he doesn't waste time talking about out loud or gloating when he could be furthering his goals.  He is intelligent, vicious and surprisingly likable.<br /><br />To further comment on the casting, I have to say I have mixed feeling about Brandon Routh.  Generally I think he's excellent.  He plays both sides of the character as well as Christopher Reeve did.  As Clark Kent his goofy antics to cover suspicion are actually even more subtle and more endearing.  As Superman, he's a little less convincing.  He doesn't have the presence that Christopher Reeve did, but you want so much to believe he is Superman that any doubts you have are just washed away with his likeability.  His Midwestern values ooze from his persona, just like Reeve.  The few doubts I have may be there only because that was the Superman I grew up with.  Newcomers won't make those comparisons.  Even so, no one can deny that Reeve had a greater physical presence and his eyes had a piercing quality that just can't be duplicated.  I was more impressed with Kate Bosworth.  Going in, I knew nothing about her, but once I first saw her on the screen I wasn't impressed.  But as the movie went on, I realized she had the grit and venom spitting down.  She was a tough woman reporter who had been scorned, and despite her finding love again with someone else, the moment Superman shows up, she kicks up the venom spewing a notch.  By the end, you're opinions of her have changed, but she really hasn't.  She (Lois) is still a bit bitchy and not totally over the whole being scorned thing.  However, Kate is a bit young to have gone through everything they talked about AND have a kid AND be as world weary as she is.  These are all just nit picks though, I still enjoyed watching them both.  Routh and Bosworth have good chemistry, which is important considering the chemistry between Reeve and Margot Kidder was so great.<br /><br />The plot line is not too far off from the first, but still original.  There is no doubt that so many aspects of the movie are an homage to the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve films made over twenty five years ago.  Singer throws in just enough of the back story of those films to continue on here.  Composer John Ottman certainly ignores his own pride and integrates the popular John Williams theme into his own score, stitching together the past movies with this one even more.<br /><br />The action scenes are great in this one although I would have loved to have seen more super-feats (rescues, stopping criminals, etc.), there was an entire montage of those in the first movie and with so many similarities why not do that too.  There is a great shot that is a tribute to Action Comics #1 where he is putting the car on the ground.  Fans will see it.  Overall it was an incredible movie with great heart and soul being used to revive one of the worlds greatest heroes.  Welcome back Superman.</p></body></html>

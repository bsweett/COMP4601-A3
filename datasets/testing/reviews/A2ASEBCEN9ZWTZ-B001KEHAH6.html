<meta name="summary" content="Garner Goes Big"></head><body><p>Jennifer Garner returns to the big screen for this naughty and nice comedy about making the things that went wrong in life right.<p>THE STORY<p>As a young girl Jenna Rink just wanted to be popular and to grow up to be "30, flirty and thriving."  On her 13th birthday she managed to get the "popular girls" at school (and of course they were mean) to come to her birthday party and she choose them over her best friend Matt.  After making a wish with the "magical wishing dust" Matt gave her for her birthday Jenna wakes up 17 years later, "30, flirty and thriving."  As Jenna adjusts to her new world she learns that growing up to have everything she wanted isn't all it's cracked up to be as she finds that while clawing her way to the top she in fact lost everything that really matters to her in life.<p>THE COOL STUFF<p>Overall, the "life lessons" Jenna learns are some pretty darn valuable and deep stuff so kudos to the writers for writing out a deep but yet funny story.  Jennifer Garner's portrayal of a 13 year-old trapped in a 30 year-old body was just AWESOME as she had all the "little" things down pat from facials to movements.  Contrasting it with Tom Hanks' "Big" I'd say Garner wins hands down in performance.<p>BEST SCENES<p>1. The Pajama Party<p>2. "Thriller"<p>3. The photo shoot<p>4. Jenna makes things right at the end<p>THE VERDICT<p>A funny AND sophisticated comedy?  Who'd have thought?  If you're a Garner fan or a chick flick fan you KNOW you'll see this one.<p>Highest Recommendation</p></body></html>

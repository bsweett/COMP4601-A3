I recommend me so much of favorite panels from the comics. I love how the film depicted Elektra and how she was in conflict with herself. I thought their was a lot of depth in Garner's portrayal. She even surprised me. There are exceptional martial arts sequences in "Elektra", including spectacular kali and escrima stick moves. Key scenes include the first conflict at the cabin and the final showdown with the main villain. Overall, nice movie, I just wish they had went to the "R" rating and traded in some of the dopey green fog for blood.</p></body></html>

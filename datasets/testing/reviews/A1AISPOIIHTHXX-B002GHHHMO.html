<meta name="summary" content="It was a good movie. Scariest ever? Maybe."></head><body><p>Ever get sick of the "horror" movies lately? Where some guys snoops around an old house/abandoned building/graveyard etc in the dark and some guy pops out of the screen and goes "HEY!"? Well these are called jump scenes or gotcha moments where it makes the audience jump. The recent movies are just this though and that's the problem: too many scenes trying to scare you when the film itself should do so, not the combined effect of individual scenes. The Exorcist was one of those films that doesn't really have any jump moments but there was enough in it to unnerve you a bit.<br /><br />All's well in a nice house in the States except one thing: a young girl named Regan is possessed by a demon. Her odd demeanor certainly alarms her mother, an actress, as well as other housemates. Eventually Father Karras is called in as well as Priest Merrin to try and perform an exorcism to rid Regan of the demon.<br /><br />Maybe it's just my standards have gotten a bit higher, or maybe the infamous scenes and images in the film have been parodied so many times that it takes away the shock of everything. Granted the film is unnerving and of course the subject matter isn't all fluffyness but the film didn't make me go "holy crap!". In fact the only time I ever jumped was when the sound got incredibly and a bit unneccesarily loud for one moment.<br /><br />The film however shines in its acting with Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow and of course Linda Blair. Unlike Jennifer Carpenter in Emily Rose, Linda didn't supply her odd voice but someone else but it still works as well anyway. The infamous spider walk scene has been restored and it's probably one of the more well-known scenes that was not in a film.<br /><br />Disappointly are the extras which are basically 2-3 pages of text about things. No interviews? There is a commentary but not having making ofs or at least a retrospective would've helped.<br /><br />Watch this one and avoid the 2nd one but give the 3rd a try, especially to watch the nurse scene, creeeppppy.</p></body></html>

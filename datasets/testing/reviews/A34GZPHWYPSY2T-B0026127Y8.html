<meta name="summary" content="I WAS TAKEN WITH "TAKEN""></head><body><p>Since this film is approaching 3 years of age, there is no hesitation on my part to reveal spoilers--because you have to hear about all these, if you haven't seen this movie, in order to really make you want to see it. If you've seen it, maybe I can convince you how much better this film is than you already think it is!<br /><br />The best thing about this film is that it was shown on the heels of the awful, overrated "Casino Royale". This film has Liam Neeson at his level best, and I wondered after watching it why Neeson wasn't picked to be the next James Bond. He sure delivers in this film. Other than looking a bit thin and haggard, Neeson is brilliant.<br /><br />Story: it is what all film ought to be, clean, solid goal-oriented, no distractions. It's essentially a remake of Steven Segal's horrible 2003 offering "Belly of the Beast"--an ex-CIA operative finds his darling daughter has been kidnapped by a prostitution ring, while on a trip to Paris. Same as Beast, except no Segal, no silly mysticism and no Thailand. I loved that this film was pure Neeson.<br /><br />In "Taken", Neeson SHINES. This man starts out the film as a poor schlmiel, divorced from his wife, competing with his wife's powerfully wealthy new husband--a man who is stealing the daughter's attention and affection. The way Neeson is left standing around makes one ache for him. His deep love for his daughter transcends all boundaries and anyone with a daughter will resonate. Neeson has a common-man tenderness and sincerity about him that few actors have.<br /><br />It is not immediately apparent that he was ever anyone of significance: he dresses like Dustin Hoffman. He seems to slouch; no Indiana Jones bravado for him. He can't, because no one is supposed to know exactly what he did before he retired. We get a few clues at first when he gathers with pals for a barbecue. Later he tells his inquisitive daughter, rather warily, "I was gone so much because I worked for the government."<br /><br />But when he vows to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter, Neeson and this film are all business--the best kind of business. Neeson is relentless and unstoppable. He shows what CIA and Langley AFB training is really about: when he shoots, he shoots to kill and does it with one bullet. No rookie aerosol hails of bullets; one target, one bullet, as training dictates.<br /><br />The kills are immediate and thorough, so no one springs up later to try another pot-shot at him. He wastes no resources, and since his time is never wasted, the viewer's time isn't wasted. Neeson is playing American, so I'd like to add that his accent, pure and basic, never slips once.<br /><br />Neeson is believable because the film is believable. "Taken" is well acted, well written and, yes, it got a bit silly (it strove for a PG-13 rating so it occasionally approaches an almost Disney-esque air). I recall it was hyped somewhat, then dropped dead. Can't imagine why, since '08 was a rather distracted, uneven year for film releases, much like the following year was.<br /><br />This film is terrific because it is for the action fan and faint-hearted alike: Neeson does no idiotic stunts, he flows as if he's dancing, and there is little in the way of graphic garbage so common today (except for the harrowing phone call with his daughter while she's being abducted, and of course the scene in which he tortures a man for information, CIA style--that was a political statement and not a gruesome exercize...hardly graphic nonsense).<br /><br />The kills are so very realistic, I had to point it out to my wife who merely said, "God, that was fast!" It is like it happens for agents in real life, I was able to use those scenes as examples for my wife in case she ever has to defend herself (God forbid), and that is why I highly recommend this film as a shining example of the U.S. goverment agent/CIA/spy-on-a-spree genre. It is all quality, all action, and an unforeseen yet perfect Neeson vehicle.<br /><br />Even if Neeson got nothing out of it, buy it and cherish it as the best you'll ever see in retired-agent's-child-is-kidnapped. Neeson is better than Segal and Daniel Craig any day, in my book.</p></body></html>

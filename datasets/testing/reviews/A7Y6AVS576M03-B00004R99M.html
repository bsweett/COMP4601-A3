<meta name="summary" content="Mary Poppins on DVD"></head><body><p>This is probably one of Walt Disney's best films, if not the best. It is the most excellent realized combination of live action and animation. It  contains eternal charm, wit, and magic as it introduces us to the  &quot;practically perfect&quot; nanny who brings profound change to the  Banks family of London in the early twentieth century. Every song composed  by Richard and Robert Sherman is pure magic. The believable visual effects,  the heartfelt scripting, and the solid performances by Julie Andrews and  the heart rendering Dick Van Dyke are truly eternal. Every element of  production came together at their zenith to create a treasure of cinematic  endearment. The DVD is excellent. The supplemental material is very good  and nostalgic. One of the best films ever made. The superb cast also  includes: David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher,  Ed Wynn, Hermione Baddeley, Reginald Owen and Jane Darwell as The Bird  Woman. Director, Robert Stevenson is at his best.</p></body></html>

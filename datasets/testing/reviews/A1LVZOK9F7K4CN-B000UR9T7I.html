<meta name="summary" content="They should have kept Michael Chabon..."></head><body><p>I saw this movie at an advanced screening and, although it is not a bad film, it doesn't live up to the standard set by Spider-Man 2.  They did it right in Spider-Man 2 by hiring Michael Chabon to co-write the script.  Based on the evidence of the other two films, he brought a much-need sensibility to the project.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Spider-Man 3 is over-stuffed.  This is the same mistake that plagued the Batman sequels, as well as X-Men 3.  It tries to tell the Black Costume Saga, as well as the Venom Saga, as well as the Green Goblin II Saga, AND be a sequel to the previous two films (not to mention throwing in the Sandman too!).  Perhaps they thought that this would be the end of the franchise and they wanted to get everything out of the way.  The film opens with Peter Parker getting a swelled-head from all the acclaim Spider-Man is receiving and turning into a jerk.  All this seems very uncharacteristic of him and I spent the beginning of the film wondering if the symbiote had already attached itself.  When he does don the black costume, Peter Parker suddenly looks like Robert Smith from The Cure, and he REALLY becomes a jerk.  The worst scene in the film involves a musical/dance number that looks like it should have been in The Mask, not Spider-Man.<br /><br />The result of all this is that not everything gets the attention it deserves.  Venom fans will be most disappointed in this film.  He should have had his own movie.  Instead, he is treated almost as an after-thought.  He is not true to the comic-book character and unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to have his face revert to Eddie Brock almost every time he speaks.<br /><br />Supposedly, there will be three more Spider-Man films.  I don't know what the rest have in store - it feels as though they've exhausted their possibilities.  There are a lot of good things in this film - it is worth seeing.  Just don't get your hopes up too high.</p></body></html>

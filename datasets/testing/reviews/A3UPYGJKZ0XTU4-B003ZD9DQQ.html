<meta name="summary" content="The Chaos, Horror, and Personalities of the Third Reich's Final Days."></head><body><p>"Downfall" depicts the turmoil, delusion, and despair of the last 12 days of the Third Reich in the "F&uuml;hrerbunker",  where Adolph Hitler and some of the Nazi elite sat out the Soviet assault on Berlin in April 1945, 10 meters beneath the Reich Chancellery. This account of events in the bunker is based on the book "Inside Hitler's Bunker" by Joachim Fest, on Traudl Junge's eyewitness account in "Until the Final Hour", written with Melissa M&uuml;ller, on the autobiographies of Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nther Schenck, and on other eyewitness accounts. Traudl Junge was Adolph Hitler's private secretary and one of few surviving witnesses to his last days. She spoke candidly of the harrowing final days in the Chancellery in the 2002 documentary film "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary", and "Downfall" uses her character as a perspective through whom we see the others, particularly Hitler and Eva Braun. Traudl Junge is not strong character, yet she is featured prominently in the midst of much stronger personalities. Actress Alexandra Maria Lara does an impressive job of keeping the audience interested in her.<br /><br />"Downfall" opens in November 1942, as 22-year-old Traudl Humps gets a job as dictation secretary to Adolph Hitler. The film then jumps to Hitler's 56th birthday on April 20, 1945. Traudl has married in the interim years, although no mention is made of it. Her name in now Junge. Hitler (Bruno Ganz) has ordered "Clausewitz" in effect, so all government offices and departments are evacuating Berlin, leaving the city to bedlam and the civilians at the mercy of starvation and the advancing Soviet army. Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethan), among others, urges Hitler to leave Berlin, but he refuses. Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nther Schenck (Christian Berkel) is running around trying to get support for the plight of civilians and wounded. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel places the audience in the middle of this chaos without explanation. The film has a quasi-documentary quality, and it does not create a context for the events that we see, nor does it introduce the characters. It just plunges right in. I think that this technique ultimately heightens feelings of confusion and madness, to "Downfall"'s benefit, but it can sometimes be frustrating. Anyone who is not familiar with the major players in the history of the Third Reich will have trouble figuring out who is who, because most characters are never clearly identified.<br /><br />When "Downfall" moves to the F&uuml;hrerbunker, we find an unhinged Adolph Hitler. The F&uuml;hrer is more hysterical and irrational than usual, can't keep track of his armies, insists that Germany can win the war, and refuses to allow civilians to evacuate the city. Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is frightened and horrified by what she sees but usually calm and consistent in her dictation duties. We observe the conflicts between the generals and SS officers who remain faithful to Hitler's orders and those who wish to act independently, in particular SS-Gruppenf&uuml;hrer Hermann Fegelein (Thomas Krestchmann), the playboy brother-in-law of Eva Braun, who was loyal to Himmler. We see Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), chief architect and Minister of Armaments and War, refuse to carry out Hitler's scorched earth policy. But more interesting than the politics of the Reich's last days are its personalities. Adolph Hitler is delusional, blaming everyone but himself for Germany's imminent defeat. Eva Braun (Juliane K&ouml;hler) is ever the party girl. Josef Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) are fanatical to a fault and contemptuous of Germans. There is constant talk of suicide and cyanide capsules.<br /><br />"Downfall" periodically focuses its attention on the streets above, where the brutal battle for Berlin wages on. The desperate attempts by a brave but defeated army to defend Berlin are gut-wrenching, no matter what side you are on. The character of 12-year-old  Peter Ganz (Donevan Gunia) is intended to be representative of the very young soldiers recruited into the Hitlerjugend in the last days of the war. He is not a real person. "Downfall" makes me wonder how Traudl Junge and the German people could not have noticed that their leaders were stark-raving mad, but I suppose loony politicians are not unusual. I have never understood Adolph Hitler's charisma, and this doesn't help. But Oliver Hirschbiegel and the film's cast have done a great job of bringing the emotions in the Chancellery and on the streets of Berlin in April 1945 to the audience. The film has no score. The 20 rooms of the bunker were recreated as realistically as possible. We are dropped into this tense environment, where the Nazi elite and their staff awaited their doom, practically entombed in 4 meters of concrete already.  "Downfall"'s realism, painstaking accuracy, and delicate performances are an extraordinary accomplishment that make this a masterpiece among war films. In German with English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia Tristar 2005): Bonus features include a making-of documentary, interviews, and an audio commentary. "The Making of Downfall" (1 hour) features interviews with the director, much of the cast, and some others who are not identified, but may be the screenwriter and a historian. The director talks about why he chose to make the film and what he wanted to convey. The actors discuss their characters. And there is a segment about filming in St. Petersburg, Russia.  "Cast and Crew Interviews" includes interviews with director Oliver Hirschbiegel (4 min.), author Melissa M&uuml;ller (8 min.), and actors Bruno Ganz (6 min.), Alexandra Maria Lara (2 min.), and Juliane K&ouml;hler (2 ? min.). Some of the interviews are repeated from the documentary, but I recommend the one with M&uuml;ller. The documentary and interviews are in German with English subtitles. The audio commentary by director Oliver Hirschbiegel is in English. He provides a lot of additional historical details about locations, characters, background, and situations, expounding on each scene.  I highly recommend the commentary.</p></body></html>

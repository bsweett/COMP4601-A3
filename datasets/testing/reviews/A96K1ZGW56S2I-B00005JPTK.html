Years earlier a cure for cancer was developed by changing the structure of a virus.  The cure was heralded throughout the world until the virus begins to mutate and begins a plague. New York City is quarantined, but Neville stays behind in an attempt to find a cure.  Years later, except for his faithful dog, he is still alone.  He spends his days hunting for survivors, gathering supplies, and trying to find a cure.  But that's only during the day.  Before evening, he returns to his home and barricades himself in for the night.  For at night, the people that have been infected by the plague and are still alive come out of hiding, seeking for flesh to eat and blood to drink.  These mutated zombie-vampires are hungry and not only want to find Neville to eat him, but to seek vengeance for what they have become.  As the movie unfolds, it becomes a cat and mouse race as Neville attempts to outwit the creatures and find a cure before they find his home and destroy humanity's only hope.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND is loosely based upon the classic vampire short story of the same name by Richard Matheson.  Other than the main character's name and the general exposition of the plot, I AM LEGEND is unlike the original story.  Fans of the story (myself included) might be disappointed by the adaptation.  Yet, despite straying from the source material, I AM LEGEND works really well as movie in its own right.  The ending of the film does seem rushed and is very different from the ending of the story, yet the overall spirit of the book is intact and the ending of the film makes it clear that Robert Neville is a hero to be admired, a legend.<br /><br />I enjoyed I AM LEGEND.  Will Smith is a very talented actor and I usually enjoy watching him on screen.  I really liked Richard Matheson's original story, and though I was disappointed by certain aspects of the book's latest adaptation, I thought the filmmakers did a great job in making a good and solid movie that stays true to the spirit of the original story.  I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the film that was composed of almost entirely Bob Marley music.<br /><br />Recommended for Will Smith fans, people who like vampire and zombie movies, and anyone who just likes a good dramatic-adventure/sci-fi movie.</p></body></html>

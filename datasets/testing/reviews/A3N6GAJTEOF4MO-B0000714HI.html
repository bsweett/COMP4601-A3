Waynes World pointed out the camp, moronic nature of many hardcore old school rock fans and their dedication for the genre. Austin Powers is a character that defines the campness of the groovy 60s, not necessarily hippie fashion, but more fun loving groovy cats who just wanted to have a good time.<br /><br />The character is broadly based around James bond and the velvet suit with Beatle Boots was actually worn by a George Lazenby incarnation of Bond. Mike Myers took his humour and expressed it in a character that worked on so many levels and took him to the sky in relation to recognition, and arguably the success of this particular will never be matched. With Austin Powers, Myers has now run the risk of the character becoming bigger than the actor and the humour itself. The catchphrases and groovy look are great and present a fun atmosphere, but this now runs the risk of the catchphrases overtaking any form of introduction of new humour.<br /><br />The character is no bad thing and the silly wit from the mind of Myers only helps the movies, but unless it was Myers intention, the character has now become bigger than its creator and it is obvious in this film. The story focuses around Austin who faces a new foe who teams up with Dr. Evil. The new foes name I hear you ask? Goldmember, and his criminal calling card is turning his victims members gold. Goldmember and Dr. Evil team up to build a tractor beam that will pull a meteor into the earth and melt the ice caps. Austin, with the help of a new companion by the name of Foxxy Cleopatra, has to travel back to 1975 to save his father and stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember.<br /><br />The plot's simple enough don't you think? I suppose what Myers sought to achieve with this was character progression more than anything as we see Dr. Evils son, Scott become evil. The new character of Goldmember is something not too appealing in the film, as it seems he's there to simply promote some form of "look how the foreigner talks funny" vibe, and the joke gets really old quite quickly. After about the first 5 minutes of being familiar with Goldmember, I think even Myers realised this character couldn't achieve anything better and after his original "comic" entrance he just ended up sitting in silence a lot.<br /><br />The real introductory gems of the entire film are Foxxy Cleopatra played by the devinely beautiful Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, and Nigel Powers played by the legendary Michael Caine who looks surprisingly young. Foxxy Cleopatra is the breath of fresh air in what generally is a redoing of all the old gags. She's a woman with talent and attitude and is like many women before her, after Austins heart. Michael Caine seems very much at home playing Nigel Powers as it seems a character very close to his own personality. The cheeky cockney geezer always up for a good time with the ladies is something very befitting of Caine.<br /><br />The setting is great and the comedy is just fantastic (the new stuff anyway) but I felt the movie fell short. Apart from the genuinely amazing intro and the odd bit here and there, the film just felt a lot like the previous two with a lot of the old gags done once again. Once is fantastic, twice is okay, but the same joke for the third time becomes a bit tiresome. I have to wonder that with a fourth installment in the works, just how soon will it be before Myers decides to drop the old boring jokes and create some new ones.</p></body></html>

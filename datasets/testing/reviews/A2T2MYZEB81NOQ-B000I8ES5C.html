<meta name="summary" content="It was, shall we say, a put-together of great and horrid?"></head><body><p>When this movie started, it was dreadful. Lots of stupid stuff, and  not good enough acting. Also not very funny humor. However, there was one good thing about the first half-the battle scenes. They were great, but it only heightened my liking a small amount. Then there was the second half. More fighting, less dumb humor, and a lot more coolness, especially in the final fight. It was awesome. And I loved the ending, where the protagonist and the girl he knew for trying to save got together again, and married each other. I do think they'll be a grand couple. Though it was a good second half, there was just to much loser stuff and stupidity at the start for it to be one of my top movies. But, it  was OK overall, and I thought I'd hate it. Good thing I gave it a  chance to finish. This is the kind of movie you should see if you have nothing else to do(at least in my opinion).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The June and Johnny story is more like it"></head><body><p>The story basically was about how Johnny wanted June very badly, and how long it took for them to get together. After they get together, the movie ends quickly. I dont know Johnny or June to much, the acting was good but not excellent. I thought Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as June though. The part that I rolled my eyes at was an almost minute scene with Johnny with Waylon Jennings, who was played by his son, Skeeter Jennings. I thought it was a little tacky and would have prefered to see someone play Bob Dylan. Plus forget to tell the story about Johnny kicking out the lights at the Grand Ol Opry. That would have been cool to see. Go see it for Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, other then that, a weak biography of the man in black.</p></body></html>

Ok where to start there are so much bad things ok let me begging with the bad things.<br /><br />1.The first half hour was so pointless nothing happend.<br /><br />2.In the first hour theres just sex, more sex, more sex and yes more sex. Yes I can see sex in horoor movies but this was just pointless.<br /><br />3. The acting was beyond terriable<br /><br />4. There is no real plot to the movie<br /><br />5. The charactors are all stupid they all deserve to die. Now come on would you walk in an abanded factory NO and the main charactor dose are that stupid.<br /><br />6. It was not scary or gross<br /><br />Ok now let me say the good things<br /><br />1. The one and only good thing was the last 20 min when things got interesting and the main charactor tries to escape.<br /><br />Over dont waste your time with this pointless trash moive.</p></body></html>

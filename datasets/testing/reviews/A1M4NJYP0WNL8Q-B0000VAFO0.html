It is a very competent, if stagecrafty, vampire film.  It features lots of atmosphere and dramatic, gothic filmogaphy.  It takes place in a setting that is half Prague and half London - underground scenes, castle scenes and even a chase or two.  Stunts and costumes are excellent - the film uses costumes and stunts rather than CGI for it's effects - for a result that is, as someone else remarked, half Dracula and half Matrix.<p>The premise isn't completely original, but is well worked out, making vampires and lycans (werewolves) a kind of medical accident arising in the depth of the plague years developing a complex hierarchical society with vampires at the to and the werewolves at the bottom.  This somehow impacted, and lycans and vampires are at war, with the werewolves at a disadvantage.<p>In the midst of a hunt Selene (Kate Beckensale) finds that a nest of werewolves is determined to capture a human - Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Her investigation puts her at odds with her coven's leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and the ensuing events reveal something so menacing that vampire and lycan are threatened.<p>In essence this is a pure action film not a horror film.  There are gestures at romance and the politics of the night but the primary movement is set scene - chase scene - fight scene.  While the acting is generally competent - Beckensale is quite good, and Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are excellent as lycan and vampire elders - it isn't spectacular.  Certainly not good enough to make what director Ken Wiseman thought might be 'the greatest vampire story ever told.'<p>Seen purely as what it is, 'Underworld' is an enjoyable, fast-paced film that presents in interesting vision of life in the darkness.  Held against an arbitrary standard of greatness or a belief that it is the deconstruction of the vampire mythos, it falls short.  The Dracula remake is still the pinnacle of this genre, and may be for some time to come.  One the other hand I could watch films like this one after another without a single qualm.<p>The extras, feature films on the making of , etc., and several commentaries are excellent, and throw some interesting light on the film and its characters.  If you like foreboding technogothic thrillers this is made for you.</p></body></html>

Denzel Washington's character is smart, mean and selfish.  He plays folks from both sides of the line to his advantage.  This movie is full of violence and double crossing and it continues on a straight line through all the perceived turns.  Denzel's character is mean from the beginning, you just don't see it.  He is the true meaning of the word 'player'.  He manipulates everyone around him. <p>The movie leaves you thinking throughout, is he a good guy gone bad?  A good guy trying to help?  Or a bad guy posing as a good one?  <p>Denzel does a find job (one of his best but his absolute best?)and Ethen Hawke does an extraordinary job as the rookie on his first day, the &quot;training day&quot;.  With a cameo by Tom Berrenger and a small part for Scott Glenn this movie is cutting. <p>Take notice though - in the final scene the van disappears!  Watch and you'll understand.</p></body></html>

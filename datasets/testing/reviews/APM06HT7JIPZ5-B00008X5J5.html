Now, I personally cannot stand SNOW WHITE, believe it or not; the princess is so darned obnoxious, and the prince has no personality whatsoever.  Then came CINDERELLA, which was a much better film but still not really great.  For one thing, the princess was a very likable character; but once again, the prince was so incredibly lifeless that when they finally lived Happily Ever After, one couldn't care less.  Eight or nine years later, Walt Disney delivered SLEEPING BEAUTY, by far the best animated fairy tale so far.  Though the princess isn't as intriguing as those of more modern Disney films, Princess Aurora is along the same lines as Cinderella.  But the one thing that I found the most groundbreaking about this film (storywise) is the prince; he finally had a personality, maybe even more so than the princess!  Thankfully, the trend lasted throughout the rest of Disney's Princess films, but that's not to say that it's the best thing about this film.<p>Although this film obviously borrows some elements from SNOW WHITE and CINDERELLA, the viewer couldn't possibly care less, thanks to all of the film's strengths.  Besides the aforementioned Prince Phillip, there's also the art to consider: in many ways, it is the pinnacle of Disney animation (and that's saying something!)  The entire film truly looks like a moving illustration/story book, more so than any film before or since.  And the backgrounds seamlessly compliments the characters, and vice versa.  Thanks to the ingenuity and style of artist Eyvind Earle (whom I have actually met in person), SLEEPING BEAUTY remains a beautiful work of art.<p>Another aspect of the movie that I have always loved dearly is the music.  Adapted from the Peter Tchaikovsky ballet, its a masterful composition, indeed.  For the score's highlight(s), view scenes 26-28 . . . . . . . . absolutely riveting.  That one part where Prince Phillip leaps across the bridge on his noble steed, and Maleficent rises to her tower to deliver an onslaught of black magic, sends shivers down my spine every time.  A perfect blend of animation and music if ever there was.<p>And now, this all-new 2-disc DVD enhances the film further than ever before, with one of the greatest transfers of all time.  The picture really is, quite frankly, flawless.  All except for one single shot of the castle tower. Aside from that, utter perfection.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound brings the music to extraordinary life like never before.<p>The extras are where the set begins to waver a bit.  For starters, the Making-Of &quot;documentary&quot;, is only 15 friggin' minutes long!!!!!!!!  I HATE how Disney does this.  But no matter how short it is, it delivers interesting tidbits.  But don't give up hope too quickly, as I did.  There's a lot more spread out across this disc; it's more like they broke up the full-length making-of into seperate sections here and there, and if you put it all together, it's quite good.  But the best extra for me was the original 1950's featurette &quot;Four Artists Paint One Tree&quot;.  It's a fascinating look at different artists and their diverse, unique styles.  Also fascinating is to see how seamlessly all four styles were molded into the art for SLEEPING BEAUTY.<p>Conclusion:  With the releases of this and THE LION KING, Disney has changed their DVD style: focus more on the actual film, and not wholly on the extras (like they did with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST).  SLEEPING BEAUTY is a classic film to be cherished as long as the art of the motion picture remains, and this Special Edition DVD is to be treasured just as long.</p></body></html>

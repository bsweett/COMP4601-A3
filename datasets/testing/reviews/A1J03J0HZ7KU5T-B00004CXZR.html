<meta name="summary" content=""Director's Cut" Should Have Boldly Gone Further"></head><body><p>There's little argument that Robert Wise's belated "director's cut" of "Star Trek - The Motion Picture" is an improvement over the original 1979 release. However, this big-screen debut represents the weakest (and slowest) of the series, partially redeemed by some awe-inspiring visual effects and Jerry Goldsmith's classic score. The camaraderie between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is sadly lacking, while the remaining Enterprise players are overshadowed by the unnecessary addition of Captain Decker (a horrible performance from Stephen Collins). Luckily, you can hit the warp-speed button during the film's several "longueurs," which Wise should have pared down even further. Though flawed, "Star Trek - The Motion Picture" succeeds as a preview of better voyages to come.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best and last epic american film ever made"></head><body><p>To say it in few words: Patton is the most genuine state of epic spirit you feel since the first shots. The supeb visual impact you receive when Patton gives his speech with the american flag behind him still remain in our memory.<br /><br />What can we add underlying the superb performing of George C. Scott? . More than an actor, Scott was a model. You feel Patton and forget half an hour after to Scott, because he melts with the character and disappears before us, in a mesmerizing way that you could compare without any effort to Marlon Brando.<br />Franklin Schaffner was a talented director. Imagine the caleidoscopic twist that means going from The planet of the apes to Patton and ending with Nicholas and Alexandra.<br /><br />The camera' s handling , the brilliant sequences of the desert{s battle, the insights of the General are described and supported by a genial script.<br /><br />There's a worthy point which deserves to mention: the reflections of Patton when he's in the battlefield remembering that somehow he was there, reminding the echoes of the Greeks who fought centuries ago. It's a powerful metaphor but told with such kind of force that you remind to Alejandro Magno and Achilles with making use of the emotive memories.<br /><br />What has it happened then after this movie?<br /><br />Patton is an emblematic personality the hero' s essence encarnated in the middle of the XX Century.<br /><br />The epic sense reachs his goals through the great triumphs, the innovative strategies, that only you can establish another brilliant soldier who was Mc Arthur in the other side of the world.<br /><br />I' m sure that Moshe Dayan understood the essence of this General since his student days. I haven't seen any interview in this sense but somehow in my mind and in my spirit tells me that I'm right.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="meh on content, wow on scenery"></head><body><p>It's a beautifully filmed, nicely edited, with particular attention to special effects, film that has an uncertain plot and a weird understanding of the world and its audience. It's the kind of movie that no one really understands but appreciates its sincerity and accomplishment. At the end of the day though, it's not a film that I would rewatch or watch the sequel to it. As it is, I'm glad I saw it in IMAX because, as i mentioned above, the film is visually stunning.</p></body></html>

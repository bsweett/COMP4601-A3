<meta name="summary" content="An action movie where you dread the action."></head><body><p>"The Hurt Locker" has just won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture and it truly earns it. Here is a war movie that takes no real position on war, and especially no position on the Iraq War, and simply shows the mental and physical brutality and beauty of conflict.<br /><br />You know the story by now. It centers around a bomb disposal and disarmament team in Iraq who throw themselves into harm's way on a regular basis in order to make life safer for their fellow soldiers and civilians. The team receives a new member, played by the fantastic Jeremy Renner, who is something of a wild card. Soon he and everyone else are pulled into his own personal brand of insanity as he comes to realize that without the war, he's nothing.<br /><br />It's a simple concept and wonderfully executed by Kathryn Bigelow and her team. It was filmed on location in the Middle East and you really get a sense of what life is like that part of the world for our soldiers and the civilians who live there. You bear witness to some of the day-to-day tragedies that happen (admittedly not as much now as they did in 2004 when this movie is apparently set), like a man forced into a suicide bombing. It's a harrowing look at an unpleasant reality.<br /><br />I mention in the title of the review that it's an action movie where you dread the action. This is entirely true. You really start to become quite fond of the three bomb techs, and when the bullets start flying and things start exploding, you worry about them. You want nothing more than for them to go back to their base, nice and safe, and not venture out into the dangerous world. It's something I've not come across in an action-type film, and I'm glad to see it here.<br /><br />Was this actually the best movie of 2009? Well, yes. It won't have the long-term influence of "Avatar", but it is overall better than that film. I'm glad it won and I'm glad I've seen it.</p></body></html>

Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, and calls himself the Colonel Sanders of Nicotine.  He's divorced, but stays very involved in Joey's (his twelve year old son) life.  Joey (Cameron Bright - Running Scared, The Butterfly Effect) looks up to his father, often seeing him in a Godlike way.<br /><br />Nick belongs to what they call the MOD Squad (Merchants Of Death).  He and his two friends, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello - Secret Window) who works for the Moderation Council and is an alcoholic, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) who works for SAFETY (The Society for the Advancement of Firearms and Effective Training for Youth), meet for lunch one a week and discuss the deaths related to their current jobs.<br /><br />The movie begins with Nick appearing on the Joan Lunden show, against anti-tobacco groups and a young boy suffering from tobacco related cancer.  Nick, the best of the spin-artists, walks away smelling like a rose.  On his case over his defense of Big Tobacco is Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who leads a sub-committee dedicated to labeling cigarettes with the skull and crossbones poison symbol.<br /><br />Nick, while waiting for the sub-committee hearing, travels to see The Captain (Robert Duvall), head of the tobacco company and founder of Nick's employer.  Nick's boss stole his idea to use Hollywood to promote tobacco (by getting stars to smoke on screen) and the Captain wants Nick to fly to California to get the ball rolling.  Taking Joey along, Nick meets with Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), a Hollywood super agent who heads up EGO (Entertainment Global Offices).  (Jeff and the whole Hollywood scene is so over-the-top "typical" that it's hilarious)  Jeff and Nick agree on 25 Million dollars to get Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones to smoke on screen after a futuristic $ex scene. (unbelievable!)  While in California, he takes a huge money payoff to the original Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott) who's now dying of lung cancer.  He also appears on the Dennis Miller show against Senator Finistirre, and receives a death threat from a caller.<br /><br />Nick comments on his life as being the most hated person on Earth.  It's pretty much true.  He's kidnapped, stripped, covered in nicotine patches and left at the Lincoln statue.  He almost dies and can never smoke again because of the overdose, but spins it into how cigarettes saved his life because a non-smoker would have died.  The reporter he's dating, Heather, takes all their private pillow talks and publishes an extremely derogatory article about him.  (You'll have to watch the movie to see how he pays her back)  Nick has to balance his life between his moral-less job and being a father to his son.  The things he teaches Joey aren't right or wrong but how to win, an approach Joey's mother disapproves of.<br /><br />Whether you're a non-smoker or even a smoker, the actions of the Big Tobacco will make you red with fury.  Eckhart plays a good role as Nick, totally unconcerned with his job as lobbyist for a known killer.  (as expressed in the meetings of the MOD Squad)  Though not based on a true story or even real statistical facts, the casual way Big Tobacco treats their "customer's" lives rings true.  Adding in Polly and Bobby Ray as advocates of alcohol and firearms holds a certain irony to the film.  Though the movie has a good premise (as far as satire goes) and an excellent cast who all perform well, it never quite advances itself into either comedy or drama.  The pace is a little to slow, and the debates not long enough or heated enough.  It's interesting enough if you want to watch a benignly evil man do his effort to spread poison, but not worthy of a purchase.  Rent first.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

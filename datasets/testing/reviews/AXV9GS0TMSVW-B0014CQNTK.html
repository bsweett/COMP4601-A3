Yet its his direction that often makes this work so well.  Juno is Reitman's second feature.  Like his first feature, "Thank You For Smoking," he's dealt with the task of taking a hot button issue, making it funny, and thereby not making it an issue.  This is why Juno works - And it's the team of Reitman, Cody, and Paige that make the whole thing come together.<br /><br />The script reminds of a Kevin Smith script for a slightly younger less stoned generation.  That is to say that the dialogue is hip, sharp, and quick.  Not only is it fun and reverent, but it doesn't drag.  Some people have griped about the unnatural way people talk in this film and that's when you have to looks at some of the best comedy scripts in recent years and you realize that writers like Cody and Smith carve out their own worlds in their stories.  It feels natural in the world of Juno that Juno can quip at the store clerk about her pregnancy test and he'll give a clever quip back.<br /><br />That actors in this movie bring Cody's clever dialogue to life.  While Ellen Paige carries a lot of the scripts weight, she's also supported by wonderful character actor JK Simmons as Juno's father.  In all the fun, the relationship with Juno's family is addressed very sincerely.<br /><br />What makes the film work above all things though is how, as stated earlier, this is not a movie about teen pregnancy.  Think of it as a device and you'll get the politics out of your system.  Cody's script is more about love, friendship, and maturity.  The film is a feel good film, but the relationships in the film are complex.  Cody's script and Reitman's direction keep you interested til the end giving a very satisfying conclusion.</p></body></html>

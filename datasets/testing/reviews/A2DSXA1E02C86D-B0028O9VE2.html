<meta name="summary" content="Can Paz Vega be my housekeeper?"></head><body><p>The plot of SPANGLISH has been described as "the story of a Mexican woman and her daughter who travel all the way to Los Angeles to bring sanity to a crazy Anglo family." Right. That's like defining World War II as a minor squabble that discomfited Europe and the Far East.<br /><br />The gorgeous Spanish (as in Spain) actress Paz Vega makes her American screen debut as Flor, who, with her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), travel up from Mexico to SoCal for the employment opportunities. (Whether they're "documented" or not is, in this politically correct age, left to the imagination.) Though she speaks no English, Flor lands a job as a housekeeper with the well-to-do Clasky family, which includes the Mister, John (Adam Sandler), the Missus, Deborah (Tea Leoni), daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele), and Deborah's resident, alcoholic mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman). There's also a Clasky son, but his role is so minor as to go virtually unnoticed. When necessary, Cristina, who speaks English like a native, translates for her Mom. There must be wonderful language schools for the economically challenged south of the border.<br /><br />Flor, whose role eventually evolves to live-in maid as the household migrates from Beverly Hills to a rented Malibu beach house for the summer, stumbles into a tense situation. Deborah is unsatisfied with her marriage. John, owner/#1 chef of a four-star restaurant, is Mr. Nice Guy without a clue. Deborah has an awkward relationship with Bernice, who, overweight and with dental braces, doesn't meet Mom's expectations; Deborah seemingly has no relationship with her son at all, good or bad; Deborah disapproves of Evelyn's constant drinking. Deborah spends her time running to keep in shape and satisfy some inner concept of self image. Come to think of it, Deborah doesn't do much of anything. The plot's conflict emerges as Deborah begins to treat the perfect Cristina as her own daughter without Flor's permission, e.g., having their hair highlighted together, and getting Cristina enrolled in a prestigious private school. In the meantime, John is rendered incoherent by Flor's beauty and warmth, but, being a decent fellow, he doesn't do anything about it that might otherwise be expected of a male with normal hormone levels.<br /><br />Superficially, SPANGLISH has appeal. Deborah remains engaging even as she verges on Total Bitch. (OK, ok. I think Tea Leoni is a Hottie.) And there are some genuinely funny moments, as when Cristina translates an overwrought outburst by Flor, complete with vigorous hand and arm waving, and when Evelyn sobers up and tells her daughter to snap out of it. My biggest problem is with Paz Vega as Flor. She's truly eye candy I can appreciate, but I think the producers of the film want the audience to react to her as did the stupefied John, i.e., assign her a separate gender altogether based on looks. When Flor and Cristina walk off into the California sunset at the film's conclusion, all the difficulties back at the Clasky house are left unresolved. Indeed, the resentment that Bernice felt for having her place in Mom's affections co-opted by Cristine was never even dealt with. So, what was all this except a beauty contest with Vega as the preordained winner?<br /><br />While I'm allowing for the fact that the point of the film was perhaps to introduce Paz to American audiences, I still felt manipulated more than the norm by the scriptwriters. If you want to see a substantive role in current release by an acknowledged screen beauty, see CLOSER starring Julia Roberts. Granted, it's not a comedy, or even something for the whole family, but at least it's not fluff masquerading as a movie with a message.</p></body></html>

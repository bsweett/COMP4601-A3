<meta name="summary" content="A Great Indiana Jones Finale But Could Have Picked A Better Actor For The Son"></head><body><p>I've always been an Indiana Jones fan and always will be so of course I'm a little bias with this movie but I don't think by much.  The one thing people have to remember is eighteen years have gone by so Indy can't still be fighting the nazis any more so we come up with the Soviets during the cold war era.  I also think the movies story quest about the crystal skulls was also pretty good and I think it depends on the person points of view whether or not the crystal skulls were truly alien in origin.  I don't want to give away to much so you'll just have to see the movie and see what I'm talking about.  The one downside I think was the actor who played Indy's son I'm not saying he was a bad actor but he just seemed a little lame to be Indy's son not to be cruel.  It's to bad we cant go back in time a little because if you've seen the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles I think the actor Sean Patrick Flannery would have been great to play Indy's son in the movie.  I do also like that they brought back the original actress who played Marion in the first Indy movie that brought a little nostalgia back for me. The blu-ray dvd does do the job the video is superb and the audio is incredible a great job done for the blu-ray dvd.  So if you're like me and have the Indiana Jones movies as well as the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles set finish your collection and get this final incredible movie for yourself right away...</p></body></html>

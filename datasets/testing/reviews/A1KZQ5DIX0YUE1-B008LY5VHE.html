<meta name="summary" content="The Shark Still Works"></head><body><p>** This is a review of the BD/DVD 100th anniversary edition **<br /><br />I don't know where to start.<br /><br />The digital restoration is amazing, especially in regards to Bruce (the shark). The feature AND most of the extras are all in 7.1 sound. The BD is slammed full of special features covering everything from the musical score, extras, interviews, and all sorts of chum in the waters. There are more than two HOURS of bonus material, but alas: no commentary. Dollar for dollar, quote for quote, this is the version a true JAWS fan wants. Everything else is left wanting.<br /><br />The Shark Still Works, and it looks great!</p></body></html>

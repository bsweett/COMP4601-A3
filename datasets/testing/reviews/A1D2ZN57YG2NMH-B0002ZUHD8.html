This one, though not near so magical, depicts him, Lancelot, and Guinevere in a much better light. Instead of all the adultry and death, we are left a triumphant ending, and a noble death for Lancelot. I think the unrated version is probably the one to see, for the extended battles and longer scenes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent, engaging film with a great cast"></head><body><p>Doubt is an excellent, engaging film with a great cast led by Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film is set in 1964, in a Catholic elementary school in New York City. Streep plays the principal of the school, a very traditional and rigid nun. Hoffman plays a priest in the parish, with more progressive views. The story focuses on a conflict between these two characters. It is one of those thought-provoking films that compels you to talk about it afterward, since it allows the viewer to absorb the story based on one's own background and perspective.</p></body></html>

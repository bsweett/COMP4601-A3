<meta name="summary" content="How to ruin a good movie series in 4 steps -"></head><body><p>1. you have only 1 original character return to the series. 2. You kill off the 2nd main character (sara connor).  3. You replace the 3rd important character (sara's son) with an actor so bland your praying he gets terminated quickly.  4. Then shoot the whole mess in someone's back yard without the spectacular special effects that made this series so watchable.  I'll never know why Arnold didn't insist that the original cast be reunited one last time to finish off the story intact.  Well, whatever, I'm sure it was a money/greed decision.  I rarely like these kind of movie series, but, this one had heart and personality.  Too bad and too sad.</p></body></html>

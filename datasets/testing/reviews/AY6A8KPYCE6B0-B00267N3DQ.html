Other than being the first feature-length animation ever, it's also one of the most humorous, charming, memorable movies ever made.<br /><br />But of course, you've already seen the movie (probably a 100 or more times) and really you want to know if this Blu Ray transfer is worth replacing your other copy.  The simple answer:  YES.<br /><br />The standards set by this Diamond release has really got me excited about future releases from the series, because I assure you it is jam packed with goodies, and even more importantly, the digital restoration is absolutely stunning.  For a 73 year old movie, it looks so good it might has well been made last year.  It's presented in its original ratio of 1:33:1 which is essentially a square. While if you have a wide screen TV there will be those kind of unpleasant looking black bars on the side.  No fear, however, as Disney has ever so creatively found a way to make even those look beautiful.  If you select to watch the "DisneyView" experience, they insert beautiful artwork in the sections where the black bars would be.  The art is usually a red velvet curtain, or marble  lining, or something to give the picture a look of stunning presentation.  The color palette of the artwork always matches the scene of the movie so you almost don't even realize it's not part of the film.  An amazing feature!<br /><br />Other special goodies included are deleted scenes, which are quite cute, information on "Snow White Returns" which was a recently discovered storyline for a animation short where Snow White comes to visit the dwarfs and they decide to make her a bed as a present.  There's also some segments on the theatrical debut of Snow White which is of course very exciting.  Walt was such a showman! I had no idea that he presented the film in a DisneyLand like setting.<br /><br />Even as animation takes a drastic 3D turnaround, early Disney 2D movies will be forever remembered and no collection of them would be complete without the gracious (and a little air heady) Snow White, her animal entourage, and her seven short friends.  With this new Blu Ray release you can be sure that you are getting the absolute best copy of the film to date, and it will make the movie only that much more magical for you.</p></body></html>

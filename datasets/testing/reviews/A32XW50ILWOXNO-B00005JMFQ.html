<meta name="summary" content="A British "good, bad and ugly" for the holidays."></head><body><p>Writer-director Richard Curtis intends his Christmas-themed, indulgently operatic "Love Actually" to be an Altmanesque tour of comic romance dashed with London wit. It is and it isn't: While a handful of the dozen or so couplings produce funny, poignant scenes, others border on insult, and never does the ensemble piece come together in its entirety. British humor is more literate, but, in many cases, no less shameless. <p>The movie is so protracted and bracketed into segments you can divide it into categories: <p>Terribly good: Hugh Grant, as usual, as the British Prime Minister sweet on his buxom, foul-mouthed catering manager (Martine McCutcheon). While their attraction is quite like a president/intern tryst with which we're all so familiar, Grant is such a daft fool we don't mind. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman accurately portray a married couple rocked by infidelity. Though others may groan at it, I liked a bit story about a good guy who loves his best friend's new wife (Keira Knightley). Ditto for the aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who recaptures the pop charts with an ugly "Christmas" remake of an old tune. <p>A Bit Sordid: The story of a luckless-in-love American woman (Laura Linney) saddled with a mentally ill brother - who, uh, also happens to be in London - is better suited to its own story. Liam Neeson is good as a widow whose young stepson has fallen in love, but Curtis takes the sugar too far. <p>Bloody awful: A ludicrous cross-cultural romance between a crime writer (Colin Firth) and his Portugeuse maid, and an awkward, stupid meet cute of body doubles on a film set. Both, however, are trumped by British geek's quest to bed sex crazed American women. <p>"Love Actually" is loaded with odd quirks. Black actors are cast throughout the movie as sidekicks in an obsequious, almost proplike manner, and Curtis digs on fat people with no particular point in mind. A subplot involving Grant's PM and a creepy American president (Billy Bob Thornton, entirely unconvincing) is heavyhanded. And one of the body doubles is a disturbing lookalike of Mia Farrow in "Rosemary's Baby." <p>Curtis, who wrote "Notting Hill" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral", is talented, but his arrogance peeks through, and his directing doesn't play away from it. In certain moments, the movie projects something resmebling disgust. <p>And yet the other moments, the good zingers, are worth a single viewing. Grant caroling. Thompson, putting together her husband's imperfections to a Joni Mitchell song. Rowan Atkinson in a snappy little cameo as a fastidious department store clerk. A scene where Knightley's character "gets it." Now that Curtis has the bravado out of his system, his sophomore directing effort should be more focused on those kinds of moments, and less fixated on delivering the world a giant love letter.</p></body></html>

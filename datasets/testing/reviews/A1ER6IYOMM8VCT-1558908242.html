<meta name="summary" content="A MODERN CINEMA MASTERPIECE! GREAT TWO DISCS EDITION!"></head><body><p>After watching the abysmal 'Plump Fiction' I had to revisit the original modern masterpiece! 'Pulp Fiction' is responsible for giving new life to a few actors careers and having completely set a new standard for modern films. The film is filled with rich dialogue and performances.<br /><br />A neat 3 story line ingeniously woven into an unforgettable movie. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson became instant box office gold from their portrayals of two hit men in this film and Travolta's career went from almost nonexistent to top dog. Eric Stoltz portrayal of a stoner drug dealer is pitch perfect as is Rosanna Arquette as his wife. Bruce Willis as Butch the boxer is also in top form and Uma Thurman has never been better. The smaller character roles by Roth, Plummer, Keitel, Walken and Rhames are equally impressive and there isn't a false note in this ultra entertaining rollercoaster ride of a movie.<br /><br />Tarantino's sly use of tired story lines that he turns upside down is nothing short of genius! It's a film that needs to be seen several times to be fully understood. If you haven't seen it you have missed one of the best films of the last 20 years.<br /><br />The two discs set sports an excellent transfer and has a ton of great extras including commentary, on screen facts, excellent deleted scenes explained on screen by Tarantino, trailers, TV spots, Siskel & Ebert show devoted to Tarantino, Charlie Rose show devoted to Tarantino, on the set documentary, feature-ette, montages and the list goes on and on!</p></body></html>

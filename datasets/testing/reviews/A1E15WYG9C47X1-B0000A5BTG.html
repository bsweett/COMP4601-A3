<meta name="summary" content="The Core is Shallow"></head><body><p>I love Sci fi movies and I truly appreciate how the digital and technological advances have served movie making in the last few years, helping to take the viewer to a level, that was in itself in the realm of science fiction..But one thing I love in a movie, is to forget that I am watching one, and be totally engaged in it regardless of the genre.<br />The Core, put simply, was unable to achieve this most basic requirement.<br />The problem with the film revolves mainly around two reasons,<br />The first are the digital effects.<br />Primarily their purpose is to take the viewer into a world of make believe,and dazzle and entertain him/her in the process.In the Core, I was constantly AWARE of these effects, time and time again, which tended to be overwhelming without being impressive. The ship looked like a cigar case, while the earth's insides looked like a computer generated goo.<br />Sci fi films of the past, and the first Star Wars is one very good example, became such hits by using comparatively speaking primitive effects (miniatures..), but their success was due to the fact that the viewer was so engaged in the film that he/she were either not aware of the technicalities of the sets/action or did not really care..This alas was absent from the Core.<br />The second reason behind The Core's failure in my opinion, was the emphasis on character.Let me explain..<br />If you watch the making of, the director and producer stress over and over again that their film is not merely effects but is character based as well,and much deeper than its genre would suggest.<br />I have a problem with that..Because on one hand there is nothing wrong with films (Sci fi/horror/action) who do not pretend to be deeper than they really are, but offer sheer escapist entertainment..There are countless excellent films that are actors based and are zillion years better.<br />On the other hand, watching the Core, and with lines like 'the world is destiny and the destiny is the world' you really wonder where on earth is this character based angle of the film? There are such similar lines in the film that gives you that nauseous feeling you have after eating too much cheese!<br />The actors who signed for the film are very good, especially Hilary Swank and Stanley Tucci(but his character came out more like a dandy bon vivant than the genius scientist he is supposed to be).<br />To be fair, and to give credit where credit is due, some of the effects, especially the crazed pigeons in Trafalgar Square were well done, but they seem so much like isolated scenes that do not make one whole movie.<br />The film could have been much better, with its simple story of a group of scientists trying to restart the rotation of earth electromagnetic field, and save the world, had digital effects been less in 'your face' and had the filmmakers not troubled themselves too much with their emphasis on characters,a nd taken themselves and their film less seriously ..but alas they did not, and as a result that Core is very shallow.</p></body></html>

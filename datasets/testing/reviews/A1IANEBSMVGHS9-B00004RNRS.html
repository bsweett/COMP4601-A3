<meta name="summary" content="Magnificent! One of the best movies ever, indeed."></head><body><p>Could you believe anyone may have seen "The Sound of Music" for the first time forty years after it came out? Well, that was me, today. I had seen bits and pieces, of course, and had obviously heard the classic songs (who hadn't, right?). But I just finished watching the movie in its entirety (it lasts close to three hours) for the first time ever, and it truly is as magnificent as everyone said it was.<br /><br />The story is simple, yet powerful: a story of search, love and struggle, starring Julie Andrews playing Maria, a woman who leaves an Austrian convent to assist Captain Georg von Trapp (Michael Plummer), a widower Navy officer with the upbringing of his seven children. The acting of the adults and the children actors is impeccable and the music is so ingrained into the story that one is impossible to conceive without the other, yet it hardly feels like a musical.<br /><br />"The Sound of Music" has got to be without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in my life and a story I will hold dear to my heart.</p></body></html>

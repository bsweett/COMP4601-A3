<meta name="summary" content="Absolute comic brilliance, Dude"></head><body><p>The Big Lebowski is a work of comic genius; it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Jeff Bridges is hilarious as "the Dude," a pretty simple guy whose life goes all kinds of topsy-turvy after he's mistaken for someone else with the same name - Jeffrey Lebowski.  John Goodman is hilarious as his best friend Walter Sobchak, a boisterous Vietnam vet with a quick temper and a pathological need to jump in and take decisive action all the time, and Steve Buscemi is his usual entertaining self as the only reasonably sane person in the entire film.  The Big Lebowski is really all about dialogue and delivery.  The script is just wickedly funny from start to finish, but it is Bridges' laid-back delivery that really makes the comic engine go, with all kinds of help from John Goodman.<br /><br />The Dude comes home one night, only to find himself thrown face-down in the toilet and otherwise accosted by two chaps demanding money to pay off his wife's debts.  He finally manages to convince the guys that he is not the Jeffrey Lebowski they are looking for - but not before one of the jokers gives his rug a golden shower.  The Dude is not at all happy about this, as "that rug really tied the room together."  After consulting with his bowling partners (the Dude spends a lot of time bowling), he decides to find the other, obviously rich Lebowski and ask him to reimburse him for the rug.  Soon thereafter, the Big Lebowski calls him in and asks him to serve as the courier for a money drop to some guys who kidnapped his pretty young wife Bunny (Tara Reid).  That's when all the trouble really starts.  The Dude's soon mixed up with all sorts of crazy people (including a gang of nihilists), while Walter manages to get him deeper and deeper into a lot of trouble he never wanted in the first place.  There are indeed lots of strands in the Dude's head as the whole story takes a series of odd twists and turns, each of them funnier than the last.  And he's got to get ready for the big semifinals of bowling league play, to boot - Walter is very, very dedicated to the bowling league games.  It's almost impossible to give a good overview of the plot, and I wouldn't want to do so anyway, as you really have to experience it all for yourself.<br /><br />You've got to love the Dude.  He's just a lazy slacker who wanted his good, clean rug back, and then all this crazy stuff happened to him.  Rest easy, though, knowing that "the Dude abides."  Sometimes, that's about all you can do in this crazy world.  I should mention that the film more than earns its R rating for profanity, as about every third word anyone says is a curse word - so if that kind of thing bothers you, you may be "out of your element" here.  I am quite confident, though, that most viewers will laugh themselves silly watching this movie and will want to keep on watching it over and over again.  The Coen Brothers hit a grand slam with this one.</p></body></html>

But those clich&eacute;s of the 1960s....<br /><br />Will it ever end, this never-ending nostalgia trip for the 60s, no matter how old and unoriginal? Only when a lot of people have died.<br /><br />Sir Paul keeps cashing in and hey what's wrong with that(?), but ultimately you might wonder what will be left of his band's mythic status after all the circuses and movies and everything else. But they're making more than ever on Elvis so if it is good enough for the King, it is good enough for the Fab Four, I guess. What a drag it is getting old a guy said, but less so while getting super-rich. And when your 64 even if they don't need you it is nice to still be wanted, even if for only your past.<br /><br />I like the Beatles' music. Or some of it. I don't care for how some songs are done here. I can appreciate fans digging this flick though, so don't pay no mind to my jadded, jilted Gen-X self. I do wonder if John would be down with all these movies and circuses and musicals? You may call me a dreamer, but I doubt it. He always was my favorite. But who knows? He never lived through the clich&eacute;s of the 1980s.</p></body></html>

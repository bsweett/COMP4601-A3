<meta name="summary" content="A riveting backwoods thriller - exploring the limits of family loyalty in the cold mountains of the Ozarks"></head><body><p>Ree has enough to deal with, even before she finds out her house is due to be taken away. She's just seventeen, and stuck running the household, with two younger siblings to feed and a catatonic mother to care for.  "Don't never ask for nothing what ought to be offered" is the motto of this resourceful and proud young woman.  She does a good job, given meager resources - but her father's been away a long time, out on bail for cooking crystal meth, and he put up the house and the land as collateral.  The only thing for it is to find him, and nobody wants to help, and she comes to see that knowing can be dangerous.<br /><br />For a small-scale, low-budget, independent feature, the film looks great: the desolate beauty of the landscapes, the delicate montages of the two innocent and largely unaware siblings engaged in resourceful play, the authentic settings, and the seasonal lighting.  The film as a whole is richly imagined, with strong performances and an unsettling mood.  The story is strong, managing to convey without exposition or voiceover the tension that exists in this region between a rich folk tradition and a stark economic necessity that has driven many of the locals to support themselves through the illegal drug trade, and the tension between familial loyalty and the need for self-preservation.  At times it felt like perhaps the screenplay undercut the realism - it aimed so deliberately at economy of exposition that the characters become something like vernacular poets, implausibly tending to convey a wealth of details with a minimum of words, rather than just being reticent  Still, the sense of mystery that drives Ree's exploration is sustained throughout, and kept me on the edge of my seat and caring throughout.  This isn't a masterpiece, but is solid storytelling that creates the right atmosphere, and makes the most of limited resources.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence immersed herself thoroughly in character as Ree, and her uncle "Teardrop" was brilliantly played by Tom Hawkes, who always seemed more vulnerable in other roles I've seen him in, such as Deadwood, but he's fierce here, and convinced me as someone you wouldn't want to mess with.  What I found perhaps most fascinating was the characterization of some of the other women in the story, who serve as gatekeepers to the clan leader, Floyd.  They seemed at first heartlessly vicious, but it struck me later they didn't like to be violent and saw their brutality as a kind of kindness, intended to protect.  A powerful film, that stands up well to similarly powerful films about surprisingly strong individuals facing impossible circumstances in the midst of destitution, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027EU2S2">Trouble the Water</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R4T3K">Undertow</a>.</p></body></html>

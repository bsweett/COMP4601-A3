That said, star Jason Statham as Frank Martin has lost none of his charismatic appeal from the first film.  He still amazes with his physicality in the action sequences.  It should be noted that the director of the original film, Cory Yuen, choreographed these scenes.  Terrific vehicular scenes most notably one where Frank pursues a bus with a speedboat and another where he dislodges a bomb from the bottom of his car with a crane.  Popcorn entertainment at it's best.  I can't wait for the next installment.</p></body></html>

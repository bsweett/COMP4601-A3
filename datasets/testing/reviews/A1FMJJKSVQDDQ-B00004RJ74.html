<meta name="summary" content=""All right . . . let's go kill some f***ing vampires!""></head><body><p>If you're sick of all this Twilight phenomenon that's still occurring as of today, and are looking for different and far more bad@** vampires, then you've made the right decision by finding the movie From Dusk Till Dawn here on Amazon. In this film, we not only see vampires and blood, but also some awesome action and some very dark humor. The first half of the film is basically an action adventure with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino. The second half is where the bigger mayhem is found: vampires, guns, gore, explosions, etc. And it all happens in a strip club: can it get any stranger than that? Everyone does an extraordinary job here: Clooney and Tarantino as the main protagonist; Keitel, Lewis, and Liu as supporting characters; Hayek as the sexy Satanico Pandemonium; Marin as comic relief; the direction, the music, the editing, the cinematography, everything is done with flair and verve. So forget Twilight and its "sparkly" vampires that only teenage girls will love; From Dusk Till Dawn is a real treat if you're into REAL awesome vampires.</p></body></html>

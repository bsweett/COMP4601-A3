<meta name="summary" content="Best Efforts From Howard, Crowe, and Giamatti...WOW"></head><body><p>I predict Cinderella Man will get at least 5 Oscar nominations (Actor-Crowe and Supporting Actor-Giamatti are the obvious nominations) and it deserves it. Ron Howard is at the top of his game here, properly balancing the depression/family scenes and long grueling bouts in the ring. I would even say that this is my favorite film of his. Russell Crowe turns in another great performance (when does he not?) and has earned the spot as one our most gifted actors along side Johnny Depp. On par with Crowe in the performance department is the wonderful Paul Giamatti. I respected him as a hard working actor, but I wasn't a big fan until I saw him in this film. He plays the manager of Jim Braddock (Crowe) and the relationship between the two is so believable, not to mention he adds the right amount of comic relief. Renee Zellweger is someone who I am usaully not fond of, but she manages pretty good here. She is the weakest performance by far, but fits into the movie nicely. If you don't like boxing, you will still love the drama Cinderella Man has to offer. But if you are a big boxing fan like myself, you will never see more realistic fight scenes that run for minutes & minutes on end in any other film (Rocky doesn't count in the realistic department). I'm really surprised this film only garnered a PG-13 rating, with brutal fights on the level of Raging Bull. Finally, it is nice to see a prize fighter depicted as the nice guy Braddock was. Times were tough, but Jim Braddock's spirit and determination were far tougher.</p></body></html>

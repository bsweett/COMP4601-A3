<meta name="summary" content="The First Commercial Movie Filmed Inside the United Nations Building."></head><body><p>"The Interpreter" has the distinction of being the first commercial movie to be filmed inside the United Nations building in New York City. The UN Charter prohibits commercial use of the building, but director Sydney Pollack was able to get permission to film from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on the grounds that the film's themes support the UN mission. It helps that "The Interpreter" was able to film on location inside the UN, as that building's huge open spaces and natural light improve the film's aesthetics considerably and would have been impossible to recreate. The premise is that Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), a simultaneous interpreter at the UN, overhears a conversation about an attempt on the life of Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), President of the fictional African nation of Matobo, who is scheduled to give a speech before the General Assembly. Secret Service Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) of the Dignitary Protection Squad, and his partner Agent Woods (Catherine Keener), are assigned to protect Zuwanie and to investigate Silvia's claim. Even when it becomes clear that her life is threatened, Silvia's politics concerning Zuwanie and her involvement in the drama are still suspect.<br /><br />Silvia Broome and Tobin Keller are not what I'd call well-written characters, but Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn give them more weight than lesser actors would. Silvia has a bizarre, unidentifiable accent. The character has one British and one white African parent. A South African accent would seem appropriate, but that's not what she has. The Matoban language "Ku", which Silvia translates, was created for the film at the South African Language Institute in London. It is a cross between Swahili, commonly spoken in East Africa, and Shona, a language of Southwestern Africa. "The Interpreter" is a suspense/thriller, so what the characters and audience don't know is what makes it work. Edmond Zuwanie's enemies may want him dead, but his supporters also want to prevent his speech at the UN, so it's anybody's guess which camp the assassin might come from. Silvia Broome is far from disinterested in the politics of Matobo, her home nation, but is she acting on her interests or her ideals? Those are the questions that keep everyone guessing. "The Interpreter" isn't a great thriller. It didn't have a script -or rather, the script was written as they were shooting, and it shows. But if you're looking for a reasonably entertaining film featuring talented stars, "The Interpreter" fills the bill. 3 ? stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2005): Bonus features include a less probable Alternate Ending (3 minutes), 3 deleted scenes (2 minutes), 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In "Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room" (10 minutes), the director talks about what he likes about directing, the challenges of filmmaking, and shooting this film without a script. "Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen" (5 minutes) is Pollack's explanation of why he objects to pan and scan. "The Interpreter" is the first film Pollack has shot in wide screen in a long time, as he felt compelled to shoot in full screen format because his movies were being panned and scanned for television and video. "The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations" (8 minutes) talks about shooting inside the UN building. "A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters" (8 minutes) is an interesting look at the challenges of simultaneous interpretation, explained by Diana Liao, Chief of the Interpretation Service at the UN, and Brigitte Andreassier-Pearl, Chief of the French section of the Interpretation Service at the UN. The audio commentary by director Sydney Pollack is sporadic, with long lulls, but it is interesting. Pollack discusses the intention of the scenes on which he comments, what he added after shooting and took out in editing and why, story, locations, and some technical challenges. Subtitles are available for the film in Spanish and French. Captions are available in English. Dubbing is available in French.</p></body></html>

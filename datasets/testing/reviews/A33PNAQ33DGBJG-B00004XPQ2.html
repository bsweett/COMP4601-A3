<meta name="summary" content="The bridge..."></head><body><p>An excellent movie. It gives all aspects of the war;those who are gung-ho,those that didn't care for the war, the captured, the japanese,and those tortured. It is a movie that makes you think and just be entertained. I can recommend this movie for everyone. There is a bit of violence but it is done with taste.<br /><br />Ps.There is a book called Ship of Ghosts. It is the true story of this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Comedy classic superb on blu ray"></head><body><p>OFFICE SPACE is a film from 1999 believe it or not but it is from the comedy legend Mike Judge.  Written and directed by Judge with wit, realism and spot on observations this film about the everyday work place truly stands the test of time.  It inded deserves the cult following it has acquired and reigns in a class all its own as it satirizes the American worker so perfectly.  The story has a purpose but also provides laughs from beginning to end that often turn into side splitting belly laughs.  The entire cast is excellent with Ron Livingston, Stephen Root and Gary Cole in particular reigning supreme.  Livingston shines and makes the whole story line seem very plausible and helps the viewer care for all the characters.  And it is so much fun to see an early Jennifer Anniston and you will never forget her dealing with her flair after this film.<br /><br />Blu ray is indeed a magic worker and this film looks excellent on blu ray.  The video is crisp, clear, bright with colors that pop and realistic flesh tones.  Black/white ratio is superb and it is the added clarity that tuly brings this film to a new dimension.  The audio is also excellent.  This is a dialogue driven film and it is always crisp and clear.  When music is present it comes out of the surround speakers pefectly never overshadowing the dialogue.  The entire film comes to new life on blu ray.  If you love this film and own the dvd double dipping for the blu ray is a must.  The viewing experience is truly superior to the dvd.  And if you are an OFFICE SPACE virgin the excellent blu ray at this great price makes it a no brainer.  Its story and humor truly stand the test of time.  Highly recommend.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elvis vs. The Mummy"></head><body><p>Man, what a great flick this is. It's so refreshing to see a good movie these days that keeps you interested from start to finish and is also a horror movie that doesnt involve snot nosed teenager's from todays "flavour of the month" catagories.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />This movie is about Elvis Presley. And yes, it is present day! What's happend is back in the 70's, Elvis was fed up with his life, he had lost his wife, didnt see his kid much and it depressed him that his fame was so big yet he felt so small. So he goes and meet's with the best Elvis impersinator in America and offers to switch lives with him. They sign a contract that if Elvis ever wanted to be Elvis again, they other guy would have to switch. But 2 things go wrong, 1 Elvis (real one) accidently burns his contract in a BBQ accident! And the fake one ended up having a heart attack and thats the story everyone knows.<br /><br />Now, Elvis is living in a retirment home in Texas. He just so happens to share the same retirment home that the Loan Ranger and JFK, both in there geratric years. Whats even funnier is JFK is now a black man (Ossie Davis)! (see the movie for his excuse why, it's hillarious)<br /><br />If that part of the story hasnt intreaged you enough, then get aload of the plot.<br /><br />Elvis and JFK are on the case to put an end to a soul stealing mummy originaly from Egypt who walks the halls at night looking for souls to keep him around. Also side stories like Elvis personal problem and how no one beleives he's Elvis is funny as hell.<br /><br />This movie is top notch... It's got comedy, dark comedy, and it's got as weird plot but at the same time histerical and entertaining all the way.</p></body></html>

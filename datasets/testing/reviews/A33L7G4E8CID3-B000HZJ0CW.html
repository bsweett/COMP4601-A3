The opening tone of the movie is perfect: Troi and Riker getting hitched (finally); Worf, Data and Picard off on an expedition to find the source of anomalous Data-like signatures; unrest on Romulus. Well and good. Unfortunately, the movie begins to hit the skids there. The story, written by John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator), is off his characteristically high standards. Logan has proven himself able to find the personal amid the epic, and Star Trek is often both, so he might seem an ideal candidate to pen this installment. However, this tone of this movie is too dour and too dark for most people to truly find enjoyable. This, I suspect, is more a direction problem than a screenplay problem (more on that in a minute), so I'll give Logan a pass. But you're on watch, Mr. Logan. The dialogue here is at its least memorable for Trek, all utilitarian, and although it mostly avoids cliche, it doesn't ever sparkle. There's no "the line must be drawn here" speech, sadly. There's an "I would be this guy if I grew up like he did" speech, in fact, there are quite a few of them. Cheer up, Jean-Luc, you'd probably have turned out like Idi Amin if you'd grown up like him. On an unrelated topic, I think Picard would have made a smashing dictator: imagine a planet full of bald, Shakespeare-quoting English-accented Frenchmen. Picardia. Rick Berman, give me a call.<br /><br />This movie tries so hard to be the Next Generation crew's Wrath of Khan, with the obsessed, delusional villain, an outmatched and outgunned Enterprise, and a crew member's sacrifice. All that's missing is the heart. And a great deal of substance. Like Wrath of Khan, an outsider was brought in to direct this movie. Unfortunately, the outsider for Nemesis was Eurotrip and U.S. Marshals auteur Stewart Baird instead of the multitalented Nicholas Meyer. THE Nicholas Meyer (hereafter referred to as Saint Nick) had never directed a film before Wrath of Khan, but his outing in Khan was more than luck: this guy knew what he was doing. He managed to coax an entirely ham-free performance out of William Shatner, no small feat (and I love Bill Shatner, so don't scream at me). Khan was a seriously messed-up guy, but Ricardo Montalban played him with such magnetism and charisma you couldn't help but love the guy, at the very least love to hate him. Wrath of Khan was perfectly paced, technically marvelous, and full of touching (but not manipulative) moments. Saint Nick also co-wrote the screenplay for Star Trek IV and co-wrote and directed Star Trek VI, all the original series favorites. His resume speaks for itself. Let's look at Stewart Baird's resume. A quarter-remembered action flick from eight years ago, a raunchy teen sex comedy (coming in rated and unrated versions speaks for itself), and his magnum opus, Executive Decision, an inferior Air Force One copy. As a result of his action background, this movie often feels like a standard-issue thriller instead of a Trek film, with precious little thought and introspection in order to keep the action a-comin', and what thought there is becomes tiresome really quickly. In all fairness, the action is good, as are the special effects. But who cares? The story sucks. It is misdirected up the wazoo.  When it started, The Original Series had the most talented writing staff on television, and it had to: the shoestring effects were nothing special, and the budget was as empty as Scott Bakula's chair is now on Enterprise's bridge (cold, yes, but true). Well, Scotty B, it's time for a big Quantum Leap--to conventions! Okay, I'll stop, but I'll ask this question: Since when did the effects become more important than the substance? Why should I spend my hard-earned cash (in this case, my parents' hard-earned cash, because they treated) on a light show with an equally light story? Sadly, it seems, Star Trek is Trek as the producers have learned to play it: safe, unthreatening, but also soulless. Worrying about audience segmentation and profits does not a great movie make. Gene Roddenberry is, I hope, spinning in his grave, because his Star Trek was the other way around. Star Trek needed (and needs) a Deep Space Nine more than it could possibly know: if there is no new blood in the franchise, it will die of inbreeding. How many different alien names can you come up with, really? You're going to run out, eventually. As sad as it makes me feel, Nemesis is the future of Star Trek, not its past.<br /><br />Say what you will about studio execs, but they can connect the dots:  most successful Trek pictures: Wrath of Khan, First Contact. Possible reasons: new directors, tension, excitement, epic action, substance. Lather, rinse, repeat. So, a great movie is a shopping list? If it's so simple, then why do so many movies suck? Apparently, the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy applies here--those factors were present in both films, but they weren't the reason they were great movies. These movies were spectacular because they spoke to timeless themes and gave the actors material to sink their teeth into, but also because they took extraordinary risks and succeeded wildly. Kirk is having a midlife crisis? Picard is obsessed with killing the Borg? These were quite bold risks to take with beloved characters decades in the making. Ultimately, for all the sermonizing and speechifying by Picard in this movie, this movie doesn't let him reject the thought that he could be the other guy, or be truly terrified of it. Data dies, but the B4 will probably take his place should another movie be made, and Riker not remembering the tune Data was whistling at Farpoint (Pop Goes the Weasel, by the way) doesn't nearly match the power of Kirk's final scene with his son at the end of Khan.  I would have liked to see what some really talented people could do with Star Trek: Paramount's got money, why not get great people to do this stuff (I fantasize about Aaron Sorkin writing a Trek movie), instead of second-rate action directors with portfolios consisting of fare that one sees during the summer, finds the ticket stub six months later in a coat pocket and can't remember the movie at all. Get Saint Nick Meyer on line one, Rick. You need him more than you know.</p></body></html>

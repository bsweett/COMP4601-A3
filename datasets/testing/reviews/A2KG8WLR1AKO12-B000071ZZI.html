<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Identity is among the best of its genre"></head><body><p>Director Doug Liman deserves an academy award nomination for The Bourne Identity.  Alas, it will probably not happen because this stupendous film is not perceived as "serious" by the Hollywood snob elite.  Liman is a master of creating breath taking camera shots.  His talent is similar in this regard to the late Stanley<br />Kubrick.  The choreographed fighting scenes and highlights of Europe compel your rapt attention.  You will not be tempted to move your eyes away from the screen even for a split second. I have no idea if the film version is loyal to Robert Ludlum's novel, but this current interpretation is mind boggling effective and beautifully written.  The only thing required of the viewer is to suspend one's logical faculties.  This is not an intellectual Ipcress File or The Spy who Came in From the Cold.  Think James Bond with a dash of Our Man Flint, and allow yourself to be swept away by super spy and assassin, Jason Bourne.<p>Matt Damon surprisingly succeeds as Bourne in this non stop escapist spy thriller.  He easily steps into the role of a CIA controlled agent who has lost his memory.  Why does he have couple of bullet holes in his back?  The lethal talents remain, but is he a good or evil man?  People are trying to either capture or murder him.  One thing leads to another, and our protagonist finds out that he might be a Jason Bourne who resides in Paris.  He also runs into Marie (Franka Potente) who helps Bourne escape from one especially threatening predicament.  And yes, there is the required chemistry exuded by the two lovers during their adventures together.  We learn that a CIA boss (Chris Cooper) relentlessly pursues Bourne to save his own skin.  Bourne failed to successfully carry out a mission and almost certainly will prove to be an embarrassment, if not even a career destroyer of his bosses.  There is never a dull moment in The Bourne Identify.  The remaining cast selection is near perfect.  Damon's youth virtually guarantees that he will be in many more action films.  Another actor who will compete with Damon for these sort of movie scripts is British actor Clive Owen.  Thus, it is only appropriate that Owen shares a few scenes as Bourne's cohort who is now assigned to eliminate him.  Lastly, I predict that a sequel will be made of The Bourne Identity.  This property will be too hot not to do so.</p></body></html>

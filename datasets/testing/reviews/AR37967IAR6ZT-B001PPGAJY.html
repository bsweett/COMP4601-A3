<meta name="summary" content="One of the best comic book movies ever made, if not the best"></head><body><p>X2, free of the burden X-MEN had of having to introduce all of its giant cast of characters, is a better movie than its predecessor. It takes all of its characters, throws them into a life-or-death plotline that makes sense within the guidelines of the X-Men universe, keeps the action on high throughout and even provides its actors a chance to showcase their individuality.<p>Watching it, it feels like a comic book. Someone's out to take over the world, and chaos seems to put our heroes in some new danger every few minutes. As Wolverine and Magneto, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan once again get some choice lines, and the discrimination-against-mutants parable gets addressed nicely, complete with a mutant "coming out" scene.<p>The final battle is thrilling. The villain is fascinating. Of the major new characters, only Deathstrike doesn't make much of an impression. Pyro is interesting and well-developed, and Nightcrawler's multifaceted and compelling.<p>And the ending is one of the most daring, promising and cool popcorn-movie endings ever committed to film. You half expect the film to flash "To be continued ..." across the screen.<p>X2 is great stuff.</p></body></html>

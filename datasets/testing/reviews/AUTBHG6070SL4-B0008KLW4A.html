<meta name="summary" content="Goofy, safe action movie"></head><body><p>It has Halle Berry displaying a lot of Halle Berry. If you're a fourteen year old boy, or were one, that's probably enough. She doesn't display too much though - mothers of those boys need not worry.<br /><br />The action is strong and bloodless, the minor romantic themes are chaste, and Berry defeats the evil empress of the beauty products empire. (I did say this was a comic book, right?) Some of the "cat" scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, like falling off the shelf.<br /><br />The effects are generally good, and the CGI cats are surprisingly good. It's competent and well made, of its sort, but probably not one for the ages. Well, they don't all have to be. It's a great popcorn movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

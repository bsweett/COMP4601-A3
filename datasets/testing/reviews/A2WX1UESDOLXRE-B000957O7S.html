<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith Rocks This Romantic Comedy"></head><body><p>I knew he could do it. Will Smith is suave and sexy-- of course he can do a romantic comedy. Smith stars as Alex Hitchens, aka Hitch, the date doctor. He helps otherwise helpless guys find true love in only three dates. Hitch won't help just anybody. He's strictly off the radar and can only be found through referral. Hitch's clientel are men who want the real deal, not just a one night stand.<br /><br />The movie centers around Hitch and one of his clients named Albert (played by the hilarious Kevin James). Albert wants to date supermodel Allegra Cole. Hitch thinks this is crazy, but agrees to help, knowing how passionate Albert is about her. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a woman named Sara, who is a gossip columnist. This spells disaster already. Sara doesn't understand what Allegra Cole could possibly see in a dowdy, clutzy guy like Albert. Little does she know that the guy she's been seeing is the famed date doctor.<br /><br />It's a romantic comedy, so it's fairly predictable. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Will Smith is wonderful, come on, you knew he would be. Can't really expect less from Will Smith... we'll just forget about Wild Wild West... Kevin James is so funny; I couldn't believe how many times his Trying-To-Act-Cool-But-Being-A-Total-Clutz routine had me laughing out loud. This is such a fun movie, a great date movie... wow, I'd even say a perfect date movie. Maybe guys can pick up a few tips from Hitch. Then again, are there really any rules?! RECOMMENDED!!!</p></body></html>

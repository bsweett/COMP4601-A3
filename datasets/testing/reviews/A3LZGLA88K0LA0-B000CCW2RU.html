<meta name="summary" content="CLONIN AROUND"></head><body><p>A box office disappointment in its theatrical release, one has to wonder why THE ISLAND didn't catch on.  Certainly director Michael Bay's best film, it has a sleek look, some amazing action sequences and special effects and likeable performances from Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson.  Is it a case of bad word of mouth from critics that halted its ascent?  One doesn't know, but THE ISLAND is entertaining and involving.  Along with its leads, it has some nice support from villainous Sean Bean and although his role is small and underdeveloped, Steve Buscemi is enjoyable as the clones' doomed ally.  It poses the question of just how far a person will go to avoid dying, and how clones could be thought of merely as Products to sell.  At any rate, I enjoyed THE ISLAND and recommend it to those who like their action fast and furious.</p></body></html>

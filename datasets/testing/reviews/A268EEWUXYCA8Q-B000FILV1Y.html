<meta name="summary" content="Funny but utterly flawed"></head><body><p>There are two major problems plaguing this movie.  The first is the same one that hurt Must Love Dogs: the two screenwriters were former TV/Sitcom writers.  There is a huge difference in the humor of sitcoms/TV and movies.  Sitcom humor is good in small dosages, the 30 minutes it usually takes to tell the story and the more popular ones are about witty repartee and conversations about things that are there only to invoke a laugh.  Sitting around, swapping witty lines for the sake of being witty is funny in sitcoms.  In movies, its stupid.  And its a waste of time.  Filler.  So, while there are some very funny scenes, the humor doesn't last the entire picture or help elevate it.<br /><br />The other problem and by the far the largest is the character of Kit and the casting of Zooey Deschanel to play her.  Zooey is an actor who has been resigned to bit parts or sidekicks.  However, in every movie I've seen her in she has stolen each and every scene she's in.  This movie is no exception.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Failure to Launch has an interesting premise: a rather successful, handsome and extreme sportsman guy still lives with his parents.  His parents want him out of the house and to live his own life so they can, apparently, have a naked room among other things.  Enter Sarah Jessica Parker's Paula who has a job (er, what?) that creates a romantic situation for said guy to give him the courage and esteem to leave the family.  Of course, if you watch romantic comedies you know this will involve them falling in love, him finding out, them falling apart yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />In that respect, this movie follows the romantic movie cliches to the "T."  The problem I've already mentioned, Zooey Deschanel, is that her character is much much much more interesting than Sarah and Matthew's.  Kit's story was just so funny, imaginative and interesting that whenever she wasn't on screen, I didn't really care for the movie.  She injects a sitcom character with so much life and energy that I actually developed a pathos for her.  Unfortunately, she's relegated to the sidekick role and doesn't have as much screen time.<br /><br />Failure to Launch isn't as bad as all the critics are saying.  Various "witty" catch-phrases were invented due to the dubious name of the film.  Unfortunately, Failure to Launch isn't terrific.  It relies too much on sitcom style humor and scenes meant for nothing but to elicit that style of laugh and not enough on the actual story and character.  And Zooey's Kit is just too good of a character to be relegated to the sidelines.  For once, I'd like to see a film about that nutty bestfriend/sidekick who has given up on finding someone who gets him or her and is so annoyed with the chirping bird outside the window to try and purchase a gun.</p></body></html>

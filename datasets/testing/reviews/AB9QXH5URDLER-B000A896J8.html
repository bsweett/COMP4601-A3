<meta name="summary" content="3 Cheers for Hollywood"></head><body><p>Take a first rate drama.  Add quality actors and special effects.  Place in a historically accurate setting (especially a setting largely overlooked by modern culture).  Mix in just a dab of Christian, Islamic, and Jewish conflict.  Wrap the whole mixture in a 2 disc package crammed full of educational features, and what do you get?  A 5-star presentation that will be a welcome to many dvd collections!<br /><br />I've waited a long time for this dvd to be released and am not disappointed.</p></body></html>

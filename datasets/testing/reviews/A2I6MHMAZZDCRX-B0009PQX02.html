<meta name="summary" content="The Plot Escapes before the End"></head><body><p>Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) is a top hostage negotiator in Los Angeles.  But when one case ends badly, Jeff retires from the business.  A year later, he's the Sheriff in a small Southern California town where nothing ever happens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about to change.  When three criminals attempt to steal a car, they wind up taking three hostages instead.  Unfortunately, Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak), one of the hostages, has something to hide as well.  Jeff is ready to turn the case over to someone else when his wife and daughter are kidnapped.  Now he has to keep his family alive without compromising the hostages in the house.  Can he do it?<br /><br />This movie is based on a best selling novel.  While I have never read it, I have enjoyed other books by the author.  I've heard his fans are disappointed with this adaptation, and I can understand why.  It starts well, with an interesting premise that really drew me in.  However, the longer the movie went on, the more preposterous it became.  And the ending was much weaker then I wanted it to be.<br /><br />This movie is rated R.  I caught it on TV, so I know parts were cut out.  In fact, it was laughable when the language was removed.  I don't know if any violence hit the cutting room floor, but there was still plenty of it here.  It did get pretty dark and gruesome near the end.  I was expecting this going in, so it didn't bother me.  I'm just pointing out it was there.<br /><br />The movie started out strong, but the ending lets it down big time.  It's disappointing that an interesting premise lost such momentum.</p></body></html>

COME ON YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!?"></head><body><p>First off the fact that this movie got made before an Iron-Man, Thor,Captain American and The Avengers, and the list goes on movies is ridiculous!I thought Daredevil was good, it could have been better,but I was fairly happy with the end result. I bought the director's cut ,but have not gotten around to watching it yet.I have heard it is much better than the original. OK now back to Electra. This movie is boring, stupid, poorly acted and.....do I need to continue? They should have worked on Daredevil 2 instead of this piece of garbage! Unless your a completest Marvel movie nut,avoid this one at all cost!</p></body></html>

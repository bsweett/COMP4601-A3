<meta name="summary" content="Is It Reeves Or Something Else?"></head><body><p>A lot of people are saying that Constantine is wrong because Keanu Reeves is wrong for the part but I see it differently. See I'm no fan of Reeves and I actually think of him as a dry and predictable actor that always acts the same in every film. The stories he gets and his supporting cast is so good that they make him look even better and he gets a high price tag. Constantine needed an actor to play the character as a mean, intimidating, and vicious loner and who better to play that than a man who had that exact role in his previous films.<br /><br /> So I don't see Reeves as a problem but why this film gets such low ratings could either be that it's not true to the comic like other reviewers suspected or it could be because it's not true to the history of the real Constantine. Whatever it may be with those who have the knowledge of the comic or factual history this is a good movie either way. The acting is nothing to be excited about but trust me that the movies perspective on good and evil are interesting enough to keep you entertained over and over again. It's got some scares in it if you scare easily and it may even have your mind twisted around it's concepts longer than you think.</p></body></html>

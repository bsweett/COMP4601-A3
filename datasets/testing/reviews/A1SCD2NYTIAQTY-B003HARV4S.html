<meta name="summary" content="Sepia Surprise"></head><body><p>Although not a movie I would, under normal circumstances, choose to sit down and watch, "The Illusionist" was one that I surprisingly enjoyed a hell of a lot. Filmed in sepia to reflect the early 1900's period that the story is set in, the overall feel and aura of the film was hanutingly excellent.<br /><br />The basic plot is that Edward Abrahamovich, (Eisenheim), and the Sophie, Countess von Techen cannot be together due to differences in family ranking. Eisenheim is not in the "in crowd". He vanishes and years later turns up in Venice, sporting a new name, a new profession and whole lot of cool. With illusions that defy explanation, he causes a stir, especially when he gets up the nose of the Emperor's son, Leopold, who is due to marry the same Countess von Techen from years before. Soon Eisenheim and Sophie are lovers and...well, see the film.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays a very calm and collected, (and quite cool), Eisenheim. Paul Giamatti was a particular surprise, giving a great performance as Leopold's toady, Inspector Uhl. All in all, the movie was very well acted, and all the actors and actresses set this film a cut above average.<br /><br />Although a romance, I thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle that this movie presented. In some ways, it almost drew one into the atmosphere of the film, and you could almost feel the wind of the raven's wings as Eisenheim throws his cloth out over the audience.<br /><br />Setting it in the early 20th century, filming it in sepia, and centering the plot on an illusionist all serve to the make the film a true work of art. Even if you are not a romance movie goer by nature, I would suggest at least giving this one a chance. Both creepy and endearing in feel, it is an intriguing movie.</p></body></html>

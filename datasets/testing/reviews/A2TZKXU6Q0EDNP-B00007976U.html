<meta name="summary" content="Williams' performance doesn't salvage it.."></head><body><p>With &quot;Insomnia&quot; in particular but also with &quot;One hour Photo&quot; R.Williams proves that he's got way more depth as an actor than previously attributed to, in fact that he's been pointlessly trapping himself in &quot;feel good&quot; silly comedies.<br />  In this film, Williams plays the silent, calculating stalker-psycho convincingly but, unfortunately for him, the rest of the script doesn't work with him and the whole film is a rather slow dragging affair that tries to be something but winds up being not much.<br />  But first things first:<br />the plot is  about Sy the &quot;guy who works in the photo shop&quot; who develops an increasingly scary obsession with the family of one of his customers. His empty humdrum life begins to find a meaning as in his fantasies he sees himself belonging...But where he attaches &quot;belonging&quot; is indeed where he doesnt belong into as he pictures himself as a secret uncle of that family.<br /><br />  When he finds out that the husband of that family has turned unfaithful to his wife he decides it's time to take measures.<br />  Predictably, those measures carry the psychotic touches that have been taking over him and the results are...somewhat ugly.<p>  With such a setting (the idea is on its own scary and actually does drive the film automatically in certain points) and with Williams in very convincing form and in a role that seems to be a perfect cast &quot;One hour Photo&quot; should've been gone down as a classic in the genre.<br />  But it doesn't. It doesn't because the rest of the characters are underdeveloped at best, and the pace of the film doesn't keep you envolved enough to bother.<br />  What &quot;One hour Photo&quot; tries to be is indeed a slow paced psychologigal thriller but even as such it simply doesn't cut it.<br /><br />  Most of the time the film becomes intimidating in one's mind because you can easily picture what could happen &quot;if&quot; but in the film itself this &quot;if&quot; hardly takes a horror form.<br />  Basically the one who has failed here is the script writer who loses the reigns in pace and in engagement.<p>  Not a bad choice for a night in and a stash of DVDs to watch but dont expect this film to make scars of terror in your cerebrum...</p></body></html>

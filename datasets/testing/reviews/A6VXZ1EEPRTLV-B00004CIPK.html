Hot off the success of "Predator", director John McTiernan delivered a tight, action packed number that seems shorter than its 2:12 runtime.  Boasting no big stars, Die Hard's success is largely attributable a focused, well paced plot, and the talents of Bruce Willis.<p>As most are aware, the story takes place on Christmas Eve.  NYC cop John McClane (Willis) arrives in LA to meet with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who works downtown in the Nakatomi Plaza.  While the company Christmas party is in progress, a criminal band led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) takes over the building in an elaborate attempt to steal some valuables locked in the company's vault.  McClane evades capture, and proceeds to do whatever he can to thwart the criminal's plans.<p>It's guerilla warfare between McClane and the baddies.  With the barefoot cop slowly improving the odds, picking off a crook or two at a time, during the various encounters.  Gruber the group's leader, played with a mixture of class and menace by Rickman, slowly goes from being in complete control, to struggling to hold things together.  A ruthless and worthy opponent to the very end.  For the isolated McClane, radio communication is used both to establish the confrontational relationship with Gruber, and a bond with sympathetic LA beat cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson).  With a reduced emphasis on dialog, the film's focus turns to the action sequences.  And since the efforts of the law enforcement authorities prove ineffectual, indecisive, and plain stupid, McClane is the only hope.<p>Die Hard's finish is still OK by today's standards, but just barely, as movie finishes continue to rise to more spectacular levels.  The success of this film would result in two sequels (so far) and spawn numerous imitations attempting to replicate its appeal and box office take.  Die Hard is still enjoyable, but not quite cutting edge.</p></body></html>

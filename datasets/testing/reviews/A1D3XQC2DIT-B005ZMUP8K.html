I would not try to dissuade anyone from seeing this movie, but I would add the simple advisement that this falls under the sweeping generalization that the sequel is almost never as good as the original.<br /><br />It always amazes me when a sequel falls short, not just of the expectations of greatness after such a good original film (Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl), but of the level of the first film. I figure they should at least be able to make it as good as the first, if not better.<br /><br />"Black Pearl" was so visually awe-inspiring. The moon-light effects, which should have earned the film an Oscar if not for the Lord of the Rings conspiracy, were vastly superior to the effects in "2." The effects in "2" were basically limited to Davy Jones's crew and those scenes were too dark to appreciate the level of detail. It was as if the mentality was to steal a character from Star Wars, call him Davy Jones and spend all of the time and money making him look real, which they did. It was just not enough to impress me.<br /><br />What worked in "Black Pearl"?<br /><br />Johnny Depp was flawless as the charismatic, smooth-talking Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />What was changed in "2"?<br /><br />Depp was still flawless, but he had much less camera time. He did not have many, if any, chances to talk himself out of anything or others into anything. His logic, though perfect in his own eyes, is a little skewed. This leads to confusion in other characters, and laughs for the audience.<br /><br />They also added too many sweeping panoramic views. Yes, you are filming the Caribbean, we know. And yes, we would all like to go there someday. It is some of the most blatant product placement I have ever seen. I just hope the Caribbean tourism authority paid a pretty penny for those scenes.<br /><br />The movie was 2.5 hours long and in that time, officially, nothing happens. The story goes nowhere. There were many things built in to simply make the movie drag on and on without progressing the plot. Davy Jones grants Captain Jack 3 days to get him 100 souls in exchange for his own, why? So Jack can actually provide him with 100 souls? No, just to add a few extra scenes that are completely inconsequential to the plot, though they make the movie longer. What about the sword fight scene on the mill's water wheel? Did it look cool? Sure, it looked cool. But did it need to go for so long? No, it did not. The fight between Norrington and Will Turner has absolutely nothing to do with the storyline, yet we must endure a drawn-out fencing sequence between them.<br /><br />I understand the lack of closure from the standpoint that "2" and "3" are two parts of the same movie, but I think they left a few too many loose ends. Wait, another comparison to Lord of the Rings? I think they are leaving too much for the third and final installment. There will just be too much to cover. What is the main plot in "3" going to be? Is it to help Jack? Or is it to still rid the sea of Davy Jones? And what about that annoying little British fellow? I'm sure he'll have a hand in the last movie as well...<br /><br />I know I did not take it easy on the movie and you may be having a hard time believing that it is actually worth seeing, but like I said it is entertaining. Especially if you have a longer attention span than I.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention how absolutely amazing Keira Knightley looked? Weird. KeiraJokr. It has a nice ring to it.</p></body></html>

ASBORBING FROM BEGINNING TO END!"></head><body><p>I had not watched this movie since it was released to DVD some years ago,so I decided to watch it again in my home theater. I must say I did not remember this film being this good! It is truely an amazing film that has the viewer running through a gambit of emotions. This movie runs close to 2 1/2 hours, but it moves along quicky. The DVD transfer and extras for the 2 disc set are excellent and worth owning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than I thought it would be. No. Seriously!"></head><body><p>This is the official sequel to the movie Get Shorty. I don't remember seeing it when I was younger, but if it was even a bit popular, I probably just forgot about it. Don't know the premise or anything, but I just finished watching this so I'll get into describing it a bit.<br /><br />This movie at heart, is a comedy. There are over half a dozen scenes that try and get you to laugh. More or less, they succeed. Especially when Cedric The Entertainer beats a wary opponent with the spatula he just used to cook his lovely daughter some pancakes! There were many serious parts to it to which took me by surprise a little.<br /><br />Linda Moon (the beautiful and somewhat talented Christina Milian) plays the tried and true starlet trying to make it in the music business. She has the pipes and she writes her own songs. You can't beat it really! John Travolta's character tries to get her signed to Uma Thurman's label. It takes a while (they find a mixer, try to get Linda's contract away from the "snake" of the movie and some of the plot takes place in between. Some of it mindless, some of it bearable.<br /><br />Anyway, there are many, MANY well-known actors that play in this movie. You probably know them already, but I'm gonna regurgitate the main names:<br /><br />Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Danny Devito, Christina Milian (she's SOOOO pretty) Andre 3000 from Outkast, The Rock from WWF (right? I don't watch that rubbish. It's fake! >_>), Steven Tyler from Aerosmith (Pink is awesome), Cedric The Entertainer and Debi Mazar (whoever she is >_>).<br /><br />This movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, who I know absolutely nothing about. But he helped create a mildly enjoyable film that's half comedy and half drama (I guess, not sure what else to call it!).<br /><br />The white guy trying to be black had his moments, but was probably off-putting to some, hence the low 2.5 star rating the movie has at the moment. I think the movie overall was slightly better than that, but not by much.<br /><br />Some of the music brought back memories (especially the song that was later "sampled" and made into that one song by Mase and others. You know the one! It came out in the mid 90s, I believe).<br /><br />But the rap music in this movie (which there wasn't much of, Thank Goodness), minus the rap song at the end, was a different story; it royally sucked. There was one song where you just kept hearing the "B-word" over and over again, until you were ready to puke. It was very generic (yes, even more pointless than most "rap" you hear on the radio stations these days, and that's saying something. *looks at T-Pain* *pulls his own hair out at the travesty of the thought* I am no rap fan in the slightest and it must be said that the rap songs here were terrible. Mindless isn't descriptive enough.<br /><br />This movie gets 3 stars from me. I can tolerate comedies to a certain point, but that's not all this was and I'm happy things turned out that way! =D<br /><br />My two favorite scenes are first, where John and Uma's characters dance to the Black Eyed Peas song, which is my favorite by them, and is so underrated, Sexy, from their first CD that had Fergie on it, Elephunk. Fergie had a washboard stomach and made a short cameo with the other group members.<br /><br />Half-heartedly recommended.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />John's character was very smooth. People pointed guns at him 2-3 times in the movie, and he managed to talk his way out of the situations all but one time.<br />Christina Milian sings her heart out. I also think that "Believer" was a song she wrote. She also makes for a very charismatic actress. She also sings, "Crazy" with Steven Tyler!<br />It's a comedy that has serious tones to it.<br />The Rock is SO hot in it! But sometimes he overdoes the gay act. >_><br />Mild replayability.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />It's a comedy. >_><br />Most of the rap songs are horrible.<br />Sometimes it's not all that funny.<br />The gay guy gets back stabbed. v_v<br /><br />3 stars.</p></body></html>

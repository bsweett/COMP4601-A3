<meta name="summary" content="Clint Hits One Out of the Park"></head><body><p>This is a miraculous movie.  First, in these times of garish, heartless Hollywood spectacles, it's a miracle this film even got made.<br /><br />Second the film is a miracle in the style, grace, and economy with which it is written, directed, and acted.<br /><br />It is quite simply one of the most moving movies I have ever seen, and I can't disagree with the other reviewer who said this may be the best Hollywood film made since Schindler's List.<br /><br />Though the Oscar rightfully shined on Eastwood as director and Swank and Freeman as actors, I have to give Clint equal credit for his acting here and his music score.  Both are so spare and subtle, yet evoke such empathy and emotion.<br /><br />This film is truly one for the ages, and Eastwood's best film along with Unforgiven.</p></body></html>

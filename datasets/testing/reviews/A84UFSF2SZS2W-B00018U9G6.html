He thinks quickly, acts on his feet-managing to keep the rock band project afloat despite suspicions about his "unorthodox" teaching methods, diverting the principal's attention from his true intentions while preparing his students for a talent show. A good story about coming into your own, accepting who you are, even when the results are not what you expected.</p></body></html>

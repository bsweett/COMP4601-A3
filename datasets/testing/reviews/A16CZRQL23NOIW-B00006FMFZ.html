<meta name="summary" content="Almost perfect gangster film!"></head><body><p>This movie was a punch . Sam Mendes kept every detail ; the art direction is wondeful , the photograph is A.1 , the story is not only very original in this genre , but effective , it doesn`t have any hole . Why did this film din't have a best place in the Academy Awards? Why didn`t Paul Newman win the prize as best support actor?<br /><br />The shot scene under the rain with a veil of expressive silence is a classic!The crudeness is its peak and the tension is of first order but ...<br /><br />The great mistake ; the only hole of this picture is (believe or not) Tom Hanks .<br /><br />Tell me : I have a deep respect for Hanks he`s a good actor undoubtly , but Do you really think he is capable to play a gangster role ? ; he doesn`t have the hard face for that role . And believe me there were another names ; Think in Tom Berenger , Ralph Fienes , Tim Roth , Edawrd Norton , Jean Reno , John Malkovich or Sean Penn for instance to play this character . The story with Hanks is so incredble , so false , because he simply is out of his acting landing .<br /><br />This wrong choice made this film has lost a part of its greatness . If not for that little detail this film had been an instantaneous classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I looked so forward to it ... but"></head><body><p>It is the slowest dullest movie to hit the screens in recent times.  Kidman plays an Interpreter working at the United Nations who overhears an assination plot.  From there the film just goes downhill, and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters. Sean Penn acts like he doesnt really want to be there, and Kidman is unconvincing as the South African.  The other problem with the film is that it goes on for too long!<br /><br />To market the film, they have plasted Sidney Pollack as Director all over it (as if it guarantees a sure-fire hit) and the fact that it was filmed in the United Nations Building.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy the film but found it uninteresting, dull and a big try-hard.  Definitely one viewing is enough.  Can't understand the box office bliss that it got on its opening weekend.  Assume it was because nothing else was on.</p></body></html>

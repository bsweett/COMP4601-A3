<meta name="summary" content="Return of the Prince"></head><body><p>Disney's "Prince Caspian" is a fascinating twist on CS Lewis' original book. While the book has stories-within-stories and loads of info-dumps, the Disney version is more fast-paced and suspenseful. The Pevensie children come into their own (with the exception of Lucy,who is significantly absent for most of the film,becoming an anchoress for Aslan)<br /><br />The film opens with the birth of Caspian's (Ben Barnes) cousin to his tyrannical uncle Miraz,as well as an attempt on his life. Caspian flees into the wilderness, sounding Susan's magical horn. Barnes is convincing as the noble,yet flaky prince (with a soft center) Unfortunately,his faux Spanish accent draws parallels with Inigo Montoya. There's no Andre the Giant or Princess Buttercup.<br /><br />The Pevensie children return to Narnia, finding it a ruin millennia after their departure. Peter (William Moseley) comes into his own as a wise leader, yet he must yield his kingship to Caspian. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) stands out with moral strength and humility. Susan becomes a warrior princess,despite Lewis' distaste for women fighting. In the meantime, Lucy is dreamy,has visions of Aslan,and little else to do.<br /><br />The movie is fast-paced and exciting compared to its predecessor. The soundtrack is stirring. For purists, Disney took some risks. There's a thrilling castle siege, complete with Caspian messing it up because he confronts his aunt and uncle in their bedroom. There's also a "romance" between Caspian and Susan,sealed with a kiss. The Christian allegory is muted. Aslan exists as deus ex machina, serving only to save the plot. Disney also cut out the part where Aslan tells Caspian that the Telmarines are descended from mermaids and pirates.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" doesn't work theologically. It's not true to the book. Still,it's great fun! Let the sounding of Susan's magical horn call you into Narnia!</p></body></html>

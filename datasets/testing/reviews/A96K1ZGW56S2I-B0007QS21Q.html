<meta name="summary" content="I Am"></head><body><p>I, ROBOT is based upon ideas created by Isaac Asimov, the beloved and prolific writer who invented many of the "rules" for writing modern science-fiction. Asimov's book I, ROBOT is the novel that cemented the three laws of robotics: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; 3. A robot must protect its own existence, except where such protection would conflict with the First or Second Law. The movie takes those concepts and one of the main character's from Asimov's novel (Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan) and introduces a story that feels like one of the short stories included in Asimov's I, ROBOT.<br /><br />In the movie, Will Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner. Ever since a freak accident, that the audience is briefly given glimpses of in the opening of the movie, Spooner has had strong misgivings about robots. Even though they are supposed to be incapable of hurting a human, Spooner is convinced that robots are up to no good and he doesn't trust them. His feelings towards the machines are beginning to affect his career. Then, Dr. Lanning, one of the executives of US Robots and a friend of Spooner, is found dead at US Robots headquarters apparently because of a suicide. Spooner doesn't believe that and is convinced it's murder. He begins an investigation which leads to the arrest of a robot for murder. But can a robot kill or is Dr. Lanning's death just a small part of a much more sinister plan?<br /><br />I, ROBOT is an entertaining film. It's fairly well written and contains some great acting which is augmented by the movie's special effects. Also, watch out for a small role by Shia LaBeouf as Farber, a street smart kid that looks up to Spooner. The film doesn't raise as many questions as the novel it is very loosely based upon. However, the movie still raises a few questions about the nature of humanity and the mechanized society in which we are increasingly becoming consumed. Overall, I, ROBOT is a surprisingly good movie.</p></body></html>

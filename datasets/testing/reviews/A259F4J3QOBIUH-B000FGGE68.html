<meta name="summary" content="Milla Jovovich: you gotta love 'er. Or, she'll kick your arse."></head><body><p>Milla Jovovich is another of those actors who inspire me to watch whatever they are in.  She was great in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800195175">The Fifth Element</a>, and everything else I've seen her in; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPUFAQ">Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray</a>].  However this film is not quite as intense as her usual butt kicking flicks.<br /><br />I would not sell my copy, and the cover alone is worth keeping, but I cannot give the film five stars.  I like it, and Milla Jovovich is always sexy but the this is not on par with Resident Evil, etc.  Regardless, you don't see my copy for sale on Amazon.  ;-)</p></body></html>

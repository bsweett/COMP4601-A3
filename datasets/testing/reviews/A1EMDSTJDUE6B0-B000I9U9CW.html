I couldn't quite give it four stars, but it was better than expected.<br /><br />In some ways, the acting was almost too realistic (which makes it more life-like but less likely to win awards). For that, I would give four stars.<br /><br />But, there is a lack of direction. Too many starts that are abruptly halted. On the flip side, it was pleasantly surprising that it ended when it did (i.e., short film) instead of dragging on and on like some competing films.</p></body></html>

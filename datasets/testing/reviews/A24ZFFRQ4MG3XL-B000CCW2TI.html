You want to know who the guy is that is taunting Lisa Reisert (Rachael McAdams), and what he wants.  How did it come to be that he sat next to her on the flight and how does he know about her family and job etc?  He's deliciously creepy.  It's well written and makes you sit on the edge of your seat.  While I'm not some feminist, it was refreshing to watch a movie like this, and not have the main female character scream all the time - but fight back.  There are some great funny lines in here, and overall the storyline itself is good.  It's never the type of movie that will win an Oscar, but for a little bit of escapism, this is great.  You'll enjoy it.</p></body></html>

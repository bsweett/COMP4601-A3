<meta name="summary" content="Eye-popping visuals & interesting social issues."></head><body><p>This is a visual movie to be sure.  Most of the special effects look quite good, some not, but the overall effect is still eye-popping. While some of the science is plausable [it's actually happening already, though at a much slower rate], I can't speak on the more technical quotes in the film.<br /><br />Main characters are developed, most especially that of star Dennis Quaid, while others are considerably less so. But that doesn't deter from it, as the adult actors all do an exceptional job with their parts. This is helped by good writing. Movies like these are usually full of cliches, trite one-liners, and tongue-in-cheek acting, but here it's believable.<br /><br />The film also brings up some interesting social issues, such as fleeing US citizens crashing the southern border into Mexico (usually cut, when on TV) and 'what does each person value most' scenarios.  There's more, but I don't want to spoil it for you. It's all certainly thought provoking.<br /><br />I recommend this film, for it's panoramic visualizations and issues to talk about.<br /><br />**For more environmental information, I recommend the following organizations:<br />Conservation International, Union of Concerned Scientists, EarthWatch, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earch Int'l. and World Meteorological Organization, to start.</p></body></html>

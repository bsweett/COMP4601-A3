<meta name="summary" content="The Best Movie I've Seen This Year So Far!"></head><body><p>Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), a puny Viking boy wants to kill dragons to impress his fellow vikings and to prove he's as tough as one of them. However, he finds that he's more of a dragon trainer than he is a dragon killer when he captures a dragon. His gentle pet dragon teaches Hiccup that his people were wrong about dragons all along. But can Hiccup get the point across to his macho dragon hunting father (Gerald Butler) ?<br /><br />  How to Train Your Dragon is easily one of Dreamworks best. Hell, I think I even enjoyed it more than anything else they have done. The movie is funny, exciting and even some-what moving. The animation is also top notch. The story may be similar to live action dragon films like Dragonheart and Eragon but this movie is much better than both of those films. The story is better executed and the action is more exciting.</p></body></html>

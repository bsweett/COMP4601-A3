<meta name="summary" content="More than worthy remake."></head><body><p>When I read that director Jonathan Demme was remaking "The Manchurian Candidate" with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, my original reaction was to gasp in horror. It seemed practically blasphemous to take a movie as good, as shocking and as original as the Frankenheimer classic and turn it into some "Charade"-into-"Truth About Charlie"-style mess.<br /><br />But I was wrong. "The Manchurian Candidate" is Demme's best film since "The Silence of the Lambs," and this remake still has the power to shock and impress, combining the same old twists with some startling new ones. Knowing the original as well as I do, I was still on the edge of my seat at the end of this one, and I left the theater thoroughly satisfied.<br /><br />Denzel Washington turns the character Bennett Marco into an over-the-edge potential-psycho, making Marco far more colorful than Sinatra did in the original. And that move essentially shifts the main focus of the film from the once-main-character of Raymond Shaw onto Marco, allowing for all sorts of new twists.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, taking on the Angela Lansbury role, also takes the original character into new directions, though she maintains Mrs. Shaw's innate, delicious viciousness.<br /><br />I was in doubt, but the remake has converted me into a believer.</p></body></html>

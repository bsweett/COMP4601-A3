<meta name="summary" content="Good Scenery, Props, Makeup for an Extended Battle Film"></head><body><p>If gore, and dialogue like "aargh" and "oomph", and impossibly far flying arrows, and tense battle scenes of masses of Saxons against a mere few Knights is your cup of tea, then KING ARTHUR is bound to please.<br /><br />Director Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day", "Tears of the Sun") has restudied the King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable legend and found the origins in 5th Century Rome vs Briton occupation. The result is less a visit to the Camelot of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere of the 15th Century than it is a heyday for the violence that conquering Rome imposed on the 'colonies' of its empire.<br /><br />Given the odd transplant, Fuqua has created a film that is over two hours long and is basically a series of seemingly endless fighting on the bloody battlefields of Briton.  The settings are dark yet magnificent (Ireland at its greenest) and the film is carried by the strong performances of Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd (please change that name!) as Lancelot, Keira Knightly as Guinevere, Stellan Skarsgard as Cerdic the evil Saxon, and the famous Knights as played by Joel Edgerton, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson, and Mads Mikkelson (though trying to identify  any of these actors under all the hair and grime is a task!).<br /><br />So it is a battle film and for that genre it is very fine - a good  popcorn movie for the cold nights ahead.  The featurettes on the DVD are not too additive, but the 'alternative ending' shows that Fuqua could have had a tighter film had that been chosen over the sappy one in the released version.

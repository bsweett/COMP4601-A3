The action focuses mainly on the air traffic control towers and the one flight that managed to thwart the intentions of its hijackers.  It is good that the scope was chosen as it is. The movie is focused, but frenetic, a believable presentation of that inconceivable day.  Yet, it doesn't ignore the other aspects of 9/11 either.  Some of the actual people play themselves in the movie, and the actual footage of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon give the movie a poignant presentation.  Furthermore, the events unfold in a way that is plausible and realistic.<br /><br />Why see this movie?  I wonder myself, 'Is it morbid curiosity that brings one to this film?' The answer is simple:  It documents the courage of Tod Beamer and other real heroes that tragic day when America was otherwise blind-sided by a small group of deluded thugs.  9/11 is still unbelievable, and four and a half years later, we need to be reawoken to the consequences of that terrible day.  Nearly everyone is shown with slow reaction time, but their incredulousness is understandable.  (Some of the bureacracy should have taught us many lessons.) The movie honors the people of United flight 93 and puts a set of faces on the tragedy.  "United 93" gives us another chance to grieve, appreciate, and remember.  It also allows us an opportunity to face our worst fears.</p></body></html>

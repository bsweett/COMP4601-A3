For those of you who don't know him as a director, I'm not sure how to classify him. I saw Dark City first which was brilliant and then saw The Crow and couldn't believe that it had come from the same director. (That means that it's bad) Well, now this, and here Mr. Proyas has decided to make an all out insane action movie which is actually fun and worth owning to rewatch the cool action scenes. On top of it, the robots are really cool looking.<br /><br />Anyway, this is about detective Del Spooner played by Will Smith in the near future. In this era, robots are everywhere, used to facilitate everyday life. But Spooner is fishy about them. And when a new shipment of them comes out, he is nervous. But robots can't be bad as that would be breaking their 3 laws. But obviously they're evil and Spponer goes to kick their buts.<br /><br />This movie sadly could have been a fantstic Blade Runnerish movie if it would have been R, and also a suspense movie and not the everyday shootout PG-13 movies. Also, it would have needed a different serious actor. Anyway, it could have been a lot better if they would have made it serious, but t works fine as it is, an explosive blockbuster like every summer movie! But, hey, it works!</p></body></html>

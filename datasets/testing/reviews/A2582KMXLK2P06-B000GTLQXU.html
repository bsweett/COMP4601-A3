They just appeared there and we were expected to care about them surviving the sinking ship.<br /><br />The beginning of the film is supposed to be when we get to know and care about all the main characters, but hardly anything was done to make them worth caring about.  So when they were running towards the top of the ship in an attempt to escape the rising flood, it just wasn't that great.  I DID care about that little boy who almost didn't make it towards the end of the film.  That was a memorable segment.<br /><br />I can't deny the special effects are really good, and watching the movie on DVD is a whole other experience with the incredibly loud sounds of waves crashing against the boat and all sorts of ship destruction, but besides that, the film was pretty average and didn't tell as good a story as it probably should have.</p></body></html>

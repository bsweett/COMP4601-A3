Probably true.<br /><br />When it first came out, I wasn't impressed. Probably three stars at the time. It's probably not been the indictment that Stanley Kubrick intended.<br /><br />Now, on Blu-Ray, I liked it much better. I considered giving it four stars, because it's probably not the action-packed story most people are expecting. But, if you look at what it is, it should be five stars. Consider it more of a documentary, with a light philosophical touch.<br /><br />Every recruit should watch it before applying for USMC. But, they probably already knew that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pirate treasure and kids"></head><body><p>A mixed bunch of kids follow a treasure map to a hidden<br />pirate ship while being chased by a family of forgers.<br />The fat kid and his deformed buddy save the day,<br />but they have to leave without any treasure ( or so it appears).<br />The motivation is saving their homes from greedy developers.<br />The movies is fun, but not really very deep.<br />It seems to be made like a lot of other movies as mindless<br />enterainment,<br />but real pirates and real sunken treasure have been found since then in several places<br />and not by following pirate maps in Spanish either.</p></body></html>

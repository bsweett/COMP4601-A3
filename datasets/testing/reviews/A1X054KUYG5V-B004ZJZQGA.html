<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious film marred by terrible trailer"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />In Bruges is a hilariously-written and acted movie about two incredibly different Irish hitmen hiding out in a Belgian tourist city that's far far better than the previews indicated; with perfect comic performances by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes, this is a very good movie whose ending admittedly wraps things up a tad too neatly but remains very watchable and very good.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good film but there are a few mistakes"></head><body><p>this film has a great story and the film is good,,,but there are a few mistakes if you are a friday fan....<br /><br />flash back friday the 13th part when jason drowned he didnt have a white shrit on but in his dream he did,also they never talked about him being pushed in the lake by kids.<br /><br />flash back friday the 13th part IV:,jason is fighting tommy when tommy puts the blade throgh his left eye and through his head,, from then on he is missing his left eye,,in this one his left eye is back..<br /><br />  flash back friday the 13th part III: he gets an axe in the top left of his mask which leaves a crack down that part of his mask,, in this one it dosent show up,<br /><br />also another reviewer wrote that it just became scared of water in this one which is true he was never scared in water before this one and at the end of this one he doesnt seem that scared either,, also the look of jason which should have been played by kane looks a bit funny,his tall and leathery like.<br /><br />  and there are two kills that are a bit cheap..<br /><br />when they are at the westin hills when the door falls on the guard look close at the blood because it isnt mixed well,<br /><br />and when the stoner gets choped in half look at his bottom half it kinda bounces,,,,<br /><br />  but if you can get past all that stuff its a really good film.. a must see for horror fans.</p></body></html>

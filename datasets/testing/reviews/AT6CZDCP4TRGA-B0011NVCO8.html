However, it really doesn't do anything wrong as a film, and does perform a wonderful public service in showing the reality and depth of corruption and collusion between drug lords and the "system" (=local law enforcement, court/prison system, politicians, business, etc.).  That by itself is a wonderful relief from the usual "good guys vs. bad guys" simplistic dualism that the media usually bombards us with when covering the so-called "war on drugs."  So there is a refreshingly down to earth, let's-be-real-folks sensibility here, not some puerile moral soapbox. The fact that it's based on a true story, despite the inevitable poetic Hollywood embellishments, only makes it that much more powerful.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott has not made a truly bad movie in ages, and here he picks the two best leads out there to carry the film, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, both of whom effortlessly command the viewer's attention in every scene they're in.  The narrative unfolds slowly at first but then quickly gears into a brisk pace (not as brisk as a Scorsese film, but plenty brisk) and together with Scott's trademark mastery of visual framing, made the 2.5 hours' runtime really fly by.  There is actually not that much graphic violence for a movie of this genre, so don't expect a "Scarface" or "New Jack City."<br /><br />There is, God bless, a fair amount of very very yummy eye candy for male viewers (whom I'd imagine are the main audience for this type of movie) through Crowe's luscious ex-wife and especially his SMOKIN' HOT lawyer whom he's boinking on the side, oodles of gorgeous black women especially the ones working in Washington's heroin lab who are not allowed to wear clothes for fear they'd steal the goods, and of course Washington's Puerto Rican wife.  No explicit sex scenes, just plenty of artful nudity by some exquisitely-chosen actresses.<br /><br />The "uncut extended version" of this movie doesn't feel so bloated like many "extended versions" do, plus it has an extended ending that I found pretty cool.</p></body></html>

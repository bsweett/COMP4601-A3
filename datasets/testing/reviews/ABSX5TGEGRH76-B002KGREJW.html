I had seen previews for the film and I thought that it looked good, and when I learned that the producers were holding promotional pre-screenings to get word-of-mouth going, I was very excited.  I went to the theater with high hopes of a quirky road comedy with Steve Carrell, who never fails to make me laugh.  I did have a slight worry in the back of my mind; road comedies tend to be trite and formulaic, but I was relying on the fact that this is an indie film to show me something new.<br /><br />I was not disappointed; in fact, the film was much better than what I was expecting.  Even though I knew the entire story going into the film, the family's journey was the focus of the film, not their destination.  For anyone who doesn't know, Little Miss Sunshine is about a bizarre lower class family from New Mexico.  When Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), the young daughter, wins the local Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant by default, she is entered into the nationals in California.  She and her family pack themselves into an ancient VW bus and take a two day drive west.  Father Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a wannabe motivational speaker who takes his schtick a little too seriously.  He preaches about the difference between "winners" and "losers" and tries to use his routine on his fed-up family.  His inability to actually get an audience is a big factor in keeping his family barely above the poverty line.  His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) is probably the most normal of the group, but she seems to be constantly on the verge of a nervous break-down.  She tries to keep the rest of her wacky family from killing each other, and resorts to smoking (a loser activity by Richard's standards) to relieve the stress.  Olive's brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a kooky Neitche fan who wants to be an Air Force test pilot.  He has taken a vow of silence and claims that he will keep it up until he achieves his goal of becoming a pilot.  He also claims to hate "everyone".  Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin) and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell) also live with the nuclear Hoover family.  Edwin is a heroin-snorting old man who uses profanity-laden speech, loves pornographic magazines, and tends to offer lewd advice to people who don't really want it.  He also is Olive's coreographer.  Frank is a homosexual Proust scholar who tried to kill himself when someone he loved rejected him.<br /><br />If nothing eventful happened to the Hoovers on their trip, their personalities alone would be enough to drive the comedy of the film.  However, crazy things do happen, such as the clutch failing.  This forces them to park uphill in order to have an easier time getting the car going again.  If a hill isn't around, they have to push the car, then jump in while its moving.  Navigational errors, getting pulled over, and an unfortunate encounter with a certain person from Frank's past all factor in to the trip, and many of the events are simultaneously hilarious and sad.  The film's climax at the pageant is amazing because it is both hilarious and creepy.  I don't want to give away why, but suffice to say that I was trying to figure out whether it was ok to laugh at certain things.<br /><br />It's interesting to watch how these different characters react to the situations around them.  Richard has his motivational speaking, Sheryl has her smoking, and Edwin has his drugs.  However, the best person in the family is Olive, who completely embraces everything that happens.  Walking around in huge glasses, a sweatband, and huge headphones, Olive doesn't care that she and her family are odd, she only wants to do LMS, and is the only genuinely happy person in the family.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a great film that I think most people can enjoy.  Even if you claim not to like indie films, Steve Carrell alone is worth the ticket price.  I will say that his performance here is like nothing he's done before, but he is great playing this new kind of character.  Little Miss Sunshine did well at Sundance, and it earned every award it got.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Audio and Video Quality - Very Good Movie"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The 2.35:1 video was excellent.  The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent.<br /><br />I read "Comedy" on the outside package.  I did not find anything funny about this movie.  I would call it a "Suspense".  I thought it started out slow, but turned out to be a very good movie, with a lot of surprises.<br /><br />There were strong British accents in most of the dialog, which I had trouble deciphering at times.</p></body></html>

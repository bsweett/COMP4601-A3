<meta name="summary" content="This Movie in One Word: Fun"></head><body><p>I really had my doubts about this film and by the end I couldn't believe how much fun I had. I, for one, liked all of the monsters on this film. The acting was fantastic; Richard made a great Dracula, Frankenstein's monster was sympathetic and Jackman made a great Van Helsing.<br /><br />I'm one who is confused by all of the negativity of this film. It's a great thrill ride that is just fun to watch. I wouldn't mind it if they made Van Helsing II. It was great.</p></body></html>

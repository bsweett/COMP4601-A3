<meta name="summary" content="Gripping but gory thriller/horror film"></head><body><p>"Saw" is a creepy low budget film with high wattage actors. It promises to deliver tense moments and it does. Several reviewers have stated that it puts up one too many red herrings and, you know, maybe that's true, but frankly I love that stuff - I eat up Agatha Christy-type story lines. And this is somewhat in that vein - just extremely gory.<br /><br />A couple of guys who don't know each other wake up in a disgusting bathroom (I think it's the one that Ewan McGregor went toilet diving in Trainspotting...)chained to the walls. The corpse of someone who blew his own brains out lies between them. They can't free themselves unless one or both of them can saw off his leg using a saw provided by their tormentor (yes, they try it on the chains first to no avail).  Provided with piecemeal clues, the men try to devise a way out of their prison, only to find that if they don't do exactly as their tormentor has stated one of the man's family will be murdered.<br /><br />The cast includes Cary Elwes (Princess Bride and Twister), Danny Glover (do you really need help here?), Monica Potter, and a few unknowns (one of whom wrote the story).<br /><br />The acting is well above par for such a film. The film is sufficiently claustrophobic when it needs to be and expands outside to give us a bit of breathing room only to reel us back in for more.<br /><br />If you have a stomach for some gore and a few really good thrills, check this film out.</p></body></html>

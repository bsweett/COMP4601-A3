<meta name="summary" content="Silly action with entertaining value"></head><body><p>With the success of the original movie, Resident Evil.  I find myself seeing the sequel to it, Resident Evil: Apolcalypse.  With low expectations I found that this movie was silly, filled with action, and didn't have much character development nor a very good atmosphere that usually makes up a great film.  With that said, the movie was still good enough to be enjoyed as an entertaining movie.  With another solid acting job as the hero, Milla has convinced me that she belongs as a bad-ass super-hero.</p></body></html>

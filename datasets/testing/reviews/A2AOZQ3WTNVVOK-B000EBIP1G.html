It was probably inevitable that C.S. Lewis's books about Narnia would eventually become a film.  Fortunately, this version is nicely filmed and the special effects are phenomenal.  Avid fans will likely be disappointed because the film takes a lot of liberties with the plot, but everyone else will find this movie fun to watch.<br /><br />During the bombing of London early in World War II, many families sent their children into the countryside.  This plot device has been used in other movies, including at least one other well-known Disney movie, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks."  This movie focuses on four Pevensie children, Peter, Lucie, Edmund and Susan.  The four children are being boarded with Professor Kirke.  Professor Kirke is reclusive and eccentric.  The children eventually discover an old wardrobe that can lead to another world, a world called Narnia.<br /><br />Once in Narnia the children discover that they are part of a prophecy.  The children also learn much about themselves and develop many positive attributes, including compassion, trust, and responsibility.  Most importantly, they learn the power of love and caring for each other.  The children learn these lessons while helping the creatures of Narnia, including Aslan, their leader.<br /><br />Narnia is a magical place caught in a battle between good, represented by Aslan, and evil, represented by the White Witch, who aspires to be the Queen of Narnia.  The four children represent a change in the balance of power that has lasted for one hundred years.  Though the children have their doubts and fears, they have an opportunity to cast their fears aside and to help an entire world change for the better.<br /><br />I have seen many movies based on books.  The most difficult books to film are those based on fantasy because these stories typically rely as much on the characters as they do on the imagery of the stories.  Unfortunately, many film makers fail to understand the distinction between a good story and special effects.  Fortunately for us, the producer and director of this movie did understand the difference and they created a very enjoyable film to inspire us all.<br /><br />This film does have a fair amount of violence, and some younger children and most pre-school children should probably watch the movie only with a parent present.<br /><br />The DVD has a lot of special features.  The special feature that I enjoyed the most is the pop-up version of the movie.  All sorts of tidbits appear with this feature turned on that expand on C.S. Lewis's life and on the Narnia books.  The only problem with this feature is that there are lengthy periods when there are no pop-ups and I was a bit restless in the wait.<br /><br />"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is a very good adaptation of the first book of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.  The movie does take liberties with the plot and deviates several times from C.S. Lewis's story.  However, the movie does retain the flavor of C.S. Lewis's book and is a worthy addition to the film libraries of most families and those who enjoy a good fantasy film.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

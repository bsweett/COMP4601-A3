Such is the case with "Alexander."  Add to this, the fact that the mostly reviled Oliver Stone is in someway responsible for said film and you've added fuel to the fire, as it were.<br />Stone has never been one to back away from a controversy: some ten years later his "JFK" still brings people to blows and his "Nixon" and "Natural Born Killers" still causes some to spew invective or at least grimace or roll their eyes...or worse.<br />But despite all this, what really matters, what is most important, is what is up there on the screen and what there is up there on the screen in "Alexander" is quite impressive. The production is gorgeous and some scenes literally take your breath away: i.e. the scene in which Alexander (Colin Farrell) is injured in India is one: in a battle between men on horses and men on elephants that has to be seen to be believed, Alexander literally sees red...blood red. And the ten minutes that follow this looks like outtakes from "The Doors": it is psychedelic in the best sense: bright blues and pinks, Stone's interpretation of a soul's journey to heaven is breathtaking in its primitive yet evocative way.<br />Some 40 years ago we had what is arguably thought of as the best of the Biblical epics: Anthony Mann's "The Fall of the Roman Empire," but though this film is still impressive, "Alexander" manages to eclipse it with it's outrageous use of color, it's intelligent and cogent screenplay and it's frank discussion of Alexander's many and varied sexual encounters.<br />What also sets "Alexander" apart from "Troy" for example is that it is an epic yes, but its scope is played-out on the personal level. And this is particularly important in this kind of film: for often the spectacle too often obfuscates the people...makes them less important than the pageantry and often cluttered, scenery-bound mise en scene.<br />Several scenes in "Alexander" are particularly thoughtful and human: Alexander's scene with his Mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) after his father Philip (Val Kilmer) is murdered and Alexander's scene with Hephaiston (Jared Leto) in which Alexander declares his love. Jolie and Farrell go for the throat in this scene of maternal love laced with ambition, greed and shades of Oepipus. And even though one would have expected that the scenes between Alexander and Hephaiston would have gone the sexual route (at least a kiss), their scenes are chaste yet charged with  palpable sexual heat and tension that speaks more to their love and desire than would any bedroom romp.<br />Colin Farrell is magnetic as Alexander: often over-his-head as King but always human, kind yet aggressive in the affairs of his Kingdom. Farrell plays Alexander as a flawed man, a son of Titans, though sometimes tentative, yet his performance is grounded enough to make us feel for him and his thirst for land and power.<br />In supporting roles Anthony Hopkins as Old Ptolemy, Gary Stretch as Cleitus and particularly Val Kilmer as Philip fill up the screen with their humanity and charisma.<br />But it is Angelina Jolie as Olympias who almost steals the movie away from Farrell. Claiming that the God Zeus is Alexander's real father,her Olympias is part witch, part snake charmer but nonetheless all Mother:  she loves Alexander and with no real power of her own, wants him to become King at any cost. Jolie is so gorgeous in this film that she defies description. Only Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra comes to mind as a contemporary comparison.<br />"Alexander" then is perhaps not a great film but it certainly is a very good one. And it is certainly better than many who have denounced it...most of time without seeing it.<br />That Oliver Stone has decided to do this film at all is laudable. That he has made a film that can stand up to the best of this genre is commendable. That he has made a film that resonates in the mind long after one leaves the theater is something that few films have...and that is Magic.</p></body></html>

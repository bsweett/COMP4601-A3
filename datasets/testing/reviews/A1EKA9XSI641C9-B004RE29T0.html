This film took the basic plot of an alien killing people and made it extremely EXCELLENT.  Not to mention extremely entertaining and scary.  The mood is perfect for the dark ambient atmospheres of the ship.  The "Director's Cut" really isn't a Director's Cut as Ridley Scott says.  Fox just calls it that to sell it, obviously.  They're a greedy machine.  Anyway this is an excellent movie.  Great characters, great acting, great execution.  There's hardly a movie better than this.</p></body></html>

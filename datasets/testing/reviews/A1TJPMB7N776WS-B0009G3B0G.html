<meta name="summary" content="The Prophet"></head><body><p>Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is a man with very, very bad luck: he is shot in the head by a young boy while on duty in Iraq during the Gulf War: hence the great tag line for "The Jacket": I first died when I was 27.<br />Does Jack die again? Or does he die at all? What, if anything is that neverland that exists, or doesn't exist between life and death? Director John Maybury ("Love is the Devil: Study of a Portrait of Francis Bacon") has a tall order to fill, as it were in "The Jacket."  This film doesn't really get going until about midway through when a couple of things happen. First of all the plot starts to make a little sense...i.e. we start to buy into it and you start to realize that Adrien Brody is an exceptionally talented and charismatic actor and you're willing, at that point, to go anywhere he is taking you.<br />Brody, part prophet, part Jesus figure, part Everyman is the key here because without him this film would quickly dive into a bottomless pit of contrivance and you would not suspend your disbelief: which for this film would be a major problem as there are inconsistencies big enough to fill an 18 wheeler.<br />Where there are no problems though, are in the physical production itself: "The Jacket" is gorgeous to look at...the bleached-out color, the jazzy jump editing both add to the overall creepiness of the film in general.<br />Keira Knightley plays her first American here and she is good, in a smudgy, alternative, damaged way as Jackie: a woman with whom Jack meets several times in the film. What's amazing is the hair and makeup people have succeeded in making this quintessential English Rose into Christina Ricci in looks and attitude.<br />"The Jacket" is not perfect by any means but it is ultimately effective and thought provoking. And though Adrien Brody once again plays a character that is more sinned against than sinning he saves the day with his empathetic, beautifully realized and centered performance as Jack Sparks.</p></body></html>

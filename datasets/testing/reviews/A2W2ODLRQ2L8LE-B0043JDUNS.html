<meta name="summary" content="A Set Piece for Iron Man III"></head><body><p>This is an intense action film at points. But at other points there seems to be too much cross-talk between Stark and his CEO (I find her voice to be particularly irritating). While the film has its moments, the producers of the film have a hidden agenda, that is to keep the Iron Man movies as a profitable franchise.<br /><br />Stark comes across as a spoilt brat that wants the world to be at his beck and call. The unit in his chest is slowly killing him and he resorts to recklessness as a solution. I feel that a successful person at that level would have been more mature and responsible.<br /><br />The final battle scene is at night ... again a bit of a let down.<br /><br />In order to set the stage for the next sequel, there are scenes with Samuel Jackson, who is the head of some sort of Justice League group and alludes to his troubles in the south-west. These scenes do not really add any present value to the film but ensures that the franchise will survive.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching"></head><body><p>The Bourne Identity brings to the screen the story of a young man dragged out of the Mediterranean Sea and without a clue as to who he is.  His only lead is a bank account in Zurich.  His problems, however, have only just begun...<br />Matt Damon is amazing in his respective role though the rest of the cast fail to follow with the exception of lovely Julia Stiles who seems to have quite a bit of potential.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good, but nothing extraordinary.<br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

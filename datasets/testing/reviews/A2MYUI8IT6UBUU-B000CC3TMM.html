<meta name="summary" content="Transporter 2 Movie Review from The Massie Twins"></head><body><p>Like many sequels, Transporter 2 does not surpass its predecessor in quality or entertainment value, and actually manages to dumb-down the intelligence level and over-do the already obnoxiously exaggerated action.  If you've heard of films that are "so bad they're good," this second outing in the series might just squeeze its way into that category.  Transporter 2 isn't the worst movie ever made, but it has to be pretty close.<br /><br />Transporter 2 finds everyone's favorite rule-abiding mover of delicate goods, Frank Martin (Jason Statham), filling in as a chauffeur for the son of a powerful government official (Matthew Modine).  When young Jack (Hunter Clary) is kidnapped by a dangerous mercenary-for-hire (Alessandro Gassman), Frank must uncover the nefarious plot behind the crime, rescue the boy, and generally save the day in as outlandish a fashion as possible.<br /><br />For every well-choreographed, creative action sequence, there are five utterly ridiculous ones that truly epitomize absurdity.  An intense duel with a hulking henchman in the confined quarters of a boat make for some unique camerawork and effective combat, and a martial arts-infused fight with a fire hose steals the show for most original and entertaining action sequence.  But a dreadfully dull Tarzan-esque battle with the main villainess, unrealistic bullet dodging, and an anti-climactic airplane crash quickly rescind this action vehicle's license to thrill.  And if the majority of these scenes weren't disappointing enough, they're accompanied by awful one-liners and some of the most pitiful special effects in recent history.<br /><br />The first Transporter movie, while entertaining in its brainless adventure, was wholly unrealistic.  The second one practically redefines the word.  It's difficult to come up with enough adjectives to describe just how detestably over-the-top every aspect of the film becomes, from the abhorrent, lingerie-wearing antagonist Lola (Kate Nauta) to the badgering use of music and skewed sense of plausibility.  Frank retains his use of rules this time out, though the rules of realism have long since been lost.  At least a healthy dose of car chases, massive property destruction, and martial arts mayhem keeps Transporter 2 barely watchable.  Barely.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></body></html>

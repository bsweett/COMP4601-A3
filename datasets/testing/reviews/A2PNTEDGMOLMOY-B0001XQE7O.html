<meta name="summary" content="Grand Tale of a Storyteller"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's "Big Fish" spins a yarn about one of the great yarn-spinners of all time, Ed Bloom, and it does so in the enchanting fashion that makes great story-tellers proud.<br /><br />The present-day Bloom (played by the great Albert Finney) is in the twilight of his life, beset by cancer and soon destined to leave this mortal coil.  According to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Bloom has filled his life with telling fantastic lies embellished with ridiculous fables enhanced by Bloom's own mythical view of himself.  And Will has had enough of it, rejecting his father to work in Paris as a "just the facts" reporter - the duality is obvious:  Dad tells false but interesting tales, while Son writes factual-yet-drab articles.  As Will says, "Dad, you're like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined... you're just as charming, and just as fake." Against his wishes, Will returns home to be with his dad, along with his pregnant wife, during his last days.<br /><br />As various characters interact with the dying Bloom, he continues to relate various tales about his past, which allows Burton to go into full flashback mode.  According to himself, the younger Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor (one of the most likable actors working today), did lead one heck of a fantastic life, replete with witches, giants, werewolves, circus performers, Siamese twins, international intrigue, romances and, of course, a really big fish.  Burton invests each of the various episodes in Bloom's past with a wonderful combination of realism and fantasy.  One thing to remember about people who live in a fantasy world - to them, it's normal, and they tend to act like normal people.  It is refreshing that for all the fantastic things Bloom saw and experienced, none of the characters appear to be too over-the-top or cartoonish.<br /><br />This being a Burton film, also beware his trademark black humor.  If you've seen other Burton films, it should come as no surprise that one character gets his comeuppance by having a heart attack on the john while "reading" a Playboy.  (And what a wonderful comeuppance it is!)<br /><br />Initially, Will refuses to engage his father's tales, and many stories are told to Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard).  But then Will's mom (Jessica Lange) tells Will to start going through all of his father's accumulated personal effects from his long life, and Will starts to see some proof of his father's legendary exploits.  And young Will gradually sees the wisdom in his father's penchant for exaggerating his own legends . . . and one of the movie's best moments comes when Will realizes that he's got a bit of Dad's storytelling ability running through his veins.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, well-written, and well-acted (although one wishes that Jessica Lange had more to do with her role), "Big Fish" is sure to enchant viewers who appreciate a good story, and a heart-felt ending will have more than a few viewers dabbing the corners of their eyes.<br /><br />The DVD has some decent extras, but nothing out of the ordinary (we're not talking about a Peter Jackson 4-DVD pack here).  The pictures and sound are great - a good DVD for a delightful film.</p></body></html>

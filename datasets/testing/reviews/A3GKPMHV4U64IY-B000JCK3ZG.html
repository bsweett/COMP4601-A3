<meta name="summary" content="Endings and Beginnings"></head><body><p>There may currently be a calm, but there is a storm coming.  The conflict between human and mutant is about to heat up.  The spark that will set things off is a new mutant who cancels other mutants.  He has been used to develop a cure to being a mutant.  It is being offered in a voluntary fashion but there are those who believe it will be forced on mutants and Magneto is their leader.  As an added spark, Jean Grey has been found alive.<br /><br />The cure may be offered to volunteers but authorities have developed cure weapons to use against mutants.  The spark has been put to the tinder.  Magneto's Brotherhood wants to rise and eliminate the so-called cure so that it may not be used against unwilling mutants.  Jean Grey has risen as the most powerful of all mutants and she is on Magneto's side.  It is now time for he X-Men to take a stand and defend freedom, liberty, and the cause of mutants.<br /><br />This is an interesting film.  Not only do characters die, but we see new sides to old ones.  Xavier reveals his dark side while Magneto shows his good side.  Jean rises as a force of pure fury.  New mutants become part of the story, some more so than others.  In the end we have the feeling of a trilogy ended but there are also new beginnings and plenty of possibilities for more movies.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Compares somewhat to Wise's superior &quot;Day the Earth...&quot;"></head><body><p>Science fiction fans, as well as film historians, are aware that director Robert Wise had traveled similar interstellar waters with the classic &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. The 1951 film appears on many &quot;best of&quot; lists and coined an alien catch phrase that is forever embedded in popular culture (&quot;Klaatu Barada Nikto&quot;).<p>Some thirty-eight years later, at the helm of Star Trek's first theatrical adventure, the director presented a movie with close ties to the landmark &quot;Day&quot;.<p>Both films feature highly intelligent aliens seeking to better understand the human existence (&quot;Klaatu&quot; and &quot;Mr. Spock&quot;, respectively). Both feature then-state-of-the art special effects. Both have award-winning scores from legendary film composers (Bernard Herrmann from the former and Jerry Goldsmith on the latter). Persis Khambatta and, to a certain extent, Patricia Neal from &quot;Day&quot; are the female &quot;love&quot; interests that provide some stimulation for male characters in the film (Stephen Collins in &quot;ST: TMP&quot; and Michael Rennie/Hugh Marlowe in &quot;Day&quot;).<p>There is little action in both films, though it works to the earlier film's advantage; the protracted &quot;flyovers&quot; in &quot;ST: TMP&quot; - though beautiful to look at - slow the plot significantly.<p>Finally, the two films end on a positive note as to the future of humanity if it follows the warnings given by seemingly omnipotent aliens that could snuff us out in a heartbeat.<p>When looked at from this comparative angle, &quot;Star Trek: the Motion Picture&quot; isn't that bad a flick. It is not the standard by which intelligent sci-fi is measured, as is &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, but it is still a commendable achievement.</p></body></html>

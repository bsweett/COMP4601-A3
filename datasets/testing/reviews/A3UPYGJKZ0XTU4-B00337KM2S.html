Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) flies around the country firing people for a living. He works for an Omaha-based company that is paid by other companies to fire their employees, a business that's booming in the recession. But ambitious young Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) proposes to save the company money and keep the terminators home by creating a system to fire people remotely, via a video link. Ryan balks, and his boss (Jason Bateman) sends him on the road with Natalie so that she might benefit from his experience, which also gives him a chance to hook up with Alex (Vera Farmiga), a fellow vagabond and itinerant lover.<br /><br />In spite of the security measures, oxygen deprivation, bad food, and cramped seating, this guy loves airports and air travel. The airport scenes are the most memorable and will probably be looked upon by future generations of filmgoers as representative of the times. That is where "Up in the Air" is most successful. It smoothly represents an angst peculiar to early 21st-century careerists who criss-cross the country to climb the corporate ladder. It also taps into one of the grim realities of the current economic crisis: high unemployment. George Clooney is charming. It mercifully avoids traditional romantic comedy territory. It wraps up neatly. "Up in the Air" is well-constructed light entertainment that stops short of being appealing.<br /><br />As suave and manipulative as Ryan is, he makes a living by lying to people. Natalie is alternately callous and childish. At some point it occurred to me that all three business travelers are dishonest, hypocritical, and distasteful. It was about the time the film turned preachy, not about the characters' lack of scruple but about Ryan's loner lifestyle, which is trivial. And it is the only thing about Ryan that is appealing. Why would a movie preach against the very thing that keeps us watching? We have a timely milieu, some sharp dialogue, and a trio of distasteful characters in a movie whose message is "everybody needs somebody". It's trite. What begins as an edgy dramedy ends up screaming: "I conform!" It's fun to watch Ryan and Alex one-up each other in one-liners and bedroom antics, but -yikes!- what an insidious, sheepish denouement.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2010): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a teaser trailer (2 min), and theatrical trailer (2 ? min), an audio commentary, and one featurette. "Shadowplay: Before the Story" (2 ? min) is a brief interview with the artists of Shadowplay, a boutique studio that did the opening credits. The audio commentary by director Jason Reitman, cinematographer Eric Steelberg, and First Assistant Director Jason Blumenfeld is constant and informative. Reitman does most of the talking. They discuss the firing scenes, sets, lighting, changes from the book, filming challenges, and other technical stuff. Subtitles are available for the film English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

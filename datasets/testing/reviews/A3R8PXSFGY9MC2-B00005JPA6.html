<meta name="summary" content="Pan's Labyrinth"></head><body><p>Pan's labyrinth is a magical film that will keep you engrossed and delighted the whole way through. The film is set in wartime Spain and is in Spanish with subtitles. The direction is superb and the story kept me gripped the whole time, I didn't check my watch once. It is based around a Spanish regiment fighting the guerrillas and follows the step-daughter of the captain and how she cares for her pregnant mother and immerses herself in fairy tales and magic. It is wonderfully fantastical and just surreal enough to lend it an edge. All the actors play their roles brilliantly and the effects are out of this world. I guess you can tell from my already gushing review that I loved this film. It is different from the usual films churned out these days and I loved every minute. Some scenes are quite graphic in places and the violence can make you wince, but none of it is particularly gratuitous and it all plays a part in the overall story. This is well worth a view, I enjoyed it much more than I anticipated I would and it comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First Blood- The First Rambo Movie-Great Movie."></head><body><p>This movie makes you think, besides the Violence, It makes you think how many Veterans felt when they came back from Vietnam, when All these Hippies and Beatniks and radicals would taunt them and make them feel like murderers, When they were Heroes. Of course Condoning Violence is wrong. But this Movie with the Cops treating The Drifter John Rambo like he was nothing, It is sad, and makes you angry. "He Drew First Blood"- Rambo.<br />Great Action Packed Movie.</p></body></html>

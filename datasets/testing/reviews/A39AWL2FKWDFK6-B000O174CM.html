<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Motown based biopic"></head><body><p>The super hyped "Dreamgirls" a musical based on the evolution of the Detroit Motown sound focusing on a group modeled after The Supremes. absolutely delivers.  The group first called The Dreamettes and later The Dreams was composed of Deena Jones patterned after Diana Ross played by Beyonce Knowles, Lorrell Robinson played by Anika Noni Rose as Mary Wilson and the star of the show Jennifer Hudson playing Effie White, the Florence Ballard role.  The girls were discovered at an amateur talent show by used car salesman Curtis Taylor Jr. played by Jamie Foxx and based on Motown record mogul Berry Gordy Jr.<br /><br />Foxx using a slick rap convinces Danny Glover playing manager Marty Madison whose meal ticket James "Thunder" Early played by a surprisingly good Eddie Murphy is a chitterling circuit R & B legend, to use The Dreamettes as a back up group.  Lead singer, the incredibly talented gospel voiced Hudson leads the group but is promised by Foxx that he's striving to make them headliners.<br /><br />In colloboration with Effie's song writing brother C.C. played by Keith Robinson. Foxx decides that the slim attractive Knowles needs to front the group instead of the full figured Hudson, to cross into the mainstream of pop music.  In this pre-civil rights era R & B suffers also from segregation.  Foxx pushes hard using payola to get his music appreciated and played by the American Bandstand set.<br /><br />Successfully making the transition, the moody and tempermental Hudson is booted from the group without anyone knowing she was pregnant with Foxx's child.  Effie breaks into the soulful heartfelt "And I am Telling You I'm Not Going", a five minute superb vocal performance by Hudson, in response to her banishment.  Years elapse and Deena Jones (Knowles) now married to Foxx, becomes the diva we remember Diana Ross to be.  The story concludes as the group is breaking up as Knowles begins to pursue an acting career.<br /><br />While the some biographical leeway is taken and the dialogue often falls short, the musical numbers both original to the film and from the Broadway production are very impressive.</p></body></html>

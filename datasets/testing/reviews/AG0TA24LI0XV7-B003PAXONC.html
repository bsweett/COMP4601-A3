It is better than what I expected. When I learned that Hollywood was doing a film of my favorite vampire story (the third film version so far based on Richard Matheson's gripping novella), I winced and groaned. They'll ruin it, I thought. Well, the film is not bad. That being said, it's not excellent either.<br /><br />The digital zombies are just that. Digital-looking, if you get my meaning. Why do so many CGI monsters look unrealistic? I can't put my finger on it. Could be skin tones, or a certain lifelessness in the eyes, or the way they move? Hard to pinpoint. But these rabid monsters were cumbersome looking. They were loud and big, but not frightening enough for me. I felt half the time like I was watching a video game. The closeups especially were awful, reminding you that this face was created on a laptop by some guy with orange Cheese Doodle grit all over his fingers. And yet the zombie lab rats (and the zombie dogs in the city) were freaky scary. Go figure.<br /><br />There are some positive things about the movie. Silences instead of musical score accentuate the suspense; particularly in scenes such as when Robert Neville is looking for his dog Sam in some creepy, dark rooms. Incidental music would possibly have taken away from the feeling of dread in sequences like that. I liked the quiet. It was scary and tense.<br /><br />The movie doesn't become too much of a zombie flick; it remains more of a character study involving a man who has passed the edge of sanity but is fighting hard to crawl back. Will Smith is good, as usual. I don't think there's much he couldn't do as an actor.<br /><br />There's very little handheld, 'cinema verite' style camera work, I am happy to report. Lately a few horror movies are copying the visual style of The Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />There will be people who see this film and want to bury it in their back yard or hide it in the freezer along with Bambi, Charlotte's Web, and Old Yeller. I just hope they do not dismiss this film simply because it is realistic and sometimes sad. Those who have seen the movie know what I am referring to. I must confess that I had tears in my eyes at one point. Luckily the scene was handled very discreetly; but any way you do it, it's still heartbreaking.<br /><br />This is a loose interpretation of the book. People looking for a faithful adaptation will be sour after seeing this. After I read the book (many moons ago) I had it in my mind as a movie. It was so involving and scary. There was a scene in the book in which Robert Neville is driving home in the late afternoon and discovers that his wristwatch has stopped, and dusk is fast approaching. I was on the edge of my seat. Would he make it home safely before they came out of their hiding places? Good stuff. This sequence, unfortunately, was foolishly and sadly left out of this film. Heaven knows why. I was hoping it would be included. Hollywood seldom gets it right.<br /><br />Bottom line: the film isn't atrocious. I enjoyed it because I didn't compare it too much to its source material. I would call it more thriller than outright horror.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Double Murder Mystery"></head><body><p>Laura, 1944 film<br /><br />It was a very hot day when Laura Hunt was murdered by a shotgun blast. Mr. Waldo Lydecker was questioned by another detective, Mark MacPherson. Lydecker writes a newspaper column on crime and murders. Laura's aunt is questioned about her payments to Mr. Shelby Carpenter. Lt. MacPherson goes to Laura's apartment, where her murder occurred. Laura came to New York to work in advertising, and tries to get a paid endorsement from Lydecker (how things work). Lydecker changed his mind, and became a promoter of Laura. She now moved in High Society circles. The story tells about the lives of Laura, Waldo, and Shelby. Laura helped Shelby, and Waldo is now jealous. The film shows the attitudes of the people in those days, according to Hollywood. Who bought a bottle of "Black Pony" scotch to Laura's place?<br /><br />The film is slow-paced and talky, like a stage play. There is a shocking surprise while Lt. MacPherson is in Laura's apartment. We learn more about Laura's past activities. The question now is who made a mistake in killing the woman? Shelby tells Lt. MacPherson about what happened Friday night. So all of Laura's friends are invited over for the grand finale, where the detective will interview all the people and solve the crime in a dramatic ending. There is another complication with Laura's behavior. But Lt. MacPherson figures out the likely suspect at the end.<br /><br />This film runs on until the ending that explains it all. I thought this story was implausible.</p></body></html>

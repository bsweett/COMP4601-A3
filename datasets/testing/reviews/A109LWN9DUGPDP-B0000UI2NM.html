To start the gunplay is good but the sound puts it over the top every time a bullet would go off you would here that thump in your speakers alot like a real gunshot other movies (most) have been unable to produce a good bass effect with gunfire this one does it great.Back to the movie O.K. its vampires vs. werewolfs sound cheesy,well thats becouse the two have not been on screen succesfully in a very long time,its pulled off here awsome,with a really great story,great special effects,and characters you actually care for thats rare in this genre of films anymore!With its wopping DD5.1 and good picture quality DVD you cant go wrong I recommend this to many.Also May 25 04 there is a unrated version being released with 12 min.add. footage you may want to rent now and buy the unrated copy May 25 there is a link to it here on amazon.Great film</p></body></html>

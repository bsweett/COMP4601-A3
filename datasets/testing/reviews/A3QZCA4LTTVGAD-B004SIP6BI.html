<meta name="summary" content="A bittersweet tale enhanced by a superb ensemble cast"></head><body><p>&quot;Chocolat&quot; tells a fable-like story of a young single mother (played by Juliette Binoche) who, with her young daughter, drifts into a small French village in the mid-20th century. She sets up a chocolate shop, but her efforts to bring some fun to the repressed villagers bring her into conflict with the town's tyrannical mayor (well played by Alfred Molina).<p>&quot;Chocolat&quot; is beautiful to see and hear. The fanciful sets and the playful score by Rachel Portman enhance the fairy tale atmosphere of the story. Although there are some unsatisfying loose threads in the script, the story as a whole is delightful. And while the film's message--about the importance of tolerance--may be a bit obvious, it's still worth thinking about.<p>Director Lasse Hallstrom showed his skill at handling a large ensemble cast in &quot;the Cider House Rules,&quot; and he does an equally satisfying job here. And what a cast! Juliette Binoche is excellent in the lead role; both elegant and earthy, she is an enthralling screen presence. The great Judi Dench sinks her teeth into a supporting role as a grouchy landlady who has a tender spot for her young grandson. Johnny Depp is charming as Binoche's love interest, and Hugh O'Conor is absolutely delightful as the baby-faced village priest who secretly loves the music of Elvis. <p>To sum up, &quot;Chocolat&quot; is an appealing comedy-drama with some real touches of magic.</p></body></html>

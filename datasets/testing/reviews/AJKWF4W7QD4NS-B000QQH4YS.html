And now, the classic sci-fi/action film gets the proper Special Edition treatment it so richly deserves (the out of print Criterion Collection DVD is actually superior, but good luck finding it).  As far as the movie goes, we all know by now what happens: Peter Weller plays the slain cop turned police cyborg that seeks to avenge his death against the criminals (both street and corporate level) responsible.  The DVD itself features both the R-rated theatrical cut of the film, as well as the "extended" uncut edition of the film (also available on the Criterion DVD) which originally received an X-rating in 1987.  There isn't much difference between both cuts; only a few more seconds of bloody splatter, but it's the features which make this DVD set worth owning.  Featurettes on the making of and history of the film with interviews with director Paul Verhoeven, producer Jon Davison, and stars Weller, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, and more; as well as looks at the special effects, and the Criterion commentary from Verhoeven, Davison, and writer Ed Neumeier.  All in all, this is one DVD that is worth buying over again if you already own the bare bones edition disc, and it's good to see that the film finally gets the mass DVD treatment it so rightfully deserves.</p></body></html>

Not much new character development went into this movie, although a Will Smith type of character would have been much appreciated (and perhaps using the other Quaid brother).<br /><br />There's a plot to overtake the world; this time, it's not the aliens.  The weather is out of control.  It makes for some terrific effects surrounded by some abysmal acting.  How could anyone possibly recommend it?  Well, it has moments of fun.<br /><br />If you have a big, widescreen TV with great dolby digital 5.1 surround sound and liked Independence Day, you should check this one out.  However, if you have just average speakers and a normal sized TV and couldn't stand Independence Day, stay away from this movie...far, far away.</p></body></html>

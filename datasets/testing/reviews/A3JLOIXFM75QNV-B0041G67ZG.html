It seemed believable and plausable, the characters, for the most part felt realistic. The plot was somewhat confusing and overblown though. Its not very suspenseful nor is it very mysterious, but all in all, it wasn't terrible either. Its just one of those films that you can watch, and say OK, and just move on. Its forgettable.</p></body></html>

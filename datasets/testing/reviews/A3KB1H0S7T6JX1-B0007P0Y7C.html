<meta name="summary" content="Lara Croft meets the X-Men"></head><body><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any Daredevil or Elektra comics, games or had had any other contact with the characters apart from the two movies so I cannot compare the characters to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Elektra prior to the film I have to say that the movie was pretty good.<br />Jennifer Garner (who is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for an entertaining movie.  On the negative side, there were several parts that were too predictable/obvious taking away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.<br />In short, the plot, the setting, the special effects, and the music are all good.<br />Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment! 3.5 Stars</p></body></html>

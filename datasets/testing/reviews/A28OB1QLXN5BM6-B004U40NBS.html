To say the least, BLACK SWAN is creepy, disturbing, and very strange.  It tries to be a horror flick on one level, and a psychological thriller on another.  Unfortunately, it fails miserably on both.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, BLACK SWAN is horrific, and, yes, I do understand what the director was trying to do. In many ways, it reminded me of the 1979 film "All That Jazz," a bizarre and intimate look at choreographer Bob Fosse's life and his descent into drugs, sexual escapades, and near death experiences.  As with "All That Jazz," BLACK SWAN plays like an acid trip gone bad...very, very bad.  You are never quite sure what is real, what is hallucination, or what is really going on.<br /><br />BLACK SWAN takes us back stage during a new, re-envisioned production of Swan Lake.  Ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) has snagged the leading role of the White Swan, which is perfect for her delicate and shy personality.  At the same time, she must also play the Black Swan and bring a sexier, wilder personality to life.  The stress of it all is too much for Nina, and she slowly begins to spiral into madness.  By the end she no longer has any idea as to what is real and what is not.<br /><br />The problem is, neither do we.  For the most part, the characterizations are flat and clich&eacute;d.  Natalie Portman whispers throughout the film and is very difficult to understand.  Barbara Hershey is empty and cardboard as her mother trying to live vicariously through her daughter.  The director/choreographer, played by Vincent Cassel, is a stereotypical jerk who will do anything to get the performance he wants.  The shining exception in BLACK SWAN is Mila Kunis as a newcomer to the company who is selected to be Nina's understudy.  She does more acting, and quite good at that, than the rest of the cast combined, including Winona Ryder as the wacked out, aging prima ballerina.<br /><br />Other bright spots in BLACK SWAN include Tchaikovsky's brilliant Swan Lake score, which plays in gorgeous counterpoint to the action on screen, the exquisite dance sequences, and some very impressive and unexpected CGI.  However, these highlights are not enough for me to recommend BLACK SWAN.  And while the ending does leave you gasping, it is not in a good way.  I guess I don't want to be shaking my head at the end of a film.<br /><br />As a side note:  I really don't every need to see an actor or actress pleasuring themselves on screen.  Especially not multiple times.  And especially not Natalie Portman.  TMI.</p></body></html>

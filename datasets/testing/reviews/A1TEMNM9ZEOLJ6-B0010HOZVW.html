<meta name="summary" content="Death Wish meets Spiderwoman"></head><body><p>Why does an intelligent actress like Jody Foster keep churning out these silly blood and gore thrillers? In this one, she takes revenge for the beating death of her fiance by pulling Bernie Goetz-like vigilante killings all over Manhattan while getting closer and closer to the cops as a radio journalist. She acts like some caped crusader, wiping out what she takes as evil. There's even a heavy dose of "Why don't they stop me before I kill again?" silliness going on. Trash, but watchable for a night's light entertainment.</p></body></html>

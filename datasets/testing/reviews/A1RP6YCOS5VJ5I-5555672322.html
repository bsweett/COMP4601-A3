<meta name="summary" content="A Really Cool Movie That Fans Will Enjoy"></head><body><p>This movie has always ranked high as one of my personal favorites in the series. The 3D scenes may look cheesy without 3D, but the story is just as cool as the original. There are many memorable parts of the movie that I have always loved for many years, especially all of the scenes that were about the biker gang. The character Shelly has always been one of my favorite characters in the series because I can sadly relate to the guy a little too much. This is also the movie of which Jason finally gets his mask! So, with everything, this is a really cool movie and a historical one if for no other reason than this is Jason's hockey mask debut!</p></body></html>

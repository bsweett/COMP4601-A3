<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) 96 Hours to Save Your Daughter"></head><body><p>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), the non-nonsense hero of Luc Besson-produced "Taken," is someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Commando" without one-liners. He is a gentle father (and retired special agent) who turns into an invincible war machine that no one can stop. After his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped in the Paris apartment, he flies to France and starts his "investigation" on his own.<br /><br />Using the knowledge and skills he had learned in his former career, he chases every suspicious guy and corners him. To save his daughter, he runs and drives in the Paris streets (sometimes in the wrong side of the road); he beats up and shoots anyone who stands in his way. He's got only 96 hours before it is too late, and as I said before, this Jack Bauer-like former spy is played by Liam Neeson.<br /><br />The 55-year-old Oscar-nominee veteran Liam Neeson, whose previous roles include Michael Collins, Alfred Kinsey and Oskar Schindler, is cast against type as the star of this tense action film. He is surprisingly convincing as a vengeful retired agent trying to rescue his daughter. Well, maybe this is not surprising because Liam Neeson is no stranger to action movies, previously seen in such films as "Darkman" "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" and "Batman Begins." He has worked with Sam Raimi, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan, and this is a quite impressive list.<br /><br />"Taken" wisely focuses on Liam Neeson's character. His charisma grabs your attention immediately, and with his riveting performances, some nice fights and the slick direction from Pierre Morel ("District B13") the film is never boring. Supporting actors, however, are unmemorable or just annoying. Famke Janssen as Kim's mother and Bryan's separated wife only stands and looks worried before the camera. Maggie Grace ("LOST") plays the spoiled daughter Kim, who is so irritating.<br /><br />As far as the major plot holes go, few films can beat "Taken" (the script was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, a writing team for three "Transporter" films). This is a guilty pleasure you can enjoy only by suspending your disbelief. (Some characters seem to believe Bryan, who doesn't even speak a single French word, is a French police detective.) "Taken" is 90 minutes of fast-paced, unapologetic escapism and as such it delivers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exciting, and Denzel is Always Fun to Watch, Story Pretty Far-Fetched Though"></head><body><p>Although this film claims it is 'based on a true story', upon looking it up I discovered the real story was quite a bit tamer - a train did get away, pretty much in the same way it is portrayed here, and it was eventually stopped the same way, but it was going at a MUCH slower pace, and the other dramatic attempted rescues portrayed in the film didn't happen. Which makes sense, because much of the film I just couldn't quite suspend disbelief, and kept rolling my eyes going 'no way!'<br /><br />Putting all that aside though, overall I enjoyed the film, mostly because of Denzel Washington. In my opinion, he is just riveting to watch in almost anything, and I enjoyed him here, even though he doesn't get that much to work with dramatically. What he does get, he spins into gold.<br /><br />The movie is also non-stop excitement - like the train, it never stops moving. So Denzel + non-stop action = 4 stars to me, even if the script and story were less than stellar.</p></body></html>

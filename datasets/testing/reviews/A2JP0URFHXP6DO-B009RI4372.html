<meta name="summary" content="A MOVIE THAT REALLY SCARED ME"></head><body><p>I love horror films but rarely am I truly frightened by one.  This was one of the very rare ones that actually gave me nightmares back in 1981 when I saw it for the first time.  A tour de force of low-budget film making which really shows (for all aspiring filmmakers) that you can make a great film with little money if you have talent.  Sam Raimi has talent.  This tale of five friends who go to stay at a backwoods cabin is truly terrifying.  The cabin is in the middle of nowhere and the cabin itself is a ramshackle mess.<br /><br />The first signs you get of something wrong is when the wooden porch swing moves slightly and then abruptly stops.  The group finds a book (Necronomicon) and tape recorder with a guy doing weird incantations.  Soon Cheryl is guessing the playing cards without seeing them and is promptly possessed by a demonic spirit, taking a pencil and driving it into the ankle of another girl.  They eventually fight her off and lock her in the cellar where she taunts them.  One by one the rest of the friends become possessed except for Ash (Bruce Campbell) and he finds himself fighting off the demons by himself.<br /><br />There are some really creepy scenes such as when Cheryl is sexually assaulted by a tree, and when Ash's girfriend playfully taunts "Were gonna get you...We're gonna get you"  These are shudder inducing scenes!  The blood flows freely and thick as Ash does everything he can to destroy the demon's human bodies.<br /><br />Raimi's cheap but effective gore, and dis-orienting camera work add to the unsettling feeling of the film.  The actors, while all inexperienced and most doing their first film really do a fantastic job, especially Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl.  Raimi is evidently doing a big budget remake of the film set to come out in the next couple of years.  A fantastic horror film and it still packs a punch.</p></body></html>

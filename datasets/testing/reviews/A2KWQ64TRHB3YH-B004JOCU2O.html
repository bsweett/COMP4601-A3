<meta name="summary" content="A non-stop action film with superb acting by Denzel Washington"></head><body><p>This non-stop action film, from beginning to end, is based on true events about a runaway unmanned train. A series of human errors occur because of distractions and overconfidence and the lack of sufficient knowledge about how trains function. These are intensified by rivalries between older and younger generations and family problems. As a result a train is moving unmanned at 70-75 miles an hour, toward Trenton, Pennsylvania, filled with hazardous materials that will, unless stopped or at least slowed down, turn over when it reaches a turn at the town and, like a missile, destroy the town and kill people. The movie depicts the various attempts made to stop the train.</p></body></html>

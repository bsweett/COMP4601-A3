<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly warm and involving -- even for Leo-haters!"></head><body><p>If, like me, you've gotten exhausted by the obsessive focus on Leonardo DiCaprio after &quot;Titanic,&quot; it's easy to forget the reason the public originally knew his name: his acting ability.<p>&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; brings that all back in a rush, and also features the welcome sight of Tom Hanks stretching himself beyond the warm, lovable characters he's most associated with, portraying a character more prickly and difficult to warm to than any since his starring role in &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;<p>Spielberg's film moves along at a brisk pace, feeling very much of the period that it portrays, while reflecting a modern audience's sensibilities. When it needs to move quickly, it does, but he's also not afraid to let the camera linger on his two actors, allowing them to convey without words the deeper painful waters that run beneath their surfaces.<p>Towards the end, the film threatens to wear out its welcome, but on the whole, it ends up being a rewarding experience that is genuinely good for the whole family: Younger viewers will enjoy the caper aspects of the film (although it's no &quot;Sting&quot; or &quot;The Great Train Robbery,&quot; nor does it try to be), while older viewers will enjoy the subtexts of a desire to find a role in the world, and a way to make a mark.<p>Enthusiastically recommended for all audiences.</p></body></html>

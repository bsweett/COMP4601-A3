<meta name="summary" content="A great addition to the cinema of New Jersey...."></head><body><p>Garden State is a prototypical "independent film," and I mean that in a good way.  It has all the ear-marks of an independent film: quirky, funny, odd, off-beat, edgy, innovative.  Writer/director/star Zach Braff is best known as an actor on the wonderful NBC sitcom, Scrubs.  (He brings the same comedic sensibility to this film.)  However, he is an honest-to-goodness filmmaker - he went to film school and everything.  Like Kevin Smith before him, Braff has made a feature film homage to his native state of New Jersey - those of you who don't live here simply wouldn't understand.  He plays an actor/waiter in LA who has to return home for his mother's funeral.  Once there, he goes off his antidepressants and meets Natalie Portman, who gives the best performance of a Jersey Girl I've ever seen.  The movie meanders a bit and is probably better viewed at home, but still it is an impressive debut.  I hope to see more good things from Braff in the future.</p></body></html>

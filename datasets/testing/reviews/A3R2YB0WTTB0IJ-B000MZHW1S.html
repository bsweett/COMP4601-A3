<meta name="summary" content="EDWARD ZWICK, OPUS 8"></head><body><p>** 2006. Directed by Edward Zwick. Five nominations for the Academy awards. A mercenary helps a refugee to meet up with his family in exchange for a very rare pink diamond. Edward Zwick's filmography alternates the best like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WG2F">Legends of the Fall (Special Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005221J">Courage Under Fire</a> and the worst like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V0K">The Siege (Martial Law Edition)</a> or this BLOOD DIAMOND. Besides Leonardo DiCaprio's superb performance, the film is a total disaster. You can't explain Africa's drama in 120 minutes by using Hollywood clich&eacute;s. Either you decide to film an adventure movie in Africa either you shoot a committed film about the exploitation of African soil by western or eastern countries. Too bad Edward Zwick forgot this elemental axiom.</p></body></html>

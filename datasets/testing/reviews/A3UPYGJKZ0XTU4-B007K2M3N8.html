<meta name="summary" content="Musical Biopic Suits Pop Icon Bobby Darin."></head><body><p>"Beyond the Sea" is a musical biopic of Bobby Darin, pop singer of catchy hits like "Splish Splash", "Dream Lover", "Beyond the Sea", and "Mack the Knife", brief movie star, and one of the greatest nightclub entertainers ever. The film was directed by Kevin Spacey, who also plays Darin and does all of his singing and dancing numbers himself. Bobby Darin's story is told through flashbacks, subjective memories, voice-over narration, and by the grown Bobby Darin and his childhood self speaking to one another. "Beyond the Sea" starts off by commenting on its own style, as we see Darin filming a movie that is to be a self-portrait and responding to a reporter who asks if he isn't too old to play himself. At times like those, the film steps out of Darin's life to explain itself, which might seem self-indulgent on Kevin Spacey's part...or it might seem forthright and amusing.<br /><br />We see the genesis of Bobby's musical career when he was sick as a boy. Unable to play outside due to damage from rheumatic fever, young Walden Robert Cassotto (William Ullrich) found solace in music. His mother Polly (Brenda Blethyn), a former vaudevillian, taught him to sing, dance and play the piano, and together they dreamed that Bobby would be a bigger star than Frank Sinatra. As a young man, Bobby (Kevin Spacey) headed to Los Angeles to realize his dream, his manager Steve "Boom Boom" Blauner (John Goodman), brother-in-law Charlie (Bob Hoskins), an inexperienced publicist, and an accompanist in tow. We follow Bobby's rise to fame in the 1950s, his tumultuous marriage to Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), his flagging career in the late 1960s, and the revival of his Vegas nightclub act in the 1970s, until his death in 1973.<br /><br />"Beyond the Sea" doesn't attempt to hide its nonlinear structure, which might rub some viewers the wrong way. But musicals don't conceal their style or attempt to appear literal, so this isn't a stretch. Bobby Darin was a performer, and this film is a performance. Darin's arrangements for his songs have been copied note-for-note. The songs are performed admirably by Spacey and integrated into the narrative in such a way as to advance the story. Spacey is older than Bobby Darin and plays him from ages 20-37 without age-defying make-up. That actually seems appropriate here, since "Beyond the Sea" has adopted the theme of Darin's timelessness, and the film is upfront in telling the audience not to take his age seriously. Both Bobby Darin's and Kevin Spacey's passion for this music come across clearly, as do the crucial facets of Darin's personality and life.<br /><br />The DVD (Artisan Entertainment 2005): Bonus features include a making-of documentary and an audio commentary. "Bobby's World: The Making of Beyond the Sea" (16 minutes) includes interviews with actor/director Kevin Spacey, cast, and creative team, in which Spacey talks about Darin's character, the musical numbers, and everyone talks about filming in freezing Berlin. The audio commentary with Kevin Spacey and producer Andy Paterson is low-key and information-packed. Spacey talks extensively about the film's structure and provides scene-by-scene commentary about filming. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

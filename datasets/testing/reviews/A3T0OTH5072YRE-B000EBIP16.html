<meta name="summary" content="The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe"></head><body><p>The Chronicles of Narnia has been a long standing favorite book series of mine.  So of course I was excited when they decided to do a movie adaptation.  I had a little trepidation as movies are not usually as good as the books, but this one surprised me very much.  It really did justice to the book, and even the scenes that weren't in the book still fit very well into the story.<br /><br />Four children are evacuated to the countryside during World War II.  While there, Lucy, the youngest, stumbles upon a wardrobe that leads her into a different world.  A world named Narnia.  The rest of the children come with her later and learn that they are part of a prophecy.  They will help overthrow the White Witch who has made Narnia into a winter wonderland for the past one hundred years.  With the help of Aslan, the great lion, they will fight the white witch for the hope of Narnia.<br /><br />Characters:<br />William Moseley: Peter Pevensie<br />Anna Popplewell: Susan Pevensie<br />Skandar Keynes: Edmund Pevensie<br />Georgie Henley: Lucy Pevensie<br />Tilda Swinton: Jadis<br />Liam Neeson: Aslan<br />James McAvoy: Mr. Tumnus<br />Ray Winstone: Mr. Beaver<br />Dawn French: Mrs: Beaver<br />Kiran Shah: Ginarrbrik<br />Jim Broadbent: Professor Digory Kirke<br />Elizabeth Hawthorne: Mrs. Macready<br />James Cosmo: Father Christmas<br /><br />I think that all of the characters were well cast in this movie.  I especially liked Georgie as Lucy Pevensie.  She had the right touch of innocence and bravery and really pulled off the part well.  But then again the rest are pretty good too.  Edmund is such a brat at the beginning that I really disliked him.  Mr. Tumnus was just plain cute and sweet and the beavers were also pretty great as well.  The only character I didn't really like was Jadis and that was just because she was more weird than creepy.  But maybe that was the effect they were going for since it was Disney.<br /><br />This movie didn't stray from the book too far.  There were a couple of scenes that weren't in the book, but as said before, I thought they really fit in with the story well.  The special effects were also extremely good.  I had always wondered how they would handle a centaur and a unicorn and they both came out looking extremely realistic. I didn't think the dryads were as good.  I just envisioned a different interpretation for them.  The music is by far one of the best features of the film.  It was just so hauntingly pretty and invoked a "Narnian" sense of wonder through the film.  I especially liked the song that played during the initial train ride.  I don't know its name, but it was beautiful.<br /><br />Great movie adaptation of a great book.  I find it hard to be in any way disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />Review by M.

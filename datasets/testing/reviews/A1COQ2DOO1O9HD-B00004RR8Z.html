<meta name="summary" content="Definitive - a MUST for fans"></head><body><p>Here I go again. Gushing. But I can't help it. This nine disc set is the definitive DVD release for rabid Alien fans like yours truly.<p>I first saw Alien when I was eleven years old, from a projection booth at a drive-in. The sound was on a little speaker, the noise of the two 40's-era projectors a constant drone. The reels were being changed MANUALLY. But none of that mattered: I was sucked into the film so deeply it was like a hallucination.<p>I got that feeling again watching the first disc of this release. The picture and sound definition are so much better than the prior DVD release that it's truly astounding. It makes me wonder just how loose the THX quality "standard" is, since the original DVD was also THX certified. Obviously, the best available elements were used in mastering every film in this edition, and then digitally scrubbed to a high gloss.<p>Everyone reading this knows that only two of the four films are truly great. Numbers 3 and 4 in the "franchise" (I always hated that word applied to films) are problematic. But to a real fan that hardly matters. The Alien mythology, as it has developed over a quarter-century, is somehow larger, more captivating than even the films themselves.  The first Alien, to put it bluntly, was a B-movie wrapped in first-class art direction, cinematography, and performances. Even two questionable sequels can't dim its hold on the imagination.<p>If you're even thinking about buying this, you know the films pretty well. There is no need to go into detail about them. What may tip the scales and make you open your wallet is not only the crisp, detailed transfers, but a staggering (I use that word deliberately) amount of extra material that is intelligently produced and well thought-out. The hours of documentaries are not your usual promotional material; they are real, no-holds-barred inside looks at the making of the films - warts and all. For example, there is no attempt to gloss over the fact that Alien 3 isn't very good, or that the production was mired in meddlesome Groupthink almost from the beginning. Nor did the suits at Fox (to their credit) try to hide any of the legal problems and personal conflicts that plagued the first film (producers Gordon Carrol and Walter Hill thought Dan O'Bannon's script was a stinker - they actually banned him from the screening room during dailies and he had to sue them to get his name on the credits).<p>It's good stuff, all of it. The features on the special-effects are tremendous, with interviews galore - even with original Alien designer H.R. Gieger (who is well-known to be reclusive).<p>The only quibble I have is with Fox's desire to squeeze "special edition" versions out of all four films when only two of them really warranted the attention - the famous (and definitive) Director's Cut of the second film - Aliens - and the fascinating (if not exactly better) first cut of Alien 3, which has some problematic production dialog tracks that never got looped.<p>The first and fourth films were director's cuts as released. Nonetheless, for a die-hard fan, the first Alien's alternate version is definitely worth a look, as it contains the famous "cocoon" scene, as well as some other bits and pieces we've heard about, but never seen integrated with the film.<p>Alien: Resurrection's special edition is not even minimally special, as Jean-Pierre Jeunet is such an efficient director that there just wasn't any material to add, aside from a few trims and a brief scene on Earth. It's not really a bad film; there are some amazing ideas in it. Isolated sequences (like Ripley being carried into the queen's lair) are inspired. But it's marred by some ill-advised "humor" and a hammy performance by Dan Hedaya as a ruthless military commander.<p>Overall, the Alien Quadrilogy (questionable title notwithstanding) is a required purchase for card-carrying Alien devotees, even if they own prior releases. Buy it. Get lost in it. The hours you'll spend in the visionary world of these films (flaws and all), plus the avalanche of supplemental material, will repay the investment many, many times over.</p></body></html>

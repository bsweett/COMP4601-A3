It doesn't look or feel like real desperation. I can't imagine real people arguing this way or shifting moods this way. It's a professorial view of life that feels as if it had been written from an ivory tower, while its author looked down at an expanse of suburbia from an academic distance. All the intriguing details are invisible; only the broad patches of pattern are apparent.<br /><br />So it sees only clich&eacute;. It sees the clich&eacute; that the 1950's were unbearably conformist, with husbands swimming upstream every morning to work like doomed salmon, while wives stayed home in crisp regiments of starched aprons. But if you had looked close and lived through the 50's, you would have found a very different, motley, messy reality.<br /><br />There is also the clich&eacute; of the real estate woman's son. Michael Shannon cast in this role does a very good job as the disturbed, truth-telling iconoclast. But again, his character plays into the trite, almost sitcom presumption that people who are or who have been in insane asylums can be counted on to deliver rude insights and raw wisdom.<br /><br />There's not necessarily meant to be a clear-cut moral to this movie. However, the movie's sympathies are clearly with making a break from the life dealt to you. Director Mendes and the author of the book on which this movie is based both lean in favor of grabbing any chance to climb out of what, to them, is the inevitable rut of the workaday world. The message is that if you don't have the courage and tenacity to launch off somewhere - you'll be trapped and tragic.<br /><br />However, that is the biggest clich&eacute; of all. It overlooks the real detail of beauty inherent in the scene, in favor of the preconceived disdain of 1950's suburbia. If the Wheelers could have opened their eyes, they might have realized they had a gleaming interior, and a view of lovely dappled woods outside, in both a literal and a metaphoric sense. They might have seen that John's co-workers were affable, available beings, probably with rich back-stories of their own. They might have seen that they had a varied network of intelligent, potentially heartfelt people on their very doorstep.<br /><br />I gave this movie three stars instead of something lower because the actors do make a good attempt to elevate their characters to some social importance. However, in the end, I couldn't care about these people, because they would have been incapable of caring about me. They wouldn't even have been able to find me interesting - unless they came upon me somewhere else, in some exotic, glamorous place - such as Paris.</p></body></html>

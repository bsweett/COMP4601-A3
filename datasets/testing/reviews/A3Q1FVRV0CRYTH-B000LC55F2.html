It's dark and mysterious and funny and strange and eerie and disturbing and thought provoking and engaging and unique in everyway possible. From star performances by Christian Bale, High Jackman and Michael Caine as well as titillating eye candy in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo, `The Prestige' enlists an all star cast to help tell the twisted story of two rival magicians bound together by a tragic event that haunts their every action.<br /><br />When Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) accidentally causes the death of Robert Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife Julia (Piper Perabo) not only is their friendship instantly over but they are now rivals, in every aspect of their lives. The film begins with the death of Robert Angier at the supposed hands of Alfred Bordon. As we await the result of the trial we are given, in flashbacks, the events that preceded the murder. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career highpoints here, adding layers upon layers to their characters and giving us, the viewer, every reason in the world to sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of this movie away so I don't want to write too much. This film is utterly brilliant and one that is sure to please. I myself was utterly impressed with every second of this film and am positive that you will be as well. There has been much mention of the twists and turns this film takes and the surprise ending, just note that you may think you know, even I thought I knew, but I really had no idea. Excellent, excellent film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Must See Performance from Daniel Day Lewis"></head><body><p>"There will be Blood" explores the oil boom in early-20th century America via its character profile of oil baron Daniel Plainview portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis. A man who literally dug his first oil strike with his own hands, Plainview becomes a swindler and, eventually, a murderer. He twists the oil out of the land by taking advantage of rural people who are too naive to understand his purposes. He goes head-to-head with rural fundamentalist preacher, Eli Sunday who is one of the few people able to understand Plainview's corruption, but who later falls victim to corporate greed himself. Upton Sinclair wrote the original novel upon which this film is based, "Oil". Daniel Day Lewis embeds himself in the corporate robber baron, Plainview. This is one of the towering performances of the 21st century.<br /><br />A great film with a stunningly inventive musical score -- electronic and mechanical. Set aside 3 hours and see "There Will Be Blood".</p></body></html>

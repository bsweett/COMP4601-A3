<meta name="summary" content="Craven enters new territory gracefully"></head><body><p>I think Wes Craven is a good filmmaker.  However, I would only consider myself a fan of two or three of his films.  Other than A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream, Craven has stuck mostly to cheaper films, that don't scare as well.  Such as Cursed and Vampire in Brooklyn.<br /><br />However, I was still excited to see Red Eye when I found out that Craven was directing.  Also, the teaser trailer that was first shown did an amazing job.  You thought the whole time you were about to see a preview for a romantic comedy, but then the music and look changed and all you were given was the title and some catch phrases, with no plot revelation whatsoever.  From the moment I saw that trailer, I wanted to see Red Eye.<br /><br />The movie itself is very, very good.  Not just plot-wise, either.  This thriller is brilliantly acted, directed, and (most importantly) paced.  Just about anyone can agree that most thrillers are dragged out to around 2 hours or more trying to make the story more in-depth when they are really just boring the viewer (Constant Gardener, anyone?)  Red Eye does no such thing.  At a brisk 80 minutes, Red Eye gets straight to the point and never lets the viewer go once the thrills have started.<br /><br />Basic plot overview: Lisa Reisert is the manager of a luxury hotel in Miami, where a new Homeland Security official is a regular.  On her way back to Miami from Dallas (grandmother's death) she encounters Jackson Rippner at the airport and, after a drink, finds him sitting next to her on the plane.  Once takeoff is over, Jackson reveals himself as a "manager" who wants Lisa to call her hotel and change the official's room number when he arrives at the hotel.<br /><br />What unfolds after that point is a thrilling, entertaining cat-and-mouse between Lisa and Jackson on the plane.  The confined atmosphere of the airplane cabin really adds a good element to the film, as well.  Craven uses mostly close-up, intense shots of the characters, so the viewer can really feel like they are right there, experiencing everything along with Lisa.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams does a good job of playing a vulnerable, but yet strong-willed woman who is not willing to give up control of herself for any reason.  Cillian Murphy plays his second straight awesome villain (after Batman Begins) and does a great job of exuding a calm, inviting presence before the flight, and an intense, professional, brutal personality once he gets down to business.<br /><br />A great psychological thriller with great performances, and a couple of good action sequences near the end, Red Eye makes good viewing for any Friday night.</p></body></html>

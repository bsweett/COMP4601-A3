IT WAS A BRUTAL WAY OF LIFE BACK THEN. INTERESTING THOUGH, NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED. OUR CURRENT CULTURE JUST HAS DIFFERENT AND FREQUENTLY YOUNGER VICTIMS OF HEINOUS ACTS. MAN WILL ALWAYS RATIONALIZE WHAT HE IS DOING. THIS MOVIE IS BLOODY, I MEAN BLOODY AND VIOLENT. TWICE A MAN'S CHEST IS SHOWN BEING CUT OPEN.  THEN, THEY ACTUALLY SHOW THE BEATING HEART REMOVED FROM THE CHEST CAVITY. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. PERSONALLY, I DON'T MIND WATCHING THIS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE IF IT HAS A PURPOSE. I THINK IT DOES SERVE A GREAT PURPOSE IN THIS PARTICULAR MOVIE. YOU COULD NEVER FULLY REALIZE THE HORROR OF THIS CULTURE WITHOUT THE GRAPHIC DEPICTION AS SEEN IN THIS MOVIE. IT MAY BE GIBSON'S BEST PRODUCTION.</p></body></html>

It was the first truly scary film that did not use the time-honored way of frightening filmgoers (eerie music reaching a crescendo, glimpses and/or sounds of the "creature", carefully timed screams, or other devices). There is debate on whether or not it was the precursor of all these Hacker/Slasher films, such as "Friday The 13th", Halloween, etc. I believe it was, because those films did not exist before "Alien" was released.<br /><br />It was also the first Sci-fi/Horror film that had a totally believable and sinister Antagonist. Imagine seeing a species of alien that had more than one incarnation (think of Moths and Butterfies). Each stage of the alien's growth cycle is revealed, showing a predatory penchant for it to progress to the next cycle.<br /><br />Place into the mix, the crew of an interstellar ore refinery, that for all intents and purposes, act like a somewhat dysfunctional family, rather than a group of professionals. All through the film, you find yourself saying (even if it's only to yourself) things like, "No, don't go in THERE!", or "Knucklehead! don't do THAT!!".<br /><br />Even the refinery takes on the trappings of a Haunted House! Nooks and crannies EVERYWHERE! This is made even more painfully obvious with system failures going on, and a general look of disarray. Light and shadow work in this area is remeniscent of the old black and white horror films of the fifties.<br /><br />That a woman was the only survivor after a draining escape and evasion sequence throughout the ship with the creature, is also a first. In the past, it was the Handsome Hero saving some screaming, frightful mouse frozen with fear, but not "Alien". Oh, no! We see Sigourney Weaver transform into a representation of the creature, itself, to survive.<br /><br />There is much to recommend this film, outside of the points outlined above, as a must-see for any true horror film fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A nicely aged wine, I'll take a Pinot..."></head><body><p>As many reviewers have nicely explained before me, this is a story about 2 friends, college roomates freshman year, that take a trip to wine country in california. Miles, an 8th grade english teacher, essentially on the verge of a nervous breakdown is helping his buddy Jack, a b-list advertisement/soap opera actor celebrate his upcoming wedding. Miles is a strugling writer, divorced two years and has trouble comming to terms with the loss. Jack, a womanizing sterotypical hollywood star, wants to get his grove on one last time before the wedding.  As you can see, this combo makes for an interesting weeks adventure. Mix in some fine wine, and let the show begin.<br /><br />I could drag this reveiw on and rehash the story like the reveiwers before me, but I'll spare future readers.  I just watched this movie for about the third time, and each time its like a fine wine, the humor and drama really come out with viewing.  I admit, I have not read the book, but if this movie is even half as good as the book, then the book is definitely a page-turner, one of those addictive ones you read cover to cover in one day.  So I strongly recommend this movie, it really was one of the best films of 2004, for once ebert and ropert were right, and the acadamy awards robbed it from best picture, stolen by million dollar baby, why?  So grab a glass of wine and enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This ain't Hogwarts anymore"></head><body><p>I will say this - the Harry Potter series is getting darker and better as it progresses. I like David Yates' innovative camera angles and pacing - they really do set the mood for the film and make it quite chilling. The animated sequence illustrating the Death Hallows was beautiful. The campsite locations were all exotic and evoked the landscapes of the Lord of the Rings. I was actually surprised that we don't see Hogwarts at all (except for a brief cameo).<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were a few bad influences from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5HRMI">Twilight</a>, particularly a vision of Harry and Hermione making out. These were usually minimal, but still stuck out like a sore thumb. Also, if you haven't read the books, some scenes will seem pointless or extraneous.<br /><br />Probably the best part about this movie was the ending and how it sets up for the grand finale. I won't spoil the ending, but I think Yates chose a perfect spot to split the final book in half.</p></body></html>

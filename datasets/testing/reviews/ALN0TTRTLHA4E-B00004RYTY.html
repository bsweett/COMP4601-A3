<meta name="summary" content="Instant classic"></head><body><p>This is the second film by the director. His first film although interesting was rather static. This film is full of energy and never stops for a minute. <p>The basis of the plot is fairly simple. The heroine's boyfriend has lost a large amount of money belonging to gangsters. Lola has a very short time to get the money or her boyfriend will be killed in an unpleasant way. She has to run from her flat and work out some scheme to raise the cash. <p>The film intertwines a series of different plots and endings which could have arisen from that one scenario. Each is in its own way amusing although some are grim. <p>As Lola desperately searches for ways to raise the cash there is a grinding techno beat soundtrack which pulsates with energy. Lola herself is played by an actress with total charisma and screen prescence. The only slight negative to the film is that one wonders how she could end up with such a jerk. The film also uses animated sequences and still photography and is quite inovative in style. <p>Not only do Lola and her boyfriend face different fates in each scenario but so do the bit players that they meet. One of the more interesting and dynamic films in years.</p></body></html>

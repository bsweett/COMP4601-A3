Frank Castle, played by Thomas Jane, finishes off one last undercover job that inadvertently leads to the death of the son of Howard Saint, played by John Travolta, a crime boss.  Seeking retribution, Saint, and his wife, order the killing of Castle and his family.  Saint's henchmen only complete half the job, and leave Castle for dead.  However, Castle insists he died that day, and the Punisher was born to avenge Castle.<br /><br />This movie has some incredibly good elements, and some elements that are not so good.  It recreates elements of the comic fairly well and it stays within the spirit of the comic admirably.  Some things are changed for the sake of story telling.  In the end, the movie is pretty good, but it could have been a lot better.<br /><br />The best part of the movie in my opinion was Jane's portrayal of Castle/the Punisher.  I was skeptical when I heard he had been chosen.  However, his portrayal of a man that has nothing to lose and little to live for was quite good.  His size and build were appropriate for the role.  His age and physique are not exactly the same as that portrayed by the character in the comic, and die hards may have a gripe there.  Still, as the character was laid out in the movie, Jane was a great choice.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment of the movie was how the director chose to use Travolta in the role of Howard Saint.  Not all of this was the director's fault, as Saint wasn't given that many great lines.  Travolta  has the ability to give characters an edge or to deliver a great line.  That simply didn't exist in this movie.  The character of Saint really had one good scene in which he confronts a henchmen over a possible affair with his wife while telling the story of David Bowie and the Bowie knife.  After that, this villain was just flat.<br /><br />My other gripe with the movie was the action.  Much of it was uninspired.  For instance, in one scene, Saint sends a Russian after Castle.  This Russian is huge and built like a tank.  The fight that ensues in Castle's apartment has a few comedic moments, but otherwise, it just lumbers along.  There is nothing impressive about it from the way it was filmed to the coreography of the fight itself.  This also speaks to much of the direction of the film itself.  Many of the shots were unimaginative.  A veteran director could have done much more with the locations that were chosen for this film.<br /><br />A few of the things I did enjoy included Castle's overall scheme for revenge.  He sets out to turn all the villains against each other.  When he finally confronts Saint in the end, the Punisher fully emerges and lays out what he has done in a dead pan that is perfect for the character.  I also liked the way the Punisher was kept simple.  He didn't have too many gimicks.<br /><br />I liked the movie.  It was much better than the Dulph Lundgren version that preceded it.  Fans of the comic book are likely to be split on how they felt about the movie.  Those that aren't familiar with the comic are likely to not enjoy this movie.  I'd recommend this as a rental.  I hope they do film a sequel and turn it over to a director and producer that can spice it up just a little so that the sequel won't lumber as much as the original did.</p></body></html>

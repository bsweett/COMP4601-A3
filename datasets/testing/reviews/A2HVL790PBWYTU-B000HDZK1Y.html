<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black will make you laugh"></head><body><p>Jack Black is Brother Ignacio, a lowly "friar" toiling mostly as a cook for a dilapidated Mexican monastery that doubles as an orphanage. He harbors a love for the beautiful nun Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) while struggling daily to provide meals for his young charges. One day, after witnessing the adoration heaped on a famous luchador (wrestler), Ignacio hits on the idea of becoming a masked wrestler himself, to gain fame and make ends meet. He elicits the help of a strange street person who has a tendency to scrounge and steal donated tortilla chips (Nacho Libre, get it?) meant for the orphans. Soon, both Ignacio and Esqueleto (as the street person later becomes known in his luchador persona) are "training" to be tag-team wrestlers - if training means pasting cow poo on your face as a luchador mask, leaping into a fenced meadow and being gored by a rampaging bull, being struck by arrows, and having a beehive flung at you. Eventually, Ignacio and Esqueleto compete in the ring, where Ignacio becomes Nacho Libre. They end up doing very poorly but still getting paid, and this becomes a continuing pattern. Nacho Libre soon tires of losing (especially to midgets and women) and wants to go pro. He gets his chance when he finally faces the intimidating Ramses, a champion luchador. Will Nacho realize his dream? And what of his romance with Sister Encarnacion? And will the kids get fed?<br /><br />Omigod, I laughed my head off throughout this film, as did the whole theatre audience. Jack Black sometimes is too much for me to take but in the proper vehicle, the man definitely can shine. Like The School of Rock, Nacho Libre must've been created with Jack Black in mind. He certainly is allowed a huge amount of leeway here. It needed a storyline as physical and outrageous as this one for Jack's ever flamboyant persona to convincingly mesh. Jack's arched eyebrows, Grinch-like expressions, exaggerated poses, and just plain nutty over-the-topness are all put to good use in this rowdy but good-natured film. He even manages to sing two songs, the one about Encarnacion being rendered in particularly Jack Black style.<br /><br />Hector Jimenez as the emaciated Esqueleto, with his girly shriek and just plain-out weird act, is hilarious. Makes me think Esqueleto is what we would've gotten from Johnny Depp if he'd experimented just a bit further with his Cap'n Sparrow role. Black and Jimenez make a potent comedic team.<br /><br />There are some holes in the plot, some wrong choices the director makes. I felt, for instance, that the cliff-climbing for the eagle's egg scene didn't pay off. And also, the unfunny bit where Ignacio and Encarnacion go out on a date, with Ignacio expecting to be waylaid by a "gang." But the constant humor (mostly supplied by Black, and abetted by Jimenez) more or less carries the movie over such minor hiccups. I will say that Jack Black in the wrestling ring isn't as funny as Jack Black out of it.<br /><br />There are specific scenes of goofy hilarity I wish I could mention here but I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Just go see the thing already.</p></body></html>

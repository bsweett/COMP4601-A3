<meta name="summary" content="An Opportunity Lost for Sound Quality But Great Picture Quality on Blu-Ray!"></head><body><p>As a true classic should be, this movie is so good that you actually look forward to viewing it again and again just so you can be sure you didn't miss anything the last time you viewed it. The cast is excellent, the acting sublime, the soundtrack is inspired and the screenplay is also exquisite. Special mention should be made for actors like Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains who are excellent here just as they were in other film classics such as "The Maltese Falcon" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". Although this is not Bogart's best performance (for that you'll need to see "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), he still puts in an excellent performance here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Blu-ray version is a mixed bag especially so for the sound quality which is only slightly better than the dvd release. The volume levels are very soft for some scenes so that you can scarcely hear the dialogue while for others the levels inexplicably increase.  Unlike the great work they did with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020MMRC0">The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray</a>] where they used DTS HD MA for the sound here they used just Dolby Digital which just didn't cut it and so overall is a disappointment and an opportunity lost in doing justice to a great film.<br /><br />After waiting so long for the Blu-Ray release it is an anti-climax that we get this mixed bag release with very good picture but poor sound quality albeit both are better than in the dvd release.</p></body></html>

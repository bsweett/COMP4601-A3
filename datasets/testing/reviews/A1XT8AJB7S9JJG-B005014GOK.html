<meta name="summary" content="Grindhouse leftover, worst movie since Macgruber"></head><body><p>A former Federale (Trejo) who has lost everything has been double crossed and must now fight to stay alive in Robert Rodriguez's latest "Grindhouse" offering.  I will admit going in the only reason I wanted to watch this was because De Niro was in it and it seemed like a strange choice for him.  After sitting through this I decided to send him 5 bucks...he obviously needs the money if this is the kind of work he is taking.  At the risk of losing money and comments I may receive, this movie was lame.  The best explanation I can give is that it's 1 hour and 45 minutes of blood splatters mixed with some nudity.  I like a good mindless flic now and then but this was just bad.  It's hard to comment on the acting, it has an all-star cast including Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Don Johnson, Steven Seagal, Cheech and Lindsay Lohan, but the writing was so bad even De Niro seemed like a B rate actor.  I am sure many of you will absolutely love this movie, but for me it was very lame and the worst movie I've seen since Macgruber.  I give it a D-.</p></body></html>

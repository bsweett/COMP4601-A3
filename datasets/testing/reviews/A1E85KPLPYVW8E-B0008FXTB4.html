At first, it's quite amusing watching Travolta's suave Chili Palmer character interact with white boy hip-hop poser Raji (Vince Vaughn) or with widow turned record label exec Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), as it was very apparent that the actors in this film all had a great time working with each other, especially between Travolta and Thurman who's eagerness and willingness to work together is obviously there (although I`d have to say their big dance scene was a little disappointing). But the problem with Be Cool is that after so long, you become used to this bright chemistry between the actors, and you realize that there really isn't much of a skeletal structure behind this film, and that's it's all flesh.<br /><br />In between the only moderately funny parts in Be Cool, this movie almost kills you with boredom. I mean, there is some pretty funny parts here and there, but it's rather uninteresting story line about a young female singer's rise to the top of stardom and the murderous plot between everyone who wants control the rights to the star seems a little contrived with all the setups and with this person wanting to kill this person or this person owing someone else a lot of money and blah blah blah. The story really tries hard to maintain it's head above water, but somewhere in it's complexity, it just really fails to maintain its audience, dragging the audience and the rest of film down with it like an anchor to the bottom of the ocean.<br /><br />On more of a positive note, there was a part I found especially amusing in this film that happened in the opening scene where Chili is talking about the film industry and how if you want to maintain a PG-13 rating when making a movie, you can only use the F word once. So Travolta lays on a big "F*** that!", exercising his right use the F word in a PG-13 movie. Or how he's always bashing sequels in this movie, when in fact this movie is a sequel (sort of but doesn't really feel like one) to Get Shorty. There's a ton of this self-referential comedy in Be Cool, and I'm a total sucker for self-referentialism.<br /><br />So all in all I would to say this is a pretty boring and uninteresting movie, but it's sense of self-referential comedy and colorful characters just barely make it doable.</p></body></html>

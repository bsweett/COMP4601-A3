<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>All the hype around this movie was just that hype. It is slow paced, without any real suspense and the plot twist that was suppose to be so awesome was very obvious.<br /><br />I was a 'friends' fan and I would like to see Jen Aniston have a sucessful movie career (especially after Brad did her wrong) but she better pick better scripts then this one if she wants longevity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DreamWorks Builds its Masterpiece"></head><body><p>With a review title as ambitious as mine, some justification is definitely in order.  See unlike Pixar (with a little help of the Disney promotion machine), animated hits with the potential to become pop culture icons aren't a given for DreamWorks.  Sure they've had Shrek but ask anyone and you'll discover that 4 feature films and a variety of spin-offs have milked the franchise past its worth.  Kung-Fu Panda came next with signs of brilliance.  Proponents however were quick to point out the fact that marital-arts references simply aren't universal enough (however hilarious) to challenge the clever-ness of your average Pixar piece.<br /><br />Enter How to Train Your Dragon, a 2010 animated work based loosely on a 2003 children's book by Cressida Cowell of the same name.  Coming in at a runtime of 98-minutes, Dragon gained enough critical acclaim to warrant a video game series, a sequel planned for release sometime in the summer of 2013, a Cartoon Network animated weekly series beginning in 2012, plans for a live-tour, and the Blu-ray earning a spot in Samsung's Home 3D Starter Kit.<br /><br />I was vaguely aware of the hype surrounding this one going in, and even so came away absolutely dazzled with the end result.  But before digging into what it is that makes this motion picture a crowning achievement, let's assemble a small summary of the plot, shall we?<br /><br />The story takes place in a mythical Norse world called Berk and follows the exploits of a skinny Viking teenager named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel).  Residing in a land torn by constant threat of brutal dragon invasion, Hiccup finds himself struggling to gain the approval of his gruff father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler).<br /><br />Insisting on entering into battle (to prove his valor), Hiccup ends up using one of his inventions to take down a mysterious and highly feared Night Fury class dragon but is seen by the villagers as only the cause of unnecessary destruction.<br /><br />The next day, after tracking his fallen prey, Hiccup is faced with the fact that he can't bring himself to kill the beast (and hence instantly gain the respect he wants most out of life).<br /><br />Instead, Hiccup and the black dragon, whom, thanks to retractable teeth he dubs Toothless, forge a friendship that leads to his discovering that humans have misjudged the entire species.<br /><br />Further complicating the relationship is the fact that Hiccup finds himself enrolled in Dragon Training; a gamut of human versus captive dragon barbarism that ends with one of the students having to slay a dragon before the blood-hungry town.<br /><br />It turns out that in Berk, just like in reality, a better understanding of one's enemy can often prove more impactual than centuries of doing battle with them.<br /><br />So if right now you're thinking this all sounds cute and clich&eacute;, rest assured that there is charm in this one no summary will be able to capture accurately.  The direction and pacing are absolutely spot-on here, so much so in fact that it often becomes difficult to even remember that this is an animated film (often considered the ultimate compliment to any animator).<br /><br />The characters and corresponding cast is marvelous with enough passion and range to keep the viewer's attention precisely where it should be (on the story).<br /><br />Visuals, as one might expect on a film that cost an estimated $165 million, are stunning- especially the fire effects and flight sequences (that look amazing on the home screen in hi-def even without the much ballyhooed 3D).<br /><br />Additionally noteworthy is the fact that overly expressive animal eyes and the development of the bond between Hiccup and Toothless is conveyed here virtually without dialogue, which suggests that DreamWorks has been paying close attention to Pixar's mastery of the medium.<br /><br />John Powell's score adds to the delicious flavor with its heart-thumping tension on down to heart wrenching intimateness and everything in between.<br /><br />In all, even a film as hyped as this one can stand to have a bit more praise heaped upon it simply because it delivers in just about every conceivable level.  Truly the business-model driven DreamWorks has its masterpiece that even the nerd-farm that is Pixar need be envious of.  Don't miss this, one of the finest specimens the genre has to offer!</p></body></html>

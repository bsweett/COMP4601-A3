Right off the bat I'm gonna tell you there is nothing funny about this movie so dont be misled like I was.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan plays a "facilitator", a sometimes charming, sometimes manic corporate assassin at the end of his career, and on the road to alcohol fueled burnout and total psychological breakdown. After 22 years in the "business" on the eve of his birthday, we see him in a lonely Mexico City hotel room frantically dialing random phone numbers of strangers he's collected around the globe who either dont remember who he is, or conveniently forget, driving him further into the bottle.<br /><br />Meanwhile a struggling businessman from Denver, Greg Kinnear, is celebrating what he thinks is a successful pitch to a local company (hahaha wait hahahahahahaha we are in Mexico City arent we? hahahahahaha) and is joined by a kneewalkin' Brosnan in the hotel bar over a couple of margaritas. One tequila too many, and Kinnear is insulted by a viciously drunk Brosnan, and walks out of the bar only to find his trip home will be delayed because his client is having second thoughts. Hmmmn?<br /><br />The next day Brosnan is able to recapture his previous nite's contact with Kinnear, makes amends, and they elect to retire to a bullfight where Brosnan later confesses to his new pal what he does for a living.<br /><br />Aside from being fairly humorless, this is a somewhat disturbing and semi-bleak character study. And you would expect a flick about a hired killer to involve some level of intrigue but there's none of that to be found either, particularly after two blown assignments his own crew turns on him making it known that he is next. But there's no near misses, no harrowing escapes, no betrayals or plot twists that you might expect. Instead, after months on the run and and elapsed time of 2 minutes, Brosnan merely shows up at Kinnear's home late one night to share a bottle of bad Irish whiskey, dance with his wife, and show off his .38 which no self respecting killer would ever carry in the first place. The climax is totally absurd with Mr. Everyday Everyguy going out on a mission with our reluctant assassin and gleefully volunteering to risk everything he owns by becoming an accessory to murder.<br /><br />A nice DVD package with terrific 5.1 audio, but this movie is highly overated. Brosnan's performance is the clear highlight of the film, however uncomfortable he may make you, and even that gets tiresome by the fourth act. 3 Trees</p></body></html>

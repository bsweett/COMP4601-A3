A virtual nobody in Hollywood until his sleeper hit, "Memento", Christopher Nolan appears to be the go-to guy for murder/mystery thrillers.  To Christopher Nolan's credit, after making the incredibly confusing "Memento", he chose to make a more straight-forward mystery thrill ride and the move pays off big time.<br /><br />"Insomnia" tells the story of LAPD detective Dormer (Al Pacino) who along with his partner, are sent up to Alaska to solve a startling murder of a teenage girl in a small quiet town.  The cops of this small town aren't sure what precipitated this murder, and they're not sure about the odd circumstances that surround the two LAPD detectives presence here, other than Dormer is a friend of the town's chief of police.  Things quickly get out of hand when a tip is given, as to the perpetrator's possible location, and a friendly fire accident leaves Dormer's partner dead and Dormer to blame for the shooting.  Things are only complicated further when the killer is the witness to the accidental shooting and knows that Dormer is trying to cover it up, because the reason LAPD sent them to Alaska, besides assisting in a murder investigation, was to get them away from Internal Affairs, and a "friendly-fire" altercation would seem greatly suspicious.  To top things off, it's the time of year in Alaska when there is constant sunlight, leaving Det. Dormer suffering from insomnia, and growing increasingly withdrawn and somewhat crazy.  With all of that occurring the killer chooses to use Dormer's guilt and cover-up as leverage in assisting him in placing the guilt of this small town girl's murder on someone else letting him off the hook.<br /><br />"Insomnia" is superbly acted and directed, with stand-out performances by Al Pacino (no surprise there), Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank.  Excellent cast, with great material to work with, all held together by an incredible director.  This is one thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat and is not to be missed!<br /><br />"Insomnia" is rated R for violence, language, and minor sexuality/nudity.</p></body></html>

Intricately written, wonderful cinematography , all the clues and twists meshing together like a gigantic 500 piece puzzle. The story has some little plot twists ,aside from the big ones which hit you like a bus,But the real gems are the little ones that make you say hey wait a minute...A really enjoyable series with lots to think about.Beautifully shot in HD than scaled down for DVD ,looks super on a nice TV</p></body></html>

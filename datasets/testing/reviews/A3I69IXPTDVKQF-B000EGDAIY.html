In sharp contrast to the Ring/Ringu situation though (I can't compare the two "Dark Water"s, as I still haven't gotten to the 2002 original), "The Grudge" is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of "Ju-On", bringing little new to the table.<br /><br />  As with the original, "The Grudge" follows the premise of a legend in Japanese folklore (apparantly really a part of that tradition and not just made up for the movie) - a person who dies an unnatural death, in the grip of a rage, will sometimes become a ghost known as a Ju-On.  These spirits are violent and vengeful and, judging from the "Ju-On" and "Grudge" movies, seem to act not necesarily in accordance with the kinds of people they were when alive, but lashing out quite indiscriminately in rage over the injustice of their own demise.  They seem incapable of differentiating between the living who they would have reason to bear anger against, and just the living in general.  Those who are killed by a Ju-On become one themselves, and the curse grows.<br /><br />  At the risk of repeating myself from when I wrote about "Ju-On" in its own entry, the troubles begin when a young home health care worker (who makes her rounds caring for various frail and incapacitated people in their own homes) enters a house to care for a woman who's recently moved with her family into a new home with a dark past.  Invesigating strange noises coming from upstairs, she discovers an unusual little boy behind a boarded-up wall.  And thus the first Ju-On makes his appearance, and the weirdness and darkness begins.<br /><br />  "The Grudge" has many of the same strengths and many of the same weaknesses as "Ju-On", which is fitting I suppose because most of the time they're the same movie, just with different actors (although some from the original reprise their roles here) and spoken in different languages.  As with the first one, there are some pretty implausible actions and reactions on the parts of the human characters in here; I found it overall to be less pronounced in this remake though.  Although both movies unfold in much the same style with regards to timeframes, I found this one easier to make sense of - it may be because I saw the Japanese one first and knew what to expect this time.  Or it may be because when "Ju-On: The Grudge" was shot, it was with the expectation that most Asian viewers would have already had a chance to see "Ju-On: The Curse 1" and "Ju-On: The Curse 2", the two Japanese made-for-tv-movies which "Ju-On: The Grudge" was itself a remake of (or, apparantly, it could be viewed as a kind of sequel if one was so inclined; I haven't had a chance to watch those two yet).<br /><br />  The overall production values in this movie are very good but the ones in "Ju-On" were a bit better, except for the special effects.  Here "The Grudge" wins out by a fair margin with truly great effects.  Both movies feature the same freakishly disturbing sounds made by the Ju-On ghosrs.  Those bizarre, utterly unnatural noises are just plain scary.<br /><br />  If one was just going on "The Grudge" and "Ju-On" you could really just pick either one and miss very little.  However, there's a catch - both movies's sequels are better, and the sequels actually follow completely different storylines from one another.  And they're each better served by seeing their respective predecessor first.  So personally I'd recommend both "Grudge" and Ju-On", although you'll probably want to watch them some time apart rather than one just a few days after the other.  They're both good movies, but I wish they'd made at least a few significant changes in this one; it's a lost opportunity that was, thankfully, more than made up for by the sequels being so far apart.</p></body></html>

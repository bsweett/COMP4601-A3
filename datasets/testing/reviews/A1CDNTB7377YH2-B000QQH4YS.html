<meta name="summary" content="Good Action Film of the Future!"></head><body><p>Along with the Terminator this was the best scifi action film to come out during the 1980's.  Though Peter Weller didn't become a household name, he does an excellent job as a murdered police officer, who is resurrected as a type of cyborg programmed to fight crime.  As "Robocop" he dispenses justice with computer controlled pinpoint shooting accuracy.<br /><br />There is a lot of camp (some of it is extremely funny) which does nothing to diminish the serious drama of the film.  Nancy Allen does a good job as Robocop's partner and look for the guy from That 70's Show as the evil villian.</p></body></html>

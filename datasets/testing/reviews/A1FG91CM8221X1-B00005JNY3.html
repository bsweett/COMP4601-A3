Softley builds the story slowly, marinating us in the spooky atmosphere of a dilapidated Louisiana bayou mansion, until we're just as hypnotized as the hapless heroine. That heroine, played by Kate Hudson, comes to the house to help a tart-tongued old woman (Gena Rowlands) take care of her stroke-immobilized husband (John Hurt). From there, she gets far more embroiled than she'd like in the hoodoo-laced history of the house and its inhabitants. Working from a screenplay by Ehren Krueger ("The Ring"), Softley places the pieces of the story in jigsaw-puzzle fashion; the placement of the last piece knocks you for a loop with a surprise ending you'll be thinking about for days. Hudson--who has much of her mother's charm, plus a certain pizzazz all her own--gives a totally satisfying performance as the heroine; Hurt (in a nearly wordless performance) and Rowlands also are excellent, as is Peter Sarsgaard as the family lawyer. As with all good thrillers, "The Skeleton Key" messes with our minds, rather than our gag reflexes. If you're a fan of "The Twilight Zone" (the TV series, that is, not the movie), chances are you'll love this.</p></body></html>

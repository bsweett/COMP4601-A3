<meta name="summary" content="Ridiculous Drivel"></head><body><p>This movie was just stOOpid. You have Mrs. Spielberg, Shia LeBeouf and the girl from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang running around being controled by the Hal 3000 computer (nice of them to bite off of 2001 with A.I. computer that is driven to madness by trying to understand human hypocracy and frailties). Billy Bob is in it looking skinnier than ever with his horrible 'natural' looking hair piece. Rosario Dawson and Michael 'The Shield' Chick-lets round out the cast but I find it hard to review their performances because the movie was so dumb it was mind numbing.<br /><br />This is one of those Bruckheimer type 'THRILL RIDES' that is devoid of an intelligent story and that is full of roller coaster ride like effects.<br /><br />STUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPID!</p></body></html>

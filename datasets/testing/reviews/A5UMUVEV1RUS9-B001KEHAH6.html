Plot has been fairly well covered by the Amazon reviewer as well as all the other reviewers here...no need for a play by play. It caught me off guard because it was so sweet, yet funny. I think it was the Amazon critic who said it was like a girly version of the movie Big. Jennifer Garner is terrific in this. She's adorable and all her facial expressions remind me of the wonder and curiousity of a 13-year-old girl's world. I remember being that age too, and wanting to be all grown up. The movie reminds us all that we shouldn't be in a hurry to grow up and that all things will come in due time. It also reminds us to be careful what we wish for and to treat people the way you want to be treated. Don't think it's all about the morals though. It's so much fun, and I love when they do the Thriller dance. If you're not convinced, rent it first, but I loved it so much I had to have it on my DVD rack.</p></body></html>

The movie stars William Holden and Alec Guinness as an American commander, Major Shears, and an English officer, Colonel Nicholson, respectively who are captives in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.  The camp is run by the heartless and maniacal Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and he has been put in charge of constructing a railroad bridge over the river that will be extremely important to the Japanese war effort.  Saito and Nicholson are at constant odds over the British captives role in helping build the bridge.  Nicholson does not want to aid his enemies in such an important task and Saito uses abusive and sadistic means of punishment to try and break Nicholson, but due to Nicholson's high honor, he never gives in.  Eventually the men reach a compromise and Nicholson throws his men into task of building the bridge with a fervent and obsessive nature.  A parallel story line concerns Major Shears who escapes from the camp, makes an inspired trek through the dangerous jungle and finds his way back to a base in the South Pacific.  He provides the commanders with the information about the bridge, but his true motives are selfish as he wants to go home.  He is forced into volunteering to guide a British troop back into the jungle to the prisoner's camp to destroy the bridge.  Along on this mission is the leader Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who is way too gung ho about it for Shears' liking.  The eventual intertwining of the two stories reaches a brilliant and rousing climax.  Director David Lean uses the jungle scenery of Sri Lanka to beautiful perfection to recreate the images of World War II.  He never resorts to gratuitous violence or mayhem , but expertly crafts a story about the psychological effects war has on three men who at first seem quite different, but in the end seem very much the same.  The film was a rousing success and dominated the 1957 Academy Awards winning a total seven including Best Picture, Mr. Lean's first Best Director Award and a truly deserving Best Actor Oscar for Sir Alec Guinness.</p></body></html>

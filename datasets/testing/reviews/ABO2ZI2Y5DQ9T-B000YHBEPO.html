<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Slick, Entertaining Summer Blockbuster (But Don't Try To Find Originality)"></head><body><p>Action-packed, entertaining `Mission Impossible III' is probably the best in this `MI' series. Actually it should have been the first installment of `Mission Impossible' franchise, one of the big hits coming from the star Tom Cruise.<br /><br />`Mission Impossible III' is virtually a train of well-crafted set-pieces of actions. The initial mission in Germany to retrieve a kidnapped agent leads to another action in Italy, then in America, and finally in China where Tom's Ethan Hunt must run, run, and run. These thrilling actions, enhanced by good stunts and CCI, would be a real treat for the action film fans. Well, some of you might not particularly like Mr. Cruise, who seems to have monopolized every single `impossible' mission of the agency, but Tom Cruise's performance is focused and credible, even though he sometimes acts like a real superman.<br /><br />The film's action sequences themselves are always fun, but they are most interesting when Tom Cruise is not a one-man band who can do ANYTHING. The best part of the film is the slick kidnapping sequence at Vatican where Hunt acts like a leader, not a hero, managing the whole operation like jugglery, using various high-tech gadgets. In the action sequence in Shanghai, in contrast, Ethan Hunt moves almost like Jackie Chan, never hesitating to jump from the top of a building to another.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman appears as a sadistic arms dealer, who knows something about one top-secret `Rabbit's Foot.' Though good supporting actors like Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, Lawrence Fishburne, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, and Keri Russell join in the cast, it is Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals the show, even from the star Tom Cruise. Unfortunately, the casting of Michele Monaghan as Hunt's sweetheart is a mistake for her character is a rather boring presence, a typical `lady in distress' role.<br /><br />Many viewers would notice that the third mission of Ethan Hunt and his men look similar to the countless films and TV programs they have seen, even including the two previous 'Mission Impossible' films. Yes, the not-so-original script of `Mission Impossible III' re-uses the familiar premises found in this genre, but director JJ Abrams keeps the ball rolling by providing the actions, if not the logic behind them. Though the film is far from original, `Mission Impossible III' is a great popcorn movie that is highly entertaining.</p></body></html>

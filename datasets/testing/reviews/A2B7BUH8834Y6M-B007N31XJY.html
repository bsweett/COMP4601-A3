<meta name="summary" content="Drop-dead funny, feel good film"></head><body><p>Julia Roberts is superb in portraying the very real, very fiesty Erin  Brockovich. Brockovich has a wit and intelligence that has been untapped in  her struggle to make ends meet as a twice-divorced single mom of  three.<p>Not only is it great to see someone down on their luck triumph,  it's even more cathartic to see that person achieve success beyond their  wildest dreams.<p>In the film, Brockovich is an endearing, caring mom, and  a bristly, spitfire hot-head to those who are in her way.<p>She ends up  being the instrumental researcher in a tainted water lawsuit that  vindicates hundreds of families that were taken for a ride by the local  water company - not to mention reaping great financial rewards for her  lawyer employer.<p>Albert Finney is phenomenal as the attorney that hires  her. His American is so flawless, it was hard to believe a British man was  playing this role - not to mention his perfect performance.<p>Nearly every  4-letter word in the book is spouted out in this movie, so it wouldn't make  a good gift to your kids, your mom or your church group.  In addition to  language, there is implied live-in sexual relationships that some parents  may not want their children viewing.<p>For adults, however, this was an  extremely entertaining film, especially when you realize it  is a true  story. Even the ending offers a surprise no one will expect.</p></body></html>

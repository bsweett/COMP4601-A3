<meta name="summary" content="Comfortable Enrty in the Series"></head><body><p>I'm not a huge a Star Trek fan, but I have enjoyed the movies as well as the Next Generation TV series.  As such, I found this latest movie to be an enjoyable and comfortable entry in the series.  Continuing the trend of the even number movies being better, Nemesis (#10) is arguably better then Insurrection (#9).  Plus, many favorites pop up in cameos.  <p>The Plot: An apparent coup d'etat occurs on Romulus, and the Enterprise is sent to investigate.  When Picard meets the new leader of the Romulans, he's shocked to see a striking resemblance to himself.  The Enterprise crew try to work with the new leader, but suspect treachery.  The special effects are not particularly impressive, especially in light of other recent sci-fi movies, but then Star Trek has never been just about the f/x.  The movie explores issues of cloning in a relatively interesting, but precursory, manner.  The DVD includes many deleted scenes, which help explain some of the underdeveloped plots (e.g., Troi's mind-melding) and underused characters (e.g., Dr. Crusher).  <p>Overall, a pretty good Star Trek movie that is likely to appease fans of the series; non-fans are likely to be a bit bored and unimpressed.  Patrick Stewart has said that this movie is the last for the Next Generation crew, so enjoy!</p></body></html>

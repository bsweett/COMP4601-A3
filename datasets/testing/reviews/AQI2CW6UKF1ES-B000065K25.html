My brother had it, so I though i'd check it out.  <p>And man, it just made my summer a bit better.  It tells a good story of a ban heist gone bad.  6 robbers in a diamond heist, but ones a police informer, and everybodys at eachothers throat trying to find the rat.  It also shows, how the main characters got involved with the heist.  <p>And the movie is a little violent(Something I like seeing in movies nowdays).  Another strange thing is, I don't like 70's music, but I somewhat liked K-billies sounds of the 70's.  I was saying hugachaka when they were saying it and stuff.  <p>Well if you love movies with suspence in it, or a good mystery trying to be solved then this is the movie you should look at.<p>Peace</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tom Clancy Meets Desperate Housewives"></head><body><p>Check reality at the door and The Sentinel will entertain you for a good hour and forty-five minutes. It moves fast; it's suspenseful and very well acted and directed.<br /><br />There are two plot lines going on: A Secret Service agent is having an affair with The President's wife, and there is a conspiracy plot to assassinate The President. (This President is really down on his luck!)<br /><br />The film is well put together, but the whole idea that someone in The President's close personal Secret Service entourage could actually be turned as a spy, not just as an informant, but as an assassin's aide is...well...far-fetched.<br /><br />And that The President's wife could ever be out of the public eye or the Secret Service's eye long enough to start an affair is...well...just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />Plus you have Eva Longoria as a special agent which is about as believable as Pamela Anderson was as a Hollywood bodyguard in V.I.P. (1998 - 2002 TV series).<br /><br />That all said, The Sentinel was a good movie. I was entertained enough to want to keep watching without getting up for a break. Kind of like a Tom Clancy novel meets Desperate Housewives.<br /><br />Rent it.</p></body></html>

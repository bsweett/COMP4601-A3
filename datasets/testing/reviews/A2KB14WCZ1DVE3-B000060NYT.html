<meta name="summary" content="Scared the hell out of me"></head><body><p>It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this scary.  Most of the &quot;horror&quot; movies of the last 20 years or so have been the teen slasher films, which turned into the jokes of the scream series.  John Carpenter had the masterpiece in Halloween, but I would classify what he's done since as more science fiction.  And then there are the psycological thrillers, like &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, which have their moments but hold back on the gore.<p>&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; has it all.  There is no holding back on the gore.  When the creature starts eating a victim's tongue, while still attached to the head, it doesn't get any better than that.  We get close-ups of victim's stiched-up bodies.  And the final scene would make Buffalo Bill proud.  <p>Where it excels, though, is atmosphere and tension.  I remember that the plot of &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; was not that great, but the setting of the house in that movie was as creepy as it got.  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; goes beyond this.  We see that something awful is probably at the monster's hangout.  We spend time debating whether to enter it's confines.  When we finally get to see it, the buildup pays off big-time.  It would be hard to design a scarier environment than what Justin Long falls into.<p>The only reason that I don't give it five stars is explained in the movie itself.  Most people, after seeing the setup, would high-tail it out as fast as possible, and let the authorities take over.  But our hero has to not only go back to the scene, but literally stick his nose into it.  His more logical sister tells him that this is the typical stupid thing that people do in horror movies, and she's right.  <p>But then, we wouldn't be treated with what follows.</p></body></html>

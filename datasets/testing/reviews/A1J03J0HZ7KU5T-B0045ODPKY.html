<meta name="summary" content="Jolie Breaks On Through in Wild Action-Thriller"></head><body><p>Guided by Phillip Noyce's masterful direction, "Salt" (2010) provides a memorable action vehicle for Angelina Jolie. This preposterously entertaining spy thriller moves at a fast clip with plenty of dynamic set-pieces and plot twists. Liev Schreiber effectively underplays his role as a pursuing CIA agent - an ideal counterpoint to Jolie's vigorous presence. Far superior to the recent Bond and Bourne entries, with a "Salt" sequel already in the works.</p></body></html>

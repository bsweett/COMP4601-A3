<meta name="summary" content="High expectations...Underwhelming, but Visually interesting and entertaining."></head><body><p>I had high expectations for this movie, especially after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y69NG">The Ultimate Matrix Collection (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions/ The Animatrix)</a> series, but Keanu Reeves seems to be playing the same character over and over in different films.  This movie reminded me of his portrayal of previous characters, but mostly he just seemed flat.<br /><br />Despite the casting issues, the movie is visually appealing and the special effects are usually great.  The movie, however, kinda plods along, and I get the feeling that Keanu Reeves would rather be somewhere else.<br /><br />One bonus for me is that The Evil One looks a heck of a lot like my ex-father in law, and that seemed appropriate...but that's just a singular, personal bonus.  Seriously, this is a flawed movie, but it is worth watching.  I expected more, but the visual effects and several scenes compensate the viewer for the slower scenes and general feel of the movie.</p></body></html>

If you've seen the "The Thin Red Line,"you've seen, to some extent, the same movie.  Oh, the subject matter is completely different (WW 2 battle flick vs. Jamestown story), but with Mallick this almost seems beside the point - since what he cares about is the Human Condition and other BIG bellybutton pondering Why Are We Here kind of questions.  And Mallick does approach these questions with a poetry and style that leaves the viewer thinking.  Imagine, if you will, a Stanley Kubrick who actually cares about people, and you have Mallick.  But in a long movie -at some point, a viewer wants a story to break out.  What Mallick delivers instead is an Art Gallery.<br /><br />Precise period detail, gorgeous cinema photography, performances...?  I suppose they're pretty good, though it's hard to get much traction with the characters, since they are just part of the scenery.  The credits say John Savage was in the movie.  I must of missed him.  And Wes Studi is just used as Native Background.  (By the way, Natives and their reactions to the Jamestown settlers are first rate, and for that reason alone make the New World worth seeing.  One senses that Mallick did an enormous amount of research for this film.)  Colin Farrell is ok as John Smith, looking appropriately all moody and lank-haired, but given Mallick's structure, it's hard to penetrate that character's motivations (what was that flipping over the table thing all about?).  For example, why did he turn his back on a relationship with Pocahantas?  I'll admit the answer very well could of been right in front of me, but by that point in the movie, I was floating on a dream, and such character specifics could of slipped right on by.  But that does bring me to the performance of Q'rianka Kilcher as Pocohantas.  She is incredible, and by movie's end, she has made the story (overwhelmingly) her own.  Pocohantas's transition from nature romping Indian to the wife of an English man (an effective Christian Bale as John Rolfe) is not some sort of flat trajectory, but one filled with complexity and nuance.  To pull that off, you need a great actor - and a great director.  On that count at least, Mallick struck gold.</p></body></html>

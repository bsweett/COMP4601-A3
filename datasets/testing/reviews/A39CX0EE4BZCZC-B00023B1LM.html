<meta name="summary" content="The Good & Bad Of ''The Bourne Identity'"></head><body><p>This is a solid suspense-spy film with an agent-on-the-run scenario. People who like a paranoid theme, where everyone is after you (I plead guilty) will love this.<br /><br />The amount of violence in here was just about right, not too much and not too little. I also enjoyed the Paris scenery, both the street-level shots and the aerial photography. Ovrall, the cinematography is very good in this film. It's an involving story that once you're hooked, you stay that way. The two hours go by pretty quickly.<br /><br />On the negative side, I get tired of American filmmakers trashing their own government all the time, in here its them trying to kill one of their own agents. I hear the third movie is really bad in that regard. I'm sorry to hear that as I liked the sequel ("The Bourne Supremacy") even better, although part of the reason was that I was now familiar with the main characters after watching this film. Anyway, I highly recommend the first two Bourne movies for fans of suspense, crime, intrigue, good locales, etc.</p></body></html>

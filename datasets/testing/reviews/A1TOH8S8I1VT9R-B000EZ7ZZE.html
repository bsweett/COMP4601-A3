<meta name="summary" content="R.E.:  THE GAMERS VERSION."></head><body><p>When I first rented the original "Resident Evil" I was completely shocked at how much I liked it.  I had zero expectations for it, yet was sucked in by it's story, characters and visualisation.  So I ran out and purchased it (as soon as it was on sale).  Since then I've watched it about 10 times, which is pretty remarkable considering I have roughly 350 DVDs to choose from.  Given this, as a non-gamer, I was surprised to find that gamers were generally disappointed in this movie (not all of them, but most negative reviews were from gamers).<br /><br />Now we have "Resident Evil- Apocalypse".  Don't get to see "grown-up" movies at the theater, so I had to wait until the DVD release.  I liked the first so much, I did not even think of renting this.  I quickly bought the DVD (when it went on sale, never buy at full price)with much anticipation.  Roughly 3 years later I have viewed it approximately (well, ACTUALLY)1 time.  That's right, no type-o.  JUST ONCE.  It was not nearly as compelling as the first film (to me).  Gone was the gripping story, the great camera work, the excellent character development.  In the stead of this great stuff was some sort of "made-for-cable" goofy monster movie.  Now, I did not hate it, (I actually like goofy monster movies) but it is not begging me to watch it again.  It's so in-your-face that after one viewing, there was nothing left to see.  No mystery.  No subtlety.  No sense of future dread. It was done.<br /><br />But wow!  Gamers really like it!!  Now it all makes sense.  Since I find shooter games extremely redundant and difficult to play more than once, I found this movie to be the same.  A one timer (OK maybe 2). Kind of like sixth sense.  Once you get to the end, well..  ...it's over.<br /><br />Cinematically, comparing this to the first film is like comparing the first "Star Wars" to the last (I'm talking release dates, not "Lucas-Time").  It's comparing something that is a carfully thought out and woven tale, to something that is simply a series of events strung together to make a story.  Kind of like Shooter video games.  You travel down a linear path and take on what's in front of you.  Unfortunatly this is a film!<br /><br />I can't say don't buy this if you liked the first.  It's nice to have a continuation of the first.  Just don't go in with the same expectations.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No nightime bathroom trips for me!"></head><body><p>I went to see this movie on opening night, not having seen the trailer, not having seen the original movie nor having the pleasure to read the book. I had a general idea what it was about, but I hate how trailers these days leave nothing to the imagination. I noticed that with scary movies this is the way to go!<br /><br />Many of you know the premises and more history than I would probably know, so I won't repeat it.<br /><br />Other than the house being freaking creepy, demonic heart attack on a plate, it was really scary to see this loving family movie into it, where every pore of your body wanted to yell at them not to go in there.<br /><br />Sitting there in the dark theater, and wanting to close my eyes all the time, I felt like everyone's breathing stopped at certain parts. One of the creepiest parts is when the little boy goes to the bathroom. Yeah, for some reason bathroom scenes are freaking horrifying lately, and this one was the worst! I mean the best scary bathroom trip I've ever seen! &#61514;<br /><br />The characters are very real and I rooted and cared about them, so watching crazy stuff take over them and make them turn against each other was tough.<br /><br />Overall a very good scary, make you jump on your seat, bite your tongue and close at least one eye flick!<br /><br />Very enjoyable, just dont compare it to everything else ever made and have fun, watch it with an open mind. It will blow you away.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cars is about the journey, not the destination"></head><body><p>The Pixar team has infinite creative brain cells. They are an always-in-evolution machine, capable of providing us with the most unimaginable but amazing stories. Every Pixar movie is an exercise in universe creation, and Cars is not an exception.<br /><br />This is a world populated entirely by automobiles. No drivers, passengers or people; their windshields are eyes, their grills are mouths.<br /><br />The protagonist is a hotshot rookie race car named Lightning McQueen, an arrogant who thinks he doesn't need anyone but himself to conquer the world (and some trophy called The Piston Cup). With him, we get very early, that this is the story of how McQueen will learn what's really important in life.<br /><br />"Cars" is about enjoying the journey, not getting fast to the destination.<br /><br />While McQueen is on his way to the final showdown in California, he gets lost and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs where he gets sentenced to community service. Eventually, the hotshot befriends the "weird" locals, who will teach him exactly what he needs to learn; the importance of having friends to support you, the loveliness and charm of small-town values and the most important one: how shallow and meaningless are the notions of fame and prestige.<br /><br />That a coveted trophy is -after all- "just an empty cup".<br /><br />Cars have that Pixar/Disney charm and good vibe, but it doesn't capture the emotional resonance offered in their past films. The animation looks amazing, showing us how vast and unforgettable the world can be. It's good and it entertains. It has heart and spunk. But it's just not enough. Maybe it's because the storyline is not that original, maybe it's something else. But it's certainly a lovely movie, and one hell of a ride.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You might think Nacho is a bit salty but it does have a comedic taste."></head><body><p>Nacho Libre is a ridiculously funny movie. All of my favorite comedies are completely silly, and Nacho Libre is no exception. There is plenty of stuff that makes no sense, as you can pretty much tell from the first "training" scene. But the chemistry is there with the cast and the script is so off-the-wall that you have to be completely lacking a sense of humor to not crack up while watching Nacho Libre. Director Hess does a great job in giving Black freedom to steal the show. The movie depicts a Mexican Priest who has a secret fantasy to be a Luchador (Wrestler). Nacho Libre (Black) attempts the difficult task of living the life of the Luchador as well as the Priest of the orphanage.<br /><br />You have to appreciate the subtleties! Jack Black uses a lot of physical nuances as punch lines, so you must pay attention or you'll miss the jokes. I don't know much about Mexican wrestling, so I am not aware of how this movie will be accepted by fans of the sport. But it is funny. Do not look to the script or story for any judgment regarding this movie's merit, because the charm lies solely in the acting. Many of the greatest moments were created by a combination of manner and timing, as well as editing of course. My only slight complaint about the film is that sometimes Jack Black is a little too Jack Black and not enough Ignacio. He lays his normal schtick on a bit thick now and then and puts the character and the lucha libre storyline on the backburner. But as a fan of lucha libre I really loved the way it's portrayed in this film. There are some nice action sequences and the last fight scene is really unique and well done. Plus the Human Tornado cameo will have PWG fans marking out.<br /><br />This movie is obviously a product of Nickelodeon Studios, and the humor will be appreciated by fans of Jimmy Neutron, Sponge bob, and other Nicktoons. If you're a fan of Jack Black and Tenacious D you'll enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

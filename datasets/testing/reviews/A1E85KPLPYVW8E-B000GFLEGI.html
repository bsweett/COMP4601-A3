Romero's last film, Day of the Dead, was put out 20 years ago and since then fans have anxiously been awaiting the next chapter in his zombie saga. 2004's remake of Dawn of The Dead was enough to suffice our flesh-eating needs for the time being, but offered nothing new to the story. And now Romero returns to the silver screen with Land of the Dead, and although isn't bad for a zombie flick, it just feels like there should be something more to it. What has Romero been doing for the last twenty years? His time obviously wasn't completely spent working on this.<br /><br />I don't want to sound like I'm totally dissing on this movie because I'm not. There's a lot of interesting, fresh and new ideas that were put into Land of the Dead. What's different about "Land" that seperates it from the earlier films is that by this time, the zombie epidemic is now established, and people have found a way to live (but dangerously) in a world overrun with zombies, unlike the earlier films which covered the time when the zombies first started taking over the world and covered people's reactions to it. Another thing that's new is that by this time, the walking dead have started to develop early signs of emotion, the use of weapons, and the power of working together. They even learn to swim. Seeing all this was very cool, but I feel that most of these ideas weren't developed to their full potential. Maybe we'll see more of that in next film, hopefully before the next twenty years.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me about the film was it's rather anticlimactic ending. When the end credits rolled I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. It seemed the movie ended abruptly and left me feeling somewhat satisfied, but wanting so much more.<br /><br />So all in all, I do recommend seeing Land of the Dead because I've noticed very mixed reviews for this one, so it's hard to say if you'll like it or not. I, personally liked it and I'm sure when the DVD comes around I will have no choice but to buy it, but I feel like 20 years in the making, Land of the Dead should've offered just a little bit more, and I see it like lacking in the charisma that the earlier films had.</p></body></html>

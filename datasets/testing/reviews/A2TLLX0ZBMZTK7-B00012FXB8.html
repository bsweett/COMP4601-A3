The story is only somewhat decent, I honestly kinda found it interesting that Ripley was impregnated with a queen alien, but at the same time I knew that it would have to lead to her death, WHICH I DID NOT WANT. Guess what? She died, too. So yes, killing of the entire cast of survivors from Aliens was an absolutely TERRIBLE move. AND, why did they feel the need to shave Ripley's head...? The suspense just didn't seem to be retained from previous Alien movies, either. This movie... Just no. No. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

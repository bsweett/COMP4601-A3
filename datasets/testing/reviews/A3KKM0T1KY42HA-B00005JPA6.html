<meta name="summary" content="El Laberinto del Fauno"></head><body><p>The Labyrinth of the Faun--Pan's Labyrinth--surprised me on a few fronts: It was R-rated; it was in Spanish; and it was a very very good movie...one of the best that I've seen this year.<br /><br />But then my expectations were set to excellence knowing that Pan's Labyrinth is a Guillermo del Toro film. Del Toro first caught my attention back in 1997 with Mimic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558908323">Mimic</a> , a fair attempt at Sci-fi/Horror. After Del Toro did the second installation <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKWJ">Blade II (New Line Platinum Series)</a> of The Blade Series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WFX62">The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)</a> in 2002, he went right onto my watch list of directors whose next movie that I don't want to miss (and he has not disappointed).<br /><br />Other than seeing the trailer and identifying Pan's Labyrinth as a Del Toro film, I'm glad that I didn't bother to read anything else about the movie prior to seeing it (which I always avoid as much as possible in order to keep the element of surprise in play), because I might have been discouraged by a lot of the "Spanish fairy tale with English subtitles" comments.<br /><br />Forget fairy tale, folks. Did I mention R-rating? Very rarely do you see any movie described as a fairy tale with an R-rating. And the R-rating is really too bad here, because it definitely cost Del Toro some box office bucks. But you have to hand it to the guy for keeping the integrity of the film intact. There's one scene (okay...maybe two) that sealed the R-rating and could easily have been lightened up involving a local farmer and his son confronting the fascist Capit&aacute;n Vidal assigned search out and crush anti-fascist rebels in post Civil War Spain.<br /><br />The star of this movie is young Ivana Baquero in the role of Ofelia. While the idea of this tween venturing so bravely into such a dark fantasy is a bit stretched, Baquero really makes you believe that she believes it. The movie starts with Ofelia and her Mom en route to their new accommodations at the camp of Capit&aacute;n Vidal and his troops circa 1944.<br /><br />Upon arrival at the camp, Ofilia is shown a Labyrinth where she meets one UMF (ugly male faun) named Pan who gives Ofelia a Book of Crossroads, which explains tasks that she must complete in order to escape her new living arrangement and take her place as Princess of the Underworld.<br /><br />Doug Jones is Pan and also the eerie Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth, and this guy plays a great monster. Del Toro used him in 2004's HellBoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008EY65">Hellboy (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> as the aquatic Abe Sapien, and you can see him as The Silver Surfer Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer out in theaters this month.<br /><br />I'm pretty liberal when it comes to what I'll let my kids watch, but Pan's Labyrinth is out of reach (mainly due to the brutalities of Capit&aacute;n Vidal as opposed to the nightmarish images). For adults...fans of Horror/Sci-fi/Fantasy shouldn't miss this genre gem.<br /><br />P.S.--There's often an aversion by some to watch a movie with subtitles, but I'd highly suggest resisting the English audio track and going with the natural Spanish audio track with English subtitles to add that extra element of reality to this well done fantasy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek - TMP :A Brilliant Sci-Fi"></head><body><p>A famous author once remarked about a &quot;rose by any other name is still a rose.....&quot; Those words come to mind when I think of the first transition of Trek to the big screen.The plot of this science fiction film  is indeed worthy of Kubrick and Clarke, and yet because it is the familiar  pop-icons of Star Trek who play out this space opera that somehow makes the  viewer more comfortable about what is going to unfold on screen.  It is  a rather complex plot with a lot of techno and spiritual babble that will  no doubt confuse the young who view this for the first time(as it did me  when I was 11 and saw it at theatres for the first time!)yet it works  because we are all too familiar with maybe how Kirk will deal with that  gigantic cloud, or how Spock will interpret meanings beyond what any human  could grasp.Some felt that Star Trek TMP was too slow and cerebreal, that  in its transition from t.v. to bigscreen it had somehow lost the wonder of  the series.I disagreed as I sat there mesmerized by the stunning  visuals,Jerry Goldsmith musical score, and all-too-familiar t.v. icons.It  is still a rose however you look at it!</p></body></html>

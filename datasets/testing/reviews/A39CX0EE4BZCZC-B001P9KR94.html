<meta name="summary" content="Blu-Ray Sharp, Brings Out Great Photography"></head><body><p>I thought the best part of this award-winning film was the photography, and this Blu-Ray disc makes this movie magnificent-looking. They even make slums look beautiful! This DVD transfer is very sharp and the colors are bold as can be. It makes me glad the film won the Oscar for cinematography.<br /><br />Story-wise, it's okay; good, but nothing super. For the first half of the film, it reminded me of "City Of God," about the homeless kids in Brazil, but that film had far more violent kids. This one mainly had kids as pranksters and then victims of some sicko adult who wants to use them to make money.<br /><br />The story will be fun for those who used to be hooked on the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" quiz show. Almost all of the story is told in flashback, so be prepared for that. It's one of those stories where all the little pieces fit together in the end to explain why things happened in the start of the film.<br /><br />Overall, it is entertaining and certainly a feast for the eyes on this Blu-Ray disc..</p></body></html>

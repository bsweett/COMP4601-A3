<meta name="summary" content="This is Not a Zombie Movie!"></head><body><p>Get it straight!  There are no zombies in this movie, just very, very, very angry people infected with Rage, the virus.  The cinimatic style of this movie is quit addicting, which I found to be similar in The Beach.  The story is really good for this type of movie also and the characters are very beleiveable.  There's not too much blood, but there is a healthy amount.  It's worth it for anyone to see.</p></body></html>

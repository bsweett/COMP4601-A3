<meta name="summary" content="The stupidity of film critics and elitists is growing much bigger than I'd imagined"></head><body><p>That's right. It seems as if it is being forgotten why exactly we go to the movies... to be entertained. To go to a movie and watch it and have fun. Not every movie is meant to be Academy bait, and as much as I love a good Oscar bait flick as much as anyone, I also like to go to movies that are supposed to be brainless fun- after all, that's why I go to movies, right? As a form of scape. Ah, but it's not like the elitists know how to have fun anyway, because after all The Green Hornet- No me likey superheroes!!! Me likey psychotic lesbo ballerinas!!!!!<br /><br />That said, I will admit I was a tad skeptical- I wasn't very immersed in the Green Hornet world as I did not grow up with it, but the trailer looked fun and I was excited to see it, so my buddy and I went and saw it today. And I walked out colored had-fun!!! Like I said, I knew absolutely nothing about Green Hornet when I went in, as I had went to see it not based on nostalgia but entertainment alone, and I got what I wanted- a fun old, funny, quality time at the cinema that was full of laughs and action. So maybe I lose credibility there as I wasn't a fan before the film. But now I can confirm that my childhood already good childhood would be MUCH better if I grew up with Green Hornet!!!<br /><br />BrittReid has had a troubled relationship with his dad ever since he was a young one. Now grown up and an heir to his dad's newspaper The Daily Sentinel, he always thought his dad was a selfish jerk, and his dad being found dead from a supposed bee sting doesn't make it better. Being left the newspaper and meeting his coffee maker for the first time after firing him, named Kato, Britt is under pressure. But Britt and Kato begin to bond after Kato shows some of the 'wares, and one night after stealing the head of the golden statue of his dad and kicking some butt, they decide with Kato's technology and Britt's motivation- it's time to be superheroes.<br /><br />But they aren't the superheroes you'd wake up every Saturday morning and tune to your cartoon channel to watch. No, they are way different. They protect the law... by breaking it. Furthermore, the Sentinel dons them the name "The Green Hornet", and they find a villain- Chudnofsky, a man with a hard name to pronounce, who is a Russian mobster who plans to bring together LA's mob families.... and the man that Britt's dad was planning to expose!!!<br /><br />I will say one more time that I am surprised that we've forgotten how to have a good time at the cinema! Sure this film isn't going to win any Oscars and bait gleaming reviews from the critics- one particular offender being Roger Ebert. But then again I stopped taking him seriously years ago, so not much I can do there, besides he gave Country Strong a positive review. This film is fun, and what's all you need to expect!<br /><br />It's full of action. It's full of thrills. It is overexaggerated and it's unrealistic as hell. But that's the point! It's a superhero movie people. None of you complained when in The Dark Knight, Batman fell a great height from the party in the building, survived without a broken bone. The action scenes are awesomely well done, with great use of slo-mo, and even in 3D, the "Kato-vision" scenes looked awesome. The fight scene in the middle between Kato and Britt that goes on and on was probably the funniest scene, as you'd expect to get tired, but it just gets funnier and more ridiculous as it goes on.<br /><br />So overall, if yo have a brain you are willing to turn off for 2 hours and just sit back and enjoy pure fun, you will enjoy the Green Hornet. My only quibble is that there wasn't enough Christoph Waltz, but then again, I had tonnes of fun- too much to care about that, so I ain't complaining there. Just go and watch and have fun, as this is a great start to the new year's movie season, and a must see for belly laughs, action and quality dialogue.<br /><br />Oh, and you will believe a car can drive when it's split in half!</p></body></html>

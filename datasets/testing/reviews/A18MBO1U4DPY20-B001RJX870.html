Hitler, little do I know, did a lot of wrong things but he did a lot of right to lead men with enough armor in their hearts to fight the world. The Russians were kept at bay. Germany alone did everything and then there was "Der Untergang" ... Stunning storyline, sometimes or better known as history. Sigh. There's so much more to learn in life than how shoes lose their souls or soles, whichever you prefer.<br /><br />I love the way the soldies, german soldiers, have an attitude of nonchalance as if nothing can possibly go wrong and they go about taking orders like they always have. So used to drudgening every possible enemy. I like that side of them. I like that side of humanity.<br /><br />Downfall is a good film. I thought it would have ended when Hitler gives away. Rather than showing what happened to individual characters, if I was the director, I'd show what happened to the world than these few character names I would forget in a hurry.<br /><br />I do not know German. I want to. Now.</p></body></html>

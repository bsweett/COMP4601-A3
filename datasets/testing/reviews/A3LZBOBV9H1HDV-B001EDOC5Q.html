This is how the story goes: One year later, the Kings and Queens of Narnia find themselves back in that faraway wondrous realm, only to discover that more than 1,300 years have passed in Narnian time. During their absence, the Golden Age of Narnia has become extinct and Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines and is now under the control of the evil King Miraz, who rules the land without mercy. The four children will soon meet a curious new character: Narnia's rightful heir to the throne, the young Prince Caspian, who has been forced into hiding, as his uncle Miraz plots to kill him in order to place his own newborn son on the throne. With the help of the kindly dwarf, a courageous talking mouse named Reepicheep, a badger named Trufflehunter and a Black Dwarf, Nikabrik, the Narnians--led by the mighty knights Peter and Caspian--embark on a remarkable journey to find Aslan, rescue Narnia from Miraz's tyrannical hold, and restore magic and glory to the land. The directing by Andrew Adamson (who also directed "Shrek" (2001) & "Shrek 2" (2004, also wrote the screenplay and story), he also did the screenplay and directed "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe" (2005) is great! The screenplay (based on C.S. Lewis' novel) by Adamson, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely (both Markus and McFeely, with Adamson, wrote the screenplay to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe") is great! The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (who also did the music to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe") is excellent! The cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is excellent! The film editing by Sim Evan-Jones (who also did the film editing to "Shrek 1 & 2" & "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe") is great! The casting by Pippa Hall, Liz Mullane, & Gail Stevens (all three who also did the casting to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe") is great! The production design by Roger Ford (who also did the production design to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe") is excellent! The art direction by David Allday, Jules Cook (who also did the art direction to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe"), Jill Cormack, Matthew Gray, Klara Holubova, Stuart Kearns, Jason Knox-Johnston, Elaine Kusmishko, Charles Leatherland, Phil Simms, Jir&iacute; Sternwald, Frank Walsh is excellent! The set decoration by Kerrie Brown (who also did the set decoration to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe") is excellent! The costume design by Isis Mussenden (who also did the costume design to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe" & the upcoming "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader" (2010) is excellent! This is a great sequel that is faithful to the original movie, although darker than the original. A great summer movie that will keep you thinking.</p></body></html>

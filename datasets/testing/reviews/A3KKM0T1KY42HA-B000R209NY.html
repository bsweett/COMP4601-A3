Poseidon accomplishes neither.<br /><br />The Poseidon Adventure (1972) was a better movie than Poseidon. It had better actors. And sadly the special effects were just as good in the original from over 30 years ago. Shameful.<br /><br />Here are some examples of random silliness without the movie trying to be silly:<br /><br />-Lots of fires but absolutely no smoke.<br />-Civilians are smart enough to try to find a way out of impending doom but none of the ship's officers agree.<br />-A guy blindly dives from a ledge into a flooded room assuming that it's deep enough and there will be nothing in the water to impale him.<br />-Several rafts conveniently waiting upon escape from the ship into the water.<br />-Immediately after escape the ship sinks...nick of time escape is goofy.<br />-Rescue calvary consists of 2 commuter-type helicopters...not the coast guard.<br /><br />Oh and there's plenty more silliness. Don't buy this. Don't rent it. Wait for cable at best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good action movie"></head><body><p>If you like action well this film should be good. What we have here is an attempt to make a movie based on real social issues of child soldiers and the profits of diamonds used to fund dubious political movements.<br /><br />The story I found in many parts over the top. So they made a movie full of stock characters. Good moral reporters trying to help the locals for humanity sake, world officials' who are trying to do some good and not so bad mercenaries who look like they are modern cowboys finishing off with a Hollywood happy ending.<br /><br />Having said that some of the scenes for example when the rebels took the town, killed, cut peoples hands off and took many into slavery, I thought were good.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />The acting was nothing special. The casting was not good. DiCaprio should never have put in that role. It did not suit him.</p></body></html>

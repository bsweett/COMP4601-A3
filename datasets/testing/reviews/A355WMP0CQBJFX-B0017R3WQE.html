<meta name="summary" content="AL PACINO IS THE MAN!!"></head><body><p>scarface is one of my very favorites. this movie is very powerful, beautifully done, and one of the most influential of all time. no matter how many movies al pacino does, he will always be known as tony montana aka scarface no matter what. this role was made for him, he was born for this. the rise and fall of this man, the love he won and lost, the power he earned and abused, the drugs he bought, sold, did, and that destroyed him. at the end he went out like a real man, taking a lot of fools with him. he went down like a soldier, but they killed him from the back like cowards. this was the life for him, the life he dreamed of, the life he achieved, but in the end it caught up to him. it always does. it got to him. the life and everything that came with it. for a brief moment the world was his. a guaranteed pleaser. no doubt.</p></body></html>

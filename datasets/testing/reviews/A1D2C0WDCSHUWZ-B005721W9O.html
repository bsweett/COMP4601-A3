<meta name="summary" content="Funniest film of 99"></head><body><p>As a ravenous Trekker and fanatical SF fan, I was dubious about a spoof, however well-written. I was stupid. This is the funniest movie to be churned out of Hollywood in recent years--and it's only PG!<p>&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was a popular cult SF show years ago, but now the stars do little but appear at conventions and sign autographs. Delightfully Shatnerian Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) is approached by perpetually smiling aliens the Thermians, who believe that the adventures of the &quot;Protector&quot;'s crew are recorded real adventures. They ask him to help them defeat the hideous insectoid General Sarris--in a real, constructed starship &quot;Protector.&quot; Thrilled out of his pants, Nesmith brings along his initially unwilling friends to save the galaxy!<p>Tim Allen shows that he's an excellent actor OUTSIDE of sitcoms, so like Shatner that it's simply uncanny. The voice, the delivery of lines, even the rather inflated ego are all there.<p>Sigourney Weaver plays Gwen DeMarco, who is frustrated both by her small role on the show and the fact that all interviewers have ever asked her was about her bust size. A combination Counselor Troi/ Lieutenant Uhura, she basically repeats what the computer says. She explodes in frustration at one point: &quot;I have one job on this ship--it's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay! &quot;<p>Alan Rickman wears an alien head as Alexander Dane, a cranky actor who hates always being second fiddle and resents Allen and his role throughout the movie. Tony Shalhoub drifts innocuously through the movie, paying only marginal attention to the amazing events around him.<p>Daryl Mitchell plays a grown-up Wesley Crusher character, who was piloting the ship at the age of ten. Sam Rockwell plays a truly unique role--he was a redshirt who got killed on the alien planet of Episode 81, and now believes that he's going to die because his character doesn't have a name. Enrico Colantoni plays the leader of the Thermians, whose vacant grin and singsong speech patterns steal all his scenes... &quot;Weeeeee... need your help.&quot;<p>There are a million funny moments and in-jokes that Trekkers will notice: The ship scraping against spacedock, Nesmith rolling around in preparation for action, Guy freaking out because he's a redshirt and he's doomed to die, Nesmith losing his shirt during a fight to display his manly chest, Gwen yelling because of her small role, ridiculous obstacles in the bowels of the ship, and so on.<p>Perhaps the funniest part of it all is the Thermians, who have formed their culture around the adventures and friendships of the Galaxy Quest crew. Wouldn't it be great if that were true?</p></body></html>

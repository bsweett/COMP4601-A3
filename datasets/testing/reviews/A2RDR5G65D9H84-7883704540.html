<meta name="summary" content="Foodies! You have to watch this!"></head><body><p>This movie has a plethora of characteristics that make it remarkable, an ultra-funny script, endearing characters, superior graphics and animation, and the fact that it can be shared and loved by the whole family. However, being someone that works closely with the restaurant industry and that is en route to becoming a foodie, I was surprised by this film in terms of how well it presents the stereotypes that you are likely to find in this world. The use of satire based on these characters left me satiated and happy to have sat through a wonderful meal...err movie :)<br /><br />Every possible stereotype in the food world makes an appearance, from the bitter and lonely critic, to the egotistical chef that is not as good as others think, and he knows it. In the middle of this, we find an aloof young man starting out from the lower echelons in the kitchen of a famous restaurant, who could only succeed with the help of a real gourmet. The fact that this food connoisseur is a rodent is just a minor kink.<br /><br />I believe that most people will agree that watching this movie is a great experience, but if you are a foodie, you cannot afford to miss it. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

Christopher Nolan adeptly manages to hold the strands of his main character's constantly disappearing memory together, but if not for the stunning performance of Guy Pearce the entire premise of the film would collapse like a house of cards. Joe Pantolino, and Carrie-Anne Moss are also excellent in this suspenseful, ever-twisting, puzzle that definitely puts the 'mind' in mindgame. MEMENTO is superb.</p></body></html>

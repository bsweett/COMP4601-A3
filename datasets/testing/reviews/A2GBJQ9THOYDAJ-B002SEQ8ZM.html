<meta name="summary" content="Up to Gaiman's usual standards of weird"></head><body><p>This is a wonderfully original and imaginative stop-motion animated rendering of Neil Gaiman's juvenile book of the same name. Dakota Fanning is the voice of Coraline Jones, an adolescent girl whose parents have dragged her off to an apartment in an isolated hilltop Victorian so they can finish writing a gardening catalog. Though bored out of her mind, she's also adventurous and self-reliant, and it's not long before she discovers the secret door hidden behind the wallpaper in the parlor that gives her access to an alternative world with apparently wonderful alternative parents. Of course (as a story like this requires), not all is as it seems in that distorted world. The other tenants include the retired circus man, Mr. Bobinsky, and the elderly Misses Spink and Forcible (and their wall full of stuffed deceased terriers), and a feral cat with very fixed opinions when it comes to rats, and who attempts to give Coraline good advice which she waits almost too long to listen to. The plot is classic cautionary (and rather dark) fairy tale and the character details and bits of business are classic Gaiman. [I note most of the one-star reviews are actually complaints about the rendering of the 3-D content. Frankly, I didn't even know it *was* 3-D. And I don't especially care.]</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two stars for a character, five stars for the movie"></head><body><p>Not for the squeamish, Eastern Promises paints a bleak picture of the grungy underworld of London, where Russian gangsters are involved in the most heinous acts, and even the most innocent eventually become pawns in the most dangerous game.<br /><br />When a baby is born to a very young woman Tatiana, the childbirth is too much for the mother.  After delivering the baby, midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) finds a diary written in Russian among Tatiana's possessions.  Opening the diary is tantamount to the dangers within Pandora's Box; and in Anna's case, that initial curiosity involves her in the seedy underbelly of a crime family living by the brutal code of Vory V Zakone (Translation: Thieves in law).<br /><br />Among the criminals is Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortenson), a lowly, yet influential driver, whose position has allowed him the constant close proximity to both the gang's patriarch,<br />Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and his tempermental son Kirill (Vincent Cassell).  Investigating the diary and the baby's lineage further immerses Anna into the gang's world, its crimes, and its secrets, until the movie reaches its gripping conclusion.<br /><br />Regarding the performances in this film, Viggo Mortenson is as powerful as any of his other roles.  He's as stoic as can be, and regardless of the outcome he manages to appear dangerous and sympathetic at the same time.  Speaking in Russian he's convincing and even his accent when delivering lines in English is impressive.  From top to bottom, the slicked hair, the rigid emotion, the facial structure, and the tattoos, he is a gangster.  Speaking of the tattoos, I quite enjoyed the subplot which incorporated the rich meanings and symbolism behind the Russian criminal tattoos.  Without previous knowledge, this is the type of "tour guide" information that provides enjoyable depth and intrigue, and otherwise would be easily looked over.  Each of the other characters is fully involved, and they deliver competent performances.  Watts is sympathetic, and the combination of anguish and determination on her face reflects her character's passion for newborns.  Similarly, Stahl is perfect as the crime syndicate leader.  He's one of those calm yet calculating figures who doesn't often get his hands dirty, but when he does he may as well have red skin, horns, and a pitchfork.<br /><br />My hat goes off to Director David Cronenberg for delivering one of the best films I've seen in a while.  It's truly captivating, with each character, line, and setting truly serving a purpose.  With only one underdeveloped angle - Nikolai Luzhin's secret background - there is nearly nothing superfluous.  For a script that already upped the malevolent ante, the bathhouse knife fight is a perfectly heinous coup de grace to drive the point home.  This is a great film, and comes highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Movie of 2009"></head><body><p>The best picture of 2009 wasn't a movie about giant blue aliens with a plot stolen from DANCES WITH WOLVES.  Nor was the best picture of 2009 a low-budget film about a military bomb squad in Iraq.  Both of these movies are good movies. However, neither can compare to the elegance, beauty, and simplicity of UP.<br /><br />Though there are other characters in the movie, UP is the story of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner).  The first fifteen minutes of the film touchingly tells the story of Carl's life.  He grew up wanting to experience adventure, married the girl of his dreams, and together they lived a very happy-though sometimes bittersweet-life. By the time the opening sequence has concluded, we already have an appreciation for Carl and a longing to have known even more about his deceased wife, Ellie.<br /><br />Carl is old, but he's also determined.  Skyscrapers and strip malls surround the old house that he and Ellie so painstakingly restored and though the land developer has offered to pay Mr. Fredricksen handsomely for his home and property, he refuses to sell.  However, in the end, through a careless act on Carl's part and a huge wrangling of the judicial system by the developer, Carl is forced to sell his property and ordered to move.  But, good old Carl is stubborn and sets about turning his entire home into a giant airship through the use of thousands of helium-filled balloons.  When the men from the retirement home come to take him away, Carl leaves them behind as he flies up, up, and away.<br /><br />Carl thinks he's alone as he begins his journey to see Paradise Falls in South America, the dream destination he and Ellie always wanted to go.  However, there's a stowaway aboard on the front porch, a Wilderness Scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) that Carl thought he had gotten rid of by sending on a snipe hunt.  Carl reluctantly agrees to take Russell with him, but on the condition that Russell will go home once they reach Paradise Falls.  But the journey to paradise is filled with all kinds of strange and even dangerous adventures: terrifying heights, thick vegetation, talking dogs, rare endangered birds, and an ancient explorer bent on capturing his prey no matter what the cost.<br /><br />Unlike 2008's WALL-E, UP doesn't have an agenda.  Instead, it's a story about one man's redemption.  Carl is a good man who lived a good life, but the death of his beloved Ellie not only turned him crotchety, but caused him to lose his way.  It takes the unbridled honesty and passion of a child to get Carl back on track and face what he could become, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer).<br />Of course, if that's not enough for you, UP also features all kinds of comedy for all ages.  Kids will love Dug and the rest of the talking dogs.  Adults will appreciate the zingy one-liners Carl delivers.  There are also all kinds of allusions throughout the movie (e.g. the dogs in the airplanes repeat lines taken directly from STAR WARS).<br /><br />UP has great characters, moving story, and witty dialog.  Simply stated, it's the best movie of 2009.<br /><br />The regular DVD includes the shorts "Partly Cloudy" and "Dug's Special Mission". "Partly Cloudy" features a stork sent to deliver dangerous baby critters.  The stork longs to have a regular delivery like the other storks, but in the end realizes just how important his job is.  As a side note, in watching UP you can catch a glimpse of a few of the clouds from "Partly Cloudy".  "Dug's Special Mission" illustrates what happens to Dug immediately preceding his discovering of Carl and Russell in the Jungle.</p></body></html>

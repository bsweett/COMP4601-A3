<meta name="summary" content=""War is young men dying and old men talking." - Odysseus"></head><body><p>Troy is an epic story loosely adapted from Homer's Iliad, which is in its own rights an epic masterpiece.  The story is known to most people who were probably coerced to read it in either high school or college as it was required reading in order to receives a passing grade.  Most probably found the tale difficult to read as it was written in prose, which left most readers missing a story full of intrigue as humans and gods are faced with deceit, love, bereavement, faith, war, heroism, despotism, and much more.  The divine portion of the Iliad is immense as the god's choices always reflect upon the humans, but in Troy Wolfgang Petersen decides to focus on the human aspects of the tale.  This creates an interesting perspective on the story as the many characters still deceive, kill, love, commit heroic deeds, and much more.<br /><br />Troy begins with depicting Agamemnon of Mycenae (Brian Cox) who is on the war path as he seeks to conquer all of Greece and become the king of kings.  The many battles that Agamemnon faces are decided with very little bloodshed as he suggests to each king that if their best warrior can beat his best warrior then he will retreat, but if his best warrior wins then the opposing king will have to pledge his legion to him.  Agamemnon's best warrior is Achilles (Brad Pitt) who seeks immortal fame through the battles that he fights and he also strengthens the confidence of the men in the troops.  However, Achilles also believes in his independence as he believes that the kings should fight their own fights, which makes it difficult for Agamemnon to handle Achilles.<br /><br />The Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) is welcoming peace with Troy as Hector (Eric Bana), the throne prince of Troy, is visiting Sparta with the duty of declaring peace.  In joy Menelaus and Hector celebrate the truce between the cities while Hector's younger brother brother Paris (Orlando Bloom) is secretively courting Menelaus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger).  On the voyage back across the Aegean Sea Paris reveals the secret to Hector as he has persuaded Helen to return to Troy with him as they have fallen in love with one another.  Hector is furious as he realizes that the truce is broken and a war might be approaching in the near future unless they return Helen to Sparta.  Nevertheless, Helen sails to Troy with Paris as Hector is not willing to give up his little brothers life on account of his love for Helen.<br /><br />Wrathful vengeance boils within the veins of Menelaus as he discovers that Helen has left him for one of the princes of Troy, which leads him to visit his brother Agamemnon in a request to seek his vengeance on Troy.  Agamemnon understands that Helen's abandonment of his brother has provided him with an opportunity to ensemble all the troops of Greece to attack Troy, and his advisors recommend that they also bring Achilles.  This is something that Agamemnon resents, as he hates Achilles and his independent manners.  Despite his own dislike for the man Agamemnon listens to his advisors as he send for him through Odysseus (Sean Bean), the only person that Achilles respects.  When all troops arrive they set sail for Troy as Agamemnon has gathered the largest army ever, which is 50,000 men strong.<br /><br />When the many ships arrive to Troy the audience is to see a siege of enormous proportions as the 50,000 men settle on the beach outside Troy.  The siege of Troy offers many interesting views of the characters as intrigue begins to build up and create different camps within the Greek camp.  Achilles' hatred for Agamemnon and vice versa depicts an interesting perspective on power and the symbiosis between characters that detest each other.  There are also several interesting comments such as Odysseus talking to Achilles: "War is young men dying and old men talking.  You know this.  Ignore the politics."  These comments offer much to reflect upon as the siege of Troy continues to kill husbands and fathers.<br /><br />Troy is depicted through radiant cinematography, which uses many vast shots where the background seems to go on forever.  The camerawork and lighting also offer several shots with silhouettes of the characters, especially of Achilles.  These silhouettes provide an interesting notion for the uncomplicated existence of Achilles as he perceives life rather black and white as he fearlessly moves through the battlefield with no thoughts of the death he is delivering to other.  The casts performances are, however, unbalanced and it affects the complete cinematic experience as it on occasion feels too 21st century, and in other scenes it is nothing but brilliant.  Altogether, Troy offers a solid cinematic experience, which provides the audience with several lessons and morals in regards to war and the aftermath of war.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Porn and Minimal Gore"></head><body><p>"Hostel" leads you to believe that this is going to be a very scary movie with lots of violence that haven't been seen before, and all it gives in the end is porn and things done to death in horror movies. The story is so basic; you don't even have to hear what they are saying to get this movie. There are times when I was watching the movie and said something to someone and still understood what was going on, even though I didn't hear a few lines. There is nothing shocking in this movie and it is very predictable.<br /><br />The gore is almost absent and is nothing extreme; I have seen more gore in the Friday the 13th series. About the first thirty to forty minutes of the film is sex and more sex. This is not a film for the kiddies, that's for sure. Overall, if you want a movie that is like this but actually has a good story, watch the Dentist and the Dentist 2. This film has nothing special at all. The movie is not scary and not gory. It misses all the points that made the Saw series great, which it tries to live up to in this film. This movie isn't horrible by any means, it just not all the hype leads you to believe. It is a soft core porn movie with a little blood thrown in.</p></body></html>

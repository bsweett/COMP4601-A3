International man of mystery Ethan Hunt takes on yet another case involving top secret arms, beautiful ladies who kick butt, evil villains, and world travel.  The only difference in this movie is that now Ethan has decided to settle down and has recently gotten engaged.  This, of course, provides all sorts of opportunities for the torture of his new lady friend at the hands of the evil villain he's trying to take down. The plot isn't that stellar and we never really know what Ethan's fighting for. However, this film was directed by J.J. Abrams (creator of Alias and Lost) and, as expected, has an air of mystery that is typical of his work.  For Alias fans, this movie has Milo Rambaldi written all over it, and for Losties Abrams threw in a shout out to the Hanso Foundation in the credits. Otherwise, like the previous two Mission Impossible films, this movie is action-packed and entertaining the whole way through.  If you like movies like action movies with pretty ladies, you'll enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

Good performances from all the actors, and Britany Murphy (she suprised me). Comic book come to life, very over the top. Loved the black, white, grey and red atmosphere color.  Very dramatic and lots of violence but it goes well with the storyline.  It's nice to know someone has some imagination left. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

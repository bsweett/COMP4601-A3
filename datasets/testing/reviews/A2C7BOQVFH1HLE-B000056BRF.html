<meta name="summary" content="Great Epic Now In Stripped-Down Blu!"></head><body><p>For those like me who like this film but not to the extent of getting the full-blown collectors' version we get here a truly stripped-down but mostly satisfying version of one of the great epic films.  No expense was spared in what would probably cost a fraction to produce what with CGI today but clearly was a tremendous undertaking in 1959.  There are many memorable scenes here such as the battle at sea and the chariot race but also the less exciting tender scenes among Ben-Hur and his family showcase just how good the quality of the cast is.  For a 53-year old film the 1080p transfer represents the best picture transfer of the film to date; while certainly not reference quality it is still a worthy effort for the most part.  The sound quality though is more impressive with an excellent job done in this DTS-HD MA transfer which ranks among the best I've ever heard and comes closer to reference quality for Blu-ray.<br /><br />As this is a stripped-down version the special features aren't that special with just trailers, a music-only track and a commentary the only items on offer here.  Still for me personally I am satisfied with the film in a lower-cost version without the frills.<br /><br />Good picture quality, great sound quality and a great epic movie makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></body></html>

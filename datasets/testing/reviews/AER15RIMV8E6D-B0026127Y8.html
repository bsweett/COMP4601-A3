<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Action-Packed Film!!!"></head><body><p>I thought this was a really good action film! Everybody did an awesome job. This movie is like Max Payne, 24, and Commando all mixed together in one movie! When his daughter is kidnapped and fixing to be sold on the Black Market, Bryan Mills comes out of retirement to save his girl and kill the bad guys! Filled to the brim with action and suspense, I highly recommend TAKEN!!!</p></body></html>

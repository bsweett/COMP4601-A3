<meta name="summary" content="The Lure of the Bull Fight Symbolically."></head><body><p>This movie is aptly named.  The best thing in it is the actual bullfight where the individual matadors are shown as icons.  Not the killers they are, but as the victor over the big bad bull, with their forceful 'quick kill.'<br /><br />Julian is a master of the quick kill, but his are done the cowardly way, from afar with explosives or high-powered guns like Oswald's, though he struts around like a peacock dressed as James Earl Ray, real assassins.  "You are what you do" is the prevailing theme through this globetrotting adventure of the dark side of life.  He calls himself a "faciliator of fatalities," remarkable for someone so dumb.<br /><br />When the two main characters meet in Mexico City, in a bar no less, the nasty person tells the gullible American to "think positive."  Then, he parlays him into going to a bull fight for which he already has tickets.  "You've never seen Mexico City until you've seen a bull fight with a matador form Spain, ole!"<br /><br />He's an assassin with no friends and no place to call home, how incredible.  With Danny, Julian becomes a leech and tells lies which catch up with him six months later.  The mythical scene of Danny asking Julian to kill his competitor so that his company in Denver will get the contract didn't happen -- Danny did not open the door and let the corrupt hitman into the hotel room, nor did he say goodbye.<br /><br />When things start getting worse for the assassin, and he's lost his nerve to fulfill some assignments, he runs to Denver at Christmas time, as he has no place else to go -- no family, friends, or home.  Danny asks, "Why don't I believe you?" about needing his help to 'off' someone at the horsetrack in Tucson.  "I tell the truth when I can," and "truth is unacceptable" in his field of work ("My business is my pleasure."), he sets up an elaborate scheme to kill an innocent bystander to prove to Danny that he is not as strange as he may seem; they are opposites, which makes the movie bearable to watch.  When that goes awry, he admits that "it won't last, that's a given," but he had nowhere else to go and no one in the world to talk with on intimate terms.  The song at the end, "Just Hold On," left you feeling deceived.  It was a strange premise for a movie (I went only because I had a pen pal in Spain many years  ago and wanted to see what a real 'matador' looks like.  There were at least three, all wearing pink stockings, and they did look fantastic.), but the acting was marvelous.  Now, we know who can take over Anthony Hopkins' weird roles, Pierce Bronsan.  He showed his other side in this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So lame, barely even worth reviewing"></head><body><p>1.  I have several concerns related to this movie.<br />  A:  First of all, I can't believe how many people gave this movie a favorable rating.  I'll just leave it at that.<br />  B:  Second of all, this movie suffers on several fundamental fronts.  The acting... well, it's just lame.  The portrayals were uniformly stiff and unconvincing.  It was just very boring watching these people act their roles.  And then... the story itself was convoluted / unrealistic / dumb etc...<br /><br />2.  Thus, when you have terrible acting and a more lame / convoluted plot line=a complete dud of a movie.<br /><br />3.  By the way, another piece of evidence that this movie is a complete dud:  it's on amazon prime streaming.  Look I love amazon and I'm a prime member, but there's a reason certain recent movies make it to prime streaming; ie no one is willing to pay to watch it etc...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing Rocks with the people of Alan Silvestri"></head><body><p>This movie was fun, I read many negative reviews about the movie from people who expected something more then an action/adventure movie but it doesn't matter cause soon as Alan Silvestri (composer) start with the main theme of the movie (one of the best I heard recent years) you forget all logic and put your legs on the table and enjoy the ride, Hugh Jackman and all other actors are doing their job as limited as they are with their acting skills and Sthepen Somemrs who made a horrible movie a few years ago (The Mummy Returns) come back to form and direct some intense action scenes. "Van Helsing" will not win any awards, it probably won't have any sequels due to it's small box-office success and it will probably be forgotten in a few years, yet all  of that doesn't matter the fact that I found this movie very entertaining just like last year's underrated "LXG" (although LXG is much better) and I recommend it for all of you who like good action movies.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10</p></body></html>

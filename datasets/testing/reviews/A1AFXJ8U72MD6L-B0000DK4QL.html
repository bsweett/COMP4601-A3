Ben Affleck plays a good enough Matt Murdock and his costume looks better than the ones in the old comic books. The fight scene at the bar needed some editing but most of the other scenes were somewhat good to very good. Garner delivers an average performance as Elektra. One of the problems with this film is that there were several logic holes. See spoilers at the very end if you want to read about some of them. Good choice with darkness and lights. Pretty good soundt rack fitting the themes of Daredevil even if some of the lyrics are a bit too much on the nose. Jon Favreu plays the beloved sidekick Froggy, Colin Firth plays Bullseye, Michael Clarke Duncan plays the Kingpin, Erik Avari plays Elektra's father and Joe Pantoliono plays the intrepid reporter. Small appearance by Ellen Pompeo, as the secretary of Murdock and Froggy's firm, who would later star in "Grey's Anatomy". The Razzies nominated Affleck for worst actor but the nomination was unjustified. The budget for this film was $79M and made just a tad under $180M at the Box Office. Even though it did well there were a number of attempts to continue with the franchise but too many obstacles have yet to produce Daredevil 2. All said, a refresh to Daredevil is in the works and that's the main reason I watched this film again. SPOILERS: Elektra should have known she was fighting Matt long before she removed his mask; the fight scene between Matt and Elektra looked cool but a blind guy fighting it out publicly in front of a ton of kids is going to get passed around and then the secret identity is revealed. Woops. If his opponents knew that extreme noises would stun Daredevil why didn't they use them to great impact at the end of the film rather than fighting off? Those dudes weren't exactly chivalrous in combat.

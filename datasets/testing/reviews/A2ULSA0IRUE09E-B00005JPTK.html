<meta name="summary" content="Almost A Sci-Fi Classic : Just Off the Mark"></head><body><p>There are a few sublime moments in "I Am Legend" that make you realize just how amazing a science fiction film can be. The genre has long been my favorite, and even though this isn't a sci-fi film in the strictest sense of the term, it has shades of the genre all through it.<br /><br />Prime moments include Will Smith entering a dark building in search of his dog, and then battling with monsters he never knew existed (literally). There is one particularly effective scene, where Will Smith knows that his dog has been 'infected', watches his dog turn into a monster before his eyes, and then kills it with his bare hands. The entire sequence plays out like a subdued exercise in human tolerance and reaction - and it was carried out superbly by Will Smith.<br /><br />In fact, it is Smiths' amazing screen presence and top-notch acting ability that makes this film as good as it is. However, he is let down by a very weak script, a nonsensical ending, and is paired opposite a tepid actress in the second half who reduces the film to a parody of itself. My primary problem with the second half is that it entirely undid all the solemn promise the first half did. The climax is a huge group of monsters (very poor CGI here) trying to attack Smith, who in turn destroys himself and the facility so that the monsters perish as well. This 'Save the World' sentiment has been overdone in way too many Hollywood films, and it just didnt work here.<br /><br />The best parts of 'I Am Legend' are when it slows down to a quiet, sombre pace. The first hour, with its languid passages of just Will Smith walking and bonding with his dog are the most poignant, and the most real. This is a one-man movie, and its a pity that when it moves away from that, it doesn't work. By no means a classic, or even a 'very good film', but this is one movie well worth watching - it could have been much, much worse.<br /><br />Three Stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ok, based on a true story. So what? Not all that interesting."></head><body><p>And so Oscar nominated for best picture of 2011???? And Brad Pitt for best actor??? You have to be kidding me on both accounts. This is a slow, very slow, drama with a subject most will care little about.  My take on this movie is that it was a Brad Pitt project of some kind and in retrospect, should have been very cheap to produce as really not much more than a stage play with limited scenery sets and actors. Honestly, how could anyone get all that emotionally involved in a movie that has only "baseball team member selection" at its core???? Intended audience?  Perhaps 30+ year old males with a love of baseball but no one else. If you have a wife or girlfriend and although they may love Pitt, do not try this movie on them. No sex, no violence, no nothing of note or interest. Oscar nomination for best picture????? "The Help" is 1000 times better in all reguards that this turkey. Not recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic!"></head><body><p>Great movie, and certainly way better than the 2003 film "The Hulk".<br /><br />In the 2003 film "The Hulk", you really saw the computer input in the movie graphics and you could tell it was fake. In "The Incredible Hulk", it all looked real.<br /><br />I even was happy to hear the soundtrack of the old Hulk series. I was also happy to see them give tribute to Lou Ferrigno, the true incredible hulk.<br /><br />What was new about this movie is seeing a villain with very similar powers to the incredible hulk, instead of the classical Hulk vs the army where he kicks their butts throughout the movie. This time we see a real match to the powerful hulk.<br /><br />Definetely a great improvement in the Hulk prequal, and I salute the casting team for choosing Edward Norton to play the hulk role.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Apollo 13, You Are Go For Launch!"></head><body><p>"Apollo 13" is my favorite dramatic movie of all time. The Apollo program still intrigues me, and I still regard it as the greatest technological triumph in the history of the world. Before Ron Howard made this movie, most people had forgotten about Apollo other than knowing that men walked on the moon (though there are those that dispute even that now): some could recall Neil Armstrong's name, but few could remember anything more.<br /><br />Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did the world a great favor by reminding people of the human risk and personal sacrifice required by the Astronauts and their families. "Apollo 13" is not only a great work of cinema; it is a great historical document that will last long after the last of the Apollo Astronauts has passed on.<br /><br />The film itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking effects, and many scenes filmed in the NASA C-135 "Vomit Comet" parabolic flight "Zero-G" aircraft. This film stands the test for realism and drama. I am extremely familiar with the Apollo mission profiles, and am impressed by the accuracy of the production, although certain concessions to absolute accuracy were made to tell the story in two hours out of necessity, and many of the technical conversations include background information that the real participants would not have bothered with as it would be obvious information to them. Nonetheless, the film is very authentic looking, which I attribute to the Howard and Hanks authenticity requirements, as well as having Dave Scott as a technical advisor.<br /><br />The extras are great; I particularly liked the other Apollo 13 documentary, although I was a bit less enthused by the "Conquering Space" offering. The best extra is the commentary track with Jim and Marilyn Lovell, which explains what they like about the film, interesting backstory information, and occasional technical corrections from Jim.<br /><br />This is the best drama I have ever seen. Buy this one today: it's a keeper.</p></body></html>

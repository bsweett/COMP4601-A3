<meta name="summary" content="Office Space"></head><body><p>Long before TV shows like "The Office" and other work comedies "Office Space" hit a cord with most office workers. This 1999 movie pointed out printers that suck, bosses that suck, and employees that suck. It makes the keen observation that employees with backbone and creativity are capable of becoming managers or embezzlers that fear picking up soap in prison. We see three key employees hatch a plan to get enough to retire on once two find out the companies downsizing includes them. The irony is the employee worried about where his office moves and stapler will end up is the one that truly gets even with the boss and company in one fell swoop. This is a reasonably funny movie that has good replayability. Good quality DVD with a few extras on the special edition with flair. If you enjoyed this catch "Employee of the Month" and "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

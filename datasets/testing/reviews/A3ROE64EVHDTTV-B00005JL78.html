Its story line in itself provides an entrancing mixture of suspense, thrills, and action (all naturally embellished by Speilberg's direction).  But there's more to this film than that.<p>The entire movie is filmed with monotonous colors (except for one flashback scene).  There are many gray, black, white, and blue colors (similar to the way &quot;Payback&quot; was filmed).  I wouldn't doubt that the coloring of the film adds an artistic level to it, and perhaps highlights some important motifs.  It also makes the future world appear darker and gritter, despite the effects of excessive commercialization.<p>There are other interesting motifs involved, including water (water water everywhere!) and eyeballs (many closeups of eyeballs, not to mention the fact that the main character gets new eyeballs installed in his sockets).  There are a lot of interesting devices in the film that gives it cinemagraphic depth.<p>The film's ideas of the future in themselves are interesting, particularly since they are derived from a compilation of minds.  There are holograms everywhere and retnail scans everywhere.  Privacy is starting to become abolished.  Genetic technology was discussed briefly.  There are many other aspects, but the most abundant seems to be the role of visual graphics.  Holograms and motion video have become a part of daily life - everything is in motion.  People can even manipulate the video images with their hands, as if they were orchestrating them in a holographic orchestra.<p>The characters of the film are fairly well developed.  I found the most interesting characters to be the 'precogs' who can detect murders before they happen.  They remind me of the guild navigators from &quot;Dune,&quot; only the precogs are more emotional and traumatized characters.<p>Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable film, perhaps even the best Speilberg film of them all (it is certainly my favourite Tom Cruise film).  It's visions of the future, characters, and story have stuck to my brain like an echo.  I can't help but to see it again...and again...like an echo...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films about Hitler ever made"></head><body><p>I can't praise "Downfall" enough for it's historical accuracy and superb acting. I first saw this film in a dark theatre and constantly had the feeling of being in the bunker and actually watching Hitler and his entourage during their final days. Things I love about this film:<br /><br />BRUNO GANTZ<br /><br />"Downfall" would not be the powerful film that it is without veteran Swiss actor, Bruno Gantz. He is the first actor who managed to convince me that it really was Hitler on the screen and just not an actor mimicking Hitler. It's like the man was born to play this role and got it right in every respect--his expression, his gestures, his voice, his speech acts, his posture, really everything.<br /><br />THE LOYAL ENTOURAGE<br /><br />Powerful performances were delivered by the rest of the crew as well. As with Gantz they had me convinced. While they were merely excellent, though, Gantz was perfect.<br /><br />BERLIN<br /><br />The scenes of battlefield carnage in Berlin were completely convincing. Ironically a few blocks of St. Petersburg (Leningrad), Russia were used to film the final days of the capitol of the Third Reich.<br /><br />HISTORICAL ACCURACY<br /><br />The film was beautifully researched and unlike other WW II era films like the incredibly wretched "Pearl Harbor" was historically accurate to the point of perfection. I love it when filmmakers fall in love with their subject to the point where research and accuracy clearly becomes a labor of love for them.<br /><br />THE W FACTOR<br /><br />OK, it has to be said: many of the mad ravings of Hitler and his entourage in the last days of the bunker were eerily reminiscent of the current regime in this country. At a certain point when he hears the bombs falling all around him, a fanatical Joseph Goebels declares that everything happening is right because "the German people gave us a mandate!" Sound familiar? And faced with a military debacle of his own making, Hitler carries on as though everything is fine and going according to plan. Sound familiar? As the curtain draws around them, Hitler and his entourage remain enraptured by their ideology and fanatically resistant to any kind of objective analysis. Sound familiar? Whittled down to their last days in the bunker, their political agenda is finally exposed as nothing more than theatre. Sound familiar? And of course anyone who interprets the harsh reality around them in a different light is branded a traitor. Sound familiar?<br /><br />No, I'm not saying that W and company are mass murderers on an even remotely comparable scale (they've mass-murdered in the tens of thousands not tens of millions). But I am repeating what many educated people have already publicly observed, namely that the mindset between the fascists in that bunker and the fascists in this one is remarkably similar.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A must own"></head><body><p>This is one of the best DVD's I have ever purchased without seeing it first.  A beautiful, often sad documentary about the impressive emperor penguins and the annual journey they endure for love and breeding.  Narrated by Morgan Freeman, this captivating documentary will pull at your heart strings and at times you'll want to jump into the screen to try and cuddle those adorable penguins. It may even make you want to take a holiday there just to view them in person.<br /><br />It was amazing to see the harsh conditions that these creatures endure year after year, temperatures such as 80 below zero!  If you want to see truly selfless acts of love, then take a glimpse at the lives of the emperor penguins.  We could all learn alot from them!<br /><br />The DVD is a must own. It also contains additional documentaries and the trailer. One of the documentaries (on the Region 4 version) is from National Geographic where they go travelling with the emperor penguins. Amazing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Crash"  this movie! Short and Sweet Review."></head><body><p>We saw Wedding Crashers on wednesday. It was great! I am not going to spoil the movie for you but it was soooooooooooooo funny! Owen Wilson putting eye fluid in to Sac's drink, Sac shooting Vince Vaughn in the ass, Vince Vaughn getting jacked off at dinner and it was sooo funny. I reccomend this movie to you if you like comedy! So go see it!</p></body></html>

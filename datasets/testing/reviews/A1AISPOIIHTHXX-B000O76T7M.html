Since then fans have been wondering what would've that battle looked like? Well this film gives the answers, well, more or less.<br /><br />A satellite owned by Weyland(an ancestor to the Aliens Weyland apparently) finds a heat blume reading below an island in Antartica. With technology, they found out it originated inside a massive pyramid with remnants of Aztec, Mayan and Cambodian pyramids, suggesting it's the first pyramid ever built. Weyland sets up a team to investigate, only to find 2 races who've been warring for centuries.<br /><br />What freaks you out about Alien is the claustrophia and the feeling that something was in the room you just didn't know where. Predator had a villain who was able to become invisible besides an odd optical effect and had blades and a shoulder mounted cannon.<br /><br />This film is sort of in the middle of course. The film does have plot holes that a train can drive through. The predators are supposed to hunt aliens who've hatched out of hosts? So what was that predator doing in the first one killing off uninfected people? Or the fact he had to "earn" his cannon when he had it in the beginning. And of course there's the 100 years thing, despite the fact Arnold and Danny Glover fought them less than 10 years apart.<br /><br />But taken on it's own, it's quite a fun film to watch, especially when the actual fighting starts, and it has a really suspenseful climax, but of course in typical Paul fashion, he leaves it wide open for a sequel, which if he could correct the faults of this film, it could be quite good but this film I like, but who knows how you'll take it.</p></body></html>

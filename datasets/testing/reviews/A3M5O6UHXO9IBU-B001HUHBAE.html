<meta name="summary" content="A disquieting comedy?"></head><body><p>Another sprawling comedy about a man who goes mad? May as well corner the market in something. However, the introduction of levity in the midst of a brutal murder scene, while matching the tone later to emerge in the film, appears at that point to be incongruous and queasy. It may be historically accurate, but as director you can choose what to emphasise. It just made me think too much of Brad and Janet of "Rocky Horror" fame. Aside from that, it was a wonderful film. Although marginally shorter than the average Tarkovsky, it mostly zips by.<br /><br />I do find that Fincher's films don't tend to stand up to many repeat viewings and I've drawn a blank as to why. Maybe an element missing or the fact they tend to resolve around working through a puzzle and once that's solved, there's not enough else to them. Remains to be seen if that's the case with "Zodiac", but you MUST see it in the theatre for its truly stunning photographic job. And no better time to fall in love with Chlo? Sevigny.</p></body></html>

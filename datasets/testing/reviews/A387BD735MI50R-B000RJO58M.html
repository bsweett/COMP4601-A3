<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Has It All"></head><body><p>Well, there is no actual romance in this movie - but there's almost everything else. There is good spoofing humor, an endearing buddy/sidekick relationship, some examples of astute crime detection, some grisly murders, a number of slam-bam car chases, and an over-the-top shoot-out.<br /><br />The shoot-out perhaps lasts a little too long, but it is inventively choreographed, so it will probably appeal even to those who generally prefer subdued, drawing room dramas. At the center of all this merry mayhem is a straight-arrow model of a modern police officer - played with super-hero stalwartness by Simon Pegg. He's a throwback to the old cowboy heroes in the movie/TV serials of the 1950's. And what a relief! He has no baggage, no "humanizing" flaws. He is not a recovering alcoholic; although he is divorced, he is not shown agonizing over parental failures; he's not a womanizer or a sadist.<br /><br />It's not that this is a dully PG film. Some pretty rough language swirls through the action, and there is a fair amount of blood spatter. In spite of this though, "Hot Fuzz" ends up being a feel-good, rejoice of a film.<br /><br />It also surprises audiences with cameo or supporting performances by some established British actors who haven't been seen much in films lately and about whom you just might have been wondering, "Where are they now?" For example, there's Billie Whitelaw. She's tackled some gritty roles in British films, starting in the 1950's. But I most remember her from hilarious romps such as "Make Mine Mink" with Terry-Thomas. She does a wonderful turn here - simply working a crossword puzzle. Then look for Edward Woodward of "Breaker Morant," "Wicker Man," and TV's "The Equalizer" fame.<br /><br />There's no Director's Commentary on this disc, but there is a "trivia" subtitle option. By clicking on this accompaniment, you can learn how a lot of the characters' names and place names are homages to characters and settings in other, often obscure, but hip films. One not-so-obscure film that is often echoed in this way is "Straw Dogs." A lot of these details really are trivial, but if you enjoy the kind of spoofing inherent in subtle cross-referencing and self-referencing - knowing that the film is rife with these will add to your enjoyment and will keep you on your toes trying to detect them. It will turn you into a name spotter.</p></body></html>

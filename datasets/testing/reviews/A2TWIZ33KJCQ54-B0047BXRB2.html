<meta name="summary" content="'THE FORBIDDEN PLANET' REPRESENTS THE TOP ECHELON OF SCIENCE-FICTION MOVIEMAKING IN THE 1950s"></head><body><p>EXCELLENT STORY BASED ON SHAKESPEARE'S "THE TEMPEST" ALSO BOASTS THRILLING EFFECTS,<br /><br />AT THE CORE -- THE SUSPENSE WILL KILL YOU -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ON ALTAIR-4!<br /><br />This very modern looking and well-made film stikes an emotional cord in many viewers and on multiple levels. To make this MGM classic Sci-Fi thriller from 1956 all the more convincing, there is an excellent cast and award winning special-effects, courtesy of Disney. We have love, rage and fear all playing at the same time and it is something to experience -- not just see.<br /><br />WHAT THE 'FORBIDDEN PLANET' IS ALL ABOUT -- [plot spoilers below]<br /><br />It's the 23rd century, and a United Planets Cruiser commanded Commander J.J. Adams [Leslie Nielsen] is on a rescue mission to the planet Altair-4. Apparently, the Earth spaceship Bellerophon vanished, 20 years earlier. The Bellerophon's destination was Altair-4. As we soon discover, there is only one survivor, Doctor Edward Morbius the ship's philologist.<br /><br />According to Webster's New World Dictionary a 'Philologist' is a 'Linguist', 'Scholar', 'grammarian' or 'lexicographer'. This is significant because what Morbius has discovered on Altair-4 will certainly need both a scholar and a linguist to unravel.<br /><br />Strangely and even rudely, Morbius wants no part of any rescue which of course makes Adams very suspicious and they land on Altair-4. What follows is what the film is all about.<br /><br />THE UNSEEN CAN BE VERY SCARY -<br /><br />As the story unfolds, with the help of excellent special effects, especially for 1956, we learn about the disposition of the rest of Morbius's lost crew and find that he has a daughter too. The two are all that have somehow survived some kind of "planetary force". As Adams and his crew remain to investigate and to await orders from Earth, that "planetary force" somehow returns to wreck havoc. If havoc isn't enough then perhaps some fatalities will get Adams to pack it in and scram.<br /><br />BUT WHERE IS THIS FORCE COMING FROM?<br /><br />Remember, I did say it was scary, it is, especially if you allow your imagination to run away a bit. As time goes by, the force becomes more determined [apparently] and Morbius becomes more disturbed. We learn of an ancient civilization called the Krell, that has become extinct and how this has been a source of major technological innovations that are now part of Morbius's household -- like 'Robby the Robot'. How did Morbius build Robby and what is it that we just don't see? There is a monster in this film and it is about as scary a monster as there ever was, literally indestructible and eternal.<br /><br />SO THE FORBIDDEN PLANET IS A MYSTERY TOO!<br /><br />Just what is this 'Planetary Froce', who controls it and what is the motivation for it is the mystery. As the film proceeds, the emotions: some of love, some of rage and some of frustration are building as they might within a pressure cooker. Here, the pacing of the film really helps to build the suspense, tension and fear. Yes, this can be a scary film. I thought so 50 years ago and still do today after hundreds of viewings.<br /><br />***** THE MAJOR PLAYERS *****<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon - Dr. Edward Morbius<br /><br />Anne Francis - Alta Morbius<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen - Commander John J.

Thankfully, this [widescreen VHS] version has them. One scene is not important and involves a pet monkey being shot with an electrical charge to keep him from eating a banana which was on the dining room table in Mobius's home. The other and more significant scene occurs during Morbius's little lecture, and show and tell session with Adams and Dr. Ostrow [Warren Stevens] in the underground Krell facility. The specific scene is where Morbius tells Adams to fire his blaster at the Krell metal. Adams does so and he and Dr. Ostrow are amazed to find that the metal isn't warm after being subjected to their weapon. I always felt badly that this scene was missing as it ties into what happens in the end by demonstrating how impervious Krell metal is to melting, even when fired at by 23rd century blasters [particle beam blaster].<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A TRUE SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT IS 5-STARS IN 1956 & 2006<br /><br />This is from beginning to end and very compelling film that has aged very well and is still chilling to watch. It is an excellent story, has a well played cast, modern effects and great pacing that leads to a dramatic conclusion.</p></body></html>

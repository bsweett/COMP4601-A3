<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the original and little more outlandish"></head><body><p>I loved the original Final Destination so I was naturally interested in how the sequel was going to turn out (interested enough to wait for it on video anyway). As I had expected, it wasn't as good as its predecessor, but in its own right, Final Destination 2 was entertaining at most. There are good things to say about this movie, but an equal number of bad things are to be said as well. First off, the opening death scene with the massive multiple car accident was just a wicked scene. My friends and me both watched with mouths and eyelids wide open. That scene was equally as good as the Flight 180 scene in the first. The following death scenes throughout the movie were all pretty good and left you on edge. I'd say the deaths in FD2 were much more elaborate, violent and more creative than those in the first. Besides that, I thought the plotline of the film started to get outlandish and muddy after the whole "Only life can stop death with the baby that was never to be born becuase her mother was supposed to be killed before its birth" .... And it seemed really funny to me when the characters would simply come up with complicated methods of surviving death after having a premonition. Overall, I thought it was a good entertaining and bloody movie, but it's outlandish story just makes the whole thing seem rather silly.</p></body></html>

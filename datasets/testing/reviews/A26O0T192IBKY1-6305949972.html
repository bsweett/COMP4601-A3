Based on his short story, Tim Burton brought back the concept of stop-motion animation with this in a way Gumby never did.<br /><br />Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, and he with his fellow bumpers of the night are in charge of Halloween every year, but totally unaware of any other holidays. After another successful trick-or-treat jamboree, Jack pines for something more to do with his life, and happens to stumble into a magic doorway that leads to Christmas Town, where Santa Claus runs X-mas. Jack falls in love with all things Christmasy, and decides to bring it back home. After doing some more research on it, he proclaims that he'll be the one running Christmas for that year. Everyone in Halloween Town gets on board with it, except for Sally, a Bride of Frankenstein-ish ragdoll girl who has a crush on Jack. Jack sends the trio of Lock, Shock, & Barrel to capture Santa so that he can replace him, but they take Santa to their boss, the slimey Oogie Boogie. Jack's attempt at being Santa totally backfires as he's shot down by the army. He realizes his mistake at trying to take over someone else's holiday, so he goes to get Santa back to save Christmas. Jack battles Oogie in his casino lair to free Santa, where its revealed that Oogie is really a pile of bugs. Santa manages to salvage Christmas for yet another year, and brings the holiday to Halloween Town. Jack then realizes his feelings for Sally, making for a happy ending.<br /><br />This is one of my absolute favorite animated films of all time. When it came out, I was getting out of animation for a while, but this totally brought me back into it. It also makes for a great refresher for the holiday season. As tough as it is to get through that time of year, watching Nightmare always makes it alot more tolerable, and from it you realize that if a skeleton from a horror-based society who knew nothing about Christmas could become a better person after finding it, then it shouldn't be too hard for all the real Scrooges out there either.</p></body></html>

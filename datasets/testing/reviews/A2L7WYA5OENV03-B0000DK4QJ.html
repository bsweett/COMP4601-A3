It's not very often we get true hardcore science fiction films here done with faithfulness, let alone ones that are executed in a revolutionary way.  This film looks like nothing you've ever seen before.  Using high-end film stock & lighting, the best in CGI, and special de-saturation of certain colors, the final result is a breathtaking and near seamless fusion of almost perfect technical moviemaking.  This is a new milestone in what's possible.  The only CGI that stood out was the one guy's missing eyes -- one of the sockets had that certain quality that the cafe owner's face in Attack of the Clones had.  But that is honestly it.  The processing of the film, in particular, has produced a look that is truly awesome!  Philosophically, acting-wise, the story...everything was far beyond my expectations, except for the ending.  Here's the problem: Spielberg's part of that Second Climax Club that loves to rebuild tension at the end.  This is one of the common traits of a Hollywood-ish film, something Spielberg should have been careful to avoid.  To make matters worse, he uses the clich&eacute;d "The Mentor is the Culprit" twist at the end.  The length of dialog exposition required to even relay this information (done over micro cell phones that look like jogging earbuds) makes the final scenes even more sloppy and conventional.  The film drags on just past a perfect end in the story, towards a more convoluted, less profound resolution.  AI had a much more exaggerated case of this problem, albeit also in a far less masterful film.  <p>There were three possible solutions to this: <p>(1) Have Cruise actually shoot the child killer; film over, no conspiracy. This would've been profound and artistically tragic.<p>(2) Have Cruise bring the child killer in; no conspiracy, but he's proven that pre-crime is flawed. This would have satisfied Spielberg's desire to contradict predestination.<p>(3) When I first heard of the film, I thought I knew how Spielberg would do it.  Obviously I was wrong, but my original idea is probably the best.  Since the precogs are hooked up to an imaging/victim-ID system and are themselves setting events in motions, then the big twist should have been that Agatha simply had a stray thought about Cruise committing a crime.  At that same moment she presciently saw a possible sequence of events where predicting the murder thereby caused it; the images of the crime appear on screen & the balls are encoded, thus setting said events in motion. After all, she already knew what he looked like and that he was a pre-crime cop, and everyone has random, uncontrollable stray thoughts from time to time.  It would be totally accidental and illustrative of the circular causality factor the human element introduces into the precognitive equation.  This would have been the most taught, profound, and intellectually satisfying twist possible in such a film.  Apparently I'm the only one who thought of it, though.</p></body></html>

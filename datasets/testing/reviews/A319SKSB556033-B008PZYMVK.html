<meta name="summary" content="Good and original..."></head><body><p>...but certainly not great. For a film that is as much arthouse as it is mainstream it makes no point at all whatsoever and it comes nowhere near taking advantage of it's wondeerful premise. All we get is a shaggy John  Cusack and a bushy Cameron Diaz going head to head over Catherine Keener  through John Malkovich. It does has the occasional weird charm but I feel  like it could have been so much more. Only a few scenes raised a smile in  me. <p>Don't get me wrong. I've never seen a movie that had so much  originality to it but I have also never seen a movie that did so little  with its ingenius idea. It becomes quite boring and saggy in places.  Whenever this happened I just wanted it to go to another scene where they  go inside John Malkovich.<p>Also...the ending makes no sense whatsoever.  And the writer doesn't even give an explanation for the portal or how it is  possible. This may have worked for Groundhog Day but just seems lazy here.  As you may have guessed the ending annoyed me very much. <p>I do reccomend  you buy this DVD but it should go in your Obscure/Hit-Miss section. The  film doesn't have much of anything to classify it as belonging to a certain  genre.<p>The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.85:1.</p></body></html>

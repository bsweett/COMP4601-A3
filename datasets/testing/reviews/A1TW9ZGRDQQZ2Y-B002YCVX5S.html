Unique, inventive, smart writing and excellent acting throughout are what first comes to mind when thinking about this film. Be warned, there is a lot of talking (the first scene is a 20 minute conversation), even for a Tarantino flick, but the dialogue is excellent and the characters are memorable. The only negative is that some scenes do drag just a little, but not enough to bore the life out of you. There are also some well crafted action scenes that are brutal, though they played a much more minor role than I expected.<br /><br />Brad Pitt turns in a fine performance and provides most of the comedic moments. Just don't expect him to be on the screen all the time. Unlike what you see in the trailers, he and his "Basterds" play supporting roles. There is no real leading role here, but one does take a commanding presence over all the rest. New to many people who will be watching this movie, Christoph Waltz delivers a performance to remember and will at minimum get nominated for an Oscar. He is clever, charming, slimy, unpredictable and evil. Expertly acted evil dudes seem to be cleaning up the supporting actor categories every year now. Javier Bardem won it for No Country for Old Men in 2007 and the late Heath Ledger did the same for the The Dark Knight in 2008. Why break tradition this year, especially given the complexity of Waltz's acting here. He already won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor award. The two main female actresses, Melanie Laurent (nomination worthy) and Diane Kruger, were both captivating and added the right elements this film needed. In fact, every person on screen seemed right for the role they were given. Well, horror director and buddy of Tarantino, Eli Roth, was a little off at times, but thankfully he has a smaller role and lets his baseball bat do most of the talking for him.<br /><br />Don't expect any historical accuracy, just get ready for a wild fantasy WWII movie that only Tarantino can pull off. His signature music and song selection is also some of his best. One thing is for sure, Quentin Tarantino is back on top in a BIG way.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

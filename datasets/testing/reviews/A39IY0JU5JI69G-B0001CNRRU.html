<meta name="summary" content="Impressive!  Ambitious!"></head><body><p>I was tempted to entitle this review, "Too clever by half" but I would have been guilty of the same....Another title that came to mind was "Needs Heart Transplant" but I rejected that for the same reason.<br /><br />On the positive side, most of the acting is superb.  Sean Penn is never less than great and he does not disappoint here.  Benicio de Toro's performance was beyond brilliant.  Naomi Watts was the weakest in my opinion. (I loved her in The Painted Veil.) She relied on looking pale and blank and tensing her jaw too many times to show any number of emotions and somehow I found her just blah.  She looks good, though, so men might overlook her pallor.  I think any number of other actresses would have done a better job. Kate Winslett and Julianne Moore both come to mind.  Melissa Leo, as del Toro's wife was perfect in her role.<br /><br />The story is smart.  It's full of thought provoking elements.  Perhaps too many to be digested in the space of one film.  This might be a good opener for a discussion group on any number of subjects:  addiction, religion, abortion, marriage, suicide, heart transplants, etc.<br /><br />That brings me back to "ambitious." There's nothing wrong with that, but I was so overwhelmed with the intensity of the content, that I numbed out, and by the end, I really didn't care about any of them.  Except Jack Jordan (del Toro's character) and his family.<br /><br />I found the technique of cutting back and forth in time more confusing than intriguing. As others have mentioned, it seems largely for the sake of being arty.  A little mercy for the viewer would have been welcome.  It did all come together, but too late in the film, for my taste, and by that time, I had stopped caring. If it had been filmed in a more sequential way, I think I would have been able to sustain my ability to  keep my heart open to these characters.  Also, the ratio of misery to joy was severely imbalanced, in my opinion and this had the effect of  numbing me.<br /><br />I agree with another reader who complained that the characters played by Penn and Watts were not fully written.  Penn's, especially.  He's portrayed as a real cold character, but when he gets the heart (transplant) of the good, famiy loving man, he warms up....but only to the widow of the dead man, not to his own wife, who wants desperately to stay in the marriage and have his child. Penn, by his natural humanity, makes us care about him, but that's a gift I think he gave to the script.<br /><br />The Watts character didn't hold together much for me.  She's portrayed as the loving wife, mother, sister and daughter, but then there is another, darker part of her that I think we should have seen earlier in order to make sense of her later meltdown.  True, she was given an enormous blow, but others have suffered similar things without resorting to drugs and murder.<br /><br />I have to give special mention to Jack Jordan, (del Toro).  The character is written with great depth and compassion and acted accordingly.  I was only going to give this film three stars but for that I add a fourth.  He is the one, troubled as he was, who comes through with the real heart.<br /><br />Another reader wrote that "the intricate screenplay isn't half as smart as it thinks it is" and I think he has a point.  It seems that the goal of the film is to impress.  If you want to be impressed, and don't mind being de-pressed in the bargain, then this might be the film for you.</p></body></html>

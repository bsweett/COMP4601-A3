<meta name="summary" content="Who contacts who"></head><body><p>This is another one of Spielberg's gems.See who actually made the contact,those shy aliens.Situations like this keep you guessing.But Spielberg was no fraud when it came to science fiction classic's.Would you have the guts to actually contact the alien,or perhaps get someone to do it for you.We would see then wouldn't we.Who has the answers huh,with all those advances those aliens had,they have nothing to fear.I dont think i would walk onto a spaceship with one,would you?<br />You should look into this,it's actually a great package.</p></body></html>

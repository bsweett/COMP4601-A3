<meta name="summary" content="Are you sure Kubrick made this film?"></head><body><p>This movie was just plain bad. I have seen basically all of Stanley Kubricks films, and unfortunatly his last was his worst. The story was just so wierd and twisted I didn't even want to finish watching the movie. With  all the hype this movie generated, and the actors in the movie, i thought  this would be great. Just turned out to be a stinker.<p>Hopefully Steven  Spielberg can do Kubricks other project AI some justice in the future, but  its unfortunate that this movie had to be so bad.</p></body></html>

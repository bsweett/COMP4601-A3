<meta name="summary" content="I liked it a lot -"></head><body><p>I probably would've liked it even more if it were 20-30 minutes shorter in the middle but as it is - great fun. Jack is back and he is magnificent -drunk most of the time, his morals as unstable as his walk, lying, seducing, running, hanging by his leg on the rope, and always irresistible. Depp's Capt. Sparrow is the reason to see the movie but there is so much more. The movie's last hour is simply awesome and the way its creators prepared us for the third film is very clever. I am happy that one of my favorite characters from the first movie made the appearance and will be the part of this trilogy (?) final(?) chapter. The film is exiting, has stunning special effects and I was sure that the make up artists would be nominated for all possible awards in the end of the year (they deserved them all). Well, I was wrong about make up artists but the movie has recieved the nominations for Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Sound and Sound Editing, and Best Achievement in Visual Effects and it is very fair. I will not mention the plot - it is there but it's not that important after all. The film is a rare case of equal opportunity entertainment and enjoyment - for the young children, their parents, cynical teenagers, sophisticated intellectuals, rednecks - for everybody and their uncle Max.</p></body></html>

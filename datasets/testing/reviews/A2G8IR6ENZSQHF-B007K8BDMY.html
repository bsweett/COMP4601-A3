Almost every negative review for the film I have read notes how crazy Treadwell was and thus how pointless this documentary is.  One reviewer even noted that he didn't learn anything new about bears, and thus the film was a failure.  These people are missing the point.  Regardless of your feelings towards Treadwell (I think he was a bit daffy myself), this is a fascinating and powerful character study of a tormented man.<br /><br />Such negative sentiments toward the film would be understandable if it were a hero-worship documentary, but I did not get that vibe from it at all.  Director/Narrator Herzog often voices when he disagrees with Treadwell, interviews people that had negative opinions of him (true, there are no right-wing nuts, but respected ecologists that disagreed with him are given their say), and at one point even says that Treadwell at times seemed overtaken with a madness (he says this during one of the movie's best scenes- Treadwell's rant against the actually effective park service).<br /><br />What makes "Grizzly Man" so good is that it is the study of a flawed human being that met an end so ironic that it almost seemed a higher power was at work.  Treadwell's attempts to communicate with the wild animals are both insane (touching bears on the noses, examining their feces) and touching (the friendships he seemingly develops with local foxes).  His constant ranting against the humans he sees as harming the bears make him unreasonable and unsympathetic, but he also has scenes where he is sympathetic and even likeable (when he laments his past alcoholism, explains his difficulties communicating with women, expresses his love for the wilderness around him).  We see both sides of Treadwell- the loving son and good friend, and the misguided wildman that dangerously habituated bears to the presence of humans.<br /><br />Ultimately, "Grizzly Man" is the compelling and sad story of a unique (or strange) person.  His inevitable end at the hands of the bears he so loved is both appropriate and sad (it is especially sad the woman who accompanied him was killed as well).  Herzog in making "Grizzly Man" put together a documentary that will remain the standard of great documentaries for years to come.  This was one of the best movies of the year.</p></body></html>

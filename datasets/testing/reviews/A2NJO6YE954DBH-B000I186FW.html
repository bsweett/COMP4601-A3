<meta name="summary" content="The subtleties of the graphic novel are replaced by really loud explosions"></head><body><p>Overall, I was definitely disappointed by "V for Vendetta," primarily because I was anticipating a really great adaptation of the work by writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd.  I was also looking forward to a movie that I would be able to use in my Introduction to Popular Culture class when it comes out on DVD because I thought it would be a nice example of how cinema functions rhetorically.  The idea that a masked figure who blows up public buildings could be a revolutionary hero rather than a murdering terrorist is a radical notion post 9/11.  But this film lacks the subtlety of the original graphic novel and makes a strategic error in foisting a conclusion to this dark tale.  The results are compelling, but not the provocative story I was hoping to see.<br /><br />After recapping the story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot for ignorant colonials, we cut to the future a couple of decades down the road where Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), is out after curfew in London.  She is about to be raped and probably killed by "fingermen" of the security forces when she is rescued by V, dressed in black and a Guy Fawkes mask.  He takes her to the roof top where he conducts a symphony that end with the Old Bailey blowing up.  They meet again when V takes over the single television channel to broadcast a promise that one year hence he will blow up the Parliament building (on Guy Fawkes day, of course) and asks that everyone in England who supports his cause to take to the streets that night to support his actions.  When Evey acts to protect V from the police, he takes her under his wing, and begins to educate her on his method and his madness. Meanwhile, Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) is put on the case but immediately hamstrung by the government from being able to investigate the clues that would lead to the identity of the terrorist.<br /><br />The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers turns Moore's attack on the conservative inclinations of the government of Margaret Thatcher into a more overt representation of a fascist government.  The insignia of this brave new world is a twisted version of the cross, and the fact that the person in charge is a chancellor recalls Hitler, as does the way the chancellor dresses.  Casting John Hurt, who played Winston Smith in the 1984 of "Nineteen Eighty-Four," as Adam Sutler, the fearless leader in this film only heightens the Orwellian analogy.  Moore and Lloyd had the evil men of the government look like ordinary bureaucrats, but this film stacks the deck so that the allusions to Hitler and "Nineteen Eighty-Four" are so obvious that of course our sympathies are with the terrorist blowing up the buildings (besides, they are not our buildings, they are English buildings; but more on that later).<br /><br />In the movie V speaks of the power of ideas and the importance of using words to persuade rather than coerce, but what really matters is blowing up buildings.  However, in the graphic novel the point was to blow up symbols.  The shift from having Big Ben be the first thing that V blows up in the book, to the total destruction of Parliament being V's ultimate goal, is rather significant.  V's final target in the book was 10 Downing Street and the final explosion is seen from the distance because the explosion is not the point.  It is the awakening political consciousness of Evey that is the soul of this film.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the film provides, in relative terms, a happy ending.  No political diatribe worth its salt is going to warn the masses of the evil inherent in the system and then provide an ending that reassures the audience that everything is going to be all right.  The graphic novel ends with a victory, but clearly the war will continue, for at least another generation.  The movie seeks to reassure us with a Rolling Stones song (and does not even bother to play the entire song).  Moore and Lloyd wanted to enlist us, following in the footsteps of Evey as she follows V, but the makers of this film would be happy if we pre-order the DVD after seeing the film.<br /><br />For most viewers it will be the way the films resonates against current events that will be the primary point of controversy.  Relatively few will have read the graphic novel, but far more people remember September 11th in the U.S. than the 5th of November in the U.K.  The idea of purging an English-speaking nation of Muslims, immigrants and homosexuals may or may not seem like something that can happen here.  Blowing up apparently empty buildings in the middle of the night and reserving the blood letting for situations where V gets up close and personal with the bad guys can certainly make this terrorist seem different and, dare we say, acceptable.  In the end we are so clearly distanced from this story that it does not ask us to make any hard choices.<br /><br />I would have preferred to see "V for Vendetta" as a television mini-series, not only because I think an episodic approach is better suited to telling the story, but also because it is a much more intimate tale that what we see on the big screen where they go out of their way to crank up the volume on the explosions.  Beyond that, the frozen face that is V's mask becomes a disadvantage both for Weaving and director James McTeigue.  There is only so much you can do with lighting and head tilts, and the first-time director relies too often on close-ups (no wonder James Purefoy bailed on the role).  "Sin City" set a standard for adapting a graphic novel to the screen that will probably never be approached by any one else, but I was hoping this one would be a lot closer to the mark.</p></body></html>

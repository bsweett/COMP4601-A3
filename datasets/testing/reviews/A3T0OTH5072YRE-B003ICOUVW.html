<meta name="summary" content="The Wolfman"></head><body><p>This remake of a classic doesn't at all do it justice.  While it hosts quite a few well-known actors, their superb playing cannot do anything for a plot that simply isn't there.<br /><br />Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) is returning to his childhood home upon the disappearance (and as he learns later death) of his brother.  Having not parted well with his father it is also a homecoming of sorts.  His father (Anthony Hopkins) is currently playing host to his brother's fiance Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) and it was she who let Lawrence know that his brother had gone missing.  Upon arriving he hears of his death and goes to look at the body, which is scarcely recognizable.<br /><br />Determined to find out what happened to his brother he bites off more than he can chew when he is attacked by the same creature.  Barely escaping with his life he starts to notice things are off when his wounds heal faster than normal.  Frightened that he too is becoming the werewolf told in the gypsy's folklore he has no time to do anything when his father has him shipped off to the insane asylum.  There he is subjected to a number of horrific tests and procedures.  He's not sure he will be able to endure it and is scared because in just a few days there is another full moon.  What will happen then?<br /><br />This movie could have been so much more with the cast of characters it provided.  As always, Anthony Hopkins, is delightfully creepy and does his role well.  However, the rest of the characters, no matter how good they could have acted, didn't have a chance with this movie.  The script just wasn't written well enough.  The dialogue was short and hardly had any substance to it.  There was nothing to make the viewer care for the characters.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent and I loved some of the scenes and landscapes that were featured in the movie.  While London was pictured as dark, it was more than made up for by the countryside of Lawrence's family home and the creek and woods surrounding it.  There was a fair bit of whimsy portrayed that probably was done with computer manipulation.  I do find fault with the way the werewolves were designed.  Surely for the stage of technology that is available they could have been done better.  However, to me they looked on par with the werewolves in some eighties or nineties movie.  The music to accompany this film was only so-so.  It did a good job of being instrumental and clashing at the suspenseful parts, but it was nothing fantastic.<br /><br />Overall I would only rate this movie average.  It neither was terrible nor was it something I would be eager to watch again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Watching Watchmen and the Anti-Heroes"></head><body><p>This is something of a review for the non-initiates. Meaning those that aren't slavish "Graphic Novel" fanboys. Not familiar with the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">Watchmen</a> comic book? Then some of the plot points are not going to make much sense. But as a quick summary, it's an alternate history about the 80's Cold War (summed up nicely in the opening credits). Nixon used a super-powered being to end the Vietnam War and overturn the rules about term limits. But now the world teeters on the brink of a US/USSR Nuclear Exchange, and masked vigilantes that used to fight crime have been banned. And now, one of these "Watchmen" is suddenly, inexplicably murdered.<br /><br />So now the Watchmen must risk breaking the law and exposing themselves to danger. Someone is trying to pick-off ex-heroes. Why...and is this connected to the buildup of international aggression? Can they stop the doomsday clock from the midnight of Nuclear Annihilation? The story is complex and often defies logic; no less a director than Terry Gilliam let the project slip from his hands as he described it as "unfilmable." Yet Zach Snyder (he of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300</a> fame) working from a script by David Hayter have fashioned a near three hour film that dazzles the eye but lurches and jerks to its finale.<br /><br />Snyder was a good pic for a few reasons; "300" was a visually stunning actioner that made up in scenery and motion what it lacked in coherence. However, 300 was a movie about heroes, "Watchmen" is one about anti-heroes. NiteOwl2 is more a Clark Kent than a superman, and Comedian is a nihlistic killer of women and children. SilkSpectre2 is the product of a rape. Rorschach is a paranoid sociopath who lost his conscience (and as played by Jackie Earle Haley, one of the things making "Watchmen" worth watching). Dr Manhattan (Billy Cruddup in motion capture gear), the one being among the Watchmen with any real superpower has power at the expense of his emotional clarity. There were a couple other fun casting decisions, like Matt Frewer (Max Headroom!) as Moloch.<br /><br />All these things are direct from the adaptation of the script, and it is hard to call this an adaptation, it barely defers from the book only once in any major way and that is near the end. There's too much going on here plus a boatload of dead-weight. Rorschach's voice overs get to be overbearing; he's a character better suited to the juicy toss-off lines like his scene stealing "I'm not locked up with you, you're all locked up in here with ME!" The violence is usually gratuitous and the sex oft-times seems inserted just to prove "Watchmen's" 'edginess' when editorial coherence would have been better. And for God's sake ENOUGH SLO-MO SCENES. What was innovative in 1999 with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0AQ">The Matrix</a> is now a lazy film-maker's cliche. It made a confounding movie to follow scream out about how clever it was without doing anything in service to the characters.<br /><br />Not the screaming failure of last summer's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD6FKI">Speed Racer</a> or the transcendent success of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVA">X-Men</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QC4">The Dark Knight</a>, "Watchmen" will be of passing interest to DC fans and the basement geeks that have been waiting 20 years for this particular movie to arrive. Casual viewers will likely leave the theater wondering what all the fuss was about.</p></body></html>

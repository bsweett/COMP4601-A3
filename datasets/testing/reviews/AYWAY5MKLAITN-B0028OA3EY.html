<meta name="summary" content="Superman Has Just Been Reborn On The Big Screen!"></head><body><p>Ever since Bryan singer left the highly anticipated X-men saga, people have wondered why he would leave such a successful series. But Bryan Singer heavily declared that reintroducing The Superman story has always been one of his lifelong dreams. (Just like Peter Jackson did with King Kong.)<br /><br />And his dedication in this film truly shows. Right from the getgo we are introduced to superman's nemesis Lex Luthor who is slowly plotting a plot to destroy superman and have his taste of victory once and for all. Follwoing that, Superman makes his entrance. But It's not your normal entrance. This Superhero's been gone for several years. And leaving Metropolis has taken it's toll on the citizen's. They now have learned to completely forget about superman and move on with there lives.<br /><br />(Just like in real life, audiences were secretly craving another superman movie but slowly moved on and thought that it wouldn't happen.)<br /><br />This time around, Lois lane has adapted her life completely Superman-free. That is, until, you know who starts flying around the town doing good deeds. You begin to realize that Superman is slowly rebuilding his status in Society and returning to what he does best.<br /><br />Replacing Gene hackman is Kevin Spacey, a perfect casting decision of course.<br /><br />Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a newcomer to the series and this is his debut film.<br /><br />Throughout the filme, you will notice that the special effects have been improved on massively compared to the 1978 version of the classic Superman. But Brandon routh doesn't feel like a simple replacment in my eyes. He looks and sounds just like christopher reeve which only brings more of a joy to the superman legacy of fans. Well done in casting, Bryan Singer.<br /><br />In this movie you'll find Drama, comedy, romance, thrills, chills, and shocks beyond compare.<br /><br />What I really, really, loved about this movie is it's close relationship to the fans and it's Christianized aspect.<br /><br />Not only is superman back and better than ever but the fans are overjoyed by the positive response. The movie even leaves room for a possible sequel. Oh, just a quick note, in order to fully comprehend when and where in the series this movie takes place, you must put Superman II completely out of your head.<br /><br />And, for a movie that lasts 2 1/2 hours, you'd think that it would drag but the good news is that it doesn't. Go See this movie and tell all of your friends!!<br /><br />Superman has just been reborn on screen!!</p></body></html>

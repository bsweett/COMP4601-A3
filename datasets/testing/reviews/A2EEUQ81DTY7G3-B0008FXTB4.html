<meta name="summary" content="An uneven film where Travolta, Thurman and The Rock standout"></head><body><p>Be Cool has been getting some terrible reviews, but it isn't really that bad. Yes - the move has some problems - it's about 30 minutes to long, it steadily loses focus towards the end, and some of the plot resolutions are not as imaginative as they could be - but in general, Be Cool offers some good laughs and is by and large an entertaining mish-mash of ridiculous and outrageous fun.<br /><br />Viewers don't need to have seen the first movie Get Shorty to appreciate Be Cool. This movie more than readily stands on its own, and continues the story of Shylock Chili Palmer (John Travolta) and his efforts to become an influential force in the music business. The movie begins with his best mate Tommy Athens (James Woods) getting violently gunned down by a helmet-headed Russian mafia hit man with a bad toupee. Tommy and his gorgeous wife Edie (Uma Thurman) ran NTL, a previously successful record label that has secretly been floundering. They have desperately needed a hit player.<br /><br />Chili visits Edie who is sun baking on the porch of a glamorous house, high in the Hollywood Hills. Chili tells her about Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a young singer who wants to be break into the industry. She's talented and gifted, but Linda is presently under contract with Raji (Vince Vaughn) and Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) of Car-o-Sell Records. Edie who obviously has a soft spot for Chili is more than willing to allow him adopt the role of music manager and court Linda. Edie also lets him protect her from the various scoundrels harassing her for Tommy's debts.<br /><br />Tommy died owing Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer) about $300,000, and now Sin is harassing Edie for the money. Sin, a wealthy and prosperous music manager, travels around Los Angeles in a collection of oversized Hummers threatening people with a posse of silver gun slinging rap stars called Dub MDs (including Andre Benjamin). Chili in an effort to "be cool" tries to play off the various sides and come out on top; he also wants to escape from the clutches of Raji. Raji, in turn, works with muscleman Elliot Wilhelm (a riotous The Rock). Elliot is a gay actor who Chili keeps pacifying with the promises of an audition.<br /><br />The story keeps pummeling along as each party tries to outwit and double-cross each other, but amongst all this Chili stays unruffled using his amazing powers of persuasion and influence to get his way. He confronts black gangland rap killers, a collection of mafia-like Russians who run a hockshop that masquerades for the headquarters of their criminal enterprise, while also managing to charm Steven Tyler (who looks strangely like Joan Rivers) from the rock band Aerosmith.<br /><br />It's obvious that Be Cool is a satire on the Los Angles music industry, and it generally succeeds. But most viewers will have had enough by the end of two hours and this viewer was thankful that it ended when it did. Travolta, Thurman, and The Rock are the main reasons to see this movie. They give the strongest performances, with the whimsical flirtation between Chili and Edie sustaining a good part of the picture. Their cute, innocent, and sexy dance together proves that they are the ones who own the movie. The Rock is also terrific as Elliot, proving once again that he is a man of many talents.<br /><br />Be Cool is entertaining enough and there are certainly some good chuckles and outright laughs along the way; there's also some good shots of Los Angeles, especially along Sunset Blvd and some nice aerial shots from high on the Hollywood Hills; but all too often the movie seems to go astray, wandering in search of the next funny moment or the next over-the-top scenario.

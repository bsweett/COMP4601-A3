Many people gave a sigh of disappointment since Ratner is less a director than more a "session player" that musicians use in the studio. What made the previous films work was that not only were they great comic book movies, they were just simply great movies with action scenes as well as some deeper issues and meanings. X-Men 3 became what the series shouldn't have been: a blockbuster and nothing more.<br /><br />The main inspiration for the film is the "Dark Phoenix" saga, arguably one of the most-well known and best sagas in Marvel's history. Jean Grey has been brought back to life after her death in X2 only she seems...changed. She seems a bit more uninhibited and carries a bit of a mean streak. Meanwhile, scientists at Worthington Labs have developed a cure of the mutant gene and are planning to allow willing mutants to take it and be "normal". Of course this infuriates Magneto and he establishes the Brotherhood, a group of mutants who are going to stop the cure no matter how.<br /><br />One complaint that's always been in the X-Men films is the sheer number of characters. Unlike the comics where you can actually do an arc on one character alone, here they jampack it with a whole bunch of characters that it's kind of overwhelming. In addition to X2's cast (besides sorely-missed Nightcrawler), we have Juggernaut, Callisto, Quill, Angel, Beast, Multiple Man and Kitty Pryde. Hell, I think they even added in Psylocke and some others not even mentioned. It ends up making an already big cast bloated. Not to mention certain characters react differently than before and an off-screen death is just inexcusable.<br /><br />The anticipated notions of an X-Men movie tend to be scenes exclusively related to a character. Whether it's fight scenes like Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike or the Nightcrawler attack on the White House, it's also geeky to see a scene of fights and mayhem. This film certainly has it from a small-but-cool cameo of a Sentinel to a big fight involving a house and the epic finale, it's certainly great to see things in a bigger proportion. Only problem is the scenes don't have an emotional resonance, it's just "time to see some computer-y stuff".<br /><br />If you manage to be a fan of this, is this worth buying? Depends if you want special features. All we have are alternate endings, deleted scenes and pat-on-the-back commentaries. If you're looking for some in-depth stuff, you'd best look to the eventual double-dip.</p></body></html>

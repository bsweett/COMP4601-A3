<meta name="summary" content="Spectacular tongue in cheek entertainment.."></head><body><p>Much too often i dont understand people and even more so the so called "professional critics". I went to see "Van Helsing" having read barrages of reviews describing it as anywhere between the disaster of all disasters or the joke to end all jokes. Knowing better than to trust critics i decided to risk 2 hours of my saturday night and i didn't regret it.<p>  Van Helsing is two hours of absolutely spectacular tongue in cheek entertainment. That's what it is, and anybody who's judging it on any other level than that is totally missing the point and will inevitably deprive himself of having fun with this cool flick.<p>  In a nutshell, Van Helsing is the guy to call when you've got trouble with some legendary monster. He arrives complete with his special tools and weapons and takes care of the gory business till the next job. From the opening sequence of the film when Helsing takes on a version of dr. Jekyll that looks more like an offshoot of the Hulk, you know you're in for some serious parody fun with loads of aces in the formula:<p>  the effects are truly stunning, but what makes the package even more attractive is the settings, the locations. Van Helsing's adventures take place in 17-18th century Europe, and the monsters are roaming all familiar cultural capitals like Paris or Vienna. The touch of the Eiffel tower being still under construction made me smile.<p>  But then the real plot kicks in and the opening sequence (which was by all means a treat) seems like peanuts.<p>  The exterminator is sent off to legendary Transylvania, where an all-star monster team is terrorising the locals, headed by Dracula and his flying-vampire brides (they totally steal the show of the first hour of the film) along with his army of genetic horrors, a stolen Frankestein with a partially blinking skull, Quasimodo who takes his orders directly from the King Vampire Himself, and of course, werewolves the kind of which i doubt you've seen in such form.<p>  Sounds like all this could be a mess to even attempt to tie into a "story"? Well, as far as I'm concerned, the scriptwriters did a great job of tieing all this together without insulting the audience, except for that part of the audience who insist stubbornly of treating this seriously. Those you can't satisfy anyway.<p>  Once these formalities are taken care of, and once you've understood on what level the premise of this film will work, the rest is a grand success really. The settings are even more impressive now, as the sky-piercing tower of Dracula appears together with the ultra-gothic village at the feet of his mountain which serves as a food source for him and his brides.<br /><br />  The effects jump to jaw-dropping levels by now, and this becomes a super-fun ride. Surprisingly, the nice touches here and there never cease appearing, as  the Dracula character is totally slick and very good with punchlines, while his brides have all the appropriate lines to qualify as high-flying, blood-sucking vixens of the highest order.<p>  I thought that by that time the wheels of the film should be about to fall off. It never happened though. "Van Helsing" keeps a frenetic pace through-out right to the very end, its parody feel is always there in perfect balance, and the overall result is actually very successful when you consider how badly this could've failed. <p>  To be sure, this film belongs in that category where you need to partly shut your brain off in order to enjoy it, but I'll tell you what: I've seen too many films lately where you're supposed to watch with your brain full-on and where the result was an utter joke. At least Van Helsing is totally honest with the viewer which is exactly why you can't possibly feel cheated afterwards, unless of course you want to. That's what some people would call bias (me included). <p>  The paradox of it all? That would be the fact that to make a film like Van Helsing work you need an intelligent film crew, especially that part of the crew involving the directing and the script-writting.<p>  One of the most fun films of 2004....</p></body></html>

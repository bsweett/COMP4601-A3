<meta name="summary" content="Worth Renting, But Not The Best From Harrison Ford"></head><body><p>One of my favorite actors, Harrison Ford, plays Jack Stanfield, the head of security at a bank.  When his family is kidnapped he is forced to help steal $100,000,000 from his own bank as a ransom for his family.<br /><br />Sounds like a part of nearly every season of Fox's 24.  This even includes Mary Lynn Rajskub as his loyal assistant Janet Stone.  Mary Lynn Rajskub coincidently plays Chloe on 24 who is the loyal computer geek at CTU.  On 24, Jack or another character often has their family or loved ones kidnapped and, with Mary Lynn Rajskub's help, will sacrifice anything in order to get them back (even millions of other people's lives if necessary).  So the entire time I'm thinking that Firewall is just a waterred down version of any 24 season.  It doesn't have as many plot twists and is nowhere near as entertaining as 24.  But you can watch it in less than 18 hours so there is a bonus!<br /><br />Don't buy this movie.  But it might make for a decent rental with family or friends (not young family, mind you).  There are a lot of idiotic things that happen so just take everything with a grain of salt.  Just remember that this is FAR from Harrison Ford's best movie.</p></body></html>

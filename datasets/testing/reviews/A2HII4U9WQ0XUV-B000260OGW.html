Look at me!", so unwilling to trust the audience, that I was surprised Costner didn't include a little blonde kid yelling "Shane! Come back, Shane!" at the end of this indulgent, ponderous, plodding snorefest.<br /><br />Costner's heart is obviously in the right place, and it's evident that he intended "Open Range" as a salute to the great classic western movies and as a memorial to the passing of the Old West.<br /><br />But Costner should know by now that the best movie cowboys are laconic, silent, drifting types who shoot the bad guy and gallop into the sunset---not self-conscious weepy fellows who break into full-bore confession mode at the drop of a ten-gallon hat.<br /><br />Be warned: this is not your father's Western, this is Oprah's Western. Costner has used "Open Range" as an expansive pallette by which he has, subversively and possibly unwittingly, taken the traditional Old West tale and turned the entire genre on its head, with an insidious result.<br /><br />With that in mind, let's ride out, pardners:<br /><br />THE BASICS: Boss Spearman (played nicely by Robert Duvall) and his partner Charlie Waite (Kevin Costner, who, much like Woody Allen, enjoys directing himself) are cowboys who herd cattle and horses across the prairie. They are 'Open Rangers', men who let their livestock graze anywhere and don't pay for the privilege.<br /><br />This doesn't sit well with town magnate Denton Baxter (played with scene-chewing fury by Michael Gambon), who uses his toadies and henchmen to terrorize Spearman's team, killing one man, wounding another, and even shooting their dog. Someone's gotta pay!<br /><br />THE GOOD: Costner likes his Western settings, and for the most part he has a great eye for the exteriors, the landscapes: relatively new cinematographer Jimmy Muro captures some stellar long-shots of the high prairie that echoes the mindscape of its free-grazing wanderers. When "Open Range" works, it works in spades: the casual, friendly banter between the Open Rangers comes off as completely authentic, though I was sad we didn't get more of Abraham Benrubi(Mose), who reminded me of Dan Blocker's "Hoss" from 'Bonanza'.<br /><br />Robert Duvall's Boss Spearman is a fine, grizzled, well-developed character, and at this point in his career Duvall could act in his sleep. Costner is competent but, oddly, sleepwalks through his role, and talks to love-interest Annette Bening like he had just gotten off the confessional talk-show circuit. The gunfight woke me up, and was surprisingly visceral, realistic, and shocking.<br /><br />Gambon does a fine job as the Irish town boss and manages to out-Albert Finney Albert Finney. It's nice to know we'll be seeing more of him as Dumbledore in the "Harry Potter" series. And it's always nice to see more of the incomparable Michael Jeter (who plays the film's puckish hostler Percy), who died shortly after the film completed shooting.<br /><br />THE BAD: At just under three hours, the film is sleep-inducing. This is a good movie if you need to quickly excuse yourself: you can leave, go to the bathroom, get some popcorn, and come back without having missed much more than interminable dialogue. "Open Range" needed to say less, and do more.<br /><br />Annette Bening is competent and struggles with the thankless role she's given, though her character, and the ensuing romance with Costner, is completely unbelievable. Let's see---Bening's Sue Barlow has medical training, is a pretty woman, and lives in a fine house, and yet she has to apologize for being "too old" to woo Costner, a stinky drifter with violent hallucinations and no aim in life?<br /><br />THE UGLY: Apart from its snore-inducing pacing, "Open Range" manages to turn the Western on its head. When you think of good westerns (from Peckinpah to Ford to Huston to Eastwood), you get the loner, the individual whose integrity and fighting spirit propel him to avenge injustice and evil against nearly insurmountable odds.<br /><br />But "Open Range" is about four guys who graze their horses on someone else's property, which to my mind is illegal and shiftless. They get in trouble with the law, and come to town to settle a score.<br /><br />But wait---unlike Gary Cooper's lonesome sheriff in "High Noon", Costner and Duvall have plenty of allies, and have what feels like an hour to set up an ambush for the 'bad guys'---heck, they even have time to eat chocolate, chat up the townsfolk, and smoke cigars before the final confrontation!<br /><br />Worse yet, after Costner strides into the midst of the understandably panicked bad guys, sixguns blazing, the rest of the town gets in on the act (why?), chasing Gambon's henchmen around and executing them like Czarists in the 1916 Russian Revolution.<br /><br />As a result, Costner and Duvall and their allies actually *outnumber* the ostensible villains, which scuttles any suspense and is also pretty repulsive; far from being sympathetic, the fickle and vengeful townsfolk are some of the most horrifying creatures ever to appear in a western.<br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY: If a cowboy strides up to you, gun in hand, and growls "are you the one who killed our friend", and you intend to smile and say 'yes'---well, be damned certain you have your six-shooter out.<br /><br />With a good editor and about an hour cut from the film, "Open Range" would have been a tight and fairly focused film. As it is, the movie is poorly paced and boring. Circle your wagons and spend some quality time with a classic, like "Unforgiven" or "High Plains Drifter", instead.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

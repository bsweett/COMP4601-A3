<meta name="summary" content="Broken Flowers  ~ Jim Jarmusch"></head><body><p>Broken Flowers~ Jim Jarmusch is a parody of American life and shows the "crazy" animal communicator, the rich and stiff upper class, the redneck family and the white trash family. Bill Murray perfectly plays the role of the old millionaire, living in his dark mansion. The women that he meet to find his son are all meant to show a portrait of America. First we get to meet Laura and her daughter Lolita (whom tries to get him in bed with her from the first scene and in one scene walks around completely nude talking on her cellphone). The second woman that he meets, Dora, is supposed to be the upper class wife whom lives in an " antiseptic McMansion" and the food they eat is a riot. it is rice, some fish and some carrots and they are all made in an "artsy" yet "clean" way. The other two women also show a portrait of the American, Carmen (the quirky pet comunicator) and Penny (the redneck woman). The movie does not miss anything like small details such as the expensive dog treats at Carmens place, the "beaded" cell phone of Lolita (Yes, she plays the same role as in Nabakov, and I started chuckling to myself when she mentioned her named), the piles of rusted cars in Pennys frontyard and many other details that desribe America in a nutshell. I love this movie and would warmly recommend it to anyone that loves well made movies.</p></body></html>

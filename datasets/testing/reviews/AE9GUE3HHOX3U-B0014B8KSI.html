<meta name="summary" content="Michael Creepy"></head><body><p>I was relieved in reading some other reviews that I'm not the only one who thinks this film was plain and ordinary, and bordering on "bad".  I really wanted to see this, the previews made it look so interesting.  The story and some of the acting came off as very creepy.  The performance of Tom Wilkinson made me feel nervous and edgy, not a good feeling.  The way "Michael Clayton" was filmed also gave me a feeling of disconnect, with the pale colours and drab scenery, more creepiness.  You can't deny the good acting by Tom Wilkinson, George Clooney and Tilda Swinton.  That is why I gave it 3 stars but I just couldn't get through the whole movie, I turned it off towards the end.  I guess I'm not into all the government conspiracy, spying, survalence type movies like this and "Bourne Ultimadum".  It's not entertainment in my oppinion.  I did like "Breach".  That should have been nominated for academy awards, not this.</p></body></html>

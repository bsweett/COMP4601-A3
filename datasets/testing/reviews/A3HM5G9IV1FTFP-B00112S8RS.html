<meta name="summary" content="Taking family dysfunction to a whole new level"></head><body><p>It's almost Shakespearean the way family drama and dysfunction escalates into violence, death and ruin in this film. The best thing about this film is, by far, the performances. Powerhouses like Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Albert Finney, and Marisa Tomei expertly portray their duplicitous, grasping, and broken characters, finding the humanity underneath their amoral behavior. The editing and time-shifting are occasionally clumsy, but the acting more than makes up for it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This movie is an abortion"></head><body><p>This movie is as pointless as two squirrels screwing in a wool sock.<br /><br />First of all, it's not scary.  Neither the plot nor characters provide any real "horror".  In fact, Toy Story was slightly scarier than The Grudge.  Simply because there are a few shock scenes, in which the main device to shock is a sudden change from very quiet to very loud, does not make a horror movie.  What's more, it sure doesn't make a good horror movie.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar gives a lifeless performance as the lead.  I suspect that for this abomination of acting she'll be lashed until she drops, never to receive a lead role again in which she doesn't show full frontal nudity.  The only way she'll be investigating any more deaths is in a Scooby Doo sequel.<br /><br />Oh my!  There's a person in the attic.  Wow!  There's a mute, old woman.  Watch out!  There's a little Japanese kid meowing like a cat.  It's simply people walking from one dark room to the next, being confused by whatever nonsense could be imagined without rhyme or reason.<br /><br />It is incomprehensible, boring, lame, and predictable.  If it weren't for the director's well-placed jump scenes, strategically selected to shake-up an entire audience of people in full REM, this movie would be perfect for someone with terrible insomnia.</p></body></html>

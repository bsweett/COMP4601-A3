<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Follow Up"></head><body><p>First, I want to say that this review is for the movie and not the box. I hate it when you read a review and some idiot starts out by reviewing the damn box the movie came in. I guess if I dropped a turd in a cute little box and sealed it up good that's enough for a 5 star review. Give me a break!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the original Iron Man more the 2nd time around. I started the sequel but never finished it. I recently came back to it with a fresher perspective and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, the sequel pits Iron Man against 3 foes: a vengeful Russian named Ivan (Mickey Rourke), a rival battle-suit maker played by Sam Rockwell, and finally himself as the hardware in the middle of his chest supporting his body is going bad. The story was decent enough for the world that this film takes place in. The action scenes and special effects were well done. If I had a choice between Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard I'd take Howard only because I believe that his charisma matches up with Downey's.<br /><br />This film was definitely not as good as the first film in the story department but the action was as good if not better. And I think the film set up next year's Avengers movie well. I wonder if the Hulk's going to be in that film? Anyway, like I said, Iron Man 2 is a good, not great, sequel and if you go into it with realistic expectations you will like the film.</p></body></html>

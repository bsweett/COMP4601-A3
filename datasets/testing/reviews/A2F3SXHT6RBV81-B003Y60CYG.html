<meta name="summary" content="The Mystery of Radio, Luxury of Music."></head><body><p>Marylou Burke was in this film along with Garrison Keillor and Kevin Kline, portraying the last radio broadcast of Prairie Home Companion.  Backstage at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, the movie starts as we see Mr. Keillor with his pants off.  As the program starts on WLT, G. K. has on the longest red tie I ever saw.  Nobody's perfect.<br /><br />The real mystery is taking place as the show is on the air.  What happened to Chuck while his record was playing?  The death of an old man is no tragedy.  He'd left Evelyn behind who wailed, "I don't want him to go."  She was advised to forgive his shortcomings.  It doesn't seem right without Chuck -- what you got going on here?  There's always that damn doubt and disappointment doesn't get you anywhere.  Like a man tends to do, the cast are told that life is a struggle anyway, to just ignore bad news and it will go away. Is that rational thought? It's time to integrate all sides of your psyche and bring your intuition, emotions and physical body into play too.<br /><br />The Johnson sisters are has-beens left from a singing religious family and bad, bad.  Things tend to fall apart.  It was a revelation for both of us.  He had no idea what happened.  We had a situation here with no resolution.<br /><br />Radio gives shy persons the strength to get up and do what needs to be done.  A good voice is a necessity for a broadcaster.  Lois, the blonde angel of death dressed in a white trench coat, had come for Chuck but also enticed Carl Gardner, played by Tommy Lee Jones, to take her to the airport on a short cut.  She'd told G. K. "because of your story, I died."  There can be no silence on radio, and the dead air is filled with stupid "ad" spots as Cindy explained which don't have to be accurate as they just serve a purpose -- thus, the mystery of radio where anything goes.  We don't look back, but the luxury was the music.<br /><br />A man was the cause of it all.  The damn carpet reminded G. K. of an island full of palm trees and azure skies.  A place called Paradise, short term.  He does have a way with words.  Duct tape won't make an honest man out of you.  It was great fun and Garrison Keillor was fantastic playing himself matter-of-factly, not bigger than life, as he appears on the radio every week one place or another.  He came to Knoxville and wrongly called it a Presbyterian town -- not so, it is a drinking town.<br /><br />Lois had told G. K. that the characters on his Wobegan show seemed like "my friends" and I was the one who has loved you so true.  He just went away.  After the bad (risque) jokes by the cowboys, things went down the drain.  Just something happened, right?  It didn't change a thing and she decided not to press charges.  For now.  Actually, it was the end of everything when the Angel returned and kept them guessing who's next.</p></body></html>

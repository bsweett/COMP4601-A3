Things get a little complicated when a type of family curse threatens to ruin everyone's sanity...<br /><br />Rumor Has It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston, Mark Ruffalo, Kevin Costner, Shirley MacLaine, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Rumor Has It is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classic Suspense Flick That Should Be Seen By All Movie Lovers"></head><body><p>I waited a long time to watch the classic film JAWS because I always heard it was so scary and full of gore.  I finally watched it this week and though the movie did make me jump a couple of times  the images of blood and guts are about the same if not milder than what you would see on a typical CSI episode.  The film is a true landmark in the horror genre  mostly because the three main characters (the marine biologist, the police chief and the shark hunter) are so well developed with complete back stories and very well portrayed by fine actors.  The plot of the story is rich in themes that go well beyond the man vs giant toothy sea monster we usually think of when someone mentions the film JAWS or hums the trademark theme song.  JAWS has truly earned a lasting position in our popular culture.</p></body></html>

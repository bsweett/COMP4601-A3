<meta name="summary" content="It's a scream!"></head><body><p>"Monsters,Inc" is one of PIXAR's cleverest creations. It's about the Cyclopean Mike (Billy Crystal) and the shaggy Sully (John Goodman) whose career is to make children scream, keeping Monsteropolis powered. They collect children's screams. However,their city is having an "energy crisis" since children aren't as easily scared. Sully has been employee of the month--but the jealous salamander Randall (Steve Buscemi) will do anything to get ahead. Then,a little girl named Boo scares Monsterpolis... On the way, Sully develops paternal feelings for Boo,and it's learned that the monsters fear children.<br /><br />"Monsters,Inc" has plenty of in-jokes--from the Harryhausen's sushi bar to an opening like "The Right Stuff." It's a clever,poignant movie. Mike is delightfully neurotic,thinking up that he'll release the little girl to the outside world "using mostly spoons." Sully goes from scaring children to making them laugh. There's a brief,hilarious segment with the Abominable Snowman in the Himalayas with his sno-cones.<br /><br />"Monsters,Inc" was better than I expected. I thought it would be sappy,childish fare. Instead,it'll have you laughing and thinking! It's fit for the whole family.</p></body></html>

The cast is superb, the pace - incredible; 145 minutes simply flew by. My beloved "Sopranos", all six seasons of it could fit perfectly like in a case in these 145 minutes. Ultra-violent, mesmerizing, enthralling, "GoodFellas" is an unforgettable wild ride. I have not seen the film for a while and what a great fun it was to re-watch it again and I know it always will be.<br /><br />Favorite scene - after Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) killed Billy Batts, they and Henry Hill stopped at Tommy's mother (Mrs. Scorsese) house. The contrast between earlier horrifying scene at the bar and the nice family dinner is simply breathtaking.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not a Bad King adaption"></head><body><p>Stephen King has gotten some really bad adaptions (and you stinkers know exactly who you are ) and some decent ones, tv strangely enough.  This one isn't too bad though I agree with those who say the changed ending ruins the ambiquity of King's original tale. Tom Jane turns in a decent enough performance, interesting CGI. Not a bad one to watch on a Saturday night.</p></body></html>

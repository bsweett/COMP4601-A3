<meta name="summary" content=""It's a complete disaster!""></head><body><p>THE CORE (2003) is a sci-fi "disaster-ecological-threat" film that is a perennial favorite of mine. While it is fairly straightforward as a plotline (we buggered the earth's core, made it stop spinning, disasters ensue, will get worse, geniuses try to fix it, take ship to center of the earth ... you know) the effects are splashy and the talent is "thick on the ground" as they say.<br /><br />Let's skip the usual details and leave it like this: star power includes the ever-wonderful Aaron Eckhart as the geophysicist who seems to hold a million degrees and helps save the day. Hilary Swank is the Air Force pilot who pilots the Salvation Ship (it's my nickname for the inner-earth vessel "VIRGIL"). Stanley Tucci is the Great Physicist-All-Around-Know-It-All, and the wonderful, charming Delroy Lindo is Dr. Ed Brazzleton, who I name because he's the coolest of them all. He's the guy who is directly responsible for the ultimate saving of the earth.<br /><br />D. J. Qualls is the hacker who is employed by Uncle Sam to assist. The legendary Richard Jenkins is the modest, brave general who heads up the military end of stuff. Bruce Greenwood, yet another super-great but not quite superstar, is the other ship's pilot. The underrated and under-credited legend Alfre Woodard is the plucky project director, and last but never least is the great Tch&eacute;ky Karyo (this film is packed with favorites of mine) as a pointless but colorful French scientist.<br /><br />Yes, the rest is a matter of taste. Yes, the film's derivative, to say nothing of its disgustingly obvious plot-hole. Yes, much of it seems to have been thought out in a backward fashion - but it isn't bad for all that. It is far better than, say, SPHERE or about equal to THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (another favorite of mine). It is loads better than ARMAGGEDON and DEEP IMPACT.<br /><br />If you have never seen it or seen it only once, get it: it is worth having as opposed to not having, and it is funny. It never takes itself too seriously and I was most impressed by the fact that the politics are tongue-in-cheek or just outright missing. In one important scene, Karyo, chuckling, says loudly, "It's a total disaster!"<br /><br />You can't say that about any of the other comparable disaster films, which are usually complete disasters.</p></body></html>

This movie started out as a bunch of people, very few, who are left in the world as the dead have apparently inherited the earth. The rich live in mighty sky scrapers while the poverty stricken masses are huddled at the bases. Then, as if by some weak giveaway that they were running out of ideas, one character demands that he be let into the rich buildings or he'll blow them up. Not only that but he wants money. And a lot of it. Quick question: What's the point of asking for money when the dead have taken over the earth?!!!!</p></body></html>

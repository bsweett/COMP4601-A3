<meta name="summary" content="nothing but 'rambo' mayan style"></head><body><p>this is a very good movie. very concentrated and intense. but when you watched the storyline unraveled, you  might have suddenly realized that you were watching the renewed 'rambo' from the '80s. even the fighting scenes, chasing sequences and the outcomes were almost the same. this is a well directed movie. forget about other viewers' yadayadayada, don't go too deep and try to interpret the meaning, historical or not, mel gibson or what. don't bother. just take it easy and watch it as an action packed, well developed, well directed, edited and most of all, well performed thriller. chopping heads, digging out hearts, mel gibson just threw the whole 9 yards to you, if you think it's too gross, too bloody, too cruel, just walk out and walk away. ever remember 'if you can't stand the heat, just get out of the kitchen'. this is what you have to remember all the time.<br /><br />why you have to burden yourself and try to seek anything meaningful out of every movie you've watched.<br /><br />this is just another version of 'rambo' in a different background, that's all.<br /><br />and, by the way, if mr. gibson likes it, he could develop this movie into a 007 or mission impossible like franchise, let the hero fight another day against the spaniards as a sequel, who knows.</p></body></html>

Briliant film about truth of the Diamond trade in Africa.  I am always leary about watching this kind of film, thinking it may just be some hollywood producer with a politcal chip on their shoulders, but this movie is really well done and the performances are great. Leonardo Decaprio does well and deserves his Oscar Nomination, but his performance is Honestly dwarfed by Djimon Hounsou, who in my book steal the show and of the two of them will be the one holding the statue at the end of the day.  The movie is very graphic and violent, so be forwarned.  Definite movie to see. unfortunately, I don't know if even a penny from seeing it will go to remedy the situation it was written about, thats the only drawback I see, but it will make most think more than twice before looking at a Diamond and its credentials.</p></body></html>

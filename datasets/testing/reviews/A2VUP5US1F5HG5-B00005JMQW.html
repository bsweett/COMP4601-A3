<meta name="summary" content="SPIDER-MAN SWINGS BACK INTO ACTION!"></head><body><p>Following up on a successful film--especially a runaway blockbuster like the original SPIDER-MAN--is always a risky undertaking, and one which frequently falls flat. Fortunately director Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and company are up to the challenge in SPIDER-MAN 2, the rare sequel to live up to its predecessor. When ambitious scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into a metal-tentacled man-monster in an experiment gone awry, even J. Jonah Jameson knows Spider-Man is the only one who can stop him. Or can he? And as if the rampaging Doctor Octopus isn't enough, everyone's favoite Wallcrawler must also contend with the generally grisly ups and downs of everyday existence as he struggles in vain to hold together something resembling a normal life as Peter Parker: his grades are slipping, he can't hold on to a job, best friend Norman Osborne obsesses over Spider-Man's demise, he's on the brink of losing Mary Jane forever to no less than Jonah Jameson's son, and even his relationship with his beloved Aunt May suffers. It's all enough to make even a hero consider throwing in the towel. But if Peter Parker isn't Spider-Man, then who is he?<br /><br />  This is a tremendously exciting movie, with great stunts and special effects and the battles between Spider-Man and Doc Ock are a wonder to behold. But like the first Spider-Man flick, the sequel goes beyond the action and spends a lot of important time building characterization with all the leads. The characters in this movie are not just punching bags. They are real people with real-world problems and there are no easy answers. The script is literate and well-crafted, with the theme of identity/self-discovery skillfully interwoven throughout. Though it is a much more serious film than many comic-book adaptations, there is some nice comic relief and the sense of wonder never wavers.<br /><br />  One reason for the success of the Spider-Man films is great casting. Tobey Maquire is of course letter-perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, capturing the essence of the iconic Everyman superhero flawlessly. Kirsten Dunst is an excellent Mary Jane as well, and in some ways her portrayal of the character is more likeable than the one in the comic book. And Alfred Molina hits Doc Ock dead-on, bringing one of comicdom's great villains to devastating life just as effectively as Willem Dafoe did the Green Goblin. Many forget that for several years Doctor Octopus was Spider-Man's number-one enemy dating back to Spider-Man #3, when Doc Ock was the fist villain to beat Spider-Man head-to-head (temporarily, of course), but no one will doubt his status in Spider-Man's rogues' gallery after seeing this movie!<br /><br />  The only real complaint I have with this film is that Doctor Octopus's character is drawn much more sympathetically than in the source comic, though his personal crisis does parallel Peter Parker's own quite nicely.<br /><br />  Whether or not it's equal or better to the original in every respect, SPIDER-MAN 2 is highly entertaining cinema that most fans will love. The adventure, drama, and romance are all exceptionally well-done, and SPIDER-MAN 2 is certainly one of the best superhero movies ever made.</p></body></html>

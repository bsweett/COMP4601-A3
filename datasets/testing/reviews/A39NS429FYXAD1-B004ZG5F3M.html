<meta name="summary" content="Sweet, delicious fantasy for grown-ups."></head><body><p>A perfect international cast comes together for this wonderful fable that will keep you enrapt for 2 hours.  Delightful performances, thoughtfull design and sensitive direction along with a charming score make this one to view more than once.<p>The Bonus features are less than thrilling and the Producer's commentary is hardly insightful or revealing.  It might have been more fun to have some of the cast members offer their recollections and observances than the producers who seemed to be more set on espousing facts from the press release.</p></body></html>

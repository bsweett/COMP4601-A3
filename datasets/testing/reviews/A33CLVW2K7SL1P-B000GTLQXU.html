<meta name="summary" content="Real tension, great effects, but little else"></head><body><p>This film suffers in comparison to others, namely the "original", and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANVQ0K">Titanic</a>. One wonders at the wisdom of greenlighting this project and approving a budget of $160 million. That question becomes more relevant during the opening credits. Not to disrespect either actor, but Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss are past their A-list days.<br /><br />Not only does POSEIDON suffer in comparison to other films, it suffers from filmmakers more concerned with a visual product than any other components. For main characters, we're given a group that you could pluck down in just about any thriller and watch them run with little or no guidance: in other words, they're stock characters. We've seen them hundreds of times: the former fire-fighter turned Mayor turned wealthy gambler, the former navy guy who can navigate his way through a ship that's turned upside down with remarkable pinpoint accuracy, the gay man with a can't-miss-it-sized earring in his right ear who's there just to be gay, a single mother with a young cute son who makes endearing comments and looks just so, the mayor's daughter who is nervous around him for no apparent reason, and the guy who wants the mayor's daughter to marry him who calls him sir. Nothing new here.<br /><br />What was surprising, however, was that the filmmakers approached POSEIDON with a take-no-prisoners attitude. Everyone's life was up for grabs, and I mean everyone's. They killed off one of their initial main characters almost immediately, and that set up the possibility of real tension. Without having done that, this film would have been a waste.<br /><br />But a film can't build a reputation by having great special effects and killing people indiscriminately. It needs a story, a plot, people that we care about so that when they die we care...and this just didn't have it.<br /><br />2? stars.</p></body></html>

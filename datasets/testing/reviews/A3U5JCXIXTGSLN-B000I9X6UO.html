<meta name="summary" content="Seeking Truth"></head><body><p>Phone Booth is an incredible pshychological drama in which Colin Farrell plays a shady publicist who learns a lesson about telling the truth and respecting people and their feelings when he steps into a phone booth in New York City and begins a long, scary conversation with a sniper. This sniper is ready and willing to shoot Farrell's character as well as anyone who gets in the way.<p>This is an excellent drama about how telling the truth can impact, and change, a person's life in so many ways. Colin Farrell, Forrest Whitaker, and Keifer Sutherland give great performances in this film.<p>I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat the entire time!</p></body></html>

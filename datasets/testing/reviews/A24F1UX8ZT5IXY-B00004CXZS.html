<meta name="summary" content="Montalban steals the film from Shatner and company."></head><body><p>What makes Star Trek 2 truly exceptional is the menacing, scene-chewing villainy of KHAN himself. This character, and Motalban's performance, saved the Trek franchise from oblivion.<br /><br />For me, the greatest sequence of the film is Khan's introduction on Cetti Alpha 5. He is absolutely magnetic, as you watch him piece together the entire sequence of events in a brilliant work of exposition. James Horner does a wonderful job of culling themes from the old series to underscore the drama. From this point on, the film jumps to life whenever Khan is on screen.<br /><br />As for the rest of the plot -- it's vintage Trek, a tad earnest, but solid. The infamous scene at the end is very well played, but becomes a bit over the top with Amazing Grace pumping etc. Nicholas Meyer's tendentious sentimentality and curt dialogue, Moby Dick references and the rest make for fast-paced, snappy scenes but frequently lapse into hokum. See "The Undiscovered Country" for much worse abuses.<br /><br />But to get back to Khan for just a moment. For any fan of "The Space Seed" is bound to be disappointed. In that 50-minute episode Khan is given about twice the screen time that he is here. The entirety of his background, his temperment, his psychology is delved into. He has some magnificent clashes with Kirk and turns a woman into a simpering slave. In Star Trek II, Khan and Kirk do not even confront each other in person. This is a major disappointment.<br /><br />Yet I give the script credit for taking a situation directly out of the Trek universe and turning it on its head; Kirk finally cannot cleverly escape the clutches of a determined enemy. Khan is too unrelenting; he is the engine of this film.</p></body></html>

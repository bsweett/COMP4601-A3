It suffers however from mostly pedestrian acting performances and often uneven plot.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, the mastermind of a elaborate heist in Venice of $35 million of gold bullion.  His team is bolstered by his mentor and father figure John Bridger, a career thief played by Donald Sutherland.  The brilliantly conceived plan goes off without a hitch however team member Steve played by Edward Norton decides to double cross Wahlberg. He kills Sutherland absconding with the gold and is convinced that he's also terminated the remainder of Wahlberg's crew.<br /><br />The film then turns into a tale of retribution as Wahlberg who does little more than flex and smile recruits Charlize Theron, Sutherland's daughter Stella who is a high tech security expert and safecracker, to join his crew.  Even the talented Norton fails to deliver a notworthy acting performance and computer geek Lyle played by Seth Green steals the show with his performance.<br /><br />The action including an excellent car chase scene featuring a trio of Mini Coopers roaring through gridlocked Los Angeles streets is unrelenting.  The plot suffers from a lack of imagination when the scheme to recover the loot from the villainous Norton utilizes the same mechanism used in the original theft.</p></body></html>

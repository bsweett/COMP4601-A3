I love the John Waters version and I dreaded watching something that just might not be as strong and well done as that movie was.<br /><br />I was wrong. This musical rocks!<br /><br />Hairspray takes the plot of the John Waters movie and turns it into a musical with heart and soul. You feel compassion for Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) who plays the "fat girl" who gets her guy Link Larkin (Zac Efron) after all. We follow Tracy and her friend Penny as they are growing up in Baltimore in early 1962. Tracy wants nothing more than to dance on a local TV record hop show called The Corny Collins Show. Of course, Tracy gets her wish--and she gets noticed by Link who gradually comes to feel quite amorous for Tracy. Love blossoms again when Tracy's friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) falls in love with an African American young man named Seaweed (played so well by Elijah Kelley).<br /><br />As the romances evolve we also watch Tracy get involved with the integration movement and Tracy even participates in a protest march to the TV station where The Corny Collins Show is under strict segregation. Look for a stunning performance by Queen Latifah as the incredible Motormouth Maybelle, a black woman who is understandably angered when the one day blacks are allowed on The Corny Collins Show gets cancelled.<br /><br />The movie is peppered with strong, perky and thoroughly enjoyable musical numbers all of which work marvelously. The dancing on The Corny Collins Show is fantastic; and the choreography overall just couldn't be better.<br /><br />The two DVD "Shake And Shimmy" version of this release has very fine extras on the bonus disc. (The main disc has some links to interactive websites accessible only through the first DVD.) Look for plenty of material--well over two hours worth--on the making of Hairspray and the evolution of the story from John Waters's movie to Broadway play to this successful remake. Excellent! In addition, it is absolutely amazing what they did to make John Travolta into Edna Turnblad using elaborate makeup, costumes and special prosthetic makeup as well. Wow. The second DVD also has deleted scenes, and feature-length audio commentary from director and choreographer Adam Shankman, star Nikki Blonsky and producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a fun filled comedy with great musical numbers, look no further. The convincing acting truly moved me and many of the issues the film deals with are still being grappled with in our times. I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

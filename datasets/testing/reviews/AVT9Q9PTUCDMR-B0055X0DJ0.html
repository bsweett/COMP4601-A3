<meta name="summary" content="the humor from 1st Transformers is gone"></head><body><p>The thing is a mess. Sure the action is still killer, no filler. The problem is the 1st Transformers was done with a wink-in-the-eye sense of humor. This one has almost zero humor in it and any attempts at it are lame. I just didn't get why they had two jive talkin' transformers. Is this the 1970s?<br /><br />The whole premise seems flimsy. The US has some heavily secured facilities yet they are so easy to break into despite the fact they now know the evil Transformer decepticon robots exist. Then deaths here are cartoonish (OK, the series comes from a cartoon but it's still dumb).<br /><br />Also, explain to me how the mom and dad end up in Egypt. I still don't get how in the middle of some massive battle they just pop up when we last saw them maybe an hour ago in Paris.<br /><br />Also, the thing they are chasing or whatever is called the "matrix." Wow, how original! Name it after another hit sci-fi movie. Maybe it's all part of the comic book/cartoon series but I had to laugh at that. Also, laughable is this super evil decepticon is called "the Fallen." Really? That's the coolest name you could come up with with religious overtones?<br /><br />When you read the title, I expected "the Fallen" to stand for a group of decepticons. Nope. It stands for the big cheese decepticon. Dumb.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not like this movie is bad for what it is, it's just not as mindblowing as the 1st one.<br /><br />This DVD has zero extras, by the way.</p></body></html>

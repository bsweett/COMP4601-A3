The way the monster moved, grabbed people was all very realistic. The monster itself could have used some more CGI work. When it was off in a distance it looked very believable. But when you saw it up close it looked like a cartoon.<br /><br />The story was well done but had a lot of plot holes. The acting was good but I watched it with the English dubbing which was terrible. The people they got to do the voice overs sounded like they belonged doing anime. It was really bad. And the English script didn't always make sense either. It's probably better to watch this movie in it's original Japanese with subtitles. For that reason, I'm giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />But it was really good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bilingual in every sense of the word boring"></head><body><p>Although others will disagree with me, I found Spanglish as dry as burnt toast. There's literally no humor or romance, and the movie drags on for two hours without really doing much of anything. Tea leoni (Family Man, Jurassic Park 3) seems almost bored with the script, and Adam Sandler can't even hope to liven the dull boring moments that constantly shroud the movie.<br /><br />Want to watch a good romantic comedy with Adam as our star? Try Big Daddy or the Wedding Singer. Even Fifty first dates was better than Spanglish. Adam and Drew Barrymore definatly had more chemistry going than him and Paz Vega (Flor). As for Adam Sandler being a chef, or  his family delightfully eccentric. All I can say is "I so desperatly wish it where so." Maybe the movie might have had more of an appeal. Otherwise, it leaves you with a huge sense of doubt.<br /><br />My advice? For what its worth rent this movie, or better yet try borrowing off a friend. Then if you like it enough buy it, otherwise you might have a big dissapointment in store. Even if you are desperatly crazy about Adam Sandler.</p></body></html>

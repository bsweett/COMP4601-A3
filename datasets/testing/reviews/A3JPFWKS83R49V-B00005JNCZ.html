<meta name="summary" content="The Making of a Revolutionary"></head><body><p>Traveling is one of my favorite activities. Whether I'm taking a long vacation trip of one week or more or just a weekend getaway to a nearby resort, I'm always ready for some travel excitement. In this movie, the two lead characters are also very fond of travel. They hop aboard a motorcycle and proceed to traverse throughout South America, making for an entertaining film that combines travel adventure and politics to create a mesmerizing film with a strong message.<br /><br />This movie is based on a real- life event that occurred in the 1950's when Ernesto Guevara set off across the South American continent with his friend on the back of a motorcycle. Some might recognize the Guevara name from history- he was one of the people responsible for leading the Cuban revolution that brought Castro to power. He was on his way to perform medical work as part of his college internship and decided to make a long adventure out of it rather than flying directly to his destination.<br /><br />Among this film's strong points, which include the directing, the acting, and the hot Latin babes, the quality that stands out more than anything is the cinematography. The two young men depart form their native Argentina, head west to Chile, then north to Peru and ultimately to Venezuela. Along the way, the viewer is treated to great natural scenery like the Andes Mountains, the Atacama Desert, and the Amazon River. There is also some great man- made scenery as well, like that of an ancient Inca ruin in Peru. And there are some politically tragic scenes, like those that depict the unethical treatment received by peasants and others during this time in history.<br /><br />The direction of this movie is superb, and it is intended to get the viewer to think about social and economic justice. Supposedly, Guevara's traveling experience and the acts of injustice he encountered formed the basis for his decision to help lead the Cuban revolution. It's a little strange that he would forge a relationship with Castro's Cuba, since little or nothing in that island nation bears any resemblance to justice. But this is what happened, and this movie is based loosely on Guevara's eye- opening travel adventure.<br /><br />Some people will be turned off by a movie like this because of its obvious political leanings and its subtle endorsement of socialism as a political ideal. I certainly don't agree with any type of government philosophy based on authoritarianism. But I urge viewers not to let this dissuade them from watching this film. It offers great scenery, flawless direction, and great performances by the large cast of characters. Toss your political beliefs aside and give this film a chance. You will be happy you did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shattering premise"></head><body><p>First and foremost, let me get this off my chest:  PLEASE, PLEASE STOP PUTTING THIS UP AGAINST THE SIXTH SENSE!!  Doing that is nearly as inane as saying, &quot;Well, Spielberg directed 'Duel', so 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' has to be the same kind of film.&quot;<p>Now, with that out of the way, let me say that this is a DIFFICULT film to review.  I wanted to give it 3 stars based on the film's &quot;shaky&quot; storyline, but 5 stars for its breathtaking idea of taking a classic story and trying to mold it into the REAL world.  A superhero in our society?  How would that work?  How would he discover his powers?  In this light, the film works beautifully in terms of self-doubt on Bruce Willis' part and almost religious fervor on Samuel Jackson's.  And let's face it...it tries to delve a little more into a human being becoming a superhero based on knowledge and character as opposed to &quot;Super *whatever* one day stumbles into a radioactive factory, has these powers, and for some inexplicable reason finds himself compelled to do good for everyone!&quot;<p>However, the plot jolts around a little while and one almost feels compelled to bang your head against the screen and tell Bruce Willis to &quot;get on with it!&quot;  Still, once one comes back to earth and realizes that the story IS supposed to take place in the real world, it becomes a little more plausible--as plausible as fictitious superheroes get.<p>Enjoy the film!  It's not the strongest story and the ending is a little bit on &quot;ehhhh...&quot; side, but it is groundbreaking in its premise.<p>Best image in the entire film--Samuel Jackson's cane breaking...that is a shot that won't leave my mind!</p></body></html>

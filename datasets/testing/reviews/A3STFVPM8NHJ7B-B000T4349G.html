<meta name="summary" content="The Forgotten"></head><body><p>Julianne Moore stars as Telly, she is a mother who loses her son in a plane crash and refuses to let him go. She is swinging outside and the film gets really dark where you can barely she whats going on but it does clear up. Then all of the suddence, people around her do not remember her even having a son. Yes, it sounds oh so promising but that's where the movie goes into the toilet. She spends the night at one of her son's friends fathers home, not sexually but just happens to spend the night there. He does not remember having a daughter until she tears down some old wall paper in his office but he calls the cops. As she is escorted out, he remembers having a daughter and they go together to find out the truth and someone is chasing them and trying to stop them. Yes, the movie does have promise.  The ending is so stupid that I won't spoil it for anyone.<br /><br />Overall, you can probably find this movie really cheap. It's not a bad movie but like so many sci fi movies out there today ala The Knowning or The Box for example, it starts off good but the ending makes you scratch your head and yell at the screen--What the %^(!. There is an alternate ending but i've yet to watch it but I would like to check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""They call me a 'Lord of War' but perhaps it should be you.""></head><body><p>When Yuri Orlov [Nicholas Cage] discovers that his only talent is selling illegal arms to warlords and mafia crime lords, he starts on a wild ride that eventually [or I should say inevitably] leads him to getting in more messes that even the smoothest talking can't get him out of.<br /><br />Lord of War stars Nicholas Cage as a Ukrainian immigrant to America who discovers that they only thing he is good at is selling illegal weapons. His first deal is like, "The first time you have sex. You don't know what you are doing, but it is exciting, and ends way too quickly." Helped by his brother [Jared Leto] Orlov goes on to start selling more guns to countries that are at war with other countries because that is where the big money is in selling guns.<br /><br />The movie is styllish and is fast paced in lots of scenes as Orlov goes to different areas in the world, from Russia to Africa, to South America. He eventually reaches the top of the mountain and becomes very well known by war lords, has lots of one night stands with women, and not to mention he also becomes very rich. How rich? He rented out a hotel just so he could trap a beautiful model [Bridget Monayhan], his dream girl, and eventually charm her into marrying him.<br /><br />However like all good things there is an equal level of bad things such as; Orlov's brother as a cocaine addict, even running away with a kilo of cocaine and going crazy in a third world country. His wife has no idea what he does for a living, and like Cage's character says, "It's not the double life that you live that gets you, it's the fourth, fifth, and sixth lives that will."<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is also in the movie as an interpol agent whose sole purpose of living it seems is to bring Orlov down. The first scene we see Hawke's character is when Orlov is on a freighter with M-16's and has to cover the illegal guns with thousands of potatoes that don't exactly smell like a field of fresh flowers in the warm sun.<br /><br />The movie does have a lot of scenes not for younger viewers involving women, as well as a lot of violence and language. Some smaller plot lines include Orlov meeting a Liberian dictator [Eamonn Walker] whose son is just as ruthless as his father, holding his trademarked solid gold AK-47 with him wherever he goes.<br /><br />There aren't many extras for this DVD, besides seeing trailers for the movie and subtitles. The lack of extras is the only thing I would see as a down side if you are the type of person who is into DVD extras. This is totally worthy of a DVD rental if you want to see a good movie on a Saturday night. [or any other day of the week, it's your choice] But definately check this movie out for a solid story.<br /><br />"There is one person out of every 12 who owns a gun, the question is how to arm the other 11."</p></body></html>

Mel Gibson has created a story that is utterly fascinating to watch and exciting to watch unfold. The film is beautifully acted with excellent performances by all.  To name a couple of actors Rudy Youngblood is magnificent as Jaguar Paw and Morris Birdyellowhead is equally good as his father, the wise tribal leader Flint Sky.<br /><br />The story begins with the idyllic life of Jaguar Paw's village.  The film nicely builds its story with a depiction of the peaceful life of the village and we learn about the personalities of many of the men, women and children.  The most amusing part deals with Jaguar Paw's best friend and his shrewish mother.  The old woman scolds her son-in-law because she has no grandchildren and he is taken in by Flint Sky by his suggestion to rub what turns out to be chilies on himself before trying the next time with his wife. In the opening scene Jaguar Paw and his father are hunting a tapir with other men from the village.  After the tapir has been killed and the meat is being divided the members of another village need to pass by and we learn that their homes have been ravaged, forcing them to move on.  This is the first suggestion that all is not right in this jungle paradise - there is drought and disease.<br /><br />Once the pattern of life in the village has been established, it is attacked with the men and women taken prisoner except for Jaguar Paw's wife and son, whom he hides in a dry cistern. This sets the story for the rest of the film as Jaguar Paw desperately struggles to return to what is left of his village to rescue his family from the cistern, which is too steep to climb.  The captives are marched through the jungle across a raging river to one of the Mayan cities where the men are being ritually scarified. Not to give away too much of the story, Jaguar Paw manages to escape but is pursued.<br /><br />Neither my wife nor I found the violence depicted in the film particularly disturbing.  Certainly there is nothing in Apocalypto that we have not already seen in Braveheart and The Last of the Mohicans. Perhaps the goriest scene - when the victims have their hearts cut out and are decapitated - is shot around by the camera, focusing on the reactions of the people. What was highly fascinating for me is the re-creation of the Mayan civilization.  When Jaguar Paw and his fellow captives enter the city there is a marked difference between the city culture and the jungle culture that is immediately apparent so that Jaguar Paw is an outsider among his own people.<br /><br />The quote at the start of the fill by Will Durant - that a civilization is destroyed from within before it is destroyed from without - is the point of Apocalypto.  The Mayan civilization, despite its advances in astronomy and engineering, is destroying its population, given up for sacrifice, to appease the gods that are laying waste to the land.  Apocalypto is a beautifully photographed film with a story that is mind opening and unforgettable.</p></body></html>

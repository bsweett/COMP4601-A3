The Mafia depicted here clings to no pretenses of civility.  Everything is about money and power, and no one--not even &quot;made&quot; Mafiosi--are immune from a bullet to the back (or front or side) of the head for just about any reason.  Walk a little funny?  Get shot.  Talk back?  Get shot.  Bust someone's chops?  Get shot.  GoodFellas, in fact, spirals into a blood bath of gangster killing ganster for reasons ranging from revenge to keeping mouths shut permanently.<p>The story is told from the perspective a young Irish-Italian boy who becomes an errand runner for thugs who hang out across the street from his blue collar home.  The money, power, and freedom of being above the law are too much for him to resist, and, soon, he becomes a young, murderous thug himself.  Ray Liota, who plays this central character (and provides splendid narration), follows this path to its natural conclusion--a cocaine-addled, unfaithful, narcisstic mob informant.  The transformation is spectacular to watch, particular in the scenes leading up to his final arrest, complete with overtones of paranoia, a mysterious helicopter that seems to be shadowing him, the creation of an elaborate meal, a remarkable scene between the drug-snorting Liota and his junkie mistress, and a cranky, crazy drug courier-baby sitter.<p>A word of warning: GoodFellas is brutally violent.  People are dispatched, graphically, with guns, knives, and ice picks.  Frankly, the story wouldn't be as gut-wrenching or honest without the casual brutality of these animals in full display.  It makes the ease with which they kill all the more bizarre.</p></body></html>

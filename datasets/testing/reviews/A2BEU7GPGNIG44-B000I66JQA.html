<meta name="summary" content="3 Wonderful Performances"></head><body><p>All of the women in this film give good performances.  Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job playing a whacked out sheltered Virginia Woolf.  My favorite performances where those by Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.  These two women seemed to outshine Nicole Kidman in this film.  All three storylines were strong.  I really think this is a chick flick, I liked it, my husband hated it.</p></body></html>

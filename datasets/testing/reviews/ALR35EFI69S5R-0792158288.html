<meta name="summary" content="Terrific New Enhanced Version Of The Trilogy Of The Century!"></head><body><p>In the unlikely event that you have just returned from a twenty five year self-imposed exile in The People's Republic Of China or from an extended mission to the red planet,then you will want to introduce yourself to this new edition of the single most successful adventure fantasy trilogy of all time (well, at least until the recent introduction of Lord Of The Rings).  Needless to say, this edition is well worth the money. Not only is the action in each of the three movies non-stop, but also the stories themselves are well-conceived and the dialogue well written, while the erstwhile cast in each does a splendid job of supporting Harrison Ford in his many memorable escapades. <p>As he did with the Star Wars saga, George Lucas acts as the producer for the epics, employing his good friend Steven Spielberg to direct the films and breathe the kind of exciting life into them that propels them forward with verve, excitement, and a tongue-in-cheek resolve. Who can forget the anti-hero anti of Ford simply shooting a swordsman rather than duel with him, or the several deadly encounters he has with snakes (as he tells us again and again, he HATES snakes!).  The movies are mostly about Ford, as a typical throwback to the reckless daring-do type hero of the B-movies of the WWII era, and the fact that he succeeds so magnificently in his characterization of Indiana as an almost believable figure who is at the same time larger than life is a credit to his acting skills and his sheer animal magnetism. <p>The compiled DVD is replete with special features, and the quality of the print makes it a great improvement over the original VHS format, which was much more primitive technologically. The sound is greatly enhanced, all the way to the audible hissing of the damned snakes, and with the inclusion of many scenes, there are many reasons to order and own this version of the timeless classic, especially given the fact that all three movies are included. Get ready for some great entertainment, and pop up the popcorn! Enjoy!</p></body></html>

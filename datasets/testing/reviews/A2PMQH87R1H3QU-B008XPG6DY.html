Only I didn't give 5 stars to this thriller, because of her cast in this scrip!  J.ANISTON..Was wrong choice in this movie,She's "not" made for this kind of serious acting and this kind of scrip! She better stick with that comedy/drama she good at not this kind of scrip and movies...But CLIVE OWEN was a great and real good mach for this movie with his big gorges blue eyes and moves really grab u into to this thriller ride till end. I stopped buying DVDS these days since DEC/05.. Well I wants to buy this movie but waiting BLU-RAY/DVDS hit the store this summer and then  starting buying DVDS again!!.But I would like that ADD to my DVD collection later on. Anyway if u didn't see it buy or rent it. Is great solid edge of your seat suspense with great twist in end!!..A</p></body></html>

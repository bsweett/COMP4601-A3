I thought the second was an absolute disaster, though.<br /><br />Luckily, this one wasn't as terrible as the second.  But that's not saying much.<br /><br />For one, the villains are totally spoiled, in my opinion.  The sandman is so damn mopey and frowney that he's no fun.  He's just one of those "honest cons out to help his family" and decides the best way to use his new super power is to steal money and give it to his dying child---because the cops wouldn't dare track the money down when he looses it.  He's also apparently invincible, which makes him that much less interesting.<br /><br />Venom, one of my favorite villains from the old cartoon show, is reduced to a snotty little teen brat played by the actor who will forever be known as "That Foreman kid from That 70s Show", who made very lame wise-ass remarks even while in the Venom suit.  Imagine that fiendish black muscled creature with the huge mouth and snarling fangs suddenly snipping "Oh well look, Spiderman, you're like, such a douche!"<br /><br />Obligatory from the sequel is the "new" Goblin in the form of Harry Osborne.  This one seems to be the only one in the right frame of mind for killing Spiderman, as he's the only one who ever comes remotely close.  Unfortunately, he falls victim to the cliche' "let me talk to you while we're fighting and rather than do something efficient like stab you or shoot you or blow you up, let me just throw you into things and hope your bones shatter", and then ends up sustaining a head injury which SHOULD kill a normal person.  He loses his memory for a while, then slowly regains it long enough to provide the film's one high point for me---making Spiderman cry when Mary Jane walks out on him.<br /><br />Thus we enter Emo Spiderman.  The black venom's effect on Peter Parker, rather than make him anything remotely wicked or sneering, makes him emo.  Any time the venom takes hold of him, his hair goes over his eye emo-style, and he starts acting so ridiculously "suave", jerking his crotch at women at the street, dancing wildly at the local jazz club, and picking fights with people.  Tobey Maguire shows he's got a lot more acting classes to go through before he can convince us of this new "darker" Spiderman.<br /><br />Lousy acting, a dense plot, and laughably pathetic characters even more laughably pathetically acted makes this sequel worth watching only because of how bad it was.</p></body></html>

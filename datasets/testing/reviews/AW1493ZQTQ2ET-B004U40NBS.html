<meta name="summary" content="Convoluted, gimmicky, and disappointing"></head><body><p>The ratings for this movie have a U-shaped distribution, which means that it's largely a "love it or hate it" experience.  I'm sincerely glad that some people enjoyed it, but unfortunately I have to be counted more in the "hated it" group.  Up to about 2/3 of the way into the movie, I still had hope that it could be a winner, since the movie at least had some intensity and sexual tension, but alas when it was over I felt that it had all been a waste of time.<br /><br />Why so harsh?  Well, none of the characters are well developed, none of the relationships are well developed, not much really happens in the movie, and most importantly it never becomes clear what the lead character's problem is.  Was she always mentally ill?  What kind of mental illness did she have?  What was the cause?  Why was she not receiving any form of treatment?  Why did her mother allow her to pursue the rigors of ballet despite her condition?  There are no answers to be found in this movie.  In the end, I felt that shallow intrigue and gimmicks had been substituted for substance, with a big-name actress used to lure us in.<br /><br />Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie (even if you're a ballet fan), but I'll now have a look at some of the favorable reviews to see why some people liked it.<br /><br />Addendum: I've now finished reading several of the favorable reviews, and it seems that those reviewers tend to take this as a relatively abstract movie and often apply a psychoanalytic perspective.  Again, good for them, but I think that asks viewers to fill in too many blanks.  A movie should meet the viewer at least half way, and I don't think this one does.</p></body></html>

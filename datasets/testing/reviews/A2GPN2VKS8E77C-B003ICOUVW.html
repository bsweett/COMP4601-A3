From that point, it takes on a life that's all its own, emotionally and physically... Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving co-star in this extraordinary motion picture with bite. Joe Johnston ("Honey, I Shrunk The Kids," "The Rocketeer," "Jurassic Park III") directs. Hugo Weaving in this movie reminds me of Sam Niell. I highly recommend this movie. SPOILER!!! The ending hints at a sequel...which I hope will be made. SPOILER OVER!!! Should have been rated PG-13.</p></body></html>

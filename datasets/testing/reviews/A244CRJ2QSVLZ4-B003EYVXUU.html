<meta name="summary" content="Bullies, Child Abuse And Tragic Love Abound In Matt Reeve's Horrifying "Let Me In""></head><body><p>Twelve-year-old Owen is mercilessly abused by his schoolmates.  He is befriended by a strange neighbor, Abby, who doesn't wear shoes in the snow; Abby has been twelve years old for a very long time and keeps insisting she's not a girl.  Abby is a vampire who feeds on her neighbors.  Victims of child abuse, Owen and Abby form a romantic bond that will eventually have tragic consequences.<br /><br />  "Let Me In" is a horror film that I would've enjoyed more if I hadn't already seen the original Swedish version "Let the Right One In."  "Let the Right One In" is a superb psychological horror film centered around lonely, troubled adolescents who can empathize with one another; based on the best-selling novel of the same title, it has developed a worldwide cult following.<br /><br />  The acting in "Let Me In" is superb.  Child stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz give excellent performances.  However, the real surprise came from Richard Jenkins who gave an award-winning performance as the mild mannered music professor in "The Visitor."  Coincidentally, in "The Visitor," Jenkins befriends and aids two illegal immigrants.  In "Let Me In," he befriends and protects the vampire Abby and is even forced to kill for her.  These scenes were quite shocking.  From the commentary, we learn Jenkins performed all his own stunts.<br /><br />  The plot for "Let Me In" is very similar to the one for "Let the Right One In."  Much of the dialogue, especially from Owen and Abby, was verbatim.  The major difference was the introduction of the policeman who replaces the role of the nosy, vindictive neighbor in "Let the Right One In."  The policeman made "Let Me In" more realistic; however, viewers developed a liking for the policeman's character.  The outcome of his investigation draws sympathy away from the children who are made to look more like evil villains rather than the ill-fated victims of the novel's intent.<br /><br />  Despite the fact that "Let Me In" is a low-budget Hammer production (famous for their classic horror films of the late fifties to early seventies), the special effects are quite awesome.  The extra features on the DVD are required viewing.  They display the computer graphics used when Abby viciously attacks her victims and climbs trees, fences and hospital walls.  The elaborate car crash sequence was filmed outdoors using a cameraman mounted on the vehicle who was actually driving it; the scene was also filmed on stage in front of a blue screen and the vehicle was attached to a giant chicken rotisserie that spun it around and around.<br /><br />  The commentary from Matt Reeves (visionary director of the innovative, groundbreaking "Cloverfield" - a gloomy, claustrophobic monster film as seen from the lens of a home video camera) is interesting and informative.  I was never bored.  It was unbelievable to learn what was actually filmed at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and what was created by computer graphics.  For example, remember when Jenkins attacks the boy at the railroad tracks?  The train never existed.  Also, from listening to Reeves, one learns more about Abby's background and why she keeps telling Owen that she is not a girl when he wants to date her.  One must watch the deleted scene titled "Be Me."  Actually, the entire film is about Owen empathizing with Abby's plight.  She kills in order to survive; however, Owen can't judge her because he fantasizes about killing Kenny and the other bullies.<br /><br />  The viewer learns there are numerous instances of child abuse in "Let Me In."  Owen seems to suffer the most in the film.  He is psychologically harmed by his parents' divorce and is bullied at school by Kenny.  Kenny is bullied by his older brother; therefore, he relieves his pent-up anger and stress by abusing Owen.  Many years ago, Abby was forever physically traumatized by an elderly nun.  Now she is forced to feed on the blood of others.  "Romeo and Juliet" is a novel read by Owen and his classmates which is apropos to the film.  A tragedy, "Romeo and Juliet" mirrors the doomed romance of Owen and Abby; eventually, it will lead to tragedy.  The commentary suggests that Jenkins' character was once a twelve-year-old boy who developed a friendship with Abby.<br /><br />  With the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, I read the full color miniature comic book, "Let Me In: Crossroads," that was included with my copy of the DVD.  It has good illustrations.  The first of four in a new series, this comic is a prelude to the film.  Taking place in the farming community of Wellsville, Indiana, it gives Abby's guardian/protector a name, Thomas, and depicts more of Abby's vicious quest for blood.  Fans of the film may want to read this comic book series from Dark Horse Comics and Hammer.<br /><br />  I would've enjoyed "Let Me In" more if Matt Reeves had made it more different from the Swedish film "Let the Right One In."  My dad said the same thing.  While watching the opening scenes of "Let Me In," he asked, "Didn't I see that boy and girl in another film?"  I told him we had watched "Let the Right One In," which has the same plot.  Reeves should have taken into consideration the fans who had already seen "Let the Right One In."  Also, the gory finale of "Let Me In" would've been more enjoyable if the bullies hadn't turned the lights off in the pool house.  If it hadn't been for the commentary, I wouldn't have known exactly what had happened.  "Let Me In" is gorier and has superior special effects than "Let the Right One In."  However, the latter came first and has the element of surprise.<br /><br />  I have no regrets watching "Let Me In."  I feel that I learned a lot more about the relationship between the vampire and the boy.  In order to learn the complete story, I feel compelled to read the novel "Let the Right One In" by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  According to Matt Reeves, the film would have to be a miniseries in order to give justice to the highly involved novel.  I have read Lindqvist's novel "Handling the Undead," which is an expertly written psychological horror novel focusing on people's reactions upon learning their loved ones have returned from the grave.  "Let Me In" is required viewing if you want to delve deeper into the mystique of the Swedish horror sensation "Let the Right One In."<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos</p></body></html>

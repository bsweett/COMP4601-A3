Not because I thought it would be horrible - in fact, I expected it to be quite good.  I've always loved Tim Burton, and the premise sounded great.  So this Christmas, when my brother received it for a Christmas present, I finally sat myself down and watched it.<br /><br />The storyline is great: Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's spookiest spook, is getting sick of Halloween.  One day, he stumbles across a door which leads him into Christmastown - and immediately, Jack is entranced by this jolly world in which all is good all the time.  And so Jack decides to bring Christmas to Halloweentown.<br /><br />I can sum up my thoughts about the film in two sentences, as sang by the fabulous Danny Elfman: "What's this?  What's this?"  This film is always rated very highly, but I found it to be extremely bizarre, creepy, and even a little repulsive.  I wouldn't dream of showing it to my kids, with the eerie creatures and lines such as "Kidnap Santa, chop him into bits".  The animation was fantastic, but I thought the rest of the film was weak.  There is, however, one great song, "What's This?".<br /><br />While I can understand people enjoying this film, I just couldn't.  It's too bizarre, grim, and perhaps even grotesque for my tastes.  I suppose you'll just have to try it for yourself.</p></body></html>

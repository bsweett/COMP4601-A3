<meta name="summary" content="for anyone who hates child molesters, you're in for a treat!"></head><body><p>Controversial? Definately. Enjoyable? Very much so. Recommended to me by friends, I had to try this. I was amazed by the restraint from graphic and sexual violence. Ellen Page is brand new to me, but she was great in this! A 14-year old, behaving like an adult, emotionally torturing this guy who may a molester, so many things happen in this movie that I wasn't expecting, and there were times you didn't know who to root for. The writer and director took an idea that may have been done before, and throws the audience for a loop. I've never seen a 14 year old girl do something like this-act like an adult, and take the law into her own hands. To me, this film was very original, everything was done very subtly, and sometimes that isn't a bad thing. Rent this film, it's worth it, believe me! It's also worth owning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb Thriller and Intriguing Portrait of a Paranoid Dictator."></head><body><p>"The Last King of Scotland" is based on the novel of the same name by Giles Foden, set in Uganda in the1970s during the reign of bloodthirsty President Idi Amin. The picture it paints of Idi Amin attempts to be accurate in tone and deed. But Foden places a fictional Scotsman who becomes an advisor to Amin into the historical context, turning the story into a thriller and giving us an insider's eyes through which to see Amin. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is feeling restless in his father's medical practice in Scotland. Eager for adventure and new challenges, he goes to Uganda to assist at a small hospital in the jungle. Nicholas' bold response to a crisis impresses the nation's President, Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), who recently took power in a military coup with Britain's blessings. Amin asks Nicholas to become his personal physician and help create a new Health Service for the country. Nicholas' vanity gets the best of him, and he finds himself beholden to Amin's whims and complicitous in his abuse.<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland", named for Idi Amin's love of all things Scottish and his support for Scottish nationalism, is accurate in the big picture of what went on in Uganda under Amin, while it changes details and rearranges events to serve Nicholas' story. The film's greatest attempt to inform is in the depiction of the charismatic, capricious Idi Amin. Forest Whitaker won an Oscar for his portrayal of this larger-than-life personality who was as charming and perceptive as he was paranoid and immoral. James McAvoy deserves a lot of credit as well for his vain, naive, and ultimately desperate turn as Nicholas. Nicholas represents Britain's view of Amin as it changed from hope to denial to horror over the course of his presidency. "The Last King of Scotland" is a fantastic marriage of history and thriller with a dose of politics as well. Nicholas' actions propel us through the story without missing a beat. The atmosphere is superb. Director Kevin Macdonald's first fiction film is successful in every way.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 2 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer (2 min), 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. "Capturing Idi Amin" (29 min) is a BBC short documentary about the real Idi Amin, how Ugandans perceived him,  facts vs fiction in the film, and the challenges in placing a fictional story in a historical context. "Forest Whittaker - Idi Amin" (6 min) interviews actors Whitaker and McAvoy about the character of Amin. "Fox Movie Channel Presents: Casting Session" (8 min) interviews the film's director, producer, and casting director Jina Jay about how they cast Forest Whitaker, who talks about preparing for the role. There is a good audio commentary by director Kevin Macdonald. He talks a lot about locations and people in Uganda who were involved with the film, provides some additional information about Amin, and addresses character development. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

The original film, Let the Right One In, was an adaptation of a book that had complicated, uncomfortable themes that made it a challenge to adapt to the big screen.  This gave the Swedish film some rough edges: a prelude to a retrospective montage that never happened, Eli's androgyny, and the potentially unpleasant relationship between Eli and her "ghoul" (to use a Vampire RPG term).<br /><br />The androgynous nature of Eli changes her interactions with Oskar.  The mysterious relationship between Eli and her guardian let the viewer come to his or her own conclusions. Although Let the Right One In wasn't perfect, its flaws made it a better film. Let Me In smoothes over all these rough edges, for better or worse.<br /><br />The beautiful and deadly Chloe Grace Moretz (excellent as Hit Girl in Kick-Ass and equally breathtaking here) is Abby, an unearthly little girl who doesn't seem bothered by the cold, loves puzzles, and whose appearance veers from pretty to bedraggled. She befriends outcast Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, just as vulnerable here as he was in The Road), who dreams of stabbing the bullies who harass him.<br /><br />The subtle but important difference between the two films pivots on what the bullies call Owen (Oskar in the original): "little pig." In the American version, Owen is called a little girl.  The gender appellation shifts the movie's focus from two lonely souls finding each other across the gulf of death to two Romeo and Juliet-style prepubescent tweens discovering romance. This doesn't lessen the emotional impact of Let the Right One, but it does change the film's tone significantly.<br /><br />With the exception of the cat sequence, which is missing entirely from Let Me In, Let the Right One In has creepier special effects.  Whether it's Eli/Abby's eyes flashing like a cat, the wreck of Hakan/Thomas' (Richard Jenkins) acid-ravaged face, or Virginia's (Sasha Barrese) horrible conflagration, Let Me In's digital effects look subpar in comparison. For some reason, all of Abby's attacks are handled digitally, which makes them surreal.<br /><br />Even the ending, which is almost a frame-for-frame reproduction, lacks the gut punch of the original by ratcheting back the gore. Let Me In fixes many discrepancies in Let the Right One In, but in doing so seems to be embarrassed by its Swedish roots.  But if you've never seen the original, Let Me In is an excellent substitute.</p></body></html>

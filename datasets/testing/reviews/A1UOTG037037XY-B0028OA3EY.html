This movie is definitely a keeper beceause for the first time, I realized from Brandon Routh's performance and from the production style that Superman is a heartbroken hero who has no one to talk to.  I sort of ignored that aspect of the character although it was expressed in the Christopher Reeve films.  I was never crazy about the character as a hero but I realize now that it sucks to be Kal-El.  His world is irreversibly gone.  The new story is also a bad one for the hero.  This movie is much better than I expected.  I didn't like the casting from photographs but in moving pictures, both Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth look and express themselves beautifully.  It also helps to cast overqualified character actors Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey.  And Brandon Routh can pull off the same thing that Christopher Reeve did - be beautiful by gazing kindly i.e. evoke being beautiful from within despite whatever either one of them looks like.  Well done!  Someone else trying to do that would most likely look manipulative or drippy.  I absolutely loved how I felt assured listening to Brandon Routh use Jor El's words at the end of the movie.  It sucks to lose your entire world and way of life because of evil.  It makes me want to go in and fix it, just get it done and get it over with once and for ALL because otherwise is unacceptable and unbearable to think of.</p></body></html>

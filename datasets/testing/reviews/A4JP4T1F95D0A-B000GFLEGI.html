The movie is good, but not all I would have hoped it could be.  Since it has been so long between dead movies, I was hoping for more to the story.  It certainly has promise, but doesn't feel completely fleshed out.  If rumors are true, and this is part of a new trilogy, I may have to update my review.  Right now, it didn't leave me completely satisfied.</p></body></html>

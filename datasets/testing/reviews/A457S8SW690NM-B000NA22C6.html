The movie for one is a really good movie with lots of twists, frights, and comic moments. The movie is about writer Mort Rainey, portrayed by Johnny Depp very well, who is living a calm life with his small dog on the outscurts of a small town. His ex wife lives in his real house in the city but they still haven't filed papers for the divorce. Mort is still haunted by peeping in on her and seeing her in bed with an other man. She claims she didn't cheat on him but he thinks otherwise.... Well anyway, everything's going fine for him until John Shooter comes to his house. This man's from Mississipi and is brilliantly portrayed by John Turturro. This small writer claims that Mort has stolen his story who denies it but when Shooter leaves a copy of his story, Mort realizes that they are identical. And then Shooter goes absolutely crazy and things start happening. Bad things. For one, don't get attached to the dog like I did. But, this horror movie with some very comic moments is one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years. Turturro's performance will always be remembered by me as one of the best EVER. You should see it just for that and for his awesome performance. His performance is even better than it was in the Birdcage, which was also great. Johnny Depp on top of it is wonderful as usual and adds a lot to it. This horror movie is surprisingly good and scary and I strongly recommend it.</p></body></html>

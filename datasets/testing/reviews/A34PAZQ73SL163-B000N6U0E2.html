Here he gives an incredible performance as the quintessential good man who struggles to survive against random events which nearly overwhelm him (and would probably overwhelm anyone else). I just got done making a point about the movie Apocalypto which I will also make here. Movies like these fully reveal how silly we are to spend so much time obsessed with race, sex, and class in our society because no matter what your persuasion or ethnicity is most of us can easily relate intimately to those who differ from us when the circumstances necessitate it. In this film we cheer for Smith to succeed with all of our might. Our desire to see him make it is all-consuming.<br /><br />All of us, no matter what we look like, can relate to the character of Chris Gardner. The first hour of the film is almost painful to watch as we see a bright, capable, assertive man get beaten down by the vagaries of life. They called him "Ten Gallon Head" in high school because of how smart he was but most of the film is a testament to man's impotence and limitations when confronted with forces he cannot control. His intelligence does not even seem to matter. Gardner seems to "run bad" for 95 percent of the movie.<br /><br />Yet, his character and belief in himself are pervasively on display. He is a role model to everyone. Despite the disasters that keep punching him in the gut he refuses to quit. He refuses to accept defeat. He fights until...well, see the film. I bet you'll love the ending as much as I did. Yes, it is a tear-jerker but I was quite taken with The Pursuit of Happyness.</p></body></html>

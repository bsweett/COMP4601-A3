<meta name="summary" content="'I'm not much on rear window ethics'"></head><body><p>One of Hitchcock's favourites of his own films, REAR WINDOW is up there with the master's best, including VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and PSYCHO. James Stewart has one of his best roles here as L.B Jefferies, a photographer who busts up his leg and gets stuck in an apartment with nothing to do but stare at the neighbours. Voyerism, wit and suspense are all well played and along with Jimmy's great performance, there is the amazing Grace Kelly and Ramond Burr as the surly neighbour who may, or may not have killed his wife. Franz Waxman's musical score adds a tense layer of gripping suspense, with one of the scores where the music is the 5th character. Everything about the film is brilliant. What other film could you mention where every line is classic? Stella: 'Let's go down there and find out what's buried in that garden.' Lisa Carol Fremont: 'Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald.'<br />If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. It is one of the most superbly-crafted films of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I enjoyed it..."></head><body><p>...and after the sound thrashing the critics gave it, I was not expecting to.<br />No spoilers, I promise.<br /><br />Is it worth seeing in the theater?<br />Did you enjoy the first three?<br />Then the answer is a resounding yes.<br />I think the critics were expecting more of a rebirth for the franchise and that's not what this movie is.<br />It's called part 4 for a reason lol.<br />It's a definite continuation.<br />It was a little weird not having Orlando and Keira there but the new actors brought a wonderful new dimension to the film that after a few minutes I didn't miss Orlando or Kiera...not that I wouldn't mind seeing them in a future installment.<br />Ian McShane and Penelope Cruz were wonderful and perfect for this film.<br /><br />So what was good?<br />Pretty much everything.<br />It's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie folks.<br />It's got action, action, and more action.<br />I've heard other complaints that it was paced too slowly.<br />???<br />Are you kidding, for a two hour plus movie this flew right by me.<br />The acting was excellent.<br />The score, pacing, cinematography was perfect.<br />A lot of people were turned off by the story line in part 3 and yes, it had it's moments of who's on first, who's on second, who is double crossing who in what scene from the next.<br />"Stranger Tides" does not suffer from this.<br />The story was interesting and enjoyable but not difficult to follow.<br /><br />What didn't I like?<br />The first half of the movie is VERY heavy on action with little bits of dialog in between the chaos...not enough dialog actually.<br />The second half of the movie cuts back on the action and gives us way more character development and story.<br />The second half was actually much more enjoyable for me as the first half felt a tad unbalanced.<br /><br />That minor gripe aside..if you loved 1,2 and 3 of the Pirates franchise, you'll enjoy this.<br />Not a rebirth but a darn good continuation of a series I love.<br />The magic has NOT been lost...<br />Funny.<br />A great story.<br />Incredible acting from everyone.<br />Entertaining.<br />Action...lots of it.<br />Can't wait for part 5.<br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

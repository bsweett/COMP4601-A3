There is much to admire, particularly a stellar cast all doing a great job.  I also have a strong stomach (and love stuff like RESERVOIR DOGS, KILL BILL, etc. etc. in which the bad guys are dispatched in "creative" ways) and appreciation for well done violence.<br /><br />But there were too many things that bothered me...Director Tony Scott's directing style for starters.  If you haven't seen it, I can't really explain the jitteriness of it.  Most of the scenes have tricky editing, in which the picture jumps around or changes colors, or little snippets of things we've seen in the past are thrown in.  I think it's all supposed to make us feel on edge.  It works in bits and pieces, but the WHOLE DARN MOVIE!!!  Please!  The editor, director and cinematographer were having a bit too much fun for their own good.  You shouldn't be aware CONSTANTLY that you're watching a filmed image that is being heavily manipulated.  I felt constantly pulled away from my efforts to "suspend disbelief."  A movie like TRAFFIC, for example, played around with film stock and was a bit "tricky" in the same way.  But it actually helped us keep track of the myriad story lines, and at least the camera stayed still!<br /><br />And despite this gloss of "artistry," the movie is really nothing more than a simple revenge flick...which I have NO problem with by the way.  But there are bits of dialogue that try to have great import to them...and there's a recurring bit with a bullet that doesn't fire when expected that's simply too FRAUGHT WITH MEANING to be anything but vaguely laughable.  If only the people behind the scenes could have realized that with a cast like they had to work with...they didn't need to work so hard.<br /><br />As you probably know, the film deals with the "damaged" bodyguard/former assassin Denzel Washington, and his relationship with his young charge, played by Dakota Fanning.  She helps make him feel alive again (in some scenes this is done VERY effectively...others are just cloying).  But when misfortune strikes, and Washington lets her down in a major way, he goes on a rampage of revenge that makes his character in TRAINING DAY look like a boy scout.  He not only is merciless, he seems to revel in coming up with creative ways to kill off everyone involved in the plot.  That's all well and good, and is the real reason to see the film.<br /><br />Washington is very good.  His naturally clipped manner works well, and when he dons his sunglasses, he exudes NO friendliness whatsoever.  Dakota Fanning is, of course, a fine young performer and is very good here.  Rhadha Mitchell plays her mother very well.  Marc Anthony is the dad (I won't discuss what happens to him, except to complain that the events Mom sets into motion might be frowned upon by little Dakota later!).  Christopher Walken plays an old friend of Washington's...and low and behold, he can still play a "normal" guy.  No quirks, no vacant stare. He's engaged in his role and feels like a real person.  Not that I don't LOVE his quirky characters, but it's good to remember that he is a skilled actor.  Mickey Rourke has a small role that suits him well.<br /><br />I just couldn't warm up to the film.  It's a bit too long for starters...the plot doesn't really required 2 hours and 15 minutes.  The ending lacks the emotional kick I'm sure it thought it had.  And again, there's the annoying filming style.  I won't say "don't see it," but I will say that I think it could EASILY have been a lot better too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Sequel"></head><body><p>After reading several negative reviews about Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, I had small expectations when I went to see the film.  In my point-of-view, the critics are dead wrong.  One of the critical objections that I looked for was a lack of "chemistry" between Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. I don't know what the critic thought was missing but considering that neither Jack Sparrow nor Angelica can afford to trust the other, their performances were spot on.  I also cannot agree that Johnny Depp's performance was lacking anything; his performance had the freshness of the first film in the series.<br /><br />On Stranger Tides is an entertaining movie with an excellent story that has several interesting twists and turns (some minor spoilers follow). The opening of the film finds Gibbs (perfectly played once again by Kevin McNally) on trial for being mistaken as Captain Jack Sparrow only to be saved by Sparrow impersonating a judge.  The elaborate escape that follows, with plenty of excellent stunt work (including a cameo by Dame Judi Dench), is beautifully carried out.  Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has joined the Royal Navy in this installment and is seeking to be the first to find the Fountain of Youth for King George II (nicely played by Richard Griffiths of Harry Potter fame).  Barbossa is as slippery as usual but is never as ruthless as Blackbeard (Ian McShane) is.  It has been predicted that Blackbeard (who has an array of black magic powers) will meet his death soon so he will stop at nothing to be the first to the Fountain. The mermaids were a marvelous addition to the story.  I don't buy the comparisons to vampires just because the mermaids show fangs.  I also liked the role of Philip (the preacher, sensitively played by Sam Claflin) who falls in love with the captured mermaid Syrena (end of spoilers)<br /><br />Altogether, On Stranger Shores is an entertaining action film. There is plenty to like from the special effects, to the verbal sparing between Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to the malevolent evil of Blackbeard.  This film is more a true successor to the original film in spirit and story than the second and third installments.</p></body></html>

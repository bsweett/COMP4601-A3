<meta name="summary" content="Could Have Been Great, Just OK"></head><body><p>I am a fan of almost Sci-Fi movies and video games, so am predispositioned to rate even "bad" movies as at least watchable. Sadly, this is the group Doom falls into. The premise is fairly straight forward and those who played game will likely enjoy seeing the monsters "fleshed out"  (pun intended :-) but it loses a lot in translation from game to movie.<br /><br />"The Rock" turned in a strong performance and perhaps saved the film almost singlehandedly. The special effects were great in some parts and fairly weak in others, which leads me to believe that there was more than one production company working on the CGI elements.<br /><br />Overall, it is watchable and even enjoyable if you are fan of the genre.</p></body></html>

With all due respect to the superior acting provided by all members of the cast, the desert remains the central character because of the exquisite care with which director David Lean presents it. How insignificant human activities seem when set within the context of the endless, timeless sand. Nonetheless, occasionally an exceptional leader emerges who -- for whatever reasons -- eventually acquires mythic stature. Such a leader was T.E. Lawrence, author of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom on which Robert Bolt's screenplay is based. Paradoxically, we know a great deal about his relatively brief life and career and yet in so many ways he remains an enigma. Like a force of nature, perhaps he can never be fully understood. This film traces his military career from Cairo in 1917 until just before his death in 1935 at age 47. Most of the film focuses on his efforts to help the Arabs to achieve their independence, leading their revolt against the Turks and then trying (without much success) to get the leaders to trust and cooperate with each other. (Given the circumstances in the Middle East today, this is an especially interesting subject which Lean examines in some depth.) The cast includes a number of distinguished actors such as Omar Sharif (Sherif Ali ben El Kharish), Alex Guinness (King Feisal), Anthony Quinn (Auda Abu Tayi), Jack Hawkins (General Allenby), Claude Rains (Dryden) and Jose Ferrer (Turkish Bey). However, O'Toole's commanding presence dominates each scene in which he appears just as Lawrence's force of will overcomes Arab doubts about his leadership.<p>For me, this film has lost none of its impact since I first saw it in 1962. Yes, it is an epic in so many ways but Lean wisely includes a number of intimate moments which remind us that these are human beings whom his cast members portray. To both the British and to the Arabs, Lawrence was an enigma...and so he is to me. I am reminded of Whitman's observations in Song of Myself: "Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes." The same can be said of O'Toole's Lawrence. Even by the conclusion of this almost three-hour film, we still do not fully understand the motives which drive Lawrence's behavior nor the demons which probably help to explain his immensely complicated personality. He seems to me to be -- like the vast dessert across which he establishes his celebrity -- a force of nature which is what it is, in some respects beyond our comprehension.</p></body></html>

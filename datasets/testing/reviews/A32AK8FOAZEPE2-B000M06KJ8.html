<meta name="summary" content="what a waste of money and time"></head><body><p>one of the worst movies viewed in 2005. wasted tons of money in costumes, manpower, settings, make-up...even a lot of pastries made by maybe the best french pastries chefs, but after threw in so much and so many ingredients into this movie, it just ended up a stupid, pointless, ridiculous, purposeless, bore-to-death film. the worst thing we hated to see was the waste of so many hired temporary people and by god, that's also the best thing from this movie: giving some opportunities for them(the french movie union members?) to make some extra easy money.<br />the actor who played the heroine was a bad cast who never made herself seriously perform this queen of france. she was just having some fun changing clothes, wearing lot of shoes, hugging different poodles, enjoying the free chow. all the other supporting actors who played any necessary and unnecessry roles in this film also turned out to be one dimensional cardboard like figures. nobody and nothing ever developed well.<br />an absolute hollow screenplay with bad directing is one thing. inappropriate composed sound track that further ridiculed the movie of that specific era is another unforgivable mistake.<br />this movie could only compare to that ridiculous, hollow, shallow, empty, big-yawn chinese movie played by zhang ziyi?, "the banquet", and possibly the even worse coming-to-theatre new movie, 'curse of the golden flower', directed by the totally mind-losing zhang yimou who's now obsessed in blow-out-of-water budget for materialism for his pathetic movie making.<br />all these movies have the similar problem:<br />huge budgets, lousy and hollow screenplays, bad directings, meaningless, purposeless overdone and over-kill luxrious visual stunning settings, costumes, special effects, ridiculous manpower wastes.<br />they all committed the same flaw: forgot a good screenplay is the utmost important element of making a good movie, instead, only focused on making their movies look more visually beautiful but superfluously shallow.<br />i strongly suggest you please view these three movies together to see what i meant here, then you might understand how and why some of the production teams and the directors lost their wits and basic judgments.</p></body></html>

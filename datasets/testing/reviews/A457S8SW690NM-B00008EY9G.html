<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly freaky movie with a very unpredictable ending"></head><body><p>Well, I was bored and decided to rent some cheap horror movie for some laughs and so forth. But, then guess what happened. This movie rocked!!!!!!! The movie is about strangers that all gather at a motel because of a terrible storm. There's the newly weds, the beautiful prostitute (played by Gorgeous Amanda Peet!), a couple with a child but the wife is mortally wounded, a cop and his prisoner, an ex cop now limousine driver, a rich snob, and of course the owner of a motel. But, all of these characters have secrets and when one by one, they start getting murdered, something weird's going on. The ending is highly unpredictable with a great twist. This movie is one great suspense/ horror movie with some very freaky moments and the stellar cast includes John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet. This horror movie is a must see.</p></body></html>

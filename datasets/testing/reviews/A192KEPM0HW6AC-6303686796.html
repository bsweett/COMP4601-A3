<meta name="summary" content="God's Lonely Man"></head><body><p>Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have concocted a perfect movie with "Taxi Driver," which follows Robert deNiro's defining role of loner cabbie Travis Bickle.  The claustrophobic sets and tight cinematography, Bernard Herrmann's curiously tasty mix of polyphony and jazz in his final score, and the ever-present foley effect of an alarm clock ticking (connoting Bickle's state of mind of mental deterioration, a human time-bomb waiting to explode) all make for a highly personal character study of this self-described "God's Lonely Man."<p>What's more, Scorsese's triumph is getting the viewer to actually identify and sympathise with Travis, with his sense of isolation from society, with his obsession over Cybill Shepherd, his taking the young prositute, Iris (played with uncanny spunk by a young Jodie Foster) under his wing, and his unflagging mania for vengeance against "the scum, the dogs, the filth."  As he pads anonymously up and down Broadway, as he drives his taxi on rainswept streets in the wee hours of the morning, and as he sits alone in his apartment, pouring peach brandy over his Wheaties, we the viewers are along on his lonely ride and journey into fear.<p>Is Travis the hero, the antihero or the villain of this flick?  It really doesn't matter. Travis is a man compelled, his hand forced by the rot, corruption and indifferent hatred bred on the city streets.  The cesspool of crime is its logical consequence, just as much as is Travis, the loner turned lone gunman.  It is fitting that in his "training" scenes he is wearing cowboy boots, for he has a score to settle.  Not so much with Sport (played with abrasive wit by Harvey Keitel) and the pimps, johns and druggies that people this new urban frontier of lawlessness.  No, they are merely the tangible targets of his psychotic hate; The vengeance Travis metes out with his .44 Magnum is against a world that sees him as a virtual invisible man. Just as society turned their backs on the Vietnam vet, so does the woman of his dreams, Betsy (Shepherd).  Initially, Travis sees her as the last glimmer of hope for the redemption of a society gone to ruin.  But, when she rebuffs and deserts him over the clumsy social faux-pas of taking her to a porno movie on a first date, society loses all meaning to him, and he exacts his vengeance on society in order to transcend her rejection of him.  You can tell his fate is sealed when he sees his life "pointed in one direction....there never has been any choice for me." <p>The setting is modern, but what makes "Taxi Driver" into an eternal classic is its dark and tragic sense-of-life. Scorsese's movies would never be so darkly hopeless after this one; Even the gruesome "Goodfellas" had a much more lighthearted touch (if you can believe it).  This would also be Bernard Herrmann's last score.  In fact, he died just hours after recording the last bars of the score on a Hollywood sound stage.  It is a fitting swan-song for the movies' greatest composer, and a greater loss for Hollywood than they'll ever realise.<p>Darker than almost all films noir, think of "Death Wish" crossed with "Othello" when you think of "Taxi Driver."</p></body></html>

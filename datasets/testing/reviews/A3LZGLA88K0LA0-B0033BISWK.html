<meta name="summary" content="ALIENATION"></head><body><p>DISTRICT 9 is one of the most innovative sci-fi films of the decade.  Producer Peter Jackson and director Neill Blommkamp have fashioned a visceral examination of social mores and intolerance that resonates even when the movie morphs into the standard shootemup.  The effects are stunning and the shift from its documentary style beginning to its action packed finale, the movie packs an emotional wallop with an allegorical message and some touches of humor along the way.  Newcomer Sharlto Copley is brilliant as the bureaucrat forced to run for his life and join forces with the aliens.<br />DISTRICT 9 is a marvelous film and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

By the end, the story became very interesting and was very fun to watch. Yeah, this movie is overhyped a little, but it is still a really good movie. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are raally great in their roles on this film. It's not a film you have to really think about, it is just a good comedy.</p></body></html>

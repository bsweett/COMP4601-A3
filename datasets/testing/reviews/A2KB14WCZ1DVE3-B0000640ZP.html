<meta name="summary" content="Nicole Kidman the way I like her"></head><body><p>Yes, I know it's the movies, and yes, it's only acting, and yes, I like her as an actress tremendously.  Yet after seeing movie after movie with Nicole Kidman playing a cold as ice man manipulator, my movie psyche needs some payback.  I got it with this movie.  <p>So even though she introduces what may be her bitchiest character yet, it was nice to see she doesn't have nearly the power over people she would like you to think.  She plays a mother of two children, probably a widow, in post-war England.  She lives in a huge mansion, and has children who cannot be exposed to sunlight.  It is this condition that forces her to be tough and disciplined, especially to the new trio of servants she has just hired.  <p>But it is not only toughness out of necessity.  If you see how she OVER-punishes her children, and assumes it is the servants who left some doors open (it couldn't be HER!) that she also has some inner meanness to her.  If you've seen her other movies, you KNOW it, but if this is your first Nicole Kidman movie, you have to watch to see the true nature of the character come out.  <p>So when her fragile world starts crumbling around her, I for one was glad to see her unwind by finding that maybe she doesn't have all the power over her house she thinks she has.  We see all the beginning classic symptoms of the haunted house, with unexplained noises and physical things being mysteriously altered.  Of course, all around her deny everything, and after several instances of this, she has to make a decision to accept this, become stronger, or breakdown.  <p>I will reveal to you that all three things happen, but not necessarily in that order.  She does valiantly make a stand to hold her title of Ice Queen. But eventually the supernatural gauntlet she is dragged through causes her to eventually break down.  This was a big moment of the movie for me.  <p>However, I wouldn't be giving the movie four stars if it didn't have other things going for it.  There is a big secret plot twist that I imangine people will say was taken from another recent movie, but I will say it did get me hook, line, and sinker.  And just like that other movie, it honestly gives all the clues necessary to reach this conclusion upon a second viewing.  <p>Which is another reason why I like this.  I did not like "Vanilla Sky" (by the way, not the movie this one "borrows" from), and even upon a second viewing of "Sky", when I knew the secret, I still though the movie did not play fair with the audience.  "The Others" does play fair, and was enjoyable upon the second viewing, where it becomes interesting all over again once you know the secret.</p></body></html>

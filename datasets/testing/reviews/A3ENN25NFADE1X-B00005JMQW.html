<meta name="summary" content=""The Best Superhero Film Ever""></head><body><p>I saw this film on opening day, once again I was scarred . So scarred, I thought sweat was dripping from my back. I was worried that this film would suck, I WAS WRONG AGAIN.<br /><br />June 30, 2004<br /><br />The day "Spider-Man 2" came out, was the day I tried to remember aii of the great superhero movies that came out in the last 20 years. The first "Batman" film was okay, "Superman" was considered the best superhero film ever, it showed the mythology of Superman in a graphic way. The first "Spider-Man" Film showed more action than plot, or the characters that I'd grown to love. I wanted to know more about Peter Parker and Mary Jane. I like the original Spider-Man, but I was a little disappointed  by the film. That's all I remember about "Spider-Man" was the epic fight scenes between Spider-Man and The Green Goblin. I went to AMC Theaters, I sat down in my seat, and relaxed. I realized I felt that same feeling again, I haven't felt this emotion in two years, I was happy.  I was even happy to walk into the theater, I know that I'm about to see something spectacular when I'm happy.<br /><br />The film began, I was very annoyed by the commercials being showed before the film. In my mind I was thinking, "START THE FILM ." As the lights dimmed I got excited and as the film began, I heard the musical score and I was thrilled<br /><br />THE CRITICS<br /><br />The critics finally got it right. Roger Ebert and Harry Knowles said that this film is probably the best superhero film ever. This time, they were right. My favorite scene was when Peter Parker and Mary Jane were arguing, this scene seems almost human and very emotional. Peter Quotes: "I'm a person, I'm not just an empty seat, punch me I bleed." This scene is an awakening to directors who want to direct. I feel that scene has inspired me in a lot of ways. This scene also got me thinking about our love for Marvel Comics. The hero's in Marvel have other jobs besides saving people, and the "X-Men" are minority's just like other people on earth. We feel sorry for these characters, so in the end we love them more than anything. The DC Comics hero's are either rich or born rich, we can't really fell anything for them, so why should I care about Batman, or Catwoman. As I was watching the film, I realized that the screenwriters had skipped a few Spider-man comics. The film is focused on the morality and the mythology of "Spider-Man." I now know that I was watching the amazing Spider-Man unfold.<br /><br />This film is the new milestone to not only superhero films, but to all films. It not only redefines action films, but changes the way we look at a person and a hero. I LOVE THIS FILM, I RECOMMEND IT.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Sensational"></head><body><p>This classic remains a sensational, psychological thriller over 25 years later.  The story remains the same but now it comes in fantastic high definition.  Stanley Kubrick's vision was different from how Stephen King originally wrote it.  Although it's Kubricks vision that makes this movie so enjoyable.<br /><br />Set in beautiful Colorado the story is dark in a bright environment.  Jack Nicholson plays an average father named Jack.  Jack has been unemployed for a few months and is trying to be a writer.  To further his writing he takes the opportunity to move his family to a desolate resort in the Rockies.  The resort closes during the Winter and hires Jack to be a caretaker during that period.<br /><br />Jack's son Danny has begun to exhibit abnormal behavior by making an imaginary friend out of his finger.  This friend tells Danny things that seem to exhibit a special ability.  Jack's wife Wendy just seems to want everything to go right in their lives.  Unfortunately the move to the resort is the worst thing that can happen.<br /><br />Most of the acting is excellent in this movie and the scenes are still scary at times.  Even though movies have become more action packed and fast paced The Shining still shines.  That is why movies like this get even better with time.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version is okay.  The remaster is not the best I have seen for an older movie.  The picture is more defined but still not what I would like to see.  I am not going to mark down the score since this movie is too good for that.  The picture is better and the price is right.  For people who want to add a wonderful classic to their Blu-ray collection, The Shining is quite the movie to have.  For the price it can't be beat.</p></body></html>

For people who aren't entirely familiar or were just somewhat familiar on the events, but were maybe lacking some of the details, these documentaries that aired on the Discovery Channel were most informative. As a result, the experience left my wife and I wanting to watch some space related movies, and first on our list was the 1995 box office hit "Apollo 13" from director Ron Howard ("Ransom"), starring Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"), Ed Harris ("National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets"), and Kevin Bacon ("Death Sentence").<br /><br />"Apollo 13" chronicles the fateful mission that has been dubbed the "successful failure" by NASA, which had all of America holding its collective breath as it wondered if the mission would end in disaster or would it become one of our finest hours. When the space craft transporting Astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), to the moon suffers a catastrophic accident, the mission and the lives of the Astronauts are instantly changed. Now, the once moon-bound ship is left severely crippled, and what began as a seemingly routine mission to the moon has now become a rescue mission as the Houston-based members of NASA's Mission Control are racing against time and almost impossible odds to return these three men safely to Earth.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard had established himself as a fairly solid director in the early 90's with hits such as "Backdraft" and "Far and Away" under his belt, but it wasn't until the release of "Apollo 13" that he was able to firmly cement himself as a much sought after, critically-acclaimed director. Relying on state-of-the-art (as of 1995) special effects and film tricks and techniques to simulate weightlessness, along with an incredibly emotional and compelling story written by William Broyles, Jr. ("Flags of Our Fathers") and Al Reinert, based on the book written by Astronaut Jim Lovell and co-writer Jeffrey Kluger; Ron Howard has crafted one of the best and completely realistic movies I have ever seen to focus on one of NASA's missions in space.<br /><br />The cast of "Apollo 13" was an assortment of top-notch talent, such as; Tom Hanks, who made this film on the heels of his smash hit "Forrest Gump", Kevin Bacon ("Death Sentence"), Gary Sinise (who had co-starred alongside Hanks in "Forrest Gump"), Kathleen Quinlan ("Breakdown"), Bill Paxton ("Tombstone"), and Ed Harris. Each member of the cast portrayed these real life Astronauts, their wives, or the people in Mission Control perfectly, easily handling each emotional high and low throughout this inspiring story of survival.<br /><br />The well-written screenplay, expert direction, and extremely talented cast brought to life not only this harrowing journey in space, but also gave audiences a glimpse into what NASA life is like for the Astronauts and the loved ones left behind on Earth awaiting their safe return. Thanks to the painstaking length to which Ron Howard and company went to in order to make this a movie that is so incredibly realistic on every level, "Apollo 13" serves as a fitting tribute to the brave men and women that endured the situation by overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds, and also to the ingenuity and will power of man to set their sights on a goal and to never give up until it was achieved.<br /><br />"Apollo 13" is rated PG for language and peril.</p></body></html>

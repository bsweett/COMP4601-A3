It wasn't that long ago I saw this, was stunned by its originality and celebration of life. I've wanted to review this for so long, but it vanished so quickly, I only saw it once, thus I could never recall its name or who was in it!<br /><br />Thelonious "Theo" Faron (Clive Owen) is a sort of alcoholic numbskull suffering from shattered dreams and 20 years of lonely misery. It is circa 2028, very clever because the terrible blight on humanity began in 2008. Theo, who lost a daughter that he had with fellow radical activist Julian (Julianne Moore), is interested only in drinking.<br /><br />Suddenly, Julian contacts him. She wants him to escort someone out of England (presumably - it's a murky storyline and that is not good). Before he can agree or disagree, he's up to his neck in the transportation of a young Ghanaian immigrant named Kee (the beautiful Clare-Hope Ashitey) who is I believe 18 years old.<br /><br />This is a future without children, a totalitarian, mean, rotten future that deserves to die off - Britain's borders have been closed nearly a decade, and immigrants get the NAZI treatment. The women all suddenly became barren - and no one knows why. Kee is one of the last teenagers on earth AND an illegal immigrant. Everyone else is, well, over-the-hill and either British or illegal.<br /><br />I know the feeling, and can commiserate with the illegal immigrants.<br /><br />Our sweet young Ghanaian, Kee, is pregnant. This is not only a miracle, it is unbelievable to the characters. (Theo asks Kee who the father of the baby is, and for a brief, tense moment, she teases him and says there was no father. Hilarious!)<br /><br />There is an important new group of radicals called the "Fishes" - they ought to have been called the "Fish" because an individual is called a "Fish". Native-born British women are called "Cod". Headed by the semi-villainous Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the Fishes are fighting the totalitarian government. What they really want is Kee's baby to use almost as a weapon.<br /><br />The rest I will not spoil. This film is stunning not only for its socio-philosophical depth; the effects are a marvel no other director has matched. Sine I paid no attention to credits, I assume Cuaron shot much of this as well as directing. It is the best, most mind-boggling cinematography I've seen. Cuaron weaves, ducks and runs with the camera like an on-the-spot disaster report, but he does it so naturally, so smoothly, that there isn't even any vertigo. Your eyes will follow this naturally.<br /><br />My HUGE pet peeve with all modern film is the damnable 'wobbly-camera' syndrome. Cuar&oacute;n has something to teach the world about using this technique CORRECTLY. Where he picked it up, I have no idea - all I know is that Cuaron is jockeying to become one of our greatest directors. I think we can take that to the bank.<br /><br />The cast of this film is a delight: Michael Caine does a cameo as Theo's ancient hippie friend Jasper (I love the running joke about Jasper's latest invention: "Strawberry Cough" marijuana) -  note this was a kind of comeback for Caine. The gorgeous Charlie Hunnam is Patric, one of the Fishes and a nasty one at that. Pam Ferris is Miriam, a New Age nun who travels with Theo and Kee, and this is a very interesting character I quite loved.<br /><br />Danny Huston as (the instrumental cameo) Nigel, Jacek Koman as Tomasz, and the great Peter Mullan as Syd round out this terrific cast. Now ... don't go looking for a whole lot of background explanation or in-depth dialogue. The clues as to what is occurring are all around you, very little referred to in dialogue which I think is brilliant - but it can be a headache since nothing is clearly explained.<br /><br />Usually with this in-the-near-future type story, we want to know how that future descends from our time. Rarely do we get it. At least here, Cuaron ahs given us a one-line explanation: women are barren and no one knows why. The effects of that are catastrophic, as you will see abundantly in this brilliant and sadly forgotten film.<br /><br />Aside from some action-violence (should be studied in film school) and if you can somehow tune out the occasional swearing, this is a great family film (definitely not for the very young, teens on up, I think). It's so gorgeous and thought-provoking that you have to have the violence ... otherwise, how can the lesson be taught?<br /><br />One last thing: while the religious people (there are few) are either New Wave or Catholic, there is no special significance to the prayer/greeting "Shanti, Shanti, Shanti". "Shanti" is Sanskrit/Hindu for "peace", so it is like saying "Shalom". The New Wave folk pray the ancient Hindu Shanti prayer (for so it is) - and that's all. Make of that what you will. Interestingly, the Catholics cross themselves.<br /><br />Get this and enjoy it over and over - it is a classic you'll regret not buying.</p></body></html>

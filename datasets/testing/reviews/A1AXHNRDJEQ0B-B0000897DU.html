<meta name="summary" content="Not as bad as some reviews might have you think..."></head><body><p>Most people's enjoyment of a movie depends on their expectations: if you've expected a masterpiece & gotten something that doesn't meet your criteria of a good film, you'll be disappointed, even if the movie itself isn't so bad in any other way. If you're expecting a bad movie & discover a few unexpected good things in it (such as acting, for instance), you'll enjoy it far more than expected.<br /><br />'8 miles'may not be a masterpiece and may not be that original, plot wise. But it does expose people who were unaware of certain aspects of life in the neighborhoods this movie shows. Many people see some character & plot points as cliches - but these cliches are often based on real life truths...<br /><br />Eminem is a surprisingly good actor, and the rap parts are enjoyable even for people who are not devoted fans of the genre.</p></body></html>

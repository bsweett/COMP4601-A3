<meta name="summary" content="Darjeeling?  I'd rather have Earl Gray (hot)"></head><body><p>The Darjeeling Limited is an extremely odd and quirky little film.  The cinematography is beautiful in both location and detail. The Darjeeling Limited itself is quite exotic and colorful, and provides us a unique look at train travel in India.  Additionally, native citizens of India are used throughout the film, which adds weight to the authentic feel. However lovely, though, the plot and character development are things left to be desired.<br /><br />The plot is a rambling stream of consciousness that barely held my interest at the time, and, in retrospect, wasn't that interesting after all.  The character development is thin at best, leaving the audience scratching their proverbial heads as to who these people are, how they are related, and why we should care. (Eventually you get it, but it takes far too long.)  The acting is passable but predictable:  Owen Wilson is a jerk and drives his family nuts, Adrien Brody just looks depressed and brow beaten, and Jason Schwartzman has no depth whatsoever as the youngest, skirt chasing brother.<br /><br />I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.  But nothing about this film made me CARE about it, so I really cannot recommend it.</p></body></html>

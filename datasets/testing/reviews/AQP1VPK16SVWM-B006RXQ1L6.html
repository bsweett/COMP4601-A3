<meta name="summary" content="Rob Marshall's film dazzles"></head><body><p>Film is a harsh mistress. Every imperfection is magnified a million times and, the worst part, permanently recorded for all the world to see. That's why Chicago is a pleasant surprise. Director Rob Marshall in collaboration with the other performers/artists involved with the film, has turned in one of the best movie musicals since the heyday of wunderkind Bob Fosse.<p>Based on the Kander &amp; Ebb musical directed by maverick choregraphy Bob Fosse, Chicago manages to capture Fosse's spirit and make the transition from stage musical to film. That's a rarity since the &quot;death&quot; of the film musical. Rob Marshall manages to translate CHicago from one medium to another because he understands both and doesn't undercut the strengths of either medium; the musical numbers are mobile, well edited and choregraphed and he manages to integrate the mobility of film with the necessary static elements of the original stage play.<p>Although Marshall's choregrapher owes a great debt to Fosse's original work, it's uniquely his own. What's most surprising is that Marshall isn't afraid to tweak and play with the most successful elements from his stage version for the film.  Marshall keeps the original story intact. Zellweger and Zeta-Jones play, respectively, wanna-be caberet performer and the real deal who end up in prison after committing murder. Zellweger murders her lover who had promised to help her breakthrough into performing after he reveals he had no connections and was just using her for sex. <p>Zeta-Jones murders her husband and sister (her partner in their musical act)when they are caught in the act --quite literally--of commiting adultry. Thrown together due to their circumstances, Zellweger and Zeta-Jones circle like wary predators unclear on the concept of trust. They both want the same goal but it's clear that they both will do anything to reach their goals. The fact that the media rewards them with sympathetic portrayals in the paper due to their money hungry lawyer (Richard Gere)makes this trip down the dark side even more interesting.<p>Ren&eacute;e Zellweger (playing Roxie Hart) and Catherine Zeta-Jones both sparkle in their film debt as dancers and singers. While neither one has great voices, they are appropriate to the material. In fact, their strong backgrounds as actors add an element that might be missing from technically more gifted singers. Yes, they play amoral characters and, yes, none of the characters really have any socially redeeming values but they represent the very qualities that this cynical but witty look at media manipulation is all about.<p>Richard Gere is especially noteworthy. I'm not surprised that Gere's performance is so strong given his background in Broadway musical performances. What is surprising is that he'd take such a risky (but colorful) role so late in his career. His gold digging lawyer is every bit a manipulator as Roxie Hart(Zellweger). John C. O'Riley is a bit of a surprise. While he's a terrific actor, I never pictured him as a singer. He acquits himself quite well in a memorable musical number. O'Riley plays Roxie's dimwitted husband with a heart of gold. He's the only decent person in the whole film and the one everyone twists around for their own unjust cause. <p>The Kanter &amp; Ebb songs are great. Fred Ebb's lyrics are witty and among the best he had written. Kanter's music is also a highlight. It's clear that Chicago is every bit the equal (although smaller in scope)of their classic Cabaret. If Chicago isn't quite as powerful as Fosse's film version of Cabaret or even All That Jazz, it's due to the smaller scope of the story. It's equally entertaining though. <p>The transfer is terrific with the crisp picture and colors captured vividly in this DVD transfer. The sound transfer is rich although there is some noticable compression in a couple of scenes. The behind the scenes featurette isn't anything special but does provide some insight into the challenges of translating a successful musical from one medium to another. The widescreen version preserves the original aspect ratio. Although I've always been a fan of widescreen, the standard full screen version is nicely done as well. Since this film is about the onscreen dancing and singing, there's some picture loss but it won't be noticable to most folks.</p></body></html>

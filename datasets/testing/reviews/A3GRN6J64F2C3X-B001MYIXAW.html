<meta name="summary" content="Effective, understated horror"></head><body><p>"Let The Right One In" is a thoughtful, introspective movie about an unusual friendship, peppered with some effective and striking horror imagery.  While not overly ambiguous, the film definitely leaves it up to the viewer to decide if the young boy's friendship with the undead girl is ultimately a good or bad thing.  A brief subplot involving a middle-aged woman who survives an attack by the girl and starts transforming into a vampire herself is a memorable addition to the film.  Especially recommended for those who like their horror set against a backdrop of mundane, realistically presented daily life.  The standard DVD looks and sounds fine, and gives the viewer the option of seeing the film in the original Swedish with English subtitles, or dubbed in English.  There is also a handful of interesting special features about the making of the film.</p></body></html>

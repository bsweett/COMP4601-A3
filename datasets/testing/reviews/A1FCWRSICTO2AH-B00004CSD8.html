<meta name="summary" content="OK remake"></head><body><p>This remake is probably better than a lot of other recent horror remakes (Amityville Horror, The Fog), but the Why of it still remains.  For example, as bad as the new Amityville was, it did attempt to provide an update in script.  It still stunk, but you could at least sense that the scriptwriters were trying to jazz the new version up.  With the new Omen, you have a very faithful remake, but without the gravitas of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick to heighten the horror.  Liev Schieber and Julia Stiles are pretty good, and the script writers were actually clever in explaining how Schieber could land the plum ambassoder post (he's the president's godson), but this isn't enough to compare with the older Peck's growing awareness and horror of just who his son might be. (And let's face it, Peck looked like an Ambassador.)  Then there was Lee Remick.  No one had eyes like Lee Remick, especially when she was using them to express alarm and terror.  She was a great actress.  In contrast, especially if you've seen the original, Stiles and Schieber look like 30 somethings playing house.<br /><br />As far as the devil kid, Damien, he could have been a CGI representative from the first one, I couldn't tell (which should give you an idea as to how slick this new version is).  He really makes very little impression, and I seem to recall the original kid as at least radiating malevolence.  Also, and somewhat slavish, is how David Thewlis as the freelance photographer seems to have been cast for the part because he faintly resembles David Warner, right down to the nervous mannerisms.  Come on, at least let the actors bring something new to the table!  The one standout performance is Mia Farrow as the evil Mrs. Baylock.  The original had Billie Whitelaw playing Mrs. Baylock, and she was outstanding, so Farrow had to come up with a fine performance to at least match Whitelaw's diabolic effort.  The good news is that she does quite well with the part, and it serves as the one attempt at a departure from the original.  You could do worst with this new Omen, but you could do better - by seeing the original film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Boring. Too slow paced. Lame effects. Poor Plot."></head><body><p>What is the big deal with M. Night Shyamalan? He can't write, can barely direct, and his movies are uninspiring bores.<br /><br />About 20% of this movie was tolerable.  I thought I was going to wear out the FF button on my DVD remote!<br /><br />IF you want mystery, adventure, or action, you'd find more watching paint dry.  Although paint drying would probably hold your interest longer than any part of this movie.<br /><br />Way over-rated.</p></body></html>

This movie is so much fun you have to count the smiles whiles its on.  Sometimes the smile is because they just said something stupid, like alien abduction or Rosewell.  Sure this has more amazing coincidences than a James Bond movie.  <p>There is no nudity and I recall only one foul expletive.<p>I thought Jeff Goldbloom was great in this movie and if there was any doubt about Wil Smiths shotting star, this movie ended that.</p></body></html>

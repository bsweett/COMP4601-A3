If you have, then The Book of Eli is it. If you haven't - see it anyway. You'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The sensational Denzel Washington stars as Eli. He's a lonely drifter wondering the streets of a morally and economically abandoned America. After a great war that tore a hole in the sky and upset the balance of the sun, the world more or less came to an end.<br /><br />That was over 30 years ago and Eli has been walking ever since. He, like those few who survived, cannot go outside without shades on; as the sky has turned to a desolate burnt mass that will blind you. The brilliant filmmakers (Albert and Allen Hughes) who brought us From Hell; have crafted a very unique and appealing-to-the-cinematic-eye, landscape for Denzel's character to trek across.<br /><br />Eli has one mission: to protect a sacred book that he has in his possession, and to take it west. Faith is his employer; faith in the heavenly voice that has told him to do so.<br /><br />Please don't make the ignorant mistake that others have made by assuming that it has taken him 30 years to walk from A to B. His path has been unknown to him, as is all of ours in life, and those 30 years were spent with him learning from and experiencing things of which the film does not need to show us. Plus, his path leads him to a place where he interacts with certain characters that would not have been there 30 years ago or even 15 years ago, and he needs to meet them in order for his destiny to be fulfilled entirely.<br /><br />This is a very religious film, if you didn't pick up on it from the beginning of this review or from the advertising. Eli is being led by God, okay. I know it's a movie, but films of the past have asked us to accept much more unbelievable elements and we all have; so just go with it and have some fun.<br /><br />Eli is met along the way by sadistic motorcycle gangs and rapists and thieves; really bad guys. People butcher and slaughter one another for food, water, sex and whatever else you may have to offer them. Eli partakes in none of this, and handles those who oppose his goal appropriately to his situation and to the genre of this film - he kills them; violently, innovatively, and in very entertaining ways.<br /><br />If you are some-one who believes strongly that violence is never the answer, no matter what the situation, then skip this film and go watch Sesame Street instead. It's jam-packed with violence; justified violence. Let's face it - sometimes the only way to counter violence, is to retaliate with even more of it. That's a fact folks.<br /><br />Eventually Eli stumbles into a town run by a heinous dictator. Who better to play a grizzly villain, than the villain's villain himself: Gary Oldman. From Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Fifth Element, to True Romance and The Professional, Oldman has portrayed some of the most celebrated movie-psychotics of all time. He adds The Book of Eli to that list with another phenomenal performance as Carnegie.<br /><br />Carnegie is the guy you have seen a thousand times in different westerns; the bully who has taken over the town and has his own personal henchman, and is forcing a beautiful woman to be his love interest. But it's the sadistic charm that Oldman brings to this character that sets him apart from others. He is magnificent and terrifying.<br /><br />Carnegie's agenda is to get his hands on a sacred book that he believes will grant him power to rule everyone left alive on our miserable planet. The book is of course the one which Eli possesses.<br /><br />When Eli wonders into Carnegie's town for supplies, he finds some trouble. After a bloody battle is had, leaving Eli victorious, Carnegie is impressed with his skills and wishes to hire him as part of his crew. When Eli refuses, Carnegie grants him a free night in his hotel with a generous meal, in hopes of persuading him. Eli accepts the offer and stays the night.<br /><br />Jennifer Beals gives a terrific performance as Claudia, that woman being forced into Carnegie's life that we discussed earlier. Her daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) is forced to work in the saloon and sometimes provide sexual favors to guests. Carnegie forces her to offer herself to Eli, in one of the film's best and most enduring scenes.<br /><br />Obviously, Eli declines her gesture and befriends her instead. The two create a strong partnership and flee from Carnegie and his group of degenerate dirt-bags. Naturally they follow, and several interesting interactions are had before the film reaches its end.<br /><br />The violence in the film will no doubt confuse many, as that's all they will see it as. They will miss the fact that Eli is on a quest from God, and never once invites an altercation upon himself. Eli is always grief stricken or warn-down by his acts of violence and finds no pleasure in them.<br /><br />There is one scene in the film where he does kill an unarmed man, but I believe that he either does this because God tells him to, as the guy is evil and will murder others as he has just attempted to do to Eli; or he does this because of the simple fact that the man will bleed to death, in the middle of no-where, as a result of the injury he has sustained.<br /><br />You'll be impressed to know that Denzel did al of his own stunts in this film, and trained severely to make these action sequences look believable. They do.<br /><br />The Book of Eli also has one of the most original endings ever seen in any film; right up there with the shock-value of The Sixth Sense. Watching it a second time, makes it as equally painstakingly obvious with clues, but hardly anyone will ever catch it the first time around.<br /><br />It's good to see a big Hollywood-backed movie that evokes a strong Christian theme. You don't catch too many of those. Eli gives a terrific quote in the film that has and will continue to stick with me: "There's always a choice."</p></body></html>

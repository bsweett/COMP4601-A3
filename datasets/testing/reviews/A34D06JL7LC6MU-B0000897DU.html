<meta name="summary" content="One of My Favorite Movies"></head><body><p>As much as I like this movie, I don't own it. So, I see it every now and then, by borrowing it from a neighbor or something. So,<br /><br />recently I saw this movie for like the 50eth time. I still really like this movie. Eminem is one of the few singers who can seamlessly cross over from singing to acting. I do however think that we will probably never see Eminem in another movie. The only reason I saw this movie was due to the fact that I liked Eminem, but the movie holds on its own, but Eminem does real well. I've read a couple reviews where people said: "Oh, Eminem is just playing himself, it's not even a performance."  In a sense he is playing himself. But what people don't realize is that playing yourself is sometimes harder to do then playing someone else. This movie is very very loosely based on accounts in Eminems life, so people need to stop saying its a biography. It's NOT! Anyway, Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr, or Jimmy, or<br /><br />Rabbit, or B-Rabbit, or yet again, Bunny Rabbit. Rabbit is (obviously) a white rapper living in Detroit who heads to the Shelter, a rap club, almost every night and gets stage fright, or chokes. Whatever you want to call it. The only person who sees how talented Rabbit really is, is Future(Mekhi Phifer,<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead). Future is kind of Rabbits mentor. Like Mr.Miyagi was to Daniel in "The Karate Kid". Rabbit lives at home with his mom (Kim Basinger, The Door in the Floor) and his sister Lilly. The sister is semi-based on Eminems daughter Hailie. He works at a stamping factory and thats where he meets<br /><br />Alex (Brittany Murphy, Little Black Book). Alex is kind of a free spirited...Sl*t. To say the least ya know. So, we have:<br /><br />Rabbits Mom: Based on Ems Mom. Except the love in this movie is a lot stronger.<br /><br />Alex: Seems to be a little like Kim. Anyone?<br /><br />Lilly:Hailie?<br /><br />So, yes. In a sense its a biography. But this is a very entertaining and terrific film. You don't have to like rap, you don't have to like Eminem. But you should like this film.A+</p></body></html>

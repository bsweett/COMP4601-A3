<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant sequel!"></head><body><p>Well, The Bride is back to defeat Bill's gang once and for all! This time, she must defeat the remaining three on the List.<br /><br /> I loved it. As good as the first, KB2 has less action, more storytelling. Of course that's not a bad thing. We get to know The Bride's real name, plus we get to see Bill for the first time! There's a lot of suspense, like when one of Bill's henchman burys The Bride alive!<br /><br /> This is an epic trioligy. Add it to your DVD collection!</p></body></html>

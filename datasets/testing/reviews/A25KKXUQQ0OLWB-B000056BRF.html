<meta name="summary" content="A Great Film!  A Spectacle!"></head><body><p>This is one of the great "big" movies from film history.  A wonderful story about a Judean man named Ben Hur who ends up being accused of plotting against the Romans and comes out on top only to be a witness to the crucifixion of Christ.  Not overly religious nor secular, gets the tone right so it can be enjoyed by everyone.  This version topped the original and the chariot race is a major highlight of the film  Charelton Heston is Ben Hur and plays it straight.  That's Ok, the film needed a guy like him.  Wonderful movie.  Even better in the movie theatre.</p></body></html>

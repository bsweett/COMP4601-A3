<meta name="summary" content="A Little Better The Second Time Around"></head><body><p>This movie is much better because it had what the first movie didn't have. A more sensible plot, better actors&actresses and better acting. This time, The Transporter acts as chaffeur to a rich couple's son who he adores. The when the son is kidnapped that is when the real fun begins. Plenty of action and martial arts. If you hated the first movie this will turn you around.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Grim, indeed..."></head><body><p>Terry Gilliam is not unlike Tim Burton; both have an highly visual (rather than verbal) approach to telling stories. The story itself is less important than the imagery it inspires in their minds. So they sometimes choose weak or thin scripts (eg, "Edward Scissorhands", "Baron Munchausen"). "The Brothers Grimm" is, unfortunately, one of those weak scripts.<br /><br />The idea of the Grimms being con artists who take advantage of their knowledge of M&auml;rchen to defraud people by exorcising "spirits" of their own creation is farcical, which works against the seriousness of the real-life horror story they're dragged into. This might have worked if Gilliam had gradually adjusted the film's tone from light to dark, but he fails to do this -- there are too many comic characters and too much humor throughout. We're not sure whether this is a comedy or a scary fairy tale. It winds up being not much of either.<br /><br />There is one moment of marvelous pre-irony (???). After Jakob (Heath Ledger) has restored Angelika with a kiss of "true love", Angelika suggests that he do the same to his seemingly dead brother Wilhelm! Ledger tentatively leans over to deliver the buss, but Wilhelm (Matt Damon) awakes and tells him not to. And in the commentary for a deleted scene, Terry Gilliam remarks that it was removed because it rendered the film's structure "broken-backed". Weird.<br /><br />"The Brothers Grimm" is worth seeing once, simply for its magnificent cinematography and production design. But it's not very satisfying as either a comedy or a fantasy.</p></body></html>

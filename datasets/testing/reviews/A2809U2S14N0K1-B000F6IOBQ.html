<meta name="summary" content="Disappointed"></head><body><p>I generally like this type of horror story and I very much enjoyed the first one. So I was very disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />The story I thought was fairly weak, the acting, I thought was quite poor. Kate Beckinsale does not do nearly as good a job as she did in the previous one.<br /><br />The special effects are okay. Nothing really brilliant.<br /><br />If I had not liked the first one so much, I probably would not have bothered to see the end of this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An intelligent horror movie!"></head><body><p>With all due respect to the reviewer Shashank, this movie was never meant to appeal to the fluffy scarefest audience of recent years... the "Ringu" crowd. Ideally, the audience that will find this movie a refreshing change of pace will be those of us over the age of 35 (like Ebert and Roper... WAY over 35).<br /><br />And as for Shashank's "WMDs in Iraq" comment.... guess what? If one took a room full of biological agents, and hid them in a region as big as California... it would be near impossible to find this buried supply. One cannot prove they are present, but this doesn't remove all suspicion that they are there.<br /><br />Which leads me to the case concerning  possession and exorcism... the evidence regarding the reality of these things is minimal... albeit greater than most people realize. But keep this slogan in mind... "THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE is NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE."<br /><br />If something remains "unproven"... whether it's current WMDs in Iraq or the actual possession of the girl given the pseudonym "Emily Rose"... one is NOT compelled to believe in such things. Yes, doubt and skepticism are healthy. Transversely, one cannot definitively DISMISS the reality of such things. They remain UNPROVEN, not DISPROVEN.<br /><br />Also, there are evidences that fall short of "absolute proof," but they are still evidences of value. I have personally heard the recorded voice contortions during the exorcism this movie is based on, and it would be the type of rasp that would hurt a normal throat after five minutes. This seemingly possessed girl would go on and on in this gutteral voice for hours.<br /><br />The movie plunges into actual theology, much as the original "Exorcist" novel did decades ago. I'm glad to see the return of intelligent horror. For me, a scary movie is actually scarier when it's not slapping us with a startling scene every three minutes. Less is more!!<br /><br />Crawling, decaying corpses and cgi- effects are out there, for the new generation of fluff movie goers. It's nice to have a movie for us older people on occasion.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

He went into the Alaskan wilderness and came out a deity to be reckoned with! He made the decision to forego all personal wealth, in search of the ultimate answer! It's SOOOOO romantic, I want to cry. ALL of you folk who didn't like this film just didn't get it!! You are people incapable of dreaming the BIG dream!! This story is so inspirational, only those who understand Chris' journey toward enlightenment can truly call themselves devotees of His Divine Majesty!!<br /><br />His Family were worthless money-grubbers, His Mother was so out of touch with reality, and seeing his Father cry, at the end was so emotional (NOT). His "friends" just refused to accept that there are more important things than living on a slab of cement, out in the middle of nowhere, marking time, not caring that communing with the higher power is more important than life, itself!! And the old man? He just represented to Chris all that is wrong with humanity!! Leave all his worldly possessions to a man who has forsaken it? Was he nuts? Chris was above all that, the old coot was too stupid to see it!!<br /><br />When he reached Alaska, the vistas were beautiful!! It sure looked as though it was tough to be there, but Chris just KNEW what to do!! Yes, he made a mistake shooting that moose, but it was an honest one, and he can't be faulted for not knowing how to preserve the meat. He was just a displaced city kid, after all. His run-in with the bear had the hair on the back of my neck standing up!! It's a wonder he wasn't mauled or eaten. I guess the bear realized that Chris' journey wasn't over, yet!! I cried when he found out he ate those poisoned roots, but happy, too, because his story wouldn't have been so inspiring!! He died a HERO! No doubt about it!!<br /><br />You will have to forgive the one star rating. As of now, I would give this film 100 stars!! This is entertainment at it's finest!! Sean Penn captured the essence that was Christopher McCandless expertly, as an enlightened Director/Producer should!! I am ashamed to have thought that Christopher McCandless was anything but a GOD!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You're never too young for ultra-violence ... or are you?"></head><body><p>So in what world is it *not* a monstrous notion for a father to train his 11-year-old daughter to be a mass murderer? In the world of "Kick-Ass," of course.<br /><br />I don't shy away from violent movies at all, at least as long as the violence carries some sense of satire, irony, justice or is just flat-out entertaining.<br /><br />But even in the glossiest, most colorful fiction, I just can't get behind the idea of a child, led by a parent, to kill dozens of others in the blood-thirstiest ways available. Especially when those actions are presented as heroic, noble and occasionally bunny-cute. To add insult to countless injuries, the filmmakers' calculated desire to seem audacious and spark controversy is completely transparent.<br /><br />That isn't the least of the film's problems, but it's a large one among many. The film also has a dull lead character, seriously sloppy cinematography and too many confused ideas about what it's trying to say. Half the time it wants to subvert the superhero mythology, the rest of the time it exemplifies the genre at its worst.<br /><br />There's also an eager, trying-way-too-hard masochism to the brutality that reminded me of another recent bad movie, "Wanted." Which, coincidentally, was also by comic book writer and artist Mark Millar, and which also casually tossed around the notion that if a geek wants to leave behind the life of a loser, he only has to get a gun and start shooting. Bad idea jeans.<br /><br />p.s. I'm willing to bet people who drop negative votes on this review either didn't read the whole thing, didn't understand it, haven't seen enough movies, are 12 years old or all of the above.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hairspray and Latex"></head><body><p>I've now seen this story in three forms--the Broadway musical, which I loved, even at $110 per ticket; the'80s Hairspray movie on DVD; and the 2007 theatrical release. The current movie musical follows the path of the Broadway musical, keeping most of the songs and adding a couple others. Nikki Blonsky, the young actress who plays the indomitable Tracy Turnblad, is terrific, but much of the adult cast suffers from star-studdedness, primarily in the Latex-laden form of John Travolta as Tracy's mom, Edna Turnblad. The use of a male actor is the role isn't unprecedented. Actually, it's the standard, as transvestite actress Divine played the role in the '80s movie, and a variety of overweight male actors have played the role on Broadway. Still, big screen size and HD-clarity on made-up pores in Travolta face and petrochemical molecules in his fat suit distracted me from enjoying "Hairspray" as much as I could. (He did do a good job researching and trying to maintain a Baltimore accent.)<br /><br />Supporting roles were filled with non-singing stars as well--particularly Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle; Christopher Walken as jokester father Wilbur Turnblad. The romantic song and dance featuring Travolta and Walken is pretty hard to watch. Still, the DVD costs a lot less than a Broadway ticket, and you get to hear the incomparable opening number, "Good Morning, Baltimore," and the rousing closing number "You Can't Stop The Beat," along with some energetic singing and dancing from younger and less famous members of the cast, which is more entertainment than a lot of movies offer. This one might even be better on the small screen, where Travolta's Edna won't be quite so enormously alarming. Three stars.</p></body></html>

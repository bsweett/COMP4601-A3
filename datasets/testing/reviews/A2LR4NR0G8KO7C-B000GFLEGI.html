<meta name="summary" content="Mad Max imitation with zombies"></head><body><p>This is an unnecessary movie really. It beats me why Romero felt like making another zombiemovie after I watched it. The story line of the dead picking up some human tricks like shooting guns looks very silly. I think last year's remake of Dawn of the dead should have been a nice conclusion of the zombiemovies for the next 10 years. This movie isn't even scary anymore...it is like watching an action movie with zombies. Was this Romero's attempt to show everyone he still can make a better zombiemovie then any other director? If so, he shouldn't have bothered. (SARR)</p></body></html>

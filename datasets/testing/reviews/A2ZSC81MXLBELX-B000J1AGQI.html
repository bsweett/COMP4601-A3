Other movies of this genre, exceptional films like "Apocalypse Now", "Platoon" or even "The Green Beret" focus on a message of either anti or pro the Viet Nam war. This movie focus on the brave soldiers who fought and the families they left behind. It is the story of Lt. Col.Hal Moore played by Mel Gibson and his troops as they are among the first Americans to be in battle against North Viet Nam in the early stages of the war.<br />After the opening scenes of the men finding out they will be deployed and some very touching moments as they spend their last few days with their families, they leave for their target, the la Drang Valley. The encounters with the North Vietnamese are very violent and graphic, but depict the horror that these men went through. There is a poignant moment where a photographer (Barry Pepper) who has been put in the position of fighting, lays his gun down, picks up his camera and shoots the atrocities he see around him. (By the way this photographer, Joe Galloway co authored with Moore the book this film is based on.)<br />On the other side of the world, while these brave men fight, the wives have already started recieving the dreaded telegrams. You cannot help but feel for these grieving woman and their families.<br />This film is a real tribute to the Viet Nam Vets, and they should be remembered well.<br />The cast also includes Sam Elliot as the rough gruff Sgt Major, Madeline Stowe as Moore's wife, and with Greg Kinnear and Chris Klein. It was directed by Randall Wallace (writer of Braveheart)<br />The DVD (Paramount Widescreen Collection) is 5 stars in my book. Excellent cinematography, the 5.1 surround sound was perfect, I felt like the war was going on right in my living room,the widescreen picture was top rate, even the night time scenes were clear and bright. If you have already seen this movie and are wondering about the DVD go for it! There are lots of extra goodies too, including commentary,deleted scenes and behind the scenes. There are subtitles in English for those that may need them. If you havn't seen it and like war movies, (this one is very graphic, so it is not for the sensitive)you will be captivated by this one.<br />thanx laurie</p></body></html>

But John Travolta steals the whole movie . He is fully in drag as Enda, Tracy's mom. But he can dance & sing for real. Some well known faces such as Michelle Phieffer, Chris Walken & others lend support. The plot? Dross. The dancing is the thing. Very good original rock n' roll style muscic & singing. Great live & pretty good on the larger stage of movies.</p></body></html>

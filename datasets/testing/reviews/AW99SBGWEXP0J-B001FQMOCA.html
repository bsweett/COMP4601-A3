<meta name="summary" content="Walk the Line"></head><body><p>"Walk the Line" is the story of Johnny Cash from his childhood in 1944 to the late 1960s.  As a child, we see two people that shaped his life: his brother and his father.  Skip ahead ten years, and Johnny Cash (Phoenix) is married to his wife, Viv (Goodwin), and has started a band.  After getting a record deal, he finds himself on tour with Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter (Witherspoon).  Along the way he finds drugs, which threaten his newfound popularity, and he falls in love with June, which just may save him.<br /><br />Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give excellent performances, sounding and acting just like the stars that they are portraying.  Phoenix is as good, if not better than Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in last year's "Ray".  The story is well told, and it is interesting to see the events that shaped Cash's life, and made him who he is.  Whether you are a Johnny Cash fan or not, "Walk the Line" is a highly entertaining and well made movie that is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

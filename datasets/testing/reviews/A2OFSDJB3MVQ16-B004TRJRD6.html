<meta name="summary" content="one of the scariest movies ever on Hi-Def!"></head><body><p>I read somewhere that Martin Scorsese compiled a list of the 10 most scariest movies of all time and I wouldn't be surprised if the 1974 shocker is on his list. Director William Friedkin assembled an excellent cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn (Oscar nominated), Lee J. Cobb, Jason Miller (Oscar nominated) and Max Von Sydow for this classic thriller. The disc is close to perfection with just a few scenes there is some grain but overall one will be pleased with this transfer--just don't watch this alone at night!</p></body></html>

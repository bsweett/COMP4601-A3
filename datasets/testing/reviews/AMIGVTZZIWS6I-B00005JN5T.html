With the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as the parents of Gaylord "Greg" Focker there are some truly hilarious moments in this film and they are just perfect as the parents of Ben Stiller's character.  The only funnier choice could have been Jerry Stiller and Ann Meara, Ben Stiller's real-life parents.  Regardless, Hoffman and Streisand are very funny as caricatures of former-hippy, bleeding-heart, Jewish liberals -- and they play it to the max.  Back, of course, are Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner as Jack and Dina Byrnes who just have a fantastic chemistry together.  The one weak link in the cast in Teri Polo as Pam, but she was also the weak link in the previous film.  She is just not funny.  She should stay with The West Wing where she has excellent chemistry with Jimmy Smits.  Overall, this was just a very funny film, and there were times when I actually found myself laughing out loud.</p></body></html>

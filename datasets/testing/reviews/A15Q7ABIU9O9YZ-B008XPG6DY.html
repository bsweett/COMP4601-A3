There seems to be a groundswell of reviewers who want to sink her. Reminds me of Cruise. Yet, they both do excellent work. Perhaps Ms. Aniston is seen as taking Julia Roberts place in terms of 'wholesomeness' and there's resentment afoot.<br /><br />I took away a star because Charlie Shine has everything going for him, beatiful family, true, a sick little girl, $700,000 dollar home, life is OK. So let's complicate life exponentially by hopping in the sack with an utter stranger you just met. Why is he so sad? What's wrong?<br /><br />If I'm going to go with something unbelievable, I'll take Michael Douglas sleeping with Glenn Close in FA. At least he made no bones about having a great life. Here, Clive Owen's marriage is in trouble but we never know why. It just didn't hang together for me.<br /><br />Victor Cassel. Brrr. Good villain. All in all, an enjoyable movie. It could have had more marketing muscle. There is one other thought. Is there something wrong with saying that possibly "rappers" lack acting skills?<br /><br />Way, Way back in the day, Hollywood would put the latest teen idol in a movie to act with John Wayne, Gregory Peck, whomever. We had Frankie Avalon in Navarone, Ricky Nelson in several of the Rio movies, and Glen Campbell in Rooster Cogburn. You know what? They were terrible. Frankie breaking into song at a Greek wedding surrounded by Nazis who want to slit their throats wasted the 60 previous minutes Peck and Niven worked for to make the movie suspenseful. So here's a caveat for the present. Rappers are great. They have a lot of followers. But they can't act. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

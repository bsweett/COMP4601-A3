I saw this in a typically sun shiny morning and I can tell you if you are up for a depressing yet wonderful film to jumpstart your day, I suggest Road to Perdition.<br /><br />The film is about a mob gangster Michael Sullivan who was betrayed by his boss bceause his son, Michael Jr inadvertently witnesses a murder. So, to tie all loose ends, mob boss John Rooney decides to kill his loyal right-hand man. But when Connor Rooney, John Rooney's son, mercilessly kills his family (only his older son Michael Jr surviving), he decides to go on a vendetta to avenge his family's death.<br /><br />The story is not your typical gangster film. There's no police cops to arrest mob bosses here nor drug cartels for that matter. The story is focused on Michael Sullivan's revenge on the people who betrayed him. Sam Mendes and the writers managed to excellently blend a father-and-child story angle in a gangster themed story.<br /><br />The performances were great. Tom Hanks as usual delivers, Jude Law unexpectedly sent chills down to my ancestors as a creepy looking psychopath/photographer. Paul Newman as the aging mob boss was great as well. One minute you hate him for betraying his loyal right-hand man, the next minute you don't want him to die soaking wet.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, before James Bond, portrayed an annoying scheming mischievous son to a mob boss. He had it coming to him. Yes, he was spot on with his performance too.<br /><br />The best scene in the entire film would probably be when Michael Sullivan ambushed John Rooney and his mob thugs drenched in rain. Sam Mendes did this slow-mo shot when Michael was shooting them with a machine gun in a distant house and the thugs were like dropping like flies and John was by the car, with his head down realizing his grim fate. Michael killed all of them except John. So, he approached him with gun in his hand, John turns to him, almost into tears and utters what probably is the best line of the film: "I'm glad its you". Michael with a sad look then shoots him down.<br /><br />That scene will stay in my head forever. It was emotional, sad, depressing and it almost wanna make you cry but somehow you feel that the Michael character is doing the right thing. Very poetic scene to be remembered for ages.</p></body></html>

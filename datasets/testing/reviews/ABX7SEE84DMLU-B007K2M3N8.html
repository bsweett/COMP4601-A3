<meta name="summary" content="When You Can Do As You Please"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey has reached the stage of his career allowing him to do virtually anything he wants.  He deserves this opportunity to fulfill a long ambition.<br /><br />Why is he so taken with the story of Bobby Darin?  Well, it's got something to do with his mother, I heard.<br /><br />In this movie, an exceptionally talented man gets to extend that into not only acting, but also dancing and singing.  There are no false notes in the singing (even if it is not exactly what you remember of Bobby Darin's craft).  The dancing is spectacular.<br /><br />So why is this labelled "narcissistic" by some here?  Acting itself is inherently narcissism, isn't it?  We react to Kevin Spacey's exercise here by resisting any sort of change - people will do that.<br /><br />I was no fan of Bobby Darin, honestly.  But there were moments in this movie that were so amazing and so beautiful that they take your breath away.  It's not just about good acting, good dancing, good singing.  It's so clear here that this was a work of an honest, possibly lifelong passion, and it shows.<br /><br />I don't know where this movie's place in history will be.  But it was, indeed, a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

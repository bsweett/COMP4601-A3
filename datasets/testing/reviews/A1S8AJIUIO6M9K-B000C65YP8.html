<meta name="summary" content="Helpful in National Soul Searching and Confronting Reality"></head><body><p>Many of the reviews of this movie are unusually naive and stupid.<br /><br />My review of this movie is based on a lifetime overseas as the son of an oilman, as a Marine Corps infantry officer, as a clandestine case officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, and as the foremost trainer of governments interested in getting a grip on reality by focusing on open source of information in all languages.<br /><br />This is a first rate movie with some truly extraordinary visuals and some truly extraordinary lines.  It is an intelligence movie for intelligent people, and it should certainly give anyone both a couple of hours of enjoyment, and a couple of hours of reflection.<br /><br />Among the highlights:<br /><br />1)  AK-47 as the real weapon of mass destruction<br /><br />2)  Africans stripping a plane overnight, literally pulling every piece of it off and making it "disappear"<br /><br />3)  There is one gun for every 12 people, the arms dealers goal is to arm the other 11 as quickly as possible<br /><br />4)  The top arms dealers ("merchants of death") are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.<br /><br />I read more than I watch movies, and will end with two comments: a) all of my reading bears out the importance and relevance of this movie; and b) it is easily one of the more serious and appreciable movies I have seen in some time.  The intellect in the devising and presentation of this movie is absolutely first rate.</p></body></html>

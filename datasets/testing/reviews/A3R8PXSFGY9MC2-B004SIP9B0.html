<meta name="summary" content="The Queen"></head><body><p>This is a great film, looking inside the life of the royal family as they deal with the death of Diana. It shows how the country mourned her loss and how the royals found it hard to connect with the people they ruled. Tony Blair comes across as being in touch with the public mood and it is a good reminder of how he was when he started out and before the power corrupted! A few characters don't come across too well (Cherie Blair and Prince Phillip), but you tend to relate to the Queen by the end of the film and understand a little more how she was brought up in a different time and felt unable to connect with the country when they looked to her for a degree of leadership. All the parts are acted well and I found the film length to be perfect, with enough info and story before it became overlong and boring. Overall a good film, showing the more human side to the Queen and a snapshot of a turbulent time in the royals life. Worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

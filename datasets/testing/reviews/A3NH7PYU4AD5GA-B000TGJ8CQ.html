<meta name="summary" content="Good enough first draft, now please start making the real movie"></head><body><p>No movie based on a P.K.Dick story can be entirely without interest. The concept of looking two minutes into the future is a good basis for an interesting plot. This movie has quite a few good scenes exploring it. Best is of course the diner scene when Cage gets to know Biel.<br />The weakness of the movie is the lack of plot for the terror scenario. It is not enough to take a bunch of different young Europeans and some Asians and let them handle something which is said to be a nuclear device. Actually this part is like a simple copy of 'Die Hard IV', but without bothering to explain the who and why.<br />So let us send the producers of this movie back to the drawing board. With a good script writer, something could be made out of this story.</p></body></html>

Although inevitably some of these will be hugely anticipated and doubtless very good, there are always a few that will make its audience cringe.  This is one such movie.  The third in the `Austin Powers' trilogy finds Austin (Myers) teaming up with Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonc&eacute;) and father Nigel Powers (Caine) to defeat not only Dr. Evil but also Goldmember, both of whom wish to flood the world.  But to be fair it's not really the plot that's the problem, it's the fact that the same gags that were used in the first two films are here tired and devoid of any life.<p>In taking on four roles, it's a little bit of overkill for Myers, who should have stuck to playing Austin and Dr. Evil rather than taking on any other roles.  Whilst there was admittedly some fun to be had from the first movie, especially for those well acquainted with the James Bond franchise, the constant sexual innuendoes that are thrown out one after the other are increasingly dull.  Very few of the jokes stick, although there is a great line from Caine when he asks one unfortunate man `Do you know how many anonymous henchmen I've knocked out over the years'?  You'd think that with such a fantastic supporting cast - Michael Caine, Seth Green, Vern Troyer and Beyonc&eacute; are all brilliant - that there'd be something noteworthy in this movie, but it's actually incredibly boring.  True, it starts well with a host of cameo appearances - including Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears - that are very funny indeed, but it quickly goes downhill from there.  There's a fine line between affectionate parody and a desperate attempt at pandering to the audience's affection, and `Austin Powers' has crossed it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ignoring the English Dubbing...It's Actually Pretty Good"></head><body><p>"High Tension" is a French-horror film which Lions Gate decided to release after the success of such horror films as Saw. Problem is, like I said, "High Tension" is a French-horror film therefore some English dubbing is needed. I read some of the Amazon reviews before renting the movie and all of them said the English dubbing was bad. Well, when you're having actors speak a language over another one when the actors are moving their lips to the other language it's kind of hard to get it to look good. However, "High Tension" I thought didn't do to bad with the dubbing because first off; In the film the girls are made out to be bilinguial. Second; there isn't that much dialouge in the film, so it really doesn't matter. The film (I watched it twice. Once in English with subtitles for the french speaking parts. And once in French with english subtitles) is actually well done. It's a great horror film; Very bloody, gory, morbid, sick, and nasty. Pretty much everything one would want from a horror film. So, if you ignore the English dubbing; It's pretty f**king good.<br /><br />First of all, if you have a weak stomach (I don't and even I cringed at a few parts) don't watch this movie; If you don't like horrific horror films, don't watch this movie. In truth, my only complaint about the film was the ending.<br /><br />I think it was well played out actually even when the "twist" is revealed. Unlike most horror films where this same twist occurs; They don't bother playing it out anymore, this film still does...Hopefully if you've seen the film you know what I'm saying. Anyway, the film follows Marie (Cecile De France) and Alex (Maiwenn) who head out to Alex's parents secluded farm house to study for the weekend. As they head there, we see a guy in a rusty old truck getting a b***job from a woman; then he pulls the head up and throws it out the window. Morbid... Anyway, after Alex and Marie arrive they get settled in and in the dead of night; the Rusty truck pulls up and the man inside kills everyone in the house (except Marie who is actually pretty smart at hiding) and takes Alex hostage. Marie hops in the back of the truck with Alex and...Well, you're going to have to see it. (In English: B+; In French: A-)</p></body></html>

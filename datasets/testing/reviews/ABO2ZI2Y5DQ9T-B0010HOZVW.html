<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) "Death Wish" with Jodie Foster ... Sort Of: Great Acting, Not So Great a Story"></head><body><p>It's a revenge story set in New York City. It sounds like a female version of "Death Wish" at first sight, but things are more complicated as "The Brave One" stars Jodie Foster as Erica Bain, whose terrible experiences in the park turn her from a radio talk show host living happily into a one-woman vigilante squad. Among many A-list actresses that you can think of, Jodie Foster would be the most unlikely one to be seen in such a revenge story.<br /><br />But she is, and she is very good as you expect. The film gives Erica several occasions (pretty conveniently, I am afraid) to use her weapon, but the strength of "The Brave One" directed by Neil Jordan lies not only in suspense surrounding her "missions," but in how crimes (including Erica's) change her personality. Violence is depicted as it is, not glorified in any way and what she does is also often described as nasty and Jodie Foster is excellent showing her character's changes.<br /><br />So far the film is great. Neil Jordan also emphasizes the relations between Erica and the police detective (Terrence Howard), which is another merit. Unfortunately, however, reliable supports like Mary Steenburgen and Jane Adams (especially the latter) has virtually nothing to do.<br /><br />But I was disappointed with the final 20 minutes where the film becomes something different (though I cannot tell exactly how here). All I can say is that "Death Wish" is often accused of being a crowd pleaser, but "The Brave One" looks as if it wants to please us more. Very realistic depictions of crime and its victims are turned into a concluding sequence which is simply unbelievable in more than one way.<br /><br />Please see it for yourself if you want to know what I mean. I can assure you Jodie Foster gives strong acting yet again and I am sure that much of the film's power comes from her if not the script itself.</p></body></html>

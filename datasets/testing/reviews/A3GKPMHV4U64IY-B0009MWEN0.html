<meta name="summary" content="Military Intelligence?"></head><body><p>Although based on a classic science fiction novel, this is not really a science fiction film.  It is a war film.  Unfortunately the writers do not know war and combat.<br /><br />Humans are spreading through the galaxy.  Intelligent insects are also spreading through the galaxy.  Where the two meet there is usually bloodshed and slaughter.  Then actual war breaks out when the bugs send an attack against Earth.  The movie follows the careers of three young people who have signed up with the military right out of school.  The occupy positions in the infantry, fleet, and intelligence (although there seems to be little intelligence used).<br /><br />The movie is a little confused as it is part commercial and part film.  It is like the whole thing is a recruitment film (except for all of the death).  The military tactics are utterly stupid.  For instance, when you land on a planet of bugs that crawl, swarm, hop and fly, be sure to use open-air enclosures to ensure the lowest possible safety levels.  The bugs themselves are also contradictory.  Throughout most of the film we will see five or six soldier pour hundreds of rounds of automatic fire into a bug before it collapses.  Later, a single soldier starts picking off bugs with single shots (yeah, right).<br /><br />But still, in the end it is a fun film but you just can't think too much about the details (like the asteroid big enough to effect the gravity on a glass of water, but on nothing else in the ship).  For outright action this one is hard to beat and action films really aren't known for keeping details straight anyway, so enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg At His Absolute Best"></head><body><p>When future generations examine the Steven Spielberg canon, three motion pictures will stand out: "Schindler's List" (1993), "E.T." (1982) and "Jaws" (1975), the director's breakthrough thriller. More than 30 years later, the film remains a textbook example of storytelling and characterization - somehow managing to transcend Peter Benchley's source material. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss make a formidable ensemble while Spielberg keeps a tight grip on the watery suspense. No matter how many times you see it, "Jaws" still packs a powerful cinematic punch.</p></body></html>

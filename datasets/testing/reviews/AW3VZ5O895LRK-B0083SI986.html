<meta name="summary" content="What a Career--Clint Tops Himself with Gran Torino"></head><body><p>I remember Clint Eastwood from tv on RAWHIDE at the start of his career.  I remember him in a musical western PAINT YOUR WAGON in 1969.  I remember him in all of those westerns plus his first foray as DIRTY HARRY.  I remember his getting fired from the studio he worked for as a tv star, not for bad behavior but for lack of talent.  I was one of those same stupid people back then that thought this guy was just coasting on his good looks and as soon as those were gone his career would be kaput.<br /><br />Well his good looks are gone but he has so much talent that he is bigger than ever as both a director and actor.  Having seen the Oscar winner, Sean Penn in MILK, recently, I really think it should have gone to Eastwood instead.  Not that Penn doesn't do his usual first class job.  No, it is that Eastwood inhabits every nuance of a truly original fictional character which I tend to appreciate a lot more than biography.  Further, Eastwood hits America right where all the people in it live emotionally and economically in this moment of time whereas MILK looked back to a brief shining moment in gay rights history in San Francisco.<br /><br />Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old recent widower and Korean Korean War veteran.  He is a retired auto worker in Detroit who still lives in his old neighborhood much to his family's consternation.  His proudest possession is his completely restored 1972 Gran Torino automobile.  The attempted theft of this auto by the Asian youth who lives next door sets off a richly nuanced relationship between the two, which slowly ripens into a friendship.  They each have their separate problems too.  Walt is hitting the end of the road medically as he coughs up blood and discovers his serious prognosis.  The youth and his family are being terrorized by an Asian gang to which his cousin belongs.  They want him to join them and when he won't, they ratchet up the violence towards the entire family.  We know how Dirty Harry would solve the problems in this movie.  Walt is not Dirty Harry.  He lives in the real world and has to find real world solutions to the problems before him.<br /><br />Eastwood is just wonderful as this character.  The movie itself is a fine piece of writing which Eastwood himself superbly directs.  Such a fuss was made about his CHANGELING (which he directed with Jolie in the lead), which came out in the same year.  Now that I've seen both, this is the better movie. The Walt character is just everything you've got to love long range about America and what we are so close to losing.  It's true.  They don't make them like Walt anymore.<br /><br />Eastwood himself closes the movie by singing in his Walt voice a song about his Gran Torino over the closing credits. Here, truly, is the man who has done it all.</p></body></html>

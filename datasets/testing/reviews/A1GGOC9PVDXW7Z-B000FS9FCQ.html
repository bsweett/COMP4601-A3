<meta name="summary" content=""Remember, remember, the 5th of November...""></head><body><p>I just finished watching what could be considered the futuristic British equivalent of America's Independence Day. This may be the wrong take on the story but here's what I got from a first viewing.<br /><br />In V FOR VENDETTA (USA/UK/Germany-2005), a mysterious man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, black hat and cape plans to implode Westminster Palace as a way of getting out the truth to people being oppressed and controlled through a state-run TV network. At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.<br /><br />And to think I saw this movie totally by accident during the overnight after July 4th, not knowing at all what would happen.

<meta name="summary" content="Dracula Update"></head><body><p>This is a kind of original retelling of the Dracula legend with Hugh Jackman of X Men fame in the title role as Van Helsing. It is set in 1887 Transylvania. It was a decent effort. There was a lot of creature violence throughout the film.</p></body></html>

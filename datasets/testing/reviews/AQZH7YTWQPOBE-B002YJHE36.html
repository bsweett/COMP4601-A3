<meta name="summary" content="Stupid, convoluted plot"></head><body><p>I was shocked by the incredibly stupid and convoluted plot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4TE">Angels & Demons</a> - even worse than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOC9">The Da Vinci Code</a>. While I understand Dan Brown's stories are works of fiction, this just goes too far into the realm of unbelievability. It seems ass if one man was able to launch an entire conspiracy against the papal leadership, kill dozens of cops, and kidnap four cardinals with minimal help. Professor Robert Langdon, the protagonist, is able to draw connections between vague clues and never seems to get shot (even when the bad guy sees him, he refuses to shoot Langdon). Meanwhile, the whole bomb plot revolves around an antimatter device developed by Vatican scientists - technology far out of the reach of modern science, much less a few Vatican scientists. Even at the end, I couldn't figure out what was going on. There were so many loose ends that I was convinced the movie was made by a bunch of amateurs rather than a highly paid Hollywood scriptwriting team.<br /><br />As with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOC9">The Da Vinci Code</a>, the acting in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4TE">Angels & Demons</a> was pretty decent, particularly the supporting cast. Ewan McGregor stole quite a bit of the movie as a senior papal official. However, Tom Hanks as Professor Langdon was pretty forgettable as he was almost like a robot - always right, always the smartest guy in the room. Dr. Vitra was also almost a non-entity in the film rather than a co-star.<br /><br />I would warn anybody who is somewhat sensitive that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4TE">Angels & Demons</a> seems to delight in portraying gruesome deaths. In addition to your garden variety shootings, the film contains rats eating a dead man and several other set ablaze.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Start of New Zombie Series"></head><body><p>Land of the Dead is the first in a proposed new Zombie trilogy from the man who started it all, George Romero.  The very first thing that is evident in this film that is different than Romero's first three "dead" films is the budget.  The success of films like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake made this film bankable to Hollywood execs and certainly gave Romero far more to work with than he ever has before.  Better special effects, better make-up, superior acting.  Some are criticizing the film for a lack of a storyline but it's no different than any of the other dead films...it's human's against zombies.<br /><br />Land is sort of Dawn of the Dead remade and expanded.  Instead of a handful of humans being trapped in a mall, there are now thousands trapped in a city.  Only they don't think of themselves as trapped and life goes on as the city is protected by electified fences, walls, and rivers.  Social commentary has always been a big part of the Dead films and Land is no different.  The wealthy are still the "haves" and live in the prestigious Fiddler's Green Tower filled with luxury apartments, shopping, and hotels.  It's run by Kaufman played by Dennis Hopper.  If there is a story complaint it's that there's no backstory to the characters.  Just who is kaufman?  Why is he in charge of Fiddler's Green?  Is he a Donald Trump?  A former Mayor?  This is left without explanation.<br /><br />So even in this post-apocalyptic world overrun by Zombies, there is still a very tangible class system.  Those not wealthy or socially acceptable enough to live in the tower must make do on the streets.  Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo) are a couple of hired bandits for lack of a better word.  Rily has built a massive battleship on wheels called Dead Reckoning which they use to venture out of the city into the heart of zombie land to acquire food and other supplies.  Both men have their own plans of what they want to do with their lives.<br /><br />This sets up a bit of an out of place side story where Cholo steals DEad Reckoning and threatens to blow up the tower and Riley has to get the vehicle back.  Meanwhile...the zombies which began to start learning how to reason in Day of the Dead have advanced led by a black gas station attendant named Big Daddy who eventually leads the zombies to the city.  Someone commented that it was stupid for Kaufman to try and get out of the city with loads of money since the entire social and economic system has broken down.  But that's entirely the point of Romero's satire...even when money no longer matters, people still die or kill for it.<br /><br />This was a far more gruesome film than the Dawn Remake.  Heads explode, bodie parts are torn off, and guts are yanked out with regular frequency.  The makeup is vastly superior to the Dawn remake where the zomibies moved too fast to get a good look at them and the original Dawn where all the zombies looked powder blue.  And thank you George for not making your zombies run fast!<br /><br />Land continues to progress the story started in the original film as each successive film shows the zombies more and more in control of the world.  This is our first glimpse at the big picture and we wind out that the plague was world-wide in scope.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with excellent special features and the film had a cameo by Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright which is captured in one of the featurettes.  So maybe Land of the Dead wasn't the deepest story...it's a great Zombie film and who needs much more than that?</p></body></html>

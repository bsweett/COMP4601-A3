<meta name="summary" content="Can't wait for a sequel! But it doesn't mean that this movie was perfect!"></head><body><p>thanks to Frank Miller, Author of original Sin City Graphic novels who have directed this movie too, Ciertaily it's one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen. I'm not a cinema guy cause I can't watch a movie from beginning till the end without delay and I used to play back some scenes to watch them again and if I couldn't, It would sure made me rattle and nervous. but this movie is different. I just coudn't stop it even to use restroom! It was great, the only problem I noticed was the boold. In some scenes it was white, in some it was silver and in another some it was yellow and that made blood scenes less impressive. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, they should've shown the bood in black, not any other colors. and another problem of the movie was the Junior, at the end. they colored him and his stuff in yellow. that was inducing that the Junior is an alien not a human. but he was a maniac human and this movie was not star wars or star trek. we expected to see living dead & Unvulnarable Superhumans but not an alien like creature. and the third problem is not this movie's problem in particular! It's the next sequel's problem and the problem is, they'd gathered all suitable stars in this movie. Bruce willis, mickey rourke, Benecio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba and more but most of them died in the movie. so there is not much stars left for the sequel I hope they make it as soon as possible. Cast selection for this movie was extremely accurate and I'm afraid for the next sequel if they'll not do their job as good as this one. and at last it's not bad to mention that this movie was a big credit for Rodriguez after making some horrible movies like Spy Kids trilogy and I hope he continue to making movie with his original talent that we've previously seen in Desperado (1995).</p></body></html>

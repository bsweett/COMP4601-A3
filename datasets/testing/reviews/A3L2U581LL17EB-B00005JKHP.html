<meta name="summary" content="Lacks fun and emotion, but it's a spectacular epic saga."></head><body><p>The first of the popular sci-fi franchise, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is also the entry that I feel most divided on.  Here is a film that strives to be cerebral and thought-provoking, a movie made with the best of intentions, but in doing so, much of the appeal of Star Trek is lost.  Yes, the warm and witty &quot;human&quot; element is missing.  The characters that are here are certainly those of the crew of the starship enterprise, but change their names and they could simply be a different crew entirely.<p>The premise is interesting, and certainly less campy than one might reasonably have suspected back in 1979.  The film opens with three Klingon bird-of-preys that are attacked and engulfed by a giant alien cloud.  Concern about this heightens when the course trajectory for the anomaly shows it's heading for Earth.  Sent to prevent this possible global-scale destruction is Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who takes back the command of the starship Enterprise from Captain Will Decker (Stephen Collins, the guy from 7th Heaven, believe it or not).  <p>On the bridge of the ship include old crew members Sulu (George Takei), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Chekov (Walter Koenig), and good old Mr. Scott (James Doohan) down in engineering.  Brought out of retirement is Dr. Bones McCoy (DeForrest Kelley), against his will, too, but eventually grudgingly tags along.  With Spock (Leonard Nimoy) the last to arrive, the crew is reunited in their journey to the mysterious alien cloud, a hostile entity which appears to be alive.<p>What I've just described probably sounds like a great adventure, and make no doubt about it, several aspects of the film are terrific, even brilliant.  But overall, The Motion Picture is maddeningly inconsistent, often poorly placed, and sloppy in terms of plot execution.  In some ways, this doesn't even feel like the Star Trek many had come to know and love back in the late 60's.  TMP is sincere in its attempts to be a cerebral saga, so director Robert Wise makes certain to take the film as deadly serious as possible; there's not an ounce of good humor to be found here.<p>Given the premise, such a concept should be taken seriously, but not at the expense of the characters or the entertainment value.  TMP does sport its tense moments, particularly in the opening scenes and later when the Enterprise enters the cloud and the crew slowly makes some startling discoveries about the anomaly's origin.  The scene where an entity seemingly made of light invades the bridge and attacks the crew is even quite frightening, simply because Wise, well, wisely knows to keep us interested by venturing into the unknown. <p>But much of the portion set in the cloud is rather tedious.  Too much of it is spent looking at bizarre images as opposed to the crew speculating on the cloud's purpose and existence.  Does anyone remember that similar The Next Generation episode, where the crew finds themselves trapped inside this black anomaly and encounter a higher being called Nagilum?  Those 45 minutes were creepier and more entertaining than TMP.  That's not to say all the material involving the alien anomaly isn't involving.  The last half-hour finally gets to the speculation and theories we expect, so it makes for a thoroughly entertaining climax.<p>The cast is about what you'd expect if you're a fan of the series.  William Shatner's acting style is a sincere attempt at being serious, and no, it's not a particularly impressive performance, but he is the embodiment of Kirk.  Surprisingly, Shatner would go on to deliver impressive performances throughout the rest of the series.  Nimoy and Kelley are good as always.  But the main focus of the film appears to be with Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta.  They've got a weird pseudo-romance going on, or had at one point.  Neither performance is very good, but Khambatta still looks beautiful even with a bald head.  <p>So it seems my appreciation for The Motion Picture lies mostly in the visual and auditory sense.  The special effects, great for their time, are still eye-popping by today's standards, if not also slightly dated.  Arguably even more impressive is Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score, a memorable theme which outdoes even John Williams' work in Star Wars.  Both aspects deserved their Oscar nominations.<p>With this film, it often feels as if though the filmmakers were just desperate to introduce Star Trek to the series, and thus didn't quite put as much effort into this as they could have.  The potential for a character-oriented epic adventure was there, but Wise left out the characters, so what we're left with is a visually spectacular saga that didn't quite reach the mark it should have.  I still recommend The Motion Picture, but at least five of the sequels would turn out to be better (or at least more enjoyable) films (First Contact, The Undiscovered Country, The Voyage Home, The Wrath of Khan, and Generations).</p></body></html>

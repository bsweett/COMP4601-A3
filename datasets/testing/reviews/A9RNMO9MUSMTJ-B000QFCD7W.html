<meta name="summary" content="Fun movie"></head><body><p>Why pay for a movie that does'nt have a billion dollar budget and special effects...because movies like this are rare. Its a movie where the acting is more important than effects and we end up with a pretty good movie.<br />Nice to see a motorcycle gang like the old gang movies and Ray does a very<br />good job as their leader.  Entertaining...good for multiple viewing and<br />dont forget that there is more to the movie at the end's credits.<br />Enjoy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint's a winner!!"></head><body><p>I've have had this film in standard DVD, and now have the HD-DVD version of it, and it's even better.  I totally agree with the rave reviews of this film and it marked Eastwood as an important director to watch (witness his 2 great war films, and another Oscar winner-"Million Dollar Baby"). If you have either of the Hi-Def formats, I would seriously recommend you purchase this classic asap. By the way, when I first saw this classic in a suburban theatre, many people in the theatre clapped after it was over which goes to show you how strong a reaction this film has made on the general public!!  There are no winners when it comes to the violence within mankind!!</p></body></html>

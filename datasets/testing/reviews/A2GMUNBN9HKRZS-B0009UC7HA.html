Great locations, passable but not inspiring direction, likeable but watered-down characters, action is OK, not particularly thrilling. Thought this film would suck, got it on a whim at Megalo-Mart for $[...]. Light-weight, but still enjoyed it, will watch again someday. Good for a stay at home date when it's freezing outside and you want to curl up with your sweetie.</p></body></html>

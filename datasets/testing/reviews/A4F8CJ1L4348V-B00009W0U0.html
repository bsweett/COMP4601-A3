<meta name="summary" content="Great humorous horror flick"></head><body><p>This was a great movie that is humorous and scarey at the same time. It very scarey at times and very funny as well. It did borrow from many horror flicks and serial killers as well. When I was watching the movie, I was sitting there thinking what killer this is from. It is more scarey than the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" but is also similiar to it as well. Give it a try, for the price of a rental, what can you lose? I recommend this to anyone that likes B horror flicks that actually act like a big budget one.</p></body></html>

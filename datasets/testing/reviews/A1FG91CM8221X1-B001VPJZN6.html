<meta name="summary" content="Very good, but with this cast it should have been great."></head><body><p>"Red Dragon" has possibly the finest cast of any movie in the last decade: Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Mary-Louise Parker, and of course the incomparable Sir Anthony Hopkins, reprising his career-defining role as everybody's favorite psychopath, Hannibal Lecter. The cast acquits itself honorably, and the movie is very entertaining, yet it lacks either the pervasive foreboding of "The Silence of the Lambs" or the stylishness of "Manhunter," Michael Mann's original film version of Thomas Harris' novel of "Red Dragon." Brett Ratner is a good journeyman director; he paces the movie well, and gets a good share of thrills from the terrifying story. But he lacks the distinctive style of either Mann or Jonathan Demme. Compare how Ratner and Mann stage the ultimate fate of the sleazy tabloid reporter played by Stephen Lang in "Manhunter" and by Hoffman in "Red Dragon." The basic situation is horrific beyond belief, but Ratner's staging is pedestrian compared with Mann's, which rolls down the garage ramp into our nightmares. Among the "Red Dragon" cast, Fiennes and Watson make the most of their satisfyingly showy roles, but once again it is Hopkins, with his dead-fish stare and malevolent grin, who is the truly unforgettable and indispensable member of the cast.</p></body></html>

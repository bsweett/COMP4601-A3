<meta name="summary" content="This is just a review for the first film - Temple of Doom"></head><body><p>My boyfriend originally bought this about two years ago, for both of us to watch. We're still together, but it's taken him this amount of time to persuade me to watch it. It's become a running joke, including one of his lovely (male) colleagues nearly inviting himself round to watch this and have a few beers. Hopefully now it will stop - and I'll watch the rest. Yes, I did actually enjoy it that much. OK, I'm only rating it 3 stars, but I've only seen the first movie (which is actually the second movie, but chronologically the first - try getting your head around THAT!), and will hopefully see the sequel & the prequel at a later date, and add to this review.<br /><br />I've often heard this (or these) movies compared mostly to the Lara Croft & The Mummy movies. OK, I can see a slight similarity, since they're supposedly both about archeology, but I didn't really see that much about it in this! I did see a similarity that my boyfriend pointed out to Young Sherlock Holmes. Harrison is now more known for his relationship with that Ally McBeal girl, and there's been rumours about a fourth movie for ages. I'd have to see the other movies first before I comment on a possible fourth, but I think he's slightly on the wrong side of 50 to do these now. We'll see.<br /><br />When this film opened with a severely corny song & dance routine (coming from a girl who loves Grease & Sound Of Music, that's saying something!) I decided giving in to my boyfriend just this once was a bad idea. Thankfully it picked up, although I did find the film slightly slow at points. Kate Capshaw was OK I guess, although I read that she had to be taught how to be scream. How do you get 'taught' how to scream? I thought it would be natural instinct! I loved little Jonathan Ke Quan, as Short Round. This kid was absolutely adorable, although you had to listen really closely to what he said, but whatever he was saying had me smiling! He hasn't done that much since this, apart from The Goonies, and seems to be working behind the camera much more now. Look up some recent photos of him though - what a cutie!<br /><br />I think Harrison does have a pretty fair chance of returning to playing Indy, as he's more affectionately known. He hasn't changed that much from then & now. OK his hair's gone white, but obviously, if there is going to be a fourth, it's going to be brought very up to date.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised at how little this film has dated, considering it's the same age as me. OK there was a couple of dodgy scenes, particularly the scene where they snowboard in a dinghy, but that was all I noticed really.<br /><br />I will be very interested to see the rest of the movies, and hopefully give my boyfriend a chance to review a DVD he's had for two years. I'll add to this review the more I see. Can't wait!!!</p></body></html>

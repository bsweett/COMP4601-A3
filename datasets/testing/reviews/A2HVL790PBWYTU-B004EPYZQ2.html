And, it turns out, what SUPER 8 is, is a blast from the past, a nostalgic kick of cinema. And it's good, it's really good. There's a kid in this film who, whenever he thought something was cool, would remark, "That was mint!" Well, sir, SUPER 8 was mint.<br /><br />SUPER 8 is set in 1979, in the heartland town of Lillian, Ohio. Four months after the death of his mother at the local steel factory, 12-year-old Joe Lamb and his dad are grieving still, Joe's dad, a Sheriff's Deputy, still so affected that he's become estranged from his son. Joe at least has got his friends to distract him. It's summer now, school in the rearview for a while, and Joe's promised to help out his good chubby buddy (and budding filmmaker) Charles with his 8mm zombie movie, hopefully to be finished in time for an upcoming film festival. Joe builds train models, but he's also handy with monster make-up.<br /><br />Joe is particularly stoked to learn that his dream girl, Alice, will be acting in the picture. Joe and his friends (and Alice) all agree to sneak out at night and shoot scenes at the local train station. But then their little horror film gets upstaged when a military train rumbles by and derails spectacularly. And that's the start of a series of mysterious and frightening events befalling the town of Lillian.<br /><br />Joe Lamb, observant and early on tapped as the prospective protagonist, notes that something has punched thru the steel confines of one of the box cars. Soon after, the town suffers persistent fluctuations in electrical power, dogs are running away, and people are vanishing, as well as automobile parts and various everyday household items. And the U.S. Air Force has come to town, behaving oddly and sweeping the town streets and fiddling with their instruments. In the air wafts the smell of  a military cover-up.<br /><br />In a nod to the paranoid 1950s sci-fi flicks, certain of the townspeople blame the Red Menace. Joe and his friends know better. They've seen stuff, including these weird little cubes. But they were warned, warned by the only other person to have witnessed the train crash (and he actually caused it). If the kids talk, "they" will get them... and their parents, too. Except that this is the kind of movie in which the adults are the ones milling around, perplexed, and kids are the only ones who can save the day. I'm all for this kind of movie.<br /><br />This is intentionally a throwback film. And it throws me back to that era, when disco was at its last gasp. When the Walkman was the latest revolutionary leap in music accessibility. When sexy Debbie Harry was doing her thing. When the Three Mile Island disaster was still topical.  When folks said things like "gnarly." SUPER 8 will resonate with just about everyone, but even more strongly with those falling in the Generation X bracket. Writer/Director J.J. Abrams has learned well at the master's feet. Much of what's in SUPER 8 evokes classic Spielberg. This story is darker and with a harder, more brutal edge, but somewhere in it you can catch glimpses of E.T. and THE GOONIES. Only, the special effects are much more lavish. Even if Abrams teases you for much of the film by only revealing shadowy bits of the terrifying alien set loose in the tiny town.<br /><br />Abrams constructs a good mystery, and he's excellent with staging the reveals. All of that doesn't impress me as much as how he handles the story's human elements, or, more specifically, how good he is with those scenes showcasing the children. He treats these scenes - which are all a homage to adolescence - with clear affection and humor and perceptiveness. More, he obviously feels a kinship to these kid characters who, just like him at that age, are avid film buffs and amateur filmmakers. Somewhere, in a producer's chair, polishing his Oscars, Spielberg must've been beaming, just beaming. It helps that the two child leads, Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are so terrific. They hit those emotional beats just perfect. I also got love for that firecracker-obsessed pal of theirs who is certainly destined to be a future arsonist. What's less excellent - partly because it's resolved in such a perfunctory manner - is how Joe and his dad's strained relationship is developed. Also, Joe's dad (Kyle Chandler) seems slated to have a bigger role to play in the story. But, it turns out, not so much. And, if you're anticipating a full-on E.T.-type interaction between the kids and the alien, prepare to be thwarted. For the most part, this alien is nothing like E.T. ***SPOILER FOR THIS NEXT SENTENCE ONLY*** SUPER 8 shows what well may have happened to E.T. if the military had gotten its hands on him before Eliott did. SUPER 8 is watchable because the premise hooks you in and Abrams knows storytelling. But, for my money, it elevates to must-see status because these kid actors are so good at their craft and because Abrams does well with evoking a child's natural sense of wonder. It's all mint, baby.<br /><br />And mind that you stay for Charles's completed zombie film (titled "The Case") which plays during the closing credits.</p></body></html>

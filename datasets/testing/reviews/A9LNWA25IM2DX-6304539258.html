<meta name="summary" content="My last Star Wars Trilogy"></head><body><p>I will not get into many details as a lot of people has reviewed this item. One of the most viewed reviews (by Kory) explains the difference between regular widescreen and anamorphic widescreen and how annoying is to watch the 1977 film with black bars surrounding the whole picture (top, bottom, left and right).<br /><br />Could Lucasfilm have released something better than this? Definitely. This limited edition of the star wars trilogy is the same from 2004, the difference now is that one of the "bonus materials" (what is that supposed to mean?) is the original release, no digital Jabba, Han shooting first, Ewoks singing at the end of `Jedi' and the original phantom of Anakin Skywalker. It took only 2 years for this release after Lucas stated he would not be releasing the original versions. Now he releases this and says he will not remaster them, which can only mean we have to wait another couple years to have the original versions remastered.<br /><br />I agree with those that believe Lucas disrespected his original films, for a company that is the one to set the quality standard in movie releases (ILM and THX) this is a poorly done job, Dolby 2.0 surround, not remastered and non anamorphic! They did a superb job remastering the special editions, try watching the special edition and then compare it to this DVD release, the difference is abysmal, I tried to watch this in my widescreen TV and had to use the zoom feature as it is not enhanced for anamorphic widescreen which only made the quality of the image look worse.<br /><br />Why did I purchase these then? Well, I, like many fans, still kept VHS copies of the original trilogy before the special edition, the VHS image was not anamorphic, not remastered and the format is almost extinct. I see this release as a digital version of those VHS films, I believe this DVD will last longer than my old VHS copies and plus, I got them at the price of $9.99 each (and can be found cheaper) I can finally get rid of the old VHS and keep these digital versions of the original films.<br /><br />It is rumored that a complete collection is to be released later this year commemorating the 30th anniversary, it will probably have the original editions remastered, however, I do not intend to purchase that, enough is enough, I had always waited to see a DVD release of the original trilogy, well, it may not be the best but it is finally here. Over the years I've learned that Lucas will always have `never before seen' additional material to include in every single new release he plans. I have the special edition (remastered as it is) and these limited original versions copied from the laser disc release.<br /><br />I decided to buy it and stop complaining, finally, this is the last Star Wars trilogy I am buying!</p></body></html>

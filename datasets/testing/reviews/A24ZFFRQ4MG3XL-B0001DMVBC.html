I thought the actual storyline was only average, but it was the acting (especially from Ben Kingsley who I normally don't like) that made this movie.  You actually felt very sorry for Ben's character because through no real fault of his own, he suffered great losses with a tragic outcome.  Ron Eldard looked hot in it and was fairly good too.  Jennifer Connelly was a little whiney but overall, this is a good movie and I could understand how some actors were nominated for Oscars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious!"></head><body><p>This film was my introduction to Monty Python.  When I was a boy, the local PBS station aired it frequently.  I was hooked instantly and began watching the television series as well.  The Pythons pioneered a delightfully absurd brand of comedy that has been imitated but never equaled.  I actually enjoy some of their later films more (particularly &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;), but this skewering of the Arthurian legend remains one of my all-time favorite comedies.</p></body></html>

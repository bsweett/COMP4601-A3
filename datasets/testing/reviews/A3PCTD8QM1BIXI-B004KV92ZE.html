<meta name="summary" content="One Of my favorite animated movies this year"></head><body><p>Not since The Simpson's Movie, have I enjoyed an animated movie as much as Kung Fu Panda. Jack Black was the perfect choice to voice PO a loveable Panda who longs to be a Kung Fu Panda. The rest of the voice cast including Ian McShane as the bad guy and Dustin Hoffman as the wise sensei are both in top form. The film plays it smart by having the most dialogue come from Black and Hoffman as it's their movie and for a PG rated film the action sequences were quite impressive. All in all a great film that I can't wait to own on DVD and watch with my own son bring on the sequel!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Gory but Good"></head><body><p>The world is taken over by zombies but a greedy rich man has a secure building that he pays soldiers to protect while his rich friend and he live the good life. When one of the soldiers asks to move into the building and is turned down he steals an armed truck that is a powerful weapon and threats to blow up the building unless the greedy rich guy gives him five million dollars. Meanwhile, the zombies are getting smarter and threaten to take over the protected city. The basic subplot is the inherit evil in class systems and looking down on others because you think you are better.<br /><br />Good zombie flick but you better not be grossed out by gore if you want to watch it. I liked it.</p></body></html>

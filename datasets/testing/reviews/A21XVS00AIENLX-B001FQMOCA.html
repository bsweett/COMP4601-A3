Johnny Cash had a broodier personality than I realized, but it was because he felt incomplete without June Carter.<br /><br />Much like Ray Charles, Cash was also traumatized by the death of a brother.  However, there the similarities end. In "Ray", it was revealed that Ray Charles loved music above all else, including his own family and the many, many women.  For Cash, his heart's desire was for one woman only: June Carter...an obsession that drove him to drug addiction.  I liked this approach to the film versus focusing on Cash's rise to fame.  This flaw makes him seem more human and less iconic.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is hot in this film and did a wonderful job; Reese certainly deserved this Oscar...her best role to date. Forget Vanity Fair.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Entertaining, but Diluted by a Crowded Plot and Visual Mediocrity."></head><body><p>"Spider-Man 3" precariously balances an excess of plot elements that never come together quite cohesively but nonetheless produce a reasonably entertaining action movie. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is basking is Spiderman's glory and plans to propose marriage to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who continues to struggle with her stage career. Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church), a small-time crook believed to have murdered Parker's dear Uncle Ben, has been transformed into the Sandman by an opportune accident with a particle accelerator. Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to avenge his father by becoming the Green Goblin reincarnate. A self-absorbed upstart named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after Parker's job at the Daily Bugle. If that weren't enough trouble, an insidious symbiotic organism is bringing out the worst in Spider-Man.<br /><br />That's only half of it. This plot is crowded. Ultimately, "Spider-Man 3" continues to explore Peter Parker's struggle with his own psyche in the form of conflicting emotions and desires. But this isn't as effective as the previous two films. The overloaded narrative seems scattershot. I don't think Tobey Maguire's performance is as strong as it has been in the past, but Topher Grace contributes a nice edge as the amoral narcissist Brock, who later becomes Venom, a villain who shares many powers with Spider-Man. My reaction to Sandman is lukewarm, but I love what they did with Venom. It's disappointing that this third installment isn't as visually smart as its predecessors. Dramatic, thoughtful composition is what placed the Spider-Man films a cut above most superhero movies. Still entertaining, but most of "Spider-Man 3" is nothing special.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia 2007 single disc): Bonus features include Bloopers (6 min), a music video for "Signal Fire" (4 min), Galleries of Sketches, Paintings, Special Effects, Director & Cast, video game and toy previews (2 min), and 2 audio commentaries. The 1st commentary is with director Sam Raimi and actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Thomas Hayden Church, James Franco, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard. This is conversational but informative, a mix of the actor's experiences and observations with discussion of the collaborative aspect of the film, characters, visual effects, and more. The 2nd audio commentary is with producers Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, Grant Curtis, visual effects supervisor Scott Stokdyk, and editor Bob Murawski. They talk about shooting the effects sequences, scenes from concept to realization, casting, evolution of the story, and technical stuff.</p></body></html>

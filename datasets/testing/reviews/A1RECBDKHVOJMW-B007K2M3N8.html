Mr. Spacey, an obvious fan of Mr. Darin's, not only co-wrote the screenplay with Lewis Colick, he produced, directed and stars in this longtime project. The job he does is a worthy one, and I vigorously applaud him for his achievement. It is clear that his efforts to bring the life of the versatile performer and vocalist to the big screen are indeed a labor of love. Spacey's background research is extraordinary. Apparently, he was given the full cooperation of Bobby Darin's estate, getting permission to do the covers for Darin's songs, which Spacey also sings. I have to say, as a major admirer of Kevin Spacey, ("The Life of David Gale," American Beauty," "Pay It Forward," "The Usual Suspects," etc.), that I never realized he could sing and dance...and do the job well!<br /><br />Spacey physically resembles Darin in the film. He has the performing style down pat, and plays a remarkably credible nightclub entertainer too. Most importantly, Bobby Darin, pop artist as well as the man he was off-stage, are indeed brought to life in "Beyond The Sea." Are there flaws? Absolutely! However, Darin's talent, drive, energy and ambition are evident through Kevin Spacey's fabulous, energetic portrayal.<br /><br />Born Walden Robert Cassotto, in 1936, to a poor, working-class family in the Bronx, NY, Bobby was a frail child. He contracted rheumatic fever at age eight, and the disease left him with a seriously diseased heart. The doctor predicted he would die by the time he reached sixteen, and although he obviously did not, he lived with the constant knowledge that his life might end at any moment. Driven by poverty and continuing poor health, he possessed an innate talent for music. Encourage by his mother Polly, (Brenda Blethyn), a veteran vaudeville performer, he could play several musical instruments by the time he was a teen, and belt out a song with the best of them. His ambition was to be better than Sinatra and to play the Copacabana nightclub. He certainly did play at the Copa, many times, to sell-out crowds. As far as being better than Sinatra....well no, not to me. But does it matter? He was terrific as Bobby Darin!<br /><br />Rock and roll was at its prime in the late 1950's when Darin released a song he wrote himself, "Splish-Splash." It became an instant hit, selling more than one million records. Shortly afterward his ballad "Dream Lover," topped the charts - one of my own favorites. And than came his jazz-pop interpretation of "Mack the Knife," from Kurt Weil's "Three Penny Opera." Darin's music career soared, and he was offered movie roles - not as a vocalist, but as a serious actor, and met his wife, Sandra Dee while filming "Come September." He was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role in "Captain Newman, M.D." with Gregory Peck, Tony Curtis and Angie Dickinson.<br /><br />The film begins as a movie within a movie. Darin appears onstage. It looks like he is directing an autobiographical motion picture. He begins to sing "Mack The Knife." Then he calls "Cut," and discusses with the child who plays him as a young boy, (a super performance by William Ullrich), how the story would best be told from a cinematic perspective. Darin follows the boys advice. There is a drum roll - and the audience is taken back to the Bronx, where it all began. The opening montages, with the musical song and dance numbers on New York City streets, are wonderful, and campy. Throughout, there are flashbacks, with the older Darin making comments on his life in present time. The issue of Spacey's age is addressed up front, and for me age was no issue at all. Spacey is Darin, at any and all ages. Darin's admiring brother-in-law, Charlie (Bob Hoskins) asks, "How can you be too old to play yourself?"<br /><br />The supporting cast is very good, but the focus is on Darin 90 percent of the time. Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee, Bobby's teen bride and Hollywood star, does an excellent job of portraying the sheltered, naive actress, who panics on her wedding night. Her decline from successful ingenue, to disappointed, alcoholic has-been by age twenty-six is quite moving. John Goodman as Darin's best friend and manager, Steve Blauner, is good, as is Greta Scacchi as Sandra Dee's overbearing mother - but their parts are minimal. Darin's much older sister, Nina (Caroline Aaron), overacts, at times grotesquely, and this is a shame, as her connection with her brother is an extremely important one. However, her husband, Charlie Maffia, (Hoskins), brings tremendous warmth to the production.<br /><br />Darin is not whitewashed here. We are shown his demons as well as all the good stuff. I was a Darin fan, but not as big a one as Kevin Spacey. However, after watching the film, I began to think about the performer and admire him more. He died at such a young age, 37, that he had little time to make his mark upon the world. Yet, he certainly did so. I say Bravo to all those involved in making the movie. You bring Bobby's name and achievements to the fore 32 years after his death. Sandra Dee also died young, in February, 2005. Both Bobby and Sandra are survived by their son, Dodd, his wife and two children.<br /><br />"Memories are like moonbeams, we do with them what we want," says Bobby Darin in "Beyond the Sea." I haven't thought of him in years, but thanks to Kevin Spacey I am thinking about him now - and even listening to one of his CDs as I type.<br />JANA</p></body></html>

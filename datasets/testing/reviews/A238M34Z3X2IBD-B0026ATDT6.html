<meta name="summary" content="ONLY HAPPY WHEN IT RAINS"></head><body><p>THE HOST has one thing going for it, an agile, almost logical, monster... and that's it.<br /><br />When it's on screen, when it's moving, when it's putting the bite on people or snatching the same people up and storing them in its own version of a CRISPER drawer, there is a lot to admire in this import.  The monster's first full on screen appearence is a marvel to behold, not only because it takes place during daylight hours (very rare for these types of films), not only because it takes place within a large crowd of people, but everyone and everything involved moves in a logical fashion.  From the frist sighting to final snatch and splash, it all looks like something that could very well happen.  Wonderfully done.<br /><br />As for the rest... get a pen, get a pad of paper and be prepared to take notes because little next to nothing makes any kind of sense.  The central players in THE HOST is a family seemingly put together from a series of other unproduced films.  There's the father who looks like a grandfather, two sons - one, a pudgy, bulky, slow witted father himself, the other a miracle of the Korean education and political system.  He's a lawyer in training, a corporate raider, a student, a eco/bio protester who's sister just happens to be a Olympic level athelete in the field of archery (taking the Bronze at the beginning of the film).  It's almost like a skewed version of the FANTASTIC FOUR, everyone seems to have some kind odd "gift" that sets them apart from the rest.<br /><br />There is also the daughter of the pudgy, bulky slow witted father who seemes to have gotten all her looks and good sense from her mother - which, for a film like this is a good thing.  It's her smarts that help her to survive and a mother's strength that allows her to make the ultimate sacrifice.  There's an unhappy ending here in THE HOST, but you'll have a hard time either understanding it, or feeling bad about it, because the rest of the film is mired in protest... against the government, against corporations, against posions, against any and everything it can lay its hands on.<br /><br />THE HOST is one busy film.  Actually, it's more like six films running at once and that's its main flaw, it doesn't know what it wants to say and instead of putting its focus squarely on a family in peril and a monster on the loose, it tries too hard to sum up Korea's political, social and corporate strife.  It's just too much of everything... and because of that THE HOST will go down as a missed oppurtunity to redefine the genre.  But, for the short time the monster is the star of the picture, it works... but not enough to earn a place on your shelf.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WITLESS, DERIVATIVE AND GRIM"></head><body><p>Not for a moment did I suspend disbelief at this meaningless spectacle of mayhem and contrived superficial emotion interspersed with loud, over-the-top action set pieces.<br /><br />By paying to see this movie, I felt guilty supporting an increasingly bizarre and crazy man's delusional, controlling behaviour. Yes, I'm talking about Tom Cruise. I heard other movie goers expressing the same thoughts.  So I'm not alone.<br /><br />My gut feeling is that some of the Amazon reviewers who praised this movie are Paramount plants.  Even my 12 year old son thought the movie was "boring" and he laughed when he heard the familiar notes of the Mission Impossible theme.  He said he couldn't "take it seriously and the plot was ridiculous."  So if this wasn't made for 12 year old boys, who was it made for?  Not young adults, that's for sure.</p></body></html>

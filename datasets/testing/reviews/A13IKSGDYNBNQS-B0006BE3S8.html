However to write it off completely is unfair as it has some merit. I thought the basic plot idea was a rather well thought out story, and for the first hour the film maintained a decent level of interest and even a little bit of characterisation.<br /><br />It was certainly nice to Lance Henriksen back playing Charles Bishop Weyland - a nod to Bishop the android in Aliens. Sanaa Lathan is also pretty good as Alexa (effectively the Ripley role) but you would have thought that they could have come up with something slightly more original than creating another Ripley like character. It did become a bit predictable in the second half of the film and there are some noteable plot holes that can't be explained away.<br /><br />Overall though I found to be an entertaining film. It may be shallow but there are a lot worse films than this out there.</p></body></html>

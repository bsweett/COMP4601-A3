Carried by animals and humans, the virus is impossible to contain, and spreads across the entire planet. Twenty-eight days later, a small group of survivors are trapped in London, caught in a desperate struggle to protect themselves from the infected. As they attempt to salvage a future from the apocalypse, they find that their most deadly enemy is not the virus, but other survivors.  <p>The film starts brilliantly with a brief prologue in which animal rights activists break into a top secret laboratory to set free the animals held there. Unfortunately, they decide to release a chimpanzee that carries a deadly new virus called Rage. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma in hospital to find the city of London apparently deserted - little does he know that the homicidal victims of Rage are at large across the country. This British variation on the post-apocalyptic zombie movie was scripted by Alex Garland, whose book The Beach had previously been filmed by director Danny Boyle. But where zombies in other movies are slow and crave the taste of human flesh, the red-eyed zombies here sprint around at high speed and are satisfied with merely killing or spreading the virus through bloody vomit. We are told that Britain has been evacuated, so only a few survivors remain to share the country with what's left of the infected population. The streets we see are deserted (there's a nice sequence at the start with Jim wandering alone through the city) and only occasionally will bands of marauding zombies emerge to pick off the uninfected, which makes you wonder where they go to for the rest of the time - the attacks aren't quite relentless enough in their frequency.<br /><br />The vision of a devastated society is convincingly portrayed, with plenty of pop culture references and brand names to show what has been left behind. There is also nostalgia for lost families; in fact, the people Jim joins up with become surrogate families for him, whether it's with Brendan Gleeson's decent taxi driver and his daughter, or the rather more dysfunctional troop of soldiers headed by Christopher Ecclestone. The soldiers make it clear that now the culture is in ruins the violence inherent in everyone has broken through to the surface, infected or not. <p>The film carries a few twists to the plot which will keep you interested through-out. The film is well-acted, particularly by Murphy (Disco Pigs), who has a spaced-out quality as an actor that really adds to his role. It`s also filmed on digital video, giving the film a gritty, more realistic feel and distinguishing it from glossy Hollywood horrors such as Scream etc.<p>This is an excellent film that presents a unique view of London and breathes new life into the zombie genre. In addition, the shocks work brilliantly and there are some truly terrifying moments. Which, let`s face it, is all you really need from a zombie flick. Impressive, atmospheric and very scary, this is an extremely effective British horror movie. Worth going to see. This blows any horror film released this year away. It is te film "Stephen King's The Stand" should have been. Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

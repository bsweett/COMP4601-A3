I cannot think of any actress better for this part, she owns this movie and is frankly the main reason to see it.  The book was  a fun, quick read, and the movie is fun, but the story light and meandering, like the book..Hathaway does not get in the way and she's good in the role, the movies cameo's are good as well, but again its Streep, that makes this movie.</p></body></html>

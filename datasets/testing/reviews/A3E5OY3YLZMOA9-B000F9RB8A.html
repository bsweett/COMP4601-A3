The story begins with a rather serious scene when the entire Crocodile gang is taken out by the dancing, powerful, and notorious Axe Gang. After getting to know their power you are then introduced to the stupidity of Sing and his sidekick.<br /><br />The two want to be members of the Axe Gang but they can't fight and they are too wimpy to pull off any crimes. Sing tries to fool a barber in Pig Sty alley, which is a district that had no trouble because of poverty. Sing starts something he can't finish when he sends a fake distress call used by gangs when in the need of help. The Axe gang isn't pleased when they find a district of broke people picking on two fake members of their gang but somehow they didn't notice they had nothing to do with their gang.<br /><br />Not only does Sing get the district in trouble he unknowingly gets the Axe Gang in trouble. There are heroes within the district but you would never think these guys  were anyones hero, one is a tailor, the other a cook, and the last is just a hard labor worker. None of them look like heroes but they are and man can they fight. I know Kung Fu Hustle is supposed to be funny but to me it was just a perfectly blended masterpiece. The fight sequences were amazing and like nothing you've ever seen before and the story is gripping. There's one scene where these two assassins use sound waves as a weapon so maybe that helps to show how unique this is.<br /><br />My only problem was some things were a little too fake or digitalized and this made some of the fights not as good as others. I recommend watching this film in subtitles and not in the English dialogue. Seeing it in English just takes away from the film because you miss most of what is really being said. The music is great because it adds extra edge and suspense to the film.</p></body></html>

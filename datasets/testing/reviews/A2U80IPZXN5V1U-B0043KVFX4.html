<meta name="summary" content=""The End Of The World?""></head><body><p>Resident Evil was originally a video game that enjoyed much succes and it made the jump from video games to movies with "Resident Evil" in 2002 to mixed reviews.Nothing left hope for a second film.A sequel followed "Apocalypse" in 2004 wich left quite a few disapointed and wondering.Forward to 2007 when the third Resident Evil movie is released,"Extinction".Lets just say that "Extinction" is not anything fabulous but is still enjoyable and very entertaining,it's not a movie that you HAVE to buy,still it has its share of action,zombies and twists.If you have ever generated any interrest in either the video games or any of the two first movies then you probably should watch "Extinction".It has its flaws but it does manage to keep your interest and if you don't expect too much of it then you will like it more and if you set your expectations too high then this will seem mediocre to you.Actress Milla Jovovich who plays main character of Alice returns delivering possibly her best performance of the Resident Evil movies,at least that's something good.<br /><br />Here's a little resume of what happened in the first two movies.In the first Resident Evil the Umbrella Corporation develops a T-Virus intended to be a biological weapon,turns out that millions of people are turned into zombies.Alice wakes up confused and tries to form a team to search for the survivors.They also search for any information ainvailable on the T-Virus.Now,in the second Resident Evil Alice wakes up in a lab,most specificly the lab of the Umbrella Corporation.The corporation builds a wall around the town so that no one can leave.The virus is making its way to Racoon City.Alice and a qualified team for the job try to find a girl and a way to save the town.All three movies have something in common,Alice wakes up in each naked or mostly,now you judge if its good or bad,i won't!<br /><br />In Extinction things have gotten far worst.The entire world is now affected by the T-Virus and now even the water and soil are affected,forming a mostly deserted planet rich in one thing only : zombies!It has affected even Alice,but in a good way.This film has a few returning characters from Apocalypse and they team with Alice to take on the zombies.Meanwhile scientist Dr.Issacs of the Umbrella Corporation finds a cure for the T-Virus.Of course it is tested on an actual zombie and the results were that the zombie now had memories.When Alice speaks with Issacs he tells her that the cure might just be her blood.It ends with thousands of once again naked Alice,but this time clones.This leaves you wondering what has just happened and you realize that this wasn;t much of a movie it was a sub-movie to prepare us for the inavitable fourth Resident Evil movie.Of course there is lots of blood,zombies gets killed and a few characters won't be alive by the end of the film but it was to be expected.<br /><br />The biggest disapointment with Extinction is that it doesn't go anywhere except that it is setting things up for a fourth film.I expected better and I will admit that I was disapointed as many were but it was still watchable and it did entertain me for the film's length.You don't have to be a fan to watch this,neither do you have to have played the video games.It isn't anything great be advised and it is worth a rental in my book,only if you are interrested.There are good features with the "making of" featurettes and the commentaries but nothing really special worth mentionning.I rank it three but its pretty close to two and a half stars.</p></body></html>

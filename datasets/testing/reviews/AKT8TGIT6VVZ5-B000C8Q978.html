<meta name="summary" content="An odd film about a male cipher, Bill Murray's character"></head><body><p>I know that art house film goers and critics have praised with ample enthusiasm the work of Jim Jarmusch. However, judging from "Broken Flowers", the praise seems a bit overrated, unless it's mainly for the existentialist themes of his films, fine acting and cinematography. Bill Murray's Don Johnston, the main protagonist, is quite literally a male cipher, whom we, the audience, should have little empathy for. Having just broken up with his latest girlfriend (Julie Delpy, in yet another terrific role as a cynical, head-strong  young American), Johnston receives an anonymous letter from a long-lost flame, announcing that he has a 19 year-old son who is out somewhere looking for him. Aided and abetted by his computer geek friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Johnston travels across the United States on airplanes and rental cars, chasing down four of his long-lost loves, portrayed by Sharon Stone (as an over eager former cheerleader who realizes how much she misses Don), Frances Conroy (a successful real estate businesswoman with whom Don has a rather surreal dinner with her and her husband, Christopher McDonald; the latter gives a spellbinding performance as the husband), Jessica Lange (as an affluent "animal communicator" who may have a serious relationship with her young receptionist, portrayed by Chloe Sevigny),  and Tilda Swinton (as a poor white-trash Southern woman who reacts belligerently to Don's unexpected visit). The film is replete with many funny and sad moments about human relationships, so for these reasons alone it is worth seeing. However, those who may find maddening the slow pace and existentialist quality of Jarmusch's film should think twice before viewing it.</p></body></html>

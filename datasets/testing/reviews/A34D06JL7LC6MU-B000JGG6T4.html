There's few things wrong with this movie. The cinematography is great, the use of subtitles is great, Scott's directing and Denzel Washington/Dakota Fanning are in top form. The movie "Man on Fire" is about John Creasy (Washington). Creasy, an alcoholic ex-CIA operative, is given a job opportunity by his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken). He is hired by<br /><br />Samuel (Marc Anthony) and Lisa Ramos (Radha Mitchell) to be a bodyguard for their young daughter Pita (Fanning). Creasy thinks of it as merely a job, but eventually Pita gets to him and changes him. Then she's kidnapped and Creasy goes looking for her killer. Some critics liked the film, some did not. One critic said that he didn't like it because of the violence Creasy uses to find information about her kidnapper. The violence isn't overly graphic nor is it not graphic enough. It's pretty much right on par.<br /><br />This film is great; A</p></body></html>

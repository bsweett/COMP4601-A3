Giant Robots are the cat's pyjamas, any day of the week. And you'll find them in spades, and in all shapes and sizes, in the brilliantly retro "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow", among other joys, dark and light.<br /><br />Lightest of all is the artistry with which first-time director Kerry Conran (happily tinkering away on "John Carter of Mars") and effects/cinematography chief Eric Adkins and Mike Navarro have crafted this visual feast, which is so seamless, and harkens back so powerfully and nostalgically to the 1930's Golden Age of Cinema, that "Sky Captain" demands nothing less than to be seen in a gilded movie palace.<br /><br />If that can't be arranged, you're still in for a treat. You've got plummy Gwyneth Paltrow playing the plummier Polly Perkins, saving that single exposure for the shot of the century while evading Giant Killer Robots on Park Avenue.<br /><br />You've got the mostly bland but spit-and-polish swashbuckling of Jude Law (Sky Captain himself), dogfighting with Deadly Giant Flying Robots in his P-51 and keeping that scarf flying back over his shoulder.<br /><br />You've got Angelina Jolie as the airborne black widow spider of the piece (and femme fatale, natch) Captain "Franky" Cook. Piloting the huge, lumbering sky carriers and well-armed attack submersibles, kitted out in a form-fitting black uniform complete with peaked cap and jackboots.<br /><br />Oh, and she's got an eyepatch. Oh, yes.<br /><br />If that's not enough to sell you alone, you've got a race against the clock to locate the mysterious Doctor Totenkopf (Lawrence Olivier brought back from the Dead through the alchemy and black magic of high technology!) in his secret lair, before he can destroy the planet with his rampaging army of Deadly Giant Robots! And who can resist something that pulpy, to say nothing of something this gorgeous?<br /><br />To round off the festitivites, you get the shadowy evil operative Lai Bing (who fights as stylishly as she dresses), dinosaurs, death ray beams, and the Hindenburg docking on the Empire State Builiding (a scene that is almost painfully beautiful) and even huge guardian Robots with cyclopean attack lasers and wavy tentacles, and fiendish plots to kidnap scientists, and...<br /><br />Well, you get the idea. It's like being 9 years old all over again.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

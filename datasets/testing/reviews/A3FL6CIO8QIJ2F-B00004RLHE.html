Roy Neary, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a happy family man when, one night, a spaceship flys over him in his truck. This leads him to investigate the incident, with him ultimately losing everything he has, including his family; his investigation becomes a compulsion that even he can't control. The movie was one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1970's and is the best film that explores aliens and the unknown. This beautiful 2 disc DVD set is loaded with extras including interviews with Dreyfuss and Spielberg, 11 deleted scenes, a making-of documentary, a 1977 featurette called "Watching The Skies", plus much more. Rona Barrett from ABC said the film is "brilliant and nothing short of a masterpiece".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Harrison Ford's Worst Film"></head><body><p>Do not get suckered into seeing this ludicrous techno-thriller. Poorly written and directed, "Firewall" is Bad Cinema from the word go. The ever-heroic Harrison Ford stumbles into self-parody with his grim overacting - he's simply too old for this nonsense. A decent cast (Virginia Madsen, Paul Bettany and Mary Lynn Rajskub) is left stranded by the overall hopelessness. "Firewall" represents the absolute nadir of Ford's career.</p></body></html>

It's easy enough to appreciate the best of Hitchcock's films and to be jolted by them, but VERTIGO stands alone in its ability to move audiences emotionally. What's remarkable about this deservedly celebrated film, is that considering all its plot twists, VERTIGO definitely works even better after a first viewing. The film's genius is depicting such perversity as merely circumstance-crossed love. In other words, its genius is in revealing the perversity behind accepted "normal" practices. Once the secret's out, (and I ain't gonna spill it, folks!) it's a completely different film, and a better one - No longer a harrowing (albeit hokey) ghost story, it's a profound study of sexual obsession, tied together by the city which best displays the essential acrophobic metaphor. VERTIGO was not particularly successful at the time of its release in 1958; it is now considered one of Hitchcock's greatest films. The voyeuristic impulse behind Hitchcock's style is most immediately evident in the tourist sensibility that pervade his American films - a tourist will keep his careful distance from the grit of the world. Here, The Golden Gate Bridge, the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Podesta's flowershop, Ernie's restaurant, Coit Tower, Fort Point, etc. make up San Francisco's slick surface through Robert Burks's sharp edged Technicolor. Hitchcock's silent film mastery pays off in the scenes involving Scotty's extended tailing of Madeleine, accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's haunting score. A unique film experience and definitely one of the most fascinating and intricate movies of the last century!</p></body></html>

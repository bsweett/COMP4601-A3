Yet it wins a person over, voice by voice, visual by visual, and step-by-Depp. Johnny continues to amaze me with his versatility as an actor. He has become one of those guys who makes anything he is in better, even if he can't save them all (like Michael Caine in that respect.) Director Burton has filled the cast with great British character actor vocalizations, and the screen with oddball colors and drawings that amuse, frighten or delight. I think the best way to enjoy his version of "Alice" is to see the Disney animated 1950's effort first, which is great, and then the new twist on the story. If a mom or dad could read the poem "Jabberwocky" to the kids and explain a bit about Lewis Carroll, the author, first, so much the better. Burton does assume a certain literacy and familiarity with the tale and the poem that may give contemporary kids too much credit, but he has done a good job overall. If watching this version of "Alice" leads some young folk to read the original prose, hurrah!</p></body></html>

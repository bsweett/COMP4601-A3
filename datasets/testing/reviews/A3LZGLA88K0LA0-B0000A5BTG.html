It's a great movie because it's what you want from a disaster movie, and has a tremendously talented cast.  Aaron Eckhart is marvelous as the heroic Joshua Keyes---not your typical matinee idol handsome, Eckhart has a masculine tenacity, a lot of sensitivity, and performs his role as if it were a Shakesperean oddyssey.  Eckhart is the heart of the film.  Stanley Tucci is appropriately snooty, self-serving and annoying, yet even he metamorphasizes into an almost hero.  It's to Tucci's credit that he pulls this one off so well.  D. J. Qualls as Rat is awesome in his nerdish role as the computer hacker supreme.  Alfre Woodard in a small role shows why she's such a good supporting actress.  Delroy Lindo is great as the shy, soft-spoken inventor who finally breaks loose in a dramatic scenario.  Hilary Swank doesn't posit the &quot;I'm an Oscar winner...let me steal this movie.&quot;  She fills her role admirably and shows no signs of prima-donna hysterics.  Richard Jenkins and Bruce Greenwood fill out this cast.<br />I liked this movie a lot, as it reminded me of those great old disaster movies like &quot;Towering Inferno&quot; and &quot;Posiedon Adventure.&quot;  The effects, particularly of the birds going wacky in Trafalgar Square, are great.  See if you can find the trout which was included as an inside joke by director Amiel.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

So, he created one for her.  But this is no mere kid's film.  Hidden inside is an ode to the director's true passion: film preservation.  That's something that slid right by my nine-year-old nephew. He just thought it was a neat story - he liked the trains, the two young stars, Sasha Baron Cohen's hammy physical comedy, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225903">Brazil</a>-like catacombs in the train station, the clocks and other visual feats.  It's a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I liked learning about Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, seeing Ben Kingsley (a personal favorite) shine, getting a kick out of Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour (co-stars on stage and screen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJFO">The History Boys</a>) in small roles and building up my Scorsese portfolio.<br /><br />And, let's face it, I loved that train station, too.  In this master's hands, it's a magical place and a universe unto itself.</p></body></html>

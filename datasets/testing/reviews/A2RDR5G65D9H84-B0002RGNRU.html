<meta name="summary" content=""Please let me keep this memory""></head><body><p>This movie explores an interesting topic that will leave you thinking for a while. Based on the premise that it is possible to delete selective memories, the question pops up: is this the right way to go after a bad relationship? Keep in mind that in order for the procedure to be successful they have to delete every little memory connected to that person, so you would lose the bad recollections, but also the good ones. So, is the trade-off worthwhile?<br /><br />The film starts in a somewhat confusing way, when we see Joel (Carrey) following an impulse one morning, deciding to ditch work for the day and run off to Montauk. Once he gets there he meets Clementine (Winslet), a girl of eclectic tastes regarding her hair-style and who works at a bookstore. Not only does Clementine change his hair following her impulses, but she also does other things that way. For example the same day she meets Joel, she declares "I'm gonna marry you". As you can probably guess, we get the feeling that there is something weird going on, which is explained by the fact that these two people have met before, but have erased each other from their memories.<br /><br />Joel and Clementine had a two-year long relationship that had its good and bad times, and which was so intense that when it ended, they could not bear remembering the details of it. So they went to Lacuna and took care of the problem. Michael Gondry presents all this information using a combination of what is going on in the present and events from the past, as well as incorporating very interesting and creative scenes that show the process to which the mind is exposed to when erasing the memories.<br /><br />At some points we get to feel some anguish connected to what is happening to the main characters, and this in my mind is a reflection of how well they perform in their roles. Carrey have been showing for quite some time that he is not only a funny guy, but that he can really act, following a similar career path as Tom Hanks. For more evidence of Carrey's outstanding acting I recommend "The Majestic". In the case of Winslet, I have not been a very big fan of her, but here she excels at her role and I got the same positive impression as in "Finding Neverland". It seems that she is maturing in terms of her acting career and improving consistently. When most people see that the movie features Jim Carrey they automatically think "Comedy", and as you can guess by now, this is not the case of the present movie. As long as you are clear on that, and are not looking for laughs, I believe that you will find the experience interesting, to say the least.</p></body></html>

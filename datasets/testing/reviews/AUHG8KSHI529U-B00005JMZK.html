<meta name="summary" content="In the tradition of King Kong versus Godzilla"></head><body><p>OK, this is a silly movie.  That being said, it is yet another in a long tradition of movies such as "Frankentstein meets the Wereworlf" or "King Kong versus Godzilla".  The history and science is all wrong and the action is clearly preposterous.<br /><br />Those statements out of the way, this is actually a pretty good monster flick.  The effects are all good, the story is involving if predictable (you can see you will die and who will live pretty early on, but so what).<br /><br />Sanaa Lathan is very effective as the lead in the movie (a female lead is a tradition in the Alien flicks).  She says all the right things, is able to pull of the physical stuff, relate to the correct monster, and do all the things a strong lead has to do.  It was also nice to see Lance Henrickson bringing his wonderful presence to another Alien film.  Note the name Charles Bishop Weyland recaps the name of his name "Bishop" in Aliens.  While it will help you to have seen "Predator" and the first two "Alien" films (or even all of each), you can watch this without any knowledge of the monsters.<br /><br />This movie is rated PG-13 because it does scare young people and there are some swear words, and while there is fighting, killing, and some alien blood, it is not full of gore and awful human suffering as any of the original films.  The fright here more comes from anticipation and what you know just happened off screen.<br /><br />So, for the kind of film it is attempting to be, it is pretty good.  Get some popcorn and enjoy it with your young teenage kids.  We watched it in the extended version and I recommend that.</p></body></html>

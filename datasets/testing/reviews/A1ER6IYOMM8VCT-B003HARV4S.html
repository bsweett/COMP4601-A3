<meta name="summary" content="GOOD BUT, PREDICTABLE WITH  FLAT CHARACTERS!"></head><body><p>I watched this film knowing nothing about it,yet I was able to tell what was going to happen at many key instances of the film. Even though it is predictable, I thought the story was pretty good. I just didn't think the characters were well developed and the love between the two stars was not convincing. They show the two lovers as children for a matter of minutes and I didn't really see why the bond was so strong. It's an OK movie that I would never watch again because once the secrets out, there is nothing more to hold your interest. It's worth a rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first Narnia movie"></head><body><p>If you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>, I think you'll love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPH2">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</a>. Technically, as a piece of cinematography, the latter stands as a marked improvement over Andrew Adamson's first Narnia film. Better acting, better special effects, even better soundtrack. The plot also has more twists and turns, from the raid on the castle to the internecine fighting among the Telmarines.<br /><br />The Pevensie kids feel more comfortable with their roles, raising the level of acting up a notch. Between his accent and youthful demeanor, Ben Barnes has the right mix of prince and adventurer to fill the role of Prince Caspian. Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Trumpkin is a great addition, injecting sarcasm and cynicism into the dialogue. Even the minotaurs seem like better actors. When the rest of the army flees the enemy castle, a minotaur holds the gate open. That one act of self-sacrifice transforms the non-human Narnians into real characters, worthy of compassion, rather than mere special effects.<br /><br />For me, what makes this film much better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> is the rich villains. The Telmarines are a truly byzantine tribe of humans who invade the land of Narnia. They display a vile mix of treachery and military ethos that the White Witch, minotaur costumes, and CG wolves from the first movie just couldn't match. Their effectiveness really comes through during the raid on the castle. That battle - my favorite part of the entire film - is riveting and emotionally complex. The despair that seeps among the Narnian ranks after that defeat makes  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> a richer and more engaging movie than its predecessor.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPH2">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</a> doesn't break much new ground, and the general plot is the same, with an epic battle at the end. However, it represents a marked improvement over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> as a film. It's somewhat more mature and engaging, but still appropriate for kids. In short, if you liked the first one, you'll probably love Prince Caspian.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very trained in excellency!  Its a good good good movie!!"></head><body><p>I love this movie when i seen it about 2 years ago, and now I bought it on HD DVD.  I must say, it looks awesome.  I recommend this move and just feel the realism of the movie!  The actings is superberb, from Denzel to Macy Gray! It was absolutely a great movie to see how things can be so over powered by the dark to light and light to dark.  In one hand you have a good cop trying be persuaded to be a corrupted cop, and the other hand you have a good cop that turn bad.  Its a great movie!  Very Good!</p></body></html>

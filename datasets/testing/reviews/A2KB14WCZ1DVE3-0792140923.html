<meta name="summary" content="Salute to human decency"></head><body><p>This film has so many little things going for it.  Little things that add up to one big masterpiece.  The story of the slow-witted man who triumphs works, of course, because of the performance of Tom Hanks.  But there are a lot of other things that contributed. <p>First was the script.  I have a big problem with books being altered for movies, especially when they change the physical appearance and essence of the character.  They do that in this film, but I still make an exception because it took the character to new levels.  The book was funny and somewhat farcical, but that character was basically still a Southern hick.  This move adds a lot of dimension to this by showing the feelings this man has.  <p>But what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.  He ultimately triumphs because of his basic decency.  His determination to do the right thing, and stick with those he believes in gives him his ultimate rewards.  A world full of Forrest Gumps would not produce super-computers, but it would be a world where people get along a lot better than they do in the current one.</p></body></html>

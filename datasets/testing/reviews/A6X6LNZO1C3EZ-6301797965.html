Gene Hackman has an amazing role as the blind hermit, making this film as good as any comedy I've ever seen in his segment. It was years later before I realized the guy playing the monster, Peter Boyle is the dad on Everybody Loves Raymond. He's hilarious here in this movie. Marty Feldman could do anything he wanted to in the comedy genre and be entertaining, and this movie bears that out perfectly where Marty plays the part of Igor. Frau Blucher played by Cloris Leachman seems to be a role tailor made for her, and the mention of her name in the movie makes the horses nervous. Teri Garr has some moments in the film to make young boys successfully get through puberty, and Madeline Kahn is excellent for her portrayal of an annoying conceited nincompoop woman engaged to Gene Wilder's character - Dr. Frankenstein. Mel Brooks was the howl of a werewolf and the voice of a cat accidentally hit by a dart, but otherwise doesn't appear in this film - which really surprised me since he has important roles out in front for most of his movies. I thought attention to detail was good for the sets, and was pleasantly surprised by the casting. Very enjoyable, and definitely worth buying this DVD. If you want a high definition version, buy it in Blu-ray. Very entertaining and funny film.  I recommend it without a doubt.</p></body></html>

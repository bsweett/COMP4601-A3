<meta name="summary" content="Sasha Baron Cohen Offends Again!"></head><body><p>I fell in love with Borat when he became my favorite character on the Da Ali G Show.  I am an ESOL Teacher and find other cultures interesting.  While it is very possible to see Sasha Baron Cohen's characterization of a Kazakhstan immigrant offensive, I think it has a lot more to do with how Americans deal with people from other countries and their beliefs of people who live in them.  Cohen seems determine to get Americans to take a look at their prejudices whether they are out there in plain sight or hidden under the guise of "tolerance".  I do have complaints about how hard he leans on gay jokes which I believe he is uncomfortable with, and the naked fight scene goes on far too long and offensively.  Of course, that is what Cohen sees as his bread and butter - giving offense to everyone and everybody.  I guess that includes me because I was not immune.</p></body></html>

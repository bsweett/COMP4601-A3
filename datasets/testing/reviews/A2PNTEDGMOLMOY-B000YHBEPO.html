<meta name="summary" content="High-gloss popcorn entry into "MI" franchise"></head><body><p>"Mission Impossible III" is a definitive summer popcorn movie.  It's got amazing special effects, outlandish stunts, handsome heroes and gorgeous heroines, and a plot that is as thin as tissue paper.  All in all, a perfect afternoon's escape from the summer heat.<br /><br />If you are looking for a complex plot out of a Le Carre novel, you'll be disappointed in this movie, but then you knew that, didn't you?  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) tries to save the planet and his wife (Michelle Monaghan, from "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang," a much wittier film) from the evil Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, cashing in on his best actor Oscar from "Truman").  Davian is some kind of evil gun runner who sells weapons of mass destruction to Bad Guys, and he and Hunt are fighting over the Rabbit's Foot, an undescribed weapon with unimaginable destructive power that also conveniently fits into a small briefcase.  Alfred Hitchcock would call this the "MacGuffin."<br /><br />This "plot" is an excuse to string together some incredibly clever and outlandish "ops" for the Mission Impossible Team.  From an early scene where Hunt and his team rescue a captured MI member to a kidnapping in the Vatican to some highwire escapades in Shanghai, Hunt and his gang offer visual thrills galore.<br /><br />Leave your disbelief at the door, don't try to figure out the physics or the logic, and just have a good time watching attractive people do unimaginably spectacular things.  (And try to forget that Tom Cruise is, you know, insane.)</p></body></html>

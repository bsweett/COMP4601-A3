<meta name="summary" content="OK, but didn't live up to its potential"></head><body><p>It started out with a bang and I was so enthralled.  But Day-Lewis' character really bored me in the end. And the story too. Lewis's character was so odd and one-dimensional.  And frankly, I don't understand why he won Best Actor?!  It was like he was re-playing the bloody, violent, wild-eyed part from GANGS OF NEW YORK and I was disappointed.  Doesn't he play anything else?  Is that all that interests him in a role?  OK this one he has a kid, or an adopted kid, and that opens up possiblities. But honestly for such a reknowned actor I'd think he could find some more variety in his roles. C'est la vie, it's his choice of course.</p></body></html>

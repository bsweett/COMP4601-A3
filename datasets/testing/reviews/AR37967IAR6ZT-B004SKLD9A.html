<meta name="summary" content="Uneven movie with a good premise. But the violence is cool."></head><body><p>I saw this movie with four friends of mine, and we all left the theater with vastly different opinions about it. Though we all agreed that the action scenes were incredibly done, I found them out of place in this film. The premise regarding a world free of emotion, if executed better, could've been interesting, but, by the end, "Equilibrium" left me unconvinced about its points.<p>Christian Bale plays John Preston, a law enforcement officer who goes about assuring that everyone in society is without emotion. The society controls the emotional responses of its people through drugs and use of the martial arts. (The martial arts in the film, used with guns in a stunning, if bafflingly incoherent, provide its best effects.) Preston, over time, begins skipping his treatments, though he's initially a stalwart in favor of the old system. <p>As he develops emotions, in scenes that aren't quite convincing because actors pretending not to convey emotions come off as wooden (whether or not it's a plot device), Preston begins fighting the establishment, caring for his kids and caring for his old partner's lover, a renegade art-lover played by Emily Watson. (I'm not entirely sure if this is supposed to be some sidebar love story, for it's hard to be convinced when Christian Bale doesn't play up emotions in this, or any, regard.)<p>The movie lost me with its use of the cute puppy dog. Bale finds that, with emotions, he can't shoot the poor thing in the head, even though it's required of his job. Instead of shooting the dog, though, he guns down about 15 men trying to kill the dog. Where's the emotion and morality in that? One cute dog we can't kill, but let's violently dispatch a whole bunch of people because they don't have emotions and want to kill us. It's weirdly uneven, and the scene of him gunning down the people, then embracing the furry creature and crying is just silly.<p>Don't waste your time. Though it's action-packed and sorta has a moral point to it, it's unconvincing.</p></body></html>

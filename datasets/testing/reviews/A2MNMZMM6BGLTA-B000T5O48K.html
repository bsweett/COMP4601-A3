I found the movie to be a really compelling movie about mental illness. I thought the trailer and advertising campaign was totally misleading leading people to believe it was a horror movie where you would expect some alien species or some crazed bugs attacking people ala The Swarm. It was nothing like that at all. Also, I have heard when reading a critique of the play that it was a black or dark comedy. I didn't see this at all and didn't think there was anything funny about it at all. I thought it was good. I recommend it but I do think that it is not for everybody. There is a lot of disturbing material here.</p></body></html>

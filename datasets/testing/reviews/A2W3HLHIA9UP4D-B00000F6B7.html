<meta name="summary" content="The Best Star Trek movie??"></head><body><p>After being dissapointed with the first Star Trek motion picture, I was greatly surprised with Star Trek II. The original crew appear to be back in pretty much top form. I felt they were a bit rusty in the first film as far as acting together as a group. There are also some key new characters added that bring a whole lot to the film as well. The overall plot is much better than that of the first film too. It was brilliant to bring back a character from an episode of the orginal series, Khan, and really make it work. If you're just a casual fan of the Star Trek series and haven't watched many of the original episodes, you might want to get your hands on the "Space Seed" episode. You, by no means, NEED to watch this episode before viewing this film to understand it, but it might make you aprreciate it a little more in the long run. But if you're a fan to begin with, its basically like watching one of your favorite Star Trek episodes, except on a greater scale. In my opinion, if you're looking for the definitive Star Trek movie, this is it.</p></body></html>

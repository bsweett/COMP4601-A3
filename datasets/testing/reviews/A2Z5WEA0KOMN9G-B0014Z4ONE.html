<meta name="summary" content="It's about time."></head><body><p>It's about time that this series came out on DVD and after watching Raider's of the Lost Ark, I'm glad they waited.  I bought the DVD and couldn't wait to get it home so that I could watch it.  I turned off the lights, popped some popcorn and sat down to watch it.  Besides getting greeted with a pristine picture, the sound was amazing.  The arrows and stuff at the beginning of the movie came out from all directions and it felt like I was 12 again and watching the movie for the first time.  It's a shame that this wasn't done sooner, but I can kind of understand why.<p>Now if Mr. Lucas would release his other trilogy on DVD, I will be very happy.</p></body></html>

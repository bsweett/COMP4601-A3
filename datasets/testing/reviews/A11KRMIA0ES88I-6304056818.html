<meta name="summary" content="Forbidden Planet"></head><body><p>Shakespeare's "Tempest" is the model for this exceptional science fiction film. I looked for differences. Prospero and Miranda are stranded on a Mediterranean island. Morbius and his daughter are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair. Ariel is a spirit. Robby the Robot is a man-made servant. Caliban's evil does not match that of Monsters of the Id. Shakespeare spares Prospero. Morbius dies when Altair 4 blows up. We wonder if mankind will suffer the same fate as the Krell.</p></body></html>

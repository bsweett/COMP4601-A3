<meta name="summary" content="The Trojan war on screen"></head><body><p>This is one of the best efforts Hollywood has ever put forth to make a genuine and tasteful production of a classic mythological story.  While the Trojan war is thought to be a historical event, much of the details in Homer were the stuff of legend, not history.<br /><br />Eric Bana and Brad Pitt are both buffed up and believable as Greek warriors.  I was skeptical of Pitt being cast as Achilles, but he turned out a surprisingly good performance.  Peter O'Toole is a natural as Priam, and Orlando Bloom plays Paris as every bit the wimp he is in the ILIAD.<br /><br />To be sure, the writers took a great many liberties in the storyline.  However, this made for a nice and cohesive plot.  In particular, I was impressed by the clever way in which they re-wrote the duel between Paris and Menelaous, as well as their blowing up the character of Chrysalias into a major & pivotal persona.  In Homer we barely get to know her at all.<br /><br />After seeing the film, some friends of mine complained that Achilles was not likeable enough.  Actually, the Achilles in TROY is far more likeable than the one in Homer's epic.  In my mind, they did a great job of making him as likeable as possible without divorcing him from the character in Homer's poem.<br /><br />Eric Bana is remarkable as Hector.  Some people I know were surprised that he is depicted as in most ways more heroic than Achilles.  After all, Hector fights for all the right reasons.  This, too, is consistent with the ILIAD.  Also, TROY is a good name for the film as ILIAD alludes to Ilion, which was another name for Troy.<br /><br />As a nice bonus, there are some scenes from and allusions to Virgil's AENEID.  This makes the production value even more endearing to the viewer.<br /><br />Whether you have ever read Homer / Virgil or not, I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  It has a nice 2nd disc of special features that includes an overview of the Greek pantheon (although some detail on Homer would have been nice as well).  I would recommend both the movie AND the book.  I would also recommend watching HELEN OF TROY, which is a DVD that focuses on different aspects of the myth.</p></body></html>

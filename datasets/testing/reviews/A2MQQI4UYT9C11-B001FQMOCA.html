<meta name="summary" content="Reese Gives  Best Performance of the Year and Second Best of the Movie"></head><body><p>We watched this multiple Academy Award nominee on DVD, having missed it in the theatre.  My daughter is a big Reese Witherspoon fan and my wife grew up near Nashville--so the movie seemed like a good fit.  I didn't find anything terribly wrong with it.  At one level it seemed a lot like "Ray", the biopic of Ray Charles, but maybe that's just because the lives of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles traveled similar paths.  The most surprising thing to me was all the fuss about Witherspoon's performance--she was a consensus favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar and did so.  Her singing was a nice surprise, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix was much stronger in his role as Johnny Cash.</p></body></html>

Two years into his divorce Miles (Giamatti) has sunk into a depressive funk so deep he is prone towards unintentionally but automatically sabotaging everything around him.  His latest novel is passed over for publication, and nothing is going right for him.  Jack (Haden Church) is a sunny-dispositioned, womanizing, has been soap actor eking out a life doing commercials and out for one last go at bachelor freedom.  Together, they are quite a pair.<br /><br />During the trip they meet and woo local wine country gals Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen, each of them just about as different as the boys.<br /><br />One of the highlights of the film - and not a comical one - is Virginia Madsen as Maya describing why she loves wine - describing the "life" of a bottle of wine in a manner that wine truly and instantly comes alive:  the words and Madsen's delivery of them is nothing less than astonishing, powerfully moving combining the sensual and spiritual.<br /><br />Everything about Sideways resonated strongly, beautifully, sadly and hilariously for me.  Like a good wine, the older you get, the better this movie will be.</p></body></html>

Knowing the nature of the plot and seeing the low average rating here on amazon.com, I wasn't expecting to love this film, but I hoped that I'd like it a little more than I actually did.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughy plays Tripp, a 35 year old man who still lives with his parents, and is proud of it, as are his best friends. Tripp's parents, at a party full of other parents with kids still at home, hear about a woman who deals with this sort of thing (Sarah Jessica Parker). For a fee, she'll go out with the stay-at-home guy, pretend to fall in love with him, and convince him to move out of his parent's place and into hers. Tripp's parents agree to the deal, and the professional launcher gets to work. However, unlike her previous clients, Tripp's situation is a tangled one, one that ends up getting the usually professional woman all tangled up herself.<br /><br />A thirty something year old man still living with his parents isn't exactly a plot I found appealing (a bit depressing actually) but then again it could have been handled a lot worse, I thought. The plus about this plot is that I never knew (at least for the first hour or so) which way it was going to go, and how it was going to end. The supporting characters are more interesting than I would have guessed too. The trouble is, nothing that's really entertaining actually happens. There's a lot of slapstick stuff with animals (which I really didn't expect) but I didn't find it that funny. The film, towards the end, also feels like it is drawn out. It is only an hour and a half film, but it felt much longer to me. Also, towards the end, the film tries to get a little more dramatic and plays a few of the characters (Tripp, Tripp's parents) "deeper" than they are in the beginning, with issues and such. Doesn't really gel well, I don't think, and just makes things feel even more dragged out.<br /><br />There are many and varied special features on this DVD, including a making of documentary, original theatrical trailer, and an interview with Matthew McConaughy and Terry Bradshaw. It's a shame I didn't like the movie too much, otherwise I'm sure I would have found these more appealing.<br /><br />There are lots of romantic comedies to choose from, and I'd recommend you choose something other than "Failure to Launch". In terms of entertainment, it didn't really get off the ground for me.</p></body></html>

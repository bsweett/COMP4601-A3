Is it fair to compare them? Of course, because growing up with Christopher Reeve as "the" only superman makes me an expert skeptic, and with all the remakes and rip offs out there now, if you choose to make one you must be open to comparison. Superman is a seminal character in comic book, pop culture and movie history, essentially an alien story he has become the ultimate earth champion. I was afraid that making a new superman movie would pull him out of his gentleman old fashioned movie star ways, and recast him as some idiotic CGI modern superstar. Thank God they got it right!<br /><br />From the opening scene, with Brando's voice I just knew they were going to honor what came before. Brandon Routh is eerily similar to Reeves, both in looks and mannerisms. I am not sure how much of that is planned, or if Routh just carries himself the same way. Kevin Spacey as Lex is also like looking at Gene Hackman they both can carry off the "sneering, comical criminal mastermind", and look darn good bald. In the original movies I personally couldn't stand Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. Kidder never embodied Lane the way the comics fleshed her out to be, a strong reporter headstrong woman but feminine and just a bit na?ve, She was to abrasive and manly and quite frankly not all that attractive. So I hoped they would cast a better Lois, and that is the only thing they failed in. Kate Bosworth? Who's range of acting roles at this point have been to play surfers and horse lovers and Sandra Dee (who she also messed up). She is really a blonde, and the wig they used for her was awful, too high on her forehead. She is also too skinny and angular and just has one face for every single emotion. Routh deserved a better Lois just as Reeves did. As for the character of Kitty, played by the marvelous genius Parker Posey (who should have been Lane instead) she almost stole that movie altogether.<br /><br />As for the content of this movie, the plot, it was acceptable. They kept it simple and straightforward and executed it correctly without going too overboard and inserting too many CGI moments. (if you have ever read my reviews I abhor the misuse of CGI) the only time I cringed a bit was the close up of Superman flying and it was obviously not a green screen profile. The costumes were magnificent (love the new Superoutfit), the sets were breathtaking,  Bryan Singer made his own Superman, while honoring the old, and that is how it should be.</p></body></html>

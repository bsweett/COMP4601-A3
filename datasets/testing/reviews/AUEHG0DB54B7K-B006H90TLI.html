However, neither of us liked Fargo at first and also agreed that No Country for Old Men needs to be seen more than once for a complete appreciation.  The film is beautifully photographed (with New Mexico standing in for Texas) making optimal use of the wide vistas.  The performances, particularly by Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, are superb.  Tommy Lee Jones is the quintessential Western sheriff, coming from a long line of sheriffs, and is still a resourceful lawman but a bit tired as well.  Javier Bardem turns in a remarkable performance as Chigurh, an unstoppable assassin who methodically kills just about everyone who crosses his path.  When he is uncertain about snuffing out someone he will let his decision fall to a coin toss.  There is a scene early in the film when Chigurh offers a coin toss to a clerk; the dialogue is masterly, with Javier Barden being vague in a sinister way and the clerk attempting to understand what is going on, that is an example of the marvelous acting and superb editing of the film.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is perfect as the money-driven Llewelyn Moss.  Mr. Brolin has had a very good year with excellent performances in American Gangster and No Country for Old Men. One minor point that I was wondering about is he really a Vietnam Vet?  Moss appears to be younger than a man who served two tours and the answers he given a border guard about his military service could have information from a father or uncle.  The supporting roles are well cast.  Woody Harrelson has some great scenes as Chigurh former partner who has been given a contract to take him out and Kelly Macdonald is wonderful as Llewelyn's wife who ends up becoming a victim of her husband's greed.<br /><br />I have not read of Cormac McCarthy's novel but understand that the Coen brothers have faithfully followed the book including the unresolved story elements.  One difficulty with No Country for Old Men is that as the story unfolds you might be a bit lost with who some of the characters are.  My wife and I were attempting to identify on what side of the drug deal (gone fatally wrong) some of the characters were on.  We presumed that the business man who given Woody Harrelson his contract for Chigurh was in on the drug deal but his connection is never explained.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men is loaded with suspense and tension.  It is not a fast-paced film but is never boring and has a kind or moral: don't take what does not belong to you.</p></body></html>

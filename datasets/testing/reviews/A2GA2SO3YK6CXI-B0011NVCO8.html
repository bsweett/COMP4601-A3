<meta name="summary" content="A must see film"></head><body><p>American Gangster provides a rare view into a USA that most of us, thank God for that, fail to see.<br /><br />Frank Lucas, played by Denzel Washington is a Harlem crime lord that grows up in the shadow of a great man, who teaches him great life lessons, but also... to become a criminal.<br /><br />Frank Lucas is able to amass wealth at the expense of drug addicts, bringing heroin, directly from Asia, during the Viet-Nam war. The key to this story is that the US army supports his efforts and is the means for the distribution and entry of drugs into the USA.<br /><br />The intricate web of support created by Frank Lucas is under observation by a New Jersey cop by the name of Richie Roberts, played masterfully by Russell Crowe. He is a cop who studies law and passes the bar, something that allows him to understand the consequences of each and every action and makes him a rather interesting character.<br /><br />Richie Roberts is honest to a fault, not taking kick-backs, even when it appears that no one is looking and that it is in his best interest to do what all other cops are doing. The subject of good versus evil in this movie is a constant force that makes us be riveted on the screen.<br /><br />Frank Lucas follows rules that protect him, trying hard to NEVER call attention to his person, but falls prey to the vanity of wearing a chinchilla coat his wife purchases for him. His beautiful Puerto-Rican wife fully understands who he is, and yet at some point, you can sense the guilt of never having confronted her husband to MAKE him leave a life that ultimately destroys their marriage. Frank Lucas' mother never questions all she gets from what she suspects is illegal... but at some point tries to save her son by "hitting" some sense into his life.<br /><br />A must see, perhaps one of the best movies we have seen lately!</p></body></html>

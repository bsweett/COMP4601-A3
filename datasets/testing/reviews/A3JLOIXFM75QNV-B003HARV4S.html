<meta name="summary" content="A refreshingly entertaining film"></head><body><p>I think this one came as a surprise for many people. Going into it, I didnt think anything of it. But it was actually quite good and one of the better films from last year. Edward Norton's character is a skilled magician who once lost a girl that he loved. Years later, they reuinite, and that is where the movie gets exciting. And mysterious. I love the look of the film, the dreary muted colors, the constant sadness in Norton's eyes. It all works. And its all very effective in setting the mood. The ending is completely believable and rewarding. There are no plot holes that I noticed, it all flows very well. All in all, a movie not to be taken seriously, but still a really really good film.</p></body></html>

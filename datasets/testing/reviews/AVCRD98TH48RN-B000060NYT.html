Then along comes this movie with a very corny title and I think to myself &quot;Why am I putting this into my DVD player?&quot;  Twenty minutes into the film I was smiling with relief and jumping with tension.  The first half of this movie has inspired direction influenced by the likes of Stephen Spielberg(Duel) and the cult director Sam Raimi's &quot;Evil Dead&quot; films.  There are genuine scares and some fun camerawork for about 45 minutes....then the movie becomes a bloody X-files episode.  I was seriously expecting Mulder and Scully to show up at any moment, Scully's intro into the scene: &quot;Excuse me, sir.  We're Federal agents investigating the strange stories reported recently.&quot;  While the second half of the movie isn't bad it seemed like the director just wanted to wrap things up and hope for a call saying United Artists wanted to back a sequel.  Part 2 is on video as I write this.  Still, this movie has more pinache than most horror films and is certainly worth a look.</p></body></html>

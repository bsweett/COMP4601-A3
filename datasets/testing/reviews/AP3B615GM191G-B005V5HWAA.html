<meta name="summary" content="A Creepy, Thoughtful Thriller"></head><body><p>While some movies try to thrill you with a sub-standard plot, and others try to make you think and end up getting you confused, this movie finds the perfect balance between the two.<br /><br />The premise is that the main character, a successful, highly-regarded doctor played by Kevin Costner, finds his mind suddenly haunted by the overwhelming urge to commit murder.  After a run as the most notorious serial killer in his home town, "Costner" thought he had put those demons to bed...only to be reacquainted with them once again, this time with a thriving career and family.<br /><br />Two psychological factors really made this movie memorable to me: First, is how absolutely compelling "Costner's" murdering impulses are.  No matter what he tries (until the end, when his entire life is thrown into question), he can't seem to shake them.  Secondly, because of that absolute obsession, Costner's character actually becomes sympathetic.  Despite the fact that he is murdering people in cold blood, he still feel for him, knowing that in some way he wants to break free as much as we want him to.<br /><br />Overall, this film stuck with me awhile after viewing it, as it grapples with the age-old philosophical debate of why humans kill other humans?  The film suggests that the violent, horrifying personas we stereotype serial killers as could be completely false...and that is really where the creepiness lies.  The urge could be in any one of us.</p></body></html>

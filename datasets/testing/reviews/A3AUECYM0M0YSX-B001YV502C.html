<meta name="summary" content="Self-important twaddle"></head><body><p>It's a political thriller filled with horrifying implications about our future, implications we'd really rather not face. It's timely, it's hard-hitting, and all that. So naturally I was curious and wanted to see this film that wise critics told me was foretelling our possible fate. And so I rented Black Sunday recently.<br /><br />And 30 years later, the film doesn't show its age very well. It's very rooted in the 70s. It is filled with more "movie moments" than genuine truths, though those moments are well-disguised.<br /><br />And that about sums up Children of Men, too. It's trying so hard to be Important. It's obviously a protest against the current war on terror and all the infighting it has generated. But it's based on a red herring--or a gimmick, to put it less charitably--and it's about as subtle as a boulder falling off a thousand foot cliff.<br /><br />Folks, the issue we'll be facing in the near future won't be wars stemming from underpopulation (why terrorists are at war on this is never really explained), it will be on *over*population. More specifically, overpopulation with dwindling natural resources, and electorates everywhere who have done nothing past lip service because they're busy stuffing their pockets with donations from those who control the existing natural resources. *That's* a topic I'd like to see a grim movie like this tackle. But it just might make theater-goers a little uncomfortable as they climb into their Hemi pickups and SUVs afterwards.<br /><br />So instead we get this self-important movie that either the NY or LA Times (I forget which) says frightens us because we know, deep down, this could be our future. I'd say it's watchable and enjoyable because deep down we know this isn't our future. Is there really an infertility epidemic going on that I'm unaware of? There are grave problems threatening us today, and not one of them is in this film. There's not much in this film, really. It's a cleverly-disguised action thriller, Mad Max meets Brazil (both better movies, btw).<br /><br />In addition to the red herring of infertility (which is never explained, by the way...Nor do we have any reason to believe the child at the end will survive any better than anyone else, especially since she's a preemie, so the whole ending felt pointless to me), there's the infighting. Here the message is obvious, driven home by power tools, and in case you're out getting popcorn during this bit the director constantly has huge overbearing signs in all the locations with messages like "Report Suspicious Activity." Yes, I know there are really such signs nowadays. Yes, I get the indictment of what's going with British and American governments currently. Anyone who hasn't been lobotomized gets it. But after beating us up with it, the filmmakers don't develop it, doesn't make a point past the obvious one. By contrast, look at the odyssey the central character in Brazil undergoes, and how it affects both him and the people he loves and looks out for.<br /><br />What stymied me after watching Children of Men was that such a one-dimensional movie impressed all the high-brow critics. Then I went back and reread the 1970s reviews for Black Sunday and understood. So often films that seem so foretelling look naive a couple decades later. It's hard to predict the weight of your warning when you are so close to it--and this film is very emotionally-close to its subject. I make the prediction right here and now that this film will play very different on our consciousness 30 years from now, as environmental warnings from the 70s about an impending ice age do today.<br /><br />And this wasn't particularly groundbreaking filmmaking either. We have a standard stock of characters here: the reluctant hero who rediscovers his idealism after a great personal loss, the old flame who reunites him with his past ways (and geeze, Julianne Moore has one of the most heavy-handed, literally un-believable entrances in screen history here), the sacrificing fatherly figure (did anyone not know how that part was going to end?), the shining young woman who represents Hope, and so on.<br /><br />Children of Men is the latest in a line of Syrianna/Constant Gardener/Traffic-type films, with sprawling plots, timely messages, a documentary look, lots of violence, a backdrop of decaying society, large cast of characters, etc.  Except the other films had valid conceits.  That's the difference.<br /><br />The disc looks great, however, and there's plenty of bangy-boomy sound to give your subwoofers a workout. There are several small featurettes about the making of the film, including a nifty pieces demonstrating worldlessly how they created the CGI baby. No trailer, oddly. But after you, not believing my review, rent this anyway, go see Brazil, a far deeper film that has turned out to be eerily accurate about how things are shaping up (terrorist wars that drag on and bankrupt governments, governments that are pennywise and pound foolish, drone workers whose only escape is disembodied fantasy, trying to achieve immortality through plastic surgery, wrapped presents that are destroyed at checkpoints, consumerism run rampant and in the guise of patriotism or religious fervor). That's the difference between a pseudo-intellectual movie and a film that really makes you think.</p></body></html>

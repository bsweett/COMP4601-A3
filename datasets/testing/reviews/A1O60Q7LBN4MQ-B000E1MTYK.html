<meta name="summary" content="Fun movie"></head><body><p>I enjoyed it but I wish they wouldn't make movies so long. Two hours is long enough. And I have to admit I liked the kids better when they were younger. I really liked the first Harry Potter. Of course the special effects is great. Don't have a lot to say one this one, except it was fun and J.K. Rowling writing talents is truly amazing. What an imagination!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>The Iron Man 2 sequel begins in Moscow.  It is snowing outside, while an old man, Anton Vanko, lay dying in his bed, his son Ivan sitting next to him.  Apparently Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark) and Anton had worked together many years ago developing plans, but Howard had Anton shipped off to Siberia where he lived the rest of his life in poverty, while Howard Stark became filthy rich. Needless to say, Ivan is a bit upset when daddy dies.  He grabs some plans and starts working feverishly on an Iron Man "heart".<br /><br />Back in New York, Tony Stark is telling the world he is Iron Man and celebrating with a big Expo celebration for single-handedly achieving world peace.  He is summoned to Washington DC to testify before some Senate Committee and asked to turn over the Iron Man suit to the government because it is a weapon.  Of course, his answer is no.<br /><br />Back in Stark's ocean-front Malibu home, we find out the paladium core so vital to Iron Man is also killing Tony slowly by increasing his blood toxicity levels.  Not telling Gwenyth Paltrow, he appoints her CEO of Stark Industries and his successor, if anything happens to him.<br /><br />In the famous Monaco street race is where bad-guy Ivan catches up with Tony.  He comes at him with a bad attitude and a bad invention he has cooked up in his little make-shift Moscow lab.<br /><br />There is a lot of action that follows with the good-guy/bad-guy thing while Tony is trying to find something to keep him from paladium meltdown.  The CGI is great and the Iron Man characters are bigger than life.<br /><br />I thought the first one was better, maybe because the concept was new or maybe because I waited for this one for awhile.  In any case, the movie was still excellent and well worth seeing.  It was hard to believe that Ivan was Mickey Rourke.  He just looked so totally different to me.</p></body></html>

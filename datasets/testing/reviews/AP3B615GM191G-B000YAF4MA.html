<meta name="summary" content="A Bit Cheesy, But Superbly Acted"></head><body><p>When this film first hit theaters back in 2007, it spawned a whole collection of "Bucket Lists" (a list of things to do before you "kick the bucket", as the saying goes).  It seemed a little sappy and contrived ("can those two old goats really carry a film these days?" was one of my mindsets), so it took me until now to see it.  I wish I would have "relented" sooner!<br /><br />Basically, the plot of this film centers on two characters: the filthy-rich, uptight Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and the family-loving, laid-back Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).  The two happen to meet while sharing a hospital bed, and (though grudgingly at first) begin to form a bond over their advancing ages.  When Cole notices a strange "Bucket List" scrawled out on a napkin by Chambers, he decides to make the list a reality.  The two gallivant around the country together, embarking on such journeys as skydiving, seeing the Pyramids, and climbing a mountain (to name a few).<br /><br />In terms of evaluating the overall plot of the movie, it is always sincere, bordering on downright sappiness or pure cheese.  If you can get past the idea that the two "old codgers" are doing things that would completely tax men half their age, the story will suck you in.  If not, you won't buy in and thus miss the emotional payoff in the final scenes.<br /><br />However, whatever credibility issues arise from the plot, the film is so superbly acted that it almost doesn't even matter.  The chance to watch such legends as Nicholson and Freeman work their magic together is an opportunity that should not be missed.  These men, contrary to the "pretty boys" and "sex symbols" of the current generation, are the cream of the crop in terms of dramatics and emotional performances.  So, even if the plot doesn't hook you in, just watching those two stalwarts act will provide much enjoyment!<br /><br />Thus, though not an instant classic or anything like that, "The Bucket List" is a charming little film that will make you laugh, perhaps even shed a tear at the end, and leave you contemplating your own life and relationship with those around you.</p></body></html>

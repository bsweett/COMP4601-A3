<meta name="summary" content="Good acting, great special effects, but too truncated"></head><body><p>This film version has the outer trappings of the great story, but it is so shortened that it loses a large part of its soul.  In the book, the characters are important and have intricate relationships, which are successfully portrayed in the BBC version.  However, the Disney version cuts most of it out, except for the extremely obvious.  So what is left is an adventure, with baddies warring against the goodies.  The last quarter of the film is the battle itself, which is graphically violent and excessively detailed.  The digital effects are quite spectacular, but again, this masks a rather hollow core.  What you end up with is a visual spectacle that disappoints if you want the deeper themes that are in the books.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly, as a pass time but not a literary experience.  As the recent Lord of the Rings Trilogy shows, a film version can succeed as a literary experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable blend of traditional Disney sensibilities with a modern, Pixar influence"></head><body><p>I was not terribly enthusiastic about seeing TANGLED, and in fact, I didn't see it for several weeks.  But a slow Sunday afternoon came around, and having seen pretty much everything else...I was coaxed into attending.  And now the film is on my Top 10 for 2010 list!<br /><br />This is a Disney picture, with the graphic sensibilities of a Pixar film.  I know the two companies are allied, but what I mean is this:  Pixar has had the corner on smart, modern looking, genre-twisting films.  Nary a fairy-tale in sight.  And Disney has the lock on the "princess" fairy tale.  Heroine tackles adventures, including some kind of wicked witch-type character, with the help of her animal sidekicks and to a greater-or-lesser degree, the help of a male character destined to be her one true love.  And generally, the Disney movie is in the old, hand-drawn style (such as the excellent PRINCESS AND THE FROG).<br /><br />But with TANGLED, we get a terrific "princess" story, coupled with outstanding CGI animation from Pixar.  It's in 3D, and features the best 3D of the year, in my opinion.  There's a gorgeous scene where thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky at once, and as they carry over a lake, their number is multiplied by the reflection in the water.  The moment is jaw-dropping in its beauty...and to be honest, it's worth the price of the 3D upgrade.<br /><br />TANGLED is the story (loosely) of Rapunzel...the girl who is kept in a tall tower by a wicked old woman who accesses the tower by climbing Rapunzel's LOOOONG hair.  In this film, Rapunzel isn't merely rescued by a roaming prince.  She's spunky, smart and na?ve about the world about her.  She yearns to leave, even for a short time...and when fate puts a reluctant rescuer in her path (in the form of Flynn Rider...a charming bandit), she sets off on an adventure full of excitement, humor & romance.  And Rapunzel, with her blonde hair and green eyes, looks refreshingly different from Disney beauties of the past.<br /><br />It sounds very tired...but trust me, Disney makes all the old stand-by themes seem new and fresh.  The animal sidekicks:  a cute-as-can-be chameleon and a tough-as-nails horse.  Song about yearning to see another part of the world:  yep, but it's cute and touching.  Colorful villains: check, but this gang gets to sing one of the funniest songs since Gaston used antlers in his decorating in BEAUTY & THE BEAST.  Chase scenes:  a couple of good ones, including one featuring a collapsing dam.  Pretty scenery:  yep.  This movie has it all.<br /><br />There are minor problems here and there.  A king and queen who never speak for some reason.  Flynn looks vaguely generic (he's a fun character, though).  But really, the film delivered all I could hope for.  See it...and don't just drag the kids; bring the adults too!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Magic and Amazement Continues"></head><body><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the darkest Potter film to date.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his fellow Hogwarts students continue to fight evil as well as hone their skills as wizards.  In his unrelenting attempt to avenge the death of his parents by the demonic Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who appears in and out of the film, Harry never gives up his untiring efforts.  For the premise of this film, Hogwarts's leadership is under scrutiny that involves accusations against Harry and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and one of the new characters, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), the annoying and sinister teacher who is after the coveted title as headmaster.<br /><br />The film is extremely long.  But as with the other four Potter films, the cinematography and special effects are exceptional.  The pyrotechnics are loud and shattering, especially the concluding scenes where Dumbledore battles it out with Voldemort, which resonates duel-like scenes from very well known sci-fi film, such as Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.<br /><br />Thus far, the storyline is complex and intense as the characters battle good and evil.  And another interesting observation is how Harry and his friends continue to grow before our eyes. Yet again, Harry experiences one of his first pubescent encounters with his ongoing romance with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and the two share an unavoidable intimate kiss under the mistletoe, which he describes somewhat immaturely to Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) as very wet; we also see the ever so delicate and sensitive Neville (Matthew Lewis) slowly mature with confidence.<br /><br />Harry and the Order of the Phoenix has fantasy and adventure that many Potter fans have grown accustomed to.  As the characters and film content matures, this particular film may appeal to older children and adults.  Otherwise, the Potter films never ceases to amaze.</p></body></html>

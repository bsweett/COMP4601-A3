<meta name="summary" content="It still has me thinking (which is a good thing)"></head><body><p>This is a rather odd little movie, but I think that's a big part of why I liked it.  The timespan covered by the movie is only a day, in fact focusing on only a few minutes of that day, and only a handful of people are involved, yet the movie is able to deftly explore a lot of important themes from a lot of angles via that small slice of life.  The acting is also very good, with nothing being overdone.  True, the alleged quantum physics used to make the plot possible is almost all nonsensical mumbo jumbo, but that's OK because the wise viewer will inherently be inclined to push the nonsense to the periphery and just run with the story.  Here are a few of the themes that stood out for me:<br /><br />- Life is "nonlinearly sensitive" in the sense that the smallest events can result in an entirely different life trajectory (the well-known "butterfly effect").<br /><br />- Superficial judgments of people often turn out to be completely wrong.<br /><br />- Life can end unexpectedly, so don't squander the time you have.  Make every day count.<br /><br />- Don't forget to tell the people you love that you love them.  Before it's too late ...<br /><br />- There may be some form of afterlife, but it could be quite different than what we imagine.<br /><br />Now do you see why I liked the movie?  Recommended if you're looking for something that has some depth.  In fact, when I finished the movie I thought it deserved four stars, but my further reflection on the movie upgraded it to a solid five stars.</p></body></html>

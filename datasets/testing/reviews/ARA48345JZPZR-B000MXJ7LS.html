That a former Marine would, on-his-own, feel compelled to take himself to ground zero to search for survivors among the smoldering, still-dangerous, ruins that night.  That two first-responders, Port Authority Policeman, would be found by that same Marine (and another self-appointed volunteer) as their survival was nearing failure. That Oliver Stone would make a movie about these two policeman, their ordeal and that of their families, as a microcosm of the terror and tragedy of that day, and do so with reverence and respect.  That his film would be a testament to virtues some of us still prize, those of courage and honor and duty--not only that of John McLoughlin and Willy Jimeno, the trapped policeman, but also of those who dared to go into that burning, unstable and perilous wreckage to bring them out.<br /><br />This film celebrates those simple virtues-courage, honor, duty, family- and I think Oliver Stone believes them important enough that he set aside political opinion to present them in a straightforward manner.  If you believe this is only the stuff of cheap Hollywood theatrics, well, that's sad. Real guts were plentiful on that day and those following, and I believe that was honestly portrayed here in focusing on the miraculous true story of these two men.<br /><br />All the performances are heartfelt and equally good.  I was not bored.  I knew going in that this was a story of survival, but the details were gripping and unbelievable nontheless.  I thought Stone and his production caught the immensity of ground zero in deft touches: the roar of the burning buildings amid the falling debris, the ghastly sound of the impact of bodies, the simple enormity of the structures and the dust and confusion, the look of shocked and stunned people everywhere. It gave a sense of the size of the disaster.  The following story would be difficult to tell, with two of the main leads immoblized in a crushed building, but I thought the editing back and forth from the men to the families worked.<br /><br />Credit to all involved, this was a film I thought I might not like, but I went with it all the way. Nicely done by Stone and company.  And all respect and good wishes to the real men and their families, and to all those who served that day, and serve now.</p></body></html>

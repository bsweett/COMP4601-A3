Undeniably this is a first step on the road to fantasy and romance, but we don't know what public is really targeted, the less than 12, the 12 to 16 or the over 16. That makes the film prudish about the romantic side of things and the hero is not even allowed one farewell hug, not to speak of a kiss, with  the beutiful princess he has saved. At the same time the frightening moments when fear comes from the fast apparition of an enemy or a monster are quick and well timed hence effective, but too quick and maybe too frightening for the younger audience. The main shotcoming is that it is not centered on one field of interest, it is too multifarious. The dragon is good but another more realistic and down to earth animal might increase her, since it is a she, charm and valorize her appeal. Village life and town life are too skimpy and they deserve more precise and accurate depictions. The mountains are OK since they are necessary for the dragon, but yet it would be good to get more details about the citadels at the top of mountains. One vision from afar and entering it as if it were totally open is too easy. Can do better. In the same direction we do not get a real overview of the battle. It looks too messy to be significant. The monsters are also too skimpy. We would like to see them more and be able to penetrate their nature and monstrosity. What's more a little more sentimental content and affection if not passion would be good. Only men seems to hug and women are really out of reach. I have nothing against two boys embracing before getting separated for life, far from it in fact, but it would look more normal if Eragon could hug his princess, and if more occasion to do so among the various characters could be present. This is a first episode of what has to be at least a trilogy. Good for a first attempt. But you have to do better for the next volume to find an audience and also enter a real legend. And please make the clothing of poor people look poor. Eragon was definitely too well dressed before the arriving in the rebel camp for what and who he was. Did he go to Harrod's, or something ? And definitely overdressed. A little bit of skin does not hurt at all, you know.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I WANTED MORE OUT OF THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Doom i have to say was not a bad movie,but there were things that lacked badly in the film..... Doom is about a bunch of marines that have to do a task up in mars at a research building in mars.... While they are there they begin to find mutanted creatures that are out to kill one of them one by one.... The movie had great action and great special effects and needless to say they had the hottie The Rock in it..... I think that this is just a one time movie,but i would recommend this one to watch.....</p></body></html>

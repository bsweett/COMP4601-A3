<meta name="summary" content="Review of the blu ray"></head><body><p>IN BRUGES is a delight of a film and far surpasses any expectations viewers may have.  It is a unique film.  It is not a true comedy, not a true drama and not a true crime caper yet mixes part of all three perfectly to glorious results.  The wit and intelligence in the story and dialogue are an unexpected gift and a rarity in films today.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star as two hit men who are sent to the city of Bruges to stay and await contact from their crime boss Ralph Fiennes.  Also seems that Farrell's character Ray had accidentally shot a young boy in his previous ordered hit and much of the story subtly evolves around all the character's dealings with this act.  All three leads are superb but Colin Farrell is the true star here and shows a deft hand showing his true comedic abilities as he portrays the troubled hit man.  His performance is at times hilarious and sometimes heart wrenching.  He also does the true comedic trick of letting his co-stars also shine while being the true comedic foil.  His multi-dimensional characterization here is a highlight of his career.<br /><br />And the blu ray transfer of this excellent film truly shows all that blu ray has to offer.  Yes, this is an action film but most of it is dialogue driven and not the type of film one might expect to gain so much from blu ray.  But from the picture to the audio this picture shines.  The video transfer rivals the best out there.  Clarity is excellent.  Facial close-ups and the lovely scenery are totally crisp.  Black/white ratio is excellent and colors pop.  Flesh tones are very realistic.  Be it a day or night scene this film excels.  And the DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio adds the needed punch.  Dialogue is always strong and clear and the film has a lovely musical soundtrack that is always in the background.  Surround speakers are utilized to great effect for this.  And when the action sequences come up all speakers are used superbly for a great experience.  And the flow from dialogue to action is seamless.  Everything about the blu ray transfer takes this excellent well crafted film and raises the bar immensely.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The horror classic that revolutionized the genre"></head><body><p>First off I will state that of all the versions of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead on DVD (and there are quite a few), this Millennium Edition is the one to own and has a plethora of extras that long time fans of the film will drool over.  Now onto the film.  George Romero forever revolutionized the horror genre with this chilling story of a group of people barracading themselves inside a house to withstand a horde of re-animated corpses who have a taste for human flesh.  However, what set Night of the Living Dead apart from other horror films (and many other following horror films to feature zombies) is that Romero uses the people trapped in the house as a case study on human nature, and the results prove more chilling than the flesh eating ghouls trying to break in.  Also when watching the film, as one previous reviewer has already stated, the word "zombie" is never mentioned once.  Over the years many films featuring zombies would follow, such as City of the Living Dead, the gore classic Dead Alive, and Dan O'Bannon's homage to this film Return of the Living Dead; and while they were all great in they're own right, the original Night of the Living Dead remains a horror staple and one of the most chilling films of all time.  Also worth checking out is legendary gore/makeup effect master Tom Savini's remake of the film which was released in the 90's.</p></body></html>

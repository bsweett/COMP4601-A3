You've got action and adventure and science fiction and violence and guns and soldiers and military gizmo. Plus, you have a little bit of espionage and alien bad guy and, heck, even an easy-on-the-eyes heroine (ok, it's a minor role, but that's fine by me!). The plot is pretty easy to follow - a bunch of soldiers are sent on a rescue mission in the jungle, but they end up being hunted by some unknown and pretty powerful force. Hey, it's an alien vs. human movie! That's all the plot you need! And it's great fun, especially for Arnold fans. I would like to mention, though, that I bought the DTS version of this DVD. You CANNOT go wrong with this version! The sound is totally outrageously good, so superior to the Dolby Digital surround 5.1 track (also included on the DVD) it's laughable. This is not to say the DD5.1 track is bad, but rather that the DTS track is really THAT good! And given the number of gunfire sequences and explosions in this movie, your speakers will get a lovely workout. So if you want to buy this movie, by all means, get the DTS version and you will not be disappointed!</p></body></html>

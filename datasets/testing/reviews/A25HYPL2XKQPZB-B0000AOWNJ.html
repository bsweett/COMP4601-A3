<meta name="summary" content="A horrible movie..."></head><body><p>I don't like horror movies at all and I actually went to see this at theater.  I know why.  I heard this movie compared to "The Sixth Sense", which was a great movie.  And the premise is great.  "You watch a video tape and a few days later you die."<p>So I wanted to see why.  What was so evil about this tape.  How did these viewers die, and why?  Everything about this movie is good except the ending and the answer to the above questions.  First of all, the Ring is in no way like the Sixth Sense.  At least that movie was consistent, it was a ghost story.  <p>The Ring for the whole movie (except the ending) leads us to believing there is a logical reason why people are dying.  Naomi Watts inspects the tape with high-tech equimpment and follows leads.  I kept hoping she would find the evil killer genius behind it all, but instead the movie reduces itself to some "Freddie Kreuger" type ending.  I was very dissappointed.</p></body></html>

When they awake they find themselves tied down to a chair facing a sadistic maniak who is in a surgery mood. Sofar<br />the film is looking good, but then the director finds it necessary to show all torture scenes in the most explicit way<br />he can think of. If you are really into sadistic violence you will enjoy all kinds of body parts getting chopped of, but if you are not, you may also think that the director should have left a little bit more to the viewer's imagination.<br />Still the movie has a few strong moments....it is a shame the movie is kind of missing its balance. If Quentin Tarantino was truly connected to this movie, he would have noticed this as well. (SARR)</p></body></html>

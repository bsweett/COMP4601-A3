<meta name="summary" content="You can be in a coma and still enjoy this."></head><body><p>I'm not usually a person that likes this kind of movie(s), but i have to admit that they are great fun even though some of the facts couldn't really happen even if this stuff could be true. How can anyone not like Michael J. Fox.  He is the appitimiy of humorious fun and basically a good actor and actually has a very nice stage bio besides.You can be in a coma, or even be brain dead and still enjoy this weird collection of DVDs.  If anything they are worth hearing in 5.1 Stereo Sound and seeing in the proper screen format.  So i have to admit even an old foogy like me can really get off on this set of entertaining films. It's good clean fun for the whole entire family.</p></body></html>

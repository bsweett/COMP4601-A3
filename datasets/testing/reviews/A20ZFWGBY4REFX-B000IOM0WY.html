<meta name="summary" content="The best crime caper that I've seen since "Ocean's Eleven"!!"></head><body><p>Even though I never really seen the original 1969 version of "The Italian Job" with Michael Caine, this explosive 2003 remake is, hands down, the best crime film that I've seen since the 2001 remake of "Ocean's Eleven", especially since "The Italian Job" has suspense at every twist and turn, compelling and daring escapes, and excellent cinematography! The hard-edged direction of F. Gary Gray ("The Negotiator") was nothing short of excellent! The talents of Mark Wahlberg ("Planet of the Apes"), Charlize Theron ("The Devil's Advocate"), Edward Norton ("The Score"), Seth Green (The "Austin Powers" films), Jason Statham ("The Transporter", "Snatch"), Mos Def ("Brown Sugar"), and Donald Sutherland ("A Time to Kill") were top-notch, powerful, and commanding!<p>This remake of the 1969 film focuses on career criminal Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) and his team: computer expert Lyle (Green), wheelman Handsome Rob (Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and inside man Steve (Norton). Along with Charlie's mentor/veteran safecracker John Bridger (Sutherland), the team has successfully pulled off a daring heist at a heavily guarded palazzo in Venice, Italy. The prize: $35 million worth of gold bullion! After a clean getaway, Charlie and the crew experienced a threat that they never saw coming...a double-crosser! As it turns out, Steve just happened to be the double-crosser! And the end result: The death of John Bridger and leaving the rest of the team for dead as well! A year later, Charlie and the team find Steve in Los Angeles and they decide to get some long-awaited revenge, but they couldn't do it alone. This is where John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Theron), comes into the picture. Stella is an expert safecracker with nerves of steel like her father, and the murder of her father provides much of the drive for the conflict of the film. Stella reluctantly joins Charlie and the gang as they come up with a brilliantly smart and devious plan. The plan: To re-steal the gold by tapping into L.A.'s traffic control system and manipulate signals, thus creating one of the biggest traffic jams in L.A.'s history! Also included in the plan is that once they have reclaimed the gold, they can get away in their speedy, but versatile, Mini Cooper automobiles, which are small enough to drive on sidewalks so they can make a clean getaway before the massive traffic jam clears. Like Charlie says in the film, "We'll do it like the Italian Job." Because you see, this isn't about the money. This isn't about payoff. It's about payback!<p>In conclusion, "The Italian Job" has lots of action, harrowing suspense, brilliant stuntwork, lots of surprises, and outstanding performances from a top-notch cast! This is, by far, a DVD must-have to your crime caper collection! If you love movies such as this, then look no further than "The Italian Job"!</p></body></html>

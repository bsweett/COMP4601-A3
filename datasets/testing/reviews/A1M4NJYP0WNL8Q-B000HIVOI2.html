<meta name="summary" content="On a Pyramid Built For Two"></head><body><p>This film managed to appear at just the right time.  Capitalizing on the success of the Star Wars films and The Abyss, and foreshadowing Independence Day, it manages to combine our dreams of instantaneous transmission across galactic space with a whole line of modern myths about the visitations of pyramid building aliens.  Hitting just at the right time, it spawned a successful TV series and lingers in the minds of more than a few avid film geeks.<br /><br />After a quick flashback to an old excavation in Egypt where a gigantic ring like artifact is discovered and then promptly whisked away into secrecy were come to the present and see Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) getting laughed out of an academic conference for insisting that Cheops did not build the great pyramid.  Desolate, Jackson is recruited for a translation job.  Brought to some great subterranean base his challenge is to fine the right set of symbols on that ring, which turns out to be something special - a Stargate.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays Jack O'Neil, a suicidally depressed Special Forces commando who will lead the team (Jackson included) through the Stargate when the combination is finally decoded.  Where they find themselves in a pyramid (no surprise there) on a desert planet where humans labor to mine the metal from which the Stargate was made.  This moment of mutual discovery is interrupted by the arrival of the villains in, sure enough, a giant flying pyramid.  A group of aliens took over human bodies millennia ago and has been living forever ever since.<br /><br />The film is predictable in the extreme - a feel good film with one of those spectacular endings where everything turns out right and the audience yells and whistles with delight.  In other words it's fun, but of the lightweight sort.  Acting is evenly forgettable, but survives having a cast the majority of which talk in an incomprehensible ancient Egyptian dialog.  Jaye Davidson gets a few extra points for making a pretty faced boy look totally evil, but don't look for much in the way of high drama.<br /><br />Still, I liked it then, and I like it now, especially the hokey Egyptian space furniture and animal headed costumes.  It's silliness in a good cause - something to shake a scepter at.  Don't get fooled too much by the 'Ultimate' thing.  You get a feature on Von Daniken, writer of Chariots of the Gods, and a narrative commentary, all easily skippable.</p></body></html>

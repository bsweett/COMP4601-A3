Things take a turn to the darker side when he decides to create the perfect perfume made of the scent of young women...<br />The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of conditions in 18th Century pre-revolutionary France.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his life dream of creating the perfect perfume, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), conditions leading to the French Revolution (1789).<br />The movie portrays superbly life in France, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.<br />We get a feel for the power and influence that the Catholic Church exerts during this time.<br />The film is also excellent in showing the Ancien Regime's methods of execution (Hanging and "The Cross") as opposed to the "revolutionary" guillotine used after 1789.<br />Ben Whishaw, Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows.<br />The setting, the dialogues, the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will provide for an evening's entertainment.<br />Strongly recommended along with Napoleon the TV Miniseries (starring Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich), Queen Margot (Isabelle Adjani), Brotherhood of the Wolf (Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), and Vidocq (Gerard Depardieu) for those with a soft spot for France and/or French History.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Flight, dreams, and the unexpected"></head><body><p>Up was the story of two kids that happened to fall in love with one another, and their love contniued through childhood and into adulthood and beyond. During those years was a lot of happiness and a single want for both of the people involved: they wanted to go on a trip and follow their childhood idol to a waterfall that was placed in a really remote locale. The only problem with this plan was that life kept getting in the way and, ultimately, an old man's love fell ill and vanished from his life. This left him with nothing save memories and a house that the two had built, and even that was being threatened by building springing up all around their home. Then something happened to make the house a monolith that was to be torn down so, in his desperation, the old man turned to the one thing he knew. Balloons. Rigging the house with them, he took the home and saw it go airborne, finally allowing him and his memories the chance that they always wanted. The only problem with that was the stowaway that the old man wasn't expecting and the things he found when he got closer to his dream.<br /><br />Up was not what I expected was was good nonetheless. It was sad, however, and the beginning of the movie touched me and made me wish that the old man would have gotten to do the things he wanted to do when he had his love by his side. you could tell he wanted that as well, and that the house wa smore than a house to him - it was a reflection of the life he had spent with the only person that understood him. As his balloon quest took him on his way, he was forced to choose between this and something he knew was right - and that said a lot on the way things normally play out. On one hand there is the "right" thing to do. On the other is the "things one wants to do."<br /><br />I liked the tale because it took all sorts of things and showed them for what they were. Talking dogs, a person who was not what he was supposed to be, the love of a mother for its children, the hopes of a son as he wants nothing more than recognition from his Dad - all of these things play out and more in such a well-crafted tale. I also liked the fact that the ending was one I did not expect, just as the movie was one I was not expecting. That made me happy and, truthfully, the whole saga touched me and made me feel good about this pick-up.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I would call this a kid's tale, and I say that because of the way it began. It was sad - depressingly so - and I didn't think all of that was what all parents want for their kids. It does have a lot of morality issues it places in front of its viewers, however, and those were interesting to see as they played out before this audience of one. Personally, i liked the story quite a bit and would say that i would be worth watching for children and parents alike. I'm not accustomed to saying that these day, either, but I thought this happened to be true here and recommend this for consumption on all age ranges - provided that parents agree with what is shown in the beginning.</p></body></html>

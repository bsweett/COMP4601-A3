Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't exciting and the plot is a failure of the imagination that did not connect with audiences. Yet again people were let down by mastermind of the Star Wars prequels. And Indiana is an old dog now. Old Baby Boomers like Lucas know how it is not having the energy for adventure and risk taking like they did 40 years ago. Time to settle down professor. So they marry him off to one of his former conquests and make him take care of his basterd, Mutt, played by the undeservedly big role landing Lebuff or however he spells it. Next Indiana will be in a retirement home and sort of rip-off the plot from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LQJMQ">Bubba Ho-Tep (Limited Collector's Edition)</a> and doing commercials like Dennis Hopper before he finally left the spotlight. Harrison Ford looks soo tired.<br />Actually Spielberg had much more to do with the creation of Indiana Jones and of course with the style and creation of the classic first film, Raiders of the Lost Arc, which made Indiana Jones a household name and movie icon. So Lucas gets unfair credit for Indiana Jones. Instead, when thinking of Lucas think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWUWU8">Howard the Duck</a>.<br />A resentful but filthy rich Lucas told Spielberg that people will call them a word that begins with the letter "a" and hate the movie... Now having the ability to predict his own future through his use of the Force the prophecy mostly came to pass.<br /><br />Some indulgent comments: I recall Quintin Tarantino saying directors do not improve with age and you have to think there is something to that. But no, this doesn't apply to the creator of Indiana Jones*. I'm not sure George Luca$ ever had much talent in the first place at this point. He was lucky! Imagine if they'd given him more money and he had better "special effects" technology... those movies weren't the movies Lucas wanted to make and he has repeatedly said so. And his least favorite is...The Empire Strikes Back. And Spielberg..well has he gotten better? I look forward to Spielberg's biopic of Lincoln with the great Daniel Day Lewis playing the part..</p></body></html>

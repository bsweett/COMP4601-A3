<meta name="summary" content="Ok Predator Effects But Garbage of A Movie"></head><body><p>I actually liked the first Alien Vs Predator movie so I thought this one would be just as good boy was I terribly mistaken.  The first thing that threw me off about this movie was when the predator comes to earth to take care of the aliens he is so careful to destroy any evidence of his involvement or he destroys any proof of the aliens or any parts of the ship that crashed on earth.  Now after painstakingly doing that for twenty minutes in the movie the predator kills a deputy(Who is in the forest looking for a lost father and son)and than skins him hoists him in the tree (Like in the first Predator movie)and leaves him to be found by all the other deputies later on.  Another plot hole in the movie was about a female marine who comes back home to her husband and daughter and near the end of the movie she is the only one who can fly the helicopter<br />for the other survivors.  That part made no sense to me was we just assume that since she is a marine she obviously knows how to fly a helicopter straight of the bat never knowing what true skills or training she has as a marine.  Another part is the plot line with the female marine and her daughter it just seemed that the directors and producers were falling back on the scenario of the movie Aliens when the character Ripley finds the young survivor Newt.  The movie just seems to borrow so many similarities and story plots from the previous Alien and predator movies that this just seemed to be pointless there was no true original<br />thought in this movie at all and I mean none at all.  The video and audio are great for this dvd though I give it that and the special affects were<br />very well done as well but for me that was all that the movie truly had to offer.  So I say to sci-fi fans if you want a truly good movie pass this one over if you're just looking for spectacular effects and gory death scenes this would be one to choose but don't expect anything else...</p></body></html>

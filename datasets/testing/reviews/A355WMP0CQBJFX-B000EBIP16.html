<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST OF FANTASY AND MAGIC!!!"></head><body><p>how could anyone give this film a low rate. what?? i don't get it. excellent picture i absolutely loved it. it had a huge dose of magic, tons of fantasy, and a tad bit of reality. this is for both children and adults, and very enjoyable by both. the story is great, the whole setup, the animals, everything was beautiful. their imagination really went out of the roof with this one. it had four young children, a magic wardrobe, talking lion, icy witch, the cutest beavers, and just about any other imaginable animal you can think of. it's good against evil, and the prophecy will be fulfilled. if you have not seen it, it is a must see. this story just makes you want more of it. i expected good, but not great. and this sure greatly exceeded my expectations. it's okay to escape reality every now and then. first there was neverland and now there's narnia. it's movies like this that make you wish these place really exsisted. just a short 135 minute escape from the real world.</p></body></html>

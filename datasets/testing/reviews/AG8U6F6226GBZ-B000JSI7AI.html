There have been many cities that accepted gays. NY, SF, New O., Chicago, and most major cites in the north. Why not go there? If they they were gay why did they marry women?  None of this made sense to me. I remember the 60's and there were gay people who were out, and nobody cared.  I don't think the movie was a true perspective of gay life when these 2 guys got together.  It wasn't until the 80's and HIV came along that homosexuality became a big scare, and with good reason.  But back in the 60s and 70's gays were accepted in many cities.<br /><br />If they wanted to ride around in the mountains, and get married, then they made their choices.  Nobody can have it all.</p></body></html>

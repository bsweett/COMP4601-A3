<meta name="summary" content=""S-M2" blew me away completely!! More action than the first!"></head><body><p>The web slinging superhero is back, and better than ever! Superstar Tobey Maguire ("Seabiscuit") returns as the amazing Spider-Man in the summer's most anticipated sequel, "Spider-Man 2"! About a couple of days ago at the theater, I saw what I expected to be not only one of the best summer sequels since last year's mega hit, "X2: X-Men United", but also a sequel that has more thrilling action and more breathtaking visual effects than its 2002 predecessor. And man, I was not disappointed to say the least! The direction of Sam Raimi ("Army of Darkness"), who helmed directing duties for the first blockbuster, has really outdone himself with his intense direction of this action-packed sequel! The performance of Maguire, returning as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Alfred Molina ("Not Without My Daughter"), playing the villainous Dr. Octopus ("Doc Ock"), was outstanding! Possibly, this is Molina's best villainous performance since Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin performance in the first film! Also returning for "Spider-Man 2" are Kirsten Dunst ("Bring It On"), James Franco ("The Company"), Rosemary Harris ("Sunshine"), and J.K. Simmons ("Hidalgo"), in which they gave flawless performances! Joining the cast are the excellent talents of Donna Murphy ("Star Trek: Insurrection") and Dylan Baker ("Head of State").<br /><br />"Spider-Man 2" takes place 2 years after the events of first film, in which Peter Parker (Maguire), as Spider-Man, defeated the villainous Green Goblin. Things would seem back to normal for Peter, but as the forces of reality take a toll on Peter's everyday life (including declining grades from his college), Peter doesn't seem to have time for anything, including being alienated from his Aunt May (Harris), his best friend Harry Osborn (Franco), who not only has taken over his father's business interests at OsCorp, not only does he still hold a grudge against Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, but is also obsessed with trying to find out the identity of Spider-Man; and trying to declare his love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). Mary Jane is now a model and actress, still pining for Peter's affections but ready to move on when she gets engaged to NASA astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of the Daily Bugle's sleazy editor, J. Jonah Jameson (Simmons), and Peter feels that he might lose her forever. Peter thinks that his double life as Spider-Man is the reason why his life is in shambles, and he feels that he should be Spider-Man...no more. But the worst is yet to come, though. Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), a brilliant, renowned scientist working for OsCorp, has developed not only the formula for fusion but also has a set of four mechanical arms that can keep the gravitational pull and outlashings of the fusion in check. These "smart arms" have a mind of their own and are fused to Octavius' spine, but not to worry, because the arms contain a microchip that keeps them from straying from Octavius' will. A freak lab accident happens as the fusion experiment goes horribly awry, which kills his wife Rosalie (Murphy) in the process, and humiliating Harry. The end result of the accident: his four metal tentacles are grafted onto his skin, thus driving him insane with his power as he unleashes his rage against the city of New York as the super-villain, Dr. Octopus (a.k.a. "Doc Ock"). However, Doc Ock decides to try again with his fusion experiment, only this time with enough fusion power to destroy New York City! Peter feels that his sense of duty as Spider-Man should come back to him as he realizes that only Spider-Man can stop this demented genius, but Doc Ock is only the beginning of Peter's problems. Because not only is Mary Jane caught in the middle of Doc Ock's terror, but Peter's best friend, Harry, enlists Doc Ock's help in order to take down the man Harry feels is responsible for his father's death! So not only will Harry's vengeance present a challenge to Peter, but also Doc Ock will prove to be an even more worthy opponent to Spider-Man. And Spider-Man will have to push his limits to the extreme if he is to survive against Doc Ock's wrath!<br /><br />Like a Snickers candy bar, "Spider-Man 2" really satisfies. What a joy. For fans (like myself) of the first film, the sequel will be an exhilarating ride. Every element of the storytelling is a leap beyond the first film. For one thing, the special effects have gotten better. And as far as the character of Dr. Otto Octavius/Doc Ock goes, Alfred Molina is very human and real as Doc Ock, and his fiendish arms are like individual characters all their own, like four aliens riding his shoulders, snapping their jaws wickedly. But while the action occasionally veers into melodrama, we get a much more complicated and developed sense of all the film's characters. Even Rosemary Harris' Aunt May character has more to do, and her own drama and dilemmas are nicely rounded. This characterization is not at the expense of action, however. The stunts and fights are upped considerably, and a second-act subway showdown is exhilarating (not to mention, one of my favorite "S-M 2" action scenes)! But it is Peter's drama -- getting along in the world, finding love, liking himself -- that stands even higher.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Spider-Man 2" has exactly what a blockbuster sequel should have: mind-blowing action and suspense, some laugh-out-loud humor, mind-blowing special effects, and a powerful, top-notch cast! In fact, just watching "Spider-Man 2" left me with a feeling of going back and watching the first record-breaking predecessor all over again! In a way, the highlight of "Spider-Man 2" is the human story, which best reaches its audience and, in doing so, improves upon otherwise excellent predecessors. "Spider-Man 2" tickles the heart and the brain, suspends considerable disbelief, and does so with commanding flourish -- transcending the genre and succeeding as a great movie in and of itself. "Spider-Man 2", without a doubt, is a DVD must-have when released! And in the end, all I have to say is...bring on "Spider-Man 3"!!</p></body></html>

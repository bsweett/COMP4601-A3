<meta name="summary" content="the hottest puppet sex ive ever seen on screen"></head><body><p>when a political satire manages to piss off both the left and the right, its gotta be doing its job and doing it well. the target of this movie is hypocrisy, and if the susan sarandons of this world dont have enuf self-confidence to be able to appreciate the goofiness of THEIR excesses as well as those of george bush, its more the loss for them. that said, the purposefulness of this low-tech marionette play is a feast for the eyes, and very funny to boot. and if anyone ever creates a better scene of puppet sex, PLEEEZ dont show it to me, lol.</p></body></html>

Altman films tend to be more about character and setting, rather than plot, and he succeeds best when he does manage to squeeze in some kind of plot. He doesn't really manage this here. So, the result is a good set piece, showing the last day in the life of a radio show, and its characters. Altman's films do really allow you to connect with the characters, and this is no exception, so this is a medium hit on that basis. Meryl Streep's here, and so is Lindsay Lohan, so it kind of balances out.</p></body></html>

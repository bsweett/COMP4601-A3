Set amidst the shifting political alliances of the United Nations, it isn't groundbreaking or jarring, but it is thoughtful, partially because these two actors know what to do with a scene when they get a couple decent ones.<br /><br />Kidman is Sylvia Broome, a native of the fictional African nation Matobo, an UN interpreter who overhears an apparent assassination plot of Matobo's leader, Zuwanie, a once-reformer who, not unlike Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, has turned his nation toward a military dictatorship. Sylvia has her reasons for wanting "The Teacher" dead, but here she is, reporting the plot to Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Penn).<br /><br />Keller's assessment? "She's lying," he tells his partner Dot (Catherine Keener). And Sylvia is - about her past, her connections to the Matobian resistance movement, maybe even her own motives.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack, out of the game since the bomb "Random Hearts," allows "The Interpreter" to burn slowly. Keller, conversation by conversation, inches closer to Sylvia, who hides her nationalistic fervor with an idealism that seems like a front until the end, when its ironic source becomes clear, and undergirds the most critical decision of Sylvia's life.<br /><br />In between is the mystery - not all that mysterious - of who, if anyone, wants Zuwanie dead, or maybe just targeted for death. Let it be said that The Teacher's head of security (Jesper Christensen) hangs around the investigation a lot. One of Zuwanie's opponents (Yvan Attal) is assassinated in the movie's opening sequence; the other, wonderfully named Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) is part of movie's most suspenseful sequence aboard a NYC bus. Other scenes stand out: The dictator, Zuwanie, recalling a parade on the George Washington bridge in his honor the last time he visited New York; a quiet moment inside the United Nations, with its comfy earth tones and swooping ceilings.<br /><br />But the chief pleasures are Penn and Kidman. They're A-list stars now, capable of carrying a film on their presence and talent alone.<br /><br />Starting with "Mystic River," Penn tapped into middle-aged weariness with authority; it never would have been said of his early career, but he now embodies "old-school" man like Jeff Bridges does - virile, wise, angry. Kidman seems to play a broad range of characters, but they're all intellectually intense, often emotionally fierce, generally challenging. Kidman pushes her acting somewhat - "spunk" can be the residue of trying a little too hard - but at least it's not a mail-in. Both peel back their personal layers haltingly until they acknowledge they're kindred spirits.<br /><br />Love never develops between Keller and Sylvia, but they merge as angry, romantic souls. Were political futures actually settled by people other than lifetime government employees and the Condi Rices who've spent lifetimes in library basements, you'd prefer this good-intentioned passion.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars</p></body></html>

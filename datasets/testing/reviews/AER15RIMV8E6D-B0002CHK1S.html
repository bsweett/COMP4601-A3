<meta name="summary" content="Some of Carpenter's Best Work!!!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie after seeing the 2011 prequel. John Carpenter did a great job at directing this movie. It has a claustrophobic atmosphere, creepy music, and most importantly the special effects. I absolutely love the gore and creature effects in this movie, they are amazing if you're a gore-hound like me. Picking up exactly where the 2011 prequel left off, the Norwegians are chasing a dog because it's 'the thing' The dog makes it to the American research team and begins to infect and become them. MacReady, played by Kurt Russell becomes the leader and tries to figure out which of his team has become 'the thing' If you love horror, sci-fi, gore, and Carpenter's work, you'll love THE THING!!!</p></body></html>

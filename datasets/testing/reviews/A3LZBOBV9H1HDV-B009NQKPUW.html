This is how the story goes: A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a thrilling journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race.<br /><br />The cast led by Noomi Rapace (as Elizabeth Shaw) & Michael Fassbender (as David) is excellent. The directing by Ridley Scott (who also produced) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Jon Spaihts & Damon Lindelof (who also executive produced) is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Marc Streitenfeld is excellent. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is excellent. The film editing by Pietro Scalia is excellent. The casting by Avy Kaufman & Nina Gold is excellent. The production design by Arthur Max is excellent. The art direction by Alex Cameron, Anthony Caron-Delion, Peter Dorme, Marc Homes (senior art director), Paul Inglis, John King (supervising art director), Adam O'Neill & Karen Wakefield (senior art director) is excellent. The set decoration by Sonja Klaus is excellent. The costume design by Janty Yates is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Rob Inch & Stuart Clark is excellent. The special make-up by Jo Grover & Josh Weston, prosthetic make-up by Valter Casotto, Susie O'Sullivan, Valentina Visintin, &Aacute;slaug Dr&ouml;fn Sigur?ard&oacute;ttir & prosthetic effects supervised by Conor O'Sullivan is excellent. The creature effects coordinated by Katie Newitt & Phill Woodfine & design by Waldo Mason is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Vanessa Armitage (vfx production coordinator), Charise E. Angone, Jignesh Mehta, Brendan Savage, Jack George, Jane Kyung Lee, Issac Lipstadt, Lara Lom, Abigail Mendoza & Matthew Sakata & supervised by Richard Stammers, Everett Burrell, Paul Butterworth, Vincent Cirelli, Trent Claus, Dick Edwards, Charley Henley, Martin Hill & Edson Williams is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent sci-fi film that keeps you thinking and entertained as well. It is also a well-crafted, well-made film that is conceptually different than other sci-fi films of its kind. Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi after 30 years is impressive, another excellent film for him, as well. Noomi Rapace & Michael Fassbender lead a well-rounded cast of characters. This is also one of the best movies of the year and of the summer, so far.</p></body></html>

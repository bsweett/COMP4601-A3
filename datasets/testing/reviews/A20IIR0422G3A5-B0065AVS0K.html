As this particular release of the film to DVD has virtually no extras, I can devote all my space to considering the movie.<br /><br />As a major fan of some both violent and avant-garde movies such as `Zardoz', `La Femme Nikita', `Kill Bill', and `Straw Dogs', my biggest problem with this movie is reconciling the violence with the art of the film. I suspect this issue is as old as the Greek playwrights and their philosophical critics. The most recent issue on this stage was the controversy over Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ'.<br /><br />I think the issue can be stated as a question on the extent to which visceral reaction to illegal violence, sex, sadism, or whatever can outweigh the negative reaction to this social pathology or actually enhance the artistic experience, as the right amount of salt improves the taste of virtually all food.<br /><br />For starters, I believe there are great masses of viewers who will simply be so repulsed by what they consider inappropriate violence. To them, I give a gentle lecture on the Bill of Rights and a copy of the DVD `Hitch' or `The Wedding Date' as an alternative.<br /><br />The landmark movie for establishing the correct aesthetic for violence in film is `Bonnie and Clyde'. Many argued, correctly I believe, when the movie was first released that the more graphic violence and bloodshed enhanced the movie experience not by being titillating, but by revealing the horror of both the gangsters' actions and their demise. This argument has been successfully played out in hundreds of movies, not the least of which was the recent `Saving Private Ryan'.<br /><br />I believe the problem of relating this argument to `Sin City' is confounded by the comic book fantasy style of this film. It is really hard to make any case for the film as an examination of a gangster's impotence or an American army captain's dedication to duty in war when the main characters are plainly cut from a fantastical cloth. No one short of Rasputin survives strangulation on top of gunshot wounds on top of severe angina and lives to the last reel. The other side of the coin may be that the argument that the aesthetic of `Sin City' is classic 1940's film noir taken to its logical conclusion. This may be seen as `The Maltese Falcon' or `The Long Goodbye' as done by Rodriguez and Tarantino, with the part of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett taken by Frank Miller.<br /><br />All this is a rationalization to the fact that the pathological and unrealistic violence in this movie can put off even people who may be disposed to like this kind of movie. Basically, my sense of implausibility of the events in this film outweighed my sense of guilty pleasure from all the violence. `Kill Bill' may have taken me to the brink of that abyss. `Sin City' may have gone that one step too far.<br /><br />But what then explains the good reviews garnered by this film. Does `two thumbs way up' tell me I'm taking on just a little too much old age prudery and that maybe I have to recalibrate my aesthetic sensibilities?<br /><br />I will say that the cinematic artistry in the production of the movie is excellent. All the effects are done to a level which far exceeds that other recent blue screen epic, `Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (aside from having a much better story as well). The only annoyance in the graphic artistry was where in most scenes, blood was seen as a bright red in this black and white world, while in one scene with one victim, all blood was white, not red. Very confusing!<br /><br />Another triumph was from the casting director. With Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and Mickey Rourke and Benicio DelToro, we are just missing Harvey Keitel and Gary Oldman to complete our rogue's gallery of seriously dark heroes and heavies. The appearance of former (`Lord of the Rings') hobbit lead Elijah Wood is a masterstroke of casting against type. I can just imagine Wood's jumping at the chance to play this role.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the sly little graphic Easter eggs such as the makes of the various automobiles, including, I believe, a Chevy Corvair, 1957 Chevy station wagon and the great finned 1959 Cadillac. Also, while the location of `Sin City', named `Basin City' is vague, there is a clear reference to Interstate 287 that runs through some of the most darkly fabled minor cities of New Jersey such as Perth Amboy.<br /><br />The movie is based on three largely unconnected episodes with one of the three serving as a bookend to the other two, opening the movie briefly, to be picked up after running through the other two stories. It is hard to tell where Tarantino's contribution may have come in. My first guess would be as the director of the Bruce Willis bookending story, but I suspect it is more likely he directed and choreographed the scenes in which the female ninja character does her stuff.<br /><br />It is hard to evaluate the acting. There is no question that the male leads, Willis, Rourke, and Clive Owen carry their weight and that the heavies are suitably heavy, but the thin dialogue and the fantastic biology and physics seen in many scenes prevents us from really becoming fully engaged with the characters.<br /><br />The bottom line on this movie is certainly to check your critical baggage at the door and simply fasten your seat belts for an unalloyed thrill ride.</p></body></html>

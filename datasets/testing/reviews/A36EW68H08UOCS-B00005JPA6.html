<meta name="summary" content="A Wondrous Fairy Tale that earn's its R-rating"></head><body><p>Guillermo del Toro knew there is a huge audience for movies that emphasize flash-bang wizardry over substance. He knew he was making a fantasy film with fauns and fairies and secret underground kingdoms, featuring a twelve year old girl as the central character. He knew lots of Americans hate reading so much they wouldn't think about going to a film with subtitles, even though he directed the well-made English language "Hellboy". He knew the amount and intensity of the violence of this film would make it unsuitable for children. Yet he made the film anyway - and thank goodness he did.<br /><br />I see many reviews here complaining that this absolute fantastic movie is "boring" and they had to "read for two hours". Oh my! Pity the poor audience, forced against their will to, dare I say it? Read. So - if you aren't a Spanish speaker and don't want to "read" for two hours, keep on moving.<br /><br />In fact - if you don't want to see a movie filled with thrilling adventure, stunning visuals, evil fascist villains, brave female heroines and beautiful photography with sharp editing - stay far, far away.<br /><br />You still there? Maybe El Laberinto del Fauno is for you. I join the large number of positive reviewers standing in line to sing this film's praises. Yes, Ivana Baquero is an amazing child actor. Not yet a teenager, she reminds me of the sixteen year old Jennifer Connelly in "Labyrinth" twenty years ago. The resemblance of the two young actresses and the name "Labyrinth" aren't the only similarities. Both films are fantasies featuring young women who must complete a "quest" to save their baby brother. But the newer film is superior in every way, for the appropriate audience. Where Labyrinth featured Connelly interacting with David Bowie and an army of Muppets, El Laberinto has young Ivana moving back and forth between an underworld of fairies and fauns and her "real world" of Spanish Fascists. The real world elements of the story make you care very deeply about what happens to young Ofelia and her mother and baby brother.<br /><br />Ofelia's father has been killed in the Spanish Civil War and her desperate mother marries the cruel Vidal, played by Sergi L&oacute;pez, one of Franco's captains, who (as has been written repeatedly) joins the screen's pre-eminent villains. He is cold and cruel to his own family and soldiers. To his enemies, he is far worse. Maribel Verd&uacute;, previously wonderful in "Y Tu Mama Tambien", is strong and compassionate as Mercedes, a servant of the cruel Vidal, but also the sister of one of the Republican Spanish freedom fighters the Captain has been dispatched to snuff out. Ariadna Gil is tragically noble as Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She has married to provide for her family but, realistically, she would like for things to "work out" between the Captain and the rest of the family. Gil's work here reminds me of Allison Janney's in "American Beauty" as a wife beaten down by life with a domineering military man. &Aacute;lex Angulo reminds me of a Spanish Paul Giamatti as a kind Doctor who has been conscripted onto the evil Captain's staff, but like Mercedes, is secretly helping the freedom fighters with his life continuously at risk. Doug Jones gives two of the most memorable performances in the film under heavy makeup as the titular Faun Pan and as the horrible "Pale Man" a flesh-eating beast that Ofelia must retrieve a magic dagger from.<br /><br />My only regret watching this film is my own limitation at not understanding Espanol. I would imagine that this fantastically rich film is even more delicious in its native language.</p></body></html>

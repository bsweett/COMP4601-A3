<meta name="summary" content="In the Sweet By and By...Courtesy of Altman, Keillor and a Game Cast"></head><body><p>There is a ramshackle charm to Robert Altman's 2006 film version of Garrison Keillor's long-running radio program, "A Prairie Home Companion". As he proves time and again, the veteran filmmaker is a master at bringing out the natural qualities of his actors and the complicated tableau of life in his documentary-style scenes. In this case, he leisurely goes back and forth between the show and the backstage complications concocted by Keillor in his original screenplay. The slim plot outline has the radio show cast performing for the last time before a Texas-based corporation shuts them down for good, but Altman and Keillor imbue their movie with such a nostalgic burnish and elegiac grace that it's hard not to be pulled into the fate of the various characters.<br /><br />It also helps that the film was shot at the Fitzgerald Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the two-hour radio program is broadcast live every Saturday night. Quite a stellar ensemble has been bought together by Altman whose reputation obviously precedes him, though not all are used to the best of their abilities. Most prominent of the onstage performers are Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin as the singing Johnson sisters, the sentimental, rather ditsy Yolanda and the more embittered Rhonda. They are convincing as siblings, especially when they talk over each other without hesitation (a funny comedy bit they repeated at this year's Oscars). Even funnier are Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as a pair of singing cowpokes, Lefty and Dusty, who perform ribald campfire songs with Hope-and-Crosby dexterity and even keep in character on the accompanying making-of feature.<br /><br />Kevin Kline seems to be resuscitating his pompous dim bulb from "A Fish Called Wanda" as the theater security chief Guy Noir, though I think he has been unfortunately allowed to belabor his slapstick routines here. Working merely as plot devices, Tommy Lee Jones comes late into the film as the Axeman, the corporate honcho closing the show, while Virginia Madsen plays a Dangerous Woman, a becalming angel of death who walks around the theater relatively unnoticed as she carries out her heaven-sent mission. Both do what they can within the limitations of their roles. SNL's Maya Rudolph plays the pregnant stage manager with efficiency. And except for her very last scene, a contrived plot turn, tabloid teen queen Lindsay Lohan acquits herself reasonably as Yolanda's suicide preoccupied daughter Lola. As the virtual glue that holds all the flimsy plot machinations together, Keillor gets to play his unsentimental true-life self with aplomb.<br /><br />As evocative as the film is, the unwieldy combination of country songs, long-winded stories, quaint commercials and corny jokes can feel pretty redundant over its running time, and one of Altman's chief faults is letting certain scenes run on for too long and with little purpose. However, I'm sure fans of the radio show will be charmed by the results, and the bittersweet ending is a nice Altman-style touch. The DVD has plenty of extras, the best of which is an informative making-of feature lasting about fifty minutes. Through interviews with Altman, Keillor and the principal cast, it helpfully goes into the genesis of not only the movie but the radio show for those of us unfamiliar with it. Not as enlightening is the commentary track by a rather forgetful, eighty-year old Altman assisted by a supportive Kline. There are also extended musical performances and advertisements of which we generally see snippets in the movie, as well as the theatrical trailer and a soundtrack preview.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Football is King in Texas!"></head><body><p>Friday Night Lights gives a good picture of small-town Texas where high school football is the most exciting thing around.  The whole town feels ownership in the team, and people don't hesitate to tell the coaches what to do, and the players, how to do it.  The end result, especially in a town like Odessa, where past successes fuel future aspirations, is a coach and players who are in a constant pressure-cooker.  The movie illustrates the different reactions which individuals have to these pressures.  Billy Bob Thorton, as the coach, is unfailingly polite to the townspeople, even when they track him down outside of Wal-Mart to give him advice.  He cares more about the boys' character than how many games they win, an attitude which is not always popular in Odessa.  His star player is a cocky young man who puts all of his hopes on obtaining a college scholarship and eventually playing in the pros.  When an injury ends this dream, he is shattered.  The quarterback is sincere and hard-working and loves football, but he hates the pressure of winning.  Another of the young players is constantly harrassed by his father who won a state championship and will stand for nothing less from his son.  This is an exciting sports movie which clearly demonstrates the problems with the "win at all costs" mentality.</p></body></html>

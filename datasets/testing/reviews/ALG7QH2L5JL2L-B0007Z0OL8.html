Tray Parker made it explicit it in an interview with 60 Minutes: "Society is our only hope".<br /><br />Indeed. And society consists of human beings, most of whom have a definite element of vulgarity. I wonder if it isn't true to say that _everybody_ has a core of vulgarity, even if it's covered up by the layers upon layers of thin and fragile veneer. American society evidences this vulgarity more openly than many others, though that isn't an indication that it actually _is_ more vulgar than, say, some of those European nations, who consider themselves more 'refined' and 'cultured'.<br /><br />The final speech by the actor 'Gary', in front of an assembly of 'world leaders' captivated by the vapid utterances and platitudes of 'Alec Baldwin' (Parker-and-Stone's satire is without mercy or fear) is a vulgar, graphic and utterly to-the-point summary of the essence of Amercian society, what it stands for and against; on those who stand against it; and on the fundamental substance of the 'War on Terror'.<br /><br />TA:WP not a movie for the faint-hearted, and it has a truly disturbing sequence (and I don't mean the one with the puppets having sex, and at some length) that had the audience dead-silent. But Gary's final verbal show-off against 'Alec', with its extensive and extended use of genital and anal metaphors, was a profoundly patriotic (and screamingly-funny) tirade that surely must go down as one of the most outrageous monologues in film history.<br /><br />[...]</p></body></html>

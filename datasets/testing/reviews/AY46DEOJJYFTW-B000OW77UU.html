<meta name="summary" content="fine film..Will Smith shines..."></head><body><p>Will Smith has acting chops! After the usual hero roles playing mostly himself, Will digs deep to portray a flawed bone density scanner salesman trying to keep his family together. The scanner business is not as profitable as he imagined and after sinking all his money in a venture to sell these machines he's down to his last few machines and last few bucks, the landlord is threatening to kick them out, his wife(Thandie Newton in a finely wired performance) is at the end of her rope, his car is towed away for unpaid parking tickets, his son(played by his real-life son, Jaden Smith is in a daycare center in Chinatown where he mostly watches tv). Can it get any worse? It does. This film does not pull any punches or play it for cheap maudlin sentiment, you take this man's journey and you feel his angst, disappoinment's and eventual joy. When you are down and out and everything is going wrong, hang on and never let go, Chris Gardner's life is an example of what perserverance can pay off. The man is now a multi-millionaire. I loved this movie.</p></body></html>

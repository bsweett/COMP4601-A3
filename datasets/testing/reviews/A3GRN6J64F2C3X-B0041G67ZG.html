<meta name="summary" content="A film that settles for being "good for you" rather than actually "good""></head><body><p>"The Interpreter" is intelligent, well intentioned, and stylish but unfortunately lacks an involving narrative and characters one truly cares about.  Maybe it's shallow of me, but I really think this movie needed a little more "punch" and good old entertainment value.  In the end, the film is watchable and interesting (and its dialogue about human rights issues is certainly honorable) but it could have been a lot more.  Fans of sterile, more intellectual thrillers will likely be more forgiving, but I personally like my thrillers to be more, well... thrilling.  The DVD features a crisp, clean widescreen image and generous extras that flesh out many of the issues discussed in the film.</p></body></html>

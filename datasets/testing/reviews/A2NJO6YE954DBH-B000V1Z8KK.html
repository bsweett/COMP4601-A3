<meta name="summary" content="They framed him for murder and killed his dog.  Boy, are they dead meat"></head><body><p>Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is the best scout-sniper in the U.S. Marine Corps.  On a convert mission in Ethiopia he does his job but things go wrong and his spotter (Lane Garrison) is killed after they are hung out to dry by the shadowy figures running the operation.  Thirty-six months later back in the world Swagger has left the military and lives with his dog on a mountain in Wyoming, minding his own business.  Then Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover) shows up with an offer for an unusual job.  Word is out that somebody is going to kill the President of the United States in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia and Johnson wants Swagger to scope out the scene and tell them exactly how he would do it so that they can stop the assassin.  Swagger does his job, but it turns out to be a set up and once the fatal bullet is fired he is the most wanted man in America.<br /><br />This week I am very much aware that what you think about a movie can depend on what else you have just seen.  I saw "Shooter" on DVD the day after seeing "Live Free or Die Hard" in the theater.  My favorite scene in the new summer blockbuster was the one early on when John McClane has to rescue a computer geek from a hit squad that is shooting apart the kid's apartment.  It was, relatively speaking, one of the most realistic sequences in the film and with that thought fresh in my mind I liked that most of "Shooter" was in a similar vein.  Of course, this is predicated on how realistic you consider kill shots from a mile out to be.  I read somewhere that there was a sniper shot in Iraq that took out the target at three-quarters of a mile, so 1800 yards does not sound like all that much of a stretch to me and not that much to ask in terms of the willing suspension of disbelief.  Besides, if an expert sniper can train an actor like Wahlberg in two days to get hits half the time from 1100 yards out, then I am willing to go along with the ride in this film.<br /><br />In a movie like this a lot of it depends on the other characters besides the hero.  Glover is okay as the man out to get Swagger, Beatty is channeling his role in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNESU8">Network</a>" way back when, and Jack Payne (Elias Koteas) is one of those giggling goons that I doubt would be able to get this gig in the "real" world.  Rade Serbedzija as Michael Sandor has the requisite weight, but few opportunities to really swing it around because his character is subordinated to people who are clearly not his superiors.  Fortunately the good guys are also after Swagger, so he has plenty to contend with here.  I also liked the fact that the FBI were not portrayed as total idiots, and that once things were not adding up the way they thought they started redoing the math, just like Nick Memphis.  I even like the nudge nudge, wink wink near the end that suggested that the government might have its hands tied but that is not true of everybody. Once we get past the rather cartoonish villains, the characters helping out are hero turn out to be a lot more interesting.<br /><br />In this sort of movie there is always the woman the hero turns to in his hour of need.  For "Shooter" that would be Sarah (Kate Mara), the widow of Swagger's spotter, who is literally the one person on earth who would believe a word of what he says.  I liked that this was a woman willing to shoot first and ask questions later.  Sometimes the woman becomes the hero's sidekick, but in this film that role goes to Michael Pena as Nick Memphis, a rookie FBI agent who gets in Swagger's way early on and keeps asking questions when his bosses are telling him to shut up.  He finds somebody to talk to in Agent Alourdes Galindo (Rhona Mitra), but that only serves to make him another person on the bad guys' hit list and forces him to decide which side he wants to be on for the duration.  But the reason I finally decided to round up on this film was because of the the character of Mr. Rate (music legend Levon Helm), a guy who knows everything about government conspiracies and even more about guns.  Swagger pays the old guy a visit in a scene nicely written by Jonathan Lemkin (the screenplay is loosely based on the novel "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553563513">Point of Impact</a>" by Stephen Hunter).<br /><br />So, yes, the whole idea of a conspiracy so big that one guy does not stand a chance going up against it is old hat, but I liked that Whalberg's character just does what he has to do without spouting one-liners and I thought his performance was a lot more compelling here than it was for his Oscar nominated role in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed</a>."  I liked that the film emphasizes the importance of teamwork to a scout-sniper and works that into how things play out.  The hero is a sniper and his solutions almost always have to do with firing a gun, usually a rifle and usually from a long way off.  If this film is nothing more than the Bush-era version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33G4">Rambo</a>," then I found the experience a whole more enjoyable this time around.</p></body></html>

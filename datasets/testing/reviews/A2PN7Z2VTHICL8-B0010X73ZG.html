<meta name="summary" content="Adequate adaptation of King's novella"></head><body><p>After a raging storm that knocks out all power, David Drayton and his young son Billy head into town for supplies.  Along for the ride is neighbor Norton, whom David doesn't normally get along with.  Before leaving home, David and his family wonder about the strange mist hovering over the lake.  Once in town, he discovers the power is out there too, and the checkout lines in the grocery store are long.<br /><br />Then, they notice the mist rolling across the store's parking lot.  They hear screams, and a large earthquake-like thud shakes the store and silences the air raid siren.  A man runs into the store from the mist, informing the people that there's "things" out there.  Now trapped inside the store, the large crowd wonders what to do and who to believe.  Shopper Mrs. Carmody, a crazy lady from town, works the desperate crowd into a frenzy of religious fanaticism.  There ARE things in the mist, tentacles and large bugs and flying daemons, and as Mrs. Carmody preaches the end of the world and expiation via blood, David must find a way to save himself and his son, and the few who follow him.<br /><br />I can't help but compare the movie to the story, which I've read several times and consider it one of King's best stories (before he lost his talent and began writing drool).  In the book, King really captured the crowd mentality when people are shoved together in a tight place.  It didn't work as well in the movie translation.  In my summary of the plot, I tried to stay true to the movie, which in all fairness follows the book quite well until the ending.  I was disappointed in the movie for several reasons.  The director used all unknown actors, no big names to anchor the film.  The acting was rather wooden, and Mrs. Carmody should have been older and fatter (plus I miss the bright yellow pantsuit she wore in the book).  The FX was ok but not spectacular.  The scriptwriter changed the ending, and not for the better.  What this film really needed was a bigger budget to make it work; it's not grisly enough to be 'B' horror, and not performed well enough for mainstream films.  All in all, it turns out to be just a mediocre film that didn't live up to my expectations.  Rent, don't buy.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

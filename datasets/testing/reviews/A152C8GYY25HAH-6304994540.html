I'd estimate that the combined income from all their projects is less than 10% of what "Titanic" made. <p>Nonetheless, one of their productions, "Fargo", made the AFI's Top 100 list. What's more impressive is that voters on the far more democratic Internet Movie DataBase put 4 of their 7 films on the site's Top 250 list. <p>"The Big Lebowski" is one of those four movies. It has the definitive Coen signature, which can be described as the ability to show how ordinary people accidentally find themselves in extraordinary situations. These are usually criminal in nature. <p>In "Blood Simple", there was a dead body that wouldn't stay buried. Unable to have children of their own, a couple - a cop and an ex-con - found a solution when a rich couple had sextuplets in "Raising Arizona". They figured that, if they kidnapped one of the infants, no one would miss it. Frances McDormand, who is Mrs. Joel Coen in real life, stole the show in "Fargo". She played a Minnesota policewoman investigating one of the dumbest crimes ever committed. <p>"The Big Lebowski" is an enormously funny story about mistaken identity, a kidnapping and a missing rug. <p>Jeff Bridges, who's had a very up and down career, gives his best performance since 1993's "Fearless", a highly recommended film. <p>Bridges' character refuses to answer to his last name, Lebowski. Irrevocably stuck in the 70's, he insists on being called The Dude. About the only things he does well are bowling and smoking illegal substances. <p>His best friend, Walter, is trapped in an even worse time frame. He thinks he's still in Vietnam. As Walter, John Goodman gives what is arguably his best screen performance. <p>The real fun begins when Russian thugs burst into The Dude's apartment. Taking a bath in a candle lit bathroom and listening to groovy 70's tunes, our stoned hero doesn't get really mad until the intruders ruin his favorite rug. <p>These villains demand that The Dude's wife repay a lot of money she owes. This presents a problem because The Dude isn't married. Said wife, aptly named Bunny, is married to someone else - The Big Lebowski [David Huddleson], a creepy old man whose daughter Maude is older than Bunny. <p>Maude also becomes a problem. She has her own thugs, despises her father and is convinced Bunny kidnapped herself. As Maude, Julieanne Moore is even better than she was in "Boogie Nights". She also gets to make one of the most memorable entrances in the history of motion pictures. <p>By now you are perhaps thinking that this movie is wacky. If so, you are not only right, but that's just the beginning of the picture. <p>The brothers Coen are relentless inventive and outrageous. In "The Big Lebowski", they even find a way to scold themselves for the profanity that is rampant throughout the movie. Even the foul language seems more satirical than prurient. <p>Joel and Ethan seem to live happily in their own dimension. Personally, I enjoy their distorted view of reality. Or is it really distorted? You decide.</p></body></html>

There's no question that he was an impressive young talent in his early years.  That Sun Record group was a great collection of musicians.  Like just about everybody else, I was impressed with his Folsom Prison album.  I've considered "Folsom Prison Blues" a bold classic of Country Western music.  However, in the years after that stage in his life, I sensed a gradual decline of talent.  In the years before his passing, I thought it a shame than no one took him aside to point out that he'd lost his singing voice.  Some of the later commercials he lent that "singing" voice to were as embarassing as some of the scenes in "Walk the Line".  There's no question, however, that Johnny Cash had a life that was worthy of a major motion picture.  Fortunately, "Walk the Line" was worthy of its' subject.<br /><br />The movie begins with a look at tragedy and dysfunction in Cash's youth.  It does an excellent job of providing illuminating vignettes of his young adult years and his start in music.  Eventually he becomes a star and the fame and fortune becomes too much.  His first marriage is examined with the sort of balance that comes from having his children involved in the production of the movie.  In a dramatic scene of confrontation, Cash tells his first wife "You're not perfect either" after getting an earful of what his faults are.  We know just enough about her to know he's right (and she's right as well).  The emerging relationship with June Carter is the real focus of the movie and that, too, was well developed.  It took a lot of patience, however, with the self-destructive life style Cash was leading.  The concert at Folsom Prison served as the defining point in the movie.  It was a statement that Cash knew he had shared the past of many in his audience and, although he changed his life to avoid their present and future, he made no appologies about the hard lessons he learned.  With all the intenseity this movie contains, I was surprized that the closing scene was the one that impressed me the most.  Kudos to director James Mangold for giving us a glimpse of homelife banality as a way of saying "All is well".</p></body></html>

I had always heard wonderful things about Welles, but I had never really gotten around to delving into his filmography.  The other night I picked up this classic film for the mere fact that Welles was in it, and what I found was one of the tightest film noirs I've ever seen; a film that I'm sure will steadily climb my favorites list for it is seriously one of a kind.<br /><br />The film follows author Holly Martins as he arrives in Vienna after his old friend Harry Lime sends him a plane ticket.  Upon arriving though, Martins receives some disturbing news.  Harry has died, been hit by a car, and is being buried.  Instead of getting on the next plane and returning home, Holly decides that he is going to look into his friends untimely death for he's not so sure it was an accident as so many around him claim it to have been.  Holly struggles with Major Calloway, a British cop convinced that Lime was an unsavory character, not to mention trying to gather information from those who knew Harry, especially his beautiful girlfriend Anna Schmidt.  What Holly uncovers is far more than he expected, and much worse than he could have imagined.<br /><br />Writer Graham Greene and director Carol Reed have crafted a marvelous film noir in `The Third Man', a film that is so superbly constructed it will never leave your mind.  Reed's effective use of lighting and sound is marvelous, and the rich black and white just elevates the mood of the film.  Seriously, I'm beginning to question why we ever moved over to color in the first place.  That zither score is unique and, while at first I didn't think it would work, ultimately it proves to be one of the films greatest facets.<br /><br />The film instantly draws you in to the characters that their situation and manages to keep you guessing and ripe with anticipation as you uncover, along with Holly, the tragic truths behind Lime's fate.<br /><br />Aiding Reed and Graham are the entire cast, Joseph Cotton stepping into the lead role of Holly Martins, and doing a fabulous job at that.  Cotton gives Holly a real sense of spark and determination, proving to the audience the importance within his motivations.  As the film spirals towards its dramatic closing we see the layers stripped away from Holly and are allowed to see his humanity battling itself, which is something I always love to see plaguing my actors.  Alida Valli is drop dead gorgeous as Anna, but she is far more than just window dressing.  She captures the struggle of a woman in love who cannot bear to accept all that her lover really was.  The single shot of her teary eyes is probably my single favorite scene in the film; a beautiful example of Reed using her actors to the full.  Trevor Howard also turns in a grand performance as Major Calloway, a man that is easy to dislike yet the only one you can truly trust.  He understands the true meaning of a supporting role, allowing Cotton to shine brightest yet never allowing his own character to suffer because of it.<br /><br />And then that leads me to Welles, the `third man' from the title.  Welles single-handedly steals this entire film with a mere ten minutes or so of screen time.  When we first see him standing in the shadows (one of the greatest cinematic entrances of all time) we are intrigued, but when his character finally meets Holly face to face we are presented with Welles undeniable presence and ability.  He acts circles around Cotton and delivers a superb, undeniable performance that becomes the highlight of the film.  He is unforgettable in every sense of the word.<br /><br />`The Third Man' truly lives up to the hype surrounding it.  The classic use of shadows throughout creates a vibe of uneasiness that elevates the drama and helps instill in the audience a mystery that is slowly unfolding before them.  When you add to this the immaculate script and the sublime performances you have a film that is not soon forgotten.  I saw this movie for the legend that is Orson Welles, but I kept watching because of everything else that so perfectly creates a marvelous cinematic experience.  There are few movies that come along like this one, movies that cannot be improved upon.</p></body></html>

At least with Romero and his work, I have never seen it get so bleak and down-right depressing that the film is just out of the  realms of entertainment. One thing is very clear Only Romero can do Romero. Somewhere along the line this film lost entertainment value ( In my opinion) and lost a connection with the audience ( I would suspect). I have seen few films that are as utterly bleak as this one, with little or no redeeming qualities, and I am now including it on my list of films that I will not recommend under any circumstances. If you want a film that has a 80s feel ( or at least claims that) and has the brutality of what the CRAZIES aims for ( but fails) , but also has a entertaining and supernatural subplot, then definitely go for MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN ( unrated), since THE CRAZIES has no class, no fun, and no entertainment value.</p></body></html>

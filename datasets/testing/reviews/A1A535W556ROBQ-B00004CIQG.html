Kubrick nailed the Cold War.  The characterizations are spot on.  Peter Sellers has a field day in his multiple roles, with Dr. Strangelove a fantastic parody on the German scientists who came to America to develop the bomb.  General Turgidson made me think of Rumsfeld.  Quick to come up with a snappy reply to any of the questions posed in the War Room as the crisis deepens.  But, the star of the show is Slim Pickens as Major TJ 'King' Kong as he leads the B52 deep into Russian territory determined to find his target.  As Kubrick noted, the scenario was so absurd that humor was the only treatment possible, steering a different course than the novel he loosely based the movie on, Red Alert.</p></body></html>

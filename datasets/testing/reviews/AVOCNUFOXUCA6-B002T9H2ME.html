<meta name="summary" content="Good low-budget outing"></head><body><p>Going into "Moon," I had a preconceived idea of what was going to happen based on the first five minutes.  I thought this would be another paint-by-numbers predictable SF movie, another "Carnival of Souls" in space.  Instead, "Moon" delivers an original movie, with a bit of "Carnival of Souls," "Blade Runner," and even "Outland" thrown in the mix.<br /><br />What really makes the movie is the actors.  In a film where we're stuck in a moonbase with two characters for an hour and forty minutes, the actors had better be good and had better be well-written.  The script, and Rockwell and Spacey, deliver.  The "two-man show" is one of the most difficult bits of drama to pull off, and they manage to do it very well.  In another refreshing turn, the ending is happier and more optimistic than I had expected.  I don't need a happy ending every time, but I also don't need every movie to have a downer 70s German film style ending either.  While this is not a hugely effects-driven movie, most of the effects look great, as if they were part of a much higher-budget movie.  My one geek quibble is that, the entire movie, everything takes place at Earth gravity, which is fine.  To do otherwise would have cost 20 times the money.  But at the very end, all of a sudden there is some lunar gravity reflected in how a person moves around the lunar surface in a spacesuit.  That's no reason to not watch the movie, but it's jarring enough to take you out of the suspension of disbelief and make you think about the gravity and not the movie.<br /><br />The pacing of "Moon" is deliberate, perhaps too much so.  I would have cut 10 minutes or so out in order to get this down to the magic 90 minute mark.  However, "Moon" doesn't go on overly long or wear out its welcome.<br /><br />SF lovers, and probably the population at large, will enjoy at least renting "Moon."</p></body></html>

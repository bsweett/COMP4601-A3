<meta name="summary" content="Immensely Entertaining and Entrancing Turn-of-the-Century Thriller."></head><body><p>Neil Burger has created a rare successful period thriller in "The Illusionist", which he wrote and directed, inspired by Steven Millhauser's short story "Eisenheim the Illusionist".  In Vienna circa 1900, an astonishing illusionist named Eisenheim (Edward Norton) attains such great fame and admiration that his conjuring feats inspire jealousy in Austria's Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). The Prince is determined that no one should possess greater power or cleverness than himself, so he insists that Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) uncover Eisenheim's secrets. What Uhl discovers is more volatile than trade secrets: Eisenheim has renewed a romance with his childhood friend Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), whose expected marriage to Leopold is key to the Prince's political ambitions.<br /><br />While most period thrillers are burdened by their accoutrements, "The Illusionist" is immensely entertaining. And it couldn't look better. The film's deep blacks and rich browns are beautiful compliments to Eisenheim's inscrutable character. Phillip Glass' score is perfection -and as essential a component as the characters and visuals. Edward Norton, Rufus Sewell, and Paul Giamatti, playing three intelligent men with veiled ambitions, create the tension that drives the story. Sewell is particularly memorable as a powerful man frustrated politically and now personally, a consummate rationalist  who sometimes fails to master his own emotions. Prince Leopold is fictional but was evidently inspired by the mysteries surrounding the death of the real Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria.<br /><br />A few weaknesses in the script prevent "The Illusionist" from being a 5-star movie for me: The romance is a bit feeble. The Duchess is too old to be a suitable match for the Crown Prince, as her prime child-bearing years are past. The principle problem in the story that sets Eisenheim scheming and the plot in motion could be resolved by much simpler means. So it's not quite convincing. But these characters are fascinating. The magic is captivating. The production reproduced the conjuring acts by the same methods they would have been performed a century ago, to the extent that it was possible. The great practitioner and historian of the magic arts Ricky Jay consulted on the film. "The Illusionist" is thoroughly enjoyable and bound to inspire awe for magicians past and present.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 2 short interview pieces, a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and an audio commentary. "The Making of The Illusionist" (4 min) features interviews with the cast in which they talk about their characters and the film. "Jessica Biel on The Illusionist" (1 1/2 min) mostly repeats the interview from "The Making of...". The audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger is the best bonus feature. Burger discusses the film's themes of class, power, and uncertain reality, casting, period manners, telling the story from Uhl's point of view, and filming challenges. He also reveals how the magic tricks were done and what enhancements were made for the film. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.</p></body></html>

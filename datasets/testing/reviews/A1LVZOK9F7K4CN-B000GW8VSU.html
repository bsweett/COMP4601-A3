Meryl Steep and Denzel Washington are great, but how can you replace Angela Lansbury and Frank Sinatra?  Jonathan Demme is one of my favorite directors, but lately he's only doing remakes of superior films (he remade Charade as The Trouble with Charlie).<br /><br />That being said, The Manchurian Candidate is about as good a remake as could have been hoped for.  On the downside, we all know the key plot point.  However, the story itself is so good, so timeless, and so TIMELY, that it seems new.  There are several key differences between this version and the original that mark the passage of time.  The character of the Mother need no longer be relegated to a senator's wife - she is a senator herself (thereby completely doing away with the need for the Johnny Iselin [Joe McCarthy] character).  The methods of brainwashing in this film are more sophisticated but, unfortunately, they have done away with the game of solitaire.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest challenge for the filmmakers was the title itself.  In this film, to mark the changing times, it is evil corporations and not communists that are trying to take over America.  The evil corporation is Manchurian Global (get it?).<br /><br />I have to say that some of plot points in the newer version make more sense than the original.  The original Raymond Shaw was just an assassin; there are enough willing assassins in the world, unfortunately - they don't need to brainwash anybody.  In this film, Raymond Shaw IS the Manchurian Candidate.  The good people at Manchurian Global make sure that their time with Ben Marco isn't wasted either.<br /><br />In the end, this is a good movie - another variation on theme.  You can watch it and enjoy it, but it will never replace the original.</p></body></html>

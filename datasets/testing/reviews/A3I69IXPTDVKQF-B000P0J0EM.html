<meta name="summary" content="Superior Magic Drama"></head><body><p>Possibly the best Stephen King movie (although the appallingly underappreciated "The Mangler" might give it a run for its money, but that's in a completely different vein) and one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, including the performances of their lives by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan in the leads plus outstanding support roles from such talents as James Cromwell (the farmer from "Babe" and "Babe: Pig In The City"), Gary Sinise (from "Mission To Mars" and "Forrest Gump") and Graham Greene (from "Dances With Wolves" and "Grey Owl") to name but a few.  The cast has some powerful roles to step into, because of all the King material I've seen or read (I admit I haven't read the original "Green Mile" book but have read most of his other novels and short stories plus seen most of the movies) this has one of the two greatest repertoires of characters: interesting, delved into indepth, most of them immensely likable and even the detestable ones highly interesting and fully-realized.  The only King work that compares in terms of such a multitude of A-list characters is the novel "Black House", co-written with Peter Straub (of course Black House's predecessor "The Talisman" contains arguably the greatest individual character (co-)created by King: Wolf.  Believe it or not though, Duncan's Coffey character here actually mounts a feasible challenge for that distinction).<br /><br />  Set in a prison, a deathrow at that, in - I believe it was the 1930s; somewheres thereabouts - "Green Mile" takes a different course from most prison-oriented movies by focusing not on brutality but on hope and redemption.  That no doubt sounds clich&eacute;, but it's never been more true than it is here, with some of the greatest depictions of compassion, regret and remorse, and the existance of redeeming values in outwardly mean souls.  Of course, there are also examples of some of the scummier examples of the human race here, and as is the case in a number of excellent stories, it's the mix and contrast of the 'bright' and 'dark' elements that give the movie so much of its potency.<br /><br />  Hanks plays the warden of a prison wing (the deathrow wing) set to receive convicted child-killer Coffey, a hulking giant who (thanks to great special effects) must be at least seven feet tall, and who because of his gentle, childlike nature immediately leads Hanks to question whether he could really be responsible for the crimes he was convicted of.  Hanks surprises with his role - the parts calling for the likable, intelligent, gregarious supervisor, it's a no-brainer that he could pull it off; but where circumstances call for the character to come off hard-as-nails tough and dangerous, I would not have known he could pull it off so utterly perfectly.  "Green Mile" really shows parts of his range that he'd never had a chance to show before.  And Michael Clarke Duncan's performance is something that I'm not even going to attempt to describe except to say that it's a high mark in movie history.<br /><br />  If you're a Stephen King fan and have been putting off getting this one just because it's not horror I urge you not to deprive yourself: this is one of his best works regardless of genre.  Or if you're a drama fan and aren't sure if a horror writer will be adept at pulling off this type of material don't worry about that either - that King created this very different tale in addition to such excellent horror as "Carrie" and "The Jaunt" (a particularly terrifying tale in the "Skeleton Crew" anthology) shows his versatility as a writer just like the change of pace for Hanks and several other performers known for different types of roles shows theirs.</p></body></html>

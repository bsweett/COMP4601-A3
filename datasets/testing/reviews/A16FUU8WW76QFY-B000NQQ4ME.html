<meta name="summary" content="The Maya Revealed"></head><body><p>Like any film, artistic license was taken in creating Mel Gibson's epic "Apocalypto" .  However, this one is different.  Gibson somehow succeeded in making and distributing a film that does much more than just entertain.  From the opening scene, the moviegoer is transported to an alien world that most have next to no knowledge of.  The Maya civilization is brought to life, complete with believable characters, incredible costumes and magnificent architecture.<br /><br />It is obvious that Gibson and his production crew did their homework.<br /><br />Archaelogical evidence confirms that the Maya did indeed perform grisly sacrifice on a very large scale, as the film so graphically portrays.  It is also well known that the Maya were more advanced in astronomy than any European civilization of the day; their calendar needed no leap year.<br /><br />"Apocalyto" is no dry historical drama.  It is well written, with fully fleshed characters.  The fact that this film holds the viewer's interest is all the more amazing when one considers the fact that there is not a single word of English in the entire film.  Like many good movies with subtitles, the story is so enthralling that after a time one forgets about the writing at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />In the end, "Apocalypto" is really about devotion to family, and survival against the odds.  The exotic backdrop of the Maya civilization only adds to what is already a great story.  Open minded moviegoers will get a bit of Pre-Columbian history along with some terrific entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Nacho" Not So Funny"></head><body><p>I usually enjoy Jack Black's performances.  I think he's hilarious in flicks like "Shallow Hal" and "School of Rock," but in "Nacho Libre," he tries hard, very hard, to be funny but just falls flat.  Granted, it is funny to watch Black bound around a ring as Nacho Libre trying to raise money for the orphans at his monastery.  It's also funny watching him try to seduce a nun.  But for some odd reason, his comic stylings and those of Jared and Jerusha Hess' writing skills clash at every turn.  Mike White co-wrote the script, but the Hess imprint is solid on this film as they use mundane moments for comic relief.  You probably notice a few similarities between this film and "Napoleon Dynamite."  You should, since both Jared and Jerusha were deeply rooted in that film as director and writers.  "Napoleon Dynamite" was hilarious.  I consider it to be one of the funniest films of the last ten years.  But the humor doesn't translate well in a Mexican setting.<br /><br />As previously stated, Black portrays Nacho Libre, or Ignacio, an orphan raised at the local monastery in Oaxaca, Mexico.  Now an adult, he is in charge of the kitchen and tries his best with the groceries he is allowed to buy in town.  Unfortunately this means that the orphans usually eat beans and chips.  Hoping to gain more funds for food, Nacho teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) and the duo become a very popular tag team in the world of Mexican Luchadors.  His idol is Ramses (a real luchador known as Silver King).  Unfortunately Nacho realizes that he's boyhood hero is also a big jerk.  Things come to a climax when Nacho squares off in the ring with his former idol in order to get a huge payoff that will help buy a bus to haul the orphans on educational trips.  Along the way, Nacho tries unsuccessfully to seduce Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera).<br /><br />As with "Napoleon Dynamite," there is really a lot of heart buried in the primary characters.  It's nice to see such things on the screen these days.  Nacho is very aware of the fact that the orphans look up to him, and when he gets tied up in the glitz and glamour of Lucha, it nearly destroys him inside.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this is a terrible film, it's just not as funny as it could have been.  It's worthy of at least a rental, and many may want to purchase it.  However, I have no plans on putting "Nacho Libre" on my shelf as of right now.  Perhaps when it gets bargain priced, I'll give it another look.</p></body></html>

Knowing nothing of any apprentice, the detectives who've been pursuing the Jigsaw killer since the first chapter in the series are mystified by the continuing killings.<br /><br />  "Saw III" ties elements from its two predecessors in with new ideas and a new direction expertly, creating a movie that enhances both of the films that came before it (which were already excellent).  The ongoing story has become deeper and more multi-faceted while losing nothing of the horror and tension that initially catapulted the concept to greatness.  The new protege abducts a doctor whose own life now depends on her ability to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to see the outcome of the latest, most complex - and most psychologically interesting - of the deathtrap-oriented games.  The character of Jigsaw is explored more deeply in this one - for the first time it feels like his rationale of 'teaching the value of being alive' by bringing the victims who survive so close to death, may actually be something more than a contrived excuse for a psychopath to reign in terror and pain.  For the first time the character, despite the depravity of his actions throughout the series, comes off as being possibly something other than nothing but plain evil, comes off as a twisted but mentally complex individual who may somehow believe his own words, and that his games - in his own warped psyche - have more to them than gratuitous sadism.  He even appears capable of sympathizing with his victims.  This is not a plot roundabout to just take a villain who became immensely popular and 'turn him good', it's part of an an ongoing evolution of what's being revealed about the characters (as of this entry there are now a fair number who have appeared in two or more of the movies).  The characterization of Jigsaw's apprentice is also very developed here, but harder to reference directly without risking spoilers; and the doctor - who despite her dangerous situation seems consumed more by a desire to save her patient regardless of who or what he is - is an excellent addition to the roster of players.  And as for the infamous games themselves, nothing of the shock, nothing of the savagery, nothing of the intensity has been sacrificed to make room for expanded insight into the characters.  Indeed, the twists and revelations - and questions - spinning out of this latest round of the games may be the most gripping of the trilogy.<br /><br />"Saw III" just might be the best of the saga to date; one of 2006's most indispensable horror movies.</p></body></html>

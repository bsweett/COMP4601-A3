Keaton proved all the naysayers, like myself, to be totally in error.  <p>Under  director Burton's able hands, Keaton showed a talent that had been hidden  by his previous comedic roles.  His menacing, yet sarcastic expression was  meant for the part of a character with two distinct identities.  Too bad  that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not reward him  with at least a Best Actor nomination.  This performance is worthy of that  recognition.<p>Jack Nicholson basically plays the Joker as only Nicholson  could!  No more needs to be said. A marvelously haunting score from Danny  Elfman as well as the contributions from Prince make for pleasurable  listening during the film. A pre-Oscar Kim Bassinger is  &quot;eye-candy&quot; in the limited role of Vicki Vale.<p>Finally, the  &quot;look&quot; of Gotham City is both beautiful and grotesque.  This  makes for a truly unique movie.</p></body></html>

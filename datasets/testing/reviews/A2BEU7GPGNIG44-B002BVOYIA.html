<meta name="summary" content="Great bonus material, dramatic, stressfull, yet important film"></head><body><p>"Hotel Rwanda" is an extremely dramatic and important film. Don Cheadle stars in this film as a good, hard working man who wants nothing more than to do a good job and provide for his family.  When their is an assasination of a person of great power the Hutus set out to eliminate all of the Tutsi's off all ages, men and women.  Don Cheadle's character Paul is a native Hutu and his wife Tatiana is a Tutsi.  It's such a stressful movie because Don Cheadle's characters family is faced with near death on several occasions.  Paul doesn't turn his back on the hotel guests.  When chaos breaks out Paul is left in charge and the hotel soon becomes a refuge for orphans and people trying to stay safe from the drama surrounding the hotel.  Nick Nolte stars in the film as a Canadian U.N. worker who does what he can to help the people at the hotel.<br /><br />The bonus features are haunting.  The "real life" Paul and Tatiana appear in the bonus features and even visit a memorial built to remember the people who died during the fighting.<br /><br />The actress who played Sofia, Sophie Okonedo did a really great job in this film.  She was very convincing as a worried wife and mother doing her best to protect her family.</p></body></html>

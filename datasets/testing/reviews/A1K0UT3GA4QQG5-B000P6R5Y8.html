<meta name="summary" content="BAD Disney Movie! SPOILER ALERT"></head><body><p>It is not an innocent Disney-Fantasy. It is a tragedy (tragic play). SPOILER FOLLOWS.<br />There is bullying throughout the movie. Then a teacher dating a student. And to cap it all off a dead leading character girl. It may be a great tragedy-movie.

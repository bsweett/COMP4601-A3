<meta name="summary" content="A NOBLE ATTEMPT BUT NOT EXECUTED IN THE BEST FASHION"></head><body><p>A tale that is rampant in themes of madness.  The main character begins an investigation on an island asylum only to find out that things are more complicated than suspected.  I don't want to give the big moment away so I will just leave it at that.  The "Aha!" moment was done somewhat well but not well enough to get it four stars.  These type of movie focuses are very tough to do, though, so I admire the attempt by director Scorsese and the twenty other billion people who make a movie happen. :)  MY GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: 07/06/2010.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the First"></head><body><p>Anyone who knows me knows how much I loathed the first movie. It was truly wretched. Though this one was surprisingly good. It had better (or just less annoying) characters that you don't want to die (the first movie made the mistake of being populated with awful characters), more inventive death attacks and developed the idea of death having a design more interestingly.<br /><br />Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the only remaining survivor of flight 180 and has now willingly committed herself to a rubber room to escape death's shadow. But lets herself out into the world when learning of a new disaster. A teenager (AJ Cook) on a trip with her pals has a premonition of an incredibly violent freeway pile-up (so more inventive than a distant boom in the sky; the first movie's disaster) and stalls traffic in her lane. Sure enough the pile up happens and all the drivers who she stalled should be dead too. So death begins to stalk them. But no one has any time for the warnings Clear Rivers has to offer and so death offs them in increasing gory fashion.<br /><br />It's cheesy and pure popcorn fun but you'll definitely enjoy it. If only the first one didn't exist then this would be more unique experience. Still, buying this DVD would be cool because the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and the DTS 6.1 sound are incredible. Extras consist of Audio commentary, three documentaries, Deleted/alternate scenes, Infinifilm behind-the-scenes footage, and DVD Rom stuff.</p></body></html>

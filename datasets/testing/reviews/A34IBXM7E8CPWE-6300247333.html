<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad....Just Kind of Pointless"></head><body><p>I wasn't expecting much from the "The Omen", after the recent onslaught of Hollywood horror re-treads like "The Fog", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Hills Have Eyes", I had my expectations set kind of low. To be honest "The Omen" isn't bad. They have updated the story so that we now get references to 9/11, Hurricane Katrina etc. But overall the story is exactly the same as the 1970's version. And while that can be considered a good thing to some, it ultimately makes the new "Omen" worthless. This movie has already been done, and done well. There are some good parts to the remake, like Mia Farrow's character Mrs. Baylock, the decapitation scene was cool, but overall there really wasn't much worth watching this movie for over the original.</p></body></html>

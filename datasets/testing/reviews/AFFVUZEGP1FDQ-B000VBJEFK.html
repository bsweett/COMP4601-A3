The story was rather slow and had way to many "messages". The "don't steal" message had me rolling my eyes every single of the 10000 times it was mentioned. It was an obvious way to build up to the climax of the story. And really, G rated? There is a woman, with a gun, wrestling with a man for said gun and then they make up; the kissing scene - you can see their tongues moving inside their cheeks and there is the full body checkout by Linguini...ok....oh well. The story dragged on too much, it was boring...but the animation was excellent.</p></body></html>

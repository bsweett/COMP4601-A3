<meta name="summary" content="Sorry...but I was not amused"></head><body><p>As much as I want to jump on the bangwagon and praise how clever this movie is and wow look how they poke fun of all the action/thriller sterotypes...but I'm not too aware of many action thriller with gay private eyes and mumbling narrators.  Silly me, I was actually trying to make sense of the story I was watching...which truley turned out to be a waste of time.  Why?  Because the movie audience has no idea about this mystery crimer writer that everyone in this movie holds in such high regard.  And when the whole story unfolds-it does absolutely nothing for me.  Downey and Monaghan have absolutely no chemistry.  And Gay Perry made no sense to me-unless he was just there to solely feed the audience the plot.  I laughed maybe once and then afterward forgot the joke I found amusing.  Overall, it might be up your alley...it just wasn't up mine.</p></body></html>

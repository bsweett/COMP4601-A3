I believe if some is gay deep inside they cannot pretend to be somebody else.  Pretending to be someone else is more harmful than helpful, and they end up suffering more.  Society is still scared to death of people who are "too different."  What a powerful lesson this film teaches.  Even Dora should understand that her so called Christian moralizing does not match up with the truth exuding from this award winning film.  Until human beings are able to understand people who are different rather than hurting them, we are still running in place.  We have a ways to go.<br /><br />It's all about tolerance the Golden Rule...treat others like you would like to be treated.  You should know this if you are a 5th grader or a senior citizen.  The ethic of reciprocity (or the Golden Rule) is a general moral principle found in virtually all religions and culture, often as a fundamental rule, a fact which suggests that it may be related to innate aspects of human nature (see altruism). It is most commonly rendered as "do unto others as you would have them do unto you", or in other words "treat others as you want to be treated".<br /><br />In most formulations it takes a passive form, as expressed by the Jewish sage Hillel: "What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man."<br />In Western culture, however, the most famous formulation is active, as expressed in the Torah as "love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).<br />This traditional guiding rule was (and is) so highly valued that it has for centuries been known in English as the "Golden Rule".<br /><br />Congrats on those who had the guts and integrity to make this picture.  I hope it starts and long and healthy dialogue about tolerance and love.  This country needs good political dialogues so desperately.  We need more respect for each others' humanity.</p></body></html>

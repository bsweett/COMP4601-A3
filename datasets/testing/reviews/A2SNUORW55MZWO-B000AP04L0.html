<meta name="summary" content="What Would You Do If You Had A Million Dollars?"></head><body><p>Well, this movie is just as good as a million dollars to me. If you don't love this movie you don't have a funny bone in your body. This movie is just as funny to me today as it was the first time I saw it. Hundreds of viewings haven't watered it down as has happened for me with other films such as Half Baked. No... this is the real deal. Every character is great, every scene is hilarious. This is a perfect movie and I don't think it can ever be topped. 20 years from now I will still be quoting lines from this movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, where have you been? Oh, you simply have to own this movie.</p></body></html>

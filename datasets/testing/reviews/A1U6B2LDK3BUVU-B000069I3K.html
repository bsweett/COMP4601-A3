I've been watching a lot of the most famous movies of all time, and few of them hold up like this does.  It is one of the few that merits a five star rating.<br /><br />Elliott, and Drew Barrymore, put on great performances as children.  I can't remember when I've seen such good acting from little kids.<br /><br />It's a very emotional and warm and fuzzy film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Helen Mirren, Helen Mirren (Nead I say more?)"></head><body><p>There is one main reason to see this film: HELEN MIRREN! She's fabulous! I missed it in the theaters but it plays beautifully on a home screen - even my 27 inch one. The wide screen is not as wide as many others and so the picture shows up well.<br /><br />Especially for baby boomers who remember watching the young Elizabeth being crowed Queen on a small black and white TV set in the early 1950s, this film shows us the mature and intelligent and yet cold looking monarch that she is. As we learn in the short 17-minute "making of" documentary, it was not Direct Frears concern that the actors playing Tony Blair and Prince Charles actually look or sound like the real characters. At first you miss Charles large ears but pretty soon you hear what is a good characterization of his voice.<br /><br />On the surface this is a story of the tragic death of Princess Diana but, below that surface is the story of what it is like to be raised in a Palace and be cut off from the modern world.<br /><br />There are two commentary tracks as well. One is by Direct Stephen Frears and talks about the making of the film. The other is by a British Historian who discusses the making of a Monarchy and Royal customs.<br /><br />Most of all, however you will remember the great performance of Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br /><br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

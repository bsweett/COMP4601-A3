<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding!"></head><body><p>Brothers Andy (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke) are in desperate need of money and come up with a fool-proof way to get it:  They'll rob a small jewelry store.  The catch:  It's their parents' store.<br /><br />Wow.  I'll say it again:  Wow.  This movie is the most powerful and exciting film I've seen in a long time.  The acting is outstanding, the script is clever and full of surprises, and the direction by Sidney Lumet is superb.  Supporting the two stars are Albert Finney as their father and Marissa Tomei as Andy's wife; they are both excellent.  The story reminded me a lot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305417830">A Simple Plan</a> which also had two greedy brothers with a can't-miss scheme that quickly and tragically becomes a nightmare.  This movie is so intense, I was often saying, "Yikes!" to myself and holding my breath a lot.  It's that good.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is the way the story constantly goes back and forth in flashbacks; I don't think that added anything and it was a bit frustrating for me.  But I still recommend it:  If you like emotional crime thrillers, you'll love this movie.  Explicit sexuality, violence, and profanity.</p></body></html>

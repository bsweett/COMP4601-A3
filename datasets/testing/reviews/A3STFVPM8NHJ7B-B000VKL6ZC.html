It took me about three minutes until I changed my mind. Rob Zombie set the story straight and I like how he was very honest about this movie. Its a very good movie if your not looking for a complete scene to scene remake of the original. Thanks to Rob Zombie for that comment. I still hate things about the movie but i'd give it four stars anyways. Its Zombie's idea and vision and I respect that. His commentary on the dvd is very well done. Ive heard him do it before on anther one of his movies. He is very well spoken and gives good insight to his vision and movie. I cant wait for his next movie and I wonder what horror classic they'll make remake next. Great movie, four out of five stars.</p></body></html>

It starts out perfectly, with John Houseman (as an old salt) telling the tale of how the "Elizabeth Dane" sank off "Spivey Point", drowning all aboard. He tells this story to a group of kids at exactly 11:55 pm (you'll understand why this is significant when you see it). This is a classic intro to a classic chiller! Adrienne Barbeau stars as disc jockey / KAB radio owner "Stevie Wayne", broadcasting from  her lighthouse radio station. Jamie Lee (Halloween) Curtis is Beth, a hitchhiker on her way to Vancouver. Hal Holbrook is the Priest of the local church. He uncovers (more like it almost drops in his lap) a terrible secret about his grandfather; a secret involving conspiracy and murder. A murder plot that results in the founding of the town. A curse is being fulfilled this night, the one hundred year anniversary of the small town. There's something in the fog. It moves against the wind and seems to glow. Just what IS it?? This is a scary flick! I've seen it many times and still jump and squirm in spots! Watch it with Halloween on a cold, dark night. You'll chew your nails to nubs! The music is great as well. Carpenter has a way with simple, repetative, yet creepy as hell sounds. Lock your doors. Bolt your windows. And whatever you do, DON'T GO OUT IN THE FOG...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Fascinating film that shouldn't be pass up"></head><body><p>MONSTER is not a happy film. It's one of those movies that leave you dead at the end.<br /><br />If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this film, it's Theron's. For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, beautiful women. Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly. This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing. She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some great acting. Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby is equally remarkable, conveying childlike naivety, seductiveness, stubbornness and growing manipulative ness very well. They both dominate the film. The supporting performances did fine as well. I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern. His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen. While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.<br /><br />The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life. What Aileen did was reprehensible. The violence is not glorified--it's bloody and sick. What's so fascinating (and scary) about this film is that I actually began to sympathize with Wuornos! While I could never condone her actions you can see clearly what led her to it. This is a rare film--it makes a serial killer look sympathetic. What she did was evil, and she had to pay for that. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable. But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.<br /><br />MONSTER is a well-made film that's not for the weak of heart. It's also engaging, engrossing, and realistic. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. You won't learn too much about how Aileen Wournos turned into the person she did. Even the narrative itself is a little confusing at time, so that you can't be sure where Lee and Selby are at given moments. But it's Hollywood professionalism at one of its rare high points. It's made by a professional team for mature adults.</p></body></html>

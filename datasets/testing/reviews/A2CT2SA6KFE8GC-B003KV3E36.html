It's been so long since a decent action film came out of the mainstream that this film is a total gut punch.  It more or less slipped in and out of theaters rather quickly and undetected.  A shame, but at the same time the film had zero hype attached to it, making it a more pleasant surprise.  Of course the critics panned this movie big time upon it's release for being too brutal and violent and short on plot.  I guess they forgot they were reviewing a Rambo movie.  But the reasons the critics hated this movie will most likely be the reasons action fans will love it.<br />Stallone wanted to bring the genocide in Burma to the people's attention considering it really doesn't get any news coverage at all.  In the film's intro we're shown some rather graphic and unpleasant newsreel type footage of actual atrocities in Burma.  Stallone tries to simulate this kind of brutality throughout the film.  Though Stallone has a bit of a message he's trying to get across, and we as the viewers do actually become more enlightened about what's going on in Burma, in the end we don't watch action films to be educated.  We want to see Rambo turning schmucks into pulled pork....and that's just what he does here.  Rambo is now an old and grumpy man with a chip on his shoulder who has long since flipped the bird to the rest of the world(and who can blame him after all we've seen him go through?).  His peaceful yet scarred life on the Burmese border is thrown all out of whack when some missionaries want him to escort them into Burma by boat.  After helping out and returning home only to find the missionaries have been captured, it's time to get his hands dirty once again.  This time he's not acting solo, he has the help of a group of mercenaries.<br />Those expecting a good chuckle at seeing an aging Rambo take on an army might be a bit surprised.  The tone of this film is grim, brutal and violent.  Rambo's not cracking any cute one liners, nor is he trying to impress us with his pecs(he spends the entire film in a shirt).  Rambo is old, mean, pissed off and kicking some serious ass.  The guy's so hardcore that he charges into battle with nothing but a bow and a homemade machete!  It may sound unrealistic(which it is) and a bit silly, but it works!  I think it's do to Stallone's directing.  The man does a breathtaking job of shooting action scenes.  The onscreen carnage is downright vicious and shocking.  Try thinking of the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan and you'll have a good idea.  Stallone must have been inspired by his son, Sage, coz the movie is bloody as hell.  An early attack on a Burmese village shows children shot and stomped to death, all in unflinching detail.  When Rambo gets his hands on a gun(and even before that) people are exploding into geysers of blood and body parts.  I'm surprised the MPAA passed this with an R rating!  Apparently Stallone is surprised by that as well.  He got away with it by convincing the censors that the depiction of violence was necessary to show the horrors of war.  I'm sure this is true, but I can't help but think he's chuckling to himself at the victory.<br />I give this the highest recommendation, no doubt about it.  Though it does seem to have a point to get across, in the end it is a mindless action movie at heart.  And us Rambo fans wouldn't have it any other way.  Thank you so much, Mr. Stallone, for putting the balls back into the action film.</p></body></html>

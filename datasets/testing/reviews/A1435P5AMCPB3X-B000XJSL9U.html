Bruce Willis brings back his classic NYPD police officer character John Mclain, who has a hero chip on his shoulder.  His family is in shatters, he's all alone, and low and behold, he gets the off duty call that he can't say no to, and is drug into a non-stop rollercoaster from there.  The action is non-stop, solid storyline, bit streached for how much damage one human body can take without dying.  Excellent film to pass time with.  Must see for any Bruce Willis, Die Hard fan.</p></body></html>

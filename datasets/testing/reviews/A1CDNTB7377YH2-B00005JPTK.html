<meta name="summary" content="Better than the Book and Prior Movies!"></head><body><p>The special effects of this movie are amazing and Will Smith puts in the performance of his career as Robert Nevell, a survivor of a virus who drives around Manhattan shooting at deer and visiting the video store by day.  At night, he and his dog are locked in their apartment while crazed creatures (a la Dawn of the Dead) run amok outside.<br /><br />The movie never gets boring and there are several bone chilling scarry parts.  Smith takes Nevell's character way beyond Matheson's novelette and surely beyond Vincent Price's or Charleton Heston's earlier renditions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A DVD review"></head><body><p>A very good DVD production of the movie. The &quot;Lost in Space&quot; feature was interesting although short. The deleted scenes are very funny and I think a lot of them should have been retained in the first cut. The  deleted scenes also help explain some of the incongruities, such as why  Sigourney Weaver suddenly is showing a lot of cleavage toward the end of  the film.</p></body></html>

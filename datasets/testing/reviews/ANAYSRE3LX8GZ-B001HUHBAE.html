<meta name="summary" content="I have reason to rate this 2."></head><body><p>I can only give this film 2 stars now for it being over 2 hours and being made in a way where it is building up to a big climax and then all of a sudden it has cut to 20 years in the future to text I could not even read about what happened.<br /><br />I did not know this thing was based on a true story, however, it is clear in the end that it is because no one in there right mind would end a film this way. It introduces characters that just disappear and what the heck is the point of character building and being captivated and sucked into there plot to uncover a murderer when it just leaves things unresolved in the end with no climax.<br /><br />Ok, so it's based on a true story... so they would not make a fictional ending... it either would have been better to have had some kind of finale they made up and just said it was BASED on a true story, or they should have skipped getting so involved with the characters in this, the movie up until the end was pretty good, i did like it, I'm just really disappointed that the end of the movie went no where. And I could not read the story it had printed up as it's ending. Who picked that font and size?<br /><br />So there is a directors cut coming out... i don't think i will bother with it, I like a movie that has a beginning a middle and an end, not one that goes for 3 hours and then suddenly stops leaving every thing you are waiting to see explained or discovered to come together.<br /><br />Interesting story, but I can only see this working when either reading about it or watching it as a documentary or something, not a finale-less feature film.</p></body></html>

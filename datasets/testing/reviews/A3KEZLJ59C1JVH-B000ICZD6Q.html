<meta name="summary" content="This film will keep you in "good company!""></head><body><p>"In Good Company" completely blew me away.  Dennis Quaid stars as Dan Foreman, a middle-aged advertising executive at the peak of his career who suddenly finds himself demoted to a lower position when his company is taken over by a large corporation.  To make matters worse, Dan's new boss, Carter Duryea (played by Topher Grace), is young enough to be his son, making for an extremely tense working environment.  When Carter starts dating Dan's college-aged daughter (Scarlett Johansson), things get even more complicated.<br /><br />This film tackles a subject that has unfortunately hit close to home for many Americans these past few years: the fear of losing your job.  We see many characters facing sudden unemployment and the struggle of trying to make ends meet.  The issue of maintaining personal and professional relationships is also explored in the movie, and the cast does an amazing job with this touching and witty script.<br /><br />"In Good Company" is slightly more bittersweet than the television trailers have made it out to be, but there are many amusing moments peppered in among the more serious scenes.  (Carter's first ride in his Porche and Dan's birthday party entrance are two especially hilarious moments that pop into mind.)<br /><br />Overall, this movie was incredible.  It's the kind of movie that you'll want to watch again and again.  I think everyone should make the effort to see this film.</p></body></html>

I bought this DVD movie because it also stars Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Shea Whigham, Lindsay Lohan, Electra Avellan, Tom Savini, and Alicia Rachel Marek.  Well that, and it being rated "R" I was hoping for some actresses who make up for not being much else but visual effect.<br />This is a hilarious, over done, cult classic, campy, poorly acted, poorly directed, and extremely lame masterpiece that doesn't need substance to be more than well worth your time and money.  I busted up laughing out loud at this several times and got everything I was hoping for in every category by watching this film.  The hokey FX, the blood and guts, the fleshfest buffet, and I don't want to spoil the movie for you entirely but you'll have to crack up laughing when Danny Trejo uses a very special "rope" to jump out a window and swing back, crashing into the window below.  The corny dialogue along with the low-budget style sets and directing make this movie absolutely a keeper.  After watching a few movies not worth watching that I regret owning and intend to trade in, it is a breath of fresh air to have my own copy of "Machete" so I can view this trophy over and over.<br />I recommend "Machete" as a cure for the doldrums, and encourage anybody who needs a good laugh to view this as soon as you get a chance.  Five stars.  So bad it's great fun.  It is altogether obvious the cast had a great time making this film.</p></body></html>

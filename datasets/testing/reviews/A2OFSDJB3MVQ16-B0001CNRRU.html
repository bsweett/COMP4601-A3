<meta name="summary" content="Alejandro's follow up to "Amores Perros""></head><body><p>I'm hard put whether to give this alternately depressing and enlightening film a 3 or 4 star rating, but closer to a 4 since the three leads are superb and this film has more substance than a lot of the films currently out there. In a nutshell, it tells of 3 people interlinked to a tragedy involving a car crash (in narrative, very similiar to the director's first, "Amores Perros") and how they eventually finally confront each other in an dynamic finale.  Sean Penn must have had a great year, acting-wise, since this film and "Mystic River" netted him an Academy Award, a Golden Globes, and Best Actor by the National Board of Review (a poll by all the leading film critics in the country). Watts and del Toro are also superb in their pivotal roles and the title itself refers to the weight applied to one's life when it begins!!</p></body></html>

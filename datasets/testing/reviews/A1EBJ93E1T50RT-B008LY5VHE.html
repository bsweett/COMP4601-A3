<meta name="summary" content="Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain"></head><body><p>This review is not a critique of Universal's questionable DVD marketing strategies.  I only bought this summer's "Special Collector's 5th Anniversary Edition of the Last DVD Release" version of "Jaws" because... well, five years ago, I bought the 25th anniversary edition of "Jaws" on VHS.<br /><br />*crickets chirp*<br /><br />At any rate, having previously seen most of the specials features on this set courtesy of the electronic miracle of the video cassette player, I didn't spend a lot of time on the added extras.  I bought "Jaws" on DVD because it's "Jaws".  On DVD.  And I didn't have it before.  True, I'd have preferred some sort of text trivia track, or a cast and production crew commentary, even if Spielberg wasn't going to contribute.  Surely there were some audio interviews with Robert Shaw that could have been located and incorporated?<br /><br />The movie itself remains one of my enduring favorites, even though I discovered it relatively late, through repeat airings on Turner basic cable in the mid to late '90s.  "Jaws" is atypical for a blockbuster in that the second half of the movie is basically a stage play with a cast of two scenery-chewing masters, a mechanical shark, and Roy Scheider.  Witness (several times) the nine-minute sequence set in the cabin of the Orca, which begins with Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw comparing scars... then transitions to Shaw's captivating speech about the U.S.S. Indianapolis (which he reportedly wrote himself)... followed by a slightly drunken sing-along... interrupted by a shark attack in mid-chorus.  Spielberg was only 26 when he filmed this, and it's easy to see why he stuck around.<br /><br />The first half of the movie has almost no relation to the last, but even in different tempo, Spielberg captures the bucolic intensity of Amity Island with a master's attention to detail.  In any other film, Murray Hamilton would have stolen the show as the earnest, buffoonish, soon-to-be-deflated mayor who insists on keeping the beach open even after two people are dead.  And even in the midst of the comic actions of the islanders, Spielberg still pushes Ben Gardner's disembodied head through a boat hull when the audience least expected it (and repeated the trick 20 years later with Samuel L. Jackson's arm in "Jurassic Park").<br /><br />While Lorraine Gary is given a bit of a thankless role, and drops out of the movie halfway through, it's amazing that she had time to make an impression at all, what with Shaw and Dreyfuss trying to outdo each other in every scene -- both successfully.  And even though the nominal hero, Roy Scheider, seems to be lagging 15 seconds behind Shaw and Dreyfuss (watch the cabin sequence again and see how passive he makes Chief Brody), he still saves the day when Shaw's working-class fisherman act and Dreyfuss's hi-tech gadgetry both fail to stop the great white.<br /><br />It's great to see "Jaws" still kicking hard 30 years later, in the way that "War of the Worlds" probably won't do in 2035.  From the recent "MythBusters" special on "Jaws", which even took time to debunk the deleted scene with Shaw buying piano wire... to Bryan Singer's effortless rehabilitation of Scheider's nonsense line, "That's some bad hat, Harry", I would find myself watching "Jaws" on DVD even if the Special Edition had nothing on it but the movie.<br /><br />Even so, put together that audio commentary so I can buy the Commemorative 5th Anniversary Edition of this current release in 2010.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Man CAN Fly"></head><body><p>With the exception of George Reeves from the television series, no one has ever cleary defined a role as greatly as Christopher Reeve (for four films no less)! Until Burton's Batman film 11 years later and more recently The Dark Knight, there has never been an epic superhero film like this. It combines great talent (in front and behind the cameras), great story (with very subtle Biblical references) and amazing special effects. The only aspect of Reeve I don't like (and its probably because of the way the writers wanted) is the portrayal of Clark Kent. I don't like that he portrays him as a bumbling fool. As Superman, he's sincere and honest but the recent animated versions and Reeves' portrayed him as a reporter who can get story and not get intimidated by criminals as easily as these movies (including Returns). Margot Kidder is feisty as Lois Lane (and believeable too, not like Bosworth who looks like she's at the Daily Planet on an internship). Gene Hackman is both lethal and funny as Luthor, able to mix the cruelness of the villain along with the wittiness in his insults to his underlings. The flying sequences are brilliantly done (and continue to get better, until 4 (they liked to use the same shot over and over) and Returns (where almost everything looks CGI, even in the shots that really are Routh, he looks computer generated). The incomprable John Williams again delivers a rousing score. His main theme and the love theme are ones not to be missed.</p></body></html>

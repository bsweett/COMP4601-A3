<meta name="summary" content="Middle-School Humor For The Masses."></head><body><p>Last night's DVD movie came out of our storage rack. My wife probably bought it and we probably watched it about 6 years or so ago. It's an easy-to-forget movie and I forgot and watched it again. Unfortunately. "Meet the (Sorry, mentioning the name gets my review dropped)" would seem to have a lot going for it. The cast consists of mega-stars. The production values are high. The music is by Randy Newman. This thing should be a smashing success. Well, perhaps it was at the boxoffice, but as a home movie it's one of the lamest comedies I've watched in the last decade.<br /><br />The story involve a man and his fiancee, together with her parents, as they go together to meet his parents in a trip by motorhome. The man's last name is unfortunate hence they go to meet the parents and relatives as the name of the movie says. Get it?  Well, believe me, as a comedy it's all downhill from here. The basis problem is, of course, it just isn't funny. The name grows wearisome after the second use, and wait, there's another 50 times or so. Those with a middle-school- level humor will get a lot of laughs. Using the name in this review has gotten me in censor problems twice so far in submitting this review and I don't consider it a bit funny, the name or the censorship. Anyway, I guess other people do, at least the name. The supposed jokes among the two families and their meetings are embarrassing, not funny. None of the acting generates a feeling of fun and belonging. Even the pets aren't funny, although they come the closest. I sat in disbelief as this non-funny comedy slowly unfolded. It seemed overly long and I thought it would never end. Well, what can I say? I suppose in every great star's list of movies, there's a few turkeys and this is one of them for quite a few people. Hoffman and Streisand, in particular, must be embarrassed to be credited with this bomb.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

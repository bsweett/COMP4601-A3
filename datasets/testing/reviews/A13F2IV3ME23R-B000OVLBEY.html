<meta name="summary" content="BOO HOO TO THE FEW ??????"></head><body><p>Excellent movie all the way around although I prefer the Sons of the Pioneer's rendition of "Ghost Riders in the Sky".<br /><br />Would have bought it no matter who got the lead role - Cage just added a bit more class.<br /><br />Eve still had her body exploited in the clothing. Glad she [as her character] walked away.<br /><br />Fabulous renditions of the Rider's bike - really enjoyed the featurettes and the commentaries - they covered more of the story plot and the characters than the strict technicalities.<br />Enjoyed seeing the natural exchanges between the actors in the special features.<br /><br />Love Sam Elliott - he was made for his part.  New that voice before ever he showed up.  What a man! Presence, charisma, sexy voice.<br /><br />This movie just makes the comic characters more real - Am glad I collected some of them.<br /><br />These comic book character renditions in movies just keep getting better.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - DEFINITELY A KEEPER.</p></body></html>

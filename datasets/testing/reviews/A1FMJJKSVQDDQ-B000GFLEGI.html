<meta name="summary" content="Romero's weakest"></head><body><p>I'm not into the zombie craze, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Return of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead (both the original and the remake), and Shaun of the Dead are always great to watch straight through. Land of the Dead, not so much. Boy, was I disappointed by George A. Romero's latest work. There is plenty of good ol' zombie gore, but that's the only interesting aspect of the entire production. In my opinion, this has to be the weakest zombie movie by the grandmaster of all zombie flicks. The political undertones are really out of place in the midst of all the blood and guts. The characters are not interesting enough for me to care about (except Charlie and Cholo). The music was pretty good, but not very memorable. I did like the cinematography, as well as the gore (congratulations to the makeup department). In the end, I guess I didn't really hate the film, but I didn't like it, either. Land of the Dead is one that I didn't really enjoy watching, but thankfully it isn't really that terrible.<br /><br />Grade: D+</p></body></html>

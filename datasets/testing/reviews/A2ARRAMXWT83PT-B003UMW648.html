The production felt rushed, and any form of character development is thrown to the winds. Everything begins so abruptly. The setup at the start of the film is almost a joke. The dude that portrays Prince Caspian comes off as a bit of a douche. There was also an overabundace of CGI, AND the director borrows liberally from THE LORD OF THE RINGS and every other fantasy film imaginable.<br /><br />All in all, this was an extremely disappointing experience. I'd compare it with the way I felt after seeing THE GOLDEN COMPASS, which was another pointless CGI-fest - although NARNIA wasn't as stupid. There were a few things to be admired here, but not enough for me to award it anything over two stars. By the way, Peter Dinklage was excellent as always, and was the only character that I cared about. I just hope that he moves away from this sort of thing. THE STATION AGENT was amazing...<br /><br />Anyways...I loved the first one, and nearly loathed this one. They need to scrap this and start all over again. C.S. Lewis is probably rolling in his grave. Bless his heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good but missing elements"></head><body><p>Instead of watching bits and pieces of the film I watched it in it's entirety today for the first time. Alien 3 is more of a dialogue film and Weaver's portrayal of Ripley was much more sullen. She remained interesting however. I was disappointed that Newt, a mega relevant charactor from Aliens, never had her name mentioned. With all the rightly emoted heartbreak by Ripley at the death of Newt, she never uttered an "Oh Newt" which is strangely amiss.<br /><br />The scene with Ripley and Bishop was engaging but I longed for an entirely reanimated "synthetic person" for charactor interaction. Alien 3 is unique in that there is very little gunfire, especially coming off the raging gunfire of Aliens. That missing element was never successfully counteracted. In turn, Ripleys every line became strong, and any return from her scene breaks worthwhile. It was almost as if she could bring out more in one word than ever before.<br /><br />The charactors were more often thin and I felt little concern for them. The setting though, and stylistic nature of the film, was more than ample. The early 90s CGI was a detractor but it may not have been for movie goers of that period. In a few scenes the alien looked puny. The penal colonists running around closing hatch doors was dizzying and weak. Child like "you hoo" words to lure the alien were unrealistic in such a fear oriented situation.<br /><br />The film was a hybrid of past greatness mixed with what was to come of the Alien franchise. And what was to come wasn't good. Sigourney Weaver held Alien 3 together just enough to make the film oddly interesting. The film makers knew it had run it's course, hence the climax. After this film, everything has became what I like to call "junkified". Alien 3 is a nice little last piece of one of filmdoms greatest heroines, and monsters!</p></body></html>

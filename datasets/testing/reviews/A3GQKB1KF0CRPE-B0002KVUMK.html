Hugh Jackman is wonderful; you cannot fault him, though you do chuckle - again, he is a man with power who cannot recall his past.  And Kate Beckinsale is really showing her stuff.  When you look at Cold Comfort Farm, Underworld and now Van Helsing, it shows there is little this lass cannot do and do well.  The action is non-stop - literally.  It must have more near escapes than any ten - make that twenty - movies put together.  The sets are moody and properly monster movie Gothic.  And you get Vlad Dracul, his brides and a horde of baby vampires - the children of the night - that Drac is trying to bring to life.<br /><br />But that is only the start.  There is Dr. Jekyll and Robbie Coltraine as Mr. Hyde - as an appetizer.  You mustn't forget a werewolf or two and Frankenstein's monster.  Oops, almost forgot Igor!  By this time, you are ready for Bobby "Boris" Pickett to break into The Monster Mash!  The same bunch that did such a bang on job with The Mummy, which I thoroughly enjoyed, does this.  Only someone needs to tell Stephan Sommers often less is more and more is just too much.  This movie is a perfect example of so much going for it - too much going for it - that it overwhelms you.<br /><br />Van Helsing (Jackman) is an immortal who has memories at being at Masada.  The Church sends him out to hunt down evil and smote it by any means needed.  After taking down and dispatching Jekyll/Hyde, they send him to Transylvania to handle Drac the naughty vamp.  Seems Dracula and his three brides are making a nuisance of themselves at a local village, and only thing keeping them and the werewolves in line as the ancient family Valerious, but they are now down to a brother and sister.  Anna Valerious watched as her brother battles a werewolf.  The brother saves her, but goes over the cliffs, later to become a werewolf.  Van Helsing and Carl, his religious sidekick, arrives on the scene, but the villagers are not so happy to see them.  Seems the vamps only want one or two villagers a month, not too bad, they think.  Carl please note is David Wenham (Faramir from Lord of the Rings!), in case he seems familiar.<br /><br />Van Helsing, Anna and Carl join forces and the villagers attitude soon changes as they learn the Dracula is trying to bring his thousands of bat babies to life.  The key is Frankenstein's monster, very sympathetically portrayed Shuler Hensley.  It comes down to a battle of the titans between Dracula and Van Helsing, (they second time they have gone down this road) and this time the town ain't big for two these two; one has to bite the dust or each other!<br /><br />The is no pace to this movie, it's totally pedal to the metal the whole way, where The Mummy movies see slow in comparison!  Shame.  This could have been one really great movie.  The cast was right.  Great special effects, it was just you feel like you have been beat over the head with every cinema monster ever to lumber through Universal's backlot.<br /><br />Obviously, this is left open for a sequel.  And despite this disappointment, I will be eagerly watching.  Maybe if they look at this one and see what they did wrong, second time around they might get it right.  Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi this ain't; it's not even the classy stylized battle of Lee and Cushing.  But they I didn't want it to be.  I just wanted a few moments to catch my breath.  The ending is very beautiful filmed and the emotions reach you, almost poetically.  Shame more of that could not have be sprinkled into this rest of the script.</p></body></html>

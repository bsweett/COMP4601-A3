Renee Zellweger plays his loving and faithful wife. Despite economic hardships, he never succumbed to booze, other women, or criminality. There's was a picture-perfect marriage though one battered by poverty, and many moviegoers will find that a refreshing change to the usual Hollywood depiction of marriages. Paul Giamatti turns in his usual brilliant acting as the manager-trainer. All of the minor characters are excellent.<br />The misery of Irish families living in squalor and poverty as shown in "Angela's Ashes" were brought vividly back to life in certain Depression scenes in "Cinderella Man" when a proud and determined James J. Braddock was fighting to stave off the desperation of poverty. What a different man he was than the husband in "Angela's Ashes" who was a weak man who sought consolation in alcohol.<br /> Braddock has great pride; it was against his principles to accept charity, but when his three children were suffering the cold and hunger, he bites his lip and passes the hat and also goes to social services. In his fighting comeback he becomes the great hero of the working Irish. His title fight with Max Baer (depicted as a monster and dirty fighter) is of epic proportions. The boxing scenes are handled very well (I just wish they had been shorter and been edited down more in the film.)<br /> Braddock, after breaking his hand and working as a stevedore on the docks, got a second chance as a boxer. It's an underdog success story, and is a well-constructed and well-performed effort. Though it has some of the clich&eacute;s of the boxing movie genre, it surmounts these and keeps the audience involved and committed.</p></body></html>

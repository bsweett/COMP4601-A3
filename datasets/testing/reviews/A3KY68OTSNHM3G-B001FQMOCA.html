He was very close to his older brother, Jack, but his father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was extremely strict with young John and forbade him from listening to the radio.  John looked to Jack for love and support, but Jack died in a freak table saw accident, leaving young John alone.  John's guilt is not helped when his father blames him for the accident, saying that the wrong son died.<br /><br />During the Korean conflict, John enlisted in the air force and was sent to Germany.  There, he saw a film about Folsom Prison.  Moved by the film, John wrote a song entitled "Folsom Prison Blues".  Upon his discharge from the air force, John returned to the United States and married his girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).  After the marriage, John tried (unsuccessfully) to make a living as a door-to-door salesman.  His heart was really in music, and he managed to get an audition with Sun Records executive Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).  Initially, the audition went poorly, as John and his group stuck to gospel music.  Sam informed the group that people were tired of listening to gospel and asked John if he had any other music to play.  John responded by playing "Folsom Prison Blues" and his career took off.<br /><br />After the success of the audition, John and his band began a tour with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, but there was one particular person who caught John's eye: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Although there was an attraction between the two, both were married to other people at the time.  But the chemistry was definitely there, as evidenced by their magic on-stage performances of such great songs as "Jackson", "Walk the Line", and "Ring of Fire" (which was written by June).  The two toured on and off for several years, and the strain began to take its toll on John.  By the time the decade of the 1960s began, John was fighting a battle against amphetamines.  His marriage to Vivian ended and he sought help from June to overcome his drug problem.  He moved into a new lakefront home after his divorce from Vivian.  While fighting his drug problem, he spent a great deal of time reading letters from prison inmates.  These letters led him to take an idea of a live concert from Folsom Prison to the executives at Columbia Records.  Initially rebuffed, John told them that they could destroy the tapes if they didn't like the live recording.  However, John's "Live At Folsom Prison" went on to become one of the biggest-selling albums ever made.<br /><br />After the Folsom Prison concert, John, June, and the others went to Ontario, Canada for another concert.  During the performance of "Jackson", John asked June to marry him.  He had asked her many times before, but was  turned down each time.  This time, however, June said yes, and they were married for 35 years until both passed away in 2003.  They spent their time with their families at the lake house fishing and enjoyng their family.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are simply perfect as Johnny and June, and both do their own singing in the movie.  Joaquin sounds exactly like Johnny did, and Reese was the perfect choice to play June.  Her voice is excellent as well.  The acting throughout the movie is great, and the songs bring back many memories.  Its easy to see why this movie was such a hit with so many movie critics.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see the rise and struggles of a country music legend.</p></body></html>

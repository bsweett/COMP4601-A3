I don't know what the problem is but most of the movie is just ruined by flat dialog that just seems to take all the energy out of what could have been a really great movie.<br /><br />The movie at the rare times that it does get genuienly funny is almost side splitting funny.<br /><br />Overall-Watch it but don't pay for the rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good"></head><body><p>i always applaud Michael Moore for going where so few other directors dare venture to. this Documentary focuses on the Subject of Health care and how the United States is Selective about sharing it whereas europe and other parts of the world are fair and reward there doctors,etc... on the subject matter and welcome all patients and everything is balanced. i enjoyed the depths and lengths that Moore went to. I dug the 9/11 tie in and the fireman being acknowledged. so many powerful moments in this film which were needed. a Good film and a must see.</p></body></html>

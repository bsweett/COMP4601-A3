To portray these characters, the powers that be recruited three of the finest film actors working today, as well as a talented director smart enough to get out of their way. The result is (not surprisingly) a powerful, gripping film.<br /><br />This film is not easy to watch. These characters are going through hell. Naomi Watts portrays a grief-stricken woman whose husband and two daughters are all killed in a hit-and-run. Sean Penn plays the heart-transplant patient who receives her husband's heart, and finds hiimself living with a strange combination of gratitude, guilt and terror. Benecio Del Toro is the born-again Christian and former convict who accidently killed the family, and is tormented by guilt and rage. Watching Watts, Penn, and Toro tackle these characters is truly magnificent, but also heartwrenching. Rage, guilt, heartbreak, suffering, need, empathy, fear, hatred, love, lust, hope ... these characters showcase humanity at its most raw. There seems to be some debate about the affectiveness of the non-linear way their stories are told, but I thought it worked beautifully. All in all, a terrific film.</p></body></html>

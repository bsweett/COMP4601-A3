<meta name="summary" content="sympathetic yet horrifying portrayal of a serial killer"></head><body><p>This is a great film.  The actors are absolutely first rate:  Theron must have gained 30 pounds for the part and is completely unrecognizable and thuggishly ugly; Ricci is a kind of mousy yet complicit accomplice, greedy for experience.  The two meet and find an unusal synergy:  Theron is a seriously troubled, alcoholic hooker with a horrible past and prone to violent rage, and Ricci is a lesbian trying to escape her prying family.  Somehow, they find love in a completely believable way.  In addition, the story is rivetting. To maintain their life style and express her rage, Theron goes on a murderous rampage of robbery and murder, after killing a brutal rapist.  In a way, she is searching for justice, but gets crazier as she continues and feels increasingly desperate to maintain Ricci's love, which is perhaps the only good thing she has ever known and yet based on the cash that Theron brings in.  It is very sad, the viewer empathizes with Theron, and yet feels repelled by the horror and confusion and murder.<br /><br />Truly masterful.  Recommended with enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

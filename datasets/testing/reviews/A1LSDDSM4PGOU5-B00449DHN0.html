<meta name="summary" content="long,but doesn't feel like it"></head><body><p>this is a Martin Scorsese epic,and it certainly has that epic feel.i'm<br />not sure how accurate it is historically,or if things really looked the<br />way they do in the movie.i still liked the look of it.to me,it seems a<br />lot of work went into the whole production and it shows.Daniel Day<br />Lewis is astonishing(nothing new for him).Leonardo DiCaprio was also<br />good.Cameron Diaz was not bad,but she didn't really impress me all that<br />much.her character wasn't as substantial as it could have been.like in<br />many movies,there's a good supporting cast.the movie is brutally<br />violent,which is probably an accurate depiction of that time.it is over<br />two and a half hours long,but it doesn't feel like it.i found myself<br />becoming very quickly and easily involved in the story,a sign of a good<br />movie.i wouldn't call it a masterpiece,but it is a very good movie.for<br />me,Gangs of New York is a 4/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL! 2 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>I went into the theater to watch The Wolfman with an open mind and lowered expectations after reading so many bad reviews. I'm a huge fan of the original film, and I was prepared for a few changes in the original story, but I didn't expect them to do a complete rewrite! While this new Wolfman film is slick looking on the surface, the convoluted story line of this remake takes the original's brilliant and simple story and makes it confusing and tedious with too many unintentional laughs.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />I have several gripes with this remake.<br /><br />1) Why does Hollywood insist on putting a romance front and center in every film at all costs!? The changes to the story are not only unnecessary, but absolutely ridiculous.  The original film did have a love interest, but it shared the center story with Talbot's father, who didn't believe in this Werewolf nonsense!  This made the ending heartbreaking in the original as Larry's father realizes he has killed his own son, making for a very dramatic climax! It's one of the most powerful scenes in the original film and it has been removed from the remake? This is like having King Kong win the plane battle on top of the Empire State building and go back to his island living happily ever after!<br /><br />2) There are too many sub plots, the brother's death, the mother's death, Larry's father is a werewolf, Larry is an actor?, Larry was in an insane asylum, Larry has dreams that make little to no sense.....etc...etc. This wouldn't be so bad if any of them helped to get the viewer involved in the story.....they do not!<br /><br />3) The make up created by Rick Baker is very good and I respect the fact that he pays homage to the original make-up, but Jack Pierce's original 70-year old make-up design is far superior. The CGI isn't too bad, but there are moments it looks cartoon-ish and unconvincing.  While there are some nice gore scenes, none of them evoke any fear because the film just isn't scary.  The Wolfman's howl is awful and it sounded like it was lifted from the film 'Teen Wolf', in fact the most ridiculous part of this film is the Werewolf battle between father and son, which really reminded me of 'Teen Wolf'!<br /><br />4) While the acting is very good, the dialogue is tedious and you know you're in trouble when one of the main characters has to give a speech halfway through the film to hopefully get everyone watching up to speed.<br /><br />5) The film tries to please too many demographics as it isn't scary--but it has some gore, it has a love interest--but it isn't moving and it has a good horror story--but it goes for the laughs.<br /><br />6) The film is only an hour and thirty five minutes, but seems longer and has no where near the atmosphere of the original.<br /><br />7) Danny Elfman's music score is inappropriately awful and doesn't even come close the the classic original score by Hans J. Salter!<br /><br />8) Benicio Del Toro gives a good perfomance, but there is no sympathy for him when he dies. While Lon Chaney jr. may have been heavy handed with his emotional performance in the original, Del Toro is not emotional enough and his character is not all that likable.<br /><br />The funny thing is as much as I thought this film was a missed opportunity, I still enjoyed it in a strange way. I just like monster movies I guess and it is unfortunate the studio didn't have the "sac" to make a film that was made for horror buffs and not for the "middle of the road" crowd. This could have been one of the scariest and saddest films of all time.<br /><br />In short the film looks good, but it just doesn't deliver the goods!  If you want to see some great Werewolf films watch the original Wolfman, Werewolf Of London, American Werewolf in London, or Dog Soldiers.</p></body></html>

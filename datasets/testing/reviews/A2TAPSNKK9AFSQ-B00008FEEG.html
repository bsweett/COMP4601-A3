The purpose of this movie seems to be to reassure  everybody that Aliens from Outer Space are all cute and friendly so you won't get an anal probe as reported by so many Alien Abductees selling their story to  newspapers as they have done over recent years.This movie is only redeemed by the presence of Ms. Dee Wallace-Stone who is a very Classy and Talented Actress.</p></body></html>

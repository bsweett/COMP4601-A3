The fact it happened to be foreign (insert "I have to read it?" now) didn't help my eagerness to see it during its initial release--but I did and, man, what a ride!  The fight scenes are brilliant and the poetic music only adds to its mass appeal; the acting, even in Mandarin-language, is brilliant and believable.  The story is solid and the filming is amazing as well.  Crouching Tiger is one of those movies that possess something magical.  The ending is one of the biggest heartache-inducing finales of any dramatic film in history in my opinion.  Crouching is poetic and beautiful, stellar and amazing.  This is THE foreign film to own!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They thought they'd survived the horror, but they were wrong"></head><body><p>I liked the first "Resident Evil" better.  I liked the way it opened and the entire idea of people having to go back into the Hive to find out what happened and look for survivors.  There is something to be said for the inherent tension in having to keep going forward when you should be turning around and getting the hell out of Dodge as quick as possible.  "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is about the getting the hell out of Dodge, or in this case Raccoon City, but there is a major problem in terms of the as quick as possible part, especially given that the city is about to be nuked.<br /><br />The Umbrella Corporation decided to reopen the Hive, which allows the T-virus to escape and turn the inhabitants of Raccoon City into zombies.  I might be slow when it comes to modern science, but I really fail to see the practical applications or economic potential of the T-virus given that it is not really regeneration human cells.  Now the nuke option is making a lot of sense, which is bad news for Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically created ultimate fighting machine, who is trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombies to safety.  But since this movie is based on a video game, things get worse.  The Umbrella Corporation sends Nemesis, a killing machine that may or may not be a genetically mutated version of Alice's boyfriend, Matt, from the previous film.  Apparently shooting people before nuking them is in the best interest of the corporation.  Go figure.<br /><br />Alice at least has some decent allies this time around, with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a demoted cop who is pretty good given that she has no genetic enhancements, and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), who leads what is left of an elite tactical team.  Weather reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) is as close as we get to the damsel in distress with this group, and she is not stupid.  The group has a glimmer of hope in that there is a scientist, Dr. Asher (Jared Harris), who created the T-virus and is wired into the city security system so that he can help them take the "easy" through zombie town.  All they have to do is rescue his daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), who was left behind.  So this is the "Resident Evil" equivalent of trying to get out of zombie town with one hand tied behind your back.<br /><br />I understand that there are a lot of things in "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" that are lifted from the various "Resident Evil" video games, but all of that is lost on me.  I am sure that this adds another dimension of enjoyment to the film, just like when I watch a "Spider-Man" movie and talk about what shots are taken from which cover by which artist.  A lot of this stuff is explained in the various commentary tracks, so there is ample opportunity to play catch-up, but it would all work a lot better if you have actually seen the video games.  The bad news is that the sequel seems much more like a video game as the survivors fight zombies, and then they fight mutant creatures, and then they fight the Umbrella Corp., and then they go through the whole cycle again.<br /><br />Taking the movie out of the Hive and up to the streets works against the tension and the terror, even when you throw in the zombie strippers (yeah, it sounds like a good idea, but it really is not).  I think the characters are more interesting this time, mainly because their collective competence level is a lot higher than the first film, but this is yet another film that turns the lights down low and edits like crazy to achieve its effects.  I am so sick and tired of movies resorting to that approach instead of just letting us see what is going on.  But this is a movie that really does not have much respect for the intelligence of its audience, all of whom would know to shot zombies wearing body armor in the head.  At least the movie makes the videogames look really good in comparison, so there is that.  You just have to be into playing the games.</p></body></html>

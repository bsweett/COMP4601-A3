Tarantino and George Clooney star as the Gecko Brothers; two looney outlaws on a crime spree that kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Lieu) to get across the Mexican border and are to meet an accomplace at a seedy bar.  But little do they know that this bar is overrun with vampires, and this is where the fun begins.  Honestly to all of those giving From Dusk Till Dawn a bad review have either never seen it or are still whining about the success of Pulp Fiction; From Dusk Till Dawn is a tribute to B-grade horror films of old that Mystery Science Theater 3000 loves to spoof, and that is what makes this film so fun.  The first half is a road movie which establishes the characters so the viewer can get to know them.  Keitel and Clooney are great in they're roles, especially when they have to interact with each other.  The second half of the film is an over the top blood spewing gore fest (of the R rated kind) that will have you laughing your head off if your not one of those delicate types.  All in all, From Dusk Till Dawn is a blatantly cheesy horror movie that is just a reminder of the days when you could have fun while making a movie, and the audience can have even more fun watching it.  The great cast includes Cheech Marin (in three roles), Fred Williamson (blaxploitation extrordonaire), super sexy Salma Hayek, Kelly Preston, B-movie god John Saxon, and gore meister Tom Savini as a whip brandashing biker.</p></body></html>

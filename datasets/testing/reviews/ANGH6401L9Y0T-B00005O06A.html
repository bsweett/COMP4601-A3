<meta name="summary" content="A Historically Significant Film"></head><body><p>This is a 2-disc special edition, and I'm thinking maybe the special "The Battle Over Citizen Kane" is almost as interesting as the original movie. The point is made that this movie constituted a battle between two enormous egos, two enormously successful men: William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles. Hearst was old by that time, and Welles was young. Hearst's empire you know about. Welles had been amazingly successful in radio and producing plays in New York. He was signed to an unprecedented contract with RKO when he came to Hollywood in 1939. The script of "Kane" was leaked to Hearst, and a huge battle ensued. Interestingly, he was not nearly so upset about the film's portrayal of himself as of his second wife -- that is, Kane's second wife; I'm not sure Hearst ever married the woman he lived with who was represented by Kane's second wife. Hearst managed to have RKO stop distribution of the film, so it did not become known outside of art-film theaters and college film-making courses until much later.<br /><br />The story opens with the death of Kane, and everything from there on is about reporters attempting to follow up on the mystery behind Kane's last word: "Rosebud." So there are interviews with the people who were important in Kane's life, and then flashbacks as they tell their stories. It's an effective way to tell a story which may have been original with this film. We are talking about a film released in 1941, after all. In fact, I think many things were either original to this film or developed into now-classic movie techniques by the film. For example, Kane gazes on a picture of the "best of the best" in his rival newspaper, which then morphs into a live grouping of the same men as they are being photographed upon their coming to work for Kane. Kane (Welles was a young and quite handsome man at the time) smiles and jokes charmingly over the fact that it took him six years to get what he wanted.<br /><br />Another interesting technique is a series of identically staged scenes that come immediately after one close associate comments that Kane's first wife probably rarely saw him except at breakfast. They both get older and fatter, their clothes become more expensive and elaborate, the opulent conditions in which they have their breakfast are more and more opulent, and she becomes more and more nagging and shrill. So we know it's over time, and the strong impression is that she grew increasingly bitchy and he grew increasingly tired of her. Very effective story-telling for what probably only lasts two minutes.<br /><br />There were enough differences between Hearst's life and Kane's that if he had wanted to, Welles could have fallen back on the old "it's only fiction" line in his battle with Hearst. But both were way too egotistical to allow any compromise. As the movie progresses, you can't help wondering who can be said to have won the battle in the long run.<br /><br />I'm going along with the critics who have said this is one of the best films ever made, but a bit too serious and demanding of its audience to ever be one of the most popular.</p></body></html>

It, in fact, looks like a crazy quilt of CGI work, furious jump-cutting, and a constant aesthetic that is WAY too grim after seeing it only the second time! There should be some respite from all the ghoul-chasing so that a good contrast can be set, instead of a steady diet of lab-OR-atories, gothic architecture. lightning bolts and bloodletting. This worked with "Ghostbusters" and "Aliens", it should have been used here.<br /><br />That said, it does have some redeeming aspects, not the least of which is the wizard art direction, which must have driven the miniature people bazoomies! The intricate castles, furniture, room embellishments, and various devices that Van Helsing uses put you in mind of a high-budget version of the "The Wild Wild West" meets "Indiana Jones" meets "The Name of the Rose" meets "Ghostbusters". The writing, too, warrants some kudos....Jackman himself speaks a litany of James Bondian wisecracks all through the movie, but it is Roxburgh who gets the really good lines, along with David Wenham, playing Van Helsing's friar sidekick.<br /><br />I think I'm beginning to notice a pattern, though, in Hugh Jackman's movies....In X-Men 2, Deathstrike, a Japanese mutant that has a duel with Wolverine, played by Jackman, meets a GRUESOME death at the hands of the feral X-Man, having molten lead forced through her body by a berserker Jackman. In THIS movie, the Kate Beckinsale character, Van Helsing's potential love interest through the whole movie, dies....AT VAN HELSING'S HAND!! Granted, he was a werewolf at the time, but STILL...!! What does Hugh Jackman have against young women, anyway??<br /><br />Still this movie is going to come in awfully handy at Halloween, a season that it was made for!<br /><br />And as far as a ghoulishly-themed movies are concerned, you could do LOTS worse in today's market.</p></body></html>

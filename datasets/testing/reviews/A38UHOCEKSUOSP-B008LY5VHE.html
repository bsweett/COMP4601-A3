<meta name="summary" content=""This shark, swallow ya whole""></head><body><p>Just goes to show that they just don't make horror movies the way they used to in Hollywood.  The thing about Jaws is that it goes beyond a horror film....it is a masterpiece.  While today's horror films continue to pour on the blood and guts and sacrificing B-actors and a poor story/script, Jaws shows us that a horror film can be big, directed well, contain a tight story and feature top A-list actors in Hollywood.  Chances are you have seen this film by now, if not, jump on in...the water's fine.<br /><br />If there is one negative surrounding Jaws is that it eventually produced some embarassing sequals.  If there is one negative thing about the first Jaws, its that the shark can look fake.  Ironically, it looked better to me than any of the sequals, and we don't really see much of the shark until the films end.  That's the beauty of the horror surounding this film.  We see helpless people swimming in the water, and then out of nowhere the screaming and panic begins, without even seeing the shark.  That is the real scare to this film.  In its day, there were definetly some intense scenes of blood (not so much gore except for a guy's leg falling off).  One scene still compete's today with any blood-filled horror film and that is near the end of Jaws, when the shark jumps on the boat and Quint (Robert Shaw) falls into its mouth, wrestling for about 20 seconds with his lower torso being chomped.<br /><br />What makes the film so accomplished in the end is much more than the horror.  The characters are superb, and the wonderfully written script is used so well by the actors.  Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw share incredible chemistry in this film, with scene after scene of frustrations, anger, joy and cooperation.  Watching these three in action is a show in itself.  Though not known for its comedy aspects, I found little lines and scenes here and there to be extremely funny, given the nature of things.<br /><br />What bugs me the most about the dvd, is when I have watched Jaws on television there are several extended scenes (not deleted scenes) that are not included on dvd.  I actually like these scenes too and miss them when I watch my dvd.<br /><br />Jaws is a 5 star classic - easily.  It has gone down as one of the greatest horror film accomplishments of all time.  It certainly is not the scariest movie you will see today, but it is an A+ in every regard.  Don't watch this in the bathtub.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Horror - 4.5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></body></html>

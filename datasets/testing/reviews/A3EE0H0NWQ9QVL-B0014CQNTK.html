<meta name="summary" content="Naturally Sweet and Sage"></head><body><p>Warm, smart, and funny `Juno' is a sympathetic look at teen pregnancy.  Starting out during her consummation, the titled character (Ellen Page) shares the details of her infatuation with high school track star, Paulie Bleaker (Michael Cera, `Superbad'), takes it to her discovery of pregnancy (in the presence of a convenience store clerk, played acerbically by Rainn Wilson) until she follows through her decision resolving her "problem".<br /><br />Enthusiastic, but trying not to care so she won't get hurt, Juno comes across her pregnancy flippantly as a minor inconvenience.  Juno is named after Zeus's wife (technically Jupiter, but Hera's name wouldn't fit).  Her father named her as a self-fulfilling prophecy of her natural beauty.  Her dad (J.K. Simmons, Spiderman 3') is ex-military.  He's divorced, but married to a born-again Christian, whom he's found stability for ten years.  Her best friend, Ellen, is the only one on whom she confides, and her boyfriend is someone she hasn't quite locked down in her emotions.<br /><br />Juno knows her choices.  She is as innocent and na?ve as she is knowledgeable about what she could do with her baby.  Discerning what's given to her, she decides to have the baby and give it up for adoption.  She finds her potential couple in an advertisement flyer, but once her decision is made, she has to let her father and step-mother know.<br /><br />Much of the movie shows a perky Juno discovering the trek of her pregnancy.  The movie has such a natural tone and delivery from its characters, they seem like people we all know.  Juno gets to know the adopting couple from St. Cloud, MN, a relatively short trek from her own Twin Cities suburban home.  The film makes discoveries about her relationship to Paulie Bleaker and the details of the adopting couple (Here Jason Bateman's appearance brings a real time warp to the picture.) that seem organic and natural.  Ellen Page is so good with her role that I wouldn't leave out the possibility of an Oscar nomination.  Her range of emotions is good; the discoveries her character makes are believable; and her witty, fast-pitch lines are blurt-out funny.  Everyone else is identifiably genuine as well.<br /><br />While the old fashioned paradigm of the nursery rhyme comes leaping to mind, "First comes love, then comes marriage, then come..someone...in the baby carriage," real life, especially today, is often not like that.  Without much maliciousness--except for what normally comes to us--`Juno' leaves a lingering sweetness that isn't artificially enhanced.</p></body></html>

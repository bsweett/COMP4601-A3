<meta name="summary" content="Battles"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the first film, though it was certainly aimed at children.  Prince Caspian however takes a darker turn for Narnia.  The 4 children return to the magical kingdom a year later, but in Narnia more than a thousand years has passed.  A kingdom of men has taken over Narnia and driven the magical creatures into the woods and near extinction.  I found the visuals very pleasing and if you are a fan of battles, you certainly have more than your share in this story.  They are bloodless affairs, but they do feel very Lord of the Ringish.  I enjoyed the story and the more adult natured storyline.  I will certainly purchase this and eagerly await the next installment in the series.</p></body></html>

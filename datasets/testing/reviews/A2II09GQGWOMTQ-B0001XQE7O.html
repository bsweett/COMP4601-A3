<meta name="summary" content="Quite possibly Tim Burton's finest film."></head><body><p>A very bizarre movie even for Tim Burton, Big Fish is one of my favorites.<br />Wonderful acting, Jessica Lang is particularly powerful in this movie.<br />The rest of the cast is equally talented, bringing some funny moments, some strange moments and some tear jerking moments.<br />I think this movie was compared to Forrest Gump a lot. I can see the reasons, but I believe this to be the superior film.<br />Both movies have incredulous story lines, but in Gump's case, they tried to make the impossible seem real. In Big Fish's case, you never know what is real and what isn't. You won't know the truth until the very touching end.<br />Brilliantly directed, and unbelievably overlooked by many film lovers.<br />I'd put Big Fish in my top twenty any day.<br />Brilliant, strange, touching and memorable, Big Fish achieves greatness on every level.<br />Another brilliant contribution from Tim Burton, do your self a favor and rent this.<br />I think you'll be amazed by just how original and innovative this movie is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Dark  but Brilliant Movie"></head><body><p>Patrick Marber, the author of the play by the same name wrote the screenplay for Mike Nichols' screen adaption so I assume he's happy with this production. First, Mike Nichols continues to give us one fine movie after another-- from his first THE GRADUATE to his most recent ANGELS IN AMERICA. This film is no exception and is wonderfully filmed-- there are lots of closeups of the characters that we expect from Nichols and certainly appropriate here since the movie essentially is about four individuals who do an awful lot of talking-- when they aren't changing partners and bedrooms. The acting is superb: Julia Roberts as Anna, Jude Law as Dan, Nathalie Portman as Alice and Clive Owen as Larry give tremendous performances. These are beautiful people who are selfish and nasty to everyone they should care about most, i.e., their spouses and/or lovers.<br /><br />A friend of mine used to say that he didn't care for either fiction or movies if he couldn't like any of the characters. Using that criterion, this movie falls on its face. On the other hand, if you want to see people acting very badly and completely self-centered, then you'll find this movie to your liking.<br /><br />Alice says it all in a scene near the end of the movie when she finally kicks Dan out of her life, saying something to the effect that he didn't have to be cruel to her by being unfaithful and sleeping with Anna, that all of us should realize that there's a line we shouldn't cross in order to prevent hurting someone we love. With the possible exception of Anna, these people will do whatever it takes to get what they think they want and have no interest in staying within boundries.<br /><br />A dark, well acted, well directed movie.</p></body></html>

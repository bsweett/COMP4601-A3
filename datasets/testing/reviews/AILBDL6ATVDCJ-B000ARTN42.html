<meta name="summary" content="Best Movie of the Year!  Russell Crowe and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger are captivating on screen!"></head><body><p>Not only is this movie the best release in 2005, it is also Russell Crowe's best performance to date.  I'll take that even one step further and declare that this movie should earn Ren&eacute;e Zellweger a BEST ACTRESS award.<br /><br />There are so many things to love about this movie that I don't really know where to begin, but I'll try:<br /><br />#1.  The cinematography is captivating, drawing the audience into the Great Depression and the anguish that it was.  Every frame seemed to bring the struggle of the times to life on the screen - more so than any movie I can think of.<br /><br />#2.  The script for this movie cuts out any unnecessary scenes that might cause the movie to drag.  I saw a few reviewers thought the movie started off a little slow.  I could not disagree with them more!  This movie grabs you from the very beginning and never lets you go!<br /><br />#3.  Russell Crowe seemed to transform himself into the boxer, Jim Braddock, and I have never seen Crowe perform this good.  I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD!<br /><br />#4.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger works magic in her role as Braddock's wife, Mae.  Her performance left very few dry eyes in the movie theater I was in.  I was reading the book just before I watched the movie, and if ever an actress "nailed" a role, Renee Zellweger does with this one.  I will always see her as Mae!<br /><br />#5.  Paul Giamatti rises to the occasion, with a superb reincarnation (okay, that's an exaggeration) of Joe Gould, Jim Braddock's friend and manager.  Paul adds so much flavor and character to this film that I could not imagine anyone else in his role.<br /><br />#6.  Every teenager in America should be required to watch this film.  It could be used as a learning tool to inspire young people to save money, teach them to enjoy the things they have in life right now, and remind them that times are not really "so hard" compared to what the people went through seventy years ago.<br /><br />This movie can really put into perspective the silliness of kids crying over not being able to own a 200-dollar pair of gym shoes!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, what are you waiting for?  This is the best film out this year!  And yes, it is a must-see!<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Saga Continues....."></head><body><p>Most of my friends insist that "Spider-Man 2" is better than the original.  Now, I like "Spider-Man" immensely.  Instead of viewing one film inferior to the other I feel that "Spider-Man 2" should be viewed as the logical extension of an ongoing saga.  The first film did an excellent job of explaining the origins of Spider-Man.  The second film explores what it actually means to be Spider-Man.  Essentially Peter Parker-Spider-Man is in the midst of an identity crisis here.  Tobey Maguire does an excellent job in showing the angst of being a superhero.  Kirsten Dunst, once again, glows as Mary Jane Watson.  Alfred Molina is outstanding as Otto Octavius-Doc Ock.  It's refreshing that the filmmakers have cast an actor for their appropriateness for the role instead of some major star who just bring their name to the proceedings i.e. the "Batman" films.  Once again Sam Raimi brings a sure hand to the proceedings and Alvin Sargent should be commended for writing a script that adds depth and shading to the characters.</p></body></html>

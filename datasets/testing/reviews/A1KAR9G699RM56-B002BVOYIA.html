The characters name is Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), a man who really existed (and still does), and did become more then a hero for those who were protected in the hotel.  This is that story, and I assure you is quite good.<br /><br />With so many great film aspects too because the acting itself was quite superb, and recognized as many were nominated for Oscars.  However, more then that the movie just seemed to capture the tension, violence, and just absurdity that occurred in those few month's.<br /><br />Because as I mentioned before, the world mostly ignored the violence, yet with this film one cannot escape the realities that were those of the day, in Paul Rusesabagina's home of Rwanda.</p></body></html>

The film's great for eye-candy, the cast is gorgeous and the illusions are good.  What bogs the story down are endless plot complications that just bog the story down.<br /><br />Loved the one piece of history regarding Tesla and Colorado Springs--that is semi-true and would make a film in and of itself.</p></body></html>

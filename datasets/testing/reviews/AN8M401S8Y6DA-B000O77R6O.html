We all search for more time but what are we missing while we search."></head><body><p>That is the message that came through to me in Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain which goes about as deep as your imagination wants to go.  Aronofsky is one of the most ambitious and creative of modern filmmakers and writers, and The Fountain is one ambitious and touching project.  Other creative and ambitious directors/writers that come to mind in the same class are Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind) and the new Mexican wave of directors Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Children of Men), Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu (Babel), and the great Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth).<br /><br />As I said this film could be analyzed and go as deep and as personal as you like, you can literally make this film your own.  For me it was about searching for time and what your missing while you search.  What better actor then to cast in such a role then Hugh Jackman who in 2006 appeared in 6 films including The Fountain, Happy Feet, Flushed Away, The Prestige, Scoop, and X-Men the Last Stand.  Jackman in that year brought himself to a new level, how busy must he have been, what was he missing out on while working so hard, maybe that is why he delivers such a real and touching performance.  Another perfectly cast role is Aronofsky's wife Oscar Winner Rachel Weisz in a story where she is someones wife and dying, she was powerful in this and I'm sure it hit home with such topics and only having to look over her shoulder to see the love of her life and imagine him in Jackman's role.  Jackman is unable to accept her dying, he is in a position to make a change being a scientist, he is so close and time is running out.  He misses the walk of the first snow with her due to working for a cure, he is not at her bedside when she needs him, so while he is busy trying to have more time with her he is losing the time he could be having.  Weisz's character is writing a book "The Fountain" where a conquistador goes on a mission to find the fountain of youth while in the process all of Spain's men are slain.  She leaves the last chapter for her husband to finish.<br />This could apply to anyone who puts in too much overtime to provide for their family or is so into there career and getting more and more that there missing out on their kids childhood and that you can't get back.<br /><br />Another point as brought up as he died so we could live, in the process of trying to save his wife he makes an amazing discovery which could help many people, so because of her illness she inspires him to find a cure and if she dies her death could have saved countless others.  And you could keep going and analyzing this bold tale of life and death and choices.<br /><br />I gave this 4.5 stars as 10minutes before the end I found the film to lose itself for a time being, however I might have just been lost, I still found it to be a powerful and touching  film.  The theory of a person being buried and growing into a tree and death is life, and the sole lives on, like those messages this movie for me evolves and transcends beyond a film and into a message and a feeling.  Even if I forgot the film's specifics and the characters names over time, to think of the Film I would still remember the feeling it gave me and the message I took from it.</p></body></html>

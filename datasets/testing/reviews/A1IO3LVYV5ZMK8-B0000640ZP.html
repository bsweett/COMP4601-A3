<meta name="summary" content="HAUNTINGLY POIGNANT"></head><body><p>While most of the movie-goers will focus on the inevitable irony of Nicole Kidman starring in a movie produced by her erstwhile husband Tom Cruise, THE OTHERS directed by Alejandro Amenabar of Open Your Eyes fame scores beautifully with its elegantly controlled suspense and horror. Just when you thought Ms. Kidman's career has taken a backseat after the divorce, she slams critics with an intensifying performance as Grace, the mother of two children, Annie and Nick (James Bentley) subjected to a mysterious disease that forbids them to come under strong light. With the misty landscape of a British coast and a cavernous mansion, where Grace practises locking one door before entering the next to prevent sunlight from filtering in - the mystery sets in - even more so after a housekeeper Mrs. Mills with her motley gang steps in. <p>THE OTHERS may lack the intrigue in the Sixth sense as a paramormal scarefest but it boasts an unexpected twist that justifies the slow pacing. The performance of Ms. Kidman as a forlorn wife waiting for the return of her husband (Christopher Eccleston) is sterlingly vulnerable and emotive. THE OTHERS after a slew of right-in-your-face horror gore offered by this summer's Jeepers Creepers and 13th ghost is almost acutely refreshing. With its seasoned acting and Amenabar's prudent directing, it more than compensates for the gloomy mood enshrouding the movie that tests the patience of the audience. However, when the ending is revealed, the melancholic tragedy of Grace comes out hauntingly poignant and judiciously rewards the audience for the wait.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I did not like it.... I'll stick wit the original version..."></head><body><p>I did not like it....<br />Why? Because it seems like a big rock video. It looks like a production designer's let's-make-it-weird paradise: something copied from a "Prodigy meets Marilyn Manson"... something copied from other movies... "The Cell", "Seven", etc... this is clearly a product for the Britney Spears audience.<p>It has none of the original cruelty nor humour. Everybody seems to be too beautiful and sexy. The original was dry, dusty, cheap and very potent. This version is advertising.<p>Try it for yourself and (also) see the original.<br />Me? No!</p></body></html>

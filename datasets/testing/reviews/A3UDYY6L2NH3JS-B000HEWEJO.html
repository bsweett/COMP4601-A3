<meta name="summary" content="A fighting life is better than death"></head><body><p>This film has been used and even overused as the model to many others. A  man is framed by the local capitalist in Bedford Falls who wants to put his hands on the business this man manages to the sole benefit of his clients. His whole life was a fight against injustice, against greed, against inhuman capitalists who consider other men as mere toys on their chessboard. He is led to the envy to commit suicide. But God sends an angel to save him. The method is simple : grant his wish, temporarily, not to have been born. And we have a trip in this society the way it would be if the greedy capitalist, Mr Potter, had not had our hero as a fighting counterpart. The vision of this would-be world is drastic and absolutely dramatic. The worse sides of every man have found the proper environment to prosper and build an unethical world especially by expelling all those who had a moral sense. He then has the possibility to go back to his real life and he discovers that he can escape bankrupcy and all it means for his clients thanks to his friends, nearly the whole population of Bedford Falls who give him the little money thay can find for him to go through this difficult situation and prevent Mr Potter from putting his claws on the city. Capitalism is a fighting tool for those who want to unite against greed and to join forces and will to promote a better world. This trick of seeing what the world would be if the greedy had the upper hand was used in many other films, for one the Back to the Future trilogy. This film is also a tremendous boost for those who doubt the outcome of their fight against immoral powerful people : fight and fight again and never forget that ? no man is a failure who has friends ?. It is true it is hard at times to see it, but yet any rockbottom despair is not worth dying since it would give an easy victory to the immoral band of people who take advantage of capitalism to impose their will and greed over the whole world.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

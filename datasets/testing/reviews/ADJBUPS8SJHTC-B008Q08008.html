<meta name="summary" content="What a movie!"></head><body><p>Incredible is what I can describe this man's life story. Here you have a concert pianist, who with his family, ends up in the Warsaw ghetto, but by one of the Capo guards pulling him out of line, Spillman was able to escape the fate of many other Jews during that time. What surprised me is the Nazi Officer's compassion towards him(probably thinking that it was too late in the game to shoot him or send him off),even to the point of giving him his coat(which almost got him shot when the Russians came to Warsaw),but still a great film just the same. I cannot compare it with Schindler's List, since I haven't seen it in its entirety, but I feel that it is worth every five and more of its stars.</p></body></html>

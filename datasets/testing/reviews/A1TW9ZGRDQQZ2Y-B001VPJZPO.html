<meta name="summary" content="A Very Effective Atmospheric Thriller with a Killer Twist Ending"></head><body><p>I just got back from seeing The Skeleton Key starring the ever cute Kate Hudson. The first 90 minutes or so were good, but I would have given the film only 3 stars if it weren't for the ending. There are a couple of twists towards the end, but the final one is totally unexpected. I thought surprise endings were played out after all of the recent films that have tried to copy the Sixth Sense, but this one really caught me off guard. This film isn't scary in the least, but it is rather suspenseful, has great bayou locations, and Kate Hudson turns in a good performance. Worth checking out in theaters.</p></body></html>

The Cold War between the US and Russia shows no sign of thawing. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) can no longer see the future and he believes the reason is nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />One of the last masked superheroes takes a fall from his highrise apartment to the ground below. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) was a precarious mixture of good and evil and someone finally took him out while he was watching television.<br /><br />The US government led by 5 term president, Richard M. Nixon (Robert Wisden) has outlawed masked heroes. Only Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is still on the streets trying to fight crime.  He's trying desperately to find the man who killed the Comedian, but none of his old co-horts seems to care.<br /><br />This is just the setup for "The Watchmen" Spring 2009's predicted blockbuster.  The film, which runs at an impressive 163 minutes, is based on Alan Moore's acclaimed graphic novel.  The director, Zack Snyder, used a great deal of Dave Gibbons's original art as a storyboard for the film and it really does show.<br /><br />Two of the most compelling actors in this story are Haley as the crusading Rorschach, who still believes in the superheroes and helping his own, and the Morgan, who plays an intense Comedian whose actions make one wonder why even Rorschach wouldn't be better off just walking away.<br /><br />The CGI for this film is spectacular, but be warned, the action is quite real and not for the squeamish or very young. Violence against women and children is particularly rough, but faithful to what I remember from the originals.  I admit, seeing real actors conveying the story is quite a bit different than looking at one dimensional drawings and for me, the film had much more impact.<br /><br />The music is some of the most evocative of the 60's, 70's and 80's, including "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen and "Sounds of Silence" by Simon and Garfunkel.<br /><br />I can't speak to the faithfulness to the original work. I read the story back when they were still comics and CGI wasn't even a gleam in a geek's eye.  And yet, so many of the characters and thoughts from this novel have haunted me for years.<br /><br />I will probably see the film again and will definitely purchase the soundtrack.  "Watchmen" is well worth 3 hours of your time and if you're like me, you will be thinking of the film for some time to come.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, March 2009</p></body></html>

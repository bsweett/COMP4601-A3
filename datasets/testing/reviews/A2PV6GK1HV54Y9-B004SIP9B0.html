Thank goodness for Mirren, her delicate performance saved this film from sinking, her Oscar was much deserved. Most of the film surrounds the death of Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth wasn't a fan of hers by any means. I was expecting more of a dramatic film, the Brits really are stuffy. This a mixed bag for me.</p></body></html>

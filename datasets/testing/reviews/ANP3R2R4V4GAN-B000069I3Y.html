It goes back and forth in two guys messed up lives and doesn't resolve itself but it does speak to their basic responsibility and both actors giv epretty good performances.  They essentially play two screwed up guys who intersect in funny and sad ways.  Reflections of teh others.  People attached to negative energy.</p></body></html>

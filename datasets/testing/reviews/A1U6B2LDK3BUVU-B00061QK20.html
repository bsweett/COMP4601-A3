Its greatest strength is its physical beauty, its use of color, its use of masses of uniformed men, the panoply of it all.<br /><br />Its greatest weakness for me was that it had me experiencing the agitation of its main characters.  That's never fun for me.  It is a bit emotionally draining.<br /><br />We have the convention of one individual outperforming thousands, the super-hero silliness.  But rather than criticize the unreality of it, we can only accept it as part of the surreal character of a film that is a beautiful poem to watch.<br /><br />The plot doesn't bear scrutiny.  It is a story of assassins whose target is an ambitious king of a region of China, intent on conquering the nation piece by piece in order to unify all of it.<br /><br />Do the assassins want revenge for the attack against their own region, or do they choose to sacrifice their own land in favor of unity?  Are they assassins or aren't they?<br /><br />Why stop at China?  Why not justify the conquest of the entire world in the name of unity?  Wouldn't this prevent future wars?<br /><br />No of course it wouldn't.  There would be the rebellions.  Unity works best when the defeated party has a change of heart and rejoins the nation, as happened in the USA.<br /><br />Human rights are more important than political unity, which can be either good or bad.  Do we unify the world in the name of Hitler?  Unity in itself is neither good nor bad, and accepting this truth weakens the argument of this movie.<br /><br />The plot is pretty weak, since it all boils down to whether the assassins want to kill or don't.  What kind of movie is that?  I want to kill you.  No, on second thought, maybe I don't.  I don't think it is much of a plot.<br /><br />The weakness of the plot and the agitation of the main characters influence me to knock the rating down to 3 stars, but the beauty of the movie prevents me from dropping any lower.</p></body></html>

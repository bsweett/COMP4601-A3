<meta name="summary" content="Dark + Suspenseful + Twisted + Unexpected turns = One of the best suspense movies of all times"></head><body><p>This move is dark, suspenseful, twisted with quite a few unexpected turns. It's one of the best suspense movies of all times. The acting and directing are convincing and gripping. This is one of the best films of Kim Basinger. I don't like her acting in most other films</p></body></html>

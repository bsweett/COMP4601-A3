<meta name="summary" content="the water in Iowa really sucks"></head><body><p>Today's horror filmmakers (or, rather, film re-makers) keep on lifting from past horror flicks. This time, the source is George Romero's dubious 1973 cult classic. Director Breck Eisner modernizes the story and tries to switch things up a bit by focusing more on the tiny pack of survivors, and less from the military's perspective. THE CRAZIES is a mean and vicious B-horror survival flick, and I do think it superior to the original.<br /><br />There's always a more gothic feel when the venue veers away from the city and into the countryside, right? THE CRAZIES tells of an apocalypse in the Heartland, in the small midwestern town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa (population: 1,200 or thereabouts, but soon dropping at an alarming rate). The story opens with Johnny Cash somberly serenading you and me to "We'll Meet Again," and I couldn't help but note how ideal to horror cinema is Johnny Cash's ominous gravel voice. He establishes a disquieting mood, gets you all fretting.<br /><br />This movie is a germophobe's pick of the week. A government plane, conveying an experimental bio-toxin, goes down in the woods and infects the water supply. The inhabitants of Ogden Marsh are soon succumbing to weird stupors and then behaving irrationally, and then murderously. Our point-of-view characters are Sheriff Dave Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant physician wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and we track them in the course of 24 hours as they're caught in the middle of a harrowing outbreak.<br /><br />This remake tones down the political allegory so rife in Romero's original version. But there's enough going on in the world currently that Breck Eisner does inject certain themes. The film taps into your deepest sense of paranoia, not of ghosts or zombies, but of more topical concerns - one's fear of disease and infection, one's suspicion of our neighbors, and disillisionment with the government. The military - its grunts gigged out in uniform gas masks - is so concerned with covering its tracks and containing the leaked toxin that it promptly quarantines the town and begins to herd and corral the locals. Except that these viruses are always crazy virulent, aren't they? Things quickly get out of hand. Wash, rinse, repeat.<br /><br />Communications are cut off in Ogden Marsh, signals to all cell phones and to the Internet abruptly killed. And with the town isolated and mass psychosis at hand, society rapidly breaks down. Darwinism kicks in, anarchy descending like a swift mother. In an apocalypse, ain't that the way the cookie crumbles? Can the Sheriff guide his tiny band of gibbering townspeople out of the quarantined zone?<br /><br />Oh, to be unhinged and creepy. THE CRAZIES accomplishes what it sets out to do. It serves up chills to ripple up and down your spine. That dish of bleakness comes as dessert. Director Breck Eisner demonstrates restraint. He underplays things and takes time to establish plot and character. He stages long moments in which he lets the nervous tension build up. And when the terrifying set-pieces finally come around, he unleashes his inner gorehound.<br /><br />These demented infecteds aren't shambling zombies; they aren't zombies at all. To paraphrase someone from the DVD's extra features, these infected are actually bursting with too much life, the virus in them raring to manifest thru their skin. This results in the crazies sporting wicked blood blisters, taut veins, and popping tendons. Somewhere, a dermatologist is tossing and turning. But these make-up visuals prove really effective. The film gratifies the hard-core horror fan, gives the people what they want, to the tune of a series of bloody (and blood-curdling) sequences: a madman puncturing victims with a pitchfork in a medical triage, the Sheriff's encounter with a berserk doctor's bone saw, a pair of locos operating a truck stop service... But the most memorable scene features the Sheriff's nasty, grimace-inducing method of dispensing with one insane woman. This movie is enough to make me swear off water for life. Or at least give up tap water.<br /><br />Kudos to Joe Anderson, by the way, for making the most out of his Deputy role. For my money, Joe Anderson ends up with the most interesting character arc in this film.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary with director Breck Eisner<br />- "Behind the Scenes with Breck Eisner" - pretty much the Making Of featurette (00:10:32 minutes long)<br />- "Paranormal Pandemics" -  Director Breck Eisner and Make-Up Artist Rob Hall discuss the source material for the look of the crazies, referencing real life diseases and how they distort the appearance of the infected (00:09:38 minutes long)<br />- "The George A.

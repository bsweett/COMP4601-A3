<meta name="summary" content="excellent, but not a "classic""></head><body><p>This is an extremely good film (on a four-star scale, I'd give it 3.5), but not the masterpiece it's been called.<br /><br />As with virtually every biopic ever made, the writer is obliged to create artificial-sounding dialog that sums up what's been going on prior to the current scene, or clumsily reveals a character's thoughts. "Milk" is better than most, but it still has its share.<br /><br />One of the script's good points is its refusal to demonize Dan White, who's portrayed as a thoroughly confused and unbalanced human being. (It's not surprising he eventually committed suicide.) Though obviously a queer-hater, one gets the feeling that White's murder of Milk and Moscone was primarily more to his being politically thwarted and "humiliated". Even had the conflict not been over gay rights, he probably would killed whomever he thought had harmed him. (Moscone wasn't gay.) He did not understand the nature of politics.<br /><br />Harvey Milk seems to have understood, though. He's willing to say what White wants to hear, then reverse himself, which did not endear him to White.<br /><br />My only gripe is the obvious fiction of presenting what was going through Harvey Milk's mind when he was killed. It's more silly than anything (he apparently associates his murder with Tosca's death), and it hurts the tone of a film that gives at least the illusion of accuracy. It also comes dangerously close to portraying Milk as a martyr.<br /><br />Fine performances all around, especially Penn's and Brolin's. I don't know why people dump on Sean Penn. In this film, he quite disappears into the role. What more do you want from an actor?<br /><br />For those straight viewers uncomfortable not only with men kissing each other, but with male effeminacy... There are all kinds of homosexual men, ranging from transvesites and swishes to men of ordinary (sometimes hyper) masculinity who are not easily recognized. Thirty years ago, the latter tended to remain invisible and not take part in politics. Which is why you don't see many of them in this film.<br /><br />Highly recommended -- especially to those people who ought to see it, but will refuse to.<br /><br />Beautiful Blu-ray transfer.</p></body></html>

Witness for example the villians of STAR WARS: Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and Darth Maul; or the man-eating shark in JAWS; or Shakespeare's MacBeth or Iago. In 1991 another villian entered the collective group conscience and grew into a larger figure in the fabric of American pop culture. That villian's name is Hannibal Lecter and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS marked the beginning of his dynasty. Now he's back in a sequel that bears his name, HANNIBAL.<p>In the film it has been ten years since Lecter escaped from prison. He is now living in Italy as a Renaissance scholar named Dr. Fell. However, he is eager to come out of "retirement". The heroine of LAMBS, Clarice Starling, has been publicly humiliated by a botched drug raid and is put back on the Lecter case after the Justice Department gains new information concerning the cannibal's whereabouts. Starling chases the lead and the game begins anew.<p>Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Lecter and Julianne Moore fills Jodie Foster's shoes well as Starling. Ridley Scott's direction is once again masterful and the other performances and crafts of the rest of the cast and crew are just as excellent.<p>With that said, HANNIBAL is a major disappointment. The movie starts off suspenseful, but soon falls into predictability. Sure there are a few gory twists and turns, but you know Lecter is going to escape and that he won't harm Clarice.<p>The movie started a controversy because of the violent, campy, gore. Certain individuals will want to see it just for those "cool" scenes. However, as much as I like Anthony Hopkins and as intriguing a character Hannibal Lecter is, the movie was a big let down. Just not enough substance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HHHHHHHHHHHHHHere's Johnny!!"></head><body><p>This movie and Batman are my 2 favorites of JACK's.<br />To much peace & quit can drive someone insane.<br />It's always good to have a shot of Jack Daniels at the bar,<br />even if there's no liquor in the whole Hotel.<br />Being secluded is starting to play on JACK's head.<br />As he tries to kill his wife & son, he suddenly finds<br />himself lost and outside in the freezing cold.<br />Don't forget to checkout even though you can never leave...<br />A must see, I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

The first is the Parris Island training base for Marines and the second is in Viet Nam during the Tet offensive. In the first section we see how young men are turned into soldiers and in the second section we see how they perform under real war conditions. Yet there is a dark undercurrent that in the first section asks why such extreme techniques are necessary to create group cohesion and directed aggression in young men and in the second section asks whether the official stated purpose for war runs counter to the experiences of those on the front lines. It is Kubrick's skills that bring in just enough humor, horror, violence, and absurdity to keep the film constantly entertaining. Under war conditions, it is the front line troops with their dark humor that point to the absurdity of their goals and situation. The film rings especially true in this time where we are engaged in war in Afghanistan and Iraq with vague ideological goals of establishing democracy whereas the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, like the people of South Vietnam, may not view the conflict through the same eyes as Americans. The film is beautifully filmed. Kubrick was the finest film maker for interior scenes and the barracks on Parris Island, with their red shiny floors, created a perfect stage for the drama to unfold between the drill sergeant and the new troops. The bombed out buildings for the final scenes were fascinating, a labyrinth of death and danger. The acting was absolutely superb with Private Lawrence giving one of the most frightening performances while the Drill Sergeant giving one of the most over-the-top performances on film. The film is totally entertaining.</p></body></html>

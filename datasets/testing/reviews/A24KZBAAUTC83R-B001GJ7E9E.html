It is quite obvious why Brad and Angelina are together in real life. Their chemistry here is astounding. Both are at the top of their acting game here. From bad-ass assassins to romping sexuallly through sheer force of willpower and muscle - both are shown with aplomb in this film.<br /><br />Whoever this director is, he is on the right road here. Great action cinematography, along with comedic timing, the director shoots all with pinashe.<br /><br />A must see film.</p></body></html>

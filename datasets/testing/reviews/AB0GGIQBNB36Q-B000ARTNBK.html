What more did you want, Chris evans was spot on as the Human torch, Micheal Chiklis as the thing. The man they got for Mr. Fantastic was spot on, maybe someone different for the invisible woman. But other than that, I'm sorry, you can't get any better than what this movie did, showing them get hit by the cosmic rays in space, this rendition of Dr. Doom is the best I've seen period. What I particularly like about this movie, is that it's not ashamed of being a comic book movie. I've seen people who have said it's not faithful, how so, I guess they enjoyed the movie that came out in the 90's. Oh that's right, Marvel never released it because it was so bad, until a couple of years ago. It's a fun movie, the interplay between Ben grimm, and Johny Storm is spot on. I highly recommend this movie. It is the fantastic four.</p></body></html>

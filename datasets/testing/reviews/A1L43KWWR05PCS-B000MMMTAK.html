<meta name="summary" content="FUNNY AND TOTALLY POLITICALLY INCORRECT..."></head><body><p>This is a creative and funny film that is simply not for everyone, as it contains material that is bound to offend someone. It is a quasi mockumentary, cinema verite style flick. Sasha Baron Cohen plays the character of Borat Sagdiyev, a journalist from the eastern European, third world country of Kazakhstan.<br /><br />Borat travels to the United States to learn American culture and film his experiences in order to bring back his new found knowledge to the masses in Kazakhstan. Along his journey, he interacts with real people with hilarious and eyebrow raising consequences. Borat always stays in character, which means he is alternately offensive and ignorant. Some of the Americans with whom he interacts raise a few eyebrows themselves.<br /><br />There are moments in the film are simply startling and totally outrageous. Others are even amazingly funny. There certainly are scenes in the film that rise to the level of social commentary, while others are simply sophomoric. Still, the film cannot help but entertain those who view the film without pre-conceived notions.  This is one film where I was either laughing my head off or staring at the screen open-mouthed, as I watched the misadventures of Borat in America.</p></body></html>

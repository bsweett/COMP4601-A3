"The Green Mile" is more than just a Stephen King tale (in fact, it's hardly that at all); it's an epic character study, a human drama told against a backdrop of cruelty and violence. Another masterful collaboration between King and "Shawshank Redemption" director Frank Darabont, the movie represents some of the best work of everyone involved -- especially star Tom Hanks.<p>Over the last decade, Hanks has become our greatest living actor. His work in "Forrest Gump," "Saving Private Ryan," "Road to Perdition," "Cast Away" and "Catch Me If You Can" proves his name worth mentioning with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. He can effortlessly transform himself into whatever character he plays, yet still remain "Tom Hanks." His best acting may be in "The Green Mile."<p>As 1930s prison guard Paul Edgecomb, Hanks gradually unveils a wealth of sensitivity beneath an exterior hardened by life on Death Row. Another actor might have killed the role with treacly sentimentality, but Hanks focuses on Paul's tough, sturdy integrity. Only in his more private moments does he reveal second thoughts about his job, making the character all the more compelling.<p>Darabont did a sensational job directing this movie. What's amazing is that he left so much of King's original story intact; one could easily imagine the studio ordering so many cuts and trims and alterations that it would hardly make sense anymore. But I can't think of a thing that could have been cut that would have improved the film by its absence. Surely we could do without so many details of Paul's urinary tract infection, but look at the expression on Hanks's face as he whizzes for the first time without awful pain. We feel his relief, and understand pretty much everything he does after that point.<p>"The Green Mile" contains excellent performances from an expert supporting cast. I loved everybody in the movie, from David Morse and Doug Hutchison (as the despicable Percy) to Bonnie Hunt and Sam Rockwell (as a foul-mouthed, truly loathsome killer). Michael Clark Duncan deserved his Oscar nomination for his empathetic portrayal of John Coffey -- but then Hanks also deserved a nod, for which he was unfairly overlooked.<p>The movie is hard and unflinching in its look at death by electric chair. These scenes are grueling without being exploitative; Darabont gets his point across without turning the movie into "Faces of Death." Darabont (and his surrogate Hanks) treats the condemned men with the utmost reverence and respect, allowing each a chance for redemption. The most harrowing scene in the film is Paul's realization that he may be executing an innocent man -- worse, a man blessed with the healing powers of God, and that the fires of hell may be stoked for him, as well.<p>The movie never tells us whether Paul himself receives deliverance. His own long walk -- an unnaturally extended life --becomes a form of punishment. We are left with so much to ponder at the end of "The Green Mile." It is worth every minute of its running time, and is now one of my all-time favorite films.</p></body></html>

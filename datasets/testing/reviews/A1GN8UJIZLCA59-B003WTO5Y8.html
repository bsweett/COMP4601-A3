The first scene between Lecter and Jody Foster's ambitious but green FBI agent Clarice Starling in which Clarice tries to get Lecter to help in the FBI's search for a serial killer dubbed Buffalo Bill is a movie classic.  Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Foster create a dramatic tension as the brilliant but deranged Lecter psychoanalyzes Clarice.  Ms. Foster's facial reactions to Lecter's analysis convey so much more than words.  The movie is a psychological thriller that provides chills, tension and scares you while avoiding tired cliches.  In addition to Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Foster, Ted Levine is scary as the twisted killer Buffalo Bill and Scott Glenn is icy as Clarice's commanding officer. Director Jonathan Demme strikes all right notes and the filming of the closing scene in Buffalo Bill's basement is superbly filmed.  The Silence of the Lambs became just the third movie in history to win Best Picture, Best Actor (Mr. Hopkins), Best Actress (Ms. Foster), Best Director and Best Screenplay in the same year.</p></body></html>

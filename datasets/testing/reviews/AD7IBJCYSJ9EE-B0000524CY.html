<meta name="summary" content="A blood-chilling tale..."></head><body><p>I wrote a review for this once, but a lot of people hated it and even I hated it! So I'm going to write a new review for this movie.<br /><br /> "The Exorcist is about the demon, "Pazuzu" possesing 12-year old Regan McNeil. When she starts acting weird, Regan's mom takes her to get a check-up. The doctors find nothing wrong with her. Soon, she gets more possesed, saying a stream of swear words and doing supernatural things. Mom calls for some priests to drive Pazuzu out of her. There's a lot more to the story, but I want not to spoil it all.<br /><br /> The Exorcist is very spooky. One thing that chills my blood is when they find, "Help me" written on possesed Regan's chest. What chills me about that is the freaky "music" that you hear when you see it. Very chilling if you turn the volume up.<br /><br /> This movie is also filled with disturbing images. One that is disturbing is when Regan stabs herself in the v@gina with a crusfix saying, "Let Jesus $^$^ you!!!" Another disturbing image is when Regan spiderwalks down the stairs and blood pours out of her mouth.<br /><br /> During the movie, a face appears for about a few seconds. It has white skin, ugly yellow teeth, and blood-shot eyes. It appears about 4 times during the movie. Can you find them all?<br /><br /> The DVD features could have been better. Some trailers, [not for the original version] a commentary, [ all he does is tell the story. Nothing else] and some other stuff.<br /><br /> I have not seen the original version, only TVYNS. I might just see the original, though.<br /><br /> You can buy this and its sequels together at a Walmart for about 20$. So get them, NOW!</p></body></html>

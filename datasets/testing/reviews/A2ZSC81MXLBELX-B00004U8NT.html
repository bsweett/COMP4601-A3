<meta name="summary" content="When You Wish Upon a Star........"></head><body><p>This Review refers to the newly released (Aug 2002) Single Disc Collectors Edition of this film (columbia)......<br /> So you have either seen this film and you love it, or by some chance have never seen it and want to see what all the fuss was about.In either case you are trying to decide which edition to buy. I'm not here to make up your mind for you (it was a tough enough decision for me) just to let you know that this DVD was one of the most enjoyable I've watched lately...First a little about the story though.<br />  This Sci-Fi tale of UFO's is more like a fairy tale.Roy Neary(Richard Dreyfuss) is a regular guy, living an ordinary maybe not so happy life with his wife(Teri Garr)and kids. On a routine run in his Utility truck one night, something extrordinary happens to him. He is witness to bright lights which turn out to be UFO's. He becomes obsessed with the visitors,as do others who have witnessed the same. He befreinds Jillian(Melinda Dillon), who's little boy was abducted by the ship. They are drawn to the site that the Ufo's have communicated to scientists, through musical tones,where they will meet. There is a hugh gathering of all these men of science,as they wait for something, anything to happen. Roy looks on, just thrilled to be a part of it all.. Without giving away too much (for those who have not seen it), I will tell you that we are treated to the most wonderful and touching scenes of the "encounter".John Williams score, and  "When you wish upon a star" being played throughout really adds to the viewing and listening pleasure.<br />  Steven Spielberg has presented us with a gift of a tale that can be enjoyed by families for many years to come. You will never tire of this story.<br />  Okay Okay! so the DVD.....As I said before it was one of the most enjoyable DVD's I've watched. It's Digitally mastered. As far as audio there is set ups for dolby digital 5.1 as well as 5.1 DTS, also one for 2 channel surround, so whatever system you have you should be real happy with the sound. I felt like I was in the theatre. The picture is the sharpest I've ever seen it. It's in widescreen (anamorphic) and remastered in high defination. There are several languages for subtitles if needed.<br />There are no other extra features(Behind the scenes, or interviews), Just a Class-A treatment for a Class-A movie.<br />"We are not alone".................Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<br />for Spielberg fans:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DZ3I5">Saving Private Ryan/Amistad</a><br />for sci-fi/horror fans:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157297110X">Sci-Fi Channel Trivia Book</a></p></body></html>

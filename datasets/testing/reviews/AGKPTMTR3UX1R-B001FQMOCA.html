Starting out from Arkansas as a ne'er do well, Cash does a brief stint in the Air Force and works as a door-to-door salesman before taking his amateur band into Nashville's legendary Sun Records to take his first steps on the road to stardom.<br /><br />Playing in a succession of honky-tonks, school gyms, and other seedy venues, Cash hones his craft on endless and huge road tours in the company of such other rising stars as Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Elvis Presley. His growing popularity with his female fans puts breaking strains on his marriage. Along the way, he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) of the famous Carter family. The two begin a tempestuous on-again off-again relationship that is punctuated by Johnny's bouts of heavy drinking, amphetamine abuse and womanizing, as well as June's emotional travail at being an absent twice-divorced mother of two young girls.<br /><br />Witherspoon, known for her fluffy comedies, won the Best Actress Oscar for devouring the scenery as the deep, emotionally complex, feisty but firm June Carter, who refuses Cash's constant entreaties to marry him, argues him into responsibility, drops him when his behavior goes over the line, and is there absolutely as Johnny battles his demons, kicks the amphetamines, and at last confronts his vicious father. Cash finally walks the line, mostly because of Carter. More than lovers, the two are best friends.<br /><br />Although Phoenix did not win Best Actor for Cash, his performance is on a par with Witherspoon's. Starting out a bit tentatively, Phoenix's portrayal of Cash gains freight-train momentum as the film progresses, until at the end, Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash. His concert at Folsom Prison is electrifying and profoundly real.<br /><br />Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the songs, and do it amazingly well. Their performance reaches its crescendo at the close of the film, when Johnny proposes (for the seventieth time) to June onstage in Ontario, and she at last says yes.<br /><br />Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash remained married from 1968 until their deaths, weeks apart, in 2003. Loving best friends, they stayed together even then.</p></body></html>

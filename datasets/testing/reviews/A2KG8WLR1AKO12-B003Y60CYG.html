<meta name="summary" content="This is a fun movie to watch---especially if you are a Garrison Keillor fan"></head><body><p>I found Robert Altman's last film to be delightful.  The singing was quite good and the story line is easy to follow. Woody Harrelson was particularly entertaining as a singer.  This movie may not be for everybody.  Still, anyone who even mildly enjoys the humor of Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion should obtain a copy.  Five stars?  Not quite, but four and a half stars guarantees it to be worth investing a few hours of your time.  And yes, these well known actors truly seem to enjoy themselves.  Working on this movie set was likely a lot of fun and the laughter never-ending.</p></body></html>

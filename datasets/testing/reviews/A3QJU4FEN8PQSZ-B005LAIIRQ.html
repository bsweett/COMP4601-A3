<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing unless you view it from another angle"></head><body><p>I was disappointed. Why? The Grey had been touted as an action thriller. One reviewer extolled its amazing crash scene. These are pure lies.<br /><br />First, the crash scene. You don't really see much, just flashes of what's happening. I wouldn't get all excited about its supposed realism.<br /><br />Next, the action. Here's where it is a serious disappointment if you went into this (as I did) expecting something along the lines of The Edge. The "action" is nothing much. Characters get killed randomnly, one by one, whether by wolves, falls, etc. There's no logic to it, no smart, resourceful comebacks (except maybe one, making a boom-stick). It's just "we have to keep moving". Those who can't or don't, die. Some deaths are more creative than others, but not by much. This is not "action". It's more like another sequel of Final Destination.<br /><br />So, why all the rave reviews?<br /><br />Well, you have to watch it from another vantage point - Liam as The Grey, too. We see this mirrored in the movie. As the alpha wolf puts down a challenger, Ottway, too, must defend his alpha status. Starting off as suicidal, The Grey Outdoors makes Ottway struggle to live. Others - well, just one, really - die from losing that will to survive. (Actually, the others die, as I said, randomly. Not much in the way of intelligent plot there.)<br /><br />Does this really save the movie? Not a whole lot.<br /><br />The other thing that may have critics swooning is Ottway's challenge to God to save him, in the face of all the random and senseless death. Of course, there is no heavenly answer - just The Grey Sky. "I'll do it myself," he concludes. All kinds of chatter about how philosophical this is. But is it really? Seriously? He makes a deal with God - if you save me, I'll serve you the rest of my life! Now, it would take a pretty poor philosopher to think that makes any kind of serious point. The same question has been asked in worse times, e.g. the Holocaust, and Gethsemane. The answer is only for serious questioners. (Hints: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCFDPY">Disappointment with God: Three Questions No One Asks Aloud</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310245729">Where Is God When It Hurts?</a>.)<br /><br />"God is not there because terrible things happen"? When people are gassed in Nazi showers? When you are whipped and your back laid open? When a crown of thorns is jammed onto your head and you are beaten repeatedly on that same head and spit upon, perhaps? When you are nailed to a cross with iron spikes? Perhaps, perhaps not ...<br /><br />There is some decent characterization here. We learn why Ottway's wife left him, and why he's suicidal. His "scum of the earth" companions seem like real people. That makes the randomness of their demises more jarring. And I kept wondering why they didn't just burn the trees around them that harbored their predators, but I'm probably just ignorant of tree-burning lore.</p></body></html>

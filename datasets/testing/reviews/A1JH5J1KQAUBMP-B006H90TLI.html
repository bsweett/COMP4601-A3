<meta name="summary" content="A challenging crime film"></head><body><p>An unemployed welder (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the scene of a drug transaction gone wrong and absconds with a suitcase full of cash.  This puts a ruthless killer (Javier Bardem) on his trail.  Meanwhile, an aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) follows in the wake of the many violent encounters that ensue, trying to make sense of what is happening.<br /><br />I'm pleased to see that, as of this writing, so many people have rated this film so highly.  In the theater where I saw it, several people were quite vocally angered by the finale, and I can understand the reason even though I don't share their disappointment.  For much of the film, writer/directors Joel and Ethan Coen give us every reason to believe that we are watching a film that, however exceptional it may be, follows certain conventions of the action genre.  In the end, though, (and I'm trying to be very careful not to give any spoilers) we are denied a key scene that any other action film would have given us, and the focus shifts to the tired sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones.  The theme of the film becomes apparent: the escalating violence accompanying the increase of the drug trade is indeed making the US "no country for old men," but rather a land where the energy and savagery of a new breed of younger criminal may be intensifying the violence of the criminal element to an unprecedented degree.</p></body></html>

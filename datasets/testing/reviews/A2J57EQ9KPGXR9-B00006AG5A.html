<meta name="summary" content="Surprised the heck out of me!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie about three hours before I watched the new Star Wars film and, believe it or not, this film is better.  Surprised?  So was I; I watch this film in a theater that was practically empty, me and 1 other person.  Boy that was fun!  Boy was this film fun!  It was enjoyable from start to finish, not a boring bit in the entire film.  This is a great DVD to own since it translates very well to the small screen.  &quot;The Rock&quot; did a great job, another surprise.  I know it's hard to believe but it's true; watch it for yourself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful film"></head><body><p>This movie might seem campy compared to the reboot done in the 2000's, but I honestly like this film better. Jack Nicholson does a great job as the Joker, and this movie's camp quality is actually enjoyable, it has more of the comic-book feel which really worked since... well, Batman DID come from a comic book! Overall everyone did a really nice job in this film, and it was the beginning of a solid series (well, at least the first two movies in this series were really great)</p></body></html>

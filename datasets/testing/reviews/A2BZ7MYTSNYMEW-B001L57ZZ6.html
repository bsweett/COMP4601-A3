His twin has been murdered and he is forced to do things that he doesn't want to do (by a gentle, female voice on the phone), all with the help of an unwilling, single mother played by Michelle Monaghan. Torn between fear and duty to Country, LaBeouf  and Monaghan, follow a series of steps to unmask who is behind the plots and why. Rosario Dawson and Billy Bob Thornton are wonderful in their support roles as law enforcement officers, who soon begin to believe that everything is not as it seems.<br /><br />While I found the movie entertaining (chase scenes especially) and somewhat exciting, I don't think there was anything too original. This plot, the "Big Brother/Artificial Intelligence" gone mad concept, has been done several times before (Stealth, I-Robot, Terminator, Minority Report, Transformers, etc), and this one really didn't have anything new. Although the computer supposedly gained "intelligence" or at least began making decisions based on what "it" thought was best for the country, there still should have been more of a fail safe on the system in place. Now don't get me wrong, I am personally intrigued by artificial intelligence (in movies usually something that we mere humans have created) that "realizes itself" and attempts to erase mankind for the betterment of all. Terminator, for example, was the perfect balance between "artificial intelligence and realization" because they looked human but feel that the world would be a better place without us, while the computer generated female voice felt that our world would be a better place with a different President and Cabinet. I think it was a decent movie, I just wish it had been better.</p></body></html>

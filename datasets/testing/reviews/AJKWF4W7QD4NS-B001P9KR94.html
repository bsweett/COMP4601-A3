From Shallow Grave, to Trainspotting, to 28 Days Later, to Millions, to Sunshine; he's always managed to deliver visually striking, hypnotic, and intelligent films.  Slumdog Millionaire has proved to be Boyle's most celebrated film yet, as the Oscar darling has captured the hearts and minds of viewers across the globe.  As a fan of Boyle's work, I can honestly say that I'm not in love with it as much as everyone else seems to be, but that aside, Slumdog Millionaire remains a powerful film that should be seen whether you be a Boyle fan or not.  With all the attention it has received, going into the film's storyline would only seem redundant at this point, but what I will say is that Slumdog Millionaire finds Boyle at his technical best.  The editing, sound design, and music are beautifully done, and the film manages to keep a kinetic pace throughout its two hour running time as well.  All in all, while I don't think Slumdog Millionaire was quite the masterpiece that a majority of viewers do, it is a powerful, engaging, and incredibly compelling work that will stay with you after the credits roll, and is by all means definitely worth seeing.</p></body></html>

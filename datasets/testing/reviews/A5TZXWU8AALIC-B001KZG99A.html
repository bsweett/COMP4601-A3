<meta name="summary" content="Even In Our Super Hero Glut, This is a Great Movie"></head><body><p>Now that all of our summer blockbusters have become nothing but comic book super heroes, some of them still deliver a great time.<br /><br />IRON MAN is one of them.<br /><br />I used to get Iron Man comics as a kid but he wasn't as popular and iconic as Superman or Batman.  In fact, I can't remember any of the villains from his comics, but he had a cool suit and the artwork was as topnotch as the best of Marvel during the 70s.<br /><br />The film version definitely has as much to offer as the best of the super hero movie.  The script is tight, the characters are fleshed out, the humor is funny and genuine, the special effects and production values are topnotch.  Robert Downey Jr. brings a lot to the role of Tony Stark and you almost believe the role was written just for him.<br /><br />IRON MAN leaves you wanting more.  And since it made a gigantic pile of money, I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him.<br /><br />Be sure to stick around for a short scene following the end credits (this past summer's THE INCREDIBLE HULK also featured a post-credits scene of Tony Stark popping up as well!).<br /><br />And, was it just me, or did everyone think that was Kris Kristofferson every time Jeff Bridges showed up?</p></body></html>

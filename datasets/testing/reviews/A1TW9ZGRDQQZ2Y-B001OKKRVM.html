I have heard good things about it and I was already getting bored with my relatives, so I popped in the DVD. The first thing you will hear is the excellent narration by Morgan Freeman (great choice) followed by the scenery that doesn't seem real. It is so amazing how this movie was filmed without interfering with the animals. It's like your right there with them, and by the time the film is over, you really feel like you know these magnificent birds as though they were human. After viewing this film, I will never complain about having a rough life or look at a penguin the same way again. If there is such a thing as reincarnation, please God, don't have me come back as a penguin. I hate the cold!</p></body></html>

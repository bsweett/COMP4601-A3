<meta name="summary" content="An A++ War Movie With A Touch of Humanity"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson has been type-casted as the leading hero for movies such as "Braveheart" (which he directed, produced, acted), "The Patriot" & for "We Were Soldiers", he snugged in the role comfortably.  For this offering, he rejoined with Randall Wallace, who penned "Braveheart".  This time, Randall Wallace took the helm, & perhaps, he's been given more flexibility by Mel's film company, Icon Production, & therefore, "We Were Soldiers" was able to shine whereas "Pearl Harbour" wouldn't match.  One of Randall's forte was to give us a glimpse of humanity at work in the war that United States shouldn't be involved at the first place.  For the first time, Vietnamese was shown a matching fighter against US' military might.  We were also brought into the realm of the armies' families witnessing first-hand the wives' initial denial but eventual acceptance of the demise of their husbands (& fathers of their children).  Their greivance were heart-felt & for the first time, we were shown perspective of both Americans & Vietnamese.  I sincerely believe that this movie covered a lot of ground such as bringing to our attention that in a war, it's irrelevant what races they are.  The soldiers are brothers in arms, & they are fighting the war as Americans & therefore, in time of dire needs, it's their duty to look after one another.  The movie questioned the need of fighting someone else's war, & brought to surface the treatment of soldiers when they returned from Vietnam, friendly fire.  In the end, when we were shown the Memorial at Washington by Maya Lin then, we would start to appreciate the poignancy but continuing legacy of America's foreign policy.  Highly recommended but not for the faint-hearted.  It's good to see Madeline Stowe back to the silver screen again, & the leading lady from TV series, Felicity acting in a feature movie, & what a display of talent from Nina from 3rd Rock from the Sun.  Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, & other supporting cast were simply splendid</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The goriest but not the worst...not really"></head><body><p>I'm not even going to consider recent films like Hostel, the Hills Have Eyes and Saw films "horror". It's more like a demented version of a slasher film. These films in essence rely on buckets of gore to scare their audience but therein lies the rub: it doesn't scare. Instead what it does is create a feeling of disgust, a "eww!" or a cringe rather than chill you to the bone and make you lose sleep. While I'll admit Saw was a pretty good film for what it was, on subsequent viewings it did fall apart and Saw II was just awful. Saw 3 is more in spirit to 1 but it's also filled with flaws from both.<br /><br />A bit more ambitious in scope, we follow 2 threads: Lynn, a doctor, is taken in by Amanda and Jigsaw because Jigsaw's tumor is getting worse and he wants to be alive to see the end of his next game. In another thread, Jeff, haunted by the death of his son, is not being tortured but what's tested is his need for revenge: he meets people that are strapped into torture devices and he has to get them out. Of course, in the world of Saw, it's not that simple.<br /><br />Be forewarned: this is definately the goriest film the series has seen. Does it work? Kind of. The victims are dispatched in unbelievably gruesome ways but rather than let your imagination take over, we see everything so nothing is left to wonder about. While it does make you cringe, especially one scene involving surgery, it doesn't really scare you to the point where you get goosebumps but rather you're hoping your dinner doesn't come up. Luckily the film has enough of other things to take your mind off it rather than just mindlessly putting in gore for the sake of it(I'm looking at you Hostel).<br /><br />How's the story and everything else? It's actually better. While there is plotholes and inconsistencies and whatnot, it's also a bit more better written and being able to juggle various stories, including scenes that involve the first 2 flims are fun so this is much better than part 2. Will we get a more super-duper version later on? I don't see how. We have all the gore we need, 3 commentaries and featurettes so what else needs to be shown? Although to capitalize on the inevitable Saw IV, we'll probably get another.<br /><br />I don't know if you'll want to buy it unless you love this stuff but give it a rent then make your decision then. Me? I liked it, far from loved but I wouldn't want to own it.</p></body></html>

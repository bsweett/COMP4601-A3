Yeah, that is my own innner child screaming for some innate understanding of the particulars of a movie, as opposed to blanket generalities, and for a lax reviewer I suppose that is a bias. Well so be it. The only saving grace in the movie was when Cusack, who is bland, detached and feverishly boring, orders a double Patron chilled. High fives on the couch abounded after that remark.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson. Tsk, tsk, tsk. How painful to watch him in anything. If he ever did anything good, it was because the people that he was sharing the screen with had the talent. He just shined off them. Go ahead and think about it. If his performances in the Star Wars films wasn't enough to send him a check to personally have him never to appear on the big screen again, we have this ersatz for talent appearing as a hotel manager, who is not in the least disturbingly scary. One would think, save wooden and pretentiously arrogant in most roles, he would have made the viewer all the more wary of having Cusak's character actually enter 1408. I mean there is this huge set up now about not entering the room, that charge that a REALLY REALLY good director, like well ya know, DePalma, Kubrick, Demme, would have made tres important, so that myself, and perhaps others, could really get the hairs on our arms doing backflips in anticipation of the horrors that await. He (Jackson) sounded like a Port Authority voice on the PA System. Mundane, reciting and ordinary. Five Stars for the dvd art at best.</p></body></html>

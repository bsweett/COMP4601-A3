<meta name="summary" content="All Star cast = 5 star western"></head><body><p>The combination of Eastwood, Hackman , Freeman and Harris make this one of the greatest westerns ever filmed. The Acting, Script and Cinematography are superior to almost any western I can think of. Great story with plenty of tension, action and memorable lines. Eastwood's best work in my opinion but Gene Hackman steals the film as the hardnosed sheriff of Big Whiskey, Wyoming.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Godzilla" Enters The 21st Century"></head><body><p>"The Host" reminded me of those Godzilla movies I enjoyed watching as a child.  Godzilla began his long, illustrious career as a bad lizard but later became a good guy when he battled giant, grotesque creatures, such as the Smog Monster, that were the products of man's pollution.  The special effects have improved since the sixties and seventies, but we still know the voices are dubbed.  The plot for "The Host" is just as comical and unrealistic as the Godzilla movies, but the heart pounding excitement during the creature attacks remains the same.<br /><br />  Most of the excitement, unfortunately, takes place near the beginning of the movie.  Once in a while we are treated with a creature attack but they are few and far between.  Family loss keeps the action moving.  A family's loss over their daughter/niece/granddaughter who was snatched by the creature and taken beneath the water.  However, there is light at the end of the tunnel (or sewer in this case) when the father receives a cell phone message from his daughter and the search begins.  The family must battle military police and doctors as they escape a quarantine and race for the sewers beneath a bridge where the creature was last seen.  There are moments of humor throughout the movie to prevent it from becoming too dark and depressing.<br /><br />  It is interesting to watch a foreign film, especially a horror one involving a monster.  However, the closed captions for the DVD did not match what the actors were speaking in English.  Neither did the English subtitles which, I assumed, were a more precise translation for the Korean language.<br /><br />  I would have given this movie four stars if there had been other creature attacks on large groups of people, such as a bus or a small cruise boat on the Han River.  The ending was disappointing.  Don't expect one that will shock and horrify you.  It ended on a rather dull, mundane note.  However, I do recommend watching this movie if you a fan of the nostalgic Godzilla movies, creature features, or "nature gone wild." genre.</p></body></html>

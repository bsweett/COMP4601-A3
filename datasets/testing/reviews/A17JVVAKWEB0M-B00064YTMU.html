<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie, but I wanted to like it more"></head><body><p>In an opening scene worthy of its own film, "Collateral" introduces its audience to a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) who would rather be doing anything else in the world than driving cabs.  Max sees driving a cab as beneath him; he dreams of a life of importance and seems to feel the need to apologize to his passengers for doing what he does to make a living.<br /><br />Max then picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) and promises to chauffeur the well-dressed businessman around for the remainder of the evening.  When Vincent begins killing people at each stop, the film becomes a struggle between the two individuals: a contract killer and the cabbie driving him to each murder.  In a narrative similar to what could be expected of a low budget play, much of the action takes place in the cab, as the two men bicker and debate while an unbelievable set of circumstances unfolds around them.<br /><br />The film's strength is found in the performances of its two leads and in the unequaled craftsmanship of its director (Michael Mann).  Foxx and Cruise -each cast against type- give performances that rival anything in their pasts.  Foxx shows he can tone down his persona, nailing the cerebral Max, while Cruise continues his recent trend of trying to "muddy up" his good boy image.<br /><br />Mann's direction is nothing short of spectacular.  Working with material that could have resulted in a corny, tired formula film in the hands of a lesser director, Mann is able to create a film that expands the potential for a crime drama.  He opens up the genre with ambiguous questions on the nature of killing and decorates the scenes with haunting, dark images.<br /><br />"Collateral" is not the best film of 2004.  In fact, the material leaves a lot to be desired.  But this film shows how talented individuals can turn a less-than-desirable script into a wholly enjoyable film.  Without Mann, Foxx and Cruise, this film could have been a disaster; but with them in charge, the end product is a film that will satisfy most viewers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A pleasantly surprising, fun, action film"></head><body><p>The Green Hornet seemed like it was fighting an uphill battle as soon as it went into development. Most projects that were either influenced by Bruce Lee or are trying to continue a story he started just turn out to have disappointing and unfortunate results. The Green Hornet lost Stephen Chow shortly after it was announced he would direct and star in the film while many didn't think Seth Rogen was the type of guy who could do an action film. The main villain role was originally intended for Nicolas Cage before he eventually dropped out. With its release continually being pushed back and critic and early screening reception being practically nonexistent many wondered if The Green Hornet could just pull off not being a total disaster. Despite all of its issues, The Green Hornet is actually an extremely humorous and entertaining thrill ride.<br /><br />Stephen Chow was replaced with Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunsine of the Spotless Mind, Be Kind Rewind) and his unusually artistic and spectacular visual style does get put on display on more than one occasion. Two of Kato's fight sequences, Britt's thought process in the Chinese restaurant, and the screen being split into multiple segments after a bounty is put on The Green Hornet's head are all great examples. Gondry usually manipulates scenes in extraordinary ways. In Kato's fight scenes, one car suddenly becomes a dozen while floating heads transition one scene to the next while Britt is in the restaurant. The great thing is his style works really well within the world of The Green Hornet.<br /><br />The cast is a serious plus, as well. Seth Rogen brings a lot of the comedy he's become associated with, but juggles the action aspect fairly well. Rogen isn't exactly a stranger to action as Pineapple Express had its fair share of it. I seriously loved Pineapple Express, so him being The Green Hornet wasn't as bothersome to me as it was to others. Jay Chou is no Bruce Lee, but he's an entertaining Kato nonetheless. There were a few smaller roles that are worth keeping an eye out for. Edward Furlong is around long enough for you to say to yourself, "Wasn't that the kid from Terminator 2 and American History X?" Indeed it was, sir or madam. Indeed it was. James Franco shows up and gives a hell of a speech, as well. After seeing him in something like 127 Hours, it's amazing seeing him not only jump back and forth between genres but give such exceptional performances in everything he's a part of. Then there's Christoph Waltz whose Chudnofsky character seems to be just as fun as Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. Chudnofsky is funny in a twisted kind of way, maniacal, and misunderstood by everyone around him while Waltz seems to slip into the character with ease.<br /><br />One of the more interesting and unexpected aspects of the film was the way certain things in the film were connected. Only the simpler things seem to come to mind now; Britt being interested in saving people at an early age, how The Green Hornet name comes to fruition, the one thing Kato can't do, and DA Scanlon's true motives. It all just comes together really nicely while little things are connected to the big picture and revealed later on. The Green Hornet isn't the best written piece of film, but everything flows really well and is put together in a way that'll surprise many who expect this to be nothing more than popcorn entertainment. There's even a brief nod to Bruce Lee in there.<br /><br />If you hadn't noticed, Cameron Diaz has yet to be mentioned in this review. While her character is important to the storyline, Diaz isn't. Anybody could have filled her shoes. When she first shows up on screen, the woman next to me said out loud, "What's she doing here?" It was pretty hilarious since I was pretty much thinking the same thing. She doesn't have much screen time either. Christoph Waltz was around more yet she received top billing after Rogen and Chou. It just seems kinda weak even if she is the bigger star.<br /><br />The film gets kind of rough towards the end though when it comes to special effects. While certain ridiculous things are shown in a light that almost make some of them seem feasible, the CG and green screen work is really noticeable during the conclusion of the story. It doesn't necessarily ruin the film, but it hurts it a little.<br /><br />The Green Hornet is really a hell of a way to kick off the new year as far as movies go. It's an amusing and exhilarating thrill ride from beginning to end while its solid and well-rounded cast in addition to the film having a surprisingly well-written storyline is just icing on the cake. The Green Hornet is just a fun film that can pretty much be recommended to anyone. So the next time someone asks if The Green Hornet is actually a good film, be sure you reply by saying, "That's a bingo!" (sorry, I had to)</p></body></html>

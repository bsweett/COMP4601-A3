<meta name="summary" content="Globetrotting Action"></head><body><p>Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie, brings the popular video game to the big screen to fine results.<p>THE STORY:<p>Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider, must search the world for a mysterious relic that holds to key to controlling time and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>For fans of the video games, Jolie's depiction of Lara Croft is just amazing.  It really does feel like the game come to life with the mysterious locales, mysterious artifacts, treacherous monsters and rival tomb raiders.  Easily the main driver of this movie is it's myriad of action sequences and the awesome special FX.  The cool background story of "a Father and Daughter's Love that Defies Time" is another cool aspect to the film.<p>BEST SCENES:<p>1. The Mansion Battle<p>2. The Battle in the Cambodia Temple<p>3. The Last Fight Scene<p>THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS<p>All cool things aside, the storyline takes a major backseat to the action here however.  The rough gist of the story was Lara's need to prevent the time control device from falling into the wrong hands but to be honest, the actual storytelling gets quite confusing and if you blink for a minute you'll probably miss a lot of the story development.  The movie itself moves at a frantic pace and if not paying attention carefully you'll definitely miss out on some key plot developments (such as why are we suddenly in this particular locale).  Don't feel too bad though, it's the poor storytelling and not your lack of attentiveness.<p>That being said though, you're more than likely watching this movie for the eye candy (action, FX and Lara Croft) and not the brilliant storytelling.<p>THE DVD EXTRAS:<p>Like most action film DVDs of late, what the movie lacks is MORE than made up for in the awesome extras package of the DVD.  Among the cornucopia of awesome goodies in this batch are:<p>1. "Crafting Lara Croft" - 7 minute featurette about Angelina Jolie's extensive martial arts and weapons training to prepare for her role as Lara Croft.  Cool stuff.  Remind me not to mess with her...<p>2. Director's Audio Commentary Track - Always insightful<p>3. 4 Deleted Scenes - Some good, some alright<p>4. "Stunts" - 8 minute featurette about how some of the action stunts (particularly the<br />Mansion battle scene) were filmed.<p>5. "Digging Into Tomb Raider" - 25 minute feature that talks about the entire movie including it's video game origins, the stunts, Jolie's training as well as shooting on location in Cambodia and Greenland.<p>6. Music Video - "Elevation" by U2<p>7. "Are You Game?" - 8 minute featurette that talked about the Tomb Raider games and how they translated the game to the big screen.<p>8. Alternate Main Title Sequence<p>9. Visual FX - Several mini featurettes on how they filmed all the big Special FX scenes in the movie.  Cool stuff!!!<p>THE VERDICT:<p>While the story and storytelling may be pretty lacking, this film DOES deliver the goods in spades in terms of action and FX so viewers will be pleased in the action category and the story is easy enough to follow along and get the "basic gist" of if nothing else.<p>For fans of the Tomb Raider games you'll be pleased with the rendering of everyone's favorite action heroine and the DVD extras provide some awesome insight into the world of Lara Croft.<p>Overall, action fanatics should be pleased with this film which is great for a rental or a purchase.  The awesome DVD extras make it a solid addition to your collection if you're so inclined.<p>GRADES:<p>The Movie:  3 ? stars<br />The DVD Extras:  5 stars<br />Overall:  4 ? stars<p>Recommended</p></body></html>

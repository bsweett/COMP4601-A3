Sleven turns out to be a movie all its' own.  After a flashback to a time 25 years earlier, a present day case of mistaken identity leaves Harnett in debt to two rival mob bosses--Freeman and Kingsley.  Freeman wants Kingsely's gay son dead, so he is willing to erase the debt if it is done.  Meanwhile, master assassin Willis is a man for hire, but who is he really working for.  A lot of twists and turns fill this story.  When you see how it all comes together at the end, you will be surprised and fullfilled.  This is a good movie to check out.</p></body></html>

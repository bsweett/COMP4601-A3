In short, he could have made a Chuck Norris movie.<br /><br />But Spielberg was after something different, a film that is not only a tense thriller, but also explores more fully dimensional characters and what the effects of this type of violence has on the participants. Going beyond a simple revenge plot shoot-em-up required courage and I applaud that.  But delving deeper has the result of making more obvious the strengths and weaknesses of such an exercise.<br /><br />Surely it is no stretch of the imagination to believe that the men carrying out such a mission, which by its nature must be cold-blooded, would be affected by their actions over time.  They are being good soldiers, true, but this is off the battlefield, and by definition does not allow passion and fervor to rule.  Believing or even knowing your actions are righteous, to carry out executions in the form of calculated murder would wear on any men, lest they be monsters.<br /><br />The greatest strength of the film is in depicting the difficulty faced by some of the team in doing close-up, face-to-face killing.  Spielberg shows us the nasty, brutal horror of violent death, even when "deserved".  There are no Rambo-like happy explosions or shootings.  Human beings are being killed, and even if they are bad and guilty of their own heinous crimes, their deaths aren't pretty.  Even when the act seems justified, neither his characters nor we, the audience, are allowed to bask in self-righteousness about the sordid death of another bad player.  It just isn't that simple.<br /><br />But having raised the question about the consequences of setting out on a path of well-motivated vengeance and the cycle of violence it may engender, Spielberg runs into trouble providing any alternatives or answers.  What else could Israel have done?  Ignore the murder of their athletes?  How do you successfully counter implacable and unremitting hatred directed at you?  Can you afford the luxury of trying to "understand" someone who wants to kill you? Or is the cycle of violence and revenge inevitable until both sides exhaust themselves?  These are questions that face this nation today, and I don't know the answer and neither does Steven.<br /><br />In the end when Avner says to Ephraim "Why not arrest them, like Eichmann?" It is a pathetic answer to these disturbing questions. The Eichmann kidnapping to Israel was a one-of-a-kind operation, and possible because he thought he was safe and hidden. Against Black September, it would have been nearly impossible, and even possibly more violent. Having watched the Germans casually release the 3 Olympic terrorists they held to end another hijacking, I doubt trust in jail terms would be high on the agenda. Hell, the Olympic athletes were taken hostage and eventually murdered over the demand for release of Palestinian prisoners already in Israeli jails!<br /><br />At any rate, I find this film admirable for its depiction of the soul-numbing result of violence, even violence you can justify.  That Spielberg and Tony Kushner get a bit lost in trying to achieve an over-arching theme or resolution to this dilemma is not surprising, as this is the problem of our age and every age that went before us.  If the only answer to a violent act is an even more violent response, and it may well be, than the human race has a long and sorrowful future ahead of us.  This is not a political opinion, this is a cry from the heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A trip to the island (Arbeit macht frie)"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time.  It is certainly the best Michael Bay movie since THE ROCK.  It's also the most "cerebral" film I've ever seen Bay do.  The ensemble cast is fantastic, featuring Steve Buscemi, Sean Bean, Ewan McGregor and the stunningly gorgeous Scarlett Johannson.  Djimon Hounsou proves that he is much more than an impressive physique (although I've always thought him a good actor in movies like AMISTAD and GLADIATOR, anyway).<br /><br />In addition to the cast and direction, the story itself is captivating and it's very, very relevant to our times.  It examines the consequences of taking the extreme end of one side of medical ethics.  What this movie reminded me was of a cross between LOGAN'S RUN and BRAVE NEW WORLD, with a science fiction twist in the plot.<br /><br />As such, there is a wider & deeper theme of social engineering / manipulation that has nothing to do with medical ethics & everything to do with how much we can trust our government.  How much of what our politicians say is true actually IS true?  How worthy are the people in Washington of our trust?  This is a trenchant question in this day & age of world chaos and corrupt politicians.<br /><br />Of course, there is also a subtle satire on the concept of religion buried in the tapestry of the story.  In this respect it is much like LOGAN'S RUN.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a good action movie that is also a science fiction movie that has a great cast & is well done, this one is for you.  Just remember:  Arbeit macht frie!</p></body></html>

Okay, and also, the acting is great, and the thrills and suspense of this movie are top-notch. The characters are good, and the way they play out is great. The reason I only give this movie 3 out of 5 stars is because of the ending. I won't spoil it for anyone just in case you haven't seen it, I'm just gonna say that it was such a heart-wrenching gut-punch, it was just so... Man. The ending is really one of the only things this movie differs from the short story in. Man, that ending... Good or bad? You decide. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Blood Diamond" Is Flawed, But Still Worth Having for Two Excellent Performances"></head><body><p>The screenplay of "Blood Diamond" may not be the best of the year, but it is certain that the strong performances from the leading stars are one of the greatest in the year 2006. Like many of the recent films shot in Africa such as "Hotel Rwanda" or "Tsotsi," Edward Zwick's film, which is set against the background of the civil war in Sierra Leone back in 1999, has a strong message or two about the present condition of Africa.<br /><br />The film's story doesn't need a lengthy summery; it is after all about two characters: South African-born mercenary-turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a father and fisherman living in Sierra Leone abducted by a rebel army RUF (Revolutionary United Front). You will see these two people connected by one big, pink rock, a precious diamond hidden somewhere in the land of civil war-torn Sierra Leona.<br /><br />The strongest part of the film is, as I said, the acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, both truly in character. Jennifer Connelly also appears as journalist Maddy Bowen and Arnold Vosloo as "Colonel," but the film belongs to the two, DiCaprio and Hounsou. The locations of Africa are also spectacular and realistic with the photography of Eduardo Serra ("Girl with a Pearl Earring"), something you can see nowhere but in this land.<br /><br />Still I must say "Blood Diamond" is not perfect, like any other films. One weakness is its script with too many coincidences and familiar plot devices. Actions are powerful with guns and explosions, but these actions may be a little too powerful for the film to stress more effectively the immediate and complex issues in Africa. In fact, in "Blood Diamond" you find more than one serious issues - one about diamonds and other natural resources, or about the child soldiers, for instance - but they are overshadowed by the often melodramatic storytelling, which in itself is strong, but could have been better with a more restrained approach.<br /><br />Still "Blood Diamond" shines with two excellent performances. It is flawed, but worth buying now.</p></body></html>

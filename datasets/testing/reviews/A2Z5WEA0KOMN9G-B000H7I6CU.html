<meta name="summary" content="Cool Movie"></head><body><p>I just bought a PlayStation 3 which has a built in bluray player, so I decided to get some bluray movies and this was one of them.  I'd never seen it before.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good.  I liked the story line even though it's a pretty repeated theme.  The effects were pretty good.  The voices in the movie were excellent (even Owen Wilson...whom I don't normally like).<br /><br />The bluray was pretty cool but I was getting the feeling like it was almost too pristine.  When I watch a movie, I expect some cracks and pops from the film (I don't like that but) and this one was perfect.  The cars all looked nice and shiny and the scenery was perfect.  But almost too perfect.<br /><br />Good movie though.</p></body></html>

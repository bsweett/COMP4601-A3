<meta name="summary" content="The movie that made me take notice of Bale"></head><body><p>Christan Bale is one of my favorite actors and even though many conisder his work in Empire Of The Sun to be his breakthrough performance for me it's all about American Psycho. American Psycho was clearly one of the best movies released in the year 2000. The film is a thinking person horror movie and has humor and one of the best portyals of a serial killer in recent years. Mary Harron direction is very good and the performance by Christan Bale is top notch. I highly reccomned American Psycho .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could Use a Ghost Writer"></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage is a comic book fan (Cage took his stage name from Luke Cage, one of the first Black Superheroes. Nick and his wife, Alice Kim Cage, had a son, Kal-el Coppola Cage, named after the comic book character "Kal-el" (aka Superman)) and collector, and a fan of the Ghost Rider comic book in particular; so he really wanted to do this movie. Too bad the director was Mark Steven Johnson, also responsible for Daredevil. Both movies are pretty lame and it makes you wonder if perhaps the comic book based action movie is not Johnson's forte. He made a big mistake in casting a guy to play the young Johnny Blaze who frankly didn't look a thing like a young Nicolas Cage. Hadn't he seen Valley Girl (1983)? Perhaps it was the vanity of Nicolas Cage that pressured him into it, to cut the director some slack, but the guy didn't look like Nicolas Cage at all to the point that it was hard to follow the plot. He looked more like a young Blackheart, the villain who was played by Wes Bentley.<br /><br />I think that there would be two kinds of people that would like this movie if it were done right: Fans of straight-ahead action movies and fans of quirky cult films. In other words, fans of Charlie Kaufman or fans of his twin brother Donald Kaufman (both of whom were played by Nicolas Cage in Adaptation.). I can't speak for the Donald Kaufman fans, but us Charlie Kaufman fans were sorely disappointed. There were numerous moments where opportunities for cool allusions to classic cult films arose, but they were tossed aside like ravaged kleenexes.<br /><br />For starters, Mephistopheles was played by none-other than the Easy Rider himself: Peter Fonda. But Fonda phoned in his portrayal. One of the motorcycles Johnny Blaze rides is based on the Captain America Harley Fonda rode in Rider, but with such a lackluster performance from Peter, who cares? The film opens with expository narration by cult film cowboy Sam Elliott, just as he does in The Big Lebowski (1998). But when he gets fired up to join Johnny Blaze for one last ride his flame peters out before the last round up. What a drag. This would have been a great place to feature Johnny Cash doing Ghost Riders in the Sky, but when they used that song it was by Spiderbait.<br /><br />Cage even did a parody of himself as Sailor in David Lynch's Wild at Heart, but instead of wearing a snake skin jacket which represented a symbol of his individuality, and his belief in personal freedom (this itself is a reference to Marlon Brando as Valentine 'Snakeskin' Xavier in The Fugitive Kind (1959)) and being a huge Elvis Presley fan, Johnny Blaze is a fan of Karen Carpenter?!? Maybe this would be a good place to throw in the fact that Cage IS a big Elvis fan, and, like Michael Jackson, he was once married to Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis? Or how about the fact that Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas (1995)?<br /><br />Eva Mendes didn't win no Oscar, but she did play Denzel Washington's wife in Training Day (2001), and Denzel won an Oscar for that. Whenever I see Eva Mendes I think that she looks like an ethnic version of Cindy Crawford. They both have that beauty mark. Other than that, she doesn't impress me much, and even with Cindy's looks, that wasn't enough to make Crawford herself a movie star. In fact, her nadir and her zenith was probably Fair Game (1995) with William Baldwin. The critics took it as a challenge, feeling that it was fair game to trash the super model who thought she could act.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that popcorn action movie fans might like but not love this tepid adaptation, but quirky cult movie fans will shun it like the plague.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG983M">Kick-Ass</a> (2010)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GJ3BPU">Daredevil</a> (2003)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HMLNOO">Adaptation</a> (2002)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062IVM6">Wild at Heart (Special Edition)</a> (1990)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QBBCMI">Leaving Las Vegas</a> (1995)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLFA">Valley Girl</a> (1983)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014DW3OS">Training Day</a> (2001)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00181JGI2">The Big Lebowski</a> (1998)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI8MPW">Road House</a> (1989)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I8ERVC">Easy Rider</a> (1969)<br /><br />"You're stepping on Karen."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very exciting."></head><body><p>A group of men see their plane go down in an extremely cold climate. The few that survive find themselves dealing with not only the extreme cold, but a pack of hungry wolves. One of the men assumes a leadership role because of his knowledge of the wolves. This is an intense and exciting movie that avoids being a standard action film where characters you don't care about are killed one-by-one. The brutality of the wolves is evident and the efforts of the men to survive are amazing. You will find yourself invested in their determination and saddened when the effort is for naught. This is a good one.</p></body></html>

The movie is slickly made and tension is high throughout. It's an good popcorn muncher that is entertaining, just don't think about it too long afterwards. It's not the worst action film off the year and it's good enough for a few rounds. The DVD transfer looks very good and there are a lot of extras to check out.</p></body></html>

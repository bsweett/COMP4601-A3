<meta name="summary" content="is this REALLY HD?"></head><body><p>Yes, I was disappointed with this release.  Only on occasion does it surpass the standard edition, even with side by side comparisons.  The choice to letterbox the presentation, against Kubrick's intentions, does not jibe with the intent of HD, which is to give you the most accurate presentation of the film on a home video medium.  Hopefully Warner Home Video will revisit this title again in the future and give it the remastering it should have received.</p></body></html>

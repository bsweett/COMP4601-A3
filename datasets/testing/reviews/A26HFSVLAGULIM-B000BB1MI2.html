<meta name="summary" content="NOW WE CAN ALL FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT 1 OF THE GOLD TICKETS WHEN WE SEE TIM BURTON'S RECENT FORAY INTO SOMEWHERE SPECIAL"></head><body><p>FIRST THOUGHTS:<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE THAT ADULTS WILL LIKE AS MUCH AS IT'S AN ADULT FILM THAT CHILDREN WILL BE CAPTIVATED BY<br /><br />I overcame my usual reluctance to see something new and bizare when I watched this DVD single disk edition over the past weekend with my 7 year old son. The result was simple: he loved it and demanded [reminiscent of some of the kids with gold tickets] that I replay many of the wild chocolate factory scenes -- over and over and I didn't mind doing it for him! The only other films that struck him in this way from first viewing were; "The Yellow Submarine", "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "Aladdin" and "The Wizard of Oz"! That puts Tim Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' in pretty good company I'd say.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Wedding Crashers"></head><body><p>The movie is pretty funny,though has some unnecessary nudity and offensive language/jokes. The last part where Owen Olsen is desperate is unnecessary and boring. Though it wouldn't happen in a real life, most likely, it's still funny to watch. Though it should have a warning "Don't try that at home."</p></body></html>

You will laugh out loud as you follow four animals who escaped from their comfortable digs at the New York Central Zoo. Led by their friends, aided by a wacky group of penguins, they set forth to return to their roots in Africa. After their ship wrecks, the animals find themselves on Madagascar and are befriended by a fun-filled group of lemurs. The movie has laughs, incredible animation, and is a nice story of friendship.</p></body></html>

Don't fall for that bit of misdirection in which the film is promoted as a Brad Pitt starrer. Brad Pitt isn't the lead as much as a key cog in a rather remarkable ensemble cast. Yes, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is partly about a gritty commando unit called the "Basterds," comprised of Jewish-American soldiers and led by Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine. On the surface, one questions whether the square-jawed American government would actually deploy such a mean and nasty terror team behind enemy lines to inflict brutal just desserts on them swastika-bearers, but we're all worldly folks here. Pitt plays his character as an unabashed caricature, and, in a weird way, he provides the brunt of the film's comedy. I say "in a weird way" because Lt. Aldo Raine happens to be a no-nonsense Southern-drawled gent who never backs down from his unsavory mission, nor does he shy away from inflicting torture on the Nazis. But he's got a way about him. There's an irrepressible glint in his eye when he remarks: "We're in the Nazi killing business ... and let me tell you cousin, business is a-booming." Brad Pitt is having fun spreading inhumane terror.<br /><br />But it's not all about the Basterds and their ruination of the German soldiers' beauty sleep. The Basterds get more screen time than the Howling Commandos in CAPTAIN AMERICA, but it's not by much. Tarantino has always had this knack of picking out actors who end up being perfect for their roles. And sometimes it means going out and finding a French actress to play a French character or a German actor (or, in this case, Austrian) to play the Nazi big bad. Christoph Waltz could not better be as Colonel Hans Landa, the slimy but fiendishly clever "Jew Hunter." Waltz turns in one of the year's most memorable performances, and it's even more impressive once you realize that he does this while speaking in three - almost four - languages. There's a sustained element of danger about him. Waltz imbues Landa with such serpentine intellect. The Colonel seems even more deadly when he's engaging in small talk with the other characters. You're rendered all nervous, wondering just what he's figured out and when he'll spring his trap on them unsuspecting targets.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place in Nazi-occupied France. The film is segmented into chapters, several of which feature the hard-bitten young Jewess Shoshanna Dreyfus who three years ago was Emanuelle Mimuex, a fugitive who witnessed the slaughter of her family. Nowadays Shoshanna is minding her business which happens to be running her own movie theater. But when her cinema becomes the site of a propaganda German film - an event to which the most highly ranked German officers are invited (even a certain failed artist) - Shoshanna sees a chance for get-back. I'd never seen French actress M&eacute;lanie Laurent in anything before, so I don't know if she's this routinely captivating. But her arc is the most heartbreaking. One of my favorite bits in the movie features Laurent in a showstopping sequence serenaded by David Bowie's "Cat People (Putting out Fire)." Others may say the inclusion of a Bowie song is jarring. I say it's friggin' brilliant.<br /><br />All the plot threads converge at Shoshanna's modest little theater, but not before Tarantino gets to play a little bit. He peppers his picture with compelling vignettes, treats us to colorful side characters. Michael Fassbender is very good as a British officer who goes undercover in France. Fassbender exhibits a cool steeliness which may have in part won him the part of Magneto in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. Diane Kruger gets maybe her meatiest role as German actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark. Til Schweiger and Eli Roth make their mark as, respectively, the Basterds' sadistic German recruit, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, and the baseball bat wielding Sgt. Donny Donowitz a.k.a. "the Bear Jew." For trivia buffs, Eli Roth directed HOSTEL and also the film within this film, NATION`S PRIDE, the German film which has its special screening at Shoshanna's theater. You can see this short film in its entirety in the DVD's bonus features.<br /><br />Tarantino's trademark cinematic flourishes are still present, although they may be a trifle subdued. His flair for dialogue isn't as in your face, mostly because sub-titles grace huge chunks of the film. But there's still a sense of suspense and the unexpected in the conversations. Anytime that Christoph Waltz chats up a potential suspect, or that tension-fraught sequence in the bar downstairs, the dialogue plays out like a high stakes chess match. I will say that I think this is the most disciplined that I've seen Tarantino in a while. Or maybe DEATH PROOF and its talky excesses lingers that strongly in the brain. That's not to say that INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS isn't talky, because it is. But Tarantino stays on point with the words. The script stays relevant to the plot. And while the action isn't at all as constant as that in KILL BILL, the violence when it arrives is chilling stuff. Lt. Aldo Raine's mandate is one hundred Nazi scalps from each of his men. They gleefully set about filling their quota. And if you're looking for a virtuous protagonist to pin your allegiance to, well, keep looking, brother. Tarantino delivers a strange, pulpy, morally-askewed war drama. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS may come off like an arthouse film, but it's not for sissies.</p></body></html>

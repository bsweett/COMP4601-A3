<meta name="summary" content="A thirty million dollar killing machine with a bad memory"></head><body><p>This film seemed to vanish quickly, so easily confused with about a dozen lesser films about spies and rampant covert operations. That's a shame, because this one is a cut above the rest that may have to wait a few years to get its due. <p>If you like spy films, or just well made action films that don't fizz at the end, you really should add this one to your collection. It's from the Robert Ludlum book, all about a highly and expensively trained covert agent suffering from amnesia. What this film has going for it is the following: <p>Director, Doug Liman, demonstrates an expert hand at action sequences. When master killing machine, Jason Bourne, senses something isn't right, Liman's expert film making begins to ratchet up the tension almost subconsciously. By the time the action comes, the viewer has been expertly brought to the edge of his seat. These action sequences build to a perfect climax of violence that is always satisfying. The fight scenes are among the finest I have seen in any recent film. There is nothing in this director's resume to suggest this, but trust me; he knows what he's doing. All the action has real weight and danger, which is an almost specialized talent for directors. Think Walter Hill. Thing Sam Peckinpah. <p>This movie also has brilliant, believable performances all around. <p>First and foremost among them, Matt Damon simply does everything right in this role. In an action film, often the lead isn't called upon to do a lot of top drawer acting, which is fine. Being believable in an action scene is talent enough, in my book. But in this role, Matt Damon is required to do some old-school, plain old acting, and he more than meets the challenge. See, the hook of this film is the main character, Jason Bourne, is waking up from an amnesia fog and slowly discovers his immense, instinctive prowess as a killer/agent. So the actor must make a shift now and then from moments of confusion and innocence to complete mastery of any physical situation. In addition, the character is slowly coming to the conclusion that the memories he has of his passed life, he no longer wants. In short, he does not want the life he is remembering. Damon is very touching in these scenes, and his acting is very, very solid. His performance here, and in The Talented Mr. Ripley, is so good it makes you wonder why he hangs around Ben Afleck. <p>Franka Potente, the actress who plays his romantic interest, is such an incredible actress. She is simply a pleasure to watch, and she always brings such authenticity to her roles. She is no model turned actress, this one. She demonstrated her action/acting chops in Run, Lola, Run, a few years ago, and it was a brilliant move casting her here. She is simply beautiful in a very unique way, and she can act the socks of the current crop of female leads. Potente always looks in place in al her roles, and it's a damn shame she doesn't get more work. <p>Finally, the smaller parts shine as well. My favorite being the assassin sent to kill Bourne, played with black-eyed menace by Clive Owen. It's a very small part, but crucial, and Owen makes the most of it. Also, the always reliable Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are on board as the sinister, competent bosses of the covert operations. <p>This is really a great addition to any action DVD collection. -Mykal Banta</p></body></html>

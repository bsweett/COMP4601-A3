Some were banal, some were exciting, and some were cursed.  Wrath of Khan is seen as one of the more exciting space adventures of Kirk and crew.<br /><br />As in the first film, "The Motion Picture", the script is based on an earlier episode of the original Trek, except "Wrath" could be called a sequel of sorts.<br /><br />The new USS Enterprise is going through its shake-down and Kirk, looking like he is destined for a desk job, takes a visit to "his" Enterprise.  Meantime, the Reliant is doing some exploring in the same area of space where Khan was exiled by Kirk many years ago (back in the Sixties don'tcha know).  Khan, expertly played in a reprisal role by Ricardo Montalban (Fantasy Island, etc)., still wants his revenge.  When the Reliant beam down a shore party, Khan recognizes Chekov and proceeds to take over the Reliant as a tool to find and kill Kirk.<br /><br />It's an interesting scene where Chekov is recognized by Khan, when Chekov was not in the earlier Sixties episode.  Oops.<br /><br />Not only do we have the cat & mouse game between Kirk and Khan, but another part of the plot gets into Kirk's lost love, a love child of sorts and a secret weapon that Khan wishes to unleash upon the universe.  This is important, as it then spawns three more Trek films!<br /><br />Kirstie Alley (Cheers) is competently playing a Vulcan in this one, and is somewhat coy, but I was hoping for some kinda love mix-up with Kirk.  Oh well, can't have everything.  This film was her film debut.  A lot slimmer here, too.<br /><br />Nicholas Meyer directed this exciting piece of Star Trek canon.  Highly recommended especially if you like intrigue and space battles!</p></body></html>

Like the Terminator getting a horrible third outing or Alien which had a really lackluster fourth one, the idea that another Rocky was coming out was almost like saying another franchise was getting another unceremonious finale. Imagine people's surprise when it actually didn't suck and it was - gasp - pretty good. It's not an awesome movie though but when you think about what it is and what it could've been, it's quite an achievement.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is having a hard time dealing with the highs of his youth and constant reminders of his current lows. Make matters worse, he has a rather shaky relationship with his son Robert and his wife Adrian has passed away. He's incredibly nostalgic for the old days and he has to realize the old days are over and he's seen as part of it. In the boxing world, current heavyweight champion Mason Dixon is underappreciated and booed since he keeps beating anyone he comes across and there's no heart in his fights. When a "what if" computer simulated fight appears on TV, it gets people curious and Rocky and Dixon seem up for it.<br /><br />But Rocky's old age and a "has-been" aura brought on by critics tries to deter him and while billed as an exhibition match for charity, it becomes an even bigger match for Rocky and for Dixon who wants to be appreciated by actually proving he's a good fighter since so many of his fights were rather easy. With the help of his son, Adrian's brother Paulie and Marie, now all grown up, Rocky steps into the ring and proves he can still pull off the impossible.<br /><br />If there's anything that's bad about the film is that there's a little bit too self-conscious tone to the film where it knows it's an underdog story and meant to be inspirational but it kinds of pushes it. Nearly every line of dialogue Rocky says is some beat-all-obstacles tagline that they'd put on movie posters (the one they probably didn't use for the movie ends up being the cover tagline I bet). And the whole thing just feels like a big downer after all since there's so much hardship Rocky has to deal with, you're almost surprised there wasn't a scene of him jumping off a bridge. Obviously this is meant to reinforce the more inspirational aspect of the film but it feels like the film's a walking Chinese cookie dispenser.<br /><br />Sylvestor Stallone I always saw as being lumped into that "action hero" stigma of guys who look tough and can say one liners but they can't act. In this, he's actually pretty good (though not Oscar-worthy) and if it wasn't for the aforementioned lines he says, it'd be a quite poignant performance. Milo Ventimiglia does an admirable job as his son Robert and Geraldine Hughes is also quite good as Marie who isn't really portrayed as a kind of "Adrian Part 2" but instead just a female friend Rocky can count on for support.<br /><br />The film as a whole is kind of erratic for the most part. The pacing during its initial two-thirds is sketchy with many scenes of Rocky reminiscing and trying not to let things get to him (such as a humorous scene where a young punk girl goes after him cause he didn't buy them beer). It takes a good hour before the fight is actually officially announced and then we go into the training montage, complete with the infamous music and the museum step run although amusingly, it has a dog in it. But the big star is the fight which is a big knockdown drag-out fight between Rocky and Dixon and, shot in HBO-like format rather than the "in the ring" approach Raging Bull had, it's still quite a rousing scene.<br /><br />I got a huge truth to spill: I never saw the original. I've seen snippets of scenes and I have seen IV but let's face it: I was 10 and I forgot most of it. So I can't really comment if this is the best Rocky since the original or a pale comparison. What it is though is a pretty good film and not the embarassment people thought it'd be, including me. Now, let's see if the Rambo sequel is the same thing.</p></body></html>

Many thought that the film would start a string of films where you wouldn't even have actors acting, just providing voices. Fortunately(or unfortunately), the film had stunning visuals but real bad story and just about everything else. So we have the digital stage, where everything besides certain props and the actors are filmed and everything else is computer. It looks great but we're a little way off from making the best use of this technology.<br /><br />Scientists keep disappearing and a man named Totenkopf is behind it. Reporter Polly Perkins(what a name huh?) finds out that scientists involved in some experiences were being taken and she finds out just in time before the Iron Giant-sized robots attack New York. So enter Sky Captain, saves Polly and takes down a robot.<br /><br />And with the help of Dex, Sky Captain's whiz-kid sidekick and one of his old flames, Franky, him and Polly try to figure out why Totenkopf is doing this and why it spells a certain end for Earth. All this gets them going all over the world flying over oceans and even swimming under them and going to Nepal to save the world.<br /><br />Like Sin City, all of the sets and backgrounds were CG while only the actors and certain interactive things were used. But the use of CG doesn't make photorealistic images that are indistinguishable from reality. They look real but you can instantly tell it isn't a real set. The film kind of has this stylized blurry look, even the actors almost have a golden shade on them.<br /><br />Along with Sky Captain, movies that have digital backlots are Sin City, Casshern(a japanese movie) and Immortel(italian) so we're still really recent with the technology but there's obviously bound to be more that'll show up.<br /><br />As a film it works mainly for its spectacle but when you start analysing everything such as plot holes, it sinks but if you don't bother thinking of it, you'll find you'll probably enjoy it. Maybe.</p></body></html>

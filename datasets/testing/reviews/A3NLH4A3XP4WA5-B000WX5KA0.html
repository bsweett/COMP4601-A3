Travis Bickle, the ex-marine loner has come to New York City in search of work.  Taking a job as a taxi driver, Travis slowly begins to realize the futility of his life, and the lonelyness that begins to plague him.  His days are filled with regularity, and he begins to inspire a hate towards the city, which he regards to be filled with disgusting garbage (He's right for the most part)that needs to be washed away.  Every day he becomes more enraged at his surroundings until he eventually becomes a self-appointed vigilante.  Attempting to rescue a teenage prostitute (Young star Jodie Foster) from the ghettos of the city, it becomes his mission.  A great film, one of Scorsese's best.</p></body></html>

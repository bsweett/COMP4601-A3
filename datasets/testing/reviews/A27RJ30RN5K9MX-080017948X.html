<meta name="summary" content="One of the funniest movies ever made"></head><body><p>Phil Conors ( Bill Murray) is a TV weatherman that is rude, conceited, and full of himself. Every year he gets stuck having to go to Punxsutawney, Pensylvania to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. Going with him this year is his sexy and cheerful producer Rita ( Andie McDowell), and his smart-mouthed, yet somewhat nerdy camera man Larry ( Chris Elliot). Phil wants to get out of town as soon as possible, but is snowed in when an unexpected blizzard hits. But things are about to get even worse. Phil wakes up the next morning to discover that it's Groundhog Day all over again. He is forced to live the same day over and over. But the more Phil is forced to repeat it, the more he comes to care about the town and those around him. But life really starts to get complicated when he finds himself falling for Rita. <p>"Groundhog Day" is one of the funniest and most original films ever made. Bill Murray has made a lot of outstanding films. But in my opinion, "Groundhog Day" is his best one. The repeating day is amazingly done. All of the actors do an extremely good job making each day look the same. The laughs that this film brings are non-stop. I even found myself rewinding scenes for a second and third viewing at times. Bill Murray is amazing as Phil Connors. Watching him play both roles is great. The first being the one who hates everybody and only cares about himself. Watching him try to kill himself over and over will make you laugh extremely hard. The other is the one that adjusts to live in Punksatawney and learns to care about those around him. No matter what he does, he will make you laugh. Andie McDowell is great as Rita. Her sweet and caring nature works well against Murray's negative attitude. The chemistry between her and Murray is amazing. One of the best romance stories I have ever seen. However, my favorite character was Stephen Tobolowsky's Ned Rierson. Every different time Ned and Phil meet, provides for the funniest scenes in the film. "Ned, I'd love to stay here and talk with you. But I'm not going to." Chris Elliot and the rest of the town are also all outstanding. <p>No matter how many times you see this film, you will never find it boring, repetitive, or less funny. In fact, you laugh harder with each viewing. The story, romance between Phil and Rita, and the great all around acting make Groundhog Day one of the best comedies ever made. The DVD is great, and the documentary : "The Weight of Time", is worth the price alone</p></body></html>

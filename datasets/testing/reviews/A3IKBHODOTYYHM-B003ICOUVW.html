Sorry.<br /><br />Dialogue spoken in the film, but words which might offer explanation of the newest monster installment, The Wolfman. Killing (if you pardon the pun) many of the classics with remakes has become all too common recently, unfortunately. However, films are big business, and essentially money driven to a degree, and masses eat up the blockbuster type of film, even if it strips down the story, diminishes the characters, or leaves you with no real connection to anything in the viewing experience other than "being entertained." I don't want to get "all nostalgic" on you, because there have been clever masterpieces that past films couldn't duplicate. We just often look to the originals as masterpieces not because they were flawless, but because they have spirit, mood and emotional connection, something that one might have witnessed seeing Chaney in the original version of The Wolfman. In this version, the main problems were the overuse of unnecessary gore (just for the sake of it), the lack of cleverness, and the formulaic characterization. The Wolfman is a film that just shoves too much in your face-- and you see it coming a mile away-- which kills the fun of the intensity or creepiness in seeing a monster or villain film.<br /><br />And yet, it's not all bad, really. What the remake is able to do is inject plenty of werewolf lore and legend in it, which does add to the atmosphere, although I wished the gypsies had more of a prominent role. Had they focused more on making us care about Lawrence Talbot rather than adding a hokey subplot of father and son (reminiscent of Teen Wolf) and superficial love story (why exactly do these two love each other?), I might have cared more about the film and been more involved. Instead, the viewing experience wasn't horrible, but just one that is easily forgotten, kind of like a fast food meal. Intermixed with appropriate Victorian background and dreary mood, we have lackluster main characters who trigger zero empathy. Consider Lon Chaney's Lawrence Talbot in The Wolfman's original: he had a genuine disturbing link to the horrible things that were happening to him, and his humanness necessitates pity on our parts. After all, we felt bad for him, and rooted for him even though we knew what had to happen. Here, Del Toro just seems to be sleepwalking. Sure, he does crank up the intensity somewhat towards the later stages of the film, when the action is high, but there's no build up to this point. Additionally. Talbot's father was a bit of an odd one. Maybe I'm the only one who thought that Anthony Hopkins' character turns into Hannibal Lector about the half way point of the film, with his calm, quiet instability bordering on homicidal maniac.<br /><br />While this film strives hard to give us the atmosphere and background to the idea of the werewolf, it ultimately resorts to mainstreaming itself so we can get up, grab a soda and popcorn, and forget about the film soon after.</p></body></html>

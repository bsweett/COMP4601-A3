Rachel McAdams (Lisa Reisert) and Cillian Murphy (Jackson Rippner) are great in their roles. The screenplay by Carl Ellsworth and the story by Ellsworth and Dan Foos is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also composed the score to the Scream movies and Cursed) is excellent. The cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is great. The film editing by Stuart Levy & Patrick Lussier (who has also edited the last 7 movies of Craven's) is great. The casting by Lisa Beach (who also did the casting for the Scream movies and Cursed) & Sarah Katzman (who also did the casting for Craven's Cursed) is great. The production design by Bruce Alan Miller (who also did the production design for Scream & Scream 3, and also did the production design for Music Of The Heart and Cursed) is excellent. The art direction by Andrew Max Cahn (who also did the art direction for Cursed) is excellent. The set decoration by Maggie Martin is excellent. The costume design by Mary Claire Hannan is excellent. This is a suspense thriller that is well-executed and gives Craven an excellent chance to do more suspense thrillers. I, somewhat, was not surprised by Craven's transition into suspense thrillers, because of his ability to make people think and his ability to scare people.</p></body></html>

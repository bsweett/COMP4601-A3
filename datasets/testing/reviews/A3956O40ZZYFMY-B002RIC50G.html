<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the Eastern European flavor of Hannibals youth tale. Hannibal Rising is easily better than at least one Anthony Hopkins presence in sequel, perhaps two.<br />The actor portraying the youthful medical student Lecter excelled in his role. Have failed to see him in anything else and don't really understand why.<br />Glad I purchased the streaming version though I had the DVD....made it easier to remain captain of my couch and my status as a video potato.....keeps my mind off the Presidents murder of our country.<br />I highly recommed this movie to anyone considering purchasing it in any form. Good entertaining movie with some chills. The Europeans cannot do much well consistently but on occasion they certainly excell. This is one instance illustrative of the latter.<br />Enjoy the movie somehow and let Amazon make it easy!!</p></body></html>

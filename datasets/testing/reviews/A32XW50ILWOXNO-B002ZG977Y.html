<meta name="summary" content="Good for Gemma...and not much else."></head><body><p>There's a whole slew of computer-generated creatures in this remake, but the most stunning visual is Gemma Arterton, a one-time Bond Girl whose eyes glint and puddle up as Io, the muse and demigoddess guide to Perseus (Sam Worthington) in this well-worn tale of Greek mythology. No surprises in this 90-minute quickie, aside from an awful turn as Hades from Ralph Fiennes, who appears to have swallowed a pill of Insta-Queeze, which is quite different from underworld menace.<br /><br />Perseus, son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), is a terribly grim sort, having lost his family in the war between men and gods. Reluctantly but without mercy, he slays a variety of beasts, chats up Io and eventually wins a showdown inside Medusa's lair with the help of a scorpion shield. Then it's on to the Kraken, which the audience never quite sees in full before it's turned to stone.<br /><br />Worthington appears headed for a lifetime of cop and soldier-of-fortune roles, while Arterton - with another upcoming starring role in Jerry Bruckheimer's beefcake epic "Prince of Persia" - is headed for the A-list. A British accent, toothy grin and hair that looks great thrown into ancient Scrunchies? I smell the second coming of Rachel Weisz.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="As Close An Encounter As I Want To Own"></head><body><p>There's been a raging argument since this film's release back in the late 70's: which is the better science fiction film, STAR WARS or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND?<p>I think those who've engaged that argument have been going about debate much the wrong way, for there are really no similarities in these two pictures except for the fact that both includes aliens and otherworldly craft ... but the comparison really stops there.<p>After its initial release, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS enjoyed a second release not much later with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: THE SPECIAL EDITION, which added footage cut and/or reshot to make the film a bit closer to visionary Steven Spielberg's dream picture.  The added footage, however, really was tacked onto the end of the film, giving viewers a glance inside the Mothership of the UFOs that have been haunting Earth.<p>CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND: THE SPECIAL EDITION is an amalgam of the two films, preserving the best essence of the two pictures by creating one complete whole.<p>Perhaps the greatest nod to this film is that there would be no THE X FILES without this film having been made.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS paved the way found countless variations on the theme of extraterrestrial contact.  In fact, Spielberg himself had initially dubbed E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL as the unofficial sequel to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, but he changed his mind last minute as the two films really have very little linkage.<p>This two-disc compilation boasts an excellent digitally mastered (audio and visual) product along with Dolby DTS and Dolby 5.1.  The second disc includes a Making of Documentary that gives some valuable history to the picture as well as commenting seriously on the films of Spielberg as a whole.  The deleted scenes add little to a film that already holds a complete rung on the ladder of the film industry.</p></body></html>

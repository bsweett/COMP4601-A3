<meta name="summary" content="It's the real deal...a psycho killer movie with TENSION!!"></head><body><p>This is what psycho killer thrillers should be like!  Actually INTENSITY, actual fear...actually making the viewer uncomfortable.<br /><br />Marie and Alexa, two college roommates, are off to visit Alexa's parents in their new country home.  Alexa is a bit boy-crazy, and Marie is obviously smitten with her friend.  They arrive at the quaint home late at night, briefly meet the parents and little brother, and then go to bed.  Suddenly, the peaceful, remote house is descended upon by a true madman, apparently bent on nothing more than kidnapping Alexa for what will clearly be prolonged abuse and brutal death.  The madman also dispatches the family...but misses Marie, who manages, in several breathtaking scenes, to avoid detection.  Her friend is whisked away, and Marie pursues.<br /><br />Yep, it sure does sound like Dean Koontz's INTENSITY...at least up until this point in the story, which is about halfway.  But it doesn't bother me, because the only American version of INTENSITY was a truly pitiful TV movie that had none of the grit and outright horror of the book.  So a couple of French guys stole his idea...let the courts work that one out.  Meanwhile, I got to enjoy that queasy feeling that only comes when a filmmaker steps over the line of commercial safe horror/thrills and into a pit of depravity.  The killings are horrific and graphic, but not in the way that makes audiences giggle outloud (a la NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET sequels or FRIDAY THE 13th, for example)...they are nasty, painful and almost enough to make you turn away or turn it off.  This is NOT a feel-good movie...it is bleak, bleak, bleak.  The low budget helps this aesthetic, and for American viewers, it probably helps that none of the performers are recognizable.  They look more like real people than we are accustomed to seeing in glossy US films.<br /><br />Many people have complained about the "surprise" ending.  My only real problem with it is that the filmmakers foreshadow it just a bit too much for my tastes.  I kinda saw it coming...granted, I forgot about that once the madman began his bloody work.  The twist isn't terribly original, not does it stand up to scrutiny, BUT the twist doesn't keep the gory thrills from coming, and presumably that's the only reason we started watching in the first place.<br /><br />The young actress who plays Marie is very good, in my opinion.  She cuts quite a figure with her short hair and sinewy limbs.  And the guy who plays the madman...well, I kept wondering if this guy would be able to keep his friends after they saw him in the movie...he's quite unpleasant, and believable.<br /><br />The film does have flaws.  The first death suffers with some poor special effects...but after that, they improve a great deal.  Also, the events unfold the way they do only because no one in the house is awakened by family members screaming bloody murder...literally.<br /><br />But it does create some HIGH TENSION, and has a heroine who doesn't make one stupid mistake after another...we can actually follow her logic from one move to the next.  Sometimes we know more than she does, but at no time do we shake our heads in wonder at her stupidity.  It's amazing how much of a difference that makes in enjoying a thriller.  I recommend the movie, if the kind of gore and thrills I've talked about interest you.  By the way, the DVD appears to default to playing the dubbed version.  Avoid this...I watched about 1 minute of it, and greatly disliked it.  The "American" voices were VERY poorly matched.  I would select the "original uncut French version" and then be sure to select "subtitles" as well...this takes two separate selections.</p></body></html>

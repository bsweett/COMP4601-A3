His relationship with his ailing father has long suffered from his father's love of absurd tall tales, which Will has interpreted to be a wall or form of distance between his father and him. He feels he has never known the real Ed Bloom. He agrees to come to his dying father's bedside in a bid to find out once and for all who his father was. Contentious relations aside, Will returns to hear the larger than life fish tales once more. The sadness of the story is bittersweet-otherworldly flashbacks brought to fantastical life by Tim Burton's unparalleled creative eye and the wide, bright, inviting smile of the ever engaging Ewan McGregor as a young Ed Bloom. Albert Finney's narration takes on new life when personified as such. Will's skepticism is eventually quelled as he realizes that these stories are who his father is, and when he finds out that there is some truth behind the hyperbole. He learns finally to love and respect his father, whatever his quirks. At once both whimsical and moving.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jason's Rampage Continues in Part 3"></head><body><p>Jason (Richard Brooker) continues to roll up the body count in this somewhat lame and very predictable sequel.  Jason has managed to survive having a machette thrust into his neck at the end of part 2, and now he has come upon a small general store and its two unsuspecting occupants.  Soon, they are added to Jason's body count.<br /><br />Meanwhile, another group of "innocent" and horny teenagers are on their way to the lake.  Chris (Dana Kimmel) has survived an earlier encounter with Jason.  She ran away from her house and ended up alone in the woods.  That was when Jason tried to attack her.  However, she blacked out and somehow ended up back in her own room.  She's come back to finally get rid of her fears.  Several of her friends have decided to come along.<br /><br />Their first mistake occurs when Chris and Shelley go into town to buy groceries.  They run into a rough motorcycle gang.  Unfortunately for Shelley, he backs into one of the motorcycles, which in turn knocks over the rest.  Enraged, the gang takes off after Chris and Shelley.  They follow Chris and Shelley back to camp where they decide to burn down the barn, but Jason get ahold of them before they can carry out their plan.<br /><br />After that, the teenagers start dropping off one by one until Chris is left to face Jason alone.  Will Chris survive, or will Jason add her to his ever-growing list of victims?<br /><br />I thought this movie was worse than the first tow.  This was billed to be even more scary, because it was filmed in 3-D.  The 3-D effects may have looked good in the theater, but they are non-existant on the DVD.  The plot of this series has become very predictable, and there is nothing really different from the first two movies of the series.  Jason does find his trademark hockey mask in this movie, however.<br /><br />I recommend this movie only if you are serious about watching every following one.  One aspect I do like is that there is a short recap of part 2 at the beginning of this movie.  This helps the viewer in case one forgot what happened previously.  Hopefully, the movies following this one will get a little better and everything won't be so predictable.</p></body></html>

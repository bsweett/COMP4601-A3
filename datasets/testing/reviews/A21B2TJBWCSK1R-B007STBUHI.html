<meta name="summary" content="Worth double-dipping only for the completist"></head><body><p>The dominance of the Hollywood summer blockbuster can be attributed (or blamed depending on how you feel about them) to two filmmakers: Steven Spielberg with Jaws and George Lucas with Star Wars. But Spielberg was there first with Jaws, an exciting adventure film about a great white shark terrorizing a small, seaside town that scared the crap out of millions of people the year it came out. The movie was a bonafide phenomenon, becoming the first one to ever surpass $100 million at the box office.<br /><br />Jaws holds up today because it is an adventure film that doesn't rely solely on exciting action sequences. Its foundation is a strong story and engaging characters with memorable dialogue (most notably the famous monologue that Quint delivers with chilling intensity). More importantly, we care about what happens to these characters and that is something a lot of Jaws imitators failed to copy successfully. Spielberg and co. essentially created a contemporary monster movie that works so well because it plays on a primary fear of being in the water and not having control of one's environment (i.e. drowning). As a result, Jaws has aged well over three decades while its numerous sequels and imitators have not.<br /><br />When Jaws was released on DVD to commemorate its 25th anniversary it was heavily criticized for including a truncated version Laurent Bouzereau's excellent feature-length Making Of documentary. For the 30th anniversary they've rectified this situation but unless you're a devotee it's not really worth the double-dip. Gone from the previous version is the trivia game, the Shark World documentary, the trailers and the screen saver so completists might want to hold on to their old discs.<br /><br />On the first DVD are 13 minutes worth of deleted scenes and outtakes. There is more footage of the crime scene of the first shark attack and a nice bit where Quint playfully mocks some poor kid for playing a clarinet in a music store.<br /><br />New to this edition is "From the Set," a profile on the movie done on location. A British film crew follows a young Spielberg around and interviews him, providing an interesting snapshot of the then up-and-coming filmmaker.<br /><br />The second DVD features the real reason to purchase this edition (aside from the excellent movie, of course), a two-hour retrospective documentary restored to its full glory. It covers all the usual bits: the mechanical shark that rarely worked, the mercurial presence of Robert Shaw, the source of Quint's famous monologue, and so on. This is a fascinating, in-depth look at how Jaws came together, the challenges that a young Spielberg faced and the eventual phenomenon that developed as the film thrilled audiences all over the world.<br /><br />Also included are galleries of storyboards by Tom Wright, production photos taken on location, and movie posters and ads from all over the world.<br /><br />Finally, there is an attractive 60-page photo journal with glossy stills and quotes from cast, crew and the movie.</p></body></html>

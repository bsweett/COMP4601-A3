<meta name="summary" content="another great oscar fave"></head><body><p>in 2005, i had to say my favorite movies were Brokeback Mountain, Crash, and this film Walk the Line. i was slightly dissapointed that it wasent nominated for best picture but at least Witherspoon got a well deserved oscar, otherwise i would be PO'd. the film, like last years Ray, tells the story of another music legend. this time, Johnny Cash. we see his upbringings from childhood, to the time he enrolled in the army, marrys his girlfriend, and then that day he walks into that studio and earns himself a spot on the label. then the film focueses on his love for June Carter and it then plays on out like a Johnny Cash song. i thought the performences were exceptional from Pheonix playing the rugged Cash and Witherspoon, wow has she grown. its hard to belive this is the same girl who played the 'dumb blond' Elle Woods in the legally blonde series. her performence definently deserved that oscar and i'm proud of her. so, see the movie thats on my top 10 list and you'll be blown away.</p></body></html>

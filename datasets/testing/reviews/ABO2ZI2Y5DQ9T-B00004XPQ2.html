And the film's setting may lead you to think this masterpiece as a &quot;war movie&quot;; that is not exactly true.<p>&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; begins with intense battle of will.  As British Colonel Nicholson (Guinness) refuses to join the work of building a bridge, Japanese Colonel Saito tests his will in the most extreme ways.  But many keen-eyed viewers will soon realize that both have something in common, which finally draws each other after Nicholson's long, long suffering under the hot sun in Southeast Asia.  Ironically, Nicholson finds himself deeply involved in nearly impossible task of building a bridge more than he actually knows.  But to what purpose?<p>As this storyline shows, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; brilliantly works as a fable, and the superb acting of Alec Guinness, whom younger generations probably remember as Obi-Wan of &quot;Star Wars,&quot; will rivet your eyes on the screen.  The cinematograhy is also great, capturing the humid climate of the place to give the film authentic atmosphere.  But most of all, this is made before CGI became popular in moviemaking -- just imagine they had to make all of those production designs!<p>Looking back from now, David Lean's epic-scale story seems to lose its power in the latter half of the film, in which Holden's character tries to destroy the bridge.  His character is a little unconvincing, compared with Guinness and Hayakawa, and Lean, I am afraid, stretched the film too long to depict Holden's deadly mission though his trek in the jungle itself is an engrossing one.  And you may feel Hayakawa'a performance is a little theatrical -- but keep in mind, he first became an instant star in Hollywood in 1915 with &quot;Cheat&quot; (directed by Cecil B. DeMille, another director who preferred big-scale movies).  But don't worry, you soon forget these things.<p>&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; is a masterpiece that only golden age of Hollywood could produce; not flashy special effects but talented actors with dedicated crew made it possible to exist.  Watch it.<p>Pierre Boulle, a French writer who wrote the original book of &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; based on his own experience during the WW2 and his days in prison camp, is also the author of &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;  The latter book (and the original film, to some extent) is also intelligent and iroical as well as David Lean's masterpiece.  Try it.</p></body></html>

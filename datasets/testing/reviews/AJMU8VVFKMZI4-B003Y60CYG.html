But I don't know what the heck this is.  Sure, I recognized all the characters.  Guy Noir and Lefty and Dusty and blah, blah.  But where is the plot?  Okay, there's a thin one about the show being cancelled and all, but couldn't Garrison made this a little more compelling?  People talking to angels like it's the most natural thing on earth.  People dying and no one acting like they really cared. Oh, yeah they will go sing veiled songs, but really, I was bored to death.  This movie was a huge disappointment for me.</p></body></html>

Although, I do agree with others that the casting of Hoffman and Streisand is out of this world.  They couldn't have been better, though whoever did Streisand's makeup should be taken out to the Everglades and shot like a croc.  But the same catasrtophe happens to youngish Teri Polo in this film.  In the first one, she looked pretty, in this one, she looks harsh and garish, older than Blythe Danner.  It's like they hate her.<br /><br />It must have been madness on the set as for decades people have been saying that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were the most demanding and difficult stars in Hollywood.  Has time mellowed them, or have they finally woken up and smelled the coffee, that their careers have pretty much ended as stars, sure Barbra can still sing, but for the rest, are either of them ever going to get as simpatico a hand-made part as the script of MEET THE FOCKERS gives them?  As Bernie and Roz Focker, they shine.  Everyone's good, but the movie itself just sits there, nothing happens and nobody really cares.  Ben Stiller gets himself in one embarrassing situation after another, but the actor has played this role so many times before we don't even feel for him any longer.<br /><br />I liked that the Fockers cherished their son so much, never made him feel inadequate, smothered him with kisses, framed his jock and his 9th place bowling ribbons and trophies.  In their eyes he's the best male nurse in the world.<br /><br />De Niro's CIA thing continues to be creepy.  For the next Focker picture I'd like Hay Roach to step down and somebody like Ken Loach or George Clooney take over the directors chair and show De Niro's character invading and decimating Ghana or Ecuador or somewhere.  Find the laughs there, Focker.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb, Mainly due to Ron"></head><body><p>Looking at the HELLBOY  comics, it is hard to see anyone else than Ron Perlman in this role, and thats exactly what the commentary says. As I read it, and hear it, Ron was first and last Choice. The guy is such a master actor, yet oddly enough he is probably type-cast ( in terms of profile, not simply because his is one hell of an actor).<br />The touch that really works here is detail. The Director is, seemingly, a master of making the most of what he has, and doing it in amazing ways. The use of mirrors in one subteranean sequence is a master work.<br />Together with the creator of HELLBOY, and a team of skilled actors, and staff, the director evinces a world from the comics in a superb. Finally, it does boil down to the actors, and all else augments  what they do, as it should, and the end  result is a great potboiler.<br />Enjoy !!!</p></body></html>

There is nothing extraordinary about THE HURT LOCKER, which is the least-viewed "Best Picture" in history, a kind of reminder that "Best Pictures" don't equate to "Most Popular Pictures."<br /><br />It's the story of a US Army bomb-defusing specialist in Iraq, and the various horrors he faces unflinchingly throughout the day. As such, its a grand endorsement of our troops and a grand indictment of our war.<br /><br />Still, I have no idea why THE HURT LOCKER won, other than it wasn't the bloated AVATAR. From what I've read it isn't particularly accurate, and it has a pace slower than that of its hero in his blast suit. It's worth seeing (once), but its not at all memorable. If it hadn't been the dark horse Oscar winner, I doubt I'd even remember it.</p></body></html>

Like all films in this genre, it has an impending disaster with catastrophic results waiting in the wings unless a motley crew of scientists, military folks and nerds can get something together to put an end to the destruction of the world.  It has sensationalized gizmos, unbelievable heroics, and wonders out the wazoo.  But let's be honest, that's why people watch movies like this.  They're fun, sometimes moving, and a great way to kill a couple of hours without having to worry about the real world.<br /><br />You could bunch this movie together with similar disaster flicks like "Deep Impact," "Armageddon," and "The Day After Tomorrow."  Heck, you can also throw in movies like "Independence Day."  On the other hand, "The Core" has something that these films don't, and that is good acting and a fairly decent script.  I actually felt for some of the characters in this flick.  Aaron Eckhart has one particularly moving scene with Hilary Swank's character after she is forced to make a decision that results in the death of a crew member.  In the typical scenes of this genre, where a character sacrifices themselves for the others and the good of mankind, the acting is so good that you forget how standard this type of scene is in a disaster film.  That's what sets "The Core" apart from the rest of the pack.  Throw in great comedy from D.J. Qualls as a hacker-supreme and the snooty air about Stanley Tucci's professor and you've got a fun film worth multiple views.<br /><br />With a brilliant cast, good special effects, and a solid script for this genre, I highly recommend "The Core" for some rainy-day, popcorn-type fun.</p></body></html>

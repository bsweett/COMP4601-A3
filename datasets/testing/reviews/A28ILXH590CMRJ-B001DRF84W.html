<meta name="summary" content="HULK has some action, but more angst from Ang Lee"></head><body><p>Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a man with secrets.  Dealing with extreme repressed memories as the result of a tragedy that resulted in the death of his mother and the arrest of his father, Banner has become so withdrawn that it causes his break-up with fellow scientist Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  During the course of researching cell-regeneration, Banner must save a fellow worker from a potentially lethal overdose of gamma radiation.  Now, whenever he's angry, Banner morphs in the raging green powerhouse known only as the Hulk.  <p>After the great success of X-MEN, DAREDEVIL and SPIDER-MAN, it was inevitable that Marvel's Jekyll &amp; Hyde character, the Hulk would get his shot at cinematic glory.  After all, in the 40 years since he first popped out of the comic pages, this rampaging monster had thrilled many a reader as well inspiring a classic TV series.  When director Ang Lee (CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) was tapped for the project, the expectations were very high indeed.  While the final result is definitely impressive, it is not completely successful.  <p>Part of this stems from the fact that Lee plays the story completely straight, with hardly any traces of the humor that marks previous Marvel adaptations.  While it makes sense with his overall vision, it makes the first 40 minutes of the film a bit of a drag.  Indeed things finally start to pick up when Banner finally makes his big change to the Hulk at that point.  As repressed Banner, Bana definitely nails the character.  However, the character's very nature makes it very hard to sympathize with him.  In contrast, Jennifer Connelly fares better as his concerned girlfriend.  Surprisingly, the most effective performance comes from Sam Elliott's portrayal as General "Thunderbolt" Ross.  While he comes across as a typical hard-nosed soldier, one can sense the conflicted depths of the man.  The CGI created Hulk is also effective in providing the emotion that Bana seemingly lacks.  Nick Nolte turns in a rather bizarre performance as Banner's long-lost father that strangely fits into Lee's directorial vision.<p>Like the other Marvel movies, the action scenes in this flick are top notch.  You only wish there were more of them and less angst in the picture.<p>Overall, HULK is definitely a noble effort by Ang Lee to produce a serious look at the super-hero genre. It might not please everyone, but it is a unique entry in the super-hero film field.  As a result, it is definitely worth your time and my recommendation.</p></body></html>

It is one of the most brilliant and breathtaking, if not one of most abstruse, films I ever seen. Amadeus is much more a complex film than it seems. The performances of Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham are engrossing. Oh the story...it's so fascinating and different. Imagine a different kind of a murder without actually committing it directly or indirectly. Call it a genius. Another kind of genius is shown in Wolfgang Mozart Amadeus, played royally by Tom Hulce, who sadly never came to rise out of this role in successive roles. Some might say Amadeus is boring. Some might say Amadeus is pointless. Some might say Amadeus was overlong. Some might say Amadeus was nothing much more than the music. To all those who said them, they missed out a masterpiece. Who was responsible for it? Saul Zaentz along with Milos Forman. I had never seen a story so brilliantly based on true accounts and written down like Amadeus. I found Amadeus an extraordinarily difficult film to ponder because in one way sensible, and in another way, no. A fascination and deep adoration by Antonio Salieri, played...how can I say...breathtakingly by F. Murray Abraham, yet he remains madly envious of something beyond him that was transposed into the wrong type of a person. Amadeus is a film that is beyond itself. I regard Amadeus a film of the decade.<br /><br />9/10: I am going to drop the rating of Amadeus from `10' to `9'. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent movie. But it gets boring at times, especially in the final thirty minutes. Perhaps Amadeus is a bit too long? The acting is great, especially by Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham, and Jeffrey Jones. They all are scene stealers when they can. I just wished the movie was a bit more interesting to watch and enough for me to open my eyes wider. All in all, Amadeus is a marvelous picture.</p></body></html>

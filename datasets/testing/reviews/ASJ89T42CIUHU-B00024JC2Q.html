<meta name="summary" content=""Old School" Laughter!"></head><body><p>For those of you who had a love affair with the original Starsky & Hutch detective series from the 70's you will find this movie quite entertaining.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is nearly perfect as the serious Starsky, he even takes on many of the mannerisms and scowls that the original character embodied. Stiller makes this film with his dry humor. Playing opposite Stiller is Owen Wilson who creates a new Hutch. Wilson is quirky and somehow sexy in a very funny way. These two actors make a brand new comedy team and you won't be disappointed in this film if you enjoy the way they tag team off one another for a laugh. Of course Snoop Dog does a great job as Huggy Bear too and the red and white Grand Terino takes on the original car with a few new tricks!<br /><br />This movie is a great laugh and an evening of nostalgia for people who grew up watching the original series. Many scenes are re-created almost to a perfect tee! The 70's clothing deserves a shout out as well! The only negative aspect I found was in the dimwitted women, like Carmen Electra, who dance across the screen every now and then without much meaning. Otherwise this movie is a comedy gem and worth watching more than once. Look for the cameos of the original Starsky and Hutch and try not to feel too old!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Makes The Godfather seem like a nursery story"></head><body><p>This 2007 British import is one of the bloodiest and violent films I have ever seen.  It's about the Russian mafia in London and there are scenes in this film that makes The Godfather seem like a nursery story.  Perhaps it's because there is less censorship nowadays but whatever it is, the film feels real, the plot fast and easy to follow and the acting superb.<br /><br />Set in London, Naomi Watts is cast as a nurse in a maternity war who has problems of her own.  She's English born but she lives with her mother and Uncle, both of whom are Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s.  When a teenage girl in her care gives birth and then dies, she has deep feelings for the baby.  She therefore sets out to uncover the mystery of the teenager who has left a diary in the Russian language, which she, herself, cannot read.  She asks her uncle to translate it and when he refuses she goes to an older Russian man who owns an upscale Russian restaurant and who seems to be grandfatherly to everyone around them.<br /><br />While this is going on, the audience sees some vile murders, and one grizzly scene where Viggo Mortenson, cast as a Russian chauffeur, has to dispose of a body.  He works for the older Russian man and his wild and crazy son played by Vincent Cassel.  Violence is everywhere.  Young girls are brought from Russia and forced into brothels.  There is greed, deception and horrific murders.<br /><br />Naomi Watts starts to uncover the truth, and Viggo Mortenson, who was nominated for an Academy Award for this role, starts to befriend her.  There is a stoic cold blooded calmness about him that is quite unnerving.  Then, he is central to one scene in a Russian bathhouse which is the most violent I have ever seen.<br /><br />How this all plays makes for really good drama.  I was at the edge of my seat the whole time.  Then, by the end of the film, all the loose ends are tied up in satisfactory way that makes sense.  Good filmmaking.<br /><br />Recommended, especially for those who are not afraid of nonstop action and violence.</p></body></html>

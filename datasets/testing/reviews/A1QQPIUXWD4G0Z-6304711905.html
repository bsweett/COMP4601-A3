<meta name="summary" content="Val Kilmer Is What Makes This Film Worth Watching"></head><body><p>George P. Cosmatos' rather overrated 1993 western covering the events and characters of the famous shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona, between the Earps and the Clantons.  Although brought to life by a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer and modest acting by everyone else, the film suffers from an uneven screenplay that tries to incorporate too much of a sstory in light of its narrow subject.<br /><br />As the title indicates, the entire film is primarily about what led to the shootout at the OK Corral instead of being about the life of Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel.)  Unfortunately, it seems that the film can't make up its mind as to whether it wants to deal more with its characters or its setting.  As such, we have a Wyatt Earp who should be worrying about the Clantons but is more cocerned with explaining issues that have little relevance to the main plot (e.g. a rather shallow love story that just takes time away from the film dealing with the Clantons or other important characters.)  Other nuances just add to the irritation; the most absurd part being a cattle-rustling and illiterate cowboy engaging in a Latin wit contest with Doc Holiday (please, the Clantons were low-life cattle russtlers who could barely even read English.)  The story tends to stumble upon itself in this fashion leading to a rather hurried ending that is anti-climactic.<br /><br />In sum, it's a rather overrated film that became popular mainly, if not exclusively, because of Val Kilmer's excellent performance as Doc Holliday.  Apart from that, the screenplay is uneven in its treatment of the characters and in terms of plot continuity. A good film to own or rent but it certainly isn't one of the best westerns to have been made.  For a better study of Wyatt Earp as a character and his life, watch 'Wyatt Earp' with Kevin Costner instead.</p></body></html>

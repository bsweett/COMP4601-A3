<meta name="summary" content="I'm talking to an empty telephone. `Cause there is a dead man on the other end of this line!,"></head><body><p>A professional and life long criminal, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is planning an armored car robbery and he has formed a crew to work with him in the planning and execution of the plan. Neil steals an ambulance to use as a cover for the robbery. One of his right hand men is Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) who is assigned the task of buying the explosives for the job. One hotshot on the team kills a guard and as a result the men kill all of the guards.<br /><br />The Los Angeles Police Department is in charge of the investigation of the robbery and Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) heads the investigation. The robbers took bearer bonds worth over 1.6 million dollars. Hanna realizes the the men were top notch professionals who had a plan, a schedule, and knew how to use high-tech shaped bombs.....<br /><br />This is a movie that is extremely well written and an intellectual film. This is what happens when a smart cop meets a smart career criminal and they face off across the opposite sides of the law. Both men have a lot in common with disrupted and chaotic personal lives.<br /><br />The cast in this movie is simply outstanding and they play their roles to perfection. Not only are the male actors in the movie are the best, so are the women with Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman and Ashley Judd playing key roles. If you love suspenseful and well done movies with a great plot then this film is the one you want to see. I loved this movie and I recommend it to you.</p></body></html>

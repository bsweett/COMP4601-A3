"Die Another Day" pulls out all the stops with a globe-trotting, action-packed story and a solid cast.<br /><br />When a secret mission into North Korea is betrayed, Bond is captured and tortured.  When exchanged for another spy, Bond is put on ice on suspicion of being the traitor who compromised the mission.  Bond promptly strikes out on his own to prove his innocence.  An unofficial visit to Cuba gets Bond reinstated, and introduces him to Jinx (an excellent Haile Berry), an American agent on the same trail.  That trail takes Bond to London, Iceland, and eventually back to North Korea in search of a clever villain with two faces, and a traitor inside MI-6.  The concluding sequence in North Korea is an over-the-top hailstorm of fisticuffs, sword fights, and special effects, as Bond tries to head off another Korean war.<br /><br />There is a lot to like in "Die Another Day."  All the familiar elements of a James Bond thriller are here.  John Cleese as "Q" serves up an arsenal of high tech tools.  MI-6 headquarters gets some real (and humorous virtual) screen time as Bond trades quips with his boss (a returning Judi Dench as M) and her secretary Miss Moneypenny.  The menacing villain of the story has the usual twisted backstory.<br /><br />There is also a sense the movie is trying too hard; too many exotic action sequences blur the plot, while the pile of self-referrential 007 jokes becomes distracting.  Brosnan really was starting to look too old for the role.  Nevertheless, "Die Another Day" is recommended to fans of the James Bond franchise.</p></body></html>

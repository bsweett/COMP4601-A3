<meta name="summary" content="Kudos To Everyone Here, Not Just Whitaker"></head><body><p>I agree Forest Whitaker was very good as the famous mentally-disturbed leader of Uganda, Idi Amin, back in the 1970s but, despite the Oscar he received as "Best Actor," I thought the best thing about this film was the involving story. Once the co-star of the film, James McAvoy as "Dr.Nicholas Garrigan," became Amin's personal doctor this film, like a good book, became really difficult to put down.<br /><br />It was a very interesting story which got better and better as it went along. It's also one you won't forget about in a few days. This one stays with you!<br /><br />In real life, Amin was a brutal man and much more so than he is portrayed in this film. It's a disgrace he was able to live comfortably in exile until 2003. Whitaker's portrayal of the sociopath doesn't touch the surface of the Amin's evilness, but Amin, truth be told, was also a charmer. It's amazing how a little charm can make even a mass murderer look like a nice guy.<br /><br />In addition to the fine acting performances of Whitaker and McAvoy, I thought the camera-work in here was well above-average, too. This is a nicely-filmed movie, and credit should go to cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. I don't hear much praise going his way but I really liked the visuals in here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Finally! A horror film that delivers!"></head><body><p>This movie is a top! After seeing it in May of 1999, I was truly happy with my decision to spend my money and time on it. Full of breathtaking effects, hilarious levity and terrific performances, this movie is a  must-see for anyone who is a fan of Brendan Fraser or anyone who likes  movies that don't totally scare. This movie, along with Jan de Bont's The  Haunting, doesn't scare people out of their wits and isn't full of blood  and guts like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer. The DVD release is  a winner, but not by all costs. It would be appreciated if it had a Dolby  Surround 2.0 soundtrack, but the special features deliver. In the mood for  a scare, without the bodily fluids? Try this one out.</p></body></html>

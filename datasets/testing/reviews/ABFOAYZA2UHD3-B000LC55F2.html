<meta name="summary" content="one of the best movies i have ever seen"></head><body><p>but, if you expect me to retell the plot, you have come to the wrong place. i never do it, it spoils the experience.<br />but i can tell you the story of this movie is brilliant, intriguing, full of twists, and it keeps your eyes locked on the screen thruout the movie.<br />brilliant acting by jackman and bale, but also by bowie as tesla.<br />costumes, jewellery, all so authentic, paired with great acting makes it almost real.<br />the story, as always, is universal story of humanity - of love, passion, sacrifice, choices, obsession, deceit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Not Bad For A Michael Bay Film"></head><body><p>After watching most of Bay's films with a feeling that I had lost many brain cells after they were over, The Island is a step in the right direction. This film is more of a Sci-Fi/Drama than it is an all out action assault that Michael Bay is known for. The acting is good from Ewan McGregor and Steve Buscemi, while Scarlett Johansson just looks beyond lovely as she always does. The chase scene towards the middle of the film is the highlight by far. I am just glad that Bay made a film that actually provides some food for the brain rather than just a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Visitation Rights (or Rites, as it were): you get the real Alice on the weekends, we get her when we need a hero"></head><body><p>After taking a Wonderland Hiatus, Alice finds herself gorwn up and in the thralls of a marriage she really doesn't want. As she is deciding what to do - or how to escape - a little rabbit with a nice pocketwatch appears in the brush and starts his run. alice follows him, finds a hole leading dooown, and ends up in a place that she knows - sort of.<br /><br />When I watched this movie, I had mixed feelings on the outcome. First of all, they introduced the Jabberwakee (sorry about the spelling) and I really didn't like what I saw. I had always pictured it as something worse than it was - something that was Wonderlandish and really out-of-place when it came to description.<br /><br />Next, there was the state of the world we see. We have a caterpillar that is small and that doesn't have the sdame impact that he did once upon a time. Since he was a favorite of mine, that really messed with something I enjoyed quite a bit.<br /><br />Another thing is the whole thing with the White and Red Queen. All of my comments are meant not to be spoilers (that's why I don't explain what the Jabber is) but I can say a few things like I really didn't like the way that the Cards play out against Chess Pieces, that the Queens are both decorative but not the things I liked, and that certain things are not the way they would be best suited. Sometimes, certain things seem to take the path of least resistance. The C. Cat, for example, if nice but not exactly as fun as he could be. It was as if he was being anchored in a bay of trival ideas and not being given free reign.<br /><br />The good is good, however, and I have to give a lot of stuff props. I like the visuals, do like the movement of some of the pieces, and I really liked how the Hatter is explored. This is a social and political commentary on a world that is having a civil war - it isn't seen through a little girl's eyes and perhaps she sees more. This is played out well and, much like older times, it updates some ideas. Still, I really thought that a doormouse, the selection of eyes, and a few beasts being friendly seemed like they came from other movie ideas.<br />It bites and scratches but loves you in the end - have you seen that before?<br /><br />I know a lot more pros could have been listed nad, seeing the movie again, I can say that I would like it more. Thhe first glance is one of expectation and, well, it did not live up to what I thought of. Tim Burton's style is partially to credit and to bblame, working as a sword that cuts on both sides. If you love it you will love the movie - hate it and the movie will hurt your love for Wonderland.<br /><br />Should you see it? If you noted the first taste of the thing then I would say yes. I liked the first myself and I saw it because of this BUT I must say that I didn't like some of the introduction and some of the same tricks. - Eat me, Drink Me - That was something I knew. Heads in a moat - nice upgrade. So, I give it a 4 because of some of the stuff but I think it is a 4 that comes from a place that was birthed way back when.<br />See it but look over what you are seeing first (and, pllllease, avoid any spoilers that you can that will give away the big stuff that progresses)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautifully boring"></head><body><p>Every scene, if not every frame of Marie Antoinette is beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. The sets, the costumes, the FOOD. Everything. It's a demonstration of what big movies should strive to provide. Everywhere you turn there's more amazing costumes, hair, and backdrops for the story to play out on.<br /><br />The problem is that there's hardly any story to play out. Amidst all the decadent, eye-popping design the story falls entirely flat. Actually falling would imply that it was moving and then stumbled. This story decides never to stand up. Over half of the movie is dedicated to the "oh-so-depressing" storyline that poor Marie can't consumate her marriage with her husband. Over and over we see Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman in bed, unable to... to what? If we're supposed to be shown how bored Dunst's Antoinette is, believe me, we've got it.<br /><br />The idea of the movie seems to involve exploring the self-indulgent lifestyle of the queen of France, while also painting her as a real human who's had such a "tough" life because her husband won't sleep with her and she had to leave her homeland of Vienna. In examining this queen, however, the entire film comes off as hopelessly self-indulgent.<br /><br />Marie Antoinette feels like a posh joke played on an unsuspecting audience. Although, just from the cover, you've got to be suspecting something. The cast features a mixture of British and American actors. So, some of the "french" characters and some of the "austrian" characters have American accents and some have British accents. Molly Shannon is thrown in for good measure, along with Rip Torn as the King of France. If that doesn't tip audiences off that something is wrong, what will? Jason Schwartzman, who's usually a delight to watch, is entirely miscast, unless miscasting is the idea of ALL the casting, in which case Sofia Copolla cast her film perfectly... making sure that nothing would actually make sense, and no one would actually look like they belonged.<br /><br />Overall, this film is a waste of $40 million, unless you want to hang your television on the wall, put this movie in, mute it, put on some good music, and host a party. Then I could see how the eye candy might be worthwhile. But as far as a story-line or anything that is comprehensible or enjoyable, look somewhere else.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are mostly typical: trailers, trailer for Marie Antoinette, and a pretentious "making of" featurette, where we get to hear about how amazing Sofia Copolla's adaptation is (including Francis Ford Copolla, PRODUCER, saying that the more personalized Sofia made it, the better it would be). The one cool bonus on the DVD is the short "Cribs with Louis XVI", where Jason Schwartzman is walking through the palace in semi-character describing his crib to MTV. Slight hilarity ensues.<br /><br />So, if I haven't made it clear enough, this movie is like a runway model: Beautiful, Self-Centered, and Boring.</p></body></html>

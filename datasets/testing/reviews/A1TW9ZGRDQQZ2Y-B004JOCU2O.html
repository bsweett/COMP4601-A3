<meta name="summary" content="A simple movie calls for my simple review"></head><body><p>Okay, let me describe Unstoppable. The plot is basic, the acting is secondary, and the whole semi-boring idea of a train on the loose kept me away from seeing Unstoppable in theaters until two weeks after its release. I watched it with a few of my relatives in town for Thanksgiving and everyone said that they enjoyed it, but it's one of those you can easily forget as soon as you make your way from the theater to your car. There will be little to no discussions afterwards, other than saying it was entertaining. I've seen plenty of movies where that alone is not a bad thing, though most don't have Denzel Washington in the lead role and cost over 100 million dollars. Denzel and Chris "Captain Kirk" Pine do share a couple of moments of good chemistry, on top of likeable performances. There are also some nice realistic action sequences mixed in with genuine moments of suspense. I'm going back and forth on a three or four star rating, but I think I'll have to take off a star for the sheer lack of depth. Still a fun ride worth catching.</p></body></html>

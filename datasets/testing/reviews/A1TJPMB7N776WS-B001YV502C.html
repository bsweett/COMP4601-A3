<meta name="summary" content="This is the End"></head><body><p>In the dreary, toxic, terrorist filled Britain circa 2027 of Alfonso Cuaron's "Children of Men" there is no hope...only despair and the television and billboards scream out at you about something called "Quietus: YOU decide when." In other words, the world is so rancid, the youngest person in the world, an 18 year old boy, has just died, there is mass infertility and basically the only choice left to you is when to die.<br /><br />Theo (a rumpled, emotionally depleted Clive Owen) was once a revolutionary, an activist but now he is merely a bureaucrat scratching out an existence when one day an old flame and current freedom fighter, Julian (Julianne Moore in a cameo) approaches him or more to the point has him kidnapped, bound and gagged and brought to her to ask a favor. This favor changes his life, gives him a little hope and introduces him to Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a young black woman who is unbelievably with child.<br /><br />Adapted from a story by the excellent writer, P.D. James, "Children of Men," offers more than a glimmer of hope and the idea that the world can be saved via a baby is a very Christian conceit. That this child is issued from the loins of, in the world of this film, a reviled, "immigrant" only makes the birth that much more resonant and thoughtful. There is a magical and very emotional scene towards the end of the film in which the revolutionaries are battling with the army, machine gun fire everywhere, bodies dropping like flies and Kee, Theo and the newborn baby descend a crumbling staircase and everything stops as army, revos and everyone one else realizes what Kee is carrying: a child yes but also a miracle, a beacon of hope, a hope for salvation. Interestingly enough, this scene, instead of being hokey, isn't because once Kee and child are outside the fighting immediately continues full bore: life goes on.<br /><br />"Children of Men" is a cautionary film and one that is particularly creepy yet visionary because it is not set some 100 years but a mere 20 years hence. The Britain here looks pretty much like it does today just seedier and unkempt: annihilation doesn't come by way of one big blast; it comes slowly yet inevitably creeping up upon us...little by little.</p></body></html>

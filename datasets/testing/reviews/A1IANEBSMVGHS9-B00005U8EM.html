We just saw it in 2005, 13 years after its original release. And that says a lot about how timeless it is: how much it can work regardless of the time you watch it.<br /><br />The bottom line of the movie is fairly basic, when you first think of it: Bill Murray, who plays the role of a news weatherman from Pittsburg, is off to cover Groundhog Day once more, an event he's had more of than he can stomach. After the day is over, every day from then on, starts to repeat the exact same Groundhog Day, over and over. This gives him time to look deep inside himself after numerous failed attempts of "escaping" the time loop, and perfect things from saying the right things to everyone (including his new producer, played by beautiful Andie Macdowell) to becoming an accomplished ice sculptor and piano player, and even attempting to save the lives of those doomed to have an accident and/or die that day.<br /><br />His evolution as a person and the way he begins to see things in a different light as new Groundhog Days keep coming at him once and again is enlightening. At the end, it's more than just a feel-food romantic comedy. It poses some interesting and significant questions for us to ponder: What would you do, if you could live a day over and over indefinitely? What would you make of it? To me, alongside "Lost in Translation" it easily ranks as Bill Murray's best movie, and overall, it's become one of my favorites.</p></body></html>

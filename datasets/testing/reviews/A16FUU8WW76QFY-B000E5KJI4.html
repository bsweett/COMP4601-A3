<meta name="summary" content="Huge, But a Disappointment..."></head><body><p>I really did look forward to "Troy", Wolfgang Peterson's epic version of the Iliad.  Alas, there is some good, and some bad in the monumental production ($200 million) of the Greek vs. Trojan saga. Overall I was disappointed.<br /><br />Did I mention that it is huge?  There are vast numbers of computer generated soldiers, 1000 Greek warships, and gigantic fortifications of Troy, the city under siege.  Somehow I just don't think this is what Homer had in mind when he wrote the epic poem more than 3,000 years ago.  It all looks pretty, but the film has no soul.<br /><br />A buffed-out Brad Pitt plays the legendary Greek warrior Achilles, but somehow the ancient Rambo just doesn't fit his style.  He seems like a pufferfish trying to fill the big shoes of this historic giant.  Pitt is a superb actor, but I agree with the critics who've stated that he is miscast in the role.  The one fellow who does very well in this film is Eric Bana, who gives his portrayal of the Trojan hero Hector a real conscience.  Hector sees what is coming, but his stature among the Trojan nobility means duty comes first-whatever the cost.  The other characters such as Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) are again physically attractive and uninteresting at the same time.  Peter O'Toole's King Priam says 'It is the will of the Gods' an awful lot.<br /><br />The story is by now well known to just about anyone who can read.  Let's just say that the interaction between mortal and gods in the book are dispensed with in favor of man vs. man conflict.  The romance between Paris and Helen, which is what is supposed to have started the war in the first place, is largely shunted aside in favor of the huge battle scenes-there is virtually no chemistry between Bloom and Kruger.<br /><br />The battle scenes are well done, but after awhile one begins to wonder if that is all there is to this film (my wife did).  I expected great things from "Troy", but got a lot of swords, spears, shields and arrows.  Did I say this movie is huge?  2 stars.</p></body></html>

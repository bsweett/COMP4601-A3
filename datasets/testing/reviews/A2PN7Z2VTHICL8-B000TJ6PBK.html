<meta name="summary" content="The short story is better than the movie"></head><body><p>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) writes "horror" guides to haunted places.  With several books under his belt, he's become numb to the supposedly haunted surroundings he puts himself into.  Until he hears about room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.  In order to check into room 1408, Mike must get his attorney involved, regarding some blue law that if the room requested is unoccupied it must be rented upon request.  It's the only way Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson), manager of the Dolphin, will rent the room to Enslin.<br /><br />Enslin checks in, under the caution from Olin that no one has ever lasted longer than one hour in the room.  At first, its an ordinary room.  But then things start happening.  The clock radio continuously goes off on its own, playing "We've Only Just Begun" each time.  The room warps, the pictures come alive, ghosts appear, the door locks itself, the thermostat malfunctions, and visions from Enslin's horrible past with his wife and daughter begin to infiltrate reality.<br /><br />Cusack's performance is excellent, as is Samuel Jackson and Tony Sheloub (Enslin's attorney).  This is probably Cusack's best performance of his career, very believable.<br /><br />I read the short story before watching the movie and actually wished that I hadn't.  I believe the movie would have intrigued me better if I hadn't seen the changes made to the story in order to make it movie material.  The creeping madness of the story was lost on film.  Too much of the fear was internal and hard to transfer to movie entertainment.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, it's just not a great movie either.  I recommend watching the movie before reading the story, and I recommend a rental before purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Video Quality"></head><body><p>Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I am reviewing the UK version of this:  Ben-Hur - Ultimate Collector's Edition [1959] [Blu-ray][Region Free] (3-disc set).<br /><br />The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent.  I give it a 9.98 on a 10.0 scale.  It looks perfect, except for some very, very fine grain that is barely noticeable in some scenes (mostly the sky).  I sit about 7 feet away from a 52" LCD, and I could hardly even see it.  You can pretty much say that there is no grain in this Blu-Ray movie.  Colors are fantastic.  Sometimes faces seemed a little soft.  But I am being very picky with these criticisms.  Blacks are black, without grain, and without any distortion.  This is the best video quality I've ever seen in an older movie, and I cannot remember any newer movie looking better.<br /><br />Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is adequate at most times, very good during a few instances.  Mostly there is no surround sound, but when you hear it, it is subtle.  Except at the end, when surround sound is strong.  There could have been more surround sound during the chariot race.<br /><br />Aspect ratio is wider than the usual 2.35:1.  I think it is listed as 2.76:1, but it looked more like 2.5:1 to me.<br /><br />This is a very long movie, on two discs.  The movie lasts 2 hours and 22 minutes on the first disc, and an hour and 20 minutes on the second disc, for a total of 222 minutes (3 hours and 42 minutes).  The first disc ends with an intermission.  At the beginning there is an Overture that last for several minutes.  There are no credits at the end.<br /><br />I did not look at the special features on the third disc.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Carol Burnett Wears Prada"></head><body><p>This movie does not accurately reflect the tone of the book, as a result of a very conscious decision not to do so.<br /><br />The concept of the book is that Andy's boss is "the devil".  She's awful.  She's a nightmare of a boss.  She intimidates all of her employees.  She is not just demanding with them, she is sadistic with them.  She lies to them, puts them through hell for her own amusement, constantly berates them, breaks them down, wrecks them.<br /><br />Meryl Streep in the movie is nothing like that.  She is the Disney version.  She is Carol Burnett at that time of the month, a bit cranky.<br /><br />The book's title villain could best be played by that snippy British lady who hosted The Weakest Link.  She would be perfect for the role of Miranda Priestly.<br /><br />If she were not available for the movie, I'd cast Cruella DeVille in the role.  She hasn't had a decent starring role since knocking us dead with 101 Dalmatians.<br /><br />The book made a statement about the fashion industry being a bad influence on young girls, turning them into self hating anorexics.  The movie did no such thing, and in fact took it in the opposite direction, showing a very positive image of the fashion industry.<br /><br />The most entertaining part of the book was simply left out.  I loved when Andy tried to get into her office building, in a mad hurry, loaded down with four Starbucks coffees and a few dozen scarves, and the security guard at the entrance locked the turnstile, refusing to let her in the building until she sang to him.  I can't believe they left that out.  It was the most fun thing in the book.  And it also set up the big finish in the book, when this same security guard showed respect for Andy as he played with the new girl in the same way he used to tease Andy.<br /><br />All in all, I wish they were truer to the book, because I think it was a very good book.  The movie was good in its way, and had a good ending, but I really wish that these film people would show more respect for the original author and I wish they didn't Disnify things.</p></body></html>

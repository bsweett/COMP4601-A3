This is an opinion of course, but there was nothing impressive about the first Hostel. It was balls to the wall blood and gore. It was filled with so much back to back disgusting images that made you cringe, but it lacked any real storyline or substance. It was like lukewarm water. I think the second installment has more of a storyline. Of course, it's predictable because we have seen this the first time around. I think they wanted to show you more about the organization. They wanted to show you that these were regular everyday people with families and normal jobs. On the other side, they also have a thirst for blood, a need to commit murder, and it's something that they are willing to pay very well to do. I found it amazing at how they were auctioning off the right to slaughter human beings like they were bidding on some concert tickets on Ebay. In my own opinion, I think the torture scenes were done with more finesse this time around (I don't know if people will quite get what I mean by that). Personally, I thought the scene with the naked woman slicing away at this innocent girl who's strung up like a chicken while bathing in her blood was meant to be sick, yet sensual, and somewhat erotic. I liked it! I also loved it when Bijou Phillips took the saw to the skull...beautiful! I also liked the ending where the hunted became the hunter, and ultimately turned the tables on this sick individual. That just goes to show money talks no matter what. Let's not forget the casteration scene...OMG CLASSIC! I know there isn't a woman alive that hasn't wanted to do that to an @ssh)le or two in their day. BRAVO! That part was..SIMPLY BRILLIANT! Lauren German has made a new fan out of me just based on that one scene alone. Not to mention, that made it worth the price of admission. I think ultimately what makes this movie work is the fact that it has so much more going for it than the first Hostel. Then again, I guess it just a matter of taste, and the first film left a bad taste in my mouth. Needless to say that since I was so overjoyed about the casteration scene my husband thinks I need help...I'm starting to agree.</p></body></html>

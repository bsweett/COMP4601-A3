<meta name="summary" content="Framed!"></head><body><p>Spielberg opens his holiday offering with a narrative frame of his protagonist appearing on an episode of "To Tell the Truth," intercutting shots of DiCaprio with 30-year-old footage of "guest" Kitty Carlisle and "host" Joe Garagiola from the actual television show. A nice device for "motivating" the story and establishing a sense of place and "realness"--but also one that sets up an expectation in the audience: will Kitty make the right call? <p>Spielberg's script never returns to this framing moment. A small detail perhaps, but this film, like most of Spielberg's work, takes great pride in the details, the verisimilitude of time and place--from Nehi pop bottles to Mitch Miller's television show to the continuous use on the soundtrack of popular music hits of the day. The problem is not so much that many of these details are anachronisms, or just sufficiently "off" to be bothersome, but that the slowness of plotting and thinness of characterization allowed me to dwell on them in the first place.  Hanks' role calls for him to be a straight-arrow caricature with his face upstaged by large glasses and his deportment deferring to his padded mid-section; DiCaprio, too, is about surfaces, incapable of suggesting any of the addictive giddiness of the successful imposter or con artist.  The biggest surprise in the film may well be the nuanced, sensitive performance of Christopher Walken who, as Frank's blustering, conning father, is at once wholly believable and sympathetic.<p>The film will no doubt do decent business. Not only is it a star vehicle for two of the screen's biggest attractions but Spielberg pulls on all of the middle-class family-value strings that are his trademark, and he combines the genre of the loveable imposter with that of the persevering bounty hunter who bonds with his praiseworthy prey. Moreover, unlike George W. and Osama, Hanks gets his man. But at 2 hours and 20 minutes the film feels like it owes us more--at the very least the satisfaction of knowing whether Kitty Carlisle got her man.</p></body></html>

Watching Citizen Kane alone isn't enough because it is not possible to see it of a masterpiece, and you will end up finding it an ordinary film. But knowing and understanding the background that led to Citizen Kane, it becomes more clear and understandable why it is a masterpiece. The film is very strong, powerful, and picturesque. Orson Welles did a brilliant job of portraying Charles Foster Kane, the evil magnate of immense power and wealth. The character was a villain because he never understood what it is like to be a human. When Charles failed to do that, he became a bigger and bigger monster until he fully realized that he actually hated what he had become of, and that's the brilliance behind Citizen Kane. It's not even about the sled per se but rather the huge concept behind that sled. Citizen Kane is about the loss of happiness that would never be regained. This is not as easy as it sounds, but Orson Welles did it. That was in 1941, and sixty-five years later, Citizen Kane is still a stunning picture.<br /><br />4/12: Orson Welles reaches the top on his first try, and he has never been the same since. Citizen Kane does put things into perspective. It is an important film for a numerous of reasons. Moreover, it's one of the best cinematographically shot picture. The film really says it all through its manipulation of vision to unfold a story. The controversy behind the film, most especially how the plot was constructed, is probably even bigger than the film per se, and that is what makes Citizen Kane a compelling picture to watch. All in all, Orson Welles will forever be famous for Citizen Kane, a legacy that he can never escape from.</p></body></html>

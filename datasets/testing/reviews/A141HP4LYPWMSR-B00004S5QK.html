Its story line deals with the earliest years of the motion picture industry when the painful transfer from silent movies to "talkies" was revolutionizing the world of entertainment, a time when the film industry was still trying to decipher the proper mix for the medium; action, adventure, romance, attractive women and handsome men? Not initially knowing for sure what the expectations of the audience were they simply threw in everything along with dancing, singing, extravagant stage numbers and a lot of "Old School" vaudeville routines.<br /><br />Recently viewing 'Singing in the Rain' on DVD now 56 years since it release I must admit that this homage to 'Old Hollywood' now seems so alien and remote in style and tenor when compared to modern day cinematic productions. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm left to wonder whether the song and dance of the 40's and 50's can still capture an adoring audience of new, younger fans?  If you're fascinated by the Golden Years of Hollywood and the styles and fashions of the time, this is a great glimpse into the glitz and glamour of those early days. If you aren't then this may not be the film for you.</p></body></html>

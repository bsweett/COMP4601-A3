<meta name="summary" content="Derivative of too many of films"></head><body><p>Chris Paolini, with author of the book that the film "Eragon" is based on, was only 15-years old when he began writing his fantasy fable.  While the age at which he wrote it is remarkable, the end product is predictable from someone that age.  It is a very shallow and derivative story that translates to an unsatisfying movie experience.<br /><br />"Eragon" tells the tale of a young boy, the titular Eragon (Ed Speleers), who comes into the possession of a magical dragon egg that hatches to become Saphira, the blue dragon.  With the help of Saphira and a former dragon-rider named Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon seeks to avenge his father's death and defeat the evil forces of Galbatorix (John Malkovich).<br /><br />The tale is as old as literary time and it has found itself manifested in such phenomenal tales as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.  So, while the tale is nothing original, a new angle on its telling can still make it memorable.<br /><br />Alas, "Eragon" fails in that regard.  This story is merely generic retelling with very unremarkable characters and adventures.  It is unfortunate that this film should be this way, but is it simply a product of an unpolished scribe (Paolini) whose work I'm not certain most directors could make into something compelling.</p></body></html>

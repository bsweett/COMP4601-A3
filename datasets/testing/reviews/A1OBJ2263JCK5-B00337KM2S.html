Both fine films in their own right. But lost in all the noisy hub-bub was another small, marvelous, nominated film. It had no space aliens or bombs going off. Instead it was just a well made, quiet, intelligent film about people called "Up in the Air".<br /><br />In "Up in the Air" we meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who makes his living traveling from company to company firing/laying off employees in the downturn economy. In other words, he's a professional hatchetman. He does his job with a certain sense of style and grace. He sets people adrift, gently. He travels without end, living a life, that is mainly made up of airport bars & lounges, rental car counters and chain hotels. What we hate about traveling he loves. His one kick in life seems to be collecting exclusive memberships in travel industry clubs, that offer big perks to those on the road and in the skies. What he dosn't have is a real home, wife, children or significant other ETC. Instead he espouses and lives an insular life without any true emotional responsiblities or commitments.<br /><br />This all changes when two women enter his life. One is Natalie (Anna Kendrick) a smart, energetic, young woman, who's business ideas could lead to the end of Ryan's nomadic wanderings (she wants employees fired via the internet). The other is Alex (Vera Farmiga), a mature, sexy business woman, who seems 'to get' Ryan's interests and lifestyle. Ryan and Alex meet at various junctures on the road for a series of sexual liasons. Together, these two interesting women turn Ryan's life upside down, causing him to finally question the path he has chosen for himself.<br /><br />Writer/Director, Jason Rietman has created a film, which is a wonderful character study. It portrays a man, who at first thinks he knows it all, but winds up eventually questioning everything. I love the way Reitman strips away his characters, until finally the truth is revealed. "Up in the Air" has a smart and funny script, which has razor-sharp, intelligent dialogue. It treats its characters with respect. I really love the fact that this movie dosn't try to tie everything up with a fake Hollywood ending. Instead the film leaves us on a more ambiguous note.<br /><br />The cast in this film is steller. George Clooney essentially gives the best performance of his career (so far). Anna Kendrick also gives a poised, well acted performance as the young upstart, who is both a pain and conscious for Clooney's character. But the real discovery of the film is actress, Vera Farmiga. She really gives a "star is born" type of performance. Its hard to match an actor like Clooney, charisma-wise, but Vera Farmiga manages to do it. Her sexy, smart business woman really jumps out at you. Its an amazing performance. I predict big things for this actress in the future.<br /><br />I think "Up in the Air" was one of the best movies I saw all year. Its both heartfelt and humorous. A great piece of storytelling. Give it a try!</p></body></html>

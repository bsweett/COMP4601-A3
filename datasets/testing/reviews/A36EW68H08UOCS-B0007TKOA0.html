Paul plays Miles, a middle-aged 8th grade english teacher who writes good novels that his agent can't find a publisher for.  Miles is also an amateur wine expert, and enjoys the spirits a little more than is good for him.  You get the sense that much of the unhappiness in his life he has brought on himself from his drinking, and his unhappiness only makes him drink so...  Despite all this, Miles seems an honestly good-hearted fellow and I felt myself pulling for him.<br /><br />Church plays Jack, an actor who once played a Doctor on a soap opera, but now can only get work recording incredibly fast "fine print" material at the end of car dealer ads.  He and Paul were roommates as freshmen in college, and although Paul has grown into a sad, balding geek, Jack retains enough of those good looks that got him on a soap - and he can't help but use those good looks to come on to the prettiest girl he spies in every building he walks into.<br /><br />Jack is now engaged, and Paul wants them to have a final bachelor's week in California wine country.  Paul wants his friend to develop a little appreciation for the wine.  Jack wants them both to meet willing women.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen plays Maya, who is a waitress working her way through Horticulture grad school.  She has met Miles on his previous trips to wine country, but what Miles doesn't know initially is that pretty Maya was divorced last year.  Maya is also an amateur wine expert and everyone in the film can tell that they are soulmates.<br /><br />At another winery they meet Sandra Oh as Stephanie, pouring wine and acknowledging to randy Jack that she is a bad girl and "needs to be spanked".  Jack pours on the soap actor charm and leaves out the fact that he's getting married on Saturday.<br /><br />Without being preachy, the movie provides a stark contrast between Jack, who is interested in having as much hot sweaty bedroom encounters as possible, and Miles, who is dumpy and middle-aged and hesitantly pursues a much deeper relationship with Maya.<br /><br />There are no moments when I laughed my head off, but the clever screenplay made me chuckle appreciatively every couple of minutes.  These people and their dialogue seemed very real and familiar.<br /><br />By the end you hope Jack will have learned a lesson of sorts, and you hope for good things for Miles and Maya.</p></body></html>

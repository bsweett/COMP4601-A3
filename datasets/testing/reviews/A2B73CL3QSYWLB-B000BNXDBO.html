<meta name="summary" content=""Harold and Kumar Get The Munchies"(British Title)"></head><body><p>Just what the doctor ordered!  Some good clean raunchy intelligently dumb fun.  The easy laughs that this film delivers are just the tonic for these long cold depressing winter nights.  In the tradition of Cheech and Chong, Jay and Silent Bob(with a little more brains) comes the ethnic underachieving stoners Harold(John Cho) and Kumar(Kal Penn) in pursuit of the elusive, in this case the delectable White Castle hamburgers.  Cho and Penn have such an appealing rapport that I hope this film developes a deserved cult following so that they may be reunited in future ventures.  Neil Patrick Harris also lampoons his "Doogie Howser" character with hilarious results.  Since I did not see this film in the theatre I would like to know what makes it "the extreme unrated version".  My experience with these discs that tantalize us with the "unrated" tag is that there isn't much verboten in these versions except for a few superfluous scenes that add nothing to the original film.</p></body></html>

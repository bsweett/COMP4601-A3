<meta name="summary" content="Believe the hype"></head><body><p>Even while this was in the theatres, reviews and critics were praising this movie.  I, on the other hand, was afraid to believe the hype.  Even after talking myself into renting this, it sat around the house for days because I still couldn't bring myself to believe that this film would actually be good.  But boy am I glad I finally hit the play button.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed Rocky Balboa and it's strange how he feels like an old friend I haven't seen in a while.  I'm impressed with Rocky's wisdom and understand his heartbreak over Adrian.  Afterall, I've known her for thirty years too.  In no time, I'm quite charmed by Rocky's humbleness and inspired by his unconquerable soul.  The script is a bit laid back and not over the top like Rocky 2 thru 4. (I like to pretend that 5 never happened.)  In short, this is a wonderful film about a remarkable character.  You won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Average Arnold SF"></head><body><p>A DVD I have in my collection mainly because I'm a big Sci-Fi fan. No one scene really stands out in my mind, none of the scenes were great, but none were terrible either. They work well taken as a whole. None of the  preformances were outstanding and pretty standard Arnold action as well. An  interesting plot to a degree that makes you wonder what is supposed to be  real and what is imaginary.</p></body></html>

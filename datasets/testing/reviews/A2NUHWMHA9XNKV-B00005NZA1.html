It has Bruce Willis from the Sixth Sense who instead of a doctor person plays a security guard who survives a train crash without a scrath on him but then discoveres something different about him later in the movie or somewhere after the crash. Samuel L. Jackson is creepy as Elijah who's obsessed with comics and believes that the security guard is some kind of 'super hero'. The ending gets good and is shocking and expected. The movie was alright.</p></body></html>

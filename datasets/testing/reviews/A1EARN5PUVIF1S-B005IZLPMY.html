<meta name="summary" content="Marvel Mayhem Continues"></head><body><p>The damage that Marvel has wreaked on the multiplex continues with this visually arresting but ineptly executed clunker.<br /><br />The two leads, Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell, look good in uniform but are woefully devoid of charisma.  Casting directors, just because an alleged actor or actress has a nice body, it doesn't mean he or she can carry a movie, even a special effects extravaganza like this one!<br /><br />Only the ever resourceful Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci make much of an impression here, and that would be -- look what good actors will do for a paycheck...<br /><br />The director Joe Johnston must take a large part of the blame for the lack of suspense here.  I liked his "Wolfman" and "Honey I Shrunk the Kids", but this film must take its place among his growing list of misses.<br /><br />Really, American film makers are going to have to find more worthy sources of inspiration than Comicon -- or the mortgages on their McMansions.<br /><br />Finally this DVD appears to be devoid of any extras, but in this case that's probably not an issue.  I did wonder, however, how CGI managed to make such a transformation in Evans' body from 90-pound weakling to hulk.  I am guessing the color green played a role.</p></body></html>

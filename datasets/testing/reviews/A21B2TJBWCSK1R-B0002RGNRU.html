His feature film debut was the Charlie Kaufman-penned Human Nature that, by most accounts, was simply awful. Maybe Gondry just didn't connect with the material or figure out a way to bring it successfully to life. His second feature and second crack at a Kaufman screenplay, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, was met, initially, with trepidation. By most accounts, he's directed one of the most original films in years.<br /><br />The Collector's Edition comes with an attractive booklet filled with glossy photos and excerpts from enthusiastic reviews praising the movie.<br /><br />The first disc starts with "A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," a promo with soundbite interviews and clips from the movie. The cast and crew talk about the characters and the unique nature of the script.<br /><br />"A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry" is an entertaining dialogue between the two men mixed with rehearsal footage. They talk about the hardest day of the shoot when they got into a heated argument that they can laugh about now.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Gondry and Kaufman. They had pitched the idea for the movie as early as 1998 and not surprisingly had a tough time finding a studio willing to take a chance.<br /><br />There are seven minutes of deleted scenes. Unfortunately, there is no context for the footage of a commentary track to explain why they were cut out. It almost simulates the mind erosion that Joel experiences in the movie. What do these scenes mean?<br /><br />There is a music video for "Light and Day" by Polyphonic Spree that tweaks footage from the movie in an unsettling way.<br /><br />There is also a funny commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the fictitious company that erases people's memories.<br /><br />The second disc begins with "Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry", a 20-minute look at the director's creative process. It is amazing how much of the film's more fantastical images were done without CGI, just good ol' fashioned editing, lighting or forced perspective shots.<br /><br />"Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue" examines how a specific scene was put together, mostly through CGI with the sound effects and score explored in detail.<br /><br />"A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry" is a dialogue between the actress and the filmmaker. She was surprised that Gondry cast her as she was known mostly for reserved period dramas.<br /><br />Finally, there are almost 19-minutes of additional deleted or extended footage. Mostly, it is bits and pieces that were trimmed from existing scenes. We even see Joel's previous girlfriend, Naomi, who is only mentioned in the final cut.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a film about how precious our memories are and how we should savour them while we can because our minds erase them gradually over time on their own anyway. Kaufman has established an ingenious premise: the notion of selectively erasing your memories and reliving a relationship again and again. The story actually starts at the end and works its way back-think of a romantic comedy version of Memento.</p></body></html>

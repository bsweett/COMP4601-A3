<meta name="summary" content="The Darjeeling Limited"></head><body><p>'The Darjeeling Limited' is another kooky gem from Wes Anderson and if you know 'The Life Aquatic' or 'Royal Tenenbaums', then you'll know what to expect. The direction is very stylised but completely captivating. Owen Wilson is hilarious, as are Adrian Brody and Jason Schwartzman. The relationship between the brothers is very believable and the dialogue and their familiarity add real appeal to the overall story. There are many wonderful scenes and I found Brody's dry delivery of some lines only heightened the humour in them. The storyline is charming, about reconnecting with family and resolving past issues, and it meanders along at a gentle pace, but manages to hold you attention for the whole duration. There is also a short film at the start involving Schwartzman and Natalie Portman which is both touching and a serendipitous addition. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to all fans of Anderson's past work.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

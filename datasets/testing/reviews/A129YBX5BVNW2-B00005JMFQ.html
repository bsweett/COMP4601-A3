Because if you haven't, you need to...<br /><br />Having reviewed so many 'oldies' transferred to Blu Ray and been elevated fifty-per-cent of the time/disappointed the other half - it's a real delight to report that here is a genuine upgrade from every previous version. Suddenly, the film feels all grown up - the print is incredibly clear - and it adds so much to your enjoyment of the movie. There isn't a part of this rather lovely little gem that 'doesn't' seem improved to me.<br /><br />The extras are the same as the 2003 DVD - Deleted Scenes and Music Of (with introductions from Richard Curtis), Kelly Clarkson and Billy Mack Videos (Billy Mack is Bill Nighy's character), a Feature Length Commentary with Director and Writer Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangster (Neeson's son in the movie). The picture quality for these clips is old actually and hardly high-def, but they are informative and hugely entertaining (especially when the galaxy of stars are talking - Liam Neeson and Laura Linney so enjoying themselves).<br /><br />Apart from being wonderful to look at, you also forget what a great film it is - a huge upbeat pick-me-up of a thing - and hopeful in a way that seems to elude Hollywood stories so much these days. And it's so funny too - Martin Freeman and Joanna Page lying naked on top of each other as the rehearse making out for a skin flick ("Judy this is a real pleasure. It's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to..."), Bill Nighy on the Ant & Dec show "...kids, here's an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs. Become a pop star and they give you them for free!" and the ever-hopeful Colin as he embarks for the States to meet girls who will all helplessly fall for his English accent - and they do (title above).<br /><br />So there you have it - great actors, clever intertwining stories, witty dialogue, genuinely funny and touching moments - even sadness and a bit of heartbreak - "Love Actually" is a bit of a British gem frankly. And on BLU RAY it's a winner. And cheap too.<br /><br />Recommended like a night in with a saucy minx in Number 10...<br /><br />BLU RAY Credits:<br />VIDEO: 1080p High-Definition Widescreen 2.35:1 aspect<br />AUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and French, Italian, German, Spanish and Latin American Spanish DTS-Surround 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English SDH, French, Canadian French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin American Spanish and Dutch<br /><br />PS: for other superb BLU RAY reissues (including full restorations) - see also my reviews for:<br />"The Italian Job", "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning", "The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner", "North By Northwest", "Cool Hand Luke", "The Dambusters", "The Prisoner - The Complete (UK TV) Series In High Definition", "Braveheart", "Snatch", "The Ladykillers", "The African Queen", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "Back To The Future Trilogy", "Brief Encounter" and "Kelly's Heroes"</p></body></html>

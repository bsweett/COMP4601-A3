<meta name="summary" content="Failure is not an option"></head><body><p>Perhaps no single event in the history of spaceflight (save for the horrible "Challenger" tragedy) was as humbling as the near-catastrophic saga of Apollo 13. When an oxygen tank ruptured and exploded in the service module as the three-man crew of Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were within 50,000 miles of a touchdown on the surface of the Moon, not only was the lunar landing scrubbed, but there was the strong possibility that neither they nor their ship would last long enough until re-entry.<p>Ron Howard's gripping 1995 epic shows us how the tragedy unfolded before an America that had become complacent, and also how some very sharp minds at Mission Control ensured that this most perilous spaceflight had a triumphant conclusion. Based on the book "Lost Moon" by Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, APOLLO 13 gets great performances from the three-man team of Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon, as well as first-rate support from Gary Sinise (as Ken Mattingly, the initial command module pilot who was beached because of a feared rubella infection that never materialized), Kathleen Quinlan (as Marilyn Lovell), and Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz who urges his Mission Control team on by telling them "Failure is not an option."<p>APOLLO 13 gives credit to both the crew and the entire Mission Control staff for having made the flight come to a successful conclusion when it could have ended in irreversable tragedy. Scientifically accurate special effects and James Horner's Copland-influenced music score are the icing on this, one of the best movies of the Nineties.</p></body></html>

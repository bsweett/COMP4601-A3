<meta name="summary" content="If you think that this movie is way to good to be a foreing film then EAT YOUR HEART OUT!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>MAN This movie is SPECTACULAR!!!!!<br /><br />First class special effects, GREAT story and storyline (just like the anime films by Miyazaki), VERY good acting, SUPERB cinematography and BLOOD AND GORE!!!!!!!! YEEAAAAAAH!!!!<br /><br />Another thing:<br /><br />WHY SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS MOVIES IS A SPANISH DUB VERSION???!!<br /><br />THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IS SPANISH!! THIS IS NOT A DUB!!<br /><br />I don't care if you don't want to read the subtitles, but I understand that there are some animes and Hong Kong movies that have the same quality and no english dub as this one, BUT NO ONE COMPLAINS ABOUT THAT!!!<br /><br />Come on, people! Most of the foreing countries watch the Hollywood movies with their subtitles, why can't you do the same thing????? and if you are not used to hear or watch spanish films then this is a great start!<br /><br />If one of the reasons to the problem is that people are confused if this movie is a hollywood film or a foreing film then read my review's title.<br /><br />P.S: Im hispanic, asi que estoy muy orgulloso que hayan hecho una pelicula en espa&ntilde;ol la cual tenga la misma calidad que las de Hollywood! Creo que esta es la primera! Que viva el cine en espa&ntilde;ol!<br /><br />Adios.</p></body></html>

The actor that plays Ray Charles is Jamie Foxx, and sincerely, you forget that he is playing a role because after a few minutes of watching the movie you begin to believe that he IS Ray Charles. I guess that nothing better can be said in behalf of an actor...<br /><br />You might be asking yourself what kind of movie is this. Well, in my opinion it is an excellent one, due to the fact that it entertains but also informs the spectator about another era, and a musician that lived in it. That is specially important in the case of young movie-goers, who aren't necessarily aware of what segregatation was like in the 50's, or what kind of gestures were needed to bring it down. You may have read about it in history books, but seeing it shown in a good film makes you understand segregation in its stark reality, and thank to God (and people like Ray, and many others) that times have changed.<br /><br />But what about Ray?. Impossible as it may seem to many, some people (me included) didn't know much about him before seeing this film. If that is the case, this movie is the right way to be introduced to this American music legend, because it pictures Ray as a person with lots of virtues, but also many defects. He is shown as brave enough to overcome the difficulties that arose from the fact that he was blind and black (in times when segregation was a reality in the south of USA), and to pursue his dream of becoming a well-known musician. However, we also see his struggles with drug, and the less than stellar way in which he treated the women in his life (for example his wife, played by Kerry Washington, and his mistress, played by Regina King). He is flawed, but capable of gestures that make him great, for instance refusing to sing in places where the audience was segregated. He was somewhat self-absorbed, but he was a musical genius that created his own style and helped to develop soul music..<br /><br />As we watch "Ray", we are allowed to accompany him in a travel through his memories, from his days as a young boy living with his mother (played by Sharon Warren), to the days when he had already achieved great fame but had many problems dealing with it. The director (Taylor Hackford) manages to do that aided by the songs Ray Charles composed at different times in his career, an interesting way to link different events of significance in Ray's life.<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that this is the kind of movie you must see. If you are already a Ray Charles' fan, you will love this movie about his life. If you aren't, you are highly likely to become one. In any case, you will enjoy it enormously :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty much on par with the first film"></head><body><p>If you dug the first Resident Evil film, you'll most likely dig Resident Evil: Apocalypse even more.  Taking place right after the end of the first film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself allied with a few survivors as they try to escape Raccoon City and the unending zombie onslaught.  Paul W.S. Anderson, who had directed the first film, wrote this sequel which is capably directed by first timer Alexander Witt.  The bigger budget allows for better special effects, a more expansive environment, and the appearance of fan favorite video game monster Nemesis.  Video game characters Jill (the oh so hot Sienna Guillory) and Carlos (The Mummy's Oded Fehr) are introduced, and the solid cast is rounded out by Mike Epps, Jared Harris, and Thomas Kretschmann.  However, Apocalypse is really nothing too special, and at times it is quite predictable, although the twist ending is a nice touch, and the door is left open (again) to another sequel.  It's not a waste of film as Roger Ebert described it as upon it's release, but it will depend on the viewer whether or not this is worth a look.</p></body></html>

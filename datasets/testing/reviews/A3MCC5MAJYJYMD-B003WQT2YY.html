The film 'Amadeaus' is a prime example of how a completely fabricated story can pass off as something genuine.  The film has created a bogus story for the sake of drama and sensationalism.  It makes Mozart look like some God who had everything easy and then goes on to say his father's death had something to do with his death.  Hollywood will anyting to create mystery out of nothing.  Most embarassing of all, Mozart's wife calls him "Wolfy".  Boy, I'm sure people in the 1700's talked like that!!</p></body></html>

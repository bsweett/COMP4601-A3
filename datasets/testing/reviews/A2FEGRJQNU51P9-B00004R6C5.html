<meta name="summary" content="a masterpiece of american cinema"></head><body><p>Gregory Peck was entirely deserving of the recognition that he got for playing Atticus Finch (including the Oscar for Best Actor), the strongest role in the movie was actually that of Scout (played by Mary Badham).  Badham was nominated for an Academy Award, and I feel that it is on the strength of Scout that this movie was carried.  While Peck may have been the moral backbone of the movie, it is Badham that is the heart of the movie and whom the film truly does revolve around.  <p>To Kill a Mockingbird is the film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same title.  The story deals with racism and morality in a very humanistic way.  When a black man is accused of raping a white woman, Atticus Finch takes the case to defend Tom Robinson (the man accused).  This is a story about race relations as well as community relations and in the end, about doing the right thing.  The house next to the Finch home is the Radley house.  There are stories and rumors and prejudices against the hidden Radley boy, Boo Radley (the screen debut of Robert Duvall).  Somehow, the stories about the Radley home come together with the trial of Tom Robinson and the moment where Scout gently says, "hey Boo" is truly a beautiful moment.  <p>I could probably heap praise on this movie until my fingers can't type anymore, but I am simply going to end by saying this is a movie than anybody who wants to watch a great movie needs to see this.  Both the book and the movie are truly American classics.</p></body></html>

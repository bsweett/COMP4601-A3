<meta name="summary" content="hmmm, pretty decent"></head><body><p>I like a few Adam Sandler films, and this is one of them.  I admit I mostly liked the Longest Yard because I'm a big WWE fan, and the film featured stars like "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, The Great Khali, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash (and probably a few others).  It was, however, disappointing that Steve Austin was only featured in a few shots.  He should have played a bigger part.  Despite all the wrestler appearances, I would have probably liked this film anyway.<br /><br />I'm no fan of Chris Rock, but even he was pretty tolerable for the most part.  He played a nice guy in the film (well, as nice as a prisoner can be) and his parts were all pretty decent.<br /><br />I had to laugh at the end of the film when the guards thought Adam Sandler was trying to escape, so they pointed a gun to his head and thought about shooting, but changed their mind when they realized he was only walking away to pick up a football.  It was an unintentionally funny moment.<br /><br />The film did a respectable job turning a bunch of prisoners into football players.  They actually spent a good amount of time building them up, and training them, and correctly showing them how to play the game.  Overall, good movie.</p></body></html>

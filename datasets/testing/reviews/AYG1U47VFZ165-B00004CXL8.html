<meta name="summary" content="As Good As It Got"></head><body><p>I hate to admit it, but I've never been a fan of Jack Nicholson.<p>Also, I've never been smitten with the lovely Helen Hunt.<p>Lastly, Greg Kinnear has always been REALLY too smarmy for me.<p>However, somehow AS GOOD AS IT GETS has a special place in my heart.<p>Nicholson is absolutely fabulous as the neurotic writer who, due to circumstances wildly beyond his control, has to not so much step outside of his comfort zone as he has to destroy the barriers that have isolated him from society when the people that make up the routine of his life  -- eating at the corner restaurant, pestering the gay neighbors -- start to come apart at the seams.  The crusty exterior, we learn, is just a facade, and the man underneath -- while not perfect -- accepts that life is worth living ... as good as it gets.<p>Helen Hunt is absolutely radiant in the role as the corner shop waitress who's forced to deal with Nicholson's habits ... and, much to her surprise and the audience, she begins to experience true emotion for the man.<p>Greg Kinnear plays the struggling artist role to perfection.  He has bouts of great self-esteem countered by comic moments of heightened anxiety, and the subtlety he brings to his portrayal is may be all-too-Hollywood but is surprisingly human.<p>A perfect mix, this film is about AS GOOD AS IT GETS.</p></body></html>

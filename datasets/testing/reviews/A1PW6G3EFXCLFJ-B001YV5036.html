Set during the early years of the Depression, Braddock (Russell Crowe) struggles to keep his family warm and fed and together while fighting for $50 a match and working as a dock hand loading ships. This film has that same feel-good aspect about it that SEABISCUIT does. What is amazing is that in 2005, a year berift of hardly any good movies, CINDERELLA MAN wasn't nominated for best film. Of the films that were nominated, I have seen CRASH but have only read about the others. CRASH is a well-made but depressing movie that puts a negative spin on race relations in the US. CINDERELLA MAN, on the other hand, extolls such values as family, hard work and reluctance to take a handout from the government. It is basically the story of what anyone can do who believes in himself or herself in this country and who is willing to work hard enough and sacrifice. Maybe this message was not negative enough for Oscar voters but it gets my vote as best picture of the year. The fight scenes are brilliantly directed by Ron Howard and Crowe and Rene Zellweger as his wife, Mae, give appropriately low-key performances of folks trying to manage in hard times, but Paul Giamatti (SIDEWAYS) steals the show as Braddock's fight agent and he deserved Best Supporting Actor for his work in this film. CINDERELLA MAN is a good family picture with a good family message and -- it really happened.</p></body></html>

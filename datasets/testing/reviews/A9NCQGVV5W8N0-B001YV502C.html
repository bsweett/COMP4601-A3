<meta name="summary" content="Hope For The Future?"></head><body><p>Quite simply put, this is the most amazing piece of cinema that I've seen in a while and certainly the most plausible vision of a future Anglican dystopia yet committed to film. It's an instant addition to my favourite films of all time. Its difficult to do the experience of watching it justice in words - if you can imagine a more humane Kubrick or perhaps Andrei Tarkovsky or Elem Klimov working within the perimeters (but not conventions) of the British/American film-making lexicon, then you're getting close. It takes a thousand images from the contemporary world that you're familiar with and weaves them into a tapestry of such alarmingly plausible disquiet that you can't help but be drawn in. If you're a fan of film-making you can consider it a 'must-own' for the simple reason that it contains two of the most hauntingly evocative scenes ever committed to celluloid - one is an attack on a car full of people on an open road, the other is a pitched battle that grinds to a halt in order to provide safe passage for innocents caught in the crossfire. Stunning stuff. We need more films like it.</p></body></html>

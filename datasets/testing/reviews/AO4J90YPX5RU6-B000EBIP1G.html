<meta name="summary" content="Under cooked!!"></head><body><p>Am I the only one that thinks this looks like straight to DVD Disney fluff!! It is for sure a children's movie.. nothing here for adults I just came to find out! The effects are under cooked.. this includes the unfinished looking make-up, set decor, CGI, ect.. oh and dont forget the bad green screen. Just not impressed what so ever! So to end this right now I say.. if you have preschoolers to entertain.. go for it but, they will proberly get bored. So who is this movie made for?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SEEN AND HEARD AS NEVER BEFORE"></head><body><p>I AM REVIEWING THE NEW THX DOLBY DIGITAL ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN VERSION OF THIS FILM. ANYTHING PRIOR WAS OF POOR QUALITY. BEFORE I GET INTO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF THE FILM MY FIRST COMMENTS ARE ON THE REMASTERING OF THE PICTURE AND SOUND. THE PICTURE IS BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND THE SOUND(CONSIDERING THE ERA ITS FROM)IS CLEAR AND RICH WITH NUANCE. I HAVE VIEWED "BENEATH" MANY TIMES BUT NEVER WITH SUCH CLARITY. ITS GREAT. I ACTUALLY APPRECIATED THE FILM MORE BECAUSE OF THIS.<br />  AFTER "BENEATH" THE APE FILMS WENT DOWN HILL AND ARE NOT WORTH GETTING INTO. "BENEATH" IS CREATIVE SCI-FI ALL AROUND. ALL OF THE POST APOCOLIPTIC WORLD SCENES STILL HOLD UP ALTHOUGH DONE WITH A LESSER TECHNOLOGY. I NEVER THOUGHT BRENT GOING BACK TO APE CITY WITH NOVA WORKED WELL BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR THE LATE SIXTIES AUDIENCE WHO STILL HAD TO "GET IT'. A BIG TRIVIA POINT IS THAT IT IS CLAIMED BY BRENT ACCORDING TO HIS SHIPS CLOCK THAT IT IS THE YEAR 3955. IN THE ORIGINAL, TAYLORS SHIP'S CLOCK READ 3978. COULD BE A MISTAKE OR A GEEKY TIME WARP EXPLAINATION FOR THAT. I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYONE EVER COMMENT ON THAT.<br />  THE COMBINATION OF UNDERGROUND MUTANTS, THE SUBWAY, JF'S INTENSE ACTING, THE BARREN WASTELAND, APES ON THE MARCH AND HESTONS SOLID ENHANCEMENT TO THE FILM SAVE IT FROM ANY MAKEUP SHORTCOMINGS, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY AT TIMES IT HAS. THE LAST HOUR IS EXCELLENT AS A TRUE CLIMAX BUILDS WITH SOME OF THE BEST SPINE TINGLING ACTION YOU COULD ASK FOR. ITS ALL THERE. "YOU BLEW IT UP!! (FROM THE FIRST FILM)  CHECK OUT THE ROTARY PAY PHONE IN THE OLD SUBWAY. TALK ABOUT A TIME TRIP. ENJOY.</p></body></html>

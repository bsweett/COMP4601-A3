They don't know where they are or why, but they do know that one of them has to kill the other in order to live. As their ordeal progresses, secrets leak out, tying the men to one another, and to the man known as the Jigsaw Killer, who punishes those who are insensitive to others, who prey on their weaknesses. A haunting thriler with many twists and turns, as well as a rich character study about the nature of sin, redemption, voyeurism and the inhumanity that we all are guilty of just by going through our everyday lives mindlessly.</p></body></html>

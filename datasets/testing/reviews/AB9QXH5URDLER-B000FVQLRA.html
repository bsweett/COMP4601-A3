<meta name="summary" content="Truth is Better Than Fiction"></head><body><p>Why live in a make believe world when the real world is so much more intriguing?<p>This film tells the story of a pianist who struggled for survival during the Warsaw Getto Uprising in WWII.  I was glued to my seat.  The book from which this film was adapted is more of a journal than a novel.  It was written just after the event, so the memories depicted are fresh.<p>The bonus menu is also strong.  The film peaked my interest to learn more and the bonus specials filled in the missing gaps, complete with shots of the main character in old age and film clips and photos from the Warsaw uprising.<p>This is not a "feel good" movie.  You won't smile, but you will come away a little richer.</p></body></html>

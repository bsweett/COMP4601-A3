Superior, mind-boggling special effects rule the day as Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his faithful band of awakened humans continue to battle Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the rest of the machines not only on the Matrix, but in the real world as well.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) reprise their roles from the original film and are joined by newcomers to the series; Jada Pinkett Smith (Niobe), Harold Perrineau (Link), Lambert Wilson (Merovingian), Monica Bellucci (Persephone) and Gloria Foster (The Oracle) to name a few. I particularly enjoyed the addition of Lambert Wilson and the lovely Ms. Bellucci. I wish they had made greater use of her Persephone role. It would've made for a great love triangle subplot with her, Neo and Trinity. A missed opportunity I guess.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers have delivered with another wonderful mix of overt futuristic technology layered over a richly textured metaphysical landscape. Not as good as the first, but oh so close.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Women's movie ... but pretty good"></head><body><p>This movie follows an increasingly common theme.  Men are pretty much all pigs.  The only meaningful intimacies are between women.  The Johnny Depp character is very shallow and superfluous and provides only an unconvincing heterosexual love interest for Juliete Binoche.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it's an engaging film and worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great Hitchcock thriller, a great DVD."></head><body><p>"Rear Window," of course, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most glittering masterpieces, and the great thing about this DVD is that it goes a long way in showing us why. First, it presents the film in a beautiful new restoration, with glowing colors and crisp picture definition. Second, it provides a fascinating feature in the Extras section, describing how Hitchcock designed the set--one of the most ingenious production designs in cinematic history. It contains interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, including several of the neighbors on whom L.B. "Jeff" Jefferies (James Stewart) trained his binoculars. The featurette fills us with renewed awe at Hitchcock, one of the most meticulous directors ever as well as one of the most brilliant, and at how he could keep such myriad, tiny details in his head as he made this film.<br /><br />And the film itself? I can only add my few droplets to the oceans of deserved praise it has received over the last half-century. What perfect casting: like a master chef, Hitchcock blends the disparate styles of Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr into something delicious and unique. What superbly timed suspense: if your pulse rate doesn't exceed 200 beats per minute as Stewart listens to Burr's footsteps up the stairs, growing closer and closer in a measured beat, you need to see your doctor immediately. And of course the first appearance of Kelly, a breathtaking blonde beauty arising as if from a dream, will haunt you forever. If you've never seen "Rear Window," you won't regret buying this DVD sight unseen. If you have seen it, I can't imagine you wouldn't want this DVD immediately for your collection.</p></body></html>

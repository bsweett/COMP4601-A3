<meta name="summary" content="This is the day you ALMOST caught Captain Jack Sparrow!"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow and he does a terrific job as usual. This movie was alot easier to follow than at worlds end was. This made it alot easier to just enjoy the movie. Now the 3D was not all that spectacular, that is why I only gave it 4 stars. If it would of had better 3D effects 5 stars no doubt.</p></body></html>

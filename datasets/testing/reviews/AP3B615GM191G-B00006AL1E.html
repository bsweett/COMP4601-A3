<meta name="summary" content="Some Quick Thoughts About Each Film..."></head><body><p>I consider the "Back To The Future" stable of films to be perhaps the best film trilogy ever conceived.  Here are a few of my thoughts on each individual film...<br /><br />Part One (*****): A film that completely defies the word genre, containing action, adventure, romance, drama, and a heaping dose of comedy to top things off!  Enough clever/subtle sight gags to keep you intrigued after multiple viewings!<br /><br />Part Two (*****): Basically a two-hour extension of the first installment...and what more could BTTF fans ask for?!  Still incredibly genre-diverse, while delving even deeper into the back (and future!) stories of your favorite characters.<br /><br />Part Three (****): Some of the jokes begin to fall a bit flat, but still a solid ending to the trilogy.  Viewers will appreciate some deeper character-development on an emotional level that was lacking from the first two films.<br /><br />If you have never immersed yourself in this incredible trilogy, please do so soon...before you run out of TIME!</p></body></html>

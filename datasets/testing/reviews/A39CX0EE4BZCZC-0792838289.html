<meta name="summary" content="Politics Aside, A Riveting Film"></head><body><p>Suffice to say the movie had messages from both the Right and Left - with both Conservative and Liberal villains, but politics aside, the film boasts an involving story that keeps your interest for most of the two hours and six minutes.<br /><br /> It featured some very interesting characters who are fascinating to watch. That includes the supporting roles. It didn't hurt to have John Frankenheimer direct, either. His films usually were outstanding.<br /><br />I thought Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey had the best parts of the film. The only really stupid and/or annoying character in the movie was played by Janet Leigh. Her romance scenes with Frank Sinatra added nothing to this riveting film. Eliminated, it would have made for a tighter, even better movie. Also, Sinatra found out too easily where Harvey was hiding in Madison Square Garden. Nobody could figure it out that fast! Nonetheless, the ending was a bit surprising and I won't spoil it for anyone who has not seen this.<br /><br />The movie has endured the test of time and, from what I hear, would have been best left on its own instead of watering down the name of this film with an insipid re-make.<br /><br />This is "The Manchurian Candidate" version you want to see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brad Pitt as Achilles"></head><body><p>Brad Pitt stars as the legendary Greek warrior Achilles in "Troy," an epic drama full of action and adventure based on Homer's Iliad.  Lovesick Prince Paris has run off with Helen to his land of Troy.  Helen's husband wants her back, and convinces Greek King Agamemnon to "launch a thousand ships" and bring Helen back.  The King enlists the aid of Achilles, and the battle begins.<br /><br />On the plus side, the movie looks just great, with spectacular sets and thousands of soldiers who fight gallantly.  The supporting cast is wonderful; in particular Eric Bana as Paris' brother, Hector, and Peter O'Toole as his father, King Prium.  Their scenes are the best in the film.<br /><br />On the down side, Brad Pitt, while ruggedly handsome and sincere, never really loses himself in the character of an ancient Greek hero; you can't forget he's Brad Pitt.  The actress who plays Helen is not the classic beauty one would expect and looks like so many modern starlets.  The battle scenes are for the most part filmed in close-ups and edited in very quick shots, which makes them look blurry and chaotic, and you may need a scorecard to keep up with all the characters.<br /><br />Troy has the look and feel of a good epic, but isn't a great one.  If you enjoy sword and sandal war movies with handsome leading men, you'll like Troy.  Brad Pitt is delicious eye-candy and that just may be good enough after all.</p></body></html>

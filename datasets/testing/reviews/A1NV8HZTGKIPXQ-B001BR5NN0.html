The characters here might of been cliched, but guess what?, that's life. These kinds of characters are also real people. Real people who are in every high school across America. If you don't think so, you need to look harder. They may not always act or look the same as others, but they are there. A bunch of high schoolers have to serve detention together on a Saturday. Molly Ringwald is the Princess, Anthony Michael Hall is the geek, Emilio Estevez is the jock, Judd Nelson is the loner, and Ally Sheedy is the basket case. These different backgrounds and personalities come together and clash. They are pretty much forced to spend this time together and thoughts and feelings come out. Somebody dismisses it because it's a whinefest?. Get over it. This is life. It's one big whinefest!. The young actors(well, at the time)are all teriffic. They really bring these distinct individuals to life and make them believeable. I mean, really believeable. Paul Gleason is on hand as the principal who keeps an eye on the group. The ending might be a little too predictable and happy, but so what?. Judd Nelson gives the strongest performance here. He is really good. Hughes really writes teen life well. He does it a million times better than any writer writing the so called &quot;teen films&quot; of today. We need Mr. Hughes to come back and write teen movies like this for the new world we are living in. That's something to hope for. This is a very well made, very intelligent movie. Anybody who says these people are not real or are in schools, needs to open their eyes a bit more. A great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Adequate Adaptation of Novel"></head><body><p>Calling to mind that the novel "rhe Da Vinci Code" by the controversial Dan Btown primarily reads as a series of cerebral puzzles packaged as a suspense thriller pitting an ultra conservative branch of the Roman Catholic Church (Opus Dei) against a secret society protecting a 2000 year old secret surely explains why some critics claim that Ron Howard's 2006 film of the same name seems "weighed down in exposition and talkiness." (USA Today, May 19, 2006)<br /><br />Instead of remembering that the novel waxes "pedestrian" with Eureka moments by utilizing some fairly simplistic brainteasers which lead main characters Robert Langdon, an imminent Harvard symbolist,and Sophie Neveu, DCPJ cryptologist, down a labyrinthine rabbit hole where one amazing conclusion emerges, threatening to tumble the very pillars of Christian dogma decided upon in the year 325 at the council of Nicaea, reviewers penalize the movie for simply following the book's formula without the benefit of the shortened suspense apposite chapters.  Howard chooses for brevity's sake to forego many of the book's conundrums---the mystery of backwards DaVincian script which absorbs two or three pages is wisely condensed into one knowing statement of fact.  In a style typified in "A Beautiful Mind" to encapsulate the inner workings of genius schizophrenic John Nash, Howard binds Hans Zimmer music to CSI-demonstrative visual effects to cleverly illustrate each twist of the ultimate conspiracy for those of us not adept at piecing together clues involving art, religion, history, secret societies and arcane rituals.<br /><br />As with most films, Howard's "Da Vinci Code" performs to a mainstream audience and should succeed in entertaining accordingly.  A Tom Hanks with a poorly cut wannabe-professor's do plays the part of "Harrison Ford in Harris Tweed" with a likeable gravitas that includes ample sympathy and dawning understanding for his accidental sidekick, Amelie-waif Audrey Tautou whose chocolate brown eyes convey all the pathos expected from a by-product of the Greatest Story Ever Told.  Supporting cast members like Ian McKellan---admirably flipping from fanatical scholar to duplicitous tactician----Jean Reno----adding a manly French flavor packet to the book's otherwise stereotypical dogged flatfoot Bezu Fache-----and Paul Bettany-----almost unrecognizable as the overtly intense self-flagellating monk Silas after dryly sarcastic roles in "Wimbledon" and "A Beautiful Mind"-----capture the usual suspense genre second string to quirky perfection.<br /><br />All in all, the movie adequately represents Dan Brown's brainchild, offering to audiences two and a half hours of non-stop entertainment.  Bottom  line?  If the book titillated, so will the movie, in spite of the fact of an already revealed mystery and a reader's digest version of the sub-puzzles.  Visually agreeable, like most high budget films, the book and its characters come to as much of a celluloid life as is rendered possible given the original nature of the novel.  Are the prequel events of Langdon in "Angels and Demons" already in the works?<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

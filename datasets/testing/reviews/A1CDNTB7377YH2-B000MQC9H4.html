Jude Law and Cameron Diaz have an amazing chemistry while I didn't get the same feel between Kate Winslet and Jack Black (Black just doesn't seem to cut it as a love interest).<br /><br />Law lives with his two daughters and there are some very touching scenes with how they take to Diaz and invite her to be in their bedroom tent.</p></body></html>

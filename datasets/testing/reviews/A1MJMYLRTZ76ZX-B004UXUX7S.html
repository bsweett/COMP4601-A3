<meta name="summary" content="Something's rotten in paradise"></head><body><p>Please note that I saw this movie on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.<br /><br />I had high expectations for this movie, and having finally seen it myself, I have to say it's definitely a good movie, but it's not a great movie either. I did enjoy the film, and it's certainly another more than competent effort from director Alexander Payne ("Election," "About Schmidt," "Sideways") who hasn't disappointed yet. But I have to wonder at the movie's stellar reputation which doesn't seem to me to live up to all the hype. This is why I rate it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />All that having been said, I think the most interesting question here, given all the glowingly positive reviews and the very few negative ones, is why the movie seems to have struck such a responsive chord with the viewing public. And I think I have as good a theory as any about that. As hundreds of reviewers have already commented on the usual movie topics such as the acting, direction, script, plot, and so on, I'll mainly discuss this idea since I've read quite a few of the reviews here and I didn't see anyone else discuss this so far.<br /><br />The movie starts with  a voice-over of Clooney musing about "life in paradise" and wondering how people can think it's any different from anywhere else--people are the same, they have all the same problems--the only difference is that in Hawaii they have them in paradise. Clooney comments that people seem to think Hawaiians just sit on the beach or surf and drink mai tai's all day long, and that life is always idyllic.  "Are they insane?" Clooney asks. LOL<br /><br />And I think that right there sums up the appeal of this movie. The Germans have a word, "schadenfreude," which means "taking pleasure in the suffering of others." And I think the appeal of this movie has exactly to do with that. I suspect Americans in general envy those who get to live in Hawaii, and this story about a dysfunctional family and the tragic situation which the family has to deal with, all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, appealed to the public by showing that people in Hawaii can be just as miserable, and their lives can be just as screwed up, as everywhere else.<br /><br />In the case of Clooney's family, they might live in a natural paradise, but his family life is anything but. The kids are insolent and disobedient, use foul language inappropriate to children, court the wrong friends (mainly Alex, the teenage daughter, whose current flame is an oafish boor), and are in general constantly misbehaving and disrespectful of Clooney, the hapless father, who's just trying to get everyone through a very stressful and difficult time for the family.<br /><br />Yup, it's not exactly paradise; in fact, if you take away the location, it's more like hell: Clooney is miserable, the kids are miserable, the relatives are just lazing about hoping to cash in on Clooney's land deal, (spoiler alert!) his wife is dying, and on top of all this, Clooney finds out that his wife was cheating on him before she had her fatal boating accident. Oh, and did I mention the father-in-law has no respect for Clooney either? This is despite the fact that Clooney has a busy career as a lawyer, although he could easily retire if he just sold the huge 25,000 acre parcel of land that the family inherited from the Hawaiian royal family several generations earlier.<br /><br />Well, wives cheat on husbands, husbands cheat on wives, kids are ungrateful and spoiled, and the relatives are often less than stellar representatives of humanity pretty much everywhere. The only difference here is that it's in "paradise." In other words, life is pretty unhappy, depressing, and miserable in paradise too--and I think that in a nutshell summarizes the great appeal of this movie--and all the glowingly positive reviews.</p></body></html>

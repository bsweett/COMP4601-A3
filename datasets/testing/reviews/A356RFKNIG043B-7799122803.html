I had such great hopes at the start and soon gave them up when I saw how badly the script had messed with Carroll's original vision. That story and its magic wordplay is what made AIW great, not just the characters.<br /><br />Making this Alice's second visit down the hole is pointless and ends up killing the momentum. Carter steals the show and is the film's highlight, Depp is merely there as the Hatter, and Mia is, sorry to say, a very unexciting Alice. Is that really the best casting they could do? She just isn't much fun to watch here; we need an Alice of great verve and zing! Carroll's Alice is much sassier and just a lot more interesting, all told.<br /><br />But it's hard not to like the wonderful colors and fine sets, though the CGI gets old after about an hour. Nonetheless, the many fine visions make up for some of the meandering plot, if not nearly enough.<br /><br />Dang it, Tim: why mess with perfection? You could have stuck to the first and best story and made a real classic, but instead you used an unappealing older girl who leaches the fun out of everything, and a story that can't begin to compare with the faultless whimsy of the original.<br /><br />Sigh. Better luck next remake.</p></body></html>

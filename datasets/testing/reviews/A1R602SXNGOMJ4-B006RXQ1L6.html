In awe of seductive club singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Roxie meets Fred Cassely a man who convinces her he can 'make her showbiz career take off'. However after Roxie has undergone the 'casting couch' treatment, and Fred has had his  way with her, he reveals that he has no connections in showbusiness.  She shoots Fred Cassely and kills him.  Upon discovering that he had an affair, Roxie's husband Amos refuses to take the blame for the murder and Roxie is sent to jail.  In jail she finally meets Velma Kelly, currently receiving huge media attention for the double murder she committed earlier in the tale.  The prison Warden Mrs Morton (Queen Latifah) offers Roxie the opportunity of representation by slick Chicago lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). Billy is more a showbiz P.R agent than a legal lawyer and manipulates the tabloids into thinking Roxie is no more than an innocent 'good time girl' who took the wrong path, than a scheming murderess. The tabloids go crazy for the new girl on the cell block and Roxie finally becomes a star.<br />The storyline in this movie was ok but the singing and dancing was amazing!  Catherine Zeta Jones' opening number was the best I've seen.  The choreography in this movie will blow you away.</p></body></html>

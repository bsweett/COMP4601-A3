<meta name="summary" content="One podcast critic expressed a view that this film is "a mile wide and an inch deep"."></head><body><p>This is a serious ambitious movie about relationships--husbands and wives, parents and children, peers-- and it deserves credit for the attempt. It also has pathos and wit. Its themes is seemingly unconditional forgiveness and tolerance but that seems at times unreal and sentimental. The extended deathbed scenes also get too close to schmalz at times. There is also the irrelevant Sierra club type of stupid decision NOT to develop a choice piece of real estate.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A nice try, but never elevates itself to "classic""></head><body><p>To say this is a Bruce Campbell movie will suffice as a review for the "chinned one's" fans.  To clarify further - Bruce stars as a rest home-bound "Elvis Presley" in a battle against a 4000 year old mummy.  Whether Elvis is really Elvis (the victim of an identity switcharoo with an Elvis impersonator) or a senile old Elvis impersonator who took his gig too far, is left for the audience to decide.  Joining Elvis in his battle is "JFK" - another rest home resident.  When it's pointed out to Jack that he is black, he doesn't miss a beat: "They dyed me this colour!  J. Edgar Hoover and his boys!"<br /><br />If this sounds absurd, well, it is!  But it's cheerfully absurd.  Elvis is a convalescent who regains his interest in life when he notices the mystery of the mummy (from the Ho-Tep dynasty).  Campbell delivers cheesy lines as only he can (in a passable Elvis accent).  The key to the film is that everyone plays their parts absolutely straight, including the director.  This may be a bit off-putting to those unfamiliar with Campbell's work.  I think, though, if you go into the movie with no preconceived notions (because the film defies genres), you will quickly catch on and enjoy yourself for 90 minutes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it never quite elevates itself to a true classic in the horror-slash-something-else style.  Evil Dead 2 is gruesomely funny because it goes all the way - it's pure horror with an overarching absurd sense of humour.  The same cannot be said of Bubba Ho-Tep, which suffers too many fits and starts at the beginning.  Is it drama-comedy?  Horror-comedy?  Satire?  Horror with low bathroom comedy (Elvis has a growth on his nether region that gets a lot of discussion early on)? In the first 30 minutes, it is all these things, and therefore none of them.<br /><br />These traits would be forgivable if the movie would just go all the way.  Campbell's portrayal of Elvis, as well as some of the supporting players, finds the correct tone.  Unfortunately, the JFK character does not.  If you are going to have someone think they're JFK, go all the way!  Have him talk about Jacki and Bobby. Shouldn't he be resentful that Jacki married a Greek billionaire?  Shouldn't he lament the state of his family - playboys with no interest in politics getting arrested for stupid pranks?  Another near-fatal flaw is the lack of any singing by Elvis.  A movie on this budget could not afford Elvis songs.  Fair enough, but the Sledgehammer (TV) show "All Shook Up" by-passed this by using non-proprietary Elvis songs, like his gospel stuff.  I put this to the viewer: wouldn't the movie have had an added dimension of surreality if Elvis had been singing gospel or Christmas songs?<br /><br />These flaws are not fatal, but detract from the overall enjoyment of the film and lower my ranking to 3/5 stars.  The DVD itself is about what you'd expect for an independent film.  There are a number of deleted scenes and some making-of features that are interesting and worth the watch.</p></body></html>

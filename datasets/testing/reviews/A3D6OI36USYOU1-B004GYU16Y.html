<meta name="summary" content="Hey, this is Brad. Stop staring at my WIFE!!!"></head><body><p>OK, lets get this over with right now. Angelina Jolie is not one of my faves, but she has matured<br />and become 3 times more beautiful than she was 10 years ago. Its difficult to keep your eyes off<br />of her, she's mesmerizing.<br /><br />Now, this movie..... Oh man, where did they come up with this thing? Hard to write a review without<br />giving away the storyline but if you like spy thrillers, assassination plots, classic Russian intrigue<br />from the Cold War, threats of nucular (credit George Bush for that one) annihilation, and the movie<br />Soldier, you will no doubt love this thing.<br /><br />Jolie plays a CIA agent with bad taste in men, who works for Liev Shrieber who I hate. He is patently<br />smug throughout this thing, while Angelina goes about kicking the crap out of the whole city of NY. And<br />yes, the CIA does have offices in NY City, otherwise this story doesn't work if it takes place at Langley.<br />Oh wait, did I say this thing worked? Sorry about that. It doesn't work, its a mess, but its a fun mess<br />and a good diversion for 2 hours. The script is riddled with plotholes but most people wont care because<br />the action is so frantic, and Jolie is actually almost semi-believable. I wouldn't mess with her, and I<br />have a long history of messing with women who could kick my butt knowhudahmsayin?<br /><br />This flick didn't ping any latent Cold War tensions in my subconscious, but it was fun and that's what I<br />wanted out of it. 3 Spiders</p></body></html>

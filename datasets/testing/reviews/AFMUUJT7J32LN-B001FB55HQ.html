The robots are way too stupid. The people are pretty stupid too.  Thats the main problem. If the director understood warfare tactics only alittle it would move made the movie the best yet.IT would be have more suspense and really more interesting. Id of liked all the people to hide and dart around. That is a major let down.<br /><br />This is suppose to be the future. The people and machines have been battling for awhile now. They should be expert in killing in each other. I would of liked the people to know where to shoot and robots not to miss. It would of been good if they had some kind of technology to trick the robots. An example, Have the people have remote control toys that drive out and fly around. The terminators can not track more then 10 objects at a time. Something clever. IT would of been so much better. It would of gave a glimpse of the future. The humans and machines merging into one.<br /><br />Its kind of stupid that the robots shoot and miss and the people are better shots. The people stupidly run away and get killed.  At this time it would just not be possible to be that stupid.<br /><br /> I can understand the use of firepower to suppress an and stop the enemy. The blind shooting and unlimited firepower of terminators is stupidity. The flying robots could afford to use alot of rounds but the humanoid terminators need to be smarter in using firepower.<br /><br />Then the stupid moments of love and girls are in love and stuff like that. That was pretty disappointing. Id liked some fun and smart alec language. This movie could of had some memorable moments. IT had plenty of opportunity for great banter.<br /><br />Seeing the movie once is enough. Polish up the movie like I say and people will say its the best yet. PLEASE LISTEN IF YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR.<br /><br />The first terminator movie is the best of the series. T2 is ok. T3 is going downhill.Terminator salvation is an improvement but does not meet the high standard of Terminator original.</p></body></html>

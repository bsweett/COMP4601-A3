"Unforgiven" is a tale straight from the borderlands between good and evil.  The plot is interesting but in no way explains the film's allure.  The acting is superb and this is particularly true in regards to Gene Hackman and Richard Harris. English Bob is not on the screen long but Harris puts in a tremendous, and very memorable, performance.  Hackman's Little Bill is haunting and you'd honestly have to say that Eastwood is nearly as good as his depiction of William Munney is subtle and flawless.  The ending blazes and Clint gets in a few top notch oneliners like, "Anyone who doesn't want to die can go out the back."  Ah, this film has been great every time I've seen it.<br /><br />Was this one the last of the great westerns?  Yes "Unforgiven" certainly is wonderful, but hopefully it won't be one of the last of its kind.  There's still energy in this genre and I'm hoping that more movies like it are made in the future.</p></body></html>

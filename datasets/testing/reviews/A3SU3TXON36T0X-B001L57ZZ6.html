This film features a super-computer capable of controlling the lives and actions of all the citizens of the United States.  Certain citizens are singled out by the computer for no apparent reason and drafted into the secret war being waged against the United States president for his violation of the Constitution.  What is most eerie about this film, is the way it shows that technology has overtaken society and all actions and thoughts are capable of being monitored.  In the film, both stars are singled out by the computer for various reasons and made to take part in the planned action against the president.  Since technological devices (including cell phones, blackberries, computers, street signs, and overhead projectors) are ubiquitous in any given city it is possible for the computer to access the location of the citizens anywhere and also impossible for them to escape its grip.  Thus, we learn how freedom is imperiled by emerging technologies which already are amongst us capable of controlling our very actions.  As it turns out, the entire computer system has been implemented in an effort to fight terrorism.  However, the costs prove to be enormous as it becomes apparent that in fighting terrorism all freedom has been lost.  This film is certainly quite eerie when one considers the ubiquitous presence of spy technology in our society and the fact that every action is being recorded.</p></body></html>

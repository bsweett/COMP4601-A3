This theme from THE RING is given a new life in DARK WATER.  While the movie is certainly spooky at times, I felt like I was watching THE RING all over again.  It's not hard to predict where the story is going, and this lack of suspense makes the movie seem a little lengthy and protracted.  Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly gives a top notch performance as Dahlia, a young single mother who moves with her daughter into a low-rent apartment on Roosevelt Island.  Facing nasty custody charges from her ex-husband, Connelly takes the apartment to start her life anew.  But things go awry when the apartment starts sprouting leaks all over the place.  Water is everywhere in this movie, from the relentless rain outside to the faucets, commodes, sinks, washers, etc.  The psychological occurrences are deeply rooted in Connelly's own past, and as the movie unfolds, we know there is something definitely going on in the dwelling.<br /><br />All this is effectively chilling, but since its predictable, one doesn't get totally involved.<br /><br />Ariel Gade is marvelous as young Cecily; Tim Roth, Dougray Scott, and Pete Postelthwaite are equally effective.  Only John C. Reilly in a basically utilitarian role is wasted as the apartment's manager.  The musical score by Angelo Badalmenti (the man who did the wonderful TWIN PEAKS music) is quite good.  If you haven't seen THE RING, you may enjoy DARK WATER; however, isn't it time to leave the possessive child demon behind?</p></body></html>

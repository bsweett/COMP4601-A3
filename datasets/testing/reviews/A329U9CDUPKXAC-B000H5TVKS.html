<meta name="summary" content="Really good"></head><body><p>I actually enjoyed it more than the first one. I knew there would be a twist ending so I was looking for that right away. And I was still surprised at the end. Add that to some really gruesome scenes and you got yourself a good horror movie. I'm not saying it's the best horror ever, but I still give it a 4 out of 5.</p></body></html>

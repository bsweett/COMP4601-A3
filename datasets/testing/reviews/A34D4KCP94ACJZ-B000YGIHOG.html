<meta name="summary" content="Not Quite as Refreshing as the Original, but Still Very Good"></head><body><p>28 Weeks Later is a sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, which was a refreshing zombie film that took itself very seriously and arguably reinvigorated the sub-genre for bloodthirsty audiences around the world...I consider myself among them.  Danny Boyle steps back as director but his influence is intact as he produces this film.  Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, a Spanish filmmaker recently nominated for an Academy Award for his short film Esposados (released in the US as Linked), directs this sequel but maintains many of the stylistic standards of the first film.  Like 28 Days Later the cinematography is digital, and it is in 35mm format with some shaky camera work and some very quick edits.  I have to admit that at times the attack scenes seemed a little over-stylized and one scene was derivative enough from the Blair Witch Project that it came off as an intentional tribute.  Not to say that bothers me much, I'm just pointing it out.<br /><br />The first film was about a virus called "Rage" that quickly turns it's victims into fast-moving cannibals that are a bit more real and scary than the mindless traditional zombies of George Romero's films.  After a while the first film ended with all the infected people starving to death. The second film starts off with a thorough American occupation of London that works to contain and prevent another outbreak while at the same time re-introducing British civilians.  We are then introduced to a family of characters, some of which have a genetic abnormality that allows them to remain healthy with the virus.  They are un-effected carriers of "Rage".  This of course leads to another outbreak in the setting of a military occupied London.  And so we sit back and watch as the zombified shenanigans ensue.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is extremely violent but it's even more brutal than many films of this sub-genre because it takes itself so seriously and it actually works effectively for that.  We are introduced to several would-be protagonists, two of which are deeply riddled with guilt and that makes the characters three-dimensional which allows us to actually care about them.  But by the same token, the movie doesn't pull punches and the zombies get their way more often than not.  That means the violent tone in general was a bit more real for me.  There is also an incredibly gory sequence that is identical to a scene in Planet Terror, the first feature in the recent collaboration Grindhouse.  It's interesting to compare the two scenes, because in Planet Terror the scene is so amusing and slapsticky while essentially the same scene here in 28 Weeks Later comes off as shocking and disgusting. It is an interesting comparison that compliments the refined style of both movies.<br /><br />The middle acts of 28 Weeks Later serve as a political allegory of sorts, in terms of the war in Iraq, although I couldn't perceive which side the film is actually taking.  It seemed to suggest both judgements of ineptitude and sympathy toward the American military.  So the commentary seemed kind of inconsequential other than to reflect our modern cultural and political climate, which is firmly in the tradition of George Romero's early zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead.  I must say that the commentary itself was so heavy-handed at times that I was really keeping my fingers crossed for that fast-moving Saddam Hussein zombie...oh well, perhaps I'll have to wait for 28 months.</p></body></html>

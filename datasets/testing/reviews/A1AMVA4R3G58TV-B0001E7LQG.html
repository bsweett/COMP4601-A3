I laughed through out the entire movie.<br />Its wonderful to see a fun, romantic comedy where the actors are mature adults. No kid stuff here, this is a comedy anyone over 35 can relate to and appreciate. My favorite scene is Diane's crying scene - which is still hysterically funny. A great fun movie.</p></body></html>

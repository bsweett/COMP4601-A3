<meta name="summary" content="Pixar Finally Getting Realistic but No Advances in Animation"></head><body><p>Don't get me wrong, the animation is great, but it's no better than Finding Nemo or Shrek. But what makes this animated feature stand out above others is that the storyline has finally got...uh...humanized. No talking animals, no life-like inanimate objects, just ordinary family problems as seen through the eyes of a family that's anything but ordinary.<br /><br />They're (should I say it?) Incredible.<br /><br />Gone are the talking fish and donkey, replaced by superhumans with superproblems; after devastating litigious events strike the superheroes, they go into hiding with the aid of our government. But some of them just can't let go. Enter Mr. Incredible and his family (Elastigirl, his wife, and their special children). Mr Incredible listens to the police scanner, hoping that something bad will happen nearby, thus allowing him to sneak in and thwart a robbery or save victims from a burning building.<br /><br />Life, as an ordinary human, is killing Mr. Incredible slowly. So when an offer comes in to eliminate a menacing robot on a distant island, Mr. Incredible sneaks off to do the good deed. But it's a trap, and now his family (who've been in hiding all this time, trying to be the typical nuclear family) must "dash" to his rescue. The dysfunction is palpable as the brother and sister constantly quibble, Mother has to keep them separate and keep their powers under control, and Dad (Mr. Incredible) has to try and save his family from a dastardly villain.<br /><br />This was a truly enjoyable story for an animated film; it has characters approaching depression, while others worry about marital infidelity. Quite unusual for a high-tech "cartoon".</p></body></html>

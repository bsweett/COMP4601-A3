<meta name="summary" content="This movie is beyond wonderful..."></head><body><p>`It's a Wonderful Life' is one of those movies that could easily have fallen victim to its own popularity.  Rendered as one of the greatest American films, `It's a Wonderful Life' has a lot to live up to, and with all that hype comes, at times, major disappointment.  The nice thing about `It's a Wonderful Life' is that it actually lives up to the hype, and then some.  Not only is it one of the most heartwarming films I've ever had the privilege of seeing (sure, it may not seem it at times, but just wait) but it is also one of the smartest and most intelligent films to come along.<br /><br />The film tells the story of George Bailey, your typical `nice' guy with big dreams that finds himself shortchanged by everyday happenstance until he's married with children, still living in the same small town he wanted so badly to escape from and working a job he never anticipated or desired.  It's not that George is unhappy it's just that he is less than satisfied.  As events unfold within his life that press firmly upon him to where he starts to feel trapped George contemplates the unfathomable.<br /><br />Suicide.<br /><br />The film somewhat starts at this point; with an angel being sent down to save George from himself in an attempt to gain his wings.  What follows is a beautiful look at a life lived to the full despite not being lived as fully as one would have hoped, and then we get a glimpse at what life would have been like had George never lived at all, and while the results are a tad on the extreme side they help us to appreciate that each and everyone of us play a large part in the lives of everyone we touch.  It's a beautiful and sincere message that resonates with everyone and touches every soul.<br /><br />If you walk away from `It's a Wonderful Life' unmoved then you must have ice in your veins.<br /><br />Some pass this movie over expecting it to be nothing more than a Christmas film, but Christmas is the smallest part of this film.  Yes, it is used around the holidays to fill the heart with gladness and express the wonderment of children and family and friends and blessings but those emotions and that message is much farther reaching than a single yearly event.<br /><br />The film is bolstered along by some beautiful performances, especially from James Stewart (who has never been one of my favorite actors).  He delivers such a powerfully moving and real portrayal of a man who doesn't fully understand all that he has until he is faced with the prospect of never having it at all.  His transformation from a man down and out and unsatisfied to a man striving to retain all that he fears he has lost is amazing and utterly convincing.  This is the type of performance that moves people to tears.  I was also impressed with Lionel Barrymore who portrays Henry F. Potter (the Scrooge in this tale) with such devilish intrigue.  He is the perfect villain to Stewart's worn soul.  This is the type of villain you love to hate.<br /><br />In the end I must urge everyone to watch this movie, not once, not twice but over and over again.  Don't limit yourself to that one time of year to enjoy this wonderful movie but indulge yourself with one of the most beautifully complete tales of love, life and the American dream ever made.</p></body></html>

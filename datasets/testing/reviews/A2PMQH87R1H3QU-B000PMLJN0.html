<meta name="summary" content="LOVED THE STAGE AND MAKE UP, JUST THE SCRIP IS LAME!!"></head><body><p>I just rented this flick and watch it, only wants to see this flick, because of saw director, and was a ghost story.<br />I really liked the makeup, special effects, stage looks and the way they made it and cast. Real eye catching colors and style & old fashion 70 & 80s ghost story looks, such as I loved.<br />But the scrip is the stinker, almost the end, that cop never comes down with backup..Never see the police dept..And the main actor goes almost places and spooky places for long while nothing happened to him after a lots incidents!.  Just alots of  flaws here and there, make the flick some type of a joke & unbelievable..Kind of cheesy, love the cast and the old woman and dolls real good deal, just scrip was lame and screw up the whole flick & lost interest ! Anyway  guess just a rental worth nothing more. C+</p></body></html>

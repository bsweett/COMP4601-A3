<meta name="summary" content="If only the rest of the movie were as good as Joan Allen."></head><body><p>THE UPSIDE OF ANGER features this great, tour-de-force, hilarious performance from Joan Allen as a woman who becomes a pissed-off bitch when her husband disappears on her. She owns the movie completely, and, though she's often better than the film itself, it still manages to give her entertaining things to say and do.<br /><br />She spends the first half of the movie drunk out of her mind, saying the most preposterous, awful things. The teens behind us in the screening kept laughing their asses off, for Allen really was that funny.<br /><br />She maintains strong chemistry with Kevin Costner, who gives one of the best performances I've seen from him in years, and he gets some really funny moments. But the movie belongs completely to Allen. She's hilarious.<br /><br />Her best scene, maybe, involves her meeting with her eldest daughter's future in-laws, after being blindsided with the news of the engagement. As her character's composure completely deteriorates, Allen garners some big laughs, even though you also feel embarrassed for everyone in the scene with her.<br /><br />At another point, her character has become so well-established that she's able to generate laughs from a dismissive facial expression.<br /><br />The movie itself is weak. The direction from Mike Binder, who costars, isn't great. The screenplay has some great moments but too many weak ones. The daughters, played by Alicia Witt, Evan Rachel Wood, Erika Christiansen and Keri Russell, barely escape becoming cariacatures and spend the majority of the time reacting to Allen. Sometimes the movie drags, and the ending, once it gets there, feels like a cheat.<br /><br />It's another sad case of a great performance in a humdrum movie.</p></body></html>

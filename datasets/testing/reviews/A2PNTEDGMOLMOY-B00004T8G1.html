While nowhere near as terrifying or as polished as the first Michael Meyers tale, "The Fog" offers up several treats for horror fans in addition to some genuine scares.<br /><br />There may not be a better opening to a horror film.  A bunch of kiddies sit by a campfire late at night on the beach as old, grizzled John Houseman spins a yarn about the ghosts of a lost ship that foundered off this very same coastline exactly 100 years ago.  Not one of those kids slept a wink after that tale, rest assured.<br /><br />It appears that this old tale is true . . . 100 years ago, a wealthy local man sought to found a leper colony nearby (he had caught the disease as well), and this didn't appeal to the local villagers.  So six of them used a campfire to lure the shipful of lepers onto the rocks at night, causing the shipwreck and the loss of all hands.  Being civic-minded scoundrels, the six murderers then stole the wealthy leper's gold and founded the town of Antonio Bay, which now celebrates its centennial.<br /><br />Carpenter and his "Halloween" collaborator Debra Hill build on this excellent story foundation by assembling one heck of a cast.  Jamie Lee Curtis (given the immortal line, "Bad things seem to happen near me"), Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all feature in "The Fog," as does the aforementioned Mr. Houseman and also Hal Holbrook as a tormented pastor.<br /><br />Carpenter and Hill also create a great look for "The Fog."  Shot in 1980, the special effects are low-tech, but that is part of the appeal.  Unable to capitalize on today's CGI effects, Carpenter's team used wit and talent to create some terror out of primitive special effects, a fog machine, and some lamps.  Believe me, it works.<br /><br />The story's execution is a bit weak.  While there are many intriguing setups (Ms. Barbeau's radio station is perfectly situated on a precarious cliff overlooking the ocean, where she can watch the fog roll into town while screaming warnings over the radio and also placing her in dire peril), there is a lot of silliness, too.  Jamie Lee Curtis gets picked up as a hitchhiker by a local, and before you know it we see them in bed post-coitus . . . and *then* they introduce themselves.  Ms. Barbeau also makes some rather quick leaps to the correct deduction that the fog is lethal.  And a dead seaman lurches to his feet to attack an unsuspecting victim in a hospital . . . but somehow misses and falls inert to the floor, and nobody says anything other than "you okay"?  Hmmm.<br /><br />There's also a bit of concern over the tale of vengeance.  The story veers from the fog (and its ghosts) taking out anyone who comes into contact with it to a tale of exacting specific revenge against the descendants of the six murderers who lured the leper ship to its doom.  The story has trouble deciding.  (Although it's nice to see that the fog has remained current on technical matters, being able to take out phone lines and power generators -- it's silly, but does help create the proper tension.)<br /><br />"The Fog" is easy to dismiss after 25 years with its low-tech special effects, its story holes, and the incredibly weak music selection of the local deejays.  But it gets certain things exactly right -- the creepy look of fog sweeping in off the ocean, the terror of opening the door and looking out into the murk, and the haunting soundtrack of Mr. Carpenter.  (Perhaps its not as famous as the "Halloween" score, but it should be.)<br /><br />Maybe people in sunny, arid climates can laugh off "The Fog" as a silly, unworthy follow-up to "Halloween."  Maybe.  But in Portland, Oregon, we get our fair share of foggy nights, and I can guarantee that the next time I'm out in the fog, I'm going to be looking over my shoulder.  That's a calling card of a good horror flick!</p></body></html>

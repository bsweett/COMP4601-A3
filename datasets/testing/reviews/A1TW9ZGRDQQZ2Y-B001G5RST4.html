<meta name="summary" content="Kinda Funny, Kinda Cute, Kinda Boring"></head><body><p>I saw this movie with my young cousins (ages 7 & 11) and they both said it was okay, but while better than Shark Tale, it doesn't compare to the Pixar films. There are some funny moments (loved those military Penguins & the lemur king), but I found myself dozing off a couple of times. This is a pretty good one for the kids and would make a good rental instead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is it okay to be adorable and macabre at the same time?"></head><body><p>It's pretty sad that it has taken me so many years to finally get my hands on a copy of the DVD.  When this first came out, I went with my mom to the theatre and was instantly captivated by the enchanting morbidity of this film.  Oh, I had the video for years, but it's just so hard to use video now.<br /><br />Anyway, I am in love with this movie and its odd inability to be placed in any one genre.  I would almost call this a fairy tale, except the only unreality is hellfire and withcraft.  But even with all the death and blood and murder there is something positively sweet and even cute about this storyline that is admittedly a far cry from Washington Irving's tale of a funny Halloween prank.<br /><br />In this tale, the Headless Horseman is no story and prank but a real ghost terrorizing the citizens of a little New England village.  Ichabod Crane, still hilariously done by Johnny Depp, is a neurotic cop from New York City sent to investigate the murders.  Unfortunately, he is a realist who has no patience for magic and ghosts.<br /><br />The story is a tight, fun, and thoroughtly satisfying one that is endearing in all its bloodshed with its likeable characters that seem to have jumped right out of a storybook, albeit one that spends the entire plot in overcast gloom.  Even the blood, which defies all knowledge of clotting and reality, is fun in its macabre way.<br /><br />This is honestly one of my sentimental favorites, a deranged fairy tale brought to life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a nice romantic movie."></head><body><p>Hitch(Will Smith) helps guys that have trouble with women, He helps them get their footing, and ask out the women by helping them do what they like. He also does this because he was rejected by a woman in college, and doesn't want to see that happen to them. He helps out a poor slob win over a rich heiress, and in the process, falls in love with a tabloid reporter. Then it all comes down on him, the tabolid reporter that he thought loved him sells him out and thinks that he is simply a "date hunter", that he hunts women for men to date.<br /><br />Will Smith was good in this, He was right for the part, and He had the feel for the character. I liked the way Eva Medes took her character and interacted with Will Smith. Kevin James makes a impressive first outing with movies, he is the most funny in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is. somehow, I felt the script was weak, I felt that some moments were forced, and some of the Humor was so fast that you didn't have time to think about the joke. I also felt that Will Smith was a little too confident in his role, and that he felt that he WAS the character, when I think that he could've taken situations and used his humor to make it funnier.<br /><br />The movie wasn't a masterpiece, I felt it was WAY better than some movies that have been released that call themselves "Romantic Comedies". I also felt that the Director was doing a good job but.... He could've gotten better performances by everybody. The writers needed to write something original, and instead of the cliches', they could've actually formed a decent romantic movie. I am not saying I didn't like it, I felt it was a very good movie but it has its flaws.</p></body></html>

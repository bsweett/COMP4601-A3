<meta name="summary" content="Imelda Staunton and David Yates make "Potter" all the better!"></head><body><p>This is going to be short and sweet.<br /><br />I am not a Harry Potter fan...not of the books nor the movies (though I have read them and KEEP watching them!I guess I am just caught in the mania!)).  This film works best for me. Why?<br /><br />(1).Imelda Staunton. Ever since first seeing her in PETER'S FRIENDS years ago and since in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY , VERA DRAKE and countless Brit-flicks, I have admired what this incredible actress does on screen.She IS Dolores Umbridge, the ice-cold emmisary from the Ministry of Magic, and Staunton embodies everything that is so wonderfully,gleefully and deliciously awful about her character.This is Oscar material here!<br /><br />(2).Finally, these films are maturing along with Harry and friends and I am loving it.This installment was darker than the rest and I found it the most to my liking. I like director David Yates' style way more than Christopher Columbus'.This film was urgently paced and more thrilling than the previous movies.Lots of non essential material is cut from the book in order to make a better screenplay.'Nuff said!</p></body></html>

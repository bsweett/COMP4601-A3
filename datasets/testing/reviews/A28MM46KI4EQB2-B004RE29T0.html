<meta name="summary" content="Classic Stuff!"></head><body><p>A long with the likes of such movies as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29PO">Aliens [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L16FAE">Predator (Ultimate Hunter Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], and various others...this is one of the best sci-fi action movies ever in my opinion.  Even before Aliens, which is probably the best of the movies in the Alien series of course, this movie came first and was simply a groundbreaking sci-fi movie.  The 3rd and 4th Alien movies were okay, but this and the 2nd movie have stood the test of time and are just awesome...both are movies that I upgrade everytime they come out on a new format, and I am stoked to now have them on Blu-Ray!  Most excellent when paired together in a mini marathon as well!  >:-)</p></body></html>

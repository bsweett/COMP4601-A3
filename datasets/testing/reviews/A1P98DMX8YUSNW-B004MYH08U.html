Well, okay, the scene where the Green Hornet's 1970s Chrysler plows into the newsroom of Seth Rogan's character's newspaper is funny, with all the tschoktkees on the reporters' desks just like in real life, is funny. Otherwise, I was a little bored, despite attempts to rev this up with a rock soundtrack mixed REALLY loud. There's a lot of chasing and fighting. Too much, to the point where it becomes numbing, really. As these superhero movies go, this is just okay.</p></body></html>

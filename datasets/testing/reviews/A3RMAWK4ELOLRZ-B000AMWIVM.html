<meta name="summary" content="He makes them kill themselves at their own game"></head><body><p>These two guys wake up chained up on opposite ends of a dirty utility room.  Whoever chained them up was brilliant, because the hand saw they are given doesn't cut through metal, but goes through flesh and bone.  They wonder why they're there.  One is calmer than the other.  In the room with them, there's a dead body, and in each of the hands there is a tape player and a handgun.  The two guys each have a tape with instructions on what to do in order to stay alive.  The madman behind all this is nicknamed Jigsaw, and he put his victims in these situations so to show them how precious life is.  In his eyes, people are killing themselves with drugs and whatnot that they don't take time to appreciate their own lives and what they got.  As the movie goes on, we, the audience find out information on the two guys.  One of the guys is a doctor and doesn't spend enough time at home with his wife and daughter.  The other is a photographer who, throughout the movie, we find out that he's been secretly taking pictures of the doctor.<br /><br />This movie isn't as scary as I thought it would have been, but it is pretty disturbing and intense.  I'm pretty good at watching blood, but when the part where he had to saw his own leg off to free himself from the chain, I had to cover my eyes.  This movie made me think a lot.  Life is too short, and this movie will tell you to savor each breath you take.</p></body></html>

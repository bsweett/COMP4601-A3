<meta name="summary" content=""W" Stands For "Why?""></head><body><p>Watching this jumbled, poorly motivated movie, baffling where it tries to be funny and hilarious where it tries to be straightforward, I have to ask: why?  Why did a director of Oliver Stone's standing feel the need to make this mess?  Why now?  And why did any studio think it would be a good idea to release a movie about a sitting president who isn't up for re-election?  I have no answers.  And I'm out more than two hours of my life.<br /><br />This movie isn't bad.  I almost wish it was, because I could say something funny and demeaning about it.  But it doesn't have the courage to pull out all stops and really, really suck.  It reminds me of a Saturday Night Live version of the Bush administration, with people whose resemblance to the actual figures is close but rings hollow.  And, like nearly all feature-length SNL films, this feels like it would have been funny at six minutes, but is interminable as it is.<br /><br />The most surprising trait of the movie is how sympathetic Stone is to President Bush.  The jumpy cutting of the movie trailer makes it look like this will be a farcical mockery of the current administration, but Bush actually comes out looking like an honest guy who really can't figure out how things spiraled so far out of his hands.  Bush here becomes an upright guy with perhaps an excess of credulity, surrounded by a small army of leeches sucking off his good character.  Stone blatantly dislikes Bush's cabinet, but seems remarkably fond of the man himself.<br /><br />But the movie ends with the ball still up in the air, quite literally.  The story ends in late 2003.  I can't help but wonder if this movie began life as a script for a TV film that was supposed to run before the 2004 election, and Stone hijacked it.  At this date, running the Bush story without any mention of his re-election campaign or his second term seems frivolous.  And why now, anyway?  We don't have the historical perspective Stone had for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QEXYS">Nixon</a>, and it can't influence anybody's election bid, so why waste our time and ticket money just now?<br /><br />The resemblance of many actors to their characters can charitably be called approximate.  Elizabeth Banks' resemblance to Laura Bush is downright remarkable for its accuracy, and Bruce McGill's George Tenet is nearly spot-on.  But Richard Dreyfuss seems to think that face prosthetics and a snarl is all it takes to capture Dick Cheney.  Scott Glenn's Donald Rumsfeld is so far afield that I didn't know who he was supposed to be until someone told me.  James Cromwell looks not one bit like Poppy Bush.  And Thandie Newton doesn't so much look like Condi Rice as a Rice impersonator in a low-budget zombie film.<br /><br />That's to say nothing of Josh Brolin as Bush.  His accent is so broad, and his repetition of Bush's keystone gestures so redundant, that he seems to go out of his way to remind us that he's an actor playing Bush.  Though most of this film centers on Bush's presidency, flashbacks in his life go back as far as 1966, and watching the forty-year-old Brolin portraying a teenaged fraternity pledge is a marked strain on credibility the movie never entirely shakes.<br /><br />Speaking of shaking, this film is so full of jittery handheld camera work that I frequently had to shield my eyes to ward of motion sickness.  On the one hand, I understand why Stone wants to create the impression of cinema verite in this film.  On the other hand, the current movie fad for nausea-inducing cinematography can't end too soon for me.<br /><br />And why does this movie seem so thoroughly cribbed from Michael Moore's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SINT52">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>?  I mean, apart from the fact that it uses a lot of the same news footage, transplants a huge number of Bush quotes (often entirely changing the context), and has the same organizational structure like a filmed version of a five paragraph essay?  I already have that DVD, I didn't need to pay theater ticket prices to see it remade.<br /><br />In sum, this movie will disappoint Bush supporters, Bush detractors, film buffs, political devotees, and... well... everybody else too.  With a director like Oliver Stone and a cast of stars of this magnatude, we expect better than this.  Whether you agree with its basic thesis, disagree, or wait to be persuaded, you will walk out of "W" shaking your head and asking yourself, "Why?"</p></body></html>

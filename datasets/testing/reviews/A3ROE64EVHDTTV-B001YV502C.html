It's very intense and thought-provoking.<br />*Camera style, even though is free-handed, is still very smooth and slick (meaning that it doesn't shake around too much).<br />*Many action scenes use very long cuts, showing off the actors' and director's mastery in timing, acting, and details.  The logistics of these scenes are complex, so it is very impressive.<br />*The film's color greatly adds to the dismal atmosphere.<br />*Strong ethnic influences literally teleport the viewer into a unique setting.  To me, the British refugee camp resembles the streets of Iraq (thus making it relevant to today's current events).<br />*Some scenes stick out vividly in my head (in particular, the ending scene where everybody stops fighting and bows down to the newborn baby...).<br />*What few special effects the film has are very effective.  I couldn't even tell that it had any.<br />*The characters are fairly well developed.  Their deaths are quite tragic.<br />*Good sound and music design.<br />*Good production design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Some people may find the violence and brutality a bit much.  Overall, it is a bleak film.<br />*They never did explain how people became infertile (then again, I think it's a minor point).<br />*Didn't really want certain characters to die...<br />*Not sure how close it is to the original novel.<br /><br />This is one of the only few movies that makes me feel depressed (second only to "The Passion").  Aside from the intense brutal violence, the film serves as a shadowy mirror to modern-day society.  It effectively portrays rampant terrorism, human cruelty, and injustices of worldly powers.  The filming of it is excellent in its own right, with slick camera work and very complex action scenes.  But it is not like a typical sci-fi blockbuster; it's focus is more on artistery, thought-provoking ideas, and emotional impact.  I think it is very effective, and is a definate eye-opener into what the future could possibly be if things continue to go as they are.<br /><br />DVD includes some fascinating featurettes; one that analyzes modern-day society, and one that shows the making of the film.  And then there's the trailer.  Pretty good deal.</p></body></html>

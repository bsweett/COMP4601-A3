<meta name="summary" content="Pathetic, silly acting. Especially from the 'women warriors""></head><body><p>This is one of those movie series in which it becomes progressively worse with each installment. Not much I can say, but the women are atypical stereotypes of the aggressive females; long on angst and short on acting skills. Laughable plots and more laughable are the actors trying to reach out "acting". If you like sci-fi action flicks (there are boring sequences), this is pretty good. But don't ever expect Oscar performances in these movies. I guess no one really does.</p></body></html>

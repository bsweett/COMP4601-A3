<meta name="summary" content="Another Great/Fun Movie"></head><body><p>I think that I like this movie more than the original, but the original is still great. What is really good about this movie that makes it better than the first movie is the obvious return of characters we know from the video game series. It is great to see Carlos, Jill and the coolest of all, Nemesis in this movie.<br /><br />There are many times in this film that make references to the games. It was fun watching and saying, "Oh that was on Code Veronica!" for example. The acting was once again really good, but the action and special effects really make this a fun movie to watch. IF you love the first movie, then you should like this one. Especially if you know the series and know the game references that are made.</p></body></html>

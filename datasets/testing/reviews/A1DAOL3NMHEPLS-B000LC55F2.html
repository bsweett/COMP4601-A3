I saw this in the theatre on New Year's Eve, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, it's a bit long. And constant twists and turns in the story line may leave some viewers baffled or irritated. But I found it fascinating on every level, from its portrayal of century-ago theatre to the philosophical questions it raises at the end. One of the best movies of 2006.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHO BECOMES THE TERRORIST?"></head><body><p>Spielberg's MUNICH is a brilliantly made movie, with superb direction, cinematography, acting and music...but it is not a pleasant movie to watch.  Inspired in part by true events that occurred after the tragic terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich olympics, the movie offers the difficult question of just when does revenge become simply murder?  As in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg has some deeply disturbing and realistic scenes that are uncomfortable to watch in the sanctity of your home.  But the film is powerful indeed.  Eric Bana is marvelous in the role of Avner, giving us an honest portrait of a man who questions his ethics; Geoffrey Rush is great as his deceptive boss; and the underappreciated Ciaran Hinds glows in his role as the team's "worrier."  Surprisingly, future James Bond Daniel Craig's role is the least developed, but he does an okay job. John Williams does one of his best scores, and the movie is certainly a cinematic achievement, if not totally an entertaining one.</p></body></html>

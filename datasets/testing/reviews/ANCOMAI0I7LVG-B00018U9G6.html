<meta name="summary" content="Not the best comedy in the world, but decent enough to enjoy..."></head><body><p>There was a lot of hype surrounding `School of Rock' by the time I finally got around to watching it; hype that I'm not sure I really understand.  Sure, parts of this film are funny, but it's never so funny that I can't hold back the laughter.  In fact, for every critic and fan alike who scream this as being one of Black's greatest film roles (there was even talk back when this was released of his performance being `Oscar' worthy) I'm left a little confused because to me he's done much better than this.  Black does have his moments, but it's never enough to really convince me that he's award worthy.  To me it's nothing more than an amiably funny performance.<br /><br />The film follows Dewey Finn, played by Black, a down on his luck guitar player who never stopped following his dream even though it left him broke, friendless and pretty much considered a loser by his peers.  Being behind on his rent and jobless (recently being booted from his band) Dewey steals the identity of his roommate and takes on a sub-teaching job at a local elementary school.  Dewey of course has no idea what to do with these children, that is until he finds out that they are all insanely talented musicians.  Wanting to compete in `The Battle of the Bands' he decides to form a band within his classroom disguising the idea as a school project for next quarter that they are getting a leg up on.<br /><br />The plot of course follows the same formula of `dork uses people, everything goes great, dork is exposed, dork learns lesson, everything is great' that most comedies of this persuasion find themselves pigeonholed into, but it's still fun.  The musical numbers are by far the more entertaining scenes in the film, especially at the end when they perform at `The Battle of the Bands'.<br /><br />Some have mentioned that Black steals the show, but I strongly disagree.  To me it's Joan Cusack, the school principle, who steals every frame.  Cusack is probably my all time favorite supporting actress.  She makes even the unwatchable films worth the time.  Here, as the uptight principle she is just completely on mark the whole time.  She's quick witted, funny and intelligent, a brilliant actress.  Sarah Silverman also adds some character as the only real villain in the film, playing Dewey's roommates battleaxe of a girlfriend.  She's funny in that irritating yelling `want to sock her in the mouth' kind of way, which I didn't expect from her.<br /><br />All in all this is not a bad film, it is funny, but it lacks originality, and to me Black is just not that wonderful.  He serves his purpose (that of playing the dim witted idiot who learns a life lesson as well as teaches one) but any other comedian could have pulled this off, maybe even better.  Black is no Ferrell or Carrey, but he does succeed in making the general public laugh, most of the time, and here is one of his more polished roles (as in not much gross humor or unnecessary crudeness) so it should appeal to most in the family.  I may not completely agree with the praise heaped upon this film, but I can't argue with the fact that it did make me laugh and didn't leave me sour.</p></body></html>

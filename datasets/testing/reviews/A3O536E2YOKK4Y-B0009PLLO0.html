<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie if You're into Gay Romance"></head><body><p>Are you in the mood for a great historical adventure epic in the manner of "Braveheart" or "Gladiator"? Well, you're certainly not gonna get it with this godawful flick. "Alexander" is a 3-hour unfocused bore.<br /><br />Worst of all, the viewer has to endure the overlong running time witnessing Alexander (Colin Farrell) and his best friend, Hephaistion (Jared Leto), absurdly exchanging romantic looks at each other throughout the picture. Although they (thankfully) never do more than hug, the flick gives the vibe that it may turn into a gay porn film at any moment.<br /><br />Is this the mighty, world-conquering Alexander the Great -- a whiney, girly-boy sodomite? What was at most a minor footnote in the life of a great warrior (if that), writer/director Oliver Stone has given ridiculous preminence. Sadly, because of Stone's twisted delusions, this is how Alexander is now going to be perceived and remembered by many. If Alexander came back from the grave he'd beat Stone to a pulp for defamation of character.<br /><br />Catch this one only if you're into gay romance fantasy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The worst in the Terminator series"></head><body><p>This one is without a doubt the worst Terminator movie in the series. I didn't hate it, but it was only fun to watch the first time around. It's definitely the most violent, so if you're a total blood and gore fanatic you'll probably enjoy it more than I did. I love that kind of stuff, but it didn't seem to make me like it any better.</p></body></html>

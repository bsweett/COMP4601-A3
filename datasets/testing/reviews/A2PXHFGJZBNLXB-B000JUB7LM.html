When its first 90 minutes of boxing-movie cliches (however well-acted and directed) gave way to 40 final minutes of tearjerking, (eventually) morally-charged drama, I found myself unmoved. Instead, I just couldn't get past how contrived and melodramatic this last third of the movie seemed in comparison to the rest. Many people, of course, were applauding Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis' refusal to bow down to cliche towards the end of the picture; to me, though, the film's relentlessly catastrophic finale seemed more shameless than sincere. I balked.<br /><br />But the film had garnered so much praise, and won the 2004 Best Picture Oscar to boot, that the recent release of the film on DVD prompted me to look at it again. Now that I've re-seen it, I've basically come down to the following conclusion: I still think MILLION DOLLAR BABY is overrated, yet it may still be worth seeing all the same.<br /><br />What changed? Not much, really. I've always appreciated Clint Eastwood's style as a director. In a time when movies seem to be getting louder and flashier, here is an older-generation artist who makes films that are quiet, introspective, and character-based. While a lot of his films are basically genre films, Eastwood takes his time and utmost care to make films that make you care about the characters and situations onscreen. It's an approach that worked especially well in his 1992 Oscar-winner UNFORGIVEN and his 2003 film (maybe his masterpiece) MYSTIC RIVER, because both films also had resonant themes to go along with its stripped-down style. UNFORGIVEN was about the dehumanization of violence in man, and MYSTIC RIVER could be seen as a critique (though perhaps not necessarily a flat-out denunciation) of vigilante violence.<br /><br />What is MILLION DOLLAR BABY about, then? I guess it's ultimately a love story. No, the relationship between Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and her manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) never becomes the typical Hollywood-style love affair. It's a deeper love and admiration that develops between the two, and, as the tragedy unfolds towards the end of this film, that father-daughter-type relationship gets pushed to its emotional limits.<br /><br />The choice that Frankie ultimately must make is probably what most of the film's admirers love about MILLION DOLLAR BABY; it's perhaps the source of my biggest reservations about it. (SPOILER ALERT) Now, after seeing the movie again, I'll admit that the final 15 minutes---as Frankie is forced to choose between keeping Maggie alive or killing her---does have some power as human drama; it's a choice between showing your love for someone and personally sinning to do so, and Clint Eastwood has perhaps never been finer in characterizing this internal conflict in Frankie. But---even after all these months---I still can't quite get past Maggie's decision, and how wrong it feels to me in the context of the Maggie the rest of the film has shown us. Here's a character who is pretty much heart personified: even when Frankie initially rejects her, even when her own mother decries her boxing, and even when she starts to face slightly tougher opponents, she never fails to show steely determination. But then the twist comes, she sustains a paralyzing spinal cord injury, and, when the personal horrors start to pile up (the last straw is when she is forced to lose her legs thanks to bedsores that form on them), she decides to ask Frankie to put her out of her misery. When I saw MILLION DOLLAR BABY in the theater months ago, at the time I simply didn't believe that the eternally-optimistic Maggie would have made that kind of decision---not the way Paul Haggis had written the character, and certainly not the way Hilary Swank played her, even during the hospital scenes preceding that important decision scene. I tried to put such a misgiving out of my mind in watching the film for a second time, and I think I was able to appreciate that, ultimately, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is more Frankie's story than Maggie's---it's less about Maggie's rise to the top than about how Frankie, with Maggie's help, opens his heart and stops "protecting himself." Still, I think the problem with the way the film approaches Maggie's decision is that there isn't enough of an attempt to depict her change from determined to suicidal; it just happens one fateful night, out of the blue. To mildly cynical me, it comes off as more a bald attempt to shock and jerk tears rather than a serious examination of the moral and ethical dilemma of euthanasia...in other words, manipulative.<br /><br />In fact, almost all of this bleak final act of MILLION DOLLAR BABY engendered a similar feeling: yes, it may be a bold move on the part of the filmmakers to shift into such dark territory in the midst of what has so far been typical boxing-underdog drama. It's daring, but I don't think it pays off: there's little during the emotionally draining final act to suggest a deepening of themes presented in the first two-thirds. Instead, it feels like two different movies in one, and there's barely a connecting thread to give both parts a kind of unity to it---except maybe its idea of boxing as a metaphor for life. Instead of trying to tackle his themes head-on, Haggis and Eastwood take the easy approach: overlay it upon a comfortingly familiar underdog tale, and then sucker punch their way into the "important" part. It felt crudely manipulative to me in the theater, and---as well-done as the ending is---it still feels that way to me now. At least MYSTIC RIVER's tragic ending was all of a piece with its dark vision; the sadness at the end of this film seems merely unearned.<br /><br />Despite my serious reservations, though I must give the film at least some credit for its, uh, unpredictability; for the grace that Eastwood brings to the film; for the compelling drama of the film's final 15 minutes; and especially for its actors. Clint Eastwood has only been getting better with age, and once again he uses our knowledge of his former tough-guy persona to surprise us with his vividness and emotional depth (especially towards the end). Morgan Freeman finally got an Oscar for his performance as Frankie's confidante Scrap, and, while the role is basically a rehash of the best-friend role he played in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Freeman is such an imaginative and authoritative actor that he still manages to find some fresh notes to his performance anyway. And then there's Hilary Swank---another Oscar-winner---who takes a terribly underwritten role---she's basically a device to get Frankie to open up---and injects with as much heart and conviction as she can muster. This may be an even more impressive characterization than her Brandon Teena in BOYS DON'T CRY (the source of her other acting Oscar), since Haggis doesn't really give her much to work with.<br /><br />I give MILLION DOLLAR BABY 3 stars, because, for all of its refreshing simplicity and grace, I find the film to be deeply flawed, with a problematic third act that strikes me as terribly contrived, manipulative, and heavy-handed. And yet, in spite of my reservations, this is perhaps a film worth seeing anyway, since at least the ending does give you something to think about and discuss. If any movie engenders deep discussions about life, death, and love after its over, I suppose it must be doing something right. And maybe the fact that the film forces me to go back and forth in my mind---as I think I've done in this review---means something. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not a masterpiece, but, in its own crude way, it's effective.</p></body></html>

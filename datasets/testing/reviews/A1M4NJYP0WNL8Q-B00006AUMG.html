Film producers seem driven to repeat as much of the original film as possible, and most story lines are never all that rich in the first place.  So I picked up 'Blade II' as lark, not even positive that I would want to review it.  What I never expected was a sequel so good that it made 'Blade' look like it was just practice.<p>When the film opens, you discover that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) never really shot himself in 'Blade'.  Instead, he was captured by vampires and has been used as a mobile blood bottle for the past few years.  Our first sight of Blade (Wesley Snipes) is Whistler's rescue.  Leaving a trail of dusted vampires, Blade takes his old mentor back home and administers vampire anti-venom.  There we meet Blade's new partner, Scud (Norman Reedus), who alternates between getting stoned and keeping Blade's supply of technological tricks working.<p>What follows is a spectacular attack by a pair of vampire ninjas who bear a message from Damskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), an ancient master vampire.  Vampirish reapers are eating the bloodsuckers of Prague as a snack before starting on the humans, and Damaskinos offers Blade the help of his vampire SWAT team, led by daughter, Nyssa (Leonor Varela), if Blade will consent to clean up the mess.  Blade, attracted by the idea of using vampires to kill even worse vampires, agrees.  And with that, the good times begin to roll.<p>The story, by David Goyer, is completely engaging.  It is full of noir imagery, with an almost Machiavellian plot, pitting modern technology with constant reminders of how ancient the vampire world really is.  In addition to the story itself, this film sports some of the most exotic fight choreography and digital imagery I have seen in this genre.  Director Guillermo Del Toro spares little to create a world of comic book intensity that draws heavily on anime for it's visual style.  The intent was to outdo the original production without imitating it in the least.  And that is exactly what he does.<p>If you have seen Blade, you already know that Wesley Snipes is perfect as the human vampire hybrid of few words and many moves.  And Kristofferson is equally perfect as the gritty sidekick.  Leonor Varela turns in a surprisingly good performance as the beautiful and deadly Nyssa.  And then there is Goss, and Kretschmann and Perlman and...  In fact, I could write several paragraphs of congratulatory praise for the entire cast, who were exceptional.  And then another for the music, the makeup, and the special effects.<p>If that is not enough, this two disk set contains enough 'making of...' and commentary material to make it a complete course in how to create a great horror action film.  Del Toro not only likes to talk about the hows and whys of this film, he does a very entertaining and thoughtful job of it.  Watching this was pure spooky fun and I heartily recommend it.</p></body></html>

I really liked and was impressed by Red Dragon, but this film is one of the best!  I missed Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, at first, but Julianne Moore's portrayal was excellent!  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Anthony Hopkins, again as Dr. Hannibal Lector, was superb!<br /><br />This movie started out with a scene that was powerful and lured you into the rest of the plot.  F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling is placed on restrictions and has to more or less take on finding Hannibal Lector after his escape.  She meets his only survivor and fourth victim, Mason Verger (a wealthy pedophile), played by Gary Oldman, because he reported he has more information on Lector.  Verger is severely deformed from maiming himself at Lector's request.  Verger is a bit odd and this only adds to the excitement of the movie.  Lector is hiding out in Italy. An Italian cop who overhears agent Starling's request for a tape, decides he wants to capture Lector himself to claim the reward.  Things go worse for Starling and she has to turn in her badge and weapons, pending an investigation.  At this point she is drawn in to find Lector.  The rest of the movie is so action packed, I didn't even realize that this is over 2 hours long!  This has plenty suspense, action and gore, yes, gore!  Watch it and enjoy this it is a fantastic movie, but would you except anything less from Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore?</p></body></html>

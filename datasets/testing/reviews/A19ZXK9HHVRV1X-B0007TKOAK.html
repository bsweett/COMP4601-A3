Miles is an aspiring writer whose recent failures in life have left him bruised, cynical and deeply depressed.  In fact, he feels like a loser on two fronts, both as an author and as a husband, for he has yet to have a single work of his published, and he has recently gotten divorced from a woman whom he obviously still loves deeply and whom he can't quite seem to let go of.  The one aspect of life in which Miles really seems to excel and in which his passion is given free rein is his connoisseurship of fine wine.  His buddy, Jack, is a has-been TV actor who has spent the last few years doing voiceover work for pharmaceutical commercials.  Jack wants his final week as a bachelor to be a non-stop orgy of wine, women and song, but Miles prefers a quiet week of three parts wine tasting to one part self pity.<br /><br />Like a rare, vintage Pinot Noir, "Sideways" is a film best appreciated by those with a finely developed taste for the subtle and offbeat.  What often happens with a "small" film that achieves an unexpectedly wide crossover success is that it tends to suffer a certain critical backlash from people who go into it with soaring expectations and come out wondering what all the fuss is about.  The ideal way to experience a film like "Sideways" is to allow it to sneak up on you, to let it catch you unawares with its uniqueness and charm.  But since none of us can turn back time to that particular moment of nascent discovery, we are forced to watch it through the filter of our own preconceived notions and expectations.<br /><br />All this is preparatory to saying that "Sideways" is a very enjoyable little film for those willing to give it a chance.  Not only are the premise and the setting novel and unique, but the film boasts some of the finest ensemble acting in any movie of recent years.  Paul Giamatti, long one of our most talented and underrated actors, gives a performance of tremendous understatement and restraint, creating an entire character as much through facial expressions and body language as through dialogue.  Miles isn't even all that likeable at times - he actually steals money from his own mother on her birthday then leaves without saying goodbye - but his lack of self-image, his clear-eyed rationality and his puppy dog vulnerability win us over anyway.  As the playboy, Jack, Thomas Hayden Church reveals a layer of sensitivity buried under all that cold-blooded crassness.  Playing the two women who enter into their lives that week, Sandra Oh and, especially, Virginia Madsen provide a sweetness and warmth that contrasts nicely with these two emotionally stunted middle-aged "losers."<br /><br />In a perfect blending of form and content, Payne and co-author Jim Taylor have created a tasty mixture of revelatory conversation, understated humor and lyrical camerawork.  So sit back, uncork a bottle of your favorite vintage and enjoy the aperitif that is "Sideways."</p></body></html>

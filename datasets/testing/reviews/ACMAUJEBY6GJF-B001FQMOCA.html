<meta name="summary" content="Gripping story of a legend..."></head><body><p>...and I guess, despite some "evil" rumours about wether "Walk the line" is true to Cashs' real life or not, this movie should answer many questions. Personally I didn't really know that much about Johnny Cash before I went to see this movie, and I must say it made a deep impression.<br /><br />It is a sad story, and you really struggle with Cash throughout the movie. His life indeed was no picnic, being the invisible son to his fathers' eyes, the loss of his best friend and older brother favored of the two even long after his early, tragic death (this truely haunts Johnny Cash, and the cold relationship between him and his father), his drug and alcohol abuse the way it grows along with his carreer, his turbulent marriage, Johnny Cash simply doesn't function until he is gradually saved by his one and only true love -June Carter. From his early days listening to her voice on the radio as a kid (she was a child star), it also grows to become a gripping, beautiful lovestory. "Walk the line" introduces Johnny Cash as a kind and gentle, but a soulsick and lonely man. Until the outcome of his relationship with June Carter that is. The ending has a tone of the "...and they lived happily ever after..."-kind, and it is well earned!<br /><br />It is brilliantly expressed between many of his old music-classics, with great acting and the dialogue in focus. The filming could not have been better, and the timing -well, not an uninteresting, dull moment. J.Phoenix is Johnny Cash, R.Witherspoon is June Carter -and I must say that especially she managed to impress me (and perhaps for the first time, the girl can act!) I was impressed by Val Kilmer in "The Doors", I am just as impressed by J.Phoenix from his appearence in "Walk the line".<br /><br />See this film!</p></body></html>

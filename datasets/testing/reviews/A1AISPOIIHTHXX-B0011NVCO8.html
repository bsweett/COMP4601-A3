<meta name="summary" content="Impressive set, good movie"></head><body><p>Despite the fact I like Blade Runner and Alien, I always found Ridley Scott's career rather spotty. Known not sticking to the same genre, there's times where he'll offer an interesting film, other times he misses the ball severely and others will outright praise a film that really had little to go for it. That's where I always find fault with his films, especially current ones: they're directed with such gusto and flair and outright spectacle at times that whatever story there is gets excused since it's got an "epic" story thanks to the visuals. American Gangster doesn't have the huge visuals but it's long with lots of speaking roles and is one of those kind of films where it'll entertain you in spots and divide in others.<br /><br />After Bumpy Johnson dies, his right-hand man Frank Lucas takes up his mantel but does things a little differently this time. Rather than buying heroin from the Mafia, Lucas goes straight to the source in Southeast Asia, strikes a deal which cuts down on costs and thanks to Lucas' low price, it becomes a smash in Harlem though there's more overdoses thanks to the heroin's purity. Keeping family members involved and considerably well looked after, Lucas rises to the top of the drug underworld.<br /><br />On the other side of the law, Richie Roberts is an almost too-honest cop more well known for reporting near a million in unmarked bills than his cop work. With his personal life not as strong and cops not wanting to work with him because of his anti-corruption views, he eventually joins a drug task force designed to go after the big suppliers and players as opposed to small-town dealers. Unbeknownest to him, Lucas is the man to go after but how can you catch someone that doesn't even stand out in the crowd?<br /><br />I'm at that age finally where I can appreciate the more longer, character-driven films where emphasis is placed more on acting and pacing as opposed to getting the story over and done with (Seven Samurai, despite being over 3 hours, never feels it) but on occasion, a film comes out that, while not long as any others, still feels like trimming could've benefited the film. Like Kingdom of Heaven, it's not a film long because of so much twists and turns but rather just seeing character's lives and who they are. There's times where the story gets really fascinating and you get caught up in it but then others, you're looking at the running time and find only an hour has passed. It doesn't add anything to the genre or even does what it does the best, but it's probably hard film to walk out on as well.<br /><br />It's hard to deny that American Gangster is similar to other crime dramas but one that pops up is Heat with a look at both sides who are just as adept at what they do rather than good guy is good, bad guy evil. But whereas Robert De Niro's side is more interesting in that film, here the film is more on the good side since he's just as likable and interesting as a character and although Russell Crowe is quickly becoming like Martin Scorsese's own De Niro...(oh yeah, he doesn't use him anymore, more like DiCaprio), he does deliver a good performance. One that's disappointing is Denzel Washington since, despite having a strong screen presence, he's just not that interesting a character and seems more like his Training Day role part two.<br /><br />Like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven as well as the phenomenal Blade Runner release recently, Scott loves the big DVD's with tons of features. With the original as well as the extended cut along with several featurettes, it's an interesting look at the film that's just memorable enough to recommend but not enough to absolutely love.</p></body></html>

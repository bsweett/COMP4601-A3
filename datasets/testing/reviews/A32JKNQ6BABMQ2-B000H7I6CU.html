<meta name="summary" content="really cool for a kids show.maybe the 3rd best kids movie"></head><body><p>this movie was really cool.its not just about a few cars going left a lot in circles.first,theres a 3 way tie at the winston cup[nascars world series].this never happened before although kurt busch did finish 1st and jimmie johnson was 8 points behind 2 years ago.theres a lot of nasbar related stuff in there.1-only like 2 actual #s ftom a real nextel cup car are used.2-one of the cars on a 3 way tie is called the king.thays richard pettys old nickname.and the car was a old dodge superbird like the one ol king used to drive once.then theres a green and white car thats really aggressive.thats obviously dale earnhardt with a different paint job.then theres lightning mcqueen.hes the cool break out rookie who gas a chance to break a record by being the 1st rookie to be champ.anyhow,those 3 must race in a 3 car only race off at the end of the movie.any nascar fan i think will really enjoy it.it isnt just tossed together.someone actualy took time to research racesars.there the bump and run ,drafting,the skingshot and also as an asses bonus the racecars do famous things from nascar history like the pass in the grass and winning a race backwards.i think in all movies for children only toy story 1 and 2 are better.there are 2 poinrs i didnt like.1-mcqueen isnt a very cool name for a manly racecar hotshot rookie.unless of course you mean lightning is like jeff gordon then it all makes sense.2-the other thing i didnt like was the outcome of the big race  at the end.of course i cant say who won but they were booed and  had stuff thrown at them.thats just not a good thing to teach kids eveb if they font know that car was patterned after the greatest racecar driver ever.</p></body></html>

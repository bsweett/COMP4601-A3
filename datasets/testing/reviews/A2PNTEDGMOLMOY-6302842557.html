Murray Abraham's Role of a Lifetime -- Amazing Film!"></head><body><p>&quot;Amadeus&quot; dares to tell the story of mediocrity, and in the words of the mediocre some astounding truths are told.  <p>Essentially narrated by the aged and suicidal Salieri in a &quot;confession&quot; to a young priest in the &quot;present day&quot; (actually 1823), former musical giant (composer of the &quot;greatest opera yet written&quot; that has been consigned to the ashbin of history) and now a wrinkled has-been, &quot;Amadeus&quot; ponders the plight of an ambitious man (Salieri) confronted by genius that he can never defeat on its own terms.  According to &quot;Amadeus,&quot; the results of this clash are not pretty. <p>The film opens spectacularly, with Salieri screaming &quot;Mozart&quot; against a black screen.  Soon we see Salieri, blood gushing from his self-slashed throat, being whisked through the streets of Vienna as the city dances and whirls to Mozart's exhilirating Symphony No. 25 in G Minor (don't worry -- you'll recognize it).  With an amazing economy, the film, directed by Milos Forman (and adapted  Paul Shaffer from his own stage work) establishes a world of wondrous palaces, hyper-elaborate dress, and astounding music.  No mere costume drama, &quot;Amadeus&quot; drops the viewer deep into the late 18th century in Vienna, then one of the most powerful cities in Europe and a cultural touchstone for the Western world.  This is the city to which all composers flock.<p>Salieri, with his crabbed hands and scratchy voice, tells of his early years, when he promises his soul to God in return for the ability to make music to honor God. He pledges his industry, his chastity, and his eternal devotion.  And, wonder of wonders, his dad (a merchant with no ear for music) dies, choking to death at lunch!  So Salieri is free to pursue his love of music, and it appears that God has granted Salieri his wish -- Salieri rises to become Court Composer for Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). <p>Well regarded, Salieri has his world turned upside down by the arrival of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, in an inspired casting coup).  Vulgar, impulsive, hedonistic, and supremely talented, Mozart's reputation as a genius has preceded him, but Salieri is horrified to see that Mozart is (almost) as concerned with debauchery as his music.  Even more horrifying, Salieri realizes that Mozart is more talented than he -- reading over Mozart's pages, Salieri groans, &quot;It was like he was taking dictation from God.&quot;<p>Why, God, why?  Salieri cannot fathom why God would make this creature the vehicle for such talent . . . talent that only Salieri seems to appreciate.  Mozart is popular with the masses, but cannot make a big splash with the Court . . . in part because the Emperor, who defines taste for the Court, has no ear for music.  When the Emperor yawns during one of Mozart's performances, Mozart is doomed.  The Emperor also has some priceless advice for Mozart -- don't use so many notes, becuase the human ear can only hear so many notes before it gets tired!  <p>Driven to despair by the continued genius flowing from Mozart's pen, Salieri rejects God and vows to destroy God's creature.  What follows is a descent into madness for both Salieri and Mozart.  Without getting overly sentimental, Forman and Shaffer spin a tale of surpassing beauty (Mozart's music) and tragedy (Mozart's death).  <p>Ultimately, Salieri proclaims that he is the champion of mediocrity everywhere.  As he is whisked away from the shell-shocked priest, Salieri absolves the various patients in his insane asylum, he also absolves the audience (who cannot help but feel mediocre in the face of Mozart's genius?).  In a pitch-perfect note, as the screen dissolves to final black, we again hear Mozart's aggravating, infuriating high-pitched giggle, and we know that it will forever haunt Salieri.<p>&quot;Amadeus&quot; throws us into the mania of composition for both Mozart and Salieri, the world of court intrigues, and the triumphs and agonies of success and failure for composers.  We understand Salieri's torture as his music grows fainter as Mozart's popularity soars -- even after Mozart's death.  This is a powerful film with a surprisingly dark theme, but it is required viewing for any fan of classical music.  <p>The soundtrack, by Sir Neville Mariner of the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, is astounding, and will have you rushing out to buy Mozart CDs as soon as the movie is over.</p></body></html>

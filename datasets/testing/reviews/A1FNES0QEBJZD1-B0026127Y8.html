<meta name="summary" content="Taken (2 disc extended Cut) on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>I find it amazing that you have to scroll through so many pages here to find anyone who is reviewing the blu ray disc and when they do, they just say that it was exciting and that they liked it.  Sorry, that is not a review. Once again, with Amazon's now downloadable viewing there is no separation of reviews of the downloaded versions, which are highly compressed, the standard def versions, and the blu ray versions.  Amazon would do us all a huge service by separating these 3 different formats of viewing.<br /><br />I don't give plot summaries or my opinions of the movies, the acting or any of that nonsense. If I didn't initially like a movie, I certainly wouldn't bother to buy it.  I will admit that when I first saw the film, my only complaint was that it was too short.<br /><br />Thus, this review focuses, as do all my reviews, only on the quality of the transfer to blu ray itself.<br /><br />The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and makes good use of the front sound stage with appropriate panning across the screen.  Not a whole lot for the rear channels in terms of discreet channeling as they are mostly used for ambient sound but not necessarily discreet foley effects.  There are many scenes where the rears could easily have been used for such but this is typical of theatrical releases who are stingy with their audio budgets.  Even an old movie like 'Air Force One' made great use of the rear channels so ' Taken' certainly could have.<br /><br />The video transfer is good.  Not great.  No grain, artifacts or any image issues and there are details in the shadows.  However, the overall color images are rather soft when, in many places, they really could and should have stood out more.  This is the reason why I lowered the great pop corn movie from 5 to 4 stars.  I don't believe that, if you already have the 2 disc version on Standard Def DVDs, that you will notice a truly significant enhancement between the two.  Not much, if any remastering was done here other than reformatting the film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />Lots of wasted space on the blu ray with trailers for other movies and not much else other than the usual commentaries that can be found on the SD DVDs.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review has been of help.  If so, please click that 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the right path with this review.</p></body></html>

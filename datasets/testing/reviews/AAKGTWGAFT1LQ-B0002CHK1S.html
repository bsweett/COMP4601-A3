<meta name="summary" content="Psychological horror, sci fi, drama, all add up to a classic film"></head><body><p>Back when Kurt Russell had more acting roles, it was good to see that he occupied his time by creating a partnership with John Carpenter. Never mind that this was a remake - it stands by itself for the reasons described above. The movie is perfectly paced and even though it has lighter moments, those don't last long.<br />It is an acting ensemble piece where there are no weak links in the casting.<br /><br />The audience remains as confused as the film's characters and all the elements of the plot take time in coming together. The beginning of the film doesn't make sense until the end - however, it is not a flashback.<br /><br />Some of the characters are on the verge of mental illness and the central event of the film just adds to the tension until something has to give, which it does in spectacular, violent and melancholy fashion.<br />In fact, one may feel deep sadness at the end of it.<br /><br />The film is a bit of a downer - there are only isolated action moments. In between is human desperation, as well as repeated failure in understanding and communicating, which the viewer shares. This film may well be both John's and Kurt's masterpiece.<br />Very highly recommended.</p></body></html>

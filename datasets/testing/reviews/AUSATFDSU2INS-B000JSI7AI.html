<meta name="summary" content="A tender story of a prohibited love"></head><body><p>The cinematographic achievements of Brokeback Mountain have been buried under the controversy generated by its argument: a homosexual relationship between two cowboys. Of course, such scandal was to be expected, because if there's a stereotype more traditional and almost sacred in the United States, is the rude and very masculine cowboy.<br /><br />The western is a genre associated with a misogynistic point of view, always related with iconic figures such as Clint Eastwood and the very macho John Wayne; so, from this limited scoop, it's not rare that Brokeback Mountain put itself in the eye of a storm.<br /><br />Based on a short novel written by Annie Proulx, the movie narrates the story between two men for almost twenty years. When they meet in the 60's, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two young kids hired to watch a herd of sheep. Ennis is the quiet, shy one, engaged to marry Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack is the free-spirited one, always happy, optimistic and a first-class dreamer. In Brokeback Mountain, both men surrender their souls to a forbidden love, and after doing this, they return to their routines, hoping to put behind a life-changing experience that would chase them forever.<br /><br />The years pass, and Jack and Ennis have their very decent and normal families. Until one day, they meet again. And this meeting marks the turbulent, painful and harrowing beginning of a prohibited and irregular relationship, with devastating consequences.<br /><br />Social prejudices, hypocritical morals, intolerance an narrow minds are some of the obstacles that Ennis and Jack's love must endure. The other obstacle, the worst, is their battle with themselves. Jack, more open and clear about what he wants, what happiness means to him, is more willing to make choices that will cost him, but he'll do them anyway. Ennis is more cautious, in part because he's incapable of admit who he really is, what are his true feelings, always afraid of what people will think, afraid of rejection, afraid of speak freely about his emotions.<br /><br />And here is where Brokeback Mountain succeeds. It's not an ordinary movie about two guys having sex or making out. It's a movie about a love that aspires, above everything, the freedom to love without censorship; a love that seeks respect, dignity and the opportunity to be lived at its fullest. Director Ang Lee has beautifully crafted one of the greatest love stories of all times, one that will transcend its characters. Slow, with a gorgeous cinematography and a paused tone, Brokeback Mountain is simply a moving and tragic tale of two secret lovers; and these lovers could very well be heterosexual. But then, who would find this original and interesting?</p></body></html>

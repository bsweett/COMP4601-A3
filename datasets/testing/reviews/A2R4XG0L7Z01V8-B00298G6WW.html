Not a big curly beard, but a nice bit of stubble, just adds a certain je nais sais quoi (or however you spell it.) Give me a bit of stubble rash anyday. It's always worth it. Guys always look sexier.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan & Greg Kinnear both sport moustaches in this movie. Do either of them look good? No. It looks like something's died underneath their noses.<br /><br />It doesn't detract from the movie in my opinion, it was distracting. Pierce plays the role of a hitman excellently, all he needed was an hoop earring, and he would have been the perfect sleazy guy. Just everything he did, from winking at underage girls, to dancing with 'Bean', was just ultimately creepy. At the beginning we see him waking up in bed with a naked woman, he has a wee peek under the covers, and then paints his toenails the same colour as hers. I know weird.<br /><br />It's pretty much a 'buddy' movie. Pierce & Greg play off against each other brilliantly as Julian and Danny respectively. Their relationship progresses, falls by the wayside, and then starts up again. They're very much the odd couple, but yet it does work. I thought Pierce was brilliant, and Greg, although a little dodgy at points, was good and a good calm to Pierce's unpredictability. I did feel it dragged a bit in the middle, just a little, but not in a lengthy way, where you get bored of the movie thankfully.<br /><br />The Matador is sadly forgettable, and not that impressive at points. It's a great movie to watch, but it's over before you know it, and then you forget about it. But it is a good movie.</p></body></html>

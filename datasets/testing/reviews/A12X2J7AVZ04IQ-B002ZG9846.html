Matthew Vaughn's very clever "Kick-Ass" has probably everything anyone would want in an action film: Comedy, Action, Love, really nefarious bad guys, Dumb moves, intrigue... everything! I couldn't possibly add anything, since it's all been said, but director Vaughn kept everything paced and centered, Aaron Johnson was endearing, Mark Strong is the meanest of bad guys, Christopher Mintz-Plass&eacute; showed that he can play more than McLovin, and Nicholas Cage was there, briefly, to keep some focus to the terrific subplot, and all involved were totally buying in to the insanity. Enough can't be said about the magnificent Chlo&eacute; Grace Moretz, an intuitive young actress who is a total natural, best in the film. This review may not be read, but I'm compelled to get in my 5-stars.</p></body></html>

Straight from Pixar/Disney entertainment, we get a fun, freewheeling adventure that is always witty, fresh, and funny.<br /><br />Our hero is Remy (Patton Oswalt) a rat with a lot on his plate.  Survival is his family's primary purpose in life, but Remy doesn't want just to survive, he wants to live.  Having a particularly astute olfactory sense, he disdains the garbage dump for a tastier venue.  When he and his community are evicted from their peasant woman's place, it's a narrow escape at best. Remy is separated from the rest, so he ventures off to see the sights of Paris.  There he happens upon Gusteau's 5-star restaurant, a place where the owner inspires everyone, "That anyone can cook".  Gusteau dies of heartache after his place is demoted to 4-star status by critic nemesis Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) known as "The Grim Eater".  Once inside he keeps a low-profile until he comes upon newly hired hand Linguini (Lou Romano) who hands his letter of recommendation from Gusteau's widow to Skinner, the manager.  Skinner is a low-down greedy type who lends the Gusteau name to less haute frozen food cuisine.  In his repertoire are recipes for sabotage and a detective to find Linguini's true heritage to prevent him becoming the restaurant's heir.  Reme' elevates Linguini's cuisine skills with distinctive communication they keep under his hat.  Besides a hostile critic and manager, Linguini faces Collette, a beautiful fellow cook who must bear all the talent but none of the stature of men.<br /><br />'Ratatouille' is thoroughly delightful.  The plot is seasoned with imaginative ingredients that never falter for entertainment.  The peril is creative, and the story is marinated to perfection.  With such a clever and witty script (written by five writers, no less) the pace and execution is suitable for every palate.  It is hard to imagine a better family entertainment for 2007.  'Ratatouille' is the animated film to top.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not technically a 'Superhero' movie"></head><body><p>Not familiar with the graphic novels, I can only state my opinion regarding the film. When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I instantly knew it was the greatest movie trailer I have ever seen, and probably will see. It was like nothing I had ever witnessed. I was hooked without knowing literally anything about the film, the comics, the characters, or the plot.<br /><br />Upon watching it, I knew I liked it alot, but wasn't sure whether I loved it. With so much packed into movie that-even at 3 hours, is a bit short- I knew it would require multiple viewings before I could form a proper opinion. The plot is a bit confusing and so much is going on at the same time, that it becomes difficult to keep track of everything, unless you are familiar with the graphic novels, I assume.<br /><br />Character-wise, I thought everyone did a fantastic job. Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach were my two faves. I love characters with depth and mystery, and they had both in abundance. The rest of the cast is just as strong and well-balanced in film.<br /><br />The special effects are just ridiculously awesome. There really cannot be one single complaint about anything visual on screen.<br /><br />Plot-wise, I think the director did a fine job in the allotted time and while convoluted and messy at times, it was still enjoyable enough to keep my interest for the entire film-and wish for even more.<br /><br />A word of caution, though by now everyone probably has figured out that this film is quite adult in every regard and cannot be put in the same league as your standard comic book films. This is not Spiderman. It is not even Batman. This is a very graphic  anti-superhero film with enough blood, language, nudity, violence and sexual content to keep any ADULT happily engaged. I do not, under any circumstances, recommend anyone under the age of 17 to watch this.</p></body></html>

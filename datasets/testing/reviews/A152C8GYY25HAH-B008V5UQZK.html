<meta name="summary" content="Romantic comedy is as sweet and charming as they come"></head><body><p>It isn't easy to comment on "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" as a movie without mentioning its boxoffice performance. The independent production cost five million dollars, about ten per cent of the price tag for an average Hollywood studio movie. With a very small promotional budget, it opened on a few screens on April 19, 2002 and should have vanished a couple of months later. Instead, it built and built, taking in nearly a quarter of a billion dollars domestically. The fifth highest grossing movie of 2002, it outdid such high profile titles as "Signs", "Goldmember", and "Men in Black II".<p>This very simple romance is about Toula [Nia Vardalos], an ordinary-looking, second generation Greek woman of thirty who meets and falls in love with Ian [John Corbett], a very tall and very WASP school teacher. This does not sit well with her family, especially her father, who always assumed she'd marry a nice Greek boy. The movie tells the sweet, often hilarious story of how two people from different worlds go from first meeting to the altar. <p>The cast includes some great character actors, including Michael Constantine, Lanie Kazan and Andrea Martin. Ms. Vardalos wrote the witty, semi-autobiographical script. <p>It's hard to pinpoint what made "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" the most successful independent movie ever. It's far from the best movie of 2002; indeed, it's rather slight. One factor may be that it's about unconditional love. From the moment they meet, Toula and Ian are destined to be together. They work through every obstacle without ever resorting to the stupid arguments that abound in most other romantic comedy. They never try to change one another. And they are so filled with the joy and wonder of having found each other, the audience can not help but be filled with joy and wonder, too.</p></body></html>

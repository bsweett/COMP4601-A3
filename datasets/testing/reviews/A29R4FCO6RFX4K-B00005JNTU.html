<meta name="summary" content="Not excactly fantastic but good fun"></head><body><p>While an obvious improvement over the infamous (and excremental) 1994 version, this take on the story of the FANTASTIC FOUR just isn't all that fantastic. This movie is a suitable summer superhero flick, but after the recent and truly fantastic BATMAN, SPIDER-MAN, and X-MEN offerings, FF comes off as a merely adequate film that would have been more satisfying prior to the year 2000, before the bar had been raised. The action and the top-notch SFX are the film's selling points, and while this affable summer blockbuster dishes of plenty of bangs, it doesn't quite click the way previous MARVEL offerings did. Of course, you should see it on the big screen for the stunning big-scale visuals and kinetic zest, but these days you need to put everything you have on the screen, or they'll just walk out and watch the Adam Sandler movie playing in the next cinema.<br /><br />Each actor brings just enough life into each role and not an ounce more. There's more personality retread than human exposition, and character development is left to a loop of traits. Johnny Storm/The Human Torch is a cocky thrill seeker and impatient daredevil, Ben Grimm/The Thing is grumpy over Johnny's antics and his physical transformation, and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is a hopeless nerd who keeps snuffing the flame between himself and Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Together, the Fantastic Four face off against Dr. Victor Von Doom, a power-hungry millionaire with convenient menace. Don't worry about short-term memory loss; the film doesn't miss an opportunity to remind the audience how one-note each character.<br /><br />After a bridge accident that quickly and conveniently escalates in order to give each of the Four a chance to showcase their talents, the plot meanders around with the group dynamic before climaxing in a showdown with Von Doom that once again provides the opportunity for each hero to shine once more. Thankfully, the plot keeps moving, but director Tim Story (BARBERSHOP, TAXI) is a strange choice for helming FF. His lack of experience shows here, and that's the film's biggest flaw. Nevertheless, who cares really? Go see it on a Friday night with a big box of popcorn and some good friends and you'll be guaranteed an entertaining comic book flick. But next time round, should a sequel be green-lit, the script should be put before spectacle.</p></body></html>

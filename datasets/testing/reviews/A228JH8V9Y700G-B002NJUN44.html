The only reason I picked this up was because I have a thing for Garret Hedlund (the guy who plays Mertock).  He did a good job despite all the annoying preachy dialogue, and being a tool of the special effects department.  Otherwise the movie just drags on forever in your typical good and evil magical conflict.  He's wonderful eye candy no matter where he is to me, but that was this one saving grace in my eyes.  Otherwise it could have been much more than it was, moving quicker and trimming the fat.</p></body></html>

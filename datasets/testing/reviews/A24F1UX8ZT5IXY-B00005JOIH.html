An utter bore that evades the true issues."></head><body><p>"Munich" is a mishandled, self-important, shallow glossing of every party involved in the horrendous brutality of terrorism; the nadir for Stephen Spielberg in his futile quest to be treated as a legitimate intellectual.<br /><br />Let's begin with the genre to which Munich is wed: the 1970s-era political thriller. To deny that this is the vernacular in which the film should have been presented is a major mistake. Unfortunately, instead of learning the lessons of these often haunting films, Spielberg, in his confusion, has opted for shakey-cam verisimilitude woefully married to his usual pretentious directoral "god-like" sentimentality. Worse still are the flashback sequences to the Munich Olympics themselves: akin to something one would see on the History Channel, ersatz-journalistic drama that falls flat on its face.<br /><br />But the real problem with Munich: a painful, juvenile, laughable script by the most overrated writer in America (though many could challenge this throne), Tony Kushner. I knew we were in trouble from the first scene with Golda Meir -- the preposterous drivel spilling from her mouth, the "smoke-filled" situation room, oh please please please. The dialogue throughout the film has all of the subtley of a rock hammer, bringing into glaring relief the core ineptitude of the film: the world seen through the dangerous lens of sequestered, infantile humanism. Kushner is no historian, and even less of a political insider. He writes like a 15-year-old, and since Spielberg's highest grade of formal education is high school, this is a perfect marriage of ignorami.<br /><br />Yet Munich is worse than just a pointless film, it is a failure on every level. Each character an agenda, every plot point a shakey timber. It is offensive in the extreme; built around an untenable central thesis regarding the failure of retributon.  It is not just callow and despicable, but exists in a realm totally divorced from reality. The terrorists who perpetrated the atrocities in Munich are the lowest form of scum on the planet, and eradication of their likes is a necessary evil. This last statement is 180 degrees from the stand Munich takes. 180. A film like Munich is an affront to the people who have sacrificed their lives to protect civilization from these barbarians.<br /><br />The Olympics themselves are a peaceful congregation of antipathetic governments meeting in the most civilized arena. That is what made the murders so heinous, so incredibly despicable. Spielberg and Kushner even fail at conveying this with any resonance; their weak set-up to the film evinces a total lack of understanding of the emotion that surrounded the incomprehensibly depressing and tragic events that initiated the Mossad assignment.<br /><br />If you want to understand the massacre in Munich, watch "One Day In September", a masterfully-produced documentary that transcends this dramatization in every way.</p></body></html>

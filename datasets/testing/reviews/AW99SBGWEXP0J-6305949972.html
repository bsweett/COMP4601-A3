<meta name="summary" content="The Nightmare Before Christmas 3-D"></head><body><p>In Halloween Town, October 31 is the biggest night of the year.  Jack Skellington (Sarandon & Elfman), organizer of the festivities has got the blues.  He wants something different in his life, and while wandering in the forest, he finds a door to Christmas Town.  In Christmas Town, things are bright and cheerful.  It captures his interest, and when he returns to Halloween Town, he announces that this year, they will celebrate Christmas.  In fact, Jack will even replace "Sandy Claws" on Christmas to help spread the cheer.  He has it all planned out, but Salle (O'Hara) has a premonition that things will go terribly wrong.<br /><br />"Nightmare" has developed a following since it's initial release in 1993.  The stop-motion animation as well as the melding of Halloween and Christmas has captivated many, and Disney's decision to release it in 3-D is a welcome event for those people.  I think even a regular re-release would drum up some excitement.  The animation is top notch, and the story idea is an interesting one, but for me the execution of the story falls a little flat.  That being said, "Nightmare" is still worth seeing, especially in 3-D.</p></body></html>

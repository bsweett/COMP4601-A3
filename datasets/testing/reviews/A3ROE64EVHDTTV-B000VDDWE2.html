Very detailed, vivid, and exciting.<br />*Some memorable scenes.<br />*Storyline is relatively engaging; hardly boring.<br />*I suppose this is somewhat relevant to today's issues concerning climate change.<br />*Acting was not too bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Highly unbelievable.  Even if supercell storm systems have some kind of wierd cold air front, there's no way helicopters could freeze over in seconds and crash.  Some parts are downright silly; people were literally running away from growing frost.<br />*Sometimes, the characters act dumb; a few parts where you could yell at the screen for the people to run and seek shelter.  However, some of this stupidity is believable.<br />*Heavy focus on drama can be seen as sappy.<br /><br />Only a step better than other disaster movies like "The Core," this film has a typical plot with typical characters.  It is well made, with fantastic special effects, some interesting imagery, and adequate acting.  Some aspects can also be relevant to modern-day issues in climate change (and possibly immigration).  It is still a little shallow and highly unbelievable.  Fans of disaster films, or people who like good special effects, should probably check this out.  Otherwise, it is quite weak.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Strange And Extremely Entertaining"></head><body><p>Wow! This has to be one of the more unusual movies I've ever seen, one that is leaves you shaking your head in amazement. I am hesitant to say too much for fear of ruining this for anyone who hasn't seen it. There is so much one could write, pro and con, about the material in here. Suffice to say if you like modern-day film noir, or "neo noir," as its often called.....then check this out.<br /><br />This is pure entertainment, two hours of a story that grabs you right from the start and never lets go; a very involving story. Kevin Costner and William Hurt are tremendous in here, and worth the price of the rental alone. The whole cast was good but the dialog between those two guys - one real and one imaginary - have to be heard to be believed. (After a second viewing, I'd have to add Dane Cook's blackmailer character as equally fascinating.)<br /><br />If you want something a little thought-provoking, edgy-yet-moralistic, good acting and photography, this is a pretty good value for your rental money.  I've read where the Blu-Ray version on this movie looks and sounds outstanding, too.</p></body></html>

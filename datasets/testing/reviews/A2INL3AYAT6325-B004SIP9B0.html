<meta name="summary" content="Good, interesting film  I BELIEVE IT"></head><body><p>I did not think I was going to like the film.  Had NO Interest in it when released.<br />Being from the United States I have NO interest in the British Royal Family, Princess Diana, any of them.<br /><br />I watched the film 1 day & did enjoy it.<br />Helen did deserve the Oscar for the role.  Only other film of hers I had ever seen was I was 1st in the door opening day for "The Mosquito Coast".<br /><br />And, I believe the film.  Yep, we knew they did NOT care about Diana.  Arranged marriage & she ended up cheating in the marriage as well.<br /><br />Has normal extras on the DVD.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED Helen did not do a commentary.  This is HER FILM & won the Oscar for it.  WHERE IS SHE?<br /><br />Of course, ruined by the I HATE THEM WHY WERE THEY MADE FLIP THE LITTLE FLAP OPEN DVD CASE.</p></body></html>

For one thing, I don't want to compare it to the original Halloween, since the original is supposed to be a classic and therefore, untouchable.<br /><br />Something was wrong with the pacing in this remade version though.<br /><br />The movie started off SO good when it was dealing with the little kid going crazy and killing everyone in sight.  He was being picked on at school by a bully, a stepfather that treated him poorly, and a sister he didn't like.  The only person the little boy liked was his mother.<br /><br />There was a disturbing aspect to the storyline in that watching the little boy kill people in graphic ways time and time again, you begin to realize for the boy there's no compassion for human life whatsoever.  A disturbing side of the horror genre when it deals with realistic and dangerous subjects such as that.<br /><br />They even touched upon the subject of whether the little boy actually felt anything when he was doing the killing.  Apparently not.<br /><br />This movie must have some kind of record for the most killings in a movie, haha.  Time and time again people would get slaughtered, smashed, stabbed, you name it, but the same unstoppable insane lunatic roaming the streets and suburbs.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie was how it started off so darn good and gradually got worse and worse until eventually you knew what was going to happen at the very end.  To me this is inexcusable for a movie that should have kept a consistent momentum that it had for the first hour or so.  Seriously, the first hour of the movie was pure horror perfection.  It just failed to keep the same exciting pace for the last 40 minutes or so because the final segments of the film were so predictable.<br /><br />The subject of the killer trying to find his sister had potential, but never delivered.  What was he planning to do with his baby sister once he found her?  Also, why did he kill that guy who was supposed to be his friend back at the psychiatric hospital?  The killer had no sympathy for someone that honestly cared about him for several years, you think he would have given the guy a break.<br /><br />But the most important thing is that the movie turned into a rather ordinary slasher horror by the second half of the movie, failing to come through.  I'll be generous and give the movie 4 stars anyway because I really did enjoy the first half of the movie with all the creative and constant killing action.</p></body></html>

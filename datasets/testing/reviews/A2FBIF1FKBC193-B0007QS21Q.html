<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable action flick for non sci-fi readers ..."></head><body><p>Based on a book writtten by the master, Isaac Asimov way way back in the 1940's it would be easy to level some cheap shot criticism at this movie for not being tru to the book... Give me a break ... one should rather be amazed at the absolute genious of the author to forsee our world of the future ...<br /><br />OK so there are some gaping holes in the writing and for the sci-fi analysts this must drive them absolutely NUTS ... good ... for the rest of us we can just sit back and spend an easy going afternoon watching Will Smith in a stupendour 'eye candy' type of action flick. Will Smith playing the paranoid detective Spooner is fabulous .. I truly believe that Smiths artistic work is certainly not appreciateed today ....<br /><br />What a great film and truly enjoyable which is more than I can say for a lot of the fare in the movies today where directors CONTINULLY try to push some political or religious agendy down my throat .... this is what movies are all about .. entertainment ....</p></body></html>

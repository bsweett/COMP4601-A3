<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful "old Hollywood" Christmas season romance"></head><body><p>I dreamed about writer-director  Nancy Myers' THE HOLIDAY last night.  It is a honey of a romantic comedy, something out of Hollywood's golden age.  No one smokes, witty dialogue substitutes for swearing, love scenes are passionate kisses, and violence is slapstick comedy.  Myers loves old Hollywood; with her ex-husband, Charles Shyer, she made the successful remakes of THE PARENT TRAP and FATHER OF THE BRIDE and its sequel.  By herself she wrote and directed the romantic and funny WHAT WOMEN WANT and SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.<br /><br />What a wonderful cast Myers has for THE HOLIDAY, which is about "house swapping" at Christmas time.  Kate Winslet (Iris) is a London journalist who lives in a storybook cottage south of London.  She finds that the man she loves is about to get married to someone else.  Cameron Diaz (Amanda) lives in a Beverly Hills mansion, designs movie trailers, and has just kicked out an unfaithful live-in boyfriend.  The two women "meet cute" on the Internet, Amanda answering Iris' ad for someone to swap houses for Christmas season.  It is perfect for both, as it always is in movies of this type and never is in real life--Iris is lonely in her cottage, while Amanda craves someplace small and quiet.  Diaz and Winslet are both wonderful.  Myers' lovely script makes them come alive as actresses with witty dialogue and romantic situations at holiday time.<br /><br />Soon Amanda finds Jude Law (Iris' brother Graham) on her English cottage doorstep and, of course, falls in love with him almost instantly, especially when she learns he is a widower with two small children.  And Iris has two very different men pop up in her life in Los Angeles:  Jack Black (KING KONG) as a film composer named Winston, and Eli Wallach (in his best role in decades) as a 90 year old retired screenwriter.  All of the performances are superb, miracle of miracles no one smokes or swears (thank you, Nancy), and Myers (and her designers) do magical things to contrast Los Angeles and rural England at Christmas season.<br /><br />The ending is Hollywood fairy tale romance that you can see coming from the film's mid-point on, but it still makes you feel in love with life and movies out of a bygone era.  The only flaws are a Hans Zimmer score so obtrusive that I had to turn on the English subtitles on my DVD player to get the dialogue, and the movie runs a bit too long at 136 minutes.  Otherwise, THE HOLIDAY is pure cinematic magic with five wonderful actors in peak form.  I can't wait to see what the incomparably talented Nancy Myers does next.</p></body></html>

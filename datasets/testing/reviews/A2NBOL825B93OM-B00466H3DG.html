<meta name="summary" content="Lives to be lived and watched"></head><body><p>Once again, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman provides us viewers with an intelligent, unusual and thought-provoking story. This time, he asks us what would we do if we were presented the possibility to erase bad past experiences from our minds. Would our lives be better? Is ignorance really bliss? Or is our existence a gathering of memories and happenings, for the better or for worse?<br /><br />Kaufman's answer is given throughout the movie. I tend to agree with him; but each viewer has to watch the movie to discover his or her personal truth.<br /><br />In the movie, Joel (Jim Carrey) has a very plain and uneventful life. Very boring, indeed. Until he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet) a blue-dyed-hair girl that wants to live her life at full speed, but doesn't have the courage to do so. Her life, in fact, is pretty much like Joel's. Both of them are lonely, and, even if they are very different from each other, they start off a relationship, completing each other. But, after a time, the relationship starts to go sour, and Clementine goes to Lacuna Inc., where Joel is simply and completely erased from her memory. Joel, angry, wants to do the same, but during the procedure he has second thoughts. Most of the movie is inside Joel's head, where he struggles to keep his memories of Clementine alive, literally running from the medical probe, jumping from one memory to the next. There are other good subplots (with Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson - one of the best actors of his generation, if not THE best) that make the movie whole.<br /><br />This "inside the brain" thing is what's best in the movie, because it provides room for Kaufman and french director Gondry to toy with unusual visual scenery, shots, landscapes and scene transitions. "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" is not science fiction, it's not drama, neither romance, least of all comedy - as happens to all Kaufman movies, the viewer gets a little depressed, and there's a feeling of impotence during the whole story; I would classify it as a filmed question, and the finality of this movie is to answer that question.<br /><br />Good acting by Jim Carrey (almost no faces this time), but I was really surprised by Kate Winslet: the smiley, somewhat awkward "Titanic" and "Sense and sensibility" girl plays a convincent out-of society, trying-to-be-independent and sad woman.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10</p></body></html>

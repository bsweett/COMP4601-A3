<meta name="summary" content="Better Than (and Hindered By) Volume One"></head><body><p>It's probably a good thing that Volume One and Volume Two of KILL BILL were never combined: there appear to be two different audiences that appreciated each one and probably would've been less enthused about one film.<br /><br />Volume One appeared to satisfy those who enjoyed fast-moving action and cartoonish bloodshed.<br /><br />Volume Two played to those who favor character and emotional development.<br /><br />I watched Volume Two even though I thought Volume One was thin and overrated.  And, no matter how good Two may be, it still has to take its story and characters from One.  Two makes a valiant effort, helped primarily by outstanding performances from Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and David Carradine, but it ends up trying to develop a deeper film from essentially a kung-fu parody.  (The tinny dramatic chords from 70's chop-socky movies reminds you of that throughout Two).<br /><br />Still, the lightest Tarantino fair is still more interesting than most movies out today.<br /><br />After reading this week that Tarantino plans to combine the films and rerelease them, I just hope he doesn't make more of KILL BILL than there really is.</p></body></html>

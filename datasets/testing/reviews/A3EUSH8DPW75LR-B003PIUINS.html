Sequels, especially in thrillers or horror movies, are often very subpar compared to the original.  Many critics weren't too thrilled with this sequel but I find that it far surpasses the original.  The acting is better, atmosphere and thrills are better and more importantly it serves a purpose.  We never actually find out why death needs to correct itself in this series but FD2 does contiue ther story from the first with fresher and more interesting faces.  As for the blu ray, the original was a diasppointment but here with FD2 blu ray is put to all its best use.  The video is crip and clear with vivid colors and a clarity that pulls the viewer in.  The clarity is what was strongly missing with the original on blu ray.  The audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and it will knock your socks off.  Dialogue is  strong and present throughout and all surround speakers are put to great use when the action kicks up.  Atmospheric music is creepy and the build up of each killing scene will have you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a car crash and the visual and audio presentation on blu ray is quite stunning.  And the bar is raised for the rest of the film due to its superb presentation.  I give it 4 rather than 5 stars for the video is a little dark but believe me it still hits all the right notes.  Watching this excellent film in blu ray will have you jumping out of your skin and being pulled into very entertaining thrills and chills.  This film shows why blu ray was made.  Highly recommend this film and the blu ray far surpasses the dvd.</p></body></html>

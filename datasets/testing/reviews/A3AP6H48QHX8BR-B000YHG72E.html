<meta name="summary" content="Best Christmas Comedy Since "A Christmas Story""></head><body><p>I read some of the reviews in the newspaper and was a little scared to give this comedy a try... but, I recieved as a gift and was TOTALLY blown away- the movie is a Christmastime perfection. A Christmas comedy that all ages in your family will be able to sit down and enjoy together.<br /><br />The movie begins when Buddy- a human raised by elves learns that he is a human. Which explains why he has had a beard since he was 15 and is ten times taller than the other elves. He learns that his real human dad lives in New York City- wanting to know his true father and find where he belongs Buddy leaves the North Pole for NYC. When Walter Hobbs meets his son- Buddy who he has never known about he is a little concerned- he has a a son and wife at home and is a hard-working book publisher who has lost the true spirit of Christmas. When Buddy shows up his whole life is turned upside... at first he chooses to acknowledge Buddy- but slowly decides to take Buddy in out of concern for his mental health- fearful Buddy is crazy... since he walks around in an elf costume, talks about the north pole, and puts sugar on spaghetti. Buddy slowly begins to fit into his family growing close to half brother Michael the two spend time together chopping down Christmas trees and throwing snowballs. Once Buddy begins to fit in- Walter out of anger yells at Buddy causing him to runaway. On Christmas-well all of a sudden Buddy finds himself needing to rely on his human friends and family when he finds Santa's sleigh in Central Park- and needs that Christmas spirit...<br /><br />The movie is cutesy to a point... no one can watch this movie and not be charmed by this movie. There is something very sweet and childlike about Buddy that makes you fall in love with him. Will Ferrell as always is a LAUGHING riot as the Christmas elf that brought him to super stardom.<br /><br />Children will enjoy the story and Buddy. Parents will love Buddy and love the popular culture jokes that kids may not pick up on... No matter how many times I watch this film I always LAUGH at the same parts. This movie will be one you'll enjoy again and again each Christmas and definately one I would recommend you own!<br /><br />The DVD features are possibly the best special features I've ever seen with two disks jammed with games, and interviews... this DVD is hours of fun for you and your children to enjoy.<br /><br />This is NO "Christmas With the Kranks" or "Surving Christmas" you'll actually enjoy watching this holiday flick more than once- making possibly the best Christmas comedy movie since "A Christmas Story" or the "Santa Clause"Definately a movie to buy or own this Christmas!</p></body></html>

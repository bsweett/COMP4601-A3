<meta name="summary" content="Gripping and unsettling; this `devil' deserves your attention..."></head><body><p>I'll start by saying that `Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' has a brilliant premise; utterly brilliant.  It doesn't always go about delivering that to us in the best way, but all nit-picking aside, there is no denying that the story itself is masterful.  I'll also say that Philip Seymour Hoffman is flawless in this movie.  I almost wish that I had watched this one more time before finalizing my personal awards for the year (`The Ellington Awards') for I most likely would have nominated Hoffman for his riveting and impeccable performance.<br /><br />No use griping about that now I guess.<br /><br />The film follows two brothers, Andy and Hank, as they embark on a twisted and disturbing attempt to make some quick cash.  Both Andy and Hank are dissatisfied with their lives.  Andy's wife Gina is depressed with the way her life is going and as the startling opening sequence proves; unless she's away from it all she is not satisfied.  He desires to make her happy, even if that means packing up and moving away.  Hank on the other hand is dealing with his hotheaded ex-wife Martha who is demanding unpaid child support from him.  Both brothers need money to fix their problems and Andy has a solution.  Andy proposes that they rob their parent's jewelry store.  They both used to work there so they know the safe combinations and they know the layout.  It seems like a flawless plan.<br /><br />But there is a flaw.<br /><br />`Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' brilliantly captures the steady decline of sanity when everything around you begins to fall disastrously apart.  After the botched robbery both Andy and Hank are left with a huge mess to clean up and as they try time and time again to make things go away the problems grow until there seems to be no way out for either of them.<br /><br />The films success relied heavy on the shoulders of the cast, but sadly Hoffman is really the only one who sinks into character.  Ethan Hawke has some great moments (his first scene for instance had me expecting him to dominate this movie) but he tends to get weepy and redundant.  Almost every scene shows him making the same clich&eacute;d mannerisms and expressions of guilt.  I've never thought of Hawke as a great actor.  He's touched upon greatness on a few occasions (I remember liking him in `Great Expectations' and `The Newton Boys') but he's never really crossed that line for me.  Marisa Tomei probably does the finest job here next to Hoffman.  Her portrayal of Gina is delicate and fabulously delivered.  Amy Ryan comes across like a very clich&eacute;d ex-wife.  Her character is nothing new and or different.  Albert Finney, an actor who is above and beyond brilliant, fails to really grab me here.  Like Hawke, his expressions of pain and sorrow are manic and generic.  He doesn't add any realism to his performance, which I found disappointing.  I expected more from him.  His final scene was flawlessly executed but until that point I had really no interest in him.<br /><br />I know that sounds like a lot of bad news, but none of the actors are `bad' in the typical sense.  All of the performances are well done it's just that Hoffman and Tomei are really the only two that stand out for me.  The other performances are fine, they are just clich&eacute;d, and this script deserved better than clich&eacute;d.<br /><br />Hoffman though is able to really get inside Andy and make him real to us.  While Andy has to deal with some clich&eacute;d `failing marriage' issues (and he does have that obvious drug habit) he commits one-hundred percent to making his character unique and memorable.  He is the only actor who displays a wide range of emotions, from self confident dominance to self pitied arrogance to uncontrolled rage to bitter solitude to repressed sorrow to released sorrow and even a bit of genuine joy.  He displays all of these emotions flawlessly.  Like I said, I really wish I had watched this another time before compiling my `best of the year' because this performance is brilliant.<br /><br />The script rarely disappoints.  I didn't care for some of the redundant dialog between the brothers but that really wasn't enough to harp on.  There are some extremely memorable scenes, especially when concerning Andy, scenes that help develop his character.  Character development was something I felt the movie soared in.  We really get a grasp of the desperation befalling these two brothers, as well as the grief stricken state of their father.  While Hoffman is the only one of the three who takes advantage of the scripts development and chews it up you can't deny that the characters are three-dimensional, every one of them.<br /><br />In the end I'll close by saying that `Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is a great movie, one I highly recommend.  It is five-star material and truly would have received them had Hoffman had some exceptional support.  In all actuality I would have rated this movie one of the top ten of the year, maybe even top five.  The story is probably one of my favorite of the year, concept wise (can't get past the clich&eacute;d characters), and the overall flow of the film is absorbing (Lumet directs with passion as always).  So see the film, for the story and for Hoffman and enjoy it because it truly is a very good film.</p></body></html>

The overall plot is completely believable, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman have excellent chemistry on film, and the movie has just the right mix of action and interesting dialogue.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays the mysterious interpreter Silvia Broome, a woman with a very mysterious past, though throughout the movie the viewer is never sure just how mysterious.  Kidman is perfect for this part.  She seems just as mysterious in real life, so this role did not require a whole lot of character change.  Still, she makes her character come to life on the big screen.<br /><br />Sean Penn plays a Secret Service agent assigned to investigate (and later on, protect) Kidman's character.  He doesn't deserve an Academy Award or anything, but he pulls off the job quite well.  Sean Penn is just a fun actor to watch.  I don't think he copies anyone else's style.  He is unique in his approach to his craft.<br /><br />I don't want to giveaway the plot of this film, so I will just say that there are a few turns and twist that keep the viewer guessing.  The rest of the cast, the directing, and the filming are all topnotch and enjoyable.<br /><br />As I said with the title, this movie is solid entertainment.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

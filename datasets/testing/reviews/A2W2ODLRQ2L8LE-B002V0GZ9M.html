<meta name="summary" content="A Romance / Si-Fi Mix that really Works"></head><body><p>Ladies, if you have a hard time getting your boyfriend/husband to sit with you and enjoy a romantic movie, this gem may just do the trick.<br /><br />This story starts out simple enough, but before long you start to realise that the Lake House has a time-looped mailed box. The time loop is about 2 years. But understanding how the mail box works will be the key to them ultimately meeting and enjoying a long term relationship.<br /><br />The film carries a melancoly feel to it, where, their relationship continues to be just beyond their grasp all the time. Eventually when all seems to be lost, the mail box must be used in a last ditch effort to save the relationship. It is a brilliant story with a glorious ending.</p></body></html>

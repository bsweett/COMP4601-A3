<meta name="summary" content="Thrilling Sci-Fi Adventure"></head><body><p>It is true that there are many similarities between this and other Sci-Fi stories. Human beings are oppressed by a government like in &quot;1984&quot; (except Big Brother is known as Father), pieces of art or otherwise items that make you &quot;feel&quot; are burned, destroyed, or taken like in &quot;Farenheit 412,&quot; and some of the city scenes remind me of futuristic films like &quot;Brazil&quot; or the animated film &quot;Metropolis.&quot; However, the film takes it all its own in one storyline and unlike other films (like Star Wars Episode II) doesn't make you feel like you're just watching a carbon copied movie.<p>The futuristic society of this movie oppresses its citizens by removing &quot;feeling,&quot; which includes movies, paintings, books, cute puppies, any thing that would change your bland nature. Imagine a more serious version of &quot;Demolition Man.&quot; Like the latter, there's a rebel group known as the Underground that just wants to live their lives the way they want too. Enter our hero, a &quot;Cleric.&quot; The Clerics practice a form of martial arts that utilizes both body, mind...and firepower. While it will probably be a while before we see a type of person like the Cleric, the movie presents it in a fairly realistic manner and you're never left feeling &quot;Yeah...right.&quot; Unlike what other reviewers have said, it doesn't feel too much like the Matrix. There is no bullet dodging or slow motion shoot outs, the Clerics merely use quick calculation and smooth, flowing movement to decide who to kill first and how to avoid getting shot themselves. Its believable.<p>The movie has some excellent action and some unforgettable lines and scenes. Its definately worth at least a rental. I'm definately planning on buying it some day.</p></body></html>

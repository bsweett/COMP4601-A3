It's scarier than previous "haunted houses or motels movies" such as The Haunting, Identity, The People Under The Stairs, and last year's The Grudge. Since it's based on a true story, it's even more compelling and powerful. It's filled with plenty of shocking and scary visuals, and the story is real and intense that it's quite a gripping experience to watch this freak feast! A bonus treat of eye-candy is offered by Ryan Reynolds to his fans if they haven't seen him all buffed up in Blade:Trinity last year. He's drop-dead gorgeous in this movie, with a body that made a lot of female audiences go,"Ooh,Wow!" for at least four scenes. I guessed it was appropiate that he needed to built an ultra-muscular body for his role since his character is in construction work.<br /><br />The story is about the Amityville old house that is possessed by a powerful demon. It took place in Deer Lake in the '70s. The intro of the film showed one possessed member of the Deferoe family killing all of his family on the 28th day at 3:15am since they moved in. A year later, a new family moved into the same evil house. George(Ryan Reynolds) and his wife Kathy(Melisa George) disregard the realtor when they were told  about the killing that took place in the house. They took it, because it was so cheap. With all good intension, they believe that their family will make a happy home there. George is the step father to Kathy's two sons and one daughter. Their dad died and Kathy remarried to George.<br /><br />Between day one and the final manifestation of the evil force, many strange, wierd, and scary things occur in their house. Chelsea(Chloe Moretz) had the ability to see an earth-bound ghost girl from the previous family, and they became friends. She was warned that her family must abandon the house, but the parents ignored the message. Gradually, "the voices that said Katch'em and Kill'em" got into George's mind, and he started to lose it one day at a time. Now the only person who started to believe that something is really wrong with the house is Kathy, and she goes to seek the help of a local preist(Father Callaway/Philip Baker Hall)......<br /><br />The characters are very well-written here, and the development of the story from beginning to the climatic moment is at a perfect pace. Every 5 minutes there is something very scary to happen, and the performances, especially from Reynolds and Melissa George are powerful and intense. The three kids and the ghost girl are also effective in some of the scary moments. The sudden popping up of evil faces is what made many audiences scream throughout the film. Philip Baker Hall, previously displayed great performance in Magnolia has too little screen time here. His best scene was when he tried to perform a blessing vitual inside the evil house.<br /><br />This film should be a must-see for horror fans, and definitely not-to-be-missed by Ryan Reynolds fans, because he deserves extra credit for his gripping performance as well as showing off his fabulous body!</p></body></html>

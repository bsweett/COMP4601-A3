There is no real moral base he seeks to induce from his films and this is possibly why this movie is such an enjoyable watch.(i might be wrong i should add cause this was my first watch) For all those, who seek humor from this movie and enjoyed Clockwork Orange just for the humor bit,friends,I dare say, you don't deserve to watch films of this high a statute. Without trying to sound too much like a prude, "A Clockwork Orange" is gripping,unabrasive,interesting and big yet not ready for an immediate second watch.<br /><br />The characters in the film are few and simple, the dialogue writing is of supreme nature and the sets are extraordinarily rich with chaos and flamboyance of color. The first fifteen minutes of the film brought quite a jolt of shock to me owing to the graphic nature depicted. Interestingly enough, the main character is a huge Beethoven fan and has a life without pauses and limits. WHERE THE FILM SCORES FULL MARKS is in the character of Alex,who is one easy to dislike rodent.Somehow his narration is extremely likeable.<br /><br />Second most interesting character in this film would be the old man on the wheel chair and his crazy fatigued lifestyle. Everyone in this movie other than Alex is dislikeable as far as storyline makes you beleive. My favourite scene in the film would have to be a choice between Alexander's moodshift when he's sent to prison and his torture scenes OR the beginning of the movie where his rather scarily determined eyes pierce the watcher.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldnt be shameful enough to rate this. Yes, it is a classic that is not gonna die soon. I'll read the book in a year's time.</p></body></html>

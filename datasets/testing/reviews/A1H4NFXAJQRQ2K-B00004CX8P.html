<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, not so great Blu-ray transfer"></head><body><p>Basically I love this film, slow burn plot with strong classic finish. So that's not the point of my review, this is not one of the more vivid looking Blu-rays i've ever seen, i'd argue that an upscaled dvd would look just as good if not better. The colors are muted, bordering on blurry, but not quite. Some scenes look ok, but compared to things like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, yes is typed that.... that movie Blu-ray looks amazingly vivid compared to this and it's an older film. So, i can't see why this looks so average?</p></body></html>

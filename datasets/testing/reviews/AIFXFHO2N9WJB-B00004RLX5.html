With that thought in mind, Paramount Pictures commissioned Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer (director of "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan") to begin writing the next installment.  Also back for the sequel would be the director of "Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock", Leonard Nimoy who just so happened to be the actor who has portrayed Spock since the original TV series.  Along with Nimoy and the writers, Paramount Pictures was smart enough to realize that this franchise would be nothing if they didn't get the entire cast and crew back together again, and this time enticing them to return would prove much easier especially with the promise of this film being totally different from what has been done before.  Thus, "Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" was born.<br /><br />After defeating Khan and finding their once dead, now resurrected friend Spock, Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the starship Enterprise are finally approaching Earth and spacedock so that the Enterprise may be decommissioned once and for all.  However, before they can reach their final destination an alien entity is threatening Earth by evaporating the oceans and destroying the atmosphere.  In a desperate attempt to stop this threat and save mankind, Kirk and his crew must travel back in time, to the year 1986, in order to find the solution that will cause the entity to be satisfied in whatever its search entails, and move on to another planet or star system.  But time is running out, and the solution is proving difficult to come by, especially since the Enterprise has still not been fully repaired from its recent battles (as depicted in the previous two films), so will Earth in the 23rd Century be saved, or will the time-displaced heroes learn to cope with their new surroundings.<br /><br />"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" served as an excellent example of exactly what to do to make sure a franchise does not become stagnate in its storytelling capabilities.  The writers, along with director and star Leonard Nimoy, were very crafty in terms of infusing the story with deeply emotional beats throughout the overall story, and infusing more humor than there has ever been in a `Star Trek' movie to date.  Many times placing too much humor in a franchise that had previously only had very little can prove to be detrimental to the series' longevity and success ("Superman 3" and "Batman & Robin" are two prime examples), however the creators of this film were careful not to get too carried away with the humor and risk losing touch with their core audience of Trekkies.  Sure there were some Trekkies that were somewhat disappointed with the film's storyline, even some of the actors were skeptical, mostly because time travel is such a touchy subject for movies, and generally feels like a cheap ploy for the writer to use to get him or herself out of a corner that they've painted themselves into.  But this was not the case here, and regardless of what some fans say, "Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" is one of the more popular, and profitable films in the franchise, as it accomplished what previous installments and even some of the subsequent installments failed to do, expand upon the core audience and make the movie appeal to almost everybody.<br /><br />The acting was still very well done, all of the cast did an excellent job with handling the fish-out-of-water aspects that the storyline required, and it was clear that they were all loving every minute of it.  Of course, that was probably aided by the fact that their director was also their close friend and colleague, Leonard Nimoy, who shows that he was not merely a flash in the pan after his first directorial effort in the `Star Trek' universe with "Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock", and with this film he showed that he not only had the knack for drama and sci-fi action/adventure, but also knew how to bring broad strokes of humor into the story without it feeling heavy-handed or out of place.  The special effects were all relatively well done, especially for the time, and most hold up well to this day, of course this was another area where Nimoy chose to change things up in the franchise, by not making the movie be overly loaded with special effects but instead be more character driven.  A choice that I'm confident assisted in the mass appeal of the film, and allowed the franchise to continue to flourish for years to come.<br /><br />Overall, "Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" stands out as one of the better sequels in the franchise, and possibly one of the best examples of branching out in terms of any sci-fi franchise.  If you are a fan of the series in any way, or merely looking for a good blend of sci-fi, action, humor, and drama then look no further, and the beautiful thing is you really don't need much of the backstory that had been setup in the previous films, although it would help in some areas, but even without it you could still enjoy the movie.  This is one `Star Trek' film the entire family can enjoy, yes even the ladies will enjoy this one.<br /><br />"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" is rated PG for language.</p></body></html>

I bought it on the off-chance that I would like it, plus it had Eliza Dushku in it. I couldn't find any DVDs that I literally had to buy - plus I had plenty of money! - so I closed my eyes and made a grab for one. And this was in my hand! I wasn't sure what to expect from this - I vaguely remember publicity for it coming out, but didn't know the storyline or anything.<p>I was quite surprised to discover that Stan Winston had a hand in producing this movie. I was disappointed when I saw his inbred &quot;monsters&quot;. They weren't up to his usual standards from great movies such as Jurassic Park and the Terminator movies. I didn't find them scary at all, and they have very little screen time for the amount of makeup the poor guys have to sit through. Quite often the inbreds are seen from far away, or from behind. <p>It's your typical 'teen' slasher flick, but with a more interesting approach to the film itself and the killings. The killings are very well thought out, and not your usual killings that you find. The best killing has to be Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), who is decapitated through the head. This is a very freaky scene, as it's shown how they managed to do it in the extras. They also mention wanting the eyes to blink before you realise what's happened, which would have been absolutely wicked! But they don't do that unfortunately. Also, everyone gets separated, which is a must in these kind of films.<p>Jeremy Sisto is very hard guy to place! He is so familiar, and I had to look him out before I discovered he played the mum's boyfriend in Thirteen - duh, only like one of my favourite films!<p>Eliza Dushku is a great actress. She has a terrific screen prescence, and can certainly act her little socks off! She's lit up the screen before in True Lies and Bring It On, and hopefully will appear in lots more films.<p>There is NOT a lot of cast in this when you think about it, and most of them get killed off pretty quickly. Most of the girls are wandering around in too small tops, with peanuts stuffed down them by the looks of it! (They're called bras, wear them)<p>I tend to find from the start of these films, I know who's going to still be alive by the end of the movie. I was right with this one.<p>As shown during the deleted scenes, there's a deleted scene between Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku, which shows the attraction between them. This scene would have been better left in, as I was rooting for them to be together!<p>There are quite a few extras on this, although don't expect much, they're short and sweet just like me. The featurettes are pretty pointless, they're barely a couple of minutes of screen time. The extras include: an audio commentary by director Rob Schmidt and stars Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku; deleted scenes; four featurettes: &quot;Making of Wrong Turn,&quot; &quot;Eliza Dushku: Babe in the Woods,&quot; &quot;Stan Winston,&quot; &quot;Fresh Meat: The Wounds of Wrong Turn&quot; and a poster concept art gallery. (The latter is very dull). There's only four deleted scenes if I remember correctly, and most of the time, they are slight extensions of the original scenes. Pretty basic.<p>It's also a short and sweet movie, only 80 minutes. It's simple and straightforward, which means it doesn't take a lot of thought.<p>This is definitely a must have for any horror movie fans collection. Don't believe reviews that say it's rubbish. Even for someone who hates it, has to give it stars at least for Eliza Dushku (or Desmond Harrington, depending on which way inclined you are).</p></body></html>

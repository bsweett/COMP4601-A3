Kate Winslet's Oscar nominated performance is reason alone to watch this over-analytical comedy. Winslet is a fearless and unique actress, Jim Carrey and Mark Ruffalo are also good, I just wish Kristen Dunst wasn't in this, she's a one-trick pony! Eternal Sunshine... left me clouded and confused, pass this one up!</p></body></html>

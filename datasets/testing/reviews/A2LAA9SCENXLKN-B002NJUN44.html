<meta name="summary" content="Perfect for a Nerd"></head><body><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />So yes, this is pure popcorn entertainment. Now, let me get this the bad stuff off as quickly as possible. The idea of being able to hear your thoughts is a constantly used idea that makes no logical sense at all. Not because it's physically impossible, but because it's mentally impossible. Some thoughts aren't in the English language. What if your working on a math test? Keep in mind the brain uses thinking not just to talk undisturbed, but too also make sense of situations, solve problems, and understand both points of view of life. Meaning, that you will think what you think you don't want too think even though you don't really believe that. So the idea of having one read your mind, would make the greatest confusion of all time, AND SHOULD BE PARODIED BY MEL BROOKS IF HE IS STILL WORKING! But anyways, that's the one big problem I had with this movie.<br /><br />I'd say this is a good combination of Harry Potter, Godzilla and The Lightning Thief. Nothing is too deep, everything is completely fantasy and nothing at all hast to make sense. See the thing I love about this kind of movie, is that they're able to explain something that's completely illogical and make it sound completely logical. The actors, director and writer are able to immerse themselves in the impossible and understand just for the movie that it is possible. And that my friends! Is true genius. I cannot truly explain it. It is just an extremely fun time for nerds and geeks alike. Unless of course, your angry at what they cut from the book.<br /><br />Now, lettuce go back to a movie called Night of the Living Dead. What was it innovative for? Well, many things. It started the rating system, it's known as the great great godfather of modern horror. But, too a naive perspective, it is innovative for it's African-American lead actor. Now, lettuce think of any other dragon besides this one. King Ghidorah? Guy. Smaug? Guy. Pete's Dragon? Guy. Godzilla? Guy. Just about every single dragon you can think of was a guy. Now, now, think about that for a second. That's been ingrained into your brain through the society's stereotypes. Here, they blow the roof off society and bring in a female dragon into cinema. Now that my friends, is truly innovative.<br /><br />The CGI, I thought was impressive. I'm not gonna compare it too anything (and no coughs either,) because my brain might be fogged. But, I thought the CGI was very detailed and lifelike. Like, as if it was real material. I thought that was pretty impressive for a movie of this nature. Heck, being of this nature is impressive enough. So, in other words, I think this movie is extremely underrated. At least, from a non-book-reader's perspective. Well then...shall we give this movie a rating?<br /><br />The Rating? Well...I think it deserves a good 4/5</p></body></html>

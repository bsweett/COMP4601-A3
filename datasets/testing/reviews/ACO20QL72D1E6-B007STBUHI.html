Yup, they did make sequels and Deep Blue Sea; but it can never be like this....Thanks to the genius of Spielberg, Verna Fields and a GOOD screenplay by Garl Gootlieb and author Peter Bencheley this is both drama, horror and suspense on a high level. JAWS is indeed high art. Scheider, Gary, Duvall, Hamilton and Dreyfuss ALL excell in their roles.</p></body></html>

Samuel L.Jackson is awesome and I certainly can't wait to see him In S.H.I.E.L.D. Bruce Willis is a good actor,but this movie seemed like it was for fans of the terrible and Thank God Canceled Tv Show Heroes. So Implausible typical of M.Night(I did Like Signs). The end was a curve ball and that's good,but to get to this was at times boring and made you wonder what you were watching.</p></body></html>

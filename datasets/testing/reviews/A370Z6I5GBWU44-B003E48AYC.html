However, if you don't hold this to the standards of the book, it is a fairly enjoyable film on its own. The reason this story is so different is because Alice is supposed to be grown-up, having been to Wonderland before but having forgotten it.<br /><br />Some things in this movie are not explained well. I didn't like the Red Queen's head being so huge, it felt unneccessary to me. And the White Queen's physical demeanor, with her hands/arms constantly in the air was just weird. And I also didn't like Alice's actress. It's not that she was ugly, but she just didn't feel like an appropriate choice for the role, and this is one role (Mad hatter) that Johnny Depp simply failed to pull off. If you're a die-hard Alice in Wonderland fan, you might not like this. Considerable liberties have been taken from Lewis Carroll's original story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Sixth Sense's ugly stepsister..."></head><body><p>Say what you will about The Sixth Sense (one of my favorite movies), you can't deny: it set new standards for mystery/suspense films world wide. Any thriller on topic of ghosts or supernatural events or Schizophrenia or anything you'd find in a thriller (Even Untraceable, which was a good movie) would have AT LEAST a BIT of inspiration of The Sixth Sense. And lo and behold, the ugly stepsister from the same director: The Happening. OK, so, M. Night Shyamalan has directed TSS, Unbreakable, Signs (which I thought was OK but slightly disappointing), The Village (Awful movie), Lady in the Water, and now The Happening.<br /><br />Judging from what you see in the beginning of the movie, something strange is happening- a bunch of people commiting suicide in gruesome and depressing ways. The film evolves into a drama about a family being hit by the same situation. they get evacuated and board a train, and they find out that they have to walk to escape. They soon find out that a Toxin has been released, causing these people to kill themselves.<br /><br />OK, so, the storyline is interesting, yes. But then the whole "family drama" part is where the fil starts to take a downhill slide. None of us know much about these people, and they aren't developed enough. We can't see why we should respect these characters or hope they'll survive. It's just like any other disaster film.<br /><br />I may be a little generous to give it 3 stars but let me tell you why- You know M. Night Shyamalan tried. He stopped trying to create the most shocking twist ending, and he put forth a cool storyline. The death scenes are pretty cool- very gory and disturbing. The lawnmower scene is pretty gnarly, the arm ripping off scene is a big "WHOA" moment, and the "Hairpin" scene is what sets the disturbing bang for the movie.<br /><br />So if you can give this movie credit for what it tried, you may enjoy it. But truth is, this is The Sixth Sense's ugly stepsister, no doubt about it.</p></body></html>

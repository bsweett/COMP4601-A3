<meta name="summary" content="For Once,An Unattractive Prostitute In A Hollywood Movie!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is loosely based on the life story of Aileen Wournos, a serial killer who was executed a few years ago for her crimes. Aileen decides that since she can't get a legitimate job she has no choice but to be a prostitute. I think that Aileen should have taken a good hard look in the mirror before deciding on that career path. This movie tries to elicit sympathy for Aileen's plight but all I felt was very sorry for her victims. I seems that Aileen had yet to realize that you can't resolve a bad past by using violence in the present.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="all quiet on the eastern front"></head><body><p>the second part of clint eastwoods paean to the legendary ww2 battle came out to intense praise from critics last year, and while its a perfectly good war movie, im at a loss to understand where its supposed to be great.  is it that this tells the tale from the "enemy" point of view?  well, i can go back as far as "all quiet on the western front" at least for a similar concept.  yes, war is horrid and the enemy is not so very different from us: i have seen it before.  good battle sequences, good acting, good movie -- but a masterpiece?  no.</p></body></html>

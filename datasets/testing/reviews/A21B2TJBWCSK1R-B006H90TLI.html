<meta name="summary" content="A Return to Form for the Coen bros."></head><body><p>After two lackluster efforts - the bland romantic comedy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMET">Intolerable Cruelty (Widescreen Edition)</a> and the unnecessary remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029LNYQ">The Ladykillers (Widescreen Edition)</a> - the Coen brothers return to form with a vengeance with No Country for Old Men. Even though it is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy, the subject matter is very familiar territory for the Coens. The story revolves around a bag of money and the desperate quest by several men to acquire it and who are more than willing to kill for it. Sound familiar? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4P">Blood Simple (Director's Cut)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo (Special Edition)</a> and (rather humourously) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7DVR2">The Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a> are past Coen brothers films that feature a similar story so it is certainly material that they are drawn to and the results speak for themselves: critically-lauded and the recipient of numerous awards including four Academy Awards.<br /><br />Javier Bardem is chillingly effective as a sociopathic killer who sometimes lets his victims decide their fate with a coin toss. Like other cold-blooded killers in Coen brothers films (the Dane in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008RH3L">Miller's Crossing</a>, Charlie Meadows in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008RH3J">Barton Fink</a>, and Gaear Grimsrud in Fargo) Chigurh is an enigmatic unstoppable force of nature. In contrast, Sheriff Bell is the film's moral voice of reason and who better than Tommy Lee Jones with his kind, weathered face and equally weathered voice that instantly suggests years of life experience. He conveys the intelligence of his character by the way he works a crime scene, quickly deducing what happens through keen powers of observation much like Marge Gunderson in Fargo. Unlike Marge, however, Bell has seen better days and does not share her optimism. There is a tired sadness in his eyes that says so much about his character.<br /><br />Roger Deakins' superb cinematography perfectly captures the harsh, desolate West Texas landscape and how its vast expanse dwarfs the characters. They are at its mercy as much as they are with each other. The Coens have made a nihilistic thriller reminiscent of ones made in the 1970s.<br /><br />"The Making of No Country for Old Men" takes a look at how this film came together. Producer Scott Rudin brought the book to the Coens. They liked the cinematic possibilities and how it could be adapted into a genre film that subverts genre. This is a fairly standard featurette but everyone speaks eloquently about the film.<br /><br />"Working with the Coens" features the cast and crew speaking admiringly of working with the Coen brothers with a lot of their crew having worked with them for years.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Diary of a Country Sheriff" which takes a look at Sheriff Bell and how his character is a meditation on aging. He pursues Chigurh but does not understand him or what motivates his actions. The Coens and the cast talk about these two characters and their contrasting takes on life.</p></body></html>

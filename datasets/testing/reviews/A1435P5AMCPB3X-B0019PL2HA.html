The preview barely shows you only any of comedy this movie delivers.  It is wall to wall laughs.  From birth, Ricky Bobby, the man with two first names, was made for speed.  With a father who fashioned himself as a fast race, Little Ricky could only say four words, "I wanna go fast!". Then he meets his buddy, Cal Naughton JR, and an "Shake n Bake" was born.  Then by chance, the two of them end up on a pit crew for NASCAR where the driver decides to quit. The need a pinch driver, and Enter Ricky Bobby...who becomes a legend.  This movie is his Ballad.  NASCAR fans, there are cameos from some of the big names in the sport.  The racing action is awsome.  This was almost ok for the kids to see, but still had some adult humor.  Talladega nights is another great showing for Will Farrell and crew.</p></body></html>

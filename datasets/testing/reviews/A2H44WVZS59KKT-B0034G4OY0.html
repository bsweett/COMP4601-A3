The first part of the movie and large portions after that were in French.  I really didn't expect a subtitled movie (even though I use closed captioning).  A very "artsy" movie,not at all what I expected from a Clint Eastwood directed movie.  There was a foreign flavor to the whole thing.<br /><br />I guess I expected more of Matt Damon's character as the psychic, rather than little flowery vignettes randomly scattered over more than two hours.  The first part of the movie I enjoyed and I got my hopes up but then sheer ennui.</p></body></html>

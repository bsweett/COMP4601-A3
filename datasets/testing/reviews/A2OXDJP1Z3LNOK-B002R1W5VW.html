<meta name="summary" content="Boring.  Dull."></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage plays an obsessive-compulsive con-man in this extremely tedious film.  His life is turned upside down when he learns he has a daughter.  That makes him reassess his life and values.<p>That's all you need to know because this movie is as slow as it is uninteresting.  The daughter brings almost no energy to this plot and about 90 minutes passes before anything even remotely interesting happens.  I'm getting bored just trying to write about this dog of a film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cry Me A "River""></head><body><p>As pointed out by so many others "Mystic River" is a powerful, emotional, well acted, well written film directed by Client Eastwood ("Unforgiven", "Play Misty For Me"). Without question this is one of the year's best films. And what about the performance by Sean Penn! Of all the movies I've seen this year Penn delivers the best performance I've seen as actor give this year. Unless something really amazing comes out in the next month Penn better win the Oscar. Tim Robbins is right on target as well. He delivers an Oscar caliber performance. Other note worthy aspects of the film include the cinematography, the editing, and the adapted screenplay by Brian Helgeland based on Dennis Lehane's novel.<p> "Mystic River" tells the story of three young boys growing up in Boston. One day a traumatic event occurs leaving a permant emotional scar on one of the boys. Fast foward 30 years later now yet another terrible event occurs. The death of one of their daughters, bringing the demons of the past up front again as they now deal with new demons. And who knows what's the come in the future. All of these characters seemed scarred for life. There is a bleak feeling one gets by the end of the movie.<p> The childhood friends grow up to become Sean Penn (Jimmy Markum), the one who loses his daughter. Tim Robbins (Dave Boyle) and Kevin Bacon (Sean Divine) who has become a cop and is assigned to the case. As I said before there is wonderful acting here. The three men turn in fine performances by almost everytime Penn was onscreen I had goosebumps. Now, I don't say that just to offer idle praise. I'm being sincere. Penn shows a very wide range of emotions in this movie.<p> One of the only faults I have with this movie is it seems to be the men's movie all the way. You have two very talented actresses in Marica Gay Harden and Laura Linney and they are not used properly. I admit more time is given to Harden but they seemed to have forgotten Linney. Now naturally I can't speak for everyone but I thought Linney was great in "You Can Count On Me". I find her to be an extremely talented person. But she has just about nothing in this movie. Her only really good scene where she has more than two lines is at the end of the picture! I just wish they could have given her a better role. Other than that I've no complants.<p> Also spot Eli Wallach, Eastwood's old buddy in "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" in a delightful cameo.<p> Bottom-line: An emotional powerhouse of a film. Great acting, good script and fine directing by Eastwood. Truly one of the year's best films.</p></body></html>

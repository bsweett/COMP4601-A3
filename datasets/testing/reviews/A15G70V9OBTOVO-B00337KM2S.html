As that ridiculously stereotyped young lady explains how being fired is just a step towards new horizons.  On the minus, there seemed to be a morality tale, as if Clooney was somehow being punished in his private life as comeuppance for what he did for a living.<br /><br />There is some clever dialog but even here its giving with one hand while taking with the other.  The subtext is that if you're clever and articulate enough you can convince people that the loss of a job, while serious, is likely to be an opportunity.  And frankly, the alternative to Clooney's lifestyle, the young midwestern couple getting married, didn't look all that appealing, either.<br /><br />No doubt this movie will resonate with a small number of people who ended up better off as the result of a layoff and those are the stories everyone likes to hear.  I worked for a company where everyone lost their job so I have some idea of the probabilities.  But its ironic, don't you think, that if people like Ryan Bingham actually exist, on the one hand, a company could be desperately trying to save money by firing staff while on the other, cover the cost of flying somebody all over the country to do what their own personnel department should do?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Remake"></head><body><p>While most remakes fall flat for either being too different or just ripping off the original, this one is unique in that is different enough to be its own. Steve Martin does an excellent job, admirably taking over for the great Peter Sellers. The accent is his own and is very different from Sellers. Though I do like some of the references to the older films like Clouseau and the globe and the trouble his accent can get him into. Instead of manserveant Cato (we live in PC times, though Jackie Chan was considered), we get fellow lawman Ponton, played by Jean Reno, who is a good substitute character. Beyonce is also very good in this, proving, like Queen Latifah, that SOME singers can act. The only character who doesn't get any justice is Chief Inspector Dreyfuss. Though Kevin Kline does a fine job in the role, they've heavily changed how the character was. Instead of going increasingly insane and wanting to kill Clouseau with a passion, all this version does is try and show him up and humiliate him. Though seeing as how this and its sequel are marketed more towards kids than the originals (though plenty of innuendo abound in both), today's parents might find Dreyfuss' deteriorating mental state a little disturbing for their kids. The gags are quite funny, though Clouseau inspecting the room for spies gets and the fart joke is tedious (aren't they all). Christophe Beck does quite well with Mancini's classic theme though I do think its a little over used. While Mancini mainly used it during suspense scenes, Beck seems to use it whenever he pleases.</p></body></html>

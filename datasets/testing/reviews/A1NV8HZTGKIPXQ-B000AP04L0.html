It's one of those movies. Mike Judge(King Of The Hill), wrote and directed this hilarious look at the mundane life of office workers. Peter(Ron Livingston) has a boring life. He lives in a plain, by the numbers apartment with an odd neighbor(Diedrich Bader from "The Drew Carey Show"), and works in front of a computer all day in a small cubicle. It's the same rut day in and day out. He has a smarmy boss with an very slow, annoying way of speech named Bill Lumberg(Played by the awesome Gary Cole). This guy is pricelessly funny. Many points go to Mr. Cole. He also, in a very funny joke, has a friend that works there named Michael Bolton. Don't think there's not many jokes there!. The company then begins to downsize and Peter's two best friends are on that list, while he is to be promoted. The three guys then set out for revenge and devise a plan to launder funds from company accounts. All seems to be golden, when something goes horribly wrong and the guys scramble to find a solution to save their butts!. Jennifer Aniston also co-stars(and looking cute as ever) as Peter's waitress girlfriend. Stephen Root from "NewsRadio" co-stars as Milton, a highly geeky loser who never gets the attention or respect at work. Like Cole, his comedic performance is incredibly funny. The ending kinda just happens real quickly, and one wishes it was a bit longer and more fleshed out. We've come this far!. The movie has many laugh out loud moments that are both hysterical and oh so true!. Who doesn't hate their job, right?. The film hits the bullseye on that front. It's a shame this intelligent film didn't get the recognition it deserved. It is definitley finding a voice on cable and video. Good. If your looking for a fun little movie that you may of missed, this is the movie for you!. As Bill Lumberg himself might say, ' I want you to see this movie, m'kaaaayyy?. Riiiggghhhttt. Teriffic'. Well said Bill.</p></body></html>

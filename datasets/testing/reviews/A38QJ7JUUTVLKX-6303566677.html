He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. The Terminator robots are pretty cool looking, and the fact that this film causes you to think. Yes there are alot of explosions and a sex scene, but this film doesn't insult your intelligence. If you're going to buy this, get the MUCH BETTER sequel Terminator II: Judgement Day.</p></body></html>

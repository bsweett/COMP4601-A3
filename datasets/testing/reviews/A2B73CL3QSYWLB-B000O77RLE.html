<meta name="summary" content="Searing Account From the Japanese Perspective"></head><body><p>To say that "Letters From Iwo Jima" is a great war film does it an injustice.  I found the film to be more of a tribute to humanity than a war picture.  It must have taken director Clint Eastwood a lot of courage, growing up under the specter of war, to make a film that humanizes the other side.  What Eastwood concerns himself here is the effects that the American assault on Iwo Jima had on the collective psyche of the Japanese fighting men.  These are men who were indoctrinated in a system that taught them the invincibility of Japan who under fire are finding their original assumptions eviscerated.  These are not the cliched Banzai shouting samurai sword wielding cartoon characters in the films of old.  These are bakers, shopkeepers, laborers, etc. who find themselves defending "sacred" Japanese soil while the powers-that-be divert prescious resources elsewhere.  There are any number of scenes here that will break your heart.  I approached this film with trepidition because I wasn't a big fan of Eastwood's other Iwo Jima epic, "Flags of our Fathers".  This film is infinitely better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Long Live The King"></head><body><p>Bruce Campbell stars as a retirement-home bound Elvis Presley in writer-director Don Coscarelli's (The "Phantasm" series) zany horror/comedy "Bubba Ho-Tep." If the names Coscarelli and/or Campbell mean anything to you, you're in for a guaranteed good time.<br /><br />While The King can only lay in bed and lament over his mistakes and how life has effectively passed him by, the decrepit retirement community he begrudgingly calls home comes under attack by a soul-sucking mummy with a fondness for brown eyes. Together with an equally delusional and crusty resident in the form of John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis), Elvis drags himself out of bed to hunt the titular character. It's a last-ditch effort at redemption and besides, he doesn't have anything better to do anyway.<br /><br />Campbell is given his best role since playing Ash in the "Evil Dead" series, and he eats up every bit of it. His take on Elvis Presley is every bit as hilarious as it is bitter. One minute he's spitting one-liners at his care-givers, the next moment he's grumbling about an unfortunate growth on his undercarriage. Though the film offers Campbell many silly scenarios to wade through, he still manages to make the send-up seem somewhat serious and heartfelt. He's less a parody of Elvis than he is a vague approximation of what the man may have been like had he been given the chance to grow old and lose his marbles.<br /><br />Meanwhile, thanks to a steady hand by the ever-reliable Don Coscarelli, the film never sags or gets soggy. All the hallmarks of a Coscarelli film are there -- the nutty, nightmarish images, the unrelenting goofball humor -- making for a delightful cocktail that is one part parody and one part horror with a dash of drama thrown into the mix. Coscarelli balances all of this with ease and delivers a film that moves as slickly as its cinematography. This is truly the director on top of his game.<br /><br />All in all, "Bubba Ho-Tep" is a deliciously fun piece of fantasy that doesn't ask much of its audience. Though it touches lightly upon themes of aging and the way we treat our elders, the film's main purpose is to entertain and to that end, it's a smashing success. Sure, if one were to inspect it closely enough, they'd find a few surface flaws, but where's the fun in that? What a shame Campbell and Coscarelli couldn't make a sequel work, as more films in this vein are the breath of fresh air indie film-making and the horror genre in general could use right now. Truly a film worthy of its cult status.</p></body></html>

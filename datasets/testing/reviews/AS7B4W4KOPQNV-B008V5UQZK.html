This film was about a woman, Toula, who grew up in a very Greek family.  Toula's father is always pressuring her to get married to a Greek and he tells her that she looks old all the time.  Later on, Toula gets a make-over and a good job, which lands her a great boyfriend, Ian.  However, Ian is not Greek, which causes many problems for Toula at home.  I found this movie to be hilarious, and it was so funny how the father always sprayed windex on things, thinking it could cure anything.  You should go see it if you haven't already.</p></body></html>

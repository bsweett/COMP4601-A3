<meta name="summary" content="Matchstick Men  (2003)"></head><body><p>Director:  Ridley Scott<br />Cast:  Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell, Alison Lohman, Bruce Altman, Bruce McGill, Jenny O'Hara, Steve Eastin.<br />Running Time:  121 minutes.<br />Rated PG-13 for language and some violence.<p>Ridley Scott, director of a wide variety of motion pictures, ranging from "Alien", "Blade Runner", "Thelma and Louise", and the Oscar-winning "Gladiator", creates an exciting, intelligent action-comedy that possesses a strong lead wrong from the obsessive-compulsive stricken con-artist played by Nicholas Cage.  Adapted from the novel written by Eric Garcia, "Matchstick Men" is a hidden gem that did not receive much critical consideration or buzz, but will undoubtedly make you laugh and think at the same time.<p>Roy (Cage) is a virtuoso con-man who is overwhelmed by his psychological disadvantages that consist of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder; he is very monetarily successful, but his problems have left him with no social acquaintances except his partner Frank (played by Sam Rockwell), a devastating divorce, and an increasing dependence on his psychologist (Bruce Altman).  Amidst planning for their biggest score against a wealthy, unsuspecting mark (Bruce McGill), Roy's world is thrown upside down when a young fourteen year-old girl (Alison Lohman) steps through the threshold of his frantic world and claims to be the daughter that he has never met.  Roy is torn between making the biggest score of his live or changing his ways and perspectives to focus more on his newfound relationship with the young woman.  Surprisingly to Roy, his daughter has an incredible knack for the dubious crimes that he and Frank are accustomed to committing-prompting Roy to include her in their con scheme.<p>Director Scott creates a hip, energetic film with similar undertones to his 1991 film "Thelma and Louise", using some excellent dialogue and twists and turns to create an intellectual comedic caper that sniffs similarities of "The Sting".  Nicholas Cage is very good in his role as the neurotic crook, but his engaging relationship with the stand-out Lohman makes the film very entertaining.  A film that will certainly stimulate the mind and the funny bone-well worth the trip.  The 72-minute "Tricks of the Trade" is produced by Ridley Scott and is a very informative and interactive feature on the DVD, allowing viewers to parade through a variety of options, including interview segments, deleted scenes and ego-massaging.  An especially pleasurable flick!</p></body></html>

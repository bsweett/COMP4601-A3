<meta name="summary" content="Rather Well Done Introduction to the Character"></head><body><p>This is the story of how Wolverine came into existence starting with his childhood and the discovery of his mutant powers. It tracks him and his brother, also a mutant, who share many adventures over an extended period of time and develops the basic difference between the two brothers.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman plays the part of the character who will become Wolverine with a balance of aggression and compassion. The story carries the Wolverine character from childhood to the point of introducing Professor Charles Xavier and the hope of sanctuary for the mutants.<br /><br />This is first and foremost an action adventure that should please fans of the X-Men series. The sound and picture are excellent with plenty of surround sound to immerse the viewer in the action.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the X-Men movies it is very likely you will enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not sure who will like this flick"></head><body><p>Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch star in this misfire attempt to film the graphic novel "Ghost World".  I'm not sure who this flick will disappoint more - those who've read the original and will nitpick over the differences, or those who have no familiarity with Daniel Clowes's offbeat characters, and may have no other reason to bond with the characters.  Like the original the movie tells of the what may be the end of a great friendship - the final summer for Enid and Rebecca.  With high school over, their ideas of the future (vague at first, but soon to reveal themselves as painfully distinct) may tear them apart.  Enid and Rebecca aren't so much as friends as two girls of similar age who loathe themselves and the entire world, but strangely not each other.  In their minds, the world is surrounded by freaks and fakes about whom they pursue, joke and otherwise exploit ruthlessly.  <p>The film gets the graphic novel's surface gloss right - John Ellis, Josh, the creeps who hang out at the "Zine-o-Phobia", the Satanists, Melorra, Enid's lame father, that "Weird Al" looking waiter (not played by "Weird Al" though) and that pair of pants that nobody ever picks off the street.  Now, Enid must take summer art classes to get her HS diploma.  A gifted cartoonist in the Daniel Clowes vein, Enid must nevertheless pass muster with a dippy art school teacher (Ileanna Douglas) and her PC students.  More significantly, the flick bravely tries splitting the friendship between Rebecca and Enid who finds herself drawn to another.  While the original Enid had desires, the flick gives her the chance for a real relationship.  In the book, Enid and Rebecca cruelly prank an older guy with a faked personal ad.  While the graphic novel victim dissappears in a cloud of anger, the flick hangs onto him - turning him into a luckless, feckless misanthrope with a name to match: Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Curious at first, Enid gets closer to Seymour determined to help guide the guy to a real relationship, one apart from the losers who share his love of old 78 records.  Determined to use her powers for good and not evil, Enid becomes determined get Seymour snagged.  Unfortunately, when efforts prove successful, and Seymour improbably snags the woman of his dreams, Enid begins to realize her own feelings for Seymour.  Unsure of what she wants, Enid's mixed-up life begins to strain her relationship with Rebecca (with whom she's apartment hunting) and her art classes (which she must take to graduate HS).  <p>"Ghost" the graphic novel was an enigma, a grab bag of mixed-up tricks and treats.  The flick seems impenetrable, unfortunately to the guys who wrote it, and it's not as sucessful at turning the original's episodic storyline into a coherent narartive.  Seymour's painfully underwritten, especially given Buscemi's normal gift for banter - and nothing explains why Enid's attracted to him.  He ofcourse finds her beautiful, which is a problem - Enid wasn't supposed to be beautiful.  Not to be true to the original for the sake of authenticity, but Thora Birch is simply too radiant (if malevolently so) and youthful to play the self-loathing Enid.  Enid's secret desire is to suddenly become someone else and leave home forever.  In the novel, that works, but it doesn't seem to go with the rest of the movie, making the final shot (or panel) look forced - what is she supposed to be running from.  The flick also suffers the loss of Bob Skeetes, a mysterious seer whose few appearances in the story are more than compensated by the presence he casts over Enid's world.<p>IN SUM: If you never read GW, you'll probably spend most of your time just scratiching your head.  If you loved GW so much that you'll do anything to see Thora Birch say "Joey McCobb, he's our god!!" this is your flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outrageously bad...Seth Rogen is a one trick pony and can't act worth a damn"></head><body><p>The worst piece of crap I've seen in a long time. Gondry makes great videos but here he looks like any other Hollywood flash director. The acting is flat out bad, but that's mainly the fault of the script, penned by the worst actor of them all here, Rogen. And that's quite a feat.<br /><br />How did this guy get this job? He can NOT act. He has ONE character. He's in almost every movie made lately, and every single cartoon it seems, and he plays the same guy in all of them, as here. Except that guy has NOTHING to do with Britt Reid! Rogen and his erstwhile writing partner in crime (and this movie truly is criminally bad) Goldberg penned one of the worst scripts ever here, trolling for cheap pointless laughs at every turn while trying to fashion a simultaneous bromance/action thriller, and failing miserably in every way.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz seems to be just laughing at how bad this is, as one imagines the whole cast was throughout the filming. It's embarrassing to watch, especially while realizing you paid money to rent it.<br /><br />All in all, a complete piece of trash redeemed only mildly by Chou and Waltz, who both somehow managed to be mildly entertaining amidst all of this self-congratulatory dreck ("Look Ma! They let me make a superhero movie!").<br /><br />I wouldn't watch this again if you paid me a hundred bucks. Seriously.</p></body></html>

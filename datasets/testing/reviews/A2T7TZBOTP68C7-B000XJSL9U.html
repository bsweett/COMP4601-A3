Because of the overblown trailers, I feared the movie would contain only explosions and car crashes, with no plot.  Thankfully, this movie is well done, with a good story, good enough acting, fantastic lighting, and good sets.  And how refreshing to see a movie not reliant on computer-generated special effects.  This film is a testosterone feast a la 300.  Highly recommended for old school action movie buffs.  This is a classic.<br /><br />Through the whole movie, one thing drove me crazy.  For the life of me, I could not recall where I had seen the actor who played the young hacker.  He looked so familiar.  My husband came down to watch the last part with me.  He pointed the actor out as the Mac in the Mac & PC ads!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Trying to recapture the fun of comic book"></head><body><p>While "Four" wasn't exactly "Fantastic" it was an entertaining diversion. I really wanted to like "Fantastic Four". I grew up reading the comic book as a kid and enjoyed Jack Kirby's unique artwork and Stan Lee's campy scripts. The film directed by Tim Story tries to recapture the essence of "Fantastic Four" and although it doesn't quite measure up to expectations, Story does a better job than I expected. Although "Fantastic Four" isn't a classic on the par of "X-2", "Spider-Man 2" or "Batman Begins", it doesn't pretend to be. "Fantastic Four" tries to recapture what made "Spider-Man" so successful with its mix of comedy, drama and superheroics. It's an enjoyable romp that is as disposable as "Daredevil" was. Avoiding the camp of truly bad comic book inspired movies like "Batman & Robin", "Fantastic Four" works best when the screen is given over to the conflict between Johnny Storm ("The Human Torch") and Ben Grimm ("The Thing"). Their bickering recalls the formula that worked so well in the comics during their heyday.<br /><br />When NASA turns down his proposal for an experiment in space scientist Reed Richards approachs classmate/ scientist/venture capitalist Victor Von Doom to finance it. Richards wants to go up to Doom's privately funded space station to test the effects of a cosmic storm on living plants. Richards believes that this cosmic storm may have contributed to life evolving on Earth and wants to see what properties the storm has on DNA. Unfortunately, things go wrong when the storm approaches the space station hours ahead of schedule exposing Richards, his friend astronatu Ben Grimm, pilot Johnny Storm, his sister Sue Storm and Von Doom to the effects of the storm.<br /><br />The storm changes them all in ways they could never imagine: Richards becomes elastic able to stretch into any shape; Grimm literally is turned into a superhuman monster with huge rock like scales that protect him and with unnatural strength; Johnny can change into a pillar of fire that can fly; Sue has the ability to generate force fields and turn invisible. This motley crew of dynsfunctional bickering superheroes join forces to become the Fantastic Four. They must face Von Doom who has mutated a form of organic metal that's able to control electricity.<br /><br />While the film quickly jumps right into the action, it does take a while for the plot to move along to the conflict between Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four. Ioan Gruffudd's Richards needed to be better developed as a character and Jessica Biel just wasn't up to the task of playing the underwritten role of Sue Storm. Still, Story manages to come up with a number of strong set pieces making the film memorable if not an outright classic like "Spider-Man" or "Batman Begins". The humor of the film takes center stage quite often and it does work to the film's advantage. The best visual effects sequeneces are pretty much put on display in the trailer and the CGI seems a bit unfinished at times (such as some of Richards' stretching scenes much as the early CGI Spidey sequences weren't completely convincing in "Spider-Man" but there the script and performances were so good you could forgive the shortcomings of the visual effects)where the textures look far too cartoony to be completely convincing. The scenes with The Torch look much more convincing. It's evident that much was cut from the film and it appears choppy at times. If this had been released at the same time as "Spider-Man" (or shortly before), it would have been seen as a much more important movie. Following so closely in the wake of "Batman Begins" and Spielberg's "War of the Worlds", "Fantastic Four" lacks the truly commanding scope or character development that were so critical to those films. The script credited to Mark Frost (co-creator/writer/producer of "Twin Peaks" and Michael France (writer on Ang Lee's "The Hulk" and tepid "The Punisher") runs, pardon the pun, hot and cold. The casting seems dead on (with a few notable exceptions). Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon are perfectly cast (although without enough to do). Gruffudd seems right for the part but, again, character development would have helped his role a bit more.<br /><br />If the film does well at the box office expect a sequel. The good news that, perhaps, they'll bring in a strong writer and perhaps deal with the Galactus/Silver Surfer story line that was so memorable in the 60's. Give the next film to someone with an edgier take on the story, focus on character development a bit more and have a narrative that has the slam-bang action approach of "X-2". One of the difficulties with a feature like this is the fact that there are so many characters that need screen time. It can be a challenge to balance that with the action.</p></body></html>

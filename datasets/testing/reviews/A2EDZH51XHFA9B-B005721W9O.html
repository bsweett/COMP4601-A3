I got spoiled by having empty theaters for the last few movies I went to. I haven't seen a theatre this full since Sleepy Hollow. At least the subject  matter was more appropriate this time. <p><p>Despite the presence of some  serious starpower, this had the potential to be a truly awful movie.  Thankfully, it managed to avoid that, although it took the easy way out.  The cast of an old TV show called Galaxy Quest are making their living  showing up at conventions. (Sound familiar?) They are approached by a band  of real aliens, who think that the reruns are actually documentaries, who  ask them to save their planet from the evil lizard-bird-alien-thing Saris.  The commander (Tim Allen), who thinks they're asking him to do a faked  appearance, goes along and discovers himself actually out in space, in a  real replica of the Galaxy Quest ship. He lures the others (including an  extra who was killed five minutes into his episode-- sound familiar?) into  helping him battle Saris. With, of course, the expected results. <p><p>This  could have also degenerated into simple parody. And it's good enough simple  parody of the first few crossover Star Trek films (while Tim Allen's  character is obviously modeled on Jim Kirk, Alan Rickman seems to be an odd  cross of Spock and Picard-- early on, he mumbles to himself, &quot;Why am I  doing this? I played Richard III!&quot;), with more than enough laughs to  stand, but what turns this puerile silliness into truly biting satire is  the second level of parody; if you see Star Trek itself as a self-parody,  something that was meant to be cheesy, then you can see a lot of Galaxy  Quest as parody within parody. The miners (you've seen the trailers, right?  The ones Sigourney Weaver says &quot;look like little children&quot;) bear  a more-than-passing resemblance to Teletubbies, carrying on the Star Trek  tradition of pop-culture cannibalism; jokes are made about Tim Allen's  character sleeping with everything that moves; etc. <p><p>All is well and  good with the last hour of this film. It's funny, smart (well, okay, in a  stupid way), well-acted, and cheesy as all get-out. It's the first twenty  minutes that I couldn't get my head around. The slowest of slow starts,  which usually spells death for a comedy; the strength of the movie's  remaining time is all that saves it. The cast are capable. The script is  stupid, but it's supposed to be (and intent is everything). Sigourney  Weaver still looks fabulous with half her clothing ripped off. <p><p>The  tagline is &quot;never give up; never surrender.&quot; I wish they'd  circumvented it long enough to give up the first twenty minutes of this  movie. ** 1/2</p></body></html>

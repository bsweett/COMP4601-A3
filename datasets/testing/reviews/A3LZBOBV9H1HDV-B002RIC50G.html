The cast led by Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal Lecter and Gong Li as Lady Murasaki Shikibu, is great. The directing by Peter Webber (who also directed "Girl With A Pearl Earring" (2003) is excellent! The screenplay by Thomas Harris (based on his novel of the same title and the creator of the Hannibal Lecter books) is excellent! The music by Ilan Eshkeri & Shigeru Umebayashi (who also did the music to "Jet Li's Fearless" (2006) is excellent! The cinematography by Ben Davis is excellent. The film editing by Valerio Bonelli & Pietro Scalia (who won two Oscars for his work on "JFK" (1991) and "Black Hawk Down" (2001), which was directed by Ridley Scott, who also directed "Hannibal" (2001), one of the movies of the Hannibal Lecter franchise, which Scalia also edited, also did the film editing to "Memoirs Of A Geisha" (2005), which also starred Gong Li) is excellent. The casting by Leo Davis (who also did the casting to "The Queen" (2006) is excellent. The production design by Allan Starski (who won the Oscar for his work on "Schindler's List" (1993) and also did the production design to "The Pianist" (2002) is excellent. The set decoration by Judy Farr & Karel Van&aacute;sek (who also did the set decoration to "Hostel" (2006) is excellent. The costume design by Anna B. Sheppard (who was nominated for Oscars for her work on "Schindler's List"  & "The Pianist") is excellent. A great beginning inside the mind of one of Hollywood's most cinematic villains of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Demented and Original"></head><body><p>At a time when many movies are utter crap, this one stood out for its originality. A hapless puppeteer discovers a 'portal' into the brain of John Malkovich and this device becomes the pivot for weird takes on couplehood, not to mention celebrity.<br />This is a small movie. No one gets shot. No blood. No car crashes. No nudity. In other words, it's a miracle this thing was sort of a minor hit. Great rental movie.</p></body></html>

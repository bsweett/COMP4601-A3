<meta name="summary" content="Bubba Ho-Hum."></head><body><p>With a plotline and cast like this, this one should have been B- movie nirvana.  Unfortunately it is not.  Those seeking the kind of humor/thrills/horror that BRUCE CAMPBELL gave in the EVIL DEAD series will be dissapointed at how BUBBA HO-TEP plays out.  CAMPBELL is, of course, the best thing about this flick playing a retired, over the hill ELVIS who battles an egyptian mummy that is hell bent on sucking the souls out of the rest home resident community where the king is cooling his heels.  Unbelieveably, with all that going on and a short running time (about 85 minutes), the film moves very slowly and is quite boring in parts.  The direction by PHANTASM lenser DON COSCARELLI is choppy and uneven, leaving the story on a whole not that funny, nor scary or thrilling.  The redeemer is CAMPBELL, whose ability to make ELVIS revered whilst scummy is great.  You can tell he's having a blast, playing a sarcastic, yet honest tribute.  CAMPBELL is one of those actors that is just fun to watch, and only in this kind of kooky movie.  Fans of CAMPBELL should enjoy at least one viewing, for BUBBA HO-TEP isn't bad B-movie entertainment, it just isn't that good either.</p></body></html>

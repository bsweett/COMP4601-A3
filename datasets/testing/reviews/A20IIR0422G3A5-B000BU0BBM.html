<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing outing for both Gilliam and Damon"></head><body><p>`The Brothers Grimm' directed by the important fantasy / satire director, Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame is a disappointing movie on several counts.<br /><br />First and foremost is the promise of another Gilliam movie comparable to `The 12 Monkeys', `Brazil', or even `Time Bandits'. Gilliam has had his share of flops, but overall his reputation for quirkily entertaining movies is good enough to look forward to a new effort from the director of `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and other Python movies. As it turns out, we discover in Gilliam's opening statements in his voice-over commentary, he didn't even like the script when it was first offered to him to direct.<br /><br />The second count is that Peter Jackson (`Lord of the Rings') and the Harry Potter directors have raised the bar on expectations from the quality of human and plot aspects of fantasy movies. You can't get away anymore with great special effects anymore. Jackson gets more `human interest' out of his principle ent character, Treebeard than Gilliam gets out of his whole cast, not to mention the great characterization he gets from a CGI character, Gollum.<br /><br />The third count is that the movie simply doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie or a comedy or a drama? While `Time Bandits' is largely played for laughs and `Brazil' is clearly a tragedy with some funny scenes (especially Robert DeNiro's cameo appearance scene), I simply don't know what the authors are expecting from me in this movie.<br /><br />The fourth count is a lack of depth in the characterizations and story we have what I suspect is a really weak performance from Matt Damon and not much more from Heath Ledger. Some of this may be due to the way his shots were blocked and shot, but I do get the feeling that Damon in this movie is not the Matt Damon of `Good Will Hunting' or even the Bourne movies. Then again, maybe he was simply horribly miscast, as he did so well in those other three outings. Peter Stormare as the French torturer virtually steals the show from Damon and Ledger. Gilliam regular Jonathan Pryce does well in his small role, but is not enough to raise the overall level of human acting. The overriding impression I get from Gilliam's voice-over commentary is that he spends all his time talking about how locations were used and scenery and costumes were set up. Compare this to the commentary for a great movie of characters such as Renoir's `The Rules of the Game' and you can see how little humanity there is to be found in this movie.<br /><br />The fifth count is that Gilliam and the author have dreadfully misused their underlying text, the fairy tales of the 19th century folklorists whose names are given to the two lead characters in this movie. I can imagine a movie based on exactly the same material done in an entirely different way which would have been much warmer and made much better use of their audience's memories of the fairy tales.<br /><br />One of the easiest ways to appreciate how badly this movie fails would be to compare it to a movie based on a similar premise, `Ghostbusters' with similar reliance on special effects to move the story along. While both stories involve teams of con artists facing a real supernatural danger, with their feet being held to the fire by a strong government agency, `Ghostbusters' comes off as a triumph of both comedy and victory of good over evil while `The Brothers Grimm' simply plays out our expectations. One of the many symptoms of how one movie succeeds while the other fails is the fact that up to the last scene, `Ghostbusters' was pulling unexpected rabbits out of its hat while `Grimm' was just playing out its tired story. Just imagine what `The Brothers Grimm' would have been like with Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd in the lead roles!<br /><br />My biggest puzzle with this movie is why Gilliam decided to do it if he didn't like the script. I would have thought it would have had all the markings of an earlier failure on the Baron Munchausen movie. This movie will not even make anyone's top ten list of fantasy movies.<br /><br />Even with the Gilliam voice-over commentary, this DVD is not worth buying.</p></body></html>

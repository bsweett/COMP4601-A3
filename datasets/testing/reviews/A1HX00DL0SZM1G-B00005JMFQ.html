And even though we all thought that the movie (which traces the seemingly separate love stories of several couples - and some love triangles) didn't quite gel together we all agreed that it was a true "feel good" picture and overall an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.<br /><br />With a simply incredible cast that toplines a number of the major British actors (Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley) the movie does occasionally seem unwieldy and top heavy. But the most common effect throughout the group of us who sat through it last week was smiles as the simple charm of the picture wins you over.<br /><br />This is a hard picture to give a brief synopsis of the plot for. There is so much going on and a lot of which appears unrelated that all one can say is the film tries to convince us that love is everywhere. We have a newly elected single British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant). An author taking a working holiday in France (Colin Firth). A young bride (Keira Knightley) whose best man comes to realize he also loves (who can blame him) and a young boy who loves an American girl who is returning to the USA and a number of other stories. Stories that all come to a satisfying conclusion by the time the end credits roll.<br /><br />Another notable highlight of the movie is the soundtrack and as our group tried to figure out what the connection was between all people in this movie we all decided that regardless of how well it turned out - the soundtrack was a winner. With its selection of favorites one of the group exclaimed `I think this movie has all my favorite in it.'<br /><br />So, if you feel like getting into one of the best `feel good' movies of the past year (or any year) or simply want to watch an all-star cast at the top of their game then `Love Actually' needs to be on your list. It's a good reminder that entertainment comes in many different forms  - just like love.</p></body></html>

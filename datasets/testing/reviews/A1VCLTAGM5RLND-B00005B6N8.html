<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Performances"></head><body><p>Considering that this was a low-budget film, shot in the Australian outback...they did a hell of a good job. Although the script was weak, Radha Mitchell pulled off an excellent performance. I believe that all of the actors in this film should be commended for turning what should have been a total bomb into an entertaining, action-packed joy ride. Vin Diesel was also very convincing as Riddick. He too pulled off a marvelous performance. The action was spine tingling and edged-of-your-seat stuff.</p></body></html>

His intention was to mirror the elusive and hypnotic atmosphere that featured L.A. in the forties. Of course, films such as Set up, Nightmare Alley, Sunset Boulevard or Murder my sweet had approached some of the different issues dealt in this film,, corruption, easy money goal, sphere of influences and above all lack of self esteem for the sake of figure as a simple extra, or on the contrary to occupy a prominent status in the show business. But the corruption in the police departament and the way some people made easy money through ilicit movements made me remind the central nerve of Chinatown.<br /><br />Maybe the lack of a narrative pulse or the excessive preciosity by this renowned director made the dramatic spinal column would suffer of sclerosis too soon.<br /><br />Josh Harnett and Hillary Swank made top notch performances.</p></body></html>

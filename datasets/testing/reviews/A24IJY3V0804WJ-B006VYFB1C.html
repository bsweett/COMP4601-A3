<meta name="summary" content="A team of misfit dolls"></head><body><p>Sabermetrics is at the soul of this film, which has been adapted from Michael Lewis's book based on Oakland Athletics's remarkable 2002 season. The story begins with the bolting of three free agents. The dilemma for Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt) as the GM is how to compete with a team with a payroll like the New York Yankees. Guided by the ideas of Sabermetrics and a young assistant Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill) they come up with a list of players who are affordable but have been given a chance because of negative perceptions about them. This approach shakes up the team and upsets the scouts and the manager Art Howe ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Director Benett Miller takes us through the season all the way to their history making victory streak. This may sound like a documentary but the director and the screen writer have looked for stories within the team such as the arrogance of David Justice, the lack of interest in the game by Jeremy Giambi and the reluctant but ultimate hero Scott Hatteberg. It is however Billy Beane and his assistant Charles Brand who walk away with the accolades as their performance is amazing, understated and amazing. Money Ball is worth a look at  the game you thought you knew so much about but know so little. One of the best films of 2011. five stars. 2/23/2012</p></body></html>

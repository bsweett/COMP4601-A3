<meta name="summary" content="Predictable and not-very-thrilling "thriller""></head><body><p>For the first 45 minutes this was one of the dullest "thrillers" I had ever seen. The rest of it was one of the more cliche-ridden ones you'll ever watch. Clive Owen is an advertising exec who's marriage is rocky and has a daughter with diabetes. One morning on the train he meets Jennifer Aniston and they strike up a conversation which leads to flirting which leads to an attempted affair. Something very bad happens at the hotel they go to and the rest of the movie is Clive Owen being blackmailed and trying to keep his secret from his wife and also protect Aniston.<br /><br />The twists in this movie aren't hard to see coming and will surprise no one. The ending is unbelievable and wraps things up too neatly. The movie has a good cast, and is a nice looking film but it takes too long for anything to happen and then when it does, it's predictable.</p></body></html>

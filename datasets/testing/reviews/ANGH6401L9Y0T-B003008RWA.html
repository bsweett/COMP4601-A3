<meta name="summary" content="Michael Moore Tackles the Health Care Mess"></head><body><p>This was my first experience with Michael Moore's reporting/humor. But it's not my last: in the same order, I also got "Fahrenheit 9/11," "Bowling for Columbine," and "Roger & Me." He makes some vitally important points in this film, and blew away most of the arguments against government-paid health care that I have heard (and, I will admit, perpetuated) over my years as a Libertarian.<br /><br />Most of America agrees that food, clothing and shelter are necessities, and that if someone cannot provide them for themselves, it is simply humane and civilized that we pay for them with taxes. For most of us, the same is true of health care. Sure, we know there are abuses, but it's better to help one or two or even ten who might be able to help themselves, but are simply unwilling. Our alternative is to let those who really cannot meet these basic needs for themselves suffer needlessly. But that puts a huge gap between the poor who are acknowledged to need help and the middle-class who are expected to help themselves. So if it is all paid out of taxes, rich and poor and everyone in between, you don't need a big bureaucratic structure to decide who is unworthy and who is not.<br /><br />The really tragic stories are those who have health insurance, and so believe they are covered, and then get denied coverage by their insurance company for something they really do need. We are not talking vanity plastic surgery here, folks; we are talking basic health care needs.<br /><br />So Michael Moore, in his very boy-next-door style, shows us people in America who have had terrible problems due to the HMOs and insurance companies who find it in their interest to refuse treatment. And he shows us how different the situation is in Canada, England, and France. And finally, in Cuba.<br /><br />In a bold move that I couldn't help admiring, he noted that the prisoners of war on Guantanamo Bay have free health care, and better than what most of us have. So he loaded up several fishing boats with three ailing 9/11 rescue workers who could not get adequate care in the US, and a lot of other people who were not getting adequate care here, and took them to Guantanamo. Not too surprisingly, they were not permitted to land. So they went to Havana. And the Cuban doctors (those evil Communists) asked for name and date of birth, and provided them with the diagnostic tests and treatments they needed. One woman had terrible respiratory problems as a result of being at Ground Zero for some time breathing in ashes and whatever else. She had an inhaler which cost her something like $120 in the US. This is a huge sum when she needs one or two a month and she only gets $1,000 a month from SSDI. In Cuba, the same inhaler cost the equivalent of about $.05 -- yes, five cents. The Cuban doctors sent her home with a stockpile.<br /><br />We really do need to get behind HR 676. If the insurance companies and HMOs don't like that, there are plenty of other places for them to make their money. We will still need other types of insurance, and other types of financial services. It's not like they actually perform a real service for the money they make. They are essentially bookkeepers and record keepers, when they are not worse.<br /><br />And the pharmaceutical companies? They may not make as big a profit as they do now, but once the ones who require record returns on their investments have turned elsewhere, there will still be profits to be made at a reasonable level for those who survive. The ones that are currently making the generics can be re-tooled to make other drugs with little trouble.<br /><br />This movie is a must-see, especially now [2009] that Congress is working on a reform bill that is supposed to solve some of these problems -- and will undoubtedly fail to solve others.</p></body></html>

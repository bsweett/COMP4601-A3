<meta name="summary" content="It's Funny, Enough Said"></head><body><p>I didn't even bother to read reviews for Nacho Libre but seeing it with anything below three stars to me is unfair. I seriously don't understand why some people even attempt to watch a film like this knowing it is out of their field of funny. I actually enjoyed Nacho and it hit dead on to my expectations. Plain and simple the film is about a man Named Ignacio who is the cook for a Mexican monastery orphanage that doesn't have money for good food and spices. Ignacio gets up every morning to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it's always the same exact meal, cabbage and mayonnaise soup or mud. Already you feel sorry for the poor kids but one day a new nun shows up, the beautiful sister Encarnaci&oacute;n played by Ana de la Reguera. Ignacio becomes inspired immediately but doesn't get the courage to live his dream to be a luchador, if you know anything about the history of the luchador you know how respected they are and in here well paid win or lose. When Ignacio finally gets the courage to enter a match with his crazy unexpected partner he enters under the Nacho Libre<br /><br />Though Nacho treated himself to a few luxuries it is always about the kids for him and he made sure they had good food. One major thing I loved about Nacho Libre is that it was very funny but it showed no disrespect to the Mexican or luchador culture. It tells a story and though I'm almost sure Jack Black doesn't have a Mexican background he played his role very well. The funny stuff in Nacho libre comes from a lot of things and I think the funniest were the wrestling matches. Nacho and his partner lost every match and their girlish screams were too much. Then you have Jack Black's accent which is just too much or when he's about to fight someone and shows them his skills and jumps in the air and meows like a mad cat.<br /><br />Though Nacho didn't win any matches for a good period of time and somehow got a chance to fight the champion is understandable because some of his matches were close and you could see him progressing. I seriously saw little problems with Nacho Libre and I really enjoyed it. I don't know what people look for when they watch this movie because it is very different from the same old same comedies. The cast was great, not only Jack was the funny one; his partner really did a nice job supporting him. Great movie and I would recommend it for anyone that needs a movie for the entire family to watch and I give it four stars for the slow beginning.</p></body></html>

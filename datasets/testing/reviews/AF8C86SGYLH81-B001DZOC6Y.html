No script, horrible acting, no meaningful plot...just an embarrassment to the director and to Mark.  The best part of the film is the artwork on the box...dead cars on a lonely highway.  Maybe that's what this should have been entitled.  Avoid at ALL cost.  I paid 1 cent (plus shipping) for this one and I still feel like I was totally ripped off.  I can't believe how bad this film was.  All I will remember is a wind machine blowing the leaves on trees...this one probably cost $500 to make...and that includes the special effects.  Shyamalan needs to hang it up...Wahlberg is much too good for this garbage.  I gave it ONE star because I couldn't give it a ZERO!  I feel like there was more depth in this review by me, than the entire script by M. Night.  GOODNIGHT M. Night.  I'll never give your future films another chance.  You truly laid a rotten egg with this one.</p></body></html>

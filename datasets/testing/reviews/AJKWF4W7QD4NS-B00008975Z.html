It all starts simple enough; six perfect criminals are brought together by Joe (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Eddie (Chris Penn) to pull a diamond heist.  None of the criminals know each other and are assigned color coded aliases: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blond (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), and Mr. Brown (Tarantino).  But this simple plan goes awry, and the remaining criminals make it back to the hideout and eventually realize that one of them is a rat.  Reservoir Dogs shifts back and forth through time to let the viewer the get to know the characters, but Tarantino's true genius is the fact that the film thrives on the characterizations and dialogue which carries Reservoir Dogs to unprecidented heights.  Superb performances from everyone involved, especially to Keitel and Buscemi in the beginning of the film, and the last quarter of the film belongs to Tim Roth.  The film is violent, no doubt about that, but nowhere as gory as everyone claims it to be.  The infamous ear scene (involving Michael Madsen gleefully torturing a cop taken hostage with a razorblade while listening to &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot;) is nowhere as graphic as some claim it to be, but it is disturbingly hilarious.  The minimal budget only adds to the grittiness of the film, and Tarantino is clearly a writer and director in his element.  The new edition DVD's from Artisan (there are five different covers) are lightyears beyond the original Reservoir Dogs DVD; you get two discs (disc one is the film in widescreen while disc 2 is the film in full-screen) and extras including new interviews with Tarantino, Tim Roth, Mike Madsen, and others along with featurettes on the Reservoir Dogs action figures, a tribute to Lawrence Tierney, trailers, and a commentary from Tarantino and co.  All in all, Reservoir Dogs is a cinematic triumph and crime noir classic not to be missed.</p></body></html>

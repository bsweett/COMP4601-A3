<meta name="summary" content="The Best 007"></head><body><p>I won't repeat what just about everyone else says here: GOLDFINGER is probably the best James Bond movie ever made.  It's a slick, well-oiled machine that established a formula still in use today, 40 years later!<br /><br />My hat is off to the screenwriters: in the original novel, Auric Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox using a system of trains and ships, an impossible and unbelievable task.  That the screenwriters decided to add the A-bomb element to Goldfinger's plan (irradiating the US gold supply to make his own more valuable) is, as Bond says, "inspired."<br /><br />(The novel's buzzsaw inching forward between 007's legs becomes an industrial laser, making for another classic scene).<br /><br />I've seen this movie most of my watching life, and I could put it in the DVD player right now and watch it again.<br /><br />That's a great movie, no matter how you slice (or laser) it.</p></body></html>

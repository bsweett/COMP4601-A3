This is what makes it possible to do such credible Bogie imitations. "What is it?" "The stuff that dreams are made of."<br /><br />The Maltese Falcon is a black statuette of a falcon. The original purpose was the Knights Templar's tribute to the King of Spain. (The opening text refers to them as the "Knight Templars" for some bizarre reason.) It was made of solid gold encrusted with precious gems. It was stolen before it ever got to the king, and stolen from the thieves down through the centuries. At some point it was covered with a glossy black ceramic to disguise its gems.<br /><br />Sam Spade (Bogart) is a San Francisco detective; his partner is Miles Archer. They get a client who claims her sister has run away with a sinister character named Thursby, and she wants to get her sister back. Miles goes to meet Mr. Thursby, but he is shot at point-blank range instead. The logical assumption is that Thursby shot him, but then Thursby is shot dead. Not hard to guess that the police figure Spade shot Thursby, since they first speculated that he had shot his partner.<br /><br />There are three crooks who are apparently working together to discover the Maltese Falcon, Mr. Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) and Peter Lorre. Both are defining roles for these actors. I've seen this movie so many times I can nearly recite it, and yet the whole complex structure continues to fascinate me. All the characters seem to be motivated by the immense wealth of the falcon's gem-encrusted golden body and the estimated $1 million it is apparently worth. (That's 1941 dollars, too, which might be 10 to 20 times as much now.)<br /><br />Try hard to keep all the characters straight in your mind. Try to guess who is working with whom, who is about to betray whom. Good luck! A film to remember the golden age of Hollywood by.</p></body></html>

You had an ex Legionnaire, played by Fraser, a clumsy but beautiful librarian (Weisz), her gold hungry brother, and an Arabian holy warrior fighting to keep a mystical mummy from coming to full power.  It was a great romp and we had a blast watching it.  In my opinion, the best thing about the Mummy Returns is that not only does the Mummy return, so does everyone else...well at least everyone who may not have died in the first one.  It is great to see all the familiar characters come back.  Once again, the believability and plot are stretched to their limits but also once again, the movie moves at a blinding pace.  The action and story are well structured, and the script is solid, if not hokey at times.  The story is more original, dealing with the reincarnation of Imhotep's lover as well as raising the Mummy again as well.  A chase begins, as Rick and Evelyn (and friends) pursue Imhotep and his allies across the desert.  In the tradition of making a sequel bigger and better, the formula sometimes gets too big for it's own borders, but director Stephen Sommers seems to know when to draw the line in most cases.  He maintains control and still keeps the movie from going awry.  The special effects are once again incredible, but in some places, too much CGI may have been used.  The fight scene at the end would have been better if they had toned down certain aspects.  I won't say more about it for fear or ruining it for those who may not have seen it, but if you liked the first movie, there is no reason why you wouldn't like this one.  You may not like it as much, or you may like it more.  But like the first one, take it for what is; entertainment.  Nothing more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another film that "means something"."></head><body><p>"LEAVES YOU COMPELLED!"<br /><br />"HAUNTING!"<br /><br />"BRUTALLY POIGNANT!"<br /><br />Bla, bla, bla. Hollywood's more stylish stepson is at it again, this time in the form of Million Dollar Baby. I want to first state that I didn't see an agenda to this film like many nay sayers of this film claim exists. I simply thought it played us like fools, though, and "indy" (does such a thing exist anymore?) film patrons are laughing at the legions of peons once again.<br /><br />Before you crucify my post here  (I write that with an understanding that many readers here have already seen the film and formed an opinion on it) I want to ask you one question. In light of the constant nihilism we see in our world and our movies, does it not irk you a bit that the films that "mean something" these days leave you empty and dead, half beaten to death on the side of 1213 Film Viewer Drive? Does it make you feel good to shed an artificial tear over a fictional story, an especially contrived one at that? Does it make you feel good - as it did me - to walk out of the theatre and feel desperately worse off for having seen a film, whiping the tears from your face as if our viewing of a film had any significance on the world at large? Does it? If this is escapism, let me go back to jail. At least I won't contemplate suicide there.<br /><br />If you enjoy snythetic emotionalism that kills your soul in less than three hours, this film is perfect for you. If not, save your tears for something that actually matters. There's plenty of sad films out today, why bother with another one?<br /><br />Remember, PLATOON and TITANTIC both won best pictures too and last years LOST IN TRANSLATION was the hit on the indy front. Food for thought. Are you grasping my flow here?</p></body></html>

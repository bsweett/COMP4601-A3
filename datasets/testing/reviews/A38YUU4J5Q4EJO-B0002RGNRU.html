<meta name="summary" content="DEEP-  I Appreciate it more with each viewing !!!!"></head><body><p>It's true! The more times I watch this movie, the more I discover! It's like peeling an onion- as each layer of skin comes off, it reveals yet another layer...and so forth.There is so much more than meets the eye each time around.<br /><br />The story is centered on a couple ( Jim Carey and Kate Winslet)<br />who after 2 years together,have a nasty arguement, and Winslet goes to a company that specializes in erasing unpleasant memories, and has Carey erased totally from her memory.<br />After He realizes what she has done, he is too hurt to go on without her, and he in turn has her erased.<br /><br />During HIS procedure is where most of the movie takes place-In Carey's unconcious mind. The deeper they probe into his memories to erase her, the more he realizes he really loves her and don't want her erased.<br /><br /> Unconscious though, he is unable to stop them, so begins a dillema in his mind to HIDE her in other PARTS of his memory, And THAT is where the story gets SO original !!! As we see them mapping his brain on a scanner, we see the couple running crazily from them through his memories- LITERALLY!<br /><br />We are also treated to other characters stories : Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood (The staff at the Company that does the erasing)and thier characters add a lot of flavour to the movie, too.<br /><br />I seen another reviewer say that they kept track of time by her hair color (which changes from one bizarre color to the next)and that is also how I kept track.Because it skips in time- a LOT, but in a good way.<br /><br />I just absolutely LOVE this movie, and LOVED seeing Jim Carey in such a serious role  He is so awesome in this!<br />The only reason I only gave it 4 stars, Is that,though<br />it was directed good, I think the directing could have been better.<br /><br /> I think we should have got to know them as a COUPLE a little better BEFORE the break up, Not DURING the erasing procedure. The first time I seen it, I didn't really sympathize with Carey while he was Grieving toward the beginning of the movie- I think SOME of thier closeness should have been revealed earlier on.<br /><br />Over all though, This film is PURE entertainment! - GENIOUS !!<br />I will watch this movie over and over for years to come , and always reccomend it to others.</p></body></html>

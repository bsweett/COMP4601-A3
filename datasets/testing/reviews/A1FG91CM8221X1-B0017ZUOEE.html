<meta name="summary" content="A ghost story in the classic tradition."></head><body><p>"The Orphanage" was the first feature film not only for director Juan Antonio Bayona but for a large portion of the crew, including the screenwriter and the cinematographer. The film, however, would be a remarkable achievement for the most seasoned veterans in the business. A haunted-house story in the classic tradition of "The Haunting" and "The Innocents," "The Orphanage" unfolds deliberately, planting all the necessary clues in due course, not revealing all its secrets till the very end. Bayona makes us care very deeply about the characters, particularly Laura (Belen Rueda), whose growing horror, desperation and despair mirrors that of the audience. "The Orphanage" is for the most part free of gore; Bayona, unlike most young directors today, realizes that what he doesn't show us is infinitely more horrifying than what he does. The final ten minutes will fill you with horror, but also with emotions far more mixed and complicated than horror, and that is what raises "The Orphanage" far above a mere genre exercise. Beautifully photographed and designed, impeccably acted by both the adult and child actors, "The Orphanage" will linger in your memory as the great ghost story that it is. Be sure to watch the short "Making Of" documentaries on the CD's Special Features section; they are informative and charming, and also serve to defuse any lingering fears you may have for the well-being of the cast!</p></body></html>

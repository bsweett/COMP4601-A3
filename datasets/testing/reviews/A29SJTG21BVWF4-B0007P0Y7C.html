But she is going through a rough time in which she doesn't see the HUMAN inside herself.  AS an assassian she is given the job to kill a man and his daughter only to find out that she is the next generation of people who will save the world.  SO Elektra can not kill her because of that.  During the rest of the film we find that ELektra has indeed found her Humanity and self-respect again.  She now is able to live life as she was meant to.  With dazzling special effects and decent acting this movie is a more than entertaining film about self discovery.  However, it is choppy at points and never truely pushs its ideals onto the audience in which it is trying to please.  A movie that is good for fans of Comic books and an average entertaining movie for everyone else.</p></body></html>

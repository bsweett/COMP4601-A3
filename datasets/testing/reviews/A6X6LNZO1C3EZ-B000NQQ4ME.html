It is a film about the decline of the Mayan civilization, tribes attacking other tribes, brutal violence, gore, human sacrifice, and primitive warfare - usually involving a lot of death.  There are several Latinas and Latinos in this film (some were genuine Mayan people), along with over 700 extras, with a lot of careful emphasis on realism during the making of the film.  The jungle scenes and sets used were in Mexico, and right down to the last detail it is obvious the amount of effort invested in wardrobe, make-up, and even the Mayan language used in the film was heavily researched to be as authentic as possible.  With a budget of over $ 40 mil, this DVD movie impresses nearly any audience willing to watch a film with subtitles (anybody in the viewing audience translate original Mayan?).  There are lots of lovely women who share their assets with the camera, however, this film makes such an effort at realism that it doesn't seem like gratuitous exploitation eye candy just for the sake of the rating.  I'm guessing the R-rating is mostly for the violence and gore.  Although some of the plot is predictable, I give this 5 stars for keeping me watching without using the FF button on the remote, even though I've seen it three times.  This DVD has a "making of" type extra on it, and the widescreen film presentation is clear, great sound, and perfect color.  The subtitles are tastefully done, and seem to match (as far as I can tell) with the scene.</p></body></html>

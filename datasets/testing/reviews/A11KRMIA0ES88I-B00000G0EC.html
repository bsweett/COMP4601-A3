<meta name="summary" content="Jurassic Park"></head><body><p>Dinosaur-mania peaked with the movie based on Michael Crichton's novel. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic Era between 65 and 220 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divides into Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. Jurassic Park brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA. They are kept on an island with plans of making them an attraction. They get loose. The velociraptors are fierce. T Rex goes on a rampage. I felt that not enough species were represented. Where are triceratops and stegosaurus? duckbills and ankylosaurs? The theme that man should not tamper with nature is ridiculous because the whole point of science and technology is that man can better himself by understanding and harnessing natural forces. Movie makers are negative. Both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg use dark, chaotic scenes.</p></body></html>

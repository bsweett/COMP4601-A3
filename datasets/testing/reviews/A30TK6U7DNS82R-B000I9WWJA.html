However it is still an extremely fun ride and two of the actors, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, deliver fantastic performances.  The jury is out on Clive Owen's accomplishments here.  OK, he's hampered by a mask but just the other day I saw what Hugo Weaving could do with an even bigger mask in V FOR VENDETTA and sorry, Clive Owen fans, your boy isn't really giving the part as much as he might.<br /><br />At the end I was a little bit puzzled about why the bank robbers had committed the crime.  Wish someone would explain it to me!  Was it just for the money--apparently not.  And why would our lead villain hold on for so many years to a document that incriminates him when he could have disposed of it at any time?  And also, how old is Christopher Plummer supposed to be, anyway?  I would say he would have to be around 90 for the story to really work.  Sorry, he doesn't look ninety.  However all these quibbles amount to Monday morning quarterbacking when one considers the brilliance of so much of the rest of Russell Gewirtz' ace screenplay, which gives us everything we want from a police procedural and more.<br /><br />Denzel's character this time out is a private man with strong ties to his job and his community but he's feeling those ties start to fray, especially when $140,000 worth of cash money has walked out the door under his watch during a recent check cashing sting operation, so for the first time he's on the defensive, very much so.  In his home life he is living with an extraordinarily sexy colleague whose young brother's a crackhead and lives in a cot together with them in a too-small apartment.  Situation volatile, but Keith Frazier doesn't sweat the small stuff.  Though it may seem as though Denzel has played this part a thousand times, he completely reinvents himself here and only once or twice does our normal Denzel sneak in, take a quick bow, and disappear again behind the Frazier mask.  I for one would enjoy seeing him and his partner solving another case, pitting against another super villain.  The partner is played by the British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor who was also in Spike Lee's crazy SHE HATE ME movie.  But mostly I remember him from being the bad guy in SERENITY.<br /><br />My favorite however is Jodie Foster.  It's excellent that Foster seems to be returning to films in a big way, what with this, FLIGHT PLAN, that French movie, and upcoming a new picture with Terrence Howard.  Though some dislike her for being cold and controlling, here she takes her worst flaws and really plays them up as Madeline White.  And girl, she looks good in a NYC ivory linen power suit with her long, long legs and hip swinging walk.  She's playing a woman who likes men, a lot of men, a lot of dangerous men.  All in all a different kind of part for Jodie Foster, and she looks like she's having a ball, good for her.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a truly great movie"></head><body><p>I wasn't sure what to expect with the news that a new Rocky movie was in the works.  I thought to myself "Well, maybe this is just TOO much and the series should have stayed in the past where it belongs".  BUT, I was wrong.<br /><br />This movie really surprised me with the amount of emotional scenes.  More emotion than the older Rocky films, which is amazing.  This is what REALLY made the movie shine in a light that made the entire thing worth watching over and over.<br /><br />The emotions obviously lead up to one heck of a fantastic boxing match at the end.  Who wins the fight?  Doesn't matter, and you'll see why at the end.  What a great way to end an interesting series, that's all I'll say about the ending.<br /><br />Another thing that surprised me was the way the entire movie had a creepy, quiet tone that pretty much stayed like that until the training for the main boxing match at the end.  That tone really helped keep my interest in the storyline, so a job WELL done.<br /><br />Another cool thing is how the storyline leads you believe Rocky is too old to ever fight again, and then you see a completely different person when the time comes for Rocky to fight.  Awesome.<br /><br />You must see Rocky Balboa to watch how to properly tell an interesting and emotional story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The movie that started it all..."></head><body><p>Mind you, this is by no means the first animated project Disney did - there were all the black-and-white shorts as well as some color shorts, but Snow White was the first full-length animated movie that Disney produced.<br /><br />Like other fairy tales, Disney took liberties with Snow White. We see NOTHING of her father, so we assume that he is already dead. It's unclear what Snow White is Princess of, so the background could use more work. Still, the evil Queen was nicely done, and this movie features stuff that would become typical Disney fare - animal buddies, musical numbers, a happy ending, what have you. I do wish that the movie had been more faithful to the tale in the part where the Queen disguises herself. In the movie, she only presents a poisoned apple, but in the story, she first offered a comb (poisoned, of course) and a girdle/corset/belt (depends on what version of the story you're reading) that made Snow White unable to breathe. I'd have liked to see the comb and belt in the movie.<br /><br />The dwarves are very likeable, and it's great to see the relationship between Snow White and them develop.<br /><br />I'm not really crazy about Snow White's costume design, the dress could have been done better, but her face is just darling.</p></body></html>

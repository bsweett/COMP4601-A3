<meta name="summary" content="First A Pirate, Now a Bleached Blonde"></head><body><p>Gotta hand it to this Johnny Depp guy:  the dude has some range.  From Revlon mascara in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean,&quot; Depp makes yet another fashion statement--ultimately showing that blondes do indeed have more fun--in his role as an addled, befuddled, quirky, annoying writer in the film SECRET WINDOW.<p>In fact, there wasn't much to this movie that I didn't find annoying.  The plot was tedious and anemic, as was Depp's performance as writer Mort Rainey.  And let's not forget (oh, how could we?) the persistent redneck hick, played by a backwoods-looking John Turturro, who basically has one line in this film, uttered ad nauseum:  &quot;You stole my story.&quot;  With Mario Bello playing Depp's soon-to-be ex, and Timothy Hutton in the role as the soon-to-be ex's main squeeze, we suddenly have all the ingredients for an out-of-control, over-the-top ending that comes from literally nowhere.<p>Allegedly supposed to be some sort of a thriller, SECRET WINDOW is a wet noodle devoid of even spaghetti sauce.  A reclusive writer in a cabin, stalked by a Mississippi nutcase, a bitter divorce, and then total wackiness--none of this stuff works.  At least Depp's blonde hairdo works.  I wonder if he'll be a fiery redhead in his next role?<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

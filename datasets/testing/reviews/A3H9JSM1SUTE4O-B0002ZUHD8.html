<meta name="summary" content="A DECONSTRUCTED ARTHUR"></head><body><p>KING ARTHUR Unrated Director's Cut (Touchstone) is better than the theatrical version.  When I saw "King Arthur" on the big screen, I was expecting a movie filled with myth, mystery, magic and mayhem.  In the director's cut, at least the mayhem has been considerably enhanced and it appears other moments and elements have been added that create a more satisfying movie experience.<br /><br />Publicity for "King Arthur" said it's the untold story of the real man who became the Arthur of legend. But in fact this is merely screenwriter David Franzoni's politically correct take on snippets of loosely interpreted fifth century history.<br /><br />Clive Owen is a forceful screen presence as Arturus and Stellen Skarsg?rd is very effective as his Saxon nemesis Cedric.  A game Keira Knightly goes ballistic as warrior Guinevere in her skimpy leather battle gear and face paint.<br /><br />But even with a terrific set piece battle on a frozen lake and the extended, bloody confrontation at Badon Hill, this film does not do justice to the extreme religious and political forces -- primitive Christianity, paganism, Roman occupation and of course Pict, Saxon and Celtic concerns and claims -- that warred for control and in some cases survival in fifth century Briton.<br /><br />The extras include an all too brief round table discussion with cast and crew.  It's interesting to see and hear producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Antoine Fuqua, stars Clive Owen and Keira Knightly share their insights and anecdotes about the film-making process and their characters.  There's an OK making-of featurette and better than average commentary by an articulate Fuqua.</p></body></html>

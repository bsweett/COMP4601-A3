Maria, the young woman who just couldn&#65533;t make it within the confines of a nunnery, leaves the convent and becomes nanny for a widow with a bazillion cute kids. In his grief and ineptitude, he has been trying to run the household along military lines, and it falls to Maria to add warmth, sunshine, music and love back into their lives. The movie is set in Salzburg during the early years of the Nazi occupation of Austria and is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family. Love, tragedy, drama, suspense, a daring escape over the Alps &#65533; and joy. Who could ask for more from a film?<br />And then there&#65533;s the music, the Rogers and Hammerstein score from the Broadway play, which has given us such timeless tunes as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria, My Favorite Things, Edelweiss, So Long &#65533; Farewell, etc.<br />With Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as the Baron von Trapp, it&#65533;s a winner for all ages.</p></body></html>

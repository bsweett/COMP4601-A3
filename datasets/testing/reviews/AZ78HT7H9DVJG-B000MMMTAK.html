As I was watching (and laughing), I can see where some people just might get turned off and get offended.  Otherwise, keep an open mind and just see what's so hilarious about Borat.<br /><br />Borat is a reporter in his country, Kazakhstan.  Borat and his producer, Azamat go to America to make a documentary on American culture.  This is where things go awry and hilarious.  Borat just cannot understand why people do not do certain things and is puzzled when they "bared their teeth".  For example, the 2 quick pecks on the cheeks when greeting is the traditional custom for Borat.  However, Americans resist that particular kind of greeting.<br /><br />Borat cracked me up when he meets diverse Americans, such as gays, Blacks, the upper class, prostitutes, Pamela Anderson and Jews.  What was even more hilarious was when Borat catches Azamat using the Pamela Anderson book as a stimulation for self-pleasure, Borat goes ballistic.  They wrestle in the nude and run out to a conference hall chasing.<br /><br />Now, *Borat* isn't funny every single seconds.  There were a couple that were worthy of a half-chuckle.  It did have a couple of short slow or dry moments.  Other than that, *Borat* was consistent with humor throughout.<br /><br />But, let me say it again, it is offensively funny.  So, you can either be silly and laugh or be serious and take offense.</p></body></html>

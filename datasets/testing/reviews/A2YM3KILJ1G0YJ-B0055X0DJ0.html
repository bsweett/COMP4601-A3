<meta name="summary" content="Exactly what I expected, better than the original, and I'm still a bit unimpressed"></head><body><p>First and foremost, let's get the positives out of the way.  The action and special effects in this movie are incredible.  It's nothing less than one would expect.  During all the battle scenes, and especially during the scenes around the pyramids, there are some incredible, sphincter-tightening, tense moments.  For sci-fi fans and special effects fans, this may well be in the pantheon.  Transformers II is a "shut your brain off" good time, with explosions, transforming cars, crisp action scenes, and a decent enough plot that has the feel of a National Treasure sequel.  But with alien cars that can shape-shift.  And speaking of that, this movie makes a significant improvement over the original by giving more attention to the Transfromers and less to the humans.  Now that that's out of the way...<br /><br />Let me get this right.  Shia Lebouf's character goes away to college, leaving the impossibly hot Megan Fox and his shape-shifting car back home?  Let's back up one second, because that's just too colossally ridiculous.<br /><br />He leaves Megan Fox - who is clearly about 500 miles, 250 football fields, and 98 fathoms out of his range - his current girlfriend that will epically dwarf all other possible girls and/or women with which he'll ever be with, or probably even see in college (read: ever), to go to a far off college that requires a webcam for communication?  You're telling me there wasn't a diesel engine tech school nearby?  Any time an integral story arc derives from American Pie II, and the movie is not meant as a ridiculous yet enjoyable comedy, it's usually a bad thing (even Jim realized he screwed up by leaving Nadia and would never have a chance with a woman like that again).  All of this, of course, is secondary on the WTF-scale to the fact that he actually leaves Bumblebee behind.<br /><br />Bumblebee, his sentient, alien, shape-shifting car who not only helped Shia land Megan Fox, but also helped save his life, and can pull up any song in the history of songs on merely a whim - which is like having a 1-million disc CD-changer - being abandoned is just too hard for me to believe, even if it is a Michael Bay blockbuster without common sense.<br /><br />It's a fun movie with a few unnecessary parts, and some really stupid humor shoved in, but overall I'd recommend it (mainly for Megan Fox and the action).</p></body></html>

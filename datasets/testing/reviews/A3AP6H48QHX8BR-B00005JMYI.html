<meta name="summary" content="Will Ferrell IS A Comic Genius"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell is simply one of the finest comic actors of his generation. His comedic style isn't suddle at all and he is so clumsy and akward on screen you can't help but LOVE him... Former SNL star turn superstar Ferrell has made a name for himself as the comedic willing to go the extra mile for another slapstick joke- Anchorman- written and I believed produced by Ferrell is no differant.<br /><br />Ever absurd incident is hillarous and although the movie itself is absurdity of situations from Ferrell playing the jazz flute, to having his dog drop-kicked off the side of a bridge because of an anger motorist, to having an all out battle between all the news stations involving a man on being on fire and a grenade... Ferrell's amazing absurdity of events seem to work to create a movie that my ten year-old brother and I LOVE to watch...It's the perfect choice on family movie night for us because both the kids and adults seem to enjoy it together...<br /><br />It's movie about a time when everyone believed what they heard on TV and only men where allowed to read the news. Arrogant and over the top Ron Burgandy(Will Ferrell) the man about town is suddenly threatened when Veronica Cornerstone(Christina Applegate) takes the position as co-anchor. The two mutual hate eachother- Ron who reads anything off the telepromter is uncermoniasly fired when Veronica puts "Go F*** yourself San Diego" during a broadcast. Ron's life halts and with a absurd amount of ridicolous issues the story ends with a "life-changing" happy ending.<br /><br />Although corny, and slap-sticky the movie is still enjoyable because of it's all-star cast and the amazing comic genius of Will Ferrell who gives his best performance(even better then Old School).<br /><br />The kids and adults in our family seem to enjoy it on family movie night making it a good movie to rent or own in your collection!</p></body></html>

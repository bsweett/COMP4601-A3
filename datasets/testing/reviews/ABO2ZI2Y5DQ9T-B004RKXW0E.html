<meta name="summary" content="Great Finale with Humor and Heart"></head><body><p>Making a sequel is a tricky business, especially when it is a hugely successful series. When it is a second sequel, stakes get higher. Look what happened after the great one-two punch of "Godfather" and "Godfather II," or "Alien" and "Aliens"? So when I heard Pixar was making "Toy Story 3," I was naturally skeptical. After 11 years since "Toy Story 2"?<br /><br />OK, I admit. I was wrong. As many people say, "Pixar can do no wrong." I am not actually sure about that (as the last year's "Up" was something of a disappointment), but as far as the "Toy Story" franchise is concerned, it is true. People at Pixar will not be likely to fail in living up with our expectations.<br /><br />Andy has grown up. As he is leaving home for college, and his sister is moving into his room, there is no reason for his toys to remain there. After some misunderstandings and confusions, Woody, Buzz, Jessie and other lovable toys find themselves in Sunnyside Daycare center, where Lotso, the bear with a strawberry scent politely welcome them. Maybe too politely.<br /><br />"Toy Story 3" is a rip-roaring "Great Escape"-type adventure film with lots of funny moments, providing many rousing action sequences interspersed with comic relief, but there is also a darker aspect to the deceptively simple story, which will make you think, for instance: What happened to Wheezy the Penguin and Andy's other toys? What happened to yours? Where are they now? We are touched by the characters and their struggle to survive because we know exactly that in reality most of them cannot escape the inevitable (an attic or a garbage truck, as the film suggests).<br /><br />That's why the ending is very important. Some viewers may be surprised at the finale which I am sure will make you cry, but this is also a clever way to conclude the story that started 15 years ago. See it for yourself.</p></body></html>

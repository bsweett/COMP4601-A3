<meta name="summary" content="The Devil's Rejects Is Defintley A Film No One Should Reject"></head><body><p>I wasn't a big fan of House Of 1000 Corpses. But, I still wanted to give The Devil's Rejects since I loved the characters. When I saw this film this summer, This film was the best horror film this year and one of the best films this year.<br /><br />Rob Zombie returns to conclude his story after House Of 1000 Corpses. In this film, the police finally go to the old farmhouse to take down the killers. The arrested Mother Firefly {Easterbrook}, but Otis {Moseley} and Baby {Moon Zombie} have escape. Also, the police are after Captian Spaulding {Haig}, who is apart of the murders. Now, Otis, Baby and Spaulding are trying to get to Spauding's brother Charlie {Foree}, so they can hideout there. Their mission isn't gonna be easy, especially since the Sheriff {Forsythe} is hell bent of getting revenge because they killed his brother.<br /><br />This film really gives you the feeling of those old 70's horror classics like The Last House On The Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film look, the visuals, the 70's music being played just gives it that feeling.<br /><br />House Of 1000 Corpses didn't give you that feeling. House Of 1000 Corpses feels like watching a Rob Zombie video. Which I have no problem with that, but Zombie said that it reminds you of those old horror films from the 70's...and it didn't<br /><br />The Devil's Rejects is a great horror film and I hope to see Rob Zombie write and direct more films in the near future.</p></body></html>

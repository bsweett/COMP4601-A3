They either barely resemble the original (like the Claire Danes version of The Mod Squad) or turn it into kitsch parody (like The Flintstones). More often than not the contemporary update pales in comparison. As a result, there was a healthy dose of skepticism when a remake of Starsky and Hutch was announced. Would Hollywood ruin yet another vintage TV show?<br /><br />Surprisingly, the movie is not an out-and-out parody but plays things fairly straight. It is set in the 1970s and actually has a story that one can follow instead of the typical M.O. of these kinds of films that simply string together a bunch of loosely connected comedic set pieces.<br /><br />Starsky and Hutch is a vehicle tailor-made for Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's comedic talents. Stiller plays Starsky as an intense, by-the-book cop, while Wilson's Hutch is the laid-back, loose cannon. You would think that after all of the films they've done together their schtick would have gotten old by now. However, they play so well off each other. Their comic timing is dead-on. The give and take of the dialogue between them is effortless and enjoyable to watch as the mellow Hutch constantly baits the easily flustered Starsky.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Todd Phillips. He dishes a lot of trivial factoids on this rather bland track.<br /><br />"Fashion Fa Shizzle Wit Huggy Bizzle" is a brief tour of Huggy Bear's funky retro outfits and stylin' pimp wear with Snoop Dog. Not surprisingly, ol' Snoop displays a real knowledge of `70s fashion.<br /><br />"Last Look Special" gently makes fun of these kinds of puff promo pieces as Stiller, Wilson, et al "talk trash" about director Phillips. This is a fun, little extra.<br /><br />There are several deleted scenes that run six minutes in total, including one that has Starsky lecturing Hutch about peeing in public. There are some funny bits here and it's a shame that many of them were cut out.<br /><br />There is also a five minute "Gag Reel" that is a slightly amusing collection of blown lines as the cast try hard to keep a straight face during certain scenes.<br /><br />Finally, there is the obligatory theatrical trailer.<br /><br />This is a movie that could have been so easy to screw up. It's amazing that all involved did such a good job. They've created an entertaining and funny movie that pays homage to the classic TV series and yet also stands on its own. This is an excellent example of how to remake a TV show the right way.</p></body></html>

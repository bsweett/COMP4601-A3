<meta name="summary" content="A Great Tribute To The Human Spirit"></head><body><p>CINDERELLA MAN is one of the most outstanding boxing movies ever produced by Hollywood.Filmed mostly in Toronto, it follows the career of James J. Braddock who fought from 1926 to 1941.Plagued by brittle hands,Braddock still manages to win the heavyweight title from Max Baer on June 13,1935 in Long Island City,New York.The win is considered a remarkable feat for Braddock since he has sufferred many defeats due mostly to persistent injuries in prior years.The fact that Braddock loses his first title defense to Joe Louis in 1937 is not highlighted in the screenplay.The motion picture is fascinating for boxing fans as it dramatizes Braddock's bouts with Max Baer,Art Lasky,Corn Griffin,Abe Feldman and John Henry Lewis as well as Baer's fight against Primo Carnera for the championship in 1934.<br /><br />The movie does not try to alter Braddock's history and Ron Howard deserves high praise for his direction.Russell Crowe is convincing as Braddock and Renee Zellweger does a magnificent job in her role as Braddock's resolute wife.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti won Best Supporting Actor Awards from both the Boston Society of Film Critics and the Broadcast Film Critics Association for his portrayal of Joe Gould, Braddock's manager.</p></body></html>

His best film, The Fly (1986), is not one to watch while you're eating but under Cronenberg's direction it became more than a horror film, instead a surprisingly moving love story. Facing Eastern Promises, which deals with the Russian mafia, I was certain bloodshed would be prominent but would Cronenberg manage to deliver a great film rather than just a violent one?<br /><br />The film opens with two interesting scenes: the first is of a man, Soyka (Aleksandar Mikic), who is murdered by a barber Azim (Mina E. Mina) and his nephew Ekrem (Josef Altin). The film then switches to a fourteen year old girl Tatiana (Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse) who wanders into a chemist and collapses, blood seeping down her legs. She is rushed to hospital and found to be heavily pregnant. Though the baby is delivered safely Tatiana dies leaving the attending nurse, Anna (Naomi Watts), with the baby and a lot of questions. Anna finds Tatiana's diary but realises it's in Russian though there is a card tucked in the pages for the Trans-Siberian restaurant. Anna wants to know more despite the concerns of her mother Helen (Sinead Cusack) and uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) who is of Russian descent and is insistent the diary is none of her business and should be left alone. At the restaurant Anna encounters the owner Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who is head of a Russian mafia family and seems keen on obtaining Tatiana's diary, offering to translate it for Anna. Also at the restaurant are Semyon's ruthless son Kirill (Vincent Cassell) and the family's driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) who also dumps bodies in the River Thames. While Anna digs deeper into the Russian family's connection to Tatiana, Nikolai begins rising through the ranks under Kirill's guidance but he is drawn to Anna and she to him, suspecting there is enough good in him to help her.<br /><br />After an intriguing opening with a murder and birth, Eastern Promises divides its time between Anna's search for the truth about Tatiana which leads her to asking her reluctant uncle to translate the diary. Tatiana is connected to Semyon and Kiril and her story is one of hope and excitement in the early pages but as the story unfolds we discover she is an unfortunate girl who has made it to Britain for a new life only to fall into the hands of the wrong men. The mafia boss, Semyon, seems cool and polite in his meetings with Anna but once he is alone with his family the mask is removed and we see his true colours, which incidentally are not pleasant. His son, Kirill, seems even worse in his dealings and his time with the driver Nikolai is in initiating him into the family to become a vory v zakone - the equivalent of one of the soldiers whose insignia is specific tattoos. Each of the mafia members are heavily decorated with tattoos, the symbols designating their heritage, prisons they've been in and their status. It is these honours that Nikolai, already heavy set with tattoos from his own past, wishes to obtain for himself but he is in complete contrast to Kiril, quiet and reserved though unmoved in getting his hands dirty, or bloody in this case.<br /><br />As the film progresses the murder of the man in the barbers at the start becomes more significant. It transpires that Kirill ordered the murder without the permission of his father which leads to the siblings of the murdered man coming to London seeking revenge. Nikolai is faced with many dilemmas as the plot moves along frantically. Kirill's life is in danger but with Anna uncovering some of the dark secrets from the Russian family's past he is left with divided loyalties. Nikolai shows moments of decency and humanity in his dealings with Anna, fixing her motorbike that breaks down outside the restaurant and delivering it to her at the hospital where she works. Capable of violence and tenderness, Nikolai is very hard to read and has many secrets of his own, rather surprising ones as well. In another scene Nikolai faces an uncomfortable test from Kirill when they visit a brothel and Nikolai is ordered to prove he isn't gay by having sex with one of the prostitutes (most of them underage) while Kirill watches! Nikolai does as he is ordered then asks for Kirill to leave. Alone with the distraught prostitute who comforts herself with a song from her homeland, Nikolai asks for her name before giving her a large amount of money. We later learn the prostitute is gone and Kirill is furious to have lost her, but Nikolai simply shrugs his shoulders and offers no explanation. The secrets Anna shares with Nikolai about Tatiana including the diary seemingly have no impact on him, even when she asks how he can serve the mafia family, and things become even more complicated when Nikolai is ordered to kill Anna's Russian uncle!<br /><br />Eastern Promises has only one weakness and that is the abrupt ending. Though it's clear what the eventual outcome is for Anna and Nikolai in their respective paths there is still some ambiguity as to how this has occurred. That said the rest of the film is brilliant with a terrific cast especially Mortensen whose Russian accent is far from embarrassing and let's just say any of you ladies or gentlemen that find him easy on the eye can look forward to a spot of nudity from Viggo though the rest of the scene may put you off! The rest of the cast are all good with Watts, Mueller-Stahl and Cassell all providing great support.<br /><br />Eastern Promises is a violent but terrific thriller, bringing the Russian mafia to the streets of London. Though let down slightly by the abrupt ending the story is very engaging and the acting excellent so that's just a minor blip in an otherwise brilliant film. Not quite as good as Cronenberg's The Fly but a great achievement nonetheless.</p></body></html>

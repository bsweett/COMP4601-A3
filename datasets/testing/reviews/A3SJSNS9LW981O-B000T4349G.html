<meta name="summary" content="Out "X-Files" the X-Files!"></head><body><p>This film delivers a slick thriller, touching on all those nerves that the X-Files used to... paranoia, hidden mysteries and conspiracies, and a "true believer" who has to convince a skeptic of a startling reality.<br /><br />The story is very ominous, very mysterious. It will keep you engaged up to the end.<br /><br />Where this movie trumps the cynical X-Files is that it is a positive, life affirming triumph of good over evil... not just a depressing wallow or pity party. well done!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, the author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Noir Plot with a Mellow Protagonist Offers an Intriguing and Hilarious Perspective."></head><body><p>On the heels of their 1996 masterpiece of sly humor "Fargo", Joel and Ethan Coen made "The Big Lebowski". It lacked the intensity of the sharpest Coen brothers films and failed at the box office only to become a cult classic, basis of its very own subculture, and one of the Coens' most analyzed films. The world of "The Big Lebowski" is familiar territory: the Coen brothers like to play with the idea of a fundamentally disordered universe, the world of film noir with a darkly humorous edge. The humor in "The Big Lebowski" isn't as dark as usual, though, owing to the fact that its protagonist is a laid-back, aged hippie whose feathers don't ruffle easily, dropped into a Chandleresque mystery that boggles him about enough to annoy even a stoner peacenik.<br /><br />Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski by two thugs who break into his apartment, rough him up, and pee on his rug. As this is obviously unjust, the Dude decides to seek compensation from the other Mr. Lebowski, the rich old man whose young trophy wife apparently owes someone money. Mr. Lebowski (David Huddleton) is reluctant to pay up, but when his young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) disappears and there is a ransom demand, he thinks the Dude is just the man to deliver the money. Being a basically agreeable fellow, the Dude agrees but inadvertently involves his bowling partner, a highly strung Vietnam vet named Walter (John Goodman), who is more a liability than a help. Meanwhile, the Dude's new rug is stolen.<br /><br />Even the pauses in the Dude's speech were scripted, but this is still one of the most memorable performances of Jeff Bridge's long and impressive career. The Dude is hilarious and endearing and wise without wanting to be. He wants to drink his White Russians and bowl. This is film noir without a noir protagonist. Instead of imploding in a fit of existential angst, the Dude reacts to the confusion and injustice by trying to go with the flow -or trying to ignore the issue. The world doesn't let him; it turns him into a reluctant detective. "The Big Lebowski" is replete with staples of film noir, from identity confusion to rapid dialogue. But the Dude offers a unique reaction to the dilemmas of a world that doesn't make sense. It's hilarious and, at the same time, an interesting perspective.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008 10th Anniversary edition): The 10th Anniversary edition offers two featurettes, a comedic introduction to the film (4 ? min), Production Notes (text), and a theatrical trailer (2 ? min). "The Dude's Life" (10 min) interviews the cast about their characters and what made the Dude so popular. In "The Dude Abides: The Big Lebowski Ten Years Later" (10 min), the cast talks about the evolving perception of the film and about the dialogue. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

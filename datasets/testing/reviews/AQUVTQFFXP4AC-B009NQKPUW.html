Being billed as somehow the next generation of movie-making, an epic so incredible and so beyond the medium of cinema itself, with a plot supposedly so spellbinding and powerful that it has to be kept secret until the screenings.<br /><br />And I can safely say there was almost nothing original, colossal, or paradigm-shifting in this entire movie.<br /><br />The plot is basically the next step to the Ancient Alien craze brought on by the crazies on "Ancient Aliens" on History Channel (IF ALIENS DIDN'T EXiST, HOW DID THEY BUILD EVERYTHING?!  I DON'T KNOW, THEREFORE ALIENS), by having someone rich and stupid enough front a trillion dollars for a deep space vessel to follow up on what they think to be a starmap in the form of pictographic carvings found all over the earth from far-flung, disconnected civilizations all portraying the same set of circles in the sky.<br /><br />Leaving side the obvious conjecture that maybe they all saw the same cosmic event or series of meteors rather than assuming it's somehow alien-related, the fact that this starmap leads where it does makes it a gaping plot hole, considering that the location the go to is one where the aliens clearly would never want us to ever find if we did manage to reach the technological level to find it and go to it.  Add to that the fact that it's a trillion dollar mission that could have ended up leading to nowhere if my hypothesis that it wasn't aliens was correct.<br /><br />There are no real "characters" to this story; they're little more than cardboard cut-outs with their personalities etched in their faces and speech.  Archetypes largely consisting of people with no discernable purpose beyond dying and being "sciencey".  Their only role in this movie is as "Meat 1", "Meat 2" and so on.<br /><br />Considering this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION trying to find THE FIRST ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH, much less ALIENS WHO CREATED US, this is facepalmingly stupid the cast of cretins they've gathered up for this mission.  I literally thought the random punk guy was some random mercenary hired on for protection, so I was genuinely shocked when they started relying on him being "sciencey" later on in the movie.  The rest of them are stupid enough to make people with even the most basic knowledge of archaeology and biology shake their heads.<br /><br />Considering once again that this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION bent on finding LIVING ALIENS, I honestly thought it was either an inside joke or a jab at the people when they walk into an ancient cavern on the alien planet, unopened in 2000 years, and start TOUCHING everything, stepping everywhere, and SITTING on the artifacts.  There's a reason archaeologists use those tiny little brushes to dust off found artifacts; THEY'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE AND DOCUMENT A SITE; THEY DON'T JUMP INTO A PIT OF BONES AND START KICKING SKULLS AROUND.<br /><br />They also see fit to take off their helmets, just because the air is breathable.  Nevermind the fact that people are strongly urged to immunize just to visit another country for fear of contracting some unknown disease, these people are on a WHOLE OTHER PLANET UNTOUCHED BY HUMANS OR ANY LIFE FORM FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS.  The TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION could've ended then and there with all of them dying of space-smallpox, and all due to their own stupidity.<br /><br />Pretty much from the moment of their arrival, the movie plays out less as THE STORY OF OUR BEGINNING and more like a typical horror movie.  I had constant instances of deja vu with this movie reminding me of scenes from "Alien vs Predator".  Even the characters had exactly the same tones and reactions as those in AVP.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is a great actor, but his performance here is terribly uneven, though it seems more to me symptomatic of bad writing than any fault of his own.  His entire opening sequence of him watching Lawrence of Arabia, combing his hair like Peter O'Toole, riding his bike while shooting perfect hoops in basketball, and just walking around maintaining the ship play him up as a bright-eyed innocent, an android fully aware of what he is and giddy to learn more about the world and himself.  Then at random instances, he becomes sarcastic, dry, seemingly malevolent, even snotty, enough to arouse suspicion in a child, much less supposed scientists on a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION.  He then pulls a temporary heel turn with a little "science" experiment that would be considered crude and reckless by Medieval standards of medicine---people DID practice quarantine back then.<br /><br />I say temporary because as the film progresses some more, this action of his not only proves to be pointless, but is subsequently dropped and ignored for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Then comes the whole moral of the story... I see a lot of positive reviews mentioning that it's okay that the story "doesn't explain" everything, or that it's not the film at fault if you "don't get it".<br /><br />Well I got it.  What I got was grade-school navel gazing hiding its own childishness behind a slick veneer of cool and hip to dismiss any criticism as "You just didn't get it".<br /><br />As much as I trash on "Ancient Aliens" on History Channel, I find the idea of paleolithic contact to be utterly thrilling, only waiting for even the slimmest shred of evidence to justify giving it further exploration.  This movie began with something like that, and close to the end, completely dropped the existential navel-gazing unaddressed to turn to the philosophical quandry of a bawling child wondering "Why is daddy hurting me?"<br /><br />From there, another gaping plothole emerges; the aliens are suddenly hostile towards us, and the humans can't understand why.  They then proceed to make up reasons that completely ignore the facts; we're BAAAAAD people!  We burn fossil fuels!  We don't recycle!  We kill each other!  We eat animals!  We invent big shooty guns and bombs!  We touch ourselves at night!<br /><br />It never gets that specific, but the "Why me?" wailing gets tired, fast, and suddenly I realized I don't care what the aliens wanted.  If they have a problem with us and are unwilling to negotiate, we can just kill them all.  They DID leave their planet full of a self-replicating biological superweapon ABANDONED for two thousand years, and then left us with the starmaps all over our planet!<br /><br />The ending is typical, and would seemingly open the door for sequels, though of the sort that would be close to nothing like this movie, and thoroughly unwanted or uncared about.  Considering they had devised this great plan for the human race, it seems downright nutty of the scientist to STILL want to meet with them and ask them "Why me?"<br /><br />As for visuals, I suppose they were impressive.  I wasn't impressed with them; CGI is cheap, fast, and easy these days.  A dozen movies are churned out with better and better visuals and plots and characters just as bad every year.  Boasting the greatest special effects with no substance to justify them will only make the movie look quaint and silly in 5-10 years when something better is done.<br /><br />I found a slight comparison with this film and "2001: A Space Odyssey" and realized it was literally the exact same basic plot:  Man finds evidence of ancient aliens, invests in a deep space mission to seek out the aliens based on their map, stuff happens, only one survivor and their pet robot.<br /><br />What separates this from "2001" is that "2001" told a story that needed no words; it was the story of us, open to all manner of interpretation, with scientists actually behaving like SCIENTISTS---Poole and Bowman kept their calm when they suspected HAL of lying to them, they casually gathered inside a space pod to discuss it, they didn't freak out and start cursing at each other or playing childish games of pretend with a damn SUPERCOMPUTER thinking they could outsmart a machine designed to read people like a pamphlet.<br /><br />In "Prometheus", they don't let you think, at least not the way you're expected to.  You're not left thinking about our beginnings, or the ancient alien concept, so much as wondering the same dumb question of "Why us?".  In fact, when we saw the movie, the only thing we kept wondering about is exactly what the alien at the prologue did and whether he knew what was happening.  I don't think that is what the filmmakers wanted.</p></body></html>

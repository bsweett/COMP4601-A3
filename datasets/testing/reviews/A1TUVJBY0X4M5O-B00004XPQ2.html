The William Holden character, the American P.O.W., really should have been an interesting character.  He was almost interesting after he escaped, playing around with a girl on the beach...some of the dialogue was trying for some witty, snappy, Casablanca-esque pop...but it just wasn't there.  It just seemed like everyone was writing talking in slow-motion...all the actors were slaves to long-winded dialogue in the script.  I just read that Guinness wanted to play his character with a sense of humour but the director insisted he play it as boring as possible.  Someone needed to bring that fiery, sarcastic character and I feel it should have been Holden.<br /><br />Everything said in the same boring matter-of-fact tone for almost 3 hours...there's no background music to keep things moving along...I ended up dozing off in the middle somewhere.<br /><br />I'd never recommend this to anyone.  And I'll never see it again.  I've read it's supposed to be an anti-war movie.  Seems more of an anti-audience movie to me.  Too dated for modern audiences.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not for the shallow"></head><body><p>I would just like to add another positive review to this list,just because this movie was so...deep,so sad somehow,<br /><br />It made me feel so MANY things,and I never thought much about wine before I seen this movie...Driving through wine country and tasting along the way is what the story anchored on,But the people Miles and Jack come into contact with,how we connect with people we meet,was so true to life like.<br /><br /> Especially Miles character got to me so much. Jack was pretty shallow and his shenanigans were pretty..funny/stupid, but Miles character had raw EMOTION in everything he did and everyone he touched.<br /><br />I was happy we were left to believe he and Maya connected as a couple when he knocked at her door at the ending,His character was just so sad, unsure of himself,hurt after his breakup,dissapointed in all the people around him,and in life in general..<br /><br />If you are a person with a deep well of feeling,and an intelligent person, you will love this movie. It's one of a kind.</p></body></html>

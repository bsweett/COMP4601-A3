<meta name="summary" content="Hang On!"></head><body><p>If you enjoy white knuckle thrillers dripping with suspense and crammed with (often really over the top) heart pounding action, then THE FUGITIVE is a must-see.  I caught this little jewel on the tube recently and quickly was reminded how I sat mesmerized in the theatre back in the early Nineties during THE FUGITIVE's initial release.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are grand fun to watch as a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife (the sensationally gorgeous Sela Ward) flees from the law (while simultaneously identifying the real murderer, don't ya know) and is relentlessly pursued by a pit bull of a U.S. Marshal.  My goodness, we have train wrecks, jumping off of hydro dams, falling through skylights, and much more carnage requiring titanic suspension of disbelief, but come on, Ford plays a doctor who always manages to stitch himself up.<br /><br />The supporting cast is equally fun, led by Joe Pantoliano (one of my fave character actors), Jeroen Krabbe, and Jane Lynch in a very brief role (long, long before 'Glee' fame).  A young and sizzling Julianne Moore also appears as an overwhelmed ER doc.  Sure, the action comes in metric truckloads, but the suspense, plot, and pacing are finely tuned, and Ford and Jones play well off one another.  THE FUGITIVE is one fun rollercoaster; sit on your sofa and hang on.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hoggishly good fun"></head><body><p>This movie has got somewhat panned here in the UK, sometimes the UK and USA comedy genre don't quite meet but I found really funny in parts, perhaps because I am fan of Roth, Lawrence, Travolta, Liotta and Macey or perhaps because my comedy gene is more international than national!<br /><br />The movie premise is quite simple, take four middle aged men who have an urge to be bikers, put them on motorbikes, and send them on a 2,000 mile round trip and what do you have?  You have total mayhem, laughs galore especially when they meet up with a nasty Hells Angels type biker group led by the enigmatic Liotta.<br /><br />This is a real "popcorn" movie, you need to see it with your mates, and laugh at the cheesy one liners, and Liotta's dead pan character Jack.<br /><br />For me the best part of the movie is at the end when Ty Pennington makes an appearance, you will wet your pants laughing, especially as his cameo part is himself playing his Extreme-Makeover role, it has to be seen to be believed is all I can say!<br /><br />Hoggishly good fun that will tickle your funny bone and have you chuckling  none stop.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Have mixed emotions about this one......"></head><body><p>I have read most of the reviews on this one good & bad, & most are well defined, so I will try to give an honest viewpoint, first off, I don't hate this one, but I couldn't help but feel that it was trying too hard, below are my Pro & Cons on this one<br /><br />The Pros...(Good stuff)<br /><br />Cate Blanchett was a good villian, a step up from Allison Doody's Elsa in "Last Crusade"<br />The Area 51 sequence in the opening moments were fun, the blink-you-miss-it shot of the Ark was played for laughs no doubt<br /><br />Shia LeBeouf as Mutt & his appearance was accurate to the time (the 50's)<br /><br />Harrison Ford as a aged Indy was no different than a aged Obi-Wan or Captain Kirk<br /><br />The feel of the previous films was there...<br /><br />The action was definately on par with the previous films<br /><br />Now for the Cons...(Bad stuff)<br /><br />The return of Karen Allen was a bad idea, I have nothing against her as an actress, & loved her in the original, but, I just didn't see the point of bringing her back, she really wasn't attuned to her character in the first film, nothing about her in this one reminded me of her in that one...& why not bring back Willie Scott & Short Round too...<br /><br />Indy's sidekick constantly switching sides, if Short Round or Sallah had done this, Indy would have shot Sallah, & left Short Round in the "Temple of Doom", here he just goes with flow in the hope that his sidekick is on his side....<br /><br />The hypnosis scene involving the Crystal Skull.....what was that all about??...did I miss somthing?..<br /><br />The alien angle did seem out of place a bit, but not inconceivable considering that the Mayans were said to be super intelligent, & that many of the world's ancient places such as the Pyramids in Egypt are still a mystery, Lucas & Speilberg apparently are fans of the film "Stargate" with Kurt Russell, because they borrowed this aspect from it...<br /><br />Overall, I liked this one, but I feel that it could have easily ended with "Last Crusade", It is pretty clear that Lucas, Speilberg, & Ford all had different ideas here, & at times I felt that they might have been trying to accomplish different things, whereas in the previous 3 films there was a continuous flow, here, the flow seems to be going in different directions,<br /><br />& why end it with Indy & Marion getting married, you can't reconnect that fast, can you?<br /><br />This one to me is a mixed bag, after repeated viewings, these minor points are starting to bug me, I hate it when films I like do that to me, overall, this one is just as fun, but given Shia LeBeouf's recent comments about him & Ford being a bit displeased with it, you have to wonder if Lucas, Speilberg, Ford, & Shia are even speaking to each other right now...</p></body></html>

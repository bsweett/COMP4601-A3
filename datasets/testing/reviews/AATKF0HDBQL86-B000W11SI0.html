<meta name="summary" content="Adrien Brody handles role of Szpilman with sensitivity"></head><body><p>Roman Polanski's epic film The Pianist is a wonderful retelling of the life of Wladyslaw Spilman, a Polish Jew and magnificient piano player whose career was cut short when the Germans invaded Poland.  At first the restrictions placed on Szpilman and his family don't seem so bad, but as time goes on they are forced to move into the Jewish ghetto, where they are eventually loaded onto a train bound for one of the concentration camps.  As Szpilman is waiting to board the train with his family, however, he is pulled from the crowd by one of the ghetto police, Jews who are working for the German officers in hopes of better treatment, and told to run away.  From that point on his life becomes a struggle for survival, working for the Germans until they liquidate the ghetto, then being smuggled from one safe house to another until he is finally discovered in the bombed-out ruins of a flat by Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, a German officer who is so moved by Szpilman's music that he decides to keep the secret of the pianist's survival until the Germans retreat from the city.<p>Adrien Brody played the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman with great sensitivity, showing Szpilman to be a man of deep feeling who is witnessing the horrors of the war all around him, but doing what he must to survive.  Adrien Brody was able to make the character of Szpilman so believable and human that I found myself near tears several times during the course of the movie.  Thomas Kretschmann was also very good as Capt. Hosenfeld, the young German officer who provides aid and comfort to Szpilman after hearing him play the piano.  While I was watching this particular scene I could actually see Hosenfeld being torn between his duty to his Motherland and doing what he knew to be right as a human being, and Kretschmann played it just right.<p>In the end, The Pianist was a wonderful movie, and one of Polanski's greatest achievements.  I highly recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it do so at the first available opportunity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unique storyline and interesting animation make this a keeper"></head><body><p>My first grader has inherited my affinity for scary flicks, though of course all that she's been exposed to is the kid-friendly variety. Coraline is the darkest of all the "scary" flicks we've watched this October, but we watched it together, discussed various aspects whenever she had a question, and surprisingly she did not find it scary though she did comment on some parts being creepy. I think for her age, she probably did not quite grasp some of the darker aspects of the movie, but she did get the gist of the movie, and the message behind it.<br /><br />Coraline's story bears the message "the grass is not always greener on the other side." Coraline complains about her life with her parents, at not being able to do what she wants, when she wants, blah blah blah. Until one day, she discovers a door or portal into another world, where everything seems so much better, just like her present life, only more interesting and appealing. Of course there's a catch, and the seemingly "benign" mother figure in this other world soon turns out to be vile and wicked with an evil agenda - to keep Coraline trapped with her forever, as with all the other lost children. Coraline discovers that not only does she have to escape this evil entity's clutches, but also save her parents who have become trapped in another world, and free the souls of the captive children.<br /><br />The animation is unique and interesting and fascinated both my daughter and myself. I certainly think this is a movie that is more appropriate for older children, ages 8 and up, but with parental supervision and guidance, it can be appreciated by a younger child. It certainly brought up some interesting issues for discussion between my daughter and I. Intelligent, well-scripted (and based on Neil Gaiman's novel), this is a movie I'm adding to our DVD library. Now if only Gaiman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WUC5R2">The Graveyard Book (Hardcover)</a> would be brought to screen!</p></body></html>

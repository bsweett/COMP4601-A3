<meta name="summary" content="Hush/Hush"></head><body><p>Simply put, this film can't earn less than 5 stars; it's a seamless piece of work that should really have run off with more awards than it got.<p>The performances are universally excellent--and maybe the casting director has to take the credit, maybe not--so it's hard to pick a singular stand-out lead in the whole piece.  And Kevin Spacey is generally so good, we kind of take it for granted here.  Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce as virtual unknowns in a Hollywood picture convince you very early on that they belong in the film.<p>Shot on location in Hollywood, with all the appropriate setpieces, hairstyles, mannerisms, this is a film that (minus the profanity and nudity) could have been released 40 years ago to similar acclaim.  <p>It won a well-deserved Academy award for its screenplay, but from top to bottom, this film is a perennial and should find its way into every DVD player until the end of time.</p></body></html>

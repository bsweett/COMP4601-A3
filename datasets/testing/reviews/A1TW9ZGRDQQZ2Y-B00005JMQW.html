<meta name="summary" content="More like 4.5 Stars, but much better than the first Spidey!"></head><body><p>The first Spider-Man was okay, but part 2 is what the first one should have been in terms of pacing, story, acting, and of course the much improved SFX. This movie is much talkier and focuses in on the drama a lot more than the action. Some of the smaller children in the theater were getting restless for pretty much the whole film due to the little amount of physical action happening on the screen. Don't get me wrong there are some great action scenes, but they are spread thinly throughout this two hour plus film. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is great in terms of acting and is way cooler looking than that stupid Green Goblin outfit from the first film. Doc Ock is truly a memorable villian. Tobey and Kirsten are very good as well, but J.K. Simmons once again steal the show as the newspaper boss and thankfully gets a much bigger role in this movie. I also loved the opening credit sequence that fills you in on Spider-Man part one and the almost horror movie style done when Doc Ock is killing about 10 doctors with his tentacles while escaping from the hospital. The ending with Harry finding his father's glider and weapons was really pretty neat, but I just hope Spider-Man 3 has another villian to go with the not so interesting James Franco as the new Green Goblin. Bring on Venom in the next Spidey flick! While this comic book franchise can't compare to the first two Batman or Superman films, it sits nicely in third place behind them. Join the rest of society and swing by your local theater to see this flick now!</p></body></html>

The great film, Amadeus, does not even try.  It presents Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) as a punk kid, with pink wigs and an annoying high pitch laugh, who comes to Vienna searching for work in music.<p>It's obvious immediately to Salieri (F. Murray Abraham)that Mozart is a prodigy.  However, he is appalled to see what a brat he appears to be.  Consequently, he swears to bring Mozart to ruin.  <p>It's a fact that Salieri, later in life in an insane asylum, claimed to have murdered Mozart.  Historians are split on whether this claim has any merit.  The film, as I stated, does not take a side either way.  <p>The movie is great because the characters are so fresh and fun.  Mozart is a real hoot with his laugh and Salieri's intense hatred of him is obvious.  I also love Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor (remember his failed attempts to run down Ferris Bueller).<p>No one will ever know what happened to Mozart.  This film shows us a reasonable guess at what his last 10 years were probably like.  The music is great, the acting superb, and the film was definitely deserving of its Best Film award.  I find it interesting that Abraham and Hulce, after such a great performance in such a highly publicized movie, really have slipped into oblivion.  In this film, however, they were golden.</p></body></html>

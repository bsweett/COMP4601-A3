<meta name="summary" content="Marvelous"></head><body><p>Marvel seems to be resembling Pixar as of late, considering how they've made so many high quality movies, and success after success at the box office, with a seemingly unbroken string of great superhero films, from Iron Man, to the Incredible Hulk, and Thor.  One would think after a while, their luck would run out, and a sub-par film would be break the chain of hits.  Thankfully, with the release of, "Captain America:  The First Avenger," that string remains unbroken.<br /><br />"Captain America:  The First Avenger," tells the story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny weakling desperate to get into World War Two, despite his tiny form and long list of health problems.  Feeling left out when his friends and his country head off to war, he's offered the chance to join a program that may help him become a powerful super soldier, and help change the course of the war.  Jumping at the task, he quickly finds himself confronting what may be the Nazi's most powerful figure, and weapons that could end the war, and not in favor of the allies.<br /><br />What makes "Captain America" so great is that it knows exactly what it sets out to be:  A homage to the serials of the 30's and 40's, in the vein of Raiders of the Lost Ark (there's even a clever nod to it early on).  Combining elements of war films, science fiction, and pulp fiction, "Captain America" is a near perfect blend of all three, with great action scenes, an awesome retro feel, and a nice sense of humor.  There's nary a weak note to be found here, as the cast is strong all throughout, with Chris Evans portraying a hero who has no ego, and only wants to do the right thing, and Hugo Weaving proving once more that he can play bad guys like no one else, embodying the scientific madness of the Red Skull.  To top it off, the visuals and production values are top notch throughout, and the film really does feel like a comic book come to life, with each new action sequence outdoing the last.<br /><br />If I had to nitpick, the only real flaw in the film is a a romance subplot between Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter that I felt was unnecessary.  But even then, the film seems to realize the same thing, as it doesn't go very far, a fact that I'm glad for.  "Captain America" focuses on constantly providing thrills and adventure, and succeeds wonderfully.  While it does feel a bit long, I didn't mind in the slightest.  If anything, I wanted to see even more of Captain America's world, as this is a film filled with optimism, where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there's no grim and grittiness that so often drenches today's heroes.<br /><br />I could keep raving about the action, the costumes, the humor, but I'll leave it at this:  "Captain America" is now one of my favorite superhero films.  It knows what it wants to do, doesn't deviate from the path, brings all of it's elements together, and provides a light hearted escapism that the world so desperately needs.  If Marvel can keep making movies this entertaining, I can't wait to see what they have down the road!</p></body></html>

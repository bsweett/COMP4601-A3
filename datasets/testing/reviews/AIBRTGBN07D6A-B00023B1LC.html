<meta name="summary" content="Decent, but pretty much like any other action thriller"></head><body><p>I was really excited to hear one of my favorite books was being made into a film. I was surprised at the beginning whenn they didn't say &quot;based on the book.&quot; After watching it, I can see why. The only thing it has in common with the book are the characters and some of the first 5 minutes. The plot is completely different. The book is exciting because Jason Bourne (Damon) is up against the deadliest assasin of all time, Carlos the Jackal, and his origins are a mystery until the very end. Carlos is nowhere in this film, and the secrets of the organization Bourne is from is revealed in the first 15 mins.<p>Another thing that I haven't seen in over a decade, is a very anti-climatic ending. No real final showdown with the bad guy, no incredible revelations, just an action scene that's less exciting than the first fight Bourne has.<p>As a standalone film, it's entertaining. As a book adaptation, it's horrible.</p></body></html>

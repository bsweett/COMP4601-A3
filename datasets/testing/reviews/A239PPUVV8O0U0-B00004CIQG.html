Having Peter Sellers in the mix (in three roles no less) just makes it that much better. I knew he was funny and could pull off a foreign accent in the Panther films but to pull off British, American and German? The man's a genius! One of my favorite lines of the film is when he tells the General and Russian Ambassador:<br />"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"<br />The supporting cast is stellar as well; George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are excellent as the war crazed and psychotic generals. Slim Pickens is outrageous as he rides his bomb to oblivion. The innuendo throughtout is quite amusing because you have to be quick to pick up on them, like the names of characters, phallic images and so on. The idea of "nuclear armageddon" has aged little with the passage of time, even after the Cold War has ended. The way this film holds up today is incredible (and judging from our current relations with North Korea, couldn't be summed up better than with this).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A worthy successor"></head><body><p>In this day and age of lousy sequels, it's great when a filmmaker manages to up the ante and deliver an even better movie than the one that precedes it.  "X2" is one such example.<p>Although it's recommended you see the first movie to familiarize yourself with this one, it's not totally necessary.  This one has a bigger budget, and goes further into the character development without sacrificing any quality.<p>If Bryan Singer can make the third movie as good as this one, we'll be in for a real treat.  Wachowski Brothers, you might want to take some notes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bates Motel. We Are Open. Come On In..."></head><body><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Regarded by some as the finest Hitchcock film ever, Psycho begins gently, then slowly turns dark before becoming terrifying in one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed. Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin are the principal actors this time around, and involved in another sinister game of suspense as only The Master can cook up. Sir Alfred Hitchcock has surprised you before, but never with anything like this.<br /><br />Miles away from civilisation lies the Bates Motel. You are cordially invited to stay for a night or two...<br /><br />Rated R, but should be rated PG (mild violence).</p></body></html>

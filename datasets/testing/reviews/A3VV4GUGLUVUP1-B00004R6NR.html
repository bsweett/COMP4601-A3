Actually, it's more about the dinosaurs, which makes it ultimately a disappointment. Ironically, this movie about a theme park shares all their flaws: it's exciting, but ultimately, it's a shallow experience. <p> Based on the effective Michael Crichton novel, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is about a group of people trapped on an island amusement park where biotechnologists have resurrected childhood's favorite scary monsters. Sam Neill is a bland paleontologist who hates kids- guess who he bonds with in the park? Well, it ain't Vegas showgirls (although that would've made for a more interesting film). Laura Dern, easily the best actor in the movie, flounders without a character to play; she mostly giggles and mumbles. Samuel L. Jackson goes to waste (literally, after the dinos eat him) and Wayne Knight pretty much plays his &quot;Seinfeld&quot; character, Newman.  <p> There's one scene in particular that illustrates the major problem with this movie. Paleobotanist Dern studies a leaf and mutters how this &quot;shouldn't be here&quot; and how it's extinct, until Neill taps her shoulder, which causes her to look up and see a giant brachiosaur for the first time. Behind her, everyone else is already reacting to the as-yet unseen brachiosaur.  <p> The only reason she's looking at a leaf in the first place is so Spielberg can build suspense by delaying the dinosaur revelation. But in order to do this, they have to give her a reason to be so fascinated- ergo, extinct plant. Enter plot hole, in the service of audience manipulation. Did the Jurassic Park engineers also clone extinct plants? Or did they just happen to find an island with extinct plant life? And if it's not important, why introduce it in the first place?  It's a manipulative trick that's shocking in its clumsiness. <p> It's not that manipulation itself is a bad thing (Alfred Hitchcock was an admitted arch-manipulator)- it's just &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; does poorly so many of the things that makes a movie great. Think of &quot;Jaws,&quot; another Spielberg movie about a fangs; it's one taut bit of filmmaking. Not a bit of fat on the bones, not a wasted scene, even when they're not pursuing the shark.  <p> With &quot;Jaws,&quot; and Hitchcock's &quot;The Birds,&quot; you can forgive very dated effects because the people in the film are so believable and memorable, and the manipulation isn't so cynical or transparent. Despite photo-realistic dinos, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; has no more reality to it than &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean,&quot; which is referenced in one of the few intentionally funny bits of dialogue.  <p> <p> That said, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is fun for casual viewing, and I find it remarkable Spielberg pulled it off at all while also working on &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  Plus, there are two very effective set-pieces: the tyrannosaur attack on the tour cars, and the velociraptors-in-the-kitchen sequence; here, Spielberg uses his tricks to perfection. It's just a shame they're in the service of a special effects fest that's so... unspecial.</p></body></html>

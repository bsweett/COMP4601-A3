You will laugh and you will &quot;awww&quot; when you watch this movie. It's a great cinematic picture from Disney/Pixar, and the animation is breathtaking. <p>The premise is cute: in the world of Monstropolis, the inhabitants are all monsters whose job everyday is to scare all the world's children to power their city, which is quite charming. We focus in on two particular monsters: Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and his pal Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). Sully is trying to maintain his status as the #1 scarer of all in Monstropolis. But when a young sweet little girl crawls her way through her door into the world of Monstropolis, it's up to Mikey and Sully to get her back before everyone sees her and causes widespread panic, as humans are thought of as &quot;toxic&quot; in the world of Monstropolis.<p>You will love this charming tale, which will make a wonderful holiday movie, or if you're just in the mood for laughs and maybe even funny scares, you will surely love MONSTERS, INC. A highly delightful and very entertaining animated film indeed!</p></body></html>

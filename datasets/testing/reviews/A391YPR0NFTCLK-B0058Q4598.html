Keanu Reeves is standard here, Jennifer Connelly shines and the film brings up some extremely interesting moral points which helps amplify the great sci-fi aspects. the film rushed its final act, which is a shame since the rest of the film is really quite exceptional. this film is no disaster like many people say, give it a try.</p></body></html>

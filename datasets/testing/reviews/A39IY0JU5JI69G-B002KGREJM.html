<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable film; questionable history"></head><body><p>I passed on seeing this film when it came out in the theaters, in spite of all the hype and Forrest Whitaker's Oscar win.  I thought it was going to be a biopick of Idi Amin and that didn't interest me.  However, I got it free at the library and, the night before the DVD was due, I put it in the machine to see if I might be interested.<br /><br />The fact that the protagonist was really the young Scottish dr. made it more interesting to me than I had expected.  When I watched it, I assumed that it he was a real character.  Then, by reading the reviews here I discovered he wasn't, which puts the whole film in a different place in my head.  How much was real and how much wasn't??  It could worry me a little but I chose to let it go and just enjoy it.<br /><br />Actually the use of the dr. is a smart device that works well and it certainly makes for an interesting story.  James McAvoy is a bit annoying, but that is good, too, given the nature of the fellow he's portraying.  At first I thought he was going to be a real hero and I kept wondering when he was going to wise up and get out of there. A lot about him was "wrong" --he looked way too young and was just too scrawny and silly looking to have so many women falling for him.  And what was he, really, a good decent guy who wanted to help out, or a spoiled punk who was just out for an adventure???  I thought the character was really very well written and acted by showing the complexity of the guy.  I ended up by seeing him as totally believable.<br /><br />Forrest Whittaker was superb and surely deserved the Oscar. He portrayed the full range of this distressing man's personality with brilliance as everyone here has remarked.  I especially liked the childlike, innocent facet.<br /><br />But, after all the smoke cleared, it was the character of the dr. that most interested me.  Too bad, he was fictional!</p></body></html>

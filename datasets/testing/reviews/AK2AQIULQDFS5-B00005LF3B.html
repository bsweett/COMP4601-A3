The Acting, Directing and Production are all Perfectly Pulled off and it manages the Difficult task of pleasing Critics and Audiences. Tom Hanks gives the Powerhouse Performance we All Expected him to and Robert Zemeckis uses All of his Skills to pull off this Monumental Achievement. Even with our Raised Expectations, the film Still manages to give us Everything we Expected And More.<p>Unless you yourself have been Cast Away on an Island for 3 years, you'll know the films story, so I'll keep my Plot Synopsis short. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee whose plane goes down in a storm and he is washed up on the shore of a remote Island... Which becomes his home for 4 Long Years. "Cast Away" chronicles his Survival, his battles with Starvation, Loneliness and Madness, and finally his Eventual Rescue.<p>There was never a Doubt in the Cinema-going Publics minds that Hanks could pull this role off, his On-Screen Transformation is Truly Something to Behold. The whole film Rests on his sole performance, which made him the Obvious (and Only) choice, I doubt the film would have been given the Green Light had he not been involved. He makes us Feel Every Emotion he faces, he Mesmerizes us with his Traumatised Expressions, and he makes the 143-minute running time feel like an even hour. The Supporting cast have Precious-little time to make an Impression, and not One of them Waste that time. Helen Hunt goes through quite a Transformation too as Chuck's Fianc&eacute;, but hers is shown mainly through Facial expression and Body Language. Like Hanks, she Convincingly Conveys to us what She's been through as well, which is a Hell of a lot. Nick Searcy is a Standout as Stan, a Friend of Chucks. His couple of scenes with Hanks are very Heartfelt ones, Sentimental while also very Real. They are also Spectacularly Acted ones, like every other scene in the film.<p>The Screenplay is a Brilliant one, getting Maximum Emotion Impact out of a Situation that Is a tough one to film, but with Zemeckis behind the camera, the filming is in Wonderful Hands. Zemeckis uses Startling Camerawork and Brilliant use of Sounds and Silence to create this Landmark film, in my opinion; he is one of the Best Directors Working Today. "Cast Away" only Solidifies that Statement.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unimaginative and Passable Shoot-the-Monsters Flick: Better Than 'House of the Dead' But Thas's Not Saying Much"></head><body><p>The game is something you play, not watch. I don't know why some film producers keep making movies based on video games such as `Super Mario Brothers' `Tomb Raider' and `Resident Evil.' Like them `Doom' is inspired by a video game of the same name, which I have never played. If I have never played it, that is not because I hate playing computer games. I am sure playing the game is a much better experience than just watching it. You see, I can control (or try to control) the whole situation of the game. In film, you just watch.<br /><br />Still, though I give the film only two stars, watching `Doom' is much better than watching dismally bad `House of the Dead' and perhaps two `Resident Evil' films. It is absolutely meaningless to say that the film's plot is familiar and recycled. There is no other way for anyone to make a film out of shooting game, of which main purpose is to provide the thrills of shooting and being shot, bitten, or killed. Plot is only a starting point.<br /><br />So I didn't complain when the film introduced us to the near future world of the year 2026, and the special force led by `Sarge' played by The Rock sitting before a PC without wearing a shirt. These eight soldiers (including top-billed Karl Urban, the real star of the film) are sent to the laboratory of one corporate facility on Mars, where something went wrong, but what went wrong you can successfully guess before the rescue team. So far everything resembles `Resident Evil,' but even when I noticed that, I didn't boo or leave. No, there is another reason for me to dislike the film.<br /><br />Though Director Andrzej Bartkowiak quite wisely shortened the introductory part of the film, his job gets slack and lazy after the team arrive at Mars. In addition to the poorly designed creatures, the team's prolonged search for the survivors damages the pace of the film, only to make the bigger and better action sequences and shoot-outs in the final chapter less impressive. But this awfully slow-paced middle-part has been seen in the films by Andrzej Bartkowiak, who gave us `Romeo Must Die' and `Exit Wounds' the latter being the last decent film starring Steven Seagal. Certainly photographer-turned-director Bartkowiak can deliver, but he takes too much time before doing that.<br /><br />And in the last shoot-outs, the filmmakers made an interesting decision to insert the shooter's viewpoint while fighting the monsters. As you see on the smaller screen of video game, you see the evil creatures get shot and blown up to pieces, the point of view that shows how a solider sees things over the barrel of a gun. Then I was reminded of two things; one is the point where I started - game is made for us to play. The other is the name of James Cameron, who improved the POV idea by using the video monitors attached to the soldiers. Here I expected to see Cameron's brilliant touch which elevated the clich&eacute;d ideas to the higher places with adrenaline-filled intense direction. Maybe I shouldn't have.<br /><br />`Doom' is not a terrible film. It is a passable fun movie, but I couldn't find the reason why this film should be made.</p></body></html>

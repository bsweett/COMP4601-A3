I'm  gonna look at this as just a film, which seems appropriate enough, considering that that's what it is.<br /><br />As pretty much everyone has mentions, `United 93' manages to avoid pretty much all of the obvious potential  faults it could've had.  Realism is always of the utmost importance, and Greengrass doesn't sentimentalize the situation, and most significantly, the film is devoid of any apparent commentary or moral and simply presents the events flatly, assuming that they will speak for themselves.  I think Greengrass gets perhaps a bit too much credit for his straightforward presentation.  As far as I'm concerned this approach is a bare minimum requirement for the film to be any good at all.  Still, consider this requirement met.<br /><br />`United 93' is essentially two films in one, one excellent, the other okay.  These divisions come between the scenes actually on and involving United 93, and the scenes involving the FAA and air traffic controllers on the ground.  I'm less fond of the scenes on the ground, as they eventually prove to be somewhat dull and repetitive, because they consist of little more than a large number of people talking with one another, trying to figure out precisely what is going on and how to deal with it and so on.  I don't doubt that they're extremely accurate, and they are necessary to the film as a whole, seeing as how there just isn't enough going on in United 93 for it to carry a feature length film, but we definitely didn't need as much of this as we got.  Certainly, these scenes are sharply and professionally done, but there just isn't that much to them.<br /><br />The scenes on the plane itself are far better, though they too could probably stand to be trimmed ever so slightly.  Obviously, there's going to be an enormous amount of conjecture going on in these parts of the film, but it always feels extraordinarily real.  Greengrass does a particularly good job with the terrorists, not portraying them as utterly inhuman monsters, but not falsely trying to excuse their behavior.  The passengers themselves are realistically devoid of characterization--  There wouldn't have been any time for them to really get to know each other, so we see simply see them on the surface, identifying them by little more than their faces.<br /><br />Greengrass uses `documentary-style' filmmaking, meaning lotsa of wobbly, handheld camerawork to go along with some frantic editing in the confrontational scenes.  This is always a dangerous tactic cause if you do it poorly it's incredibly obnoxious, and makes the film utterly unbelievable. (i.e. Scenes shot this way often degenerate into a random juxtaposition of images with no comprehensible relation, and thus become totally cinematic and thus utterly unrealistic, on top of being just as annoying as hell.)  Fortunately, this method is used better here than in perhaps anything else I've seen, as it generates a real sense of chaos and claustrophobia while still remaining fairly easy to tell what's going on.  At it's best, particularly during the initial overthrow and the final rebellion, the film generates a sort of bleak, horrific intensity that has rarely been matched else where.  Of course, it's only operating at it's highest level in a few scenes, since most of the scenes on the plane are in anticipation of the conflict, but these other scenes are more eventful than one might anticipate, and the whole film is effectively suffused with a sense of dread and impending doom.  (One which, I believe, would still be there even if we didn't already know the outcome.)<br /><br />Frankly, I don't buy the assertion of so many reviewers and viewers that this is an `important' film.  How so?  To remind us or convince us that 9/11 was a very bad thing?  I must say, I already thought that.  Still, this is an intense, often fairly moving and very professionally made film that shows the potential of more realistic, less stylized and conventionalized form of cinema. Again, it could stand a few trims that would then heighten the impact, but what is here is certainly effective enough as it is.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

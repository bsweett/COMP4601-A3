<meta name="summary" content="P. U.! This dreck is a miserable and poorly done remake of  Logan's Run"></head><body><p>At one time, Brad Pitt was attached with this film. Boy was he lucky he bailed on it.<br /><br />The Island is a really really badly done sci fi flick that would have you believe it is unique and new. It isn't. It is a very thinly (and poorly) veiled remake of Logan's Run (from the 1970's).<br /><br />The Island borrows heavily from films such as The Matrix (didn't you think the clones were houses similarly to the people under control by the Matrix?), Minority Report (that piss poor film starring The Scientologist), and then completely steals huge chunks from Logan's Run.<br /><br />The years is 2014 and Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen are perky little citizens of a utopian society in which the citizens have no independent thought. Suddenly McGregor gets it in his head that he's going to go out on his own. Why? He has bad dreams (but aren't these the same dreams everyone else is having? Yes. Later,we're even shown that the others have these same "memories" implants).<br /><br />He sneaks away and discovers that his civilization's life is all a big lie and that they are nothing more than the parts department for the rich and wealthy who can afford to have clones created for use as spares for when they are injured or dying.<br /><br />The rest is a chase film wherein the bad guys try to keep the clones from blowing the whistle.<br /><br />If you've ever seen Logan's Run, you'll remember all of this as well. However, Logan's Run did it far better - and surprisingly with better special effects.<br /><br />The mere premise of this film is silly and feeds into the mentality of the mindless millions of television viewers whose salacious appetite for Jerry Springer-like reality has given television networks latitude to further dumb down the television audience. Ooooooo, what if it really happened? Ooooooo what if I ran into my clone?<br /><br />The Island tells us that the rich are evil and should be stopped. Jerry Springer's core audience will eat that idea up.<br /><br />At least in Logan's Run, the blame was given to all society for being such sheep and believing whatever was being told to them.<br /><br />Are the rich evil for being wealthy and should they thus be punished or are those who want others to tell them what to think and do to blame for their lot in life? I think that's the difference between The Island and Logan's Run.<br /><br />I'll take the message from Logan's Run any day of the week over that of The Island. At least it means that I'm not so stupid that I'll do whatever someone else tells me to do.<br /><br />Don't bother.</p></body></html>

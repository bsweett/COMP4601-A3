<meta name="summary" content="a ruthless look into the mind of a tyrant"></head><body><p>young Nicholas is a scottish doctor who decides to go to Africa and become the personal physician for the Ugandin leader Idi Amin. as the doctor becomes more engrossed into the leaders life, we slowly see how Amin rises to power and in the process slowly delve into madness until he would forever be remembered as one of the most ruthless tyrants ever known. i will admit just like everyone else that Forest Whitaker's Oscar winning performance is really the driving force of the whole movie. his potrayl of Amin is both suductive and tyranical, sometimes even at the same breath. you can just feel the power he admits of screen and slowly but surley delve into a dark recess of his mind that explodes in kinetic energy. MacAvoy more then holds his own with Forest, in a role thats is a nice change from playing a fawn in The Chronicles Of Narnia. i want to clear up an issue most people are having with the film. most people are saying that Forest's role is only a supporting one and that MacAvoy is the real main character. let me be clear, according to Academy rules, an actors performence can be considered either a leading or supporting role. it all depends on what the people lobby for, trying to give the actor a better chance at winning. example, Jennifer Hudson was nominated this year for supporting even though she has more screen time then Beyonce, the leading role but they lobbied for supporting to give her a better shot at gold, which she won by the way. comprende? and plus, its really Forest who is the real lead in this film. so to see a true powerhouse performence, Last King Of Scotland is the one for you. see it for Forest.</p></body></html>

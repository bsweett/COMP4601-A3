<meta name="summary" content="It could have been better"></head><body><p>This have been a better movie if they kept the demographic audience in mind. It didn't need a complicated script. It was a slow start. Forty minutes before any real action started. It's when Bruce Banner has repressed childhood memories resurface that it becomes interesting. The special effects are not great but good enough. I loved him rampaging through Utah and San Francisco (Hulk-a-roni, the San Francisco treat!). I like Nick Nolte as David Banner, the mad scientist. His speech near the end of the movie amused me. And the last three to five minutes was perfect ending. At least it was to me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slow and Somber, But Sharp and Intelligent"></head><body><p>Sharp and intelligent thriller "Michael Clayton" follows a titular character played by magnetic George Clooney, a lawyer (or a "fixer") at a major New York law firm. He is facing a crisis in life, reaching 45 and heavily in debt; he doesn't like his clients, he doesn't like his jobs, and he knows he hasn't achieved anything in his life. And he must choose what he should do before the film ends, but can he really do the right thing?<br /><br />Directed by Tony Gilroy (his debut film) known as writer for the "Jason Bourne" trilogy, "Michael Clayton" builds up its story very slowly in the first half and you need to be patient at times as if to pick up and put together pieces of a puzzle. I said it is a thriller, but not in the way as three action-packed Bourne films. It also deals with a similar topic as "Erin Brockovich," but you can see the truths from the beginning.<br /><br />The thrills of "Michael Clayton" come from the round characters and their moral conflicts - Clooney's Clayton, Tilda Swinton's chief counsel for a big company "U/North" and Tom Wilkinson's brilliant, but now mentally unstable lawyer whose long monologue in the opening sets the tone of the film. Their acting is all wonderful, worthy of Oscar nomination and winning.<br /><br />You will find "Michael Clayton" has several things that can be seen in other legal thrillers, but they are not used in a clich&eacute;d way. After all the film's tense atmosphere comes from the inner conflicts of the characters, both "good" and "bad" ones, who must do what they really don't want to do. Being somber and serious, this is definitely not a film to everyone's taste, but I liked it for what it is.</p></body></html>

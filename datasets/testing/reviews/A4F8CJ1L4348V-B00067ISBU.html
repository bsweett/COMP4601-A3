<meta name="summary" content="Great super hero movie"></head><body><p>I really liked this movie. I thought it was a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it. It was well told and the characters were well developed. The special effects were great too!! I am not one for comic book heros, but this one confinced me otherwise. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a comic book character.</p></body></html>

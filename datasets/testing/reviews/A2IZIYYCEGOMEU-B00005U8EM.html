<meta name="summary" content="A CLASSIC DAY IN THE LIFE OF ONE OF CINEMA'S GREAT CLOWNS"></head><body><p>Bill Murray's impeccable sense of timing, and Andie MacDowell's charm make this film of an egomaniacal weatherman caught in Time's revolving door one of the most fun-filled, comedies ever. Forced to relive the same miserable day over, and over, with consistantly hilarious changes that don't, at first, seem to be heading in any particular direction because there are no consequences for a man forced into this particular predicament, Bill's character ( Phil ) gradually begins to become human. The film is pure magic.</p></body></html>

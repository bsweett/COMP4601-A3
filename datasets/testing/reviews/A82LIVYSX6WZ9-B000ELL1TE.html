<meta name="summary" content="Pitt is at his best"></head><body><p>boy oh boy did Guy Ritchie create another masterpiece, its hip and original and sparking with funny dialouge and a lively cast, including Pitt with his garblemouth talking fistboxer. cool shootouts and fights and funny names like Boris the blade  and Franky Four Fingers(Benincio Del Toro, though he is killed too quick in here). the best scene is when the dog snatchs the diamond and eats it and Dennis Farina starts shooting and then he shoots out the window as the dog jumps out and then he realizes he shot his friend Vinnie Jones, just hilarious</p></body></html>

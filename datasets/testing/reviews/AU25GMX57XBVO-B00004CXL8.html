<meta name="summary" content="A Nicholson Classic"></head><body><p>There are not many movies with Jack Nicholson in them I don't like.  As good as it gets is no exception in that it is vintage Jack Nicholson.  He plays his typical role of a pretty good guy but seems to get himself into trouble.  The movie I thought could use a PG-13 rating and not sure why the industry rated it R.  There as some scenes that might be a little disturbing but nothing too overboard.  Very entertaining comedy that will go down as one of Nicholson's best since he did win an oscar for it.  Helen Hunt also plays her typical drama role good as well.  A must see for any Nicholson fan.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

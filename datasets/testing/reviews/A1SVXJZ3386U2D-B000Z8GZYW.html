<meta name="summary" content="Getting it Right"></head><body><p>Imagine someone who is a real self-centered jerk who suddenly gets caught in a time warp that causes him to repeat the same day over and over and over until he gets it right.  That is the fertile scenario that Bill Murray finds himself in when he wakes up repeatedly on Groundhog Day.  The first part of the movie sets the stage as we see Bill as a big-shot big-city weatherman trying to score with the young, attractive assistant producer.  They go to Puxsatawny, PA to cover the annual groundhog event along with their whimsical cameraman.  Things don't go well in his quest for seduction and he is shocked to discover that when he wakes up tommorrow it's yesterday.  There is a great deal of humor that comes from all of this as everybody does everything they did that day except our bewildered weatherman.  In time he discovers some advantages in this merry-go-round.  For example, he arranges to start taking piano lessons.  By the time it's all over, he has become quite the maestro though he has yet to reach tommorrow.  However, his repeated attempts to seduce the assistant producer keep coming up short.  He starts learning some important lessons about himself and others in this repetative day he's stuck in.  Though he improves so much as a person he is still stuck on what's best for him.  The moment he finally does something that's truly selfless, the next day arrives.  <p>I really enjoyed this movie and it is one of those movies that improves with each viewing.  I considered rating it higher but, apart from Bill Murray, the acting wasn't quite that spectacular.  It's a terrific movie for Bill Murray fans and it has a message that should appeal to everyone.</p></body></html>

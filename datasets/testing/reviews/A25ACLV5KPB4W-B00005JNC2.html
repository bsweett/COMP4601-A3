<meta name="summary" content="Funny and strange"></head><body><p>This movie hangs on the understated performance of Zach Braff, who travels back to his small town home after his mother dies to deal with her death and his father, a psychiatrist who has kept Andrew (Braff) on lithium since he was 9 years old.<br /><br />The emotionally numb Andrew is coming off of his medication for the first time since he was a boy, and he meets Natalie Portman, a quirky girl who seems to love him. The film basically tracks Andrew as he spends time with high school friends and tries to come to grips with his mother's death.<br /><br />This sounds like a depressing movie, but it's really not. The emphasis is on the eccentricities, and unexplored corners, of small town life.  Something about this set of offbeat small-town characters is more realistic than the traditional Hollywood paean to the wackiness of rural life. Everyone has problems, and there's nothing cute or empowering about a grave-digging buddy who makes a habit of making off with the jewelry of the corpses he buries.<br /><br />The dialogue is particularly well done, with lots of unfinished thoughts, interrupted conversations, "likes" and "you knows" combining to make the interactions seem very real.<br /><br />For all the serious subject matter, this is actually an uplifting movie, with plenty of very funny comedic scenes that make and happy spots to make us feel good. One scene in particular, featuring a Medieval Times Knight who romances his friend's mother in Klingon, is very funny.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that abounds in independent film, but which has combined art and realism with the commercial value and production value that make it viable for a major studio to get behind it. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

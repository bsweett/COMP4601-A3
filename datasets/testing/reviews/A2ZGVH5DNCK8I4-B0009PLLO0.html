<meta name="summary" content="The downright worst movie of 2004."></head><body><p>Oliver Stone is one of the most controversial filmakers of our time right up there with Martin Scorsesse,making such classics as JFK,the best picture Platoon and Born On The Fourth<br /><br />Of July.But whatever was made up in his mind to do this bitch of<br /><br />a mess god only knows perhaps he was drunk or perhaps he really<br /><br />wanted to try at this story of the Macedon King Alexander who<br /><br />at a young age of only 32 years conqured most of the known world.<br /><br />  First Of all the writing is terrible who the heck came up with some of these lines , there absolutely laughable and not<br /><br />even the slightest bit convincing.When Alexander and his lover<br /><br />Hephieston hug each other alexanders newfound wife who is played<br /><br />by Rosario Dawson says "You Love Heeeeem".In a scene between<br /><br />Alexander and Olympius when Olympius belittles her son and<br /><br />spits in his face she says " What did i ever do to make you hate me so".The acting speaks for itself Colin Farell is somewhat<br /><br />convincing as Alexander but the cheezy wig is not,everyone<br /><br />seem to have an accent of there own Angelina Jolies is the<br /><br />worst who sounds as if she is in transelvania.<br /><br />  Anthony Hopkins as Ptolomey gives a voice to Alexanders life<br /><br />but the film really never mentions much of anything about his life that makes the movie pleasent to watch.In the first two minutes you could care less about any of the chrachters<br /><br />because the acting is so downright awful.Two key battle scenes<br /><br />that Stone gives us Alexanders war against the Persian empire<br /><br />at Gaugamela where fights some 250,000 Persians,a battle that could have topped Return Of The King but didn't even touch it<br /><br />as no war scene in the history of film might ever.And one of<br /><br />Alexanders strangest battles in India where the Indian calvary<br /><br />used Elephants , worst of all is that these war scenes still<br /><br />don't make up for the mess that this movie is.But what destroys<br /><br />Alexanders chrachter is his crying in every scene for a mighty king he seem more<br /><br />of a panzy and less of a ruler of the known world.<br /><br />  It is almost impossible for me to buy that Oliver Stone did this excrutiating dull three hour mess, when compared to early<br /><br />2004's Troy Alexander makes Troy look like an Academy Award<br /><br />winning film and makes Gladiator look like Citizen Kane but he<br /><br />really messed the hole movie up by the editing because the movie<br /><br />just dosent make any sense at all on rotten tomatoes.com the<br /><br />reviews are humorious and laughable and barely anybody gave it<br /><br />a good review folks I think we have our razzie winner for the year because the razzies will eat this film alive and for this mess Oliver Stone deserves any type of review or hedious awards<br /><br />he will get he should be a man and just live with it.The Worst<br /><br />film i've seen of 2004 period laughably pathetic.</p></body></html>

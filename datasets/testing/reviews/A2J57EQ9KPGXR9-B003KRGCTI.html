<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Movie - A Modern Religious Fable"></head><body><p>I saw this film by accident. I actually went to the theatre to see "Avatar" (like everyone else in the state that day) and decided to see the Book of Eli since Avatar was sold out. I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />The Book of Eli is an amazing film for many reasons, mainly because it handles its religious themes with a intelligence and an even hand. This is NOT an action film - that is the mistake; the movie is a religious fable but not a heavy-handed fire-and-brimstone manner.<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as Eli, a man on a cross country mission in a post-apocolyptic America. People have resorted to cannibalism to survive. While Eli stops by a small relatively civilized town, he is confronted by the film's villain played by Gary Oldman who is the leader of the town. He has been searching the countryside, looking for a special book, the book that Eli has pledged to carry across the country. The film revolves around Eli's escape from the town, with a young girl in tow, and his journey across the country.<br /><br />So that is the basic plot. There is a "surprise" ending at the end, but there is more going on than just the basic plot. The power of faith, fake religious leaders, miracles and hope are themes that are explored in this film in a very intelligent and effective manner. The Book of Eli can appeal not on the Christians, but the ideas in this movie can speak to people of any faith - or no faith. Its a very positive movie.<br /><br />Its amazing that this movie was made, it really struck me on a deep emotional level. It will not be popular with the Pat Robertsons of the world due to its criticism of the misuse of religion. Some people will be far too jaded to accept this movie for what it is. I highly recommend this film to anyone; at least watch it once. I can't wait to see it again.</p></body></html>

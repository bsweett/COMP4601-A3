It does have some faults like a predictable ending but that didn't ruin it whatsoever for me. The movie could have had a better and unpredictable ending but everything else was almost perfect. Besides some confusing moments and the predictable ending, everything clicks right for this movie.<br /><br />The acting is superb, notably by Robin Williams, but also by Al Pacino and Hilary Swank. The visuals are gorgeous showing Alaskan landscapes. The score is perfect, and the plot is brilliant. I never saw the other version of this movie and didn't read the book (is it based on the book?) but loved this movie. The flashbacks were great as were the killer's phone calls.<br /><br />This movie had some faults but so do all movies and sometimes, these crazy plot twists at the end of movies seem really unrealistic and degrade the movie. This doesn't have a plot twist at the end because it didn't need one,and the predictable but neat ending didn't ruin the movie whatsoever.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is about 2 LA cops that come to Alaska to investigate a girl's murder. But Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) can't sleep because it's always light out there. And when an incident occurs that Dormer covers up by blaming the killer, things get complicated...because the killer saw him do it...<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie to everyone as it's a fascinating movie that will stick with you. I find it even worth a buy but if you want to see movies with plot twists or highly unpredictable endings, check out movies like Memento, The Usual Suspects, etc..</p></body></html>

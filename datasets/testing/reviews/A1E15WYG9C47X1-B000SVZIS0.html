A renewed cinematic reinterpretation? or as is the case of Tim Burton, as I suspect, a long life dream to pay hommage to a book/ film he greatly admires?<br />No matter what the reason is, it is surely a venture wrought with difficulties from the start. How many adaptations or remakes have succeeded more than the original? very few, even the ones that are adapted from a foreign film, and as a result don't have popular recognition, have invariably failed to capture the originality or power of the first film, whether the adaptation/remake is copied frame by frame,(Assasins, Vanilla Sky, Birdcage etc...) or 'inspired by'.<br />The original Planet of the Apes was certainly a classic masterpiece..A beautiful piece of moviemaking that has a lot to offer than mere entertainment.The film has has such an impact on audiences, and spawned many sequels and a TV series, that to remake it, even by an able and creative director like Tim Burton, will whether it is an actual remake or a different adaptation of Boulle's classic book, it will be associated with the original.<br />I could not watch this new version without thinking of the original, and this is why I did not appreciate it so much.<br />The casting is very good, and Walhberg is indeed a good actor, but Estella Warren was somehow miscast as the beautiful female 'savage' turned Walhberg side-kick.She is too distractingly beautiful and fresh to be her intended character, and I expected her, whenever she was in a close up to advertise for some shampoo or beauty product.<br />The make up is great though, and the DVD is packed with extras.<br />Yet something remains missing from the film. The sheer power and philosophical undertones, the harshness and apocalyptic atmosphere of the first.<br />Although Burton's ending of his film is quite clever, it remains somehow a bit polished to have the same power as the scene that confronted Heston and with him the viewers in the first Planet of Apes.<br />You can certainly still enjoy this film, only if you manage not to think of the original Planet of the Apes, something I found very hard to do, and for that reason I was disappointed, and hope that Hollywood, the movie industry and film makers would rethink their strategy and method whenever they remake or adapt a film that is a classic.(Dr Zhivago was recently remade for British TV and flopped instantly!)..and remember it is indeed extremely hard task.</p></body></html>

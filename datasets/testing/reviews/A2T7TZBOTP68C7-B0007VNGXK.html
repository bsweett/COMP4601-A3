<meta name="summary" content="Hellboy is a Helluva Movie"></head><body><p>Hellboy is one of the best action movies ever made. Hellboy contains lots of laughs and edge-of-your seat action. The effects are flawless. Ron Perlman carries the movie with his unusual and wonderful character. <p>Hellboy is a cat-loving son of Satan who is tough as hell but also tender hearted. The romance story in the movie was such that even guys will like it. (honest!) <p>Good versus evil is always a powerful theme when executed well. The story that even a demon can choose redemption lends an almost-new level to the genre, except that Spawn and Blade have already explored that idea.<p>Hellboy is a super hero for the ages. I do believe this will be an enduring classic.</p></body></html>

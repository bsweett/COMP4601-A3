<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Suprenacy"></head><body><p>It has been two years since we last saw Jason Bourne (Damon), and in that time he has been trying to live a &quot;normal&quot; life with his girlfriend Marie (Potente) in India. But quickly, two things go wrong for him. First, someone has killed a CIA agent and planted clues that point to Bourne as the murderer. Second, an assassin has arrived in India to kill him.<br /><br /> While dodging the assassin, he attempts to track down the CIA team that is after him. While the team leader, Pamela Landy (Allen) is new to the situation, Bourne's old boss, Ward Abbott (Cox) is also in the mix. What follows is basically a revenge movie filled with action and intense chase scenes. The final chase is expecially edge-of-your-seat cinema.<br /><br /> Almost all the cast and crew are back for the second installment of the Bourne series, and that provides a nice feeling of continuity. Certainly, the third novel in the series will be made into a movie, and hopefully the same continuity will be preserved with that one as well. Matt Damon once again is the surprising action hero, a role that one would not have thought possible of him a few years ago. Brian Cox is his usual delisiously evil self playing a character whose motives are unclear.<br /><br /> If you found &quot;The Bourne Identy&quot; entertaining, you will not be disappointed with &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;. It is a good, smart action movie that keeps you involved from beginning to end. Bring on &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;!</p></body></html>

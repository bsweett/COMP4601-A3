The premise of The Forgotten seems like its out of The X-Files territory. Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is in therapy trying to come to grips with the loss of her 9 year old son in a plane crash. Fourteen months have passed and she still feels his presence vividly expecting him to walk through the door. While visiting her therapist (Gary Sinise) she discusses her sense of loss and her inability to move on. Later, she discusses her son again and he tells her she never had one.<br />They never discussed him. That she's having a delusion and creating an imaginary son to help her deal with other issues. When she discusses this with her husband (Anthony Edwards) he echoes her psychiatrist; they never had a son. Suddenly, photos that she was familiar with featuring her son begin disappearing replaced with others featuring only her and the husband.<br /><br />Then how can her memories be so vivid? How can she still smell his hair, remember the texture of his skin, the color of his eyes, the day he first walked? How can she create a life that never was? There's no evidence he existed even the photos that she looked at the day before that had the three of them together now shows only Telly and her husband. Telly's conviction carries her on a search for her son that she knows in her heart exists. Telly discovers a series of frightening truths along this journey and that she doesn't need to take the journey alone.<br /><br />A disturbing suspense thriller that takes a number of unexpected twists and turns, The Forgotten has something that most thrillers lack-heart and soul. Julianne Moore's powerful performance anchors even the most incredible scenes in the movie. It's her performance that holds the film together even as it threatens to fly apart. With a strong, memorable supporting cast The Forgotten will stay with you as will the questions that it asks. If you're looking for a clearer solution to the story's mystery, I'd suggest watching the extended version that didn't play in theaters. It paints the conclusion with more solid colors although there's much that isn't explained. That's just as well as the best suspense thrillers always leave some loose ends. For those who want a  conclusion that's less clear cut, I'd suggest watching the theatrical cut. Both have their merits and both work extremely well but the inclusion of a couple of scenes might make the difference between accepting the conclusion of the film or not.<br /><br />As I mentioned previously the DVD sports two versions of the film and the extended cut with the alternate ending provides a great extra for fans that want to experience a slightly different version of the film. The extended ending really consists of one sequence that pushes home the conclusion of the film a bit more aggressively and leaves the conclusion a bit less nebulous than the theatrical cut. Both versions have their merits. We also get a short documentary on the making of the film beginning with the germ of the idea and how it occurred to writer Gerald DiPego and how he developed it to the involvement of Julianne Moore and director Joseph Ruben. Many of the behind-the-scenes production talent appear in this documentary discussing the development of the project. The featurette on the making of the film provides glimpses behind-the-scenes on the making of the film with sound bites featuring the main cast discussing their roles and what attracted them to the project in the first place. Both are done exceptionally well and make up for a lack of additional extras on the optical effects used for the film. We also get deleted scenes many of which did not end up in either version of the film.<br /><br />A gripping thriller that will have you guessing about the fate of the various characters in the film The Forgotten isn't likely to be a memory that'll fade away like an old photograph. The rich performances particularly by Julianne Moore, Gary Sinise, Anthony Edwards, Dominic West and Alfre Woodard ground the film in a sense of reality just as Telly's world appears to depart from it. Well directed with an intelligent script that doesn't take any short cuts, The Forgotten will linger with you like the memory of your first date or seeing the first steps your child takes. Some things can't be forgotten or taken away and the rich themes at the heart of this film will make that very clear. If you're someone looking for clear cut resolutions, you may want to watch the extended version and rent before buying. If it appeals to you, I guarantee you'll come back to it again and again. That might make it a worthwhile purchase for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AFI voted it a top 100 film &amp; Disney's Legacy is in this DVD"></head><body><p>The American Film Institute voted 2 of Walt Disney Films into the top 100 films in the last 100 years.  They are Snow White (1937) and Fantasia (1940).  Snow White even received Special Oscars from the Academy because of it groundbreaking achievements.  This was the first full length color (from the magnificent TECHNOCOLOR pallet) animated feature told as a dramatic fairy tale.  It was the first time people actually became emotionally attached to a &quot;Toon&quot;.  Our emotions were tested and we believed! Disney from this day forward would change all our lives and our childrens and childrens childrens for all generations to come.<br />This 2 DVD &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; (the first in a new elite series, the next one will be &quot;BEAUTY and the BEAST&quot; another one of my favorites) set of &quot;SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS&quot; is meticulously presented to us. And provides us with a perfectly digitally remastered print of this classic film (you'll be watching this one over and over.  It's such a great story!!!).  It is so detailed and colorful.  The story was flawlessly edited and presented in a fast pace, musically toe tapping emotional roller coaster ride format.<br />This DVD set will be educational and entertaining.  Disney Enterprises has now given us the magic and legacy of Walt Disney.  Hearing his voice on the Commentary Track and seeing him throughout his years spearheading this monumental mission of changing the world and making animated pictures respectable is just a peek at this DVD package.  There is also a dandy &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot; game to play. (So pay attention when watching Snow White&quot;.)<br />All in all this is one of the best assembled DVD sets ever and Disney gets 2 thumbs up for giving us not only the Greatest animated film ever (over 2 million hand drawn pictures &amp; 3 years to make) but all the archived details of Walt Disney work too.<br />So get ready to &quot;Whistle while you work&quot; through hours and hours of fun in watching &amp; listening to this milestone DVD set.  A must, a collectible.<br />Thank you Disney Enterprises for sharing Walt Disney's Legacy with us.</p></body></html>

If you know what you are going to see, in this case, you'll be better off because if you are expecting an action-packed historical adventure story, you will be bitterly disappointed.<br /><br />This is s-l-o-w moving, very slow, and fairly long at two hours and 15 minutes. If you enjoyed "The Girl With The Pearl Earring," you'll like this. Those two films are similar in beauty and pace.<br /><br />If you love good visuals, which I do, then this is a DVD you want to view. Terrence Malick has directed only four movies in 33 years and all four are beautifully filmed, the best being the second: "Days Of Heaven." I would rank this second to that film in terms of beauty.<br /><br />Cinematography-wise, there is a lot to like in The New World, especially the scenes on the water, which are magnificent. I wish there more of them. What we see is Jamestown, Va., in the year 1607, so this film is about as rural as you're ever going to see America.<br /><br />It's the story of Pocahontas (although she's never called that in the movie) and her relationship to two men: John Smith (Colin Farrell) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher plays the Indian girl who is given the Christian name "Rebecca" later in the film and this woman is mesmerizing throughout. What an innocently-interesting face!<br /><br />Without giving it away, the ending haunted me for a few days afterward. In the end, it is a powerful story, not just scene after scene of gorgeous photography (which it also is). There is more to this movie than the camera-work, but there is no doubt the cinematography is sitll the main attraction. This is a film crying out for a Blu-Ray presentation!</p></body></html>

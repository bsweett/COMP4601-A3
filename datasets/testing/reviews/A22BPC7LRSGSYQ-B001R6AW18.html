This is a black and white movie with very impressive special effects.  It stars Robert Armstrong, Bruce Cabot, and scream queen Fay Wray as Kong's female obsession.  This movie has it all - a giant ape, a good looking damsel in distress, a lost isle with dinosaurs and native inhabitants, and New York City.<br /><br />I like the 1976 remake, but nothing beats the original.  Haven't seen the 2005 Peter Jackson remake.  Some of the things I noticed about the 1933 movie is that Tyrannosaurus Rex walks completely upright.  This is the old school way of thinking.  In recent decades it has been suggested that T Rex probably walked hunched over, with its back pretty much parallel to the ground.  This shows how old this movie is, but at the same time it's fascinating to see this.  At times Kong appears two dimensional, but this is completely acceptable because this was 1933 technology.  Kong fights and kills several dinosaurs, including T Rex, a raptor, and a serpent-like creature.  The battle between Kong and T Rex is epic and goes on for quite some time.  You'll also see a Stegosaurus and a Brontosaurus, although Kong does not battle either one.  When Kong is brought to New York City, he escapes captivity and goes on a rampage.  The finale to the movie where Kong climbs to the top of the Empire State Building and battles biplanes that are shooting at him is classic.<br /><br />Compared to Jessica Lange in the 1976 version, Fay Wray is pretty much terrified of Kong for the whole movie, whereas Jessica Lange warmed up to him quite a bit.<br /><br />Special features of this DVD include audio commentary by Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston (visual effects) and interpolated interview excerpts of producer and director Merian C. Cooper and Fay Wray.  This movie has been restored and digitally mastered for a clear picture and sound.<br /><br />If you want to watch a classic monster/horror movie that is still well respected three quarters of a century after its release, then see the original King Kong.  I first saw it on TV when I was probably five years old and I still think its great.  So will you.</p></body></html>

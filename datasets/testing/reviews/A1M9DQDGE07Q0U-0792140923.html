<meta name="summary" content="GUMP IS AS GUMP DOES - THE EXTRAORDINARY FELLOW!"></head><body><p>"Forrest Gump" is the sweeping story of a simpleton (Tom Hanks) whose view of the world is both clairvoyant and poignant.  After being told that he will never walk without the aid of leg braces, young Forrest breaks free of his irons, goes on to become a college football star, a decorated war hero, the CEO of a lucrative shrimp business, and finally, a husband to the ill-fated girl of his dreams (Robin Wright Penn) and a father (Haley Joel Osmond in an early role). What makes the film so remarkable is its handling of the central character. Like Dustin Hoffman's Raymond, Tom Hanks brilliant performance as Forrest is thoughtful, introspective and fine wrought with compassion. Director, Robert Zemeckis never allows sympathy or stereotyping of the mentally handicap to override the poignancy or expanse of his narrative. Gary Sinise is magnificent as Lt. Dan Taylor - a hot shot military man until war robs him of the use of both of his legs. Sally Fields excels as Forrest's mother, a woman determined to see that her son lives a full and useful life.<p>The transfer from Paramount Home Video is somewhat disappointing. Sourced from a print rather than the original camera negative, colors are generally weak though sometimes nicely balanced. There's some age related dirt and scratches present throughout the print that, for a film of this vintage should NOT be an issue. The anamorphic framing is consistent but fine details are lost in many of the darker scenes. There's a considerable amount of film and digital grain present for a picture that, at times, is smooth, but at other times is rather harsh on the eyes. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced with a real kick in the musical score and special effects.  The extras include a documentary on the making of the film, some interviews with the cast members and director, the film's theatrical trailer and some television spots.  Overall, this is a less of a stellar visual presentation than it should have been.</p></body></html>

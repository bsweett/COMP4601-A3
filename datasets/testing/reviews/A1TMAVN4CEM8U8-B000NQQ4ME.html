It gets you tired just watching it.<br /><br />The movie is about a young Indio warrior Jaguar's<br />Paw who is captured by Mayan slavers, lead by El Jefe and<br />- has his pregnant wife abandoned in a pit,<br />- while Jaguar's Paw is taken to the great Mayan city to be sacrificed<br />- they pass a village that has apparently been ravaged by smallpox,<br />- and they pass an old fellow with some type of laughing sickness.<br /><br />Note:  Many scholars believe the Mayan Empire was devastated by some type of Biological hazard they just don't know which one.<br /><br />Back to the human sacrifices:<br /><br /> -first they cut out the heart<br /> -then they chop off the heads and throw them down the steps,<br /> Then they throw the headless body down the steps.<br />Just as the Mayans are getting ready to cut Jaguar's Paw `s heart out there is a solar eclipse.  This they interpret as the Sun God being satiated.  And they take the prisoners to the gauntlet to run for their life.  Fortunately Jaguar's<br />Paw gets to go in the second pair and quickly see that he needs to weave as he runs, thereby making himself a harder target.<br /><br />Well wouldn't you know that he almost makes it.  Jaguar<br /><br />Paw manages to kill El Jefe's son, the finisher, and makes it to the<br /><br />jungle. Jaguar's Paw successfully runs the gauntlet, escapes from a black<br /><br />jaguar(I didn't know there was such an animal, jumps over a giant<br /><br /> cataract, throws a hornets nest at his enemies, his wife has a baby in<br /><br /> the flooded pit, and then just when he can't run any more and collapses...<br /><br />You'll just have to watch the movie to see the ending.<br /><br />Well worth watching ,but it is very bloody.<br /><br />Gunner  July, 2007</p></body></html>

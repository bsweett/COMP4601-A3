<meta name="summary" content="nail-bitting and chilling"></head><body><p>Hailie is a smart charming 14 year old who should't be at the local dinner waiting for some 30 something year old man Jeff she met on the internet (raised eyebrows everyone). they start talking, she tells him of her love for Goldfrape and then she finds out Jeff's a photographer and wants to see his pictures. so they go to his house and they have a few drinks and then she says she wants him to take her picture. just when he's about to do so, he gets woozy and soon faints. he wakes up bound to a chair and we find out that she's not as innocent as she seems. she seems to know about his past and she seems to suspect him of kidnapping and killing a girl at her school and shes going to get the answer out of him using a scalple, a pair of scissors, and a medical book. the film has this sense of dread and creeps under your skin that makes this film supremly disturbing. the performences from the two actors are great but the stand out is Ellen Page who gives a chilling edge to our heroine and if the tide goes well, a guy named Oscar may be knocking on her door. so far, i rank Hard Candy up in my top ten of best films of 06, so i highly recommend this film for those who want to see a top notch thriller. warning though, one scene in perticular may cause you to keel over.</p></body></html>

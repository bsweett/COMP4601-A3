<meta name="summary" content="A DEVASTATINGLY BRUTAL HORROR FILM  9.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>When a film like the 2008 remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AV3BWM">Prom Night (Unrated)</a>, you have to wonder what exactly has happened with not just the horror genre, but with Hollywood films altogether. Prom Night was utterly terrible and is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. It wasn't scary, it wasn't gory like a slasher should be, and it was nothing more than a worthless, cliched mess. I generally didn't like many of the films that came out during the torture porn craze, and I believe that most torture porn films are an insult to the horror genre. I hated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a> and I really didn't care for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>. When horror films like High Tension and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTVU2">Wolf Creek (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a> come around from foreign filmmakers, they show us that we have forgotten what a horror film should be like. Raw, unnerving, scary, bone-chilling, and they rattle you to the core. That is how a horror film should be.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When two college friends; Marie and Alex decide to spend a weekend with Alex's parents to study and relax, the most unthinkable happens. A mysterious stranger pays a visit to the farmhouse, kills Alex's family, and takes the girls as his prisoners. This may seem like simple storyline, but as it unravels, it will throw curveballs that not even the most hardened horror fanatic can predict, and I was very surprised and left going, "What the f***?"<br />MUSIC: This film's music does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it does set the mood and atmosphere quite well.<br />ACTION: This film is extremely violent and gory. In fact, when it came over here to the U.S. from France in 2005, it received an NC-17 rating (The highest MPAA rating possible) and Lionsgate had to tone it down to an R-rating. Thankfully, this Unrated version leaves every bit of horror goodness intact and uncensored. The film is very gory, to the point of shocking and disturbing on every level. This film is also pretty damn scary and will leave you on edge, and like any horror film is supposed to be, it is very unpredictable. Definitely not for the faint of heart.<br />ACTING: Now remember, if you are considering to purchase this film, please only watch Original French Director's Cut. I've heard far too many ramblings that the English voice-overs are terrible, and anyone who knows me, knows that I refuse to watch a film with English dubbing if it's foreign, and that I prefer to leave it in its original language. If you watch the original French version, the actors are fantastic and perform their roles extremely well, and they do make you believe that they are terrified. If you watch it with English dubbing, most people will tell you that it sucks. Any film with bad English dubbing is bound to be ruined, unless you watch the original version. Overall, I have no gripes with this area.<br />OVERALL: Tired of the usual crappy Hollywood horror flicks? Then buy High Tension, dammit! This film has gone down as an instant horror classic that is not afraid to be brutal and unnerving in every way possible. It will rattle you to the core and you will not know what's coming next.<br />THE GOOD: Great acting, good music, truly terrifying, unpredictable, and devastatingly brutal in every way.<br />THE BAD: Terrible English dubbing (Only watch the French Director's Cut!) and some moments of odd dialogue.</p></body></html>

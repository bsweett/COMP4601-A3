It was a little disappointing to me but I gave it an even rating because I thought its production design was incredible. It is a great movie to look at. The technology and the promise of a future where we survive, make this an interesting film. This movie was far more interesting that his last project AI. Just to put things in perspective &#65533; my favorite Spielberg films are (and they are in no order), Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E.T. Schindler&#65533;s List, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Always and Saving Private Ryan.<p>Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. Not much of a stretch for him and not of lot of originality. (He was much better in Risky Business and All The Right Moves.) All the other supporting cast we kind of flat, but again, the technology was incredible. Display screens, holograms, electronic spiders and ore.<p>Basically the premise is that three people using telepathy can predict murders and the murderers &#65533; before they kill. They are then arrested and put in hibernation. The problem is that Tom&#65533;s character learns info that starts this race against time.<p>The most interesting character and the most dynamic performer came from Lois Smith. She played the inventor of the software and system that allows the psychics to do what they do. She seemed to have a lot of fun with Tom.<p>This is a matinee type of film or wait for the video release &#65533; but the production design is what stands out. Take a chance if you have nothing better to do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Simply Another Pixar Masterpiece!"></head><body><p>First let me say: Toy Story 3 is another Pixar masterpiece and the perfect way to close a franchise started in 1995. Randy Newman's "You've got a friend in me" warms the heart today as it first did 15 years ago.<br /><br />Now with that out of the way let me call attention to the films lead-in...<br /><br /> Pixar continues another tradition here with is the animated short that precedes the feature (like Luxo Jr. where the Studio's logo comes from). Toy Story 3's short is called "Day & Night" and raises the bar for future Pixar shorts and will likely get many Academy nomination for it's efforts.  I think the 3-D may work more effectively with the short than the sequel itself. "Day & Night" is more complicated a concept than you'd expect considering it involves two mute characters struggling to coexist. One character consists, literally of daytime images while his counterpart is made of night images.  Although the two characters are little more than retro-cartoon silhouettes, they are filled with complex animated scenes within their own animation. They shift positions and move around one another creating some fascinating visuals for us. Equally simple is it's message for  folks to overcome their fear of the  differences in others and the unknown. Day & Night is simply the best short I've seen from Pixar to date<br /><br />Now with that out of the way, Toy Story 3 reunites us with old friends: Woody, Buzz, Jesse, Hamm, Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, each voiced by their original actors (except the late Jim Varney). Surprisingly, the Toys owner Andy, now grown up and ready to start college is still voiced by the same actor John Morris (who started at around 11 in the first film).  It seems the concept of toys coming to life when people aren't look would become tired after 2 films, but I have to say that is not the case here. After a super opening sequence, an homage to Woody's opening adventure in the original film, the toys end up at Daycare run like a prison by a naughty Teddy Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). Naturally the Toys want to escape; the break-out plan doesn't go quite as planned by makes for some funny tributes to the prison movie genre (including a harmonica playin' Hamm). More classic toys turn up like the old Fisher-Price rolling phone and cymbal-monkey as an ever watchful prison guard. Barbie's Ken even turns up voiced gloriously campy by Michael Keaton, definitely emerging as the film's breakout toy characterization. The visuals are more amazing than ever, the humans look so much better than the original, it may become difficult to watch those older sequences after seeing "3."  Lot's of details sweep across the screen with everything from the Pizza Planet " Yo" truck, to all the texture of Ken's extensively stocked accessory  collection (Groovy).  But technical strides aside, on an emotional level the movie, like those before it, generate plenty of concern for the wellbeing of these CGI toys, again. I would go as far to say if you are not touched by the final moments of the film and Andy's goodbye, then you may want to get to a cardiologist and get yourself checked out!</p></body></html>

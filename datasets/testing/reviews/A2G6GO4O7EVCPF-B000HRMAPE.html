When Hunt's friend John, played by Billy Crudup (Almost Famous, Stage Beauty) tells him that one of the people that he used to work with named Lindsey Ferris, played by Keri Russell (Felicity, Upside of Anger) is missing, Hunt goes off to rescue her with his team including Luthor, played by Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction, Kojak), Declan played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Match Point, Velvet Goldmine) and Zhen played by Maggie Q (Taped, Rush Hour 2). Hunt and his team even track down to find bad guy Owen Davian, played superbly by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote, Happiness). Things happen when Hunt kidnaps Owen and things go completely haywire when Owen kidnaps Hunt's wife Julia and he demands Hunt find the Rabbit's Foot otherwise his wife dies. The opening scene is surely a grabber..well that's JJ Abrams for you who directs this action packed movie which is better then the first two. The first one is still good but John Woo screwed the second one up. This felt like Alias and it has refrences to Lost (scene where Michelle Monagahn pounds on Ethan Hunts chest echoes the scene in which character Jack tries hard to revive Charlie while pounding on his chest). The action scenes are pretty inventive as well...especially the highway road scene with the jet flying all around and the scene in where Hoffman and Cruise duke it out at the end. Hoffman was only in the beginning, the middle and the end but his character has to be one of the best villains in this kind of genre in a long time. The supporting actors such as Rhames, Crudup and Meyers are very good. Also starring Laurence Fishburne (Matrix Trilogy, Mystic River), Greg Grunberg (Alias, Ladykillers) and the hilarious Simon Pegg (Spaced, Shaun of the Dead).</p></body></html>

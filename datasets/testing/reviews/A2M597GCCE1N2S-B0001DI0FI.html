<meta name="summary" content="One rousing action tale...."></head><body><p>Master and Commander, The Far Side of the World, is the story of action and adventure, tough choices to be made, and a man's quest to end the threat of the high seas by any means necessary, whatever the cost may be.<br /><br />Russel Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, known to his sailors and fellow ship officers as "Lucky" for his relative luck in the face of battle. One example would have to be a bank of fog that his ship retreats into after being ambushed by a french ship during the time of war.<br /><br />The year is 1804, and France and England are at war as Napolean is conquering Europe one country after another. Only England's fleet of warships stands in Napoleans way of ruling the seas, so the tensions and battles at sea between different ships is at an all time high. Aubrey has been given the command to sink or capture a French ship named the Acheron, before it sinks any British ships.<br /><br />The whole story isn't just about playing a cat and mouse game between Aubrey and the French captain. Aubrey's crew start to wonder if the French ship is some type of phantom ship after numerous sneak attacks lead them to question if there is a curse on one of the sailors, like the famous story of Jonah. Aubrey must keep control of the ship but at the same time he still needs time to keep the men happy at the same time.<br /><br />There are also several other small stories in this movie, from the ship reaching the Galapagos islands and all the men looking at the strange creatures they never saw in their lives, to a storm at sea and a man being washed overboard, some great action scenes with just mother nature pounding on the ship. There's even a scene where the crew builds a floating device that reseambles a ship at nighttime to lure the french phantom ship away after yet another sneak attack.<br /><br />We don't see much of the French crew during the movie, and 95% of the story takes place on the British ship. However you do see the respect Aubrey has for the French captain, and he is determined to prove he is better of the two during their chasing games back and forth as both ships manage to get behind the other during several ambush attacks.<br /><br />The acting is superb, especially by Russel Crowe and the ship's doctor. The action scenes during the cannon fights and the climactic ending battle are well worth checking out. Emotional near the ending as men die for what they fought to protect, both on the French and British side.<br /><br />The extras have:<br /><br />Some behind the scenes shots of the movie and subtitles in English and Spanish. The ending of the story itself has a twist near the end, see if you can spot it before the characters in the story unveil the truth. Highly Reccomended.</p></body></html>

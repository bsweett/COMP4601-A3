<meta name="summary" content="Nazi Exploitation."></head><body><p>_Inglourious Basterds_ (2009) is perhaps Quentin Tarantino's most bizarre film.  The film effectively shows that there is no bigger industry than "Nazi exploitation".  From Godwin's law to Schindler's List, it seems that Hitler and his cronies are the perennial topic of conversation for all right-thinking people.  It is difficult to say overall whether this film is a spoof or not.  The film features a group of "Basterds" led by an Apache Indian and some Jews whose job it is to go around scalping Nazis.  The film focuses on the misadventures of the "detective" Jew hunter SS man, as he attempts to prevent a plot by the Basterds to destroy the Nazis.  Ultimately, the detective comes across as such a despicable character in the film that you are glad he deserves his ultimate fate.  The ending is exceedingly strange.  Not historically correct.  And the message seems to be that every "living" "Nazi" needs a Charles Manson type swastika engraved in their head, because a "Nazi is always a Nazi". When will we forget?  2.5 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I feel bad for David Fincher"></head><body><p>This was David Fincher's first movie, and it's never listed in his fimographies on DVD special features, because he disowned it and walked out on post production.  It's sad.  That's the first event where Fox started to become the controlling greedy machine that it is now.  They do make the best movies, don't get me wrong, but the way they pushed David Fincher around was wrong.  He never had the whole script on the set at one time and a butchered version of the movie was released in theatres in 1992, but now the original vision is available for the first time.  It's the complete version of Alien 3 that was ment to be.  It's too bad about the audio for alot of the deleted scenes though.  The voices are all washed out.  I'm sorry, David Fincher, maybe some day you'll let someone interview you about the movie, because us fans would really like to here it from the director instead of anyone but.</p></body></html>

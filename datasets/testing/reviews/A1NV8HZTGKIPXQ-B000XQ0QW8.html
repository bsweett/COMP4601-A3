While this film does not even come close to the brilliance of &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, it does hold it's own by itself. Bruce Willis stars as a family man whose marriage on the rocks. On a trip home on a train, the train is involved in a horrible accident. Everyone on board dies....except Willis. There's not a single scratch on him. He then begins to realize that he's never been sick, or has ever been really hurt. His son thinks he's some kind of superhero. Enter Samuel L. Jackson. He plays a comic book collector with a rare bone disease. His character tries to tell Bruce that he is indeed a superhero. I won't tell you what happens. You'll have to see for yourself. Shyamalan delivers the moddy colors and haunting shots like in &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;. They work here as well. Jackson is really good in his role. Willis is really starting to become a 'real' actor. Everybody always thought he was some dimbulb action star. How wrong those people are. He is solid here. This movie is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. You'll either love it or absolutely hate it. You just have to remember one thing : It's just a movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good story, with one big flaw..."></head><body><p>First off, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the computer graphics, I enjoyed the irony, I even enjoyed the wolves.  And if you know a little something about some of the science you can enjoy it too.  The only problem I had was the time scale - everything was happening too fast.  The Ice Age could take centuries (or even just a few decades), but its going to take longer than a few weeks.<br />A change in the Gulf Stream's direction, either switching farther north or south, could trigger an Ice Age for different reasons.  But an Ice Age could also be caused by changes in solar output from the sun, lets say by a passing cloud of space dust.  So to me that was believable.  IT would cause changes in weather and we would have tough winters.  REALLY bad many-people-die-in-their-homes winters BUT New York City has HAD such winters and they didn't have packs of wolves and tidal waves to go with them.<br />One irony is that during the making of the film an ice shelf DID break off (just like at the start of the film).  But scientists knew it was going to do that within the next 13 years or so anyway, so no big deal.  No huge storms.  Yet.<br />A mammoth WAS flash frozen.  It was found with food still lodged between its teeth and was in reasonable good health at death as it had a layer of fat under its hairy hide.  There was little or no decay due to the fact that the bacteria had also been killed.  So the massive storms that froze everything and everybody within seconds MIGHT have existed DURING the Ice Ages.  Let me repeat that last part - during the Ice Age, as in, the Ice Age had been around for a couple hundred years ALREADY.<br />I enjoyed it very much, but I made sure I knew the difference between theories, facts and Hollywood magic.  And some of that might still be wrong to boot.<br />Oh, and one spoiler, the dog who was owned by the street person lived.  Just in case you were worried about the poor thing.</p></body></html>

In all fairness, the first 30-40minutes of this film were solid stretches of funny, though once a need to focus on a plot emerged, the humor became watered down in the development.  The general satire of the racing (and general sports) world and celebrity life were amusing, but for the most part, about halfway through the jokes started to become rehashed and any wit was lost.</p></body></html>

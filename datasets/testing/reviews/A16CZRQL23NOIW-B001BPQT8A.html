<meta name="summary" content="The hell is in your mind!"></head><body><p>When the sins are committed from two in two you have to pay them from one in one; Rudyard Kipling was the author of this singular statement. This film became the great leap of David Fincher to the big screen. Original script that deals with a serious damaged mental  man, who bets to be God and choosing every victim according every one of those kidnapped codes. But beware the religious fanatic  can become heretics due precisely, to his own fanaticism.<br /><br />Seven capital sins: seven crimes that must be done to clean the world from the stinkers and vicious human beings. In this chrysalis and under those extreme prejudices you can not expect too much sense of the reality. And Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt will be the investigators who will be assigned to chase this lunatic and out of his mind man. Excellent shots, brutal and extremely graphic violence, but superbly fascinating.<br /><br />One of the most original and best films in these decade.<br /><br />The plot was a true circular nightmare as it was inspired by the astonishing mind of Jorge Luis Borges or perhaps a sincere homage to William Blake!</p></body></html>

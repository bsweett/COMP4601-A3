<meta name="summary" content="Near Perfect Comedy"></head><body><p>I don't think anyone can say there was ONE unfunny sequence in the entire first 40 minutes or so of Office Space. The only real problem I have though with this cult classic is Jennifer Aniston, the film is about office drones being miserable and eventually planning revenge, what did some hackneyed love story have to do with it? Did anyone feel ANYthing for that relationship? It wasn't really funny when they talked together, it didn't really end on a romantically satisfying note, the whole point of that sub-plot seemed to be to market Office Space to the vast number of Friends fans at the time.<br /><br />Oh well, Office Space is still one of the best comedies made, just a minor complaint.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By!""></head><body><p>This is such a classic tale of love, heroism and self denial. It is a wonderfully constructed story of love and a tribute to the golden age of fine acting when beauty wasn't measured by exposed skin or sleazy performance.<br /><br />This is a must have classic, if not for the story, the performance, or the music, then for the love theme:<br />"You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply<br />As time goes by, and when two lovers woo, they still say, "I love you", on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Epic, Flawed Gangs Needs Big Screen"></head><body><p>The 168 minute GANGS OF NEW YORK is a huge epic combining fiction and fictional characters with a few historical ones (Boss Tweed, Horace Greely), real places and events (the 1863 Draft Riots) with tall tales, and legends all being driven by a simplistic story of revenge. It's  a flawed, depressing film, filled with brutality and bigotry.  It contains brilliant sequences and memorable acting and should be seen on the big screen.<p>The film has a lesson to share about progress --what it is, what it means, and how little progress has taken place in the last few hundred years.  The U.S. definition of progress has always been one fueled by money and greed that says the ends justify the means-even means that include murder, and racial cleansing.  Time and some whitewashing will cause unpleasant historic events to fade away.  GANGS OF NEW YORK pretends to be the warts and all history.  It's science fiction actually, or as Scorcese has said: "it's like a western only set on Mars." <p>Martin Scorcese last indulged himself in the works of Italian filmmakers, particularly the neo-realists to create one of the best documentaries on film you'll ever see, MY VOYAGE TO ITALY.  The influence of him revisiting the films that made him fall in love with film in the first place is evident all over GANGS OF NEW YORK.  He has borrowed from the Neo-Realists he loves, and also from David Lean, Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, Fellini, Goddard and others to create homages to the filmmakers he loves .<br /><br />The film has among the best production design work you're ever likely to see.  It seems no detail, no matter how small has been overlooked or short changed. Fingernails are dirty, teeth are not always white, several characters have greasy unkempt hair. The costumes, props, set dressings, the infamous jar of ears...great stuff.  Huge sets were built to allow for big wide shots that one rarely sees in period films. We see a coach spraying people to help fight lice and cholera, neighborhood fire companies brawl with each other letting an apartment house burn and then raid the building next door for goods before it burns down.  A theater production of Uncle Tom's Cabin is created, complete with a levitating Abe Lincoln character.  These are all-memorable and colorfully realized sequences showing us another world, another life we have never seen before.<br /><br />One of the most glaring flaws is how the period feel established right from the start of the film is temporarily derailed when a modern driving film score music is used in the first battle scene. Perhaps we're dealing with a concession, a battle that Scorcese lost with Harvey Weinstein-but I doubt it, it could be the work of Howard Shore or Robbie Robertson we are seeing.  <p>The best reason for seeing the film is to witness one of the most colorful, riveting and daring performance you're ever likely to witness. Daniel Day Lewis delivers the kind of performance people will talk about for decades. It's a balanced tight-rope without a net performance, but Daniel Day Lewis never falls or conjures up a safety rope of camp or self parody.  Daniel Day Lewis' exaggerated way of walking for example is about his character navigating along sometimes slippery and muddy streets with fancier shoes than he should be wearing and not a ham actor's affectation.  His energy allows us to enjoy being in the presence of malevolence and so makes the character believable as a powerful leader.  The trust that both Scorcese and Day-Lewis must have had for each other is remarkable-it's the kind that allowed DeNiro to create his Travis Bickle (Taxi-Driver), Jake LaMotta  (Raging Bull) and Rupert Pupkin (King of Comedy) for Scorcese two decades ago.  You can also be assured Scorcese is not softening or playing it too safe when you see this performance.<p>Leonard DeCaprio doesn't ruin the film by not being in the same league as the other actors.  The rest of the cast treat him as if he is their equal and so he fades into an every man kind of blandness.  His character should be intense and full of confidence and resourfulness.  Since he spent 16 years in a tough reformatory he should be hard and cunning, perhaps bitter and cold.  Instead DeCaprio seems na?ve, innocent and too frail and angelic to witness the cruelty and brutality he sees constantly.  One thing that drove me crazy is how DeCaprio's Amsterdam, often looks away from unpleasant things.  His father had told him to NEVER look away.  Yet, he is constantly looking away and Scorcese lets him without using it to make a point. It's hard to empathize with someone you want to slap. Johnny Depp would have been a better choice.<br /><br /> Cameron Diaz has taken on a role that could have been particularly thankless.  She doesn't let DeCaprio drag her down into blandness, but allows her energy and spark to reflect effectively off of him.  She is the only strong female character in the entire film.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting characters are colorful scalawags for the most part and played by interesting actors who have big voices and charisma to burn..  Jim Broadbent is positively Shakespearean in his portrayal of  Boss Tweed  a powerful political force (and based on a real historical character).  Liam Neeson isn't around for too long, but makes the lasting impression he needs to.  John C. Reilly and especially Brendon Gleeson are perfectly cast and know when less is more. Few actors seem to understand their charisma and use it as flawlessly as Gleeson does.  <p>--Christopher J. Jarmick co-wrote the critically acclaimed The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder.

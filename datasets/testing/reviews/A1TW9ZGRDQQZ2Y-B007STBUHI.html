<meta name="summary" content="JAWS DVD"></head><body><p>I just bought this DVD yesturday and I am very impressed. The picture and sound quality are unmatched. There is tons of extras that will keep you  busy for hours. The only complaint that I found was that there should have  been some more outtakes, but thats just a little gripe. The movie is a  timeless horror/thriller tale about a 25 foot hungry shark that feeds on  local swimmers on the beach. If you own a DVD this is a must to your  collection. After viewing this film you will think twice about swimming in  the ocean. Buy it now!</p></body></html>

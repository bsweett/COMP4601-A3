This follow-up to Toy Story 2 is wonderful.The casting is superb, with John Goodman as Sulley, and Billy Crystal as Mike, his assistant, drawing attention here. The animation shows true progression, with one being able to see each strand of fur separately, if you can look that closely. The story line and set pieces are masterpieces of imagination. Whoever thought this whole thing up should have gotten a very large raise. The story arcs nicely, with the viewer getting attached to Boo, the little human girl, as Sulley does. It does tend to drag just a bit in the middle, but the final third is fantastic. The final scene is pure magic. Overall, this stands as one of Pixar's very best, which, considering Pixar's track record, is saying a lot.</p></body></html>

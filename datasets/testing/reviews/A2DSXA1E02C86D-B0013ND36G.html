<meta name="summary" content="Arnie drives a hearse"></head><body><p>Since I haven't seen the previous two &quot;Terminator&quot; films, watching TERMINATOR 3 was like coming into a movie already half over. I'm sure I've missed something. However, ignorance hasn't stopped me before from being rashly opinionated.<p>The gist of the ongoing series is that machines and humans will be at war with each other in the near future, at which time beleaguered Mankind is to be led by John Connor and his wife, the former Kate Brewster. In the &quot;now&quot; of this film, machines are about to launch a nuclear first strike against humanity using America's computerized and newly automated national defense system. The good news is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator robot sent back in time to ensure that Connor (Nick Stahl) and Brewster (Claire Danes) survive the coming Armageddon to fight on. The bad news is that a more advanced Terminator robot, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back by the other side to eliminate the same Connor and Brewster. All the action revolves around the collision between the two hard-nosed androids.<p>At the risk of throwing a wet blanket of logic on the storyline, wouldn't a Nuclear Winter visited upon the planet by vengeful machines also destroy the very technology and industrial infrastructure capable of creating the advanced robots supposed to carry the battle into the future? Never mind; this is a Tinseltown fairy tale.<p>The two best reasons to see TERMINATOR 3 are Arnie, of course, who delivers some straight-faced gag lines that'll leave you chortling, and one of the best vehicle chases I've seen recently. The latter ostensibly takes place in Los Angeles, and, if not accomplished with models and computer generated FX, left me surprised that the city is still standing. Otherwise, the special FX technology used to depict the warring robots is pretty much old hat to those of us getting jaded.<p>The Connor and Brewster characters left me completely cold. As a matter of fact, they were both so annoying that I hoped in the depths of my perverse heart that the T-X would manage to slaughter them both. I mean, do we really need them for a TERMINATOR 4? <p>Loken's T-X might just as well have been a high-tech wind-up doll, though she was impressively poker-faced and relentless in pursuit of her programmed objective. The scene where &quot;she&quot; gets stuck to a giant magnet was inspired. And the one-on-one fight scenes with Arnie were so violent that I thought they'd make the perfect 21st century version of the Bickersons.</p></body></html>

Chris Evans is a great hero figure and the female (Hailey ____) is stunningly beautiful and lights up the screen every time she appears. The action sequences are well done and Hugo Weaving plays a menacing villian. This has all the components of a great comic hero film and it delivers in my opinion. To be frank, I think the music score could have been more influencial in the film and is somewhat lacking in "bigness" for this type of movie. I saw the 3D version in theaters and I actually prefer the traditional 2D of the blu-ray. This is a great addition to the Marvel Comics films and I'm hoping for a sequel besides "The Avengers", which looks very promising!</p></body></html>

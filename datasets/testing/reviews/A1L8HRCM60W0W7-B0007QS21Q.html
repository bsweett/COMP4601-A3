<meta name="summary" content="THE PROBLEM WITH THIS OTHERWISE WELL MADE MOVIE..."></head><body><p>...is that it just doesn't have enough characters. With such a cut and dry theme -- machines taking over, etc etc -- it is imperative to maintain a modicum of realism.<br /><br />While the well-made film offers a delectable blend of CGI and some mild humour along with an unexpected twist, it fails miserably by providing only one hero (and his generic love interest from the lab) who single-handedly saves the day against hordes of robots that crawl out of the woodwork to supposedly take a city under their reins.<br /><br />Wouldn't a real city call for armies or some such well trained forces into action? The end result here is thus too ludicrous to be enjoyable as Will Smith squishes all the machinery to glory all on his own.<br /><br />Watchable rental if you're really into science fiction or a major Smith buff, otherwise a fairly immemorable summer flick.</p></body></html>

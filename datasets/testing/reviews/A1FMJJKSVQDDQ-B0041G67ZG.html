<meta name="summary" content="Good performances by Kidman and Penn, but something is missing here"></head><body><p>I really wanted to love this movie. I really did. I am a big fan of political thrillers, but this one.....something is missing here. First off, I will admit that Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman give good performances. They're very convincing in their respective roles. The dialogue is sharp, I'll also give credit to that. But then, their chemistry is very uninteresting. It's almost the weakest element in the film. But it's not: the weakest part of The Interpreter is the lack of tension throughout the film. Usually, with such a fascinating plot, there would be plenty of suspense between the protagonists and the unknown force that's binding the story (in other words, the unknown antagonist). But there's hardly any tension, and that's mostly because the chemistry between Kidman and Penn's characters mostly get in the way. Just when you think that the story would progress, then in comes the the scenes involving the two characters' friendship. And then, there's the ending, which was relatively predictable.<br /><br />The Interpreter isn't really that bad, but it's not great, either. The film is marred by lack of suspense, unnecessary chemistry between Penn and Kidman, and a fairly predictable ending. Our two actors give very nice performances, though, and if you're a fan of either of them, you MIGHT feel satisfied with this movie.<br /><br />Grade: 5.4 out of 10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Action Film"></head><body><p>Having just looked up when he was born and when the film was made, I can go ahead with what I was going to lead off with; that Michael Douglas looked his age and that fit the part he played, a very senior secret service agent. Perhaps he looked too old for all that running around but, then, those guys do keep in good shape.<br />Oh, yes, as to the picture. I liked it. It was a good action picture by a competent group of actors and a director who knew that one of the secrets of using a hackneyed plot, as most film plots are, is to keep up a fast pace so that people don't have slow stretches in which they might start thinking of all the holes you are trying to paper over. Douglas handles himself as the old pro he is as do the other younger pros. I suppose, before we learned what  some Presidents have been doing in the White House (and, presumably, at other locations) it might have seemed a bit of a stretch to have the First Lady involved; now, of course, I shouldn't think it raised even a flicker of "oh, that could never happen".<br />So, not much to say that is not reported in the description of the film and the previous reviewers remarks. There is more than enough to grab and hold your attention until the end without any depressing thoughts about reality to jar your involvement.<br />Now its two years later and I have just seen the DVD again. Funny thing: I had already framed the same response I gave originally. I suppose that means something about the film and/or me.</p></body></html>

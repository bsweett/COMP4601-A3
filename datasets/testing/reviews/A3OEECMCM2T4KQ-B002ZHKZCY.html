<meta name="summary" content="A  Worthy Sequel"></head><body><p>Sequels do not always pan out. As many people would agree, riding on the back of a box office hit is usually an effort to make more cash, and as a result, the quality of the sequel reflects this. Not so with The Bourne Supremacy. In many ways it's better than the first, in terms of tight editing, Damon's overall performance, and that over the top car chase through the streets of Moscow, at the end of the film, which had me gripping the arm rests of my seat.<br /><br />Matt Damon was recently here in Melbourne promoting the film and he worked hard, appearing on every major Australian talk show as well as several popular morning radio stations. Australians like Matt Damon because he comes across as honest, no pretenses, your average all-American clean cut young man. In fact I remember him saying in one of his interviews that he was hesitant to do the sequel because he was afraid the quality of the film would suffer, but he ended up agreeing to do the project when he found out who would be directing. Paul Greengrass did a fine job, as the realism of the picture is first rate. Originally a documentary filmmaker, he brought his sense of realism to the project. Some have commented that the editing was too tight, jagged in places, almost acting as a distraction. Perhaps this is true in places, but generally, in my opinion, the editing was a work of art - well timed and realistic.<br /><br />This is a great action film sequel that in some cases surpassed the original.<br /><br />A strong four and a half stars.</p></body></html>

Let's face it there are pretty much two camps of thought. Those that saw the original years ago and set their SciFi intellectual standard by it. Then there are those that may or may not have seen the original, but even if they did, to them it's an old B&W movie that is to brainy or quaint. I have been a long time fan of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>. I thought no way Keenu Reeves as Klaatu, let alone it being a remake could it be as good. I have to say that it is a good try. The original may have a slight edge because of the masterful Thermin music composed by Bernard Herrmann, a lot more common people had dialogue with Klaatu, and he had more time with the scientist. That all said they did a very impressive job on the remake and the whole cast did a great job. Michael Rennie was not exactly an animated actor either so Reeves does a good job in the part of Klaatu. Furthermore we should not expect this to be a carbon copy of the original.<br /><br />I prefer when remakes follow a different path. That's why I enjoyed the remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016Q2D5M">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>. In this version, on purpose or not, Klaatu is colder. Actually perhaps a more realistic attitude considering what he is here to do. Consider the fact this is 2009 and not 1951, and the way military and government personnel will react, is NOT going to be the same. So if you wanted this movie to be a cc of the first one you WILL be disappointed. I didn't want that and I didn't get that and I'm grateful. Gort is as scary as he was in the first movie as well, and that took some doing considering how impressive special effects have become over the last fifty years. They made him much larger and of more of a biological composition this time. Overall I have every intention of buying this good SciFi movie because it far exceeded my expectations thanks to the critics. It may not be as cerebral as the orginal, but it makes up for quite a bit in the woman and kid interaction with Klaatu, the conversation with the scientist (nicely played by John Cleese), the conversation with a fellow alien (emotionally played by James Hong), and the special effects.<br /><br />Good quality DVD with decent replayability. I think it will grow on most people after it has been out for awhile. I give it three and a half stars. I will grant you had they cut back on the effects a little and extended the conversations with Cleese and Hong it would have made me happier, but probably not the F/X fans. My only complaint about this three disc set is they did not include extras for the original movie. It comes with plenty of extras for the new Blu ray version and even a digital copy you can put on your PC. The third disc is the Blu ray of the original movie and it is extremely sharp and clear, but I had hoped to get all the extras I got with the special edition I bought a few years ago including a documentary with Robert Wise. It doesn't even include the trailer. It is a bare bones play, scenes, setup version.

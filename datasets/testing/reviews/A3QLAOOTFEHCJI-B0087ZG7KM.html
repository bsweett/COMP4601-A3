<meta name="summary" content="One of the funniest movies of 2011"></head><body><p>SNL alum Kristen Wiig co-wrote and stars in this raunchy comedy all about the ladies.  Much has been made of the fact that this film is for the girls what the celebrated Judd Apatow movies are for the boys.  It's true.  In fact Apatow is a producer.  While there is plenty of in-your-face humor related to sex and bathroom mishaps, the best stuff is more subtle and will produce chuckles rather than guffaws.  In fact, the two 20 year old dudes sitting behind me at a theater viewing clearly didn't get the jokes.  Wiig is terrific as the best friend of the bride (Maya Rudolph) who has found a new friend who wants to control everything.  She's played by Rose Byrne as you've never seen here before...damn funny.  While everyone has their moments, the best character is chubby Megan, the sister of the groom and played with great vigor by Melissa McCarthy.  I could have done without the vomit and diarrhea scene as the ladies were trying on dresses, but hell I was laughing.  While the movie is no doubt a comedy, there is some touching moments when Annie (Wiig) hits the bottom.  The movie should also be noted for being Jill Clayburgh's last film.  She plays Annie's mom.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Meh..."></head><body><p>Yeah... The first two Spider-Man movies were decent, I wouldn't own them, but they were decent. I'd put them on if they happened to be on TV and there wasn't anything else on. But... This one? Spider-Man 3? I wouldn't even put it on TV, I wouldn't even give it a second glance. For one, they completely and totally messed up Venom, and you do NOT mess up one of the most popular Spider-Man characters of all time! And, I thought there was too much drama in this one, I really didn't give a crap if Mary-Jane broke up with Peter/Spider-Man or not, it just seemed stupid to me. There wasn't enough action (except at the very end). And, I didn't like how they tried to use three villains at once. Two villains? Go for it! Three? Seems like too much. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A woman like Jessica Biel and a guy like Nick Cage? I don't think so."></head><body><p>No matter how well this plot might have been (and I must admit, it was strangely intoxicating), there is one undeniable truth that resonates from this film like the white, thick puss from a zit, and that is the fact that a guy who looks like Nicholas Cage, receding hairline and 44 years worth of aging and ape-like facial difficulties to deal with, and a gal like Miss Biel, 26 years old and quite possibly the most beautiful actress under the age of 30, would never, never, never hook up within their first six lifetimes of living together, let alone their first day together as this film tries to sell us on (I know, this is the longest run-on sentence in Amazon history). Only in Hollywood, people, only in Hollywood.<br /><br />Think about it. The film spins Cage's character's advances in a funny way, but to propose that he would have a one in a billion chance with a woman so stunning was enough for me to discount anything else the film tried to peddle. I could see them becoming friends, I could see them becoming good friends, but getting their groove on within the first half-day of meeting? PaaLEASE! No way does that happen in reality. Never.<br /><br />Gary Goldman, the man responsible for writing the main portions of the screenplay, is the guilty party here. He just had to take a very well-made film and throw the most unbelievable romantic plot development since Elisabeth Shue's character going for Cage in Leaving Las Vegas (I know, I'm not very nice to Cage).<br /><br />That being said, that DVD box is in and of itself worth buying. My gosh, whoever marketed that shot of Jessica in that shirt should get marketing executive of the year or something.</p></body></html>

This weapon is a vile form of alien life that simply kills and breeds.  It's blood is molecular acid, it's body is one organic weapon after another and it grows extremely fast after taking another life that had been it's host.<br /><br />Alien is the purest of the sci-fi/horror genre.  It is also one of the first of it's kind and truely the pinnacle of it's kind.  It is all downhill from here, but the standard was so high we don't care to acknowledge this decline.  Alien is not only one of my favorite films of all time but it is also unquestionably one of the greatest films of all time and the few who disagree will have a tough view to spin.  The script is compelling with it's fiction and ideas of an ambiguous future setting that places the film in an unnerving microcosmic isolation.  There is enough to satisfy everyone, from space fans who want to hear about the atmosphere on the Alien's planetoid  and the horror fans who want to be scared by shock or spooky subtleties.  At it's heart, Alien is old school gothic horror in the setting of space.<br /><br />Some horror films are fortunate enough to have one scene that is memorable and will be praised for generations.  Then there are the horror elite that have more than that and are unforgettable from beginning to end.  The Exorcist, The Shining, Psycho, Jaws and Halloween are such films...and so is Alien.  Whether it be the slow-paced questioning of John Hurt's character's fate in the quarantined room with a parasite attached to his face keeping him alive, the scene with Tom Skerritt's character in the air shaft waiting for the Alien to come to him or the scene where we actually wait as the Alien burrows it's way through Hurt's character's body and out to eventually wreak havoc on the rest of the crew, Alien is without a doubt unforgettable. It is a staple in both the science fiction and horror genres and a must-have for fans of either.<br /><br />The most outstanding part about Alien to me is the fact that it is handled meticulously.  The scene when that Alien bursts out of Hurt's stomach is fairly layered and foreshadows Ash's (Ian Holm) real intentions but not enough where you know what is happening exactly, although maybe enough where you suspect something.  He is of course an android that takes the crew off course to obtain this life form and study it.  The scene has Holm studying Hurt as he is about die with a face that spells "Hmmm, let's see what this thing can actually do".  I credit Holm just as much as Scott for this example but Ridley Scott is without question an impeccable filmmaker.  Scott is also one of the most versatile filmmakers around.  He is almost on the same plateau as Spielberg for me.<br /><br />Finally, Alien is also groundbreaking for it's characters and mostly of course the character of Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver in what has to among the earliest portrayals of a women emerging as the protagonist in a film like this. Her emergence from the rest of the cast by the way is an extremely effective device in which too many films that have followed Alien have forgot to apply.  Even in good horror films we know full well who is going to survive all of the horrors before the credits even begin.  In Alien we really have no idea.  Weaver's character is given absolutely no special treatment by the script whatsoever.  She is simply Ripley, one of the two female crew members that by chance and wit has survived this horrifying encounter.  It also makes the horror of it far better because we might actually think for a minute that Skerritt's character is going to survive that ballsy plunge into the air vents.  This point is precisely why all of the sequels are just not as good as Alien is.  Although Jim Cameron knew what he had to do and opted to create a quality film of sci-fi action chaos with all the mysteries revealed by it's predecessor and although I'm running against popular opinion here, David Fincher's Alien 3 deserves some credit too.  The four installment is sort of a waste.<br /><br />Horror without mystery is simply madness and madness is not nearly as frightening as it is shocking.  This is why so few horror films are praised by critics.  Alien is not just original and innovative; it is sharpened, sophisticated and finer than the great majority of all films.  The fact that it provokes fear and excitement as well as thought makes it even more exceptional.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Big-time hit and miss film"></head><body><p>This movie is really a bit of a paradox. There are parts that I like and parts I hate, and though ultimately its an entertaining film I can't promise that I'm gonna take out my wallet to acquire a DVD or video. My feelings for this film can be divided into two categories:<br /><br />What I hate: everything with the humans<br /><br />What I love: everything with the apes<br /><br />The human characters are all too generic or barely developed for you to like them. Oh sure, you root for Mark Wahlburg, but he'll be the only one you're cheering for. The other human characters consist of: a black guy who has one or two lines then dies because, hey, he's the black guy; an annoying kid who is told to stay where he is and predictably runs out towards the apes, gets in trouble, and has to be saved; and a super-model woman (didn't know they had airbrushes on an ape planet) who is supposed to be the love interest though there's no connection except that Mark Wahlburg is a man and she's a woman, so obviously they have to fall in love.<br /><br />This now brings me to my next point: the apes are the best characters in this whole movie. And how can you miss with the actors playing them? Helena Bonham Carter, David Warner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti...but the one that tops them all is Tim Roth as General Thade. Tim Roth is EXCELLENT as the film's villain, and you can tell he really gets into the character. He constantly moves, talks, and acts like Thade. I know this film getting an Academy Award nomination may be a bit of a stretch, (then again, knowing the Academy Awards these days...) but if I had been in the nomination panel, Roth would have definately gotten my vote for best supporting actor.<br /><br />But it's not just these characters that either hurt or help my feelings about this movie. I was constantly hearing this wasn't a remake but a "re-realization" of the original story. Yeah, OK, then explain to my why there are constantly references to the original film through out the movie. Michael Clarke Duncan tells Mark Wahlburg, "Get your hands off me, you damn, dirty human!" Charlton Heston makes a cameo as Thade's dying father and, lamenting about the human's technology, mutters, "Damn them...damn them all the way to hell..." (the audience booed at that when I saw this in theaters) These moments add some corniness to the otherwise independent take on Pierre Boulle's original novel. Speaking of which, I was surprised to see this film take the novel's original ending, and I personally thought it was a nice touch. I won't give too much away, but if you've read the book then you'll know what I mean. The only difference is a change of location.<br /><br />This is one of those "one-time viewing" movies. Catch it on a movie channel or rent it from the store before buying. If you like it, buy it, if not, you won't feel bad for spending $15+ on something detestable.</p></body></html>

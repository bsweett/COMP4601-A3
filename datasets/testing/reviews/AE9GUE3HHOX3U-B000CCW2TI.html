I was actually intrigued when the plot started unfolding, I was thinking wow what an original concept.  I will admit the story was original and fresh, the acting was fantastic.  I think Cillian Murpghy is one of a kind.  His look is so unusual and androgenous, he is hot isn't he?  Once the plane landed and she stuck him with the pen, the movie started to take another direction of textbook run and chase, good guy vs. bad guy.  You could pretty much write the ending yourself.  Heroin saves the day and everyone goes home happy.  I would have liked one more twist in the plot at the end, to give the movie and edge over your standard thriller.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""A Movie That Never Becomes Dated""></head><body><p>"Independence Day" is one of Hollywood's best action/disaster films of all-time. Filled with remarkable special effects and a good script, "Independence Day" has gone on to be not only a beloved thrill-ride movie, but one of the biggest blockbusters in movie-making history making over $800,000,000 on a $75,000,000 budget.<br /><br /> The film is about a group of aliens who wreck havoc on mankind, killing people and destroying buildings, as humans fight desperately to save themselves from being destroyed by these evil forces. "Independence Day" is a combination of the movies "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "The Day After Tomorrow", and many of the neat disaster epics from the seventies, but produced on a much more high-scaled level where money was obviously no object for the studio: the producers wanted to make an extraordinary "disaster" film, and they succeeded. Both terrifying and jaw-dropping, "Independence Day" leaves the viewer wondering "could this really happen someday?".<br /><br /> The bonuses in this edition include 9 minutes of restored features, commentary by director Roland Emmerich, a 30-minute documentary on the making of "Independence Day", an HBO feature entitled "First Look: Independence Day" a 33 minute feature hosted by Jeff Goldblum, plus much more.</p></body></html>

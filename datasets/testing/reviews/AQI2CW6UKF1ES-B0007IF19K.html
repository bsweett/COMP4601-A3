<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievable movie on a unbelievable individual"></head><body><p>Well, after not being entertained by usual Jamie Foxx comedies, and not being inspired much by Will Smith's performance in Ali, I didn't have much expectations for this.  But after seeing collateral, I thought, hey maybe Jamie Foxx can pull it off.<br /><br />Ray Charles(Jamie Foxx) is undeniebly one of the greatest music legonds of all time.  He started off small time, then a man he considered like a brother to him Jeff Brown(Clifton Powell) helped him to try to get him a national superstar.  But even with his girlfriend who eventually became his wife, Della Bea, Robinson(Kerry Washington), and his newfound success, he couldn't escape his painful past, where he got more than blind. So he needed something to try to take the pain away.  Then one of his friends Fathead Newman(Bokeem Woodbine) gave him some evil in the needle.  What would become of a rising star that had a painful past, and alot of comming afflictions?<br /><br />This movie does a excellent job of telling Ray Charles life throughout, all he went through, the life problems, the critisism, the past, and, of course, his music.  This movie served the genres of drama, thriller, and biography with a fully loaded punch.  I mean, after watching the film, I couldn't even remember if Jamie Foxx ever did comedy before.  And the supporting cast really added a backup punch as well.  The only funny part was where the girl in the studio told Ray"you wouldn't save me if my @$$ was on fire."  And he said "d@mn right I wouldn't.<br /><br />Ray is unbalivable in a variety of ways, and shows how a blind man in a cold world gave the finger to all the odds, and rose to the heights of greatness. Jamie Foxx definitly deserved the award.  He proved he could do a role like this, and to me, he did a better job than Will Smith in Ali, Denzel Washington in Malcom X, and Samuel L. Jackson in Caoch Narter.  If Ray Charles, God rest his soul, could see this, I'm sure he'd be very proud to see his life reinacted in souch a spectacular way.  If anyone love the movies mentioned above, biographys, or dramas, MUST check this out.<br /><br />Rest in Peace:Ray Charles Robinson(1930-2004)<br /><br />Peace</p></body></html>

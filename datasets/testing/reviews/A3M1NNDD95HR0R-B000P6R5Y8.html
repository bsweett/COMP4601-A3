<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good Movie With Sadness On Occasion"></head><body><p>Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, and Zooey Deschanel are the actors who play the main characters in this movie.  They do a good job with their roles, but I admit I feel a bit misled about this movie.  I was under the impression that their magical world was more tangible and not just a figment of their imaginations.  There is not as much exploration into the fantasy world as I would have liked, and the story moves along a bit slow in places.  That said, it still is a pretty good movie with a couple of life lessons thrown in.  Disney films always make some kind of point.  The moral of the story may be "live life to the fullest, consider others even if they themselves seem inconsiderate, and don't underestimate the power of a good imagination."  I feel a bit bad for the children who starred in this movie because even though they really did a good job with their roles, the storyline was weak and there weren't many significant peaks to make it impactful or connect you strongly to the story.  A little disappointing, but not a complete waste of time.</p></body></html>

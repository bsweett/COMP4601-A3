<meta name="summary" content="Comedy with depth despite gross humor"></head><body><p>This is an interesting blend of some gross humor, not too much, and real drama but not sappiness among a group of women.  One is about to marry and her best friend is at odds with another close pal as they try to plan the wedding, get dresses, etc.  Wiig and Rudolph are hilarious and heartbreaking, but it's Melissa McCarthy who really steals the show in all of her scenes as one of the other friends.</p></body></html>

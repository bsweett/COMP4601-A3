<meta name="summary" content="BEAUTIFUL, THRILLING AND ROMANTIC"></head><body><p>Disney's 1959 groundbreaking, animated epic production SLEEPING BEAUTY Special Edition, the first animated feature drawn and photographed in a widescreen format (70mm Technirama), finally arrives on DVD in a glorious, fully-restored two-disc edition with superb, re-mixed surround sound and a wealth of extras.  It's the 14th Century and evil queen Malificent curses Aurora, the king's infant daughter, taking away her happily-ever-after. Or so it would seem.  <p>The brilliant interpretation of Tchaikovsky's ballet score and the distinctive medieval-inspired art of Eyvind Earle's detailed, pastel-hued, vertical-horizontal compositions, make this timeless romance -- based on a folk tale that arose after the Dark Ages (and a metaphor for the times?) -- a must-have for the digital family library and a masterpiece of animators' art.  Hold on to your dreams.  True love conquers all.  Available for a limited time.</p></body></html>

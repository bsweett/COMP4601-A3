In revealing the issues being experienced both by the heroes and villains the definition of a super hero becomes altered. Instead of a perfect being with super powers fighting the bad guys we see a man with problems like everyone else but one using a special gift to fight the forces of evil. As a result there is a little less action but just as much fun.</p></body></html>

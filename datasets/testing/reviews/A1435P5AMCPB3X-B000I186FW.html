<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, entertaining action, reminiscent of "the wall""></head><body><p>I belive this must be a heck of a comic book, and I hope they did it justice brining it to the big screen.  I like this movie a lot, and I'm going to be digging for the illustrated graphic novel soon.  The action in this movie is fast, whitty, and very well staged.  There is quite a bit of gore, but that adds to the impact of the situation that Britain is in.  The angles of the propaganda shots, speeches, and the banners are all reminiscent of camera work done for Alan Parker's classic, Pink Floyd's "The Wall".  For yonger fan's, check out "The Wall" for a deeper appreciation.  Of course, the scarry parallels to the Thrid Reich are also sink in the realism of this film too.  This is worth buying, and a no brain renter if you do not like buying.</p></body></html>

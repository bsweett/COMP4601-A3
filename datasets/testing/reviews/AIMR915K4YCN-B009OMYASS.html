Eli Roth has made a viciously tricky classic here. Unlike in his earlier CABIN FEVER, the main characters (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are likeable guys. They're unaware of the fact that their idea of fun- smoking as much pot, drinking as much alcohol, and nailing as many hot babes as humanly possible- is actually exploitive, and could even be dangerous. They are just young, hormonally explosive college kids, out for the experience of a lifetime. This is also their undoing, as they are oblivious to any hint of impending doom. Even after their buddy Oli disappears, they still return to the nightlfe and the two gals they've hooked up with. Hell has to literally open up in their faces before these guys realize they're in deep, deep trouble. HOSTEL is part horror / cautionary tale, part sadistic blast of jet-black humor, and part geo-political commentary. Roth builds the story slowly (they used to call this character development), revealing the true terror in one big switch, like waking up in a bloody nightmare, while suffering from the world's worst hangover! Yes, HOSTEL can be a gruesome, bleak affair, but it is probably not as gory or twisted as rumor has made it out to be. There is a certain morality buried under the bodies and viscera as well. That's another difference between HOSTEL and CABIN FEVER. HOSTEL hits you in the head and gut w/ a hammer for a reason, not simply to shock you and make you sick...</p></body></html>

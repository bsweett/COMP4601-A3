From the actors to the beautiful scenery, "Troy" is a film of brilliance.<br /><br />Brad Pitt fits the role of Achilles perfectly. Everyone does a great job in their characters. The story is really one of tragedy and misunderstandings. You notice in this film that a lot of the destruction and death was caused by wrong decisions. I really do love this movie, and if you love the story of the Trojan War and you love Greek Mythology. This is for you!</p></body></html>

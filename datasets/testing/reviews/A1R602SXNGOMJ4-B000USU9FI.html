<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing...considering the cast"></head><body><p>This movie is another classic example of what is wrong with so many Hollywood movies lately. They are all about flash and forget the substance. I picked up the Manchurian Candidate because Denzel Washington always delivers a watchable performance and because of the history of the original film.<br /><br />Although it was not boring, it didn't have the excitement, the edge-of-your-seat suspense that the original '62 picture had.The Manchurian Candidate is just plain dull. Never mind the original version -- this is not a remake as much as it is an adaptation so I judge it strictly on its own merits. However, it is so weak that it barely has its own merits. The story is slow and inconsistent and the directing is just plain heavy handed - focusing more on mood and music rather than story and plot. At one point about 15 minutes from the end credits all of the implications crystallize and the viewer can finally care - if they haven't given up completely.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A lot of fun indeed, proves that not every celebrity couple produces a `Gigli'..."></head><body><p>Despite the fact that this movie received more attention due to its stars off-screen relationship and most likely destroyed the box-office because of it, there is really no denying that on-screen these two are impeccable together.  Honestly, watching them together is so natural and pleasant that if their home life is anything like their film life then I completely understand why they're together.  They interact so effortlessly together, so naturally and beautifully that it transcends acting altogether.  That really is the biggest draw to `Mr. & Mrs. Smith'.  This is one of those cases where the actors really elevate the body of the film.  `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has is detractors, but overall this is such a fun film that those faults are easily forgiven.  Angelina Jolie has never been more radiant then she is in this film (I'm telling you, I don't get the Golden Globe `Comedy/Musical' Actress snub at all!!!), and Brad Pitt has never been more charming (some may disagree, but I'm sticking with that statement for the time being).  That coupled with Adam Brody and Vince Vaughn serving up some hilarious supporting performances and you get a well rounded good time.<br /><br />So the movie finds our two stars in a loveless marriage if that is at all believable.  The first scene has them arguing calmly before a marriage councilor.  In a sense they are bored.  They've been married for five or six years and within those years their lives have become so routine, so predictable that they can't stand each other.  What each fails to realize is that their lives are the furthest things from routine, for they really don't know each other at all.  In fact, both John and Jane Smith are assassins working for conflicting agencies, and when they are both hired to assassinate the same target they end up confronted with the truth about each other, and their marriage starts to heat up as they are instructed to take each other out.<br /><br />The film's major detractor is its running length.  While it is only a two hour film and that in itself may not seem like a long time, with a film of the genre it can seem to drag a bit.  I know that seems odd but action films, like comedies, are generally shorter than your dramas and biopics.  By the time you get to the final stretch of `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' you may feel a bit worn out, but it's only a mere few minutes away from the credits so hold in there.  Aside from that minor complaint I really can't say too many bad things about this film.  At times it is a bit clich&eacute;d, but what film isn't these days.  The acting, like I said, really makes up for any and all issues with the film.  Aside from Pitt and Jolie there is Vince Vaughn who is just hysterical here as John's best friend Eddie, and Adam Brody is spot on as Benjamin Danz, a kid who may know more than he's letting on.  I would have loved to see Kerry Washington used a little more than she is.  Her role is really thankless, and she is so very talented.<br /><br />The action sequences are great here, but obviously censored.  The film's original rating was R, at least that's what I had gathered at the time of release, and that significant cuts where made (especially in that already steamy love scene) and I'm sure those cuts inched there way over into some of the violent sequences.  That said, it's not anything too drastic for enjoyment.  The fight/love scene in particular is so breathtakingly done that it is the immediate highlight of the film.  Not that I'm an advocate for spousal abuse (lord knows I'm the farthest thing from) but that particular scene looks like a lot of fun.  Anyways, moving on, the film is entertaining in just about every respect and is more than just a celebrity gossip piece.  So what if this spawned the most widely talked about Hollywood romance in the history of Hollywood romances, that's the furthest thing from the point.  When the dust settles and the paparazzi get their pictures (and those crazy fans get their hugs) we're left with an entertaining, enjoyable and crowd pleasing good time, and that my friends is exactly what we're looking for.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Guns, Guns, Guns, Yeah!""></head><body><p>This movie is in many ways a first of its kind, and in many ways it isn't. Lord of War deals with gunrunning, something I've never seen in movies to this scale. For that, I have to give this movie one extra star. But at the same time, this movie has a lot of similarities to Blow, by forcing us to cheer for the bad guy who is doing nothing but contributing to the destruction of the world. Only instead of cocaine, the Lord of War deals in AK-47s.<br /><br />This movie follows the story of Yuri Orlov as he first discovers the profits to be gained in dealing in black-market weapons, and then as he learns the dangers of continuing in the trade. Though surely an intelligent man, he's also one-sighted; all he cares about is how and who to sell his weapons to, or how to gain more weapons at cheap prices. Hell, the day his son first walks is also the day the Cold War officially ends. Do you think he'd be excited about the first steps of his son? Nope, he cares about the massive surplus of Russian weapons left behind because of the ending of the Cold War. Despite all that, he's able to avoid Interpol for years on end, and gets himself involved with one of the most legendary and evil dictators in history, Andre Baptiste.<br /><br />This is a movie of screwed up moral issues. Yuri gets into your head during this movie, and we believe that, though he wants war, he doesn't want death. If he had it his way, he would wish for all the weapons he sold to "miss" there target. And he's just such a lovable character. He risks his life daily for what he believes, no matter how off-base those beliefs are, and wants nothing more than to continue supporting his family. He's obviously intelligent. And he's funny, in a morbid sort of way.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is a movie of acquired tastes. If you have no interest in guns (like me), or do not wish to glorify them, then this obviously isn't the movie for you. But if you have a high tolerance for things such as this, then get Lord of War. It's a good movie with a style all its own, and one based off of true events.</p></body></html>

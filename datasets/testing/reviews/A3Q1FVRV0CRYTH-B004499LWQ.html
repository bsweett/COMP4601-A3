Dan is an aspiring auther who happens to bump into Alice (Portman) due to an accident.  Dan is smitten almost immediatly with this exsentric young lady (Portmans charactor reminds me a little of Winsletts charactor in ESoaSM).  Enter Anna (Roberts), a photographer who takes pictures of Dan for his novel...as you may have guessed (as did I) the time has passed years maybe and Dan and Alice are now an item and Dan has published his book.  Well, heres the problem.  Dan falls for Anna but she won't have him, you know, she won't bring herself to wreck what he has going on with Alice, but Dan is insistant.  In an attempt to exact his revenge on Anna, Dan goes to a sex-chat room and finds Larry (Owen), a sex hungrey Doctor with a few fetishes up his sleeve.  Well, Dad is under the ID of Anna and he describes himself to Larry and asks to meet him.  How Dan knew where Anna would be is beyond me, but by chance he was right and Larry meets Anna, and Larry likes Anna, and surprisingly Anna likes Larry and soon the two are engaged.  Now it's time for the fun to begin.  See now we have the affair that stirs up between Dan and Anna, the illicit afair that should have never happened.  The affair that tears apart a marriage and Dan's healthy (if you could call it that) relationship with a stripper (did I mention Alice was a stripper?  don't get your hopes up boys, no boobs).  Anyways, I have this to say...it's not the act of cheating on your partner that makes this whole movie so, how do I put this, demoralizing, because everybody knows that a lot of people cheat...it's the lack of compassion these people have for the ones they are hurting.  The way they talk to each other shows nothing but disgust for their supposed mate...the one they vowed to love forever.  As a married man I can honestly say that I could never talk to my wife the way these people communicate, but then again, I've never been in this sort of situation and I guess if my wife slept with some other man and told be she liked the taste of his seman better than mine I'd probably have a word or two to say to her as well, but other than that, lets be real here...These people seem to have no respect for themselves, but then again it's as if they really don't even know who they are...To tell you the truth I honestly thought this movie would be different, but thats not to say I didn't like it...I gave it four stars and thats mainly because it was so different than anything I've seen and it took a situation and made you look at it in a way I've never looked at it before...it really made you think...Believe me, there are no role models here, and despite how things end up it's really less than a happy ending...especially for Dan, but what the heck...I mean, he deserved it...Right?</p></body></html>

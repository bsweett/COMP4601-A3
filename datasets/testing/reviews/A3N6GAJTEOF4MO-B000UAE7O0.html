These movie theatres would usually display 1, 2 or even 3 movies in a row. The movies were relatively low budget in exchange for high levels of advertising. Both Tarrantino and Rodriguez have spoken of their love for the Grindhouse theatres as kids. They both set about to make two separate movies that would be shown in succession, but in between would feature commercials for further fictional movies. This, in their mind would create the same atmosphere that they experienced as kids. It didn't work and a lot of the time, after the first movie would end (Either Planet Terror or Death Proof) movie go'ers assumed that was it and would leave. Not knowing there is another movie to follow after the commercial breaks. Because of this failure, against their will both Rodriguez and Tarrantino decided to release the movies separately and the success grew from there. I've seen Tarrantino's Death Proof, and I must say I didn't really care for it. This is why we have Planet Terror. In case you don't have the attention span to follow an hour or so of dialogue, then at least you get this movie in which people get blown to pieces every couple of minutes. I am the latter and I absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />It had cheesy dialogue that, at times made no sense and had no place in the situation our heroes where presented with. The gore was reminiscent of my beloved classic sci-fi gross out flicks that, instead of using CGI endeavored to create the gore for real (not using actual body parts though). This made some of the craziness more genuine and in Planet Terror actually made my stomach turn.<br /><br />In Texas, a gang leaded by the black market dealer Abby faces a group of renegade militaries leaded by Captain Muldoon in an abandoned military base. During their shootout, Abby shoots a recipient of biological weapon, releasing an experimental highly-contagious gas that turns humans to flesh-eating zombies. Meanwhile, in the local hospital, Dr. Block sees an epidemic with many patients with the same nasty symptoms. When the outbreak affects most of the local population, a group of people with immunity leaded by the mechanic Wray, Sheriff Hague, the stripper Cherry and the Dr. Dakota, fight to survive and become the last hope to save the world.<br /><br />This was an awesome mind numbing movie that went at a mile a minute. It doesn't seek to be intelligent or even have a go at some random intelligent speeches. Be warned, this movie is stupid and watching it may make you a few points lower in your IQ. One thing I have to tell you is that it's really worth it as it's so much fun. I'm actually disappointed that Tarrantino's installment didn't really deliver for me.<br /><br />Buy it and enjoy it.</p></body></html>

Clooney plays an executive who goes from city to city(with a heap of flyer miles to boot)and fires people from their jobs. To watch these parts of the movie is sobering to say the very least and then it gets downright impersonal when a new young upstart(Anna Kendrick) brings in an idea to do it via videocam; First of all, it was funky doing it in personal, now it got downright terrible. Quite a sobering movie. Clooney already knows the drill and the job, but he meets a lady(Vera Farmiga), whom he likes because she lives a similar life and feels that perhaps she's the one for him but come to find out she has her own separate life that slaps him in the face. The scene where he is coming from meeting her and he finds out he got the 10 Million Miles points and special pin makes you wonder if that was worth all that he put up with. The young lady that he pairs up with and had the good idea, hits the road because the job gets to HER(imagine that) but all in all, the movie is worth the accolades it deserves. I must also speak on the opening song performed by Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. That alone sets the tone for the movie and is worth you checking out the group on You Tube. I am sorry they didn't get Best Picture but it was worth the nomination it received. One more thing. Jason Reitman, who is the director, is noteworthy and one to watch for because this was his second time coming up for an Oscar and he's pretty much the new kid on the block.</p></body></html>

People that were even at historic events will say "it was like a movie". How can you ever know what it would be like to be on a plane that you and everyone on board knows is going to crash? You can't. It transcends waking consciousness. It still can be imagined, however. It can be portrayed in such a way as to give you the viewer *some* idea -I really believe this after seeing UNITED 93. And it is scary as hell. If you allow yourself to be absorbed by this film I feel you'll come as close as a movie can take you in having some sense -just some- of the sheer terror. You are going to die. It's over. It is over. Your life is gone. You begin to realize this. At first there is denial of coarse but one way or another reality sets in for you. You will never see your family again. You will never eat again, hug your child again, go to the park again, go to the movies again, make love again, nothing. Your going to die in the worst way. You are about to be broken, ripped apart, burned. What awaits you? Are you even able to think or you just overcome? The horror. The flood of emotion, of thoughts, images, your life flashing before you. People freaking out around you. Murderous little foreign relgious nuts, creeps with box cutters stabbing people. What are you going to do? What do you do? What can you do? You'll never really know unless your in that situation. Some people on that plane decided not to just sit there and wait to die. That's not too bad a way to go out. UNITED 93 is a fine film and does justice to this historic moment in American history. Credit is to be given to director Paul Greengrass [THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, and the upcoming GREEN ZONE(!)] for his talents in depicting real-life events in such an outstanding way.<br /><br />Watch it alone or with someone who can sit through a movie without running their mouth. Turn the lights off, turn the cell phone off, shut up, and sit there straight through, no interruptions. But don't buy it, it's a rental. I don't know why or how someone would want to sit through this ride multiple times. One, maybe two trips is enough.</p></body></html>

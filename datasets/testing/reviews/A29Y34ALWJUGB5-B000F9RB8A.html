<meta name="summary" content="The New Kung-fu Film"></head><body><p>This movie starts out on a serious note but quickly fades into one of simple hilarity, and keeps that tone for the remainder of the movie. Special effects dominate the movie but don't intrude, leaving an oddly believable style of action behind (floating characters, super strength punches, puffed-up breasts). Stephen Chow is the new Jackie Chan. I recommend this movie highly.</p></body></html>

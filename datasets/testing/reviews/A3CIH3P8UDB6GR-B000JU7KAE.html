Some of his movies are "so so." I thought for the beginning of this movie, "why did i buy this movie?" "I can't believe I bought this movie." "This movie looks stupid."  Because from the beginning, I didn't want to buy this movie, but I did, only because of the fanbase. Was I disappointed?  No.  Was it Night best film?  No. Overall view is this:  Creative!  Think about it? A story "within" a story. I kind of got this feeling from this film that it wasn't "directed" towards everyone. It was almost like a "child like thinking" for a kid who loves mysticals. It is a bed time story that supposebly came to life. Hello, Creative!  I thought one cool part of it was, "trying to find who's the characters"  After the movie, I didn't feel that "awe factor" but I felt like it was pretty good. In order to really like this movie, I had to think "ok its just a bed time story" That's it! lol its not based on a true "story" It was a guessing game from almost the beginning.  Just like any bedtime story, you were intrigue to find out what was going on, who's who, and how will it end.  I like it, but it's not my favorite Night film, but I'm happy with the purchase!</p></body></html>

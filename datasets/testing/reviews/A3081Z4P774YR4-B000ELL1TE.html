To explain the whole plot would just waste time. There are two reasons this film works: the soundtrack and the cast. The music for this movie runs the gamut, from such bands as Massive Attack and pop icons like Madonna (hey, who's she married to again? I'm kidding.). The cast is great, with some shockingly funny performances by Brad Pitt (the subtitles for him specifically on the DVD shed some light on his dialogue), Benicio Del Toro (good for the time he's in this), Vinnie Jones (thoroughly smooth), and many, many others. There are some great scenes, inlcuding a botched heist (apparently inspired by many crimes caught on tape), a seemingly unkillable nemesis that refuses to stay dead, and a few thoroughly horrible deaths. If you are easily offended, this movie's probably not for you. For the rest of you, it's worth a rental.</p></body></html>

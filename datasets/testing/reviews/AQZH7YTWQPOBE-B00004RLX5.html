<meta name="summary" content="A Trek classic"></head><body><p>Of all the Star Trek movies, this is probably one of the best and one of the few to make an impact with a wide audience (only <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00078XGRO">Star Trek - First Contact</a> compares). The plotline is funny, uplifting, and memorable. Having seen Humpback Whales in the wild, I also appreciate the movie's message - that in harming our environment, we are harming ourselves.<br /><br />With that said, Star Trek IV is tough to follow if you aren't at least somewhat familiar with the Trek universe. This movie especially picks up near the end of a story arc, so it doesn't take time at the beginning to introduce the characters or Trek universe.<br /><br />Another problem - special effects really are dated. The Klingon Bird of Prey on Vulcan is obviously a painting - a good painting, but a painting nonetheless. While I'm not crazy about the idea of going back and adding computer generated special effects a la the Star Wars Special Editions, Star Trek IV could have used touchups and better-looking ships in a few places. Fortunately, this movie (unlike some of the later Treks) was not about special effects, but rather a heartwarming story.<br /><br />Humpback Whale populations are on the upswing now. I think in some small way, Star Trek IV helped international efforts toward protecting whales.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Hillbilly Review of A Fashion Film"></head><body><p>Lauren Weisberger used her experience as assistant to "Vogue" editor Anna Wintour as background for her novel "The Devil Wears Prada," which I'll admit is unread by me.  My goal in this review is to stay out of the pre-existing discussion regarding the similarities between the real Wintour and the fictional Miranda Priestly.  I'll also admit that my own knowledge and appreciation for "fashion" is not much beyond the fact that the pinstripes of the New York Yankees are the Brooks Brothers of sports uniforms.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays Andrea "Andy" Sachs, an intelligent and eager recent journalism graduate.  Job opportunities, she explains in an early expository scene, are scarce and limited to working for an auto repair magazine or "Runway," a fictional fashion icon modeled after "Vogue."  (The film does not explain how, with so few job opportunities available, the disinterested Sachs secures the position she is reminded repeatedly "a million girls would die for.")<br /><br />Andy is hired as the second assistant to Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly.  Emily Blunt portrays Emily, Miranda's haughty first assistant. Miranda rules the fashion industry from her perch atop "Runway."  The world's top designers alter their entire lines based on a nod of her head.  She lords her power over all of her minions and only allows an intimate select few, such as Stanley Tucci's wonderful Nigel, speak to her with anything other than genuflection.  Streep's characterization is a marvel.  Body language and facial expression convey as much as her economical, chilly words.<br /><br />Andy initially has no particular regard for fashion or those who govern it, but she needs the job.  I saw the film when it was first released in 2006 and at that time I respected a brief speech Miranda gives Andy regarding the importance of fashion in general, and Miranda's pre-eminent position specifically, but after viewing the film a second time I couldn't help but think "who CARES if one woman says 'cerulean blue is IN?'"  Trying to get a foothold at "Runway," Andy begs the sympathetic Nigel to impart on her a modicum of style, and some of the best scenes in the film show Andy's transformation from "college drab" to fashionable attention-getter.  (Although Andy is a "fat" size 6 - "the new 14", Nigel tells her.) This threatens Emily's position as first assistant, but gathers a few glances of approval from Miranda.<br /><br />Pre-Entourage Adrian Grenier portrays Andy's chef-boyfriend Nate and Tracie Thoms plays best friend Lily.  The central conflict of the film comes in Andy's mental and emotional transformation.  She is willing to wear the clothes and pretend to be one of Miranda's fawning sycophants, but the actual demands of the job begin to make Andy someone indistinguishable from Runway's shallow fashionistas to her truest friends.  Pre-Mentalist Simon Baker (the casting director for "Devil" gets kudos!) plays Christian Thomson, a hot New York writer who takes a fancy to Andy, further complicating her busy life.<br /><br />How much is Andy willing to turn her back on her friends to ride Runway's gravy train to her desired job as a New York Writer?  Weisberger's book was placed in the chick-lit genre, which I suppose makes this film a chick flick, but unlike a few in that film genre (Sex and the City comes to mind - how can the central male character in this series be known only as "Mr. Big"?) this movie is not totally dismissive of males and their perspective.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ellen Page Makes "Juno" a Great Film"></head><body><p>Ellen Page plays Juno MacGuff, a teenager who becomes pregnant by her high school boyfriend whom she reluctantly denies that she loves. Juno is faced with the task of trying to decide whether to have an abortion or give her unborn child up for adoption. But ends up deciding to give up her baby for adoption and goes about finding the perfect parents to adopt her unborn child.<br /><br />Juno Macguff isn't your average teenage beauty involved in sports, cheerleading & so on... She's into music and is funny in a dry/witty/dark humor kind of way.... Ellen Page plays the character perfectly and is in fact, the best actor in the movie! I think Ellen Page will remain on the acting scene for a long time with her talent.<br /><br />Anyway, "Juno" is definitely a different sort of coming of age story and a good one at that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="LOST Goonies"></head><body><p>Super8 is an unabashed mix of some John Carpenter, 80s Spielberg and and the pilot of LOST.  Now each of those things in its own right can be inspired, but somehow all of them together don't move past the feeling this is an extended episode of a cable TV show.<br /><br />I'm not going to point in too many directions to spoil the film, but J.J. Abrahms pulls the Shyamalan card too and tries to lead us with bread crumbs into something surprising.  There are no surprises.  The movie would have been better served sticking to the core of friends out to make a movie instead of going to the recycle bin.  The friends making a movie part actually rings true from the heart, but it quickly goes down the chase movie route and the bulk is been there done that 30 years ago and then some.<br /><br />Is that to say the movie is not worth your time?  Heck no.  Super 8 is not surprising, nor original, but the movie is entertaining.  Buy?  Nope.  Rent?  Heck yeah.</p></body></html>

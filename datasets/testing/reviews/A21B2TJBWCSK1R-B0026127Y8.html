<meta name="summary" content="Another No-Nonsense Action film from Luc Besson"></head><body><p>When Taken was finally released in North America, after already playing in Europe for a year, it became a surprise hit. Not bad for what is essentially a B-movie revenge story starring an A-list actor. The film was produced by French filmmaker Luc Besson, who's responsible for action classics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008ZZ9E">La Femme Nikita (Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GVJEE">Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)</a>. He also produced and co-wrote the popular Transporter films so he certainly knows what audiences around the world want to see.<br /><br />The film delivers exactly what it promises: an excellent and entertaining thrill ride with no frills. It is as single-minded as its protagonist's mission and plugs in exciting car chases, fight scenes and gun battles. And yet, you are still emotionally invested in Neeson's character - you care about what happens to him and his daughter. The result is a truly satisfying and engaging film.<br /><br />You have the option of watching the theatrical version or the unrated cut.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Pierre Morel and cinematographers Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne. They decided on two distinctive looks for the film: sunny and vibrant colours for Los Angeles and a darker vibe for Paris. They talk about the differences between American and French film crews. They also praise Liam Neeson's ability to play a loving father and a deadly killing machine. They also talks about the challenges of working in a city like Paris.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary by co-screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. He mentioned that he's been writing for 30 years with 15 of them with Luc Besson. They met on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GVJE4">The Fifth Element (Ultimate Edition)</a>. He worked with the filmmaker on creating a production company in Europe writing "low-impact action movies." Kamen says that the premise of the film was based on a story Besson heard from a French cop. Kamen also talks about how he writes with Besson and praises his "cinematic vision."<br /><br />"Le Making Of" is fairly standard if not engaging press kit material with the main cast talking about their characters and the story with clips from the film. There is plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of some of the film's exciting action sequences being shot.<br /><br />"Avant Premiere" features footage of the film's world premiere in France with Neeson, Morel and Besson doing interviews on the red carpet. There is haunting footage of Neeson and his late wife Natasha Richardson who was also in attendance.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons," which takes a look at six action sequences being filmed along with the finished product.</p></body></html>

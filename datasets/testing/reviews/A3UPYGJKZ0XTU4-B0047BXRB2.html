<meta name="summary" content="Big Colorful Sci-Fi Allegory with a Lasting Influence on the Genre."></head><body><p>"Forbidden Planet", created at MGM in 1956, was a high-budget high-concept science fiction film among the many low-budget sci-fi flicks made for drive-in theaters in that decade. It doesn't possess the intellectualism of "The Day the Earth Stood Still", nor does it hold up as well, but the two films have common themes. Cdr. John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) leads a mission to the planet Altair-4, where an expedition landed 20 years before and has not been heard from since. His ship is warned away by Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), a survivor of the earlier mission. Morbius explains the violent fate met by his colleagues and urges the visitors to leave. Only Morbius and his comely daughter Altaira (Ann Francis) have survived and thrived. Now aware of the disaster, Adams must await instructions from Earth. But some invisible threat still lurks on the planet.<br /><br />It was probably the film's brightly colored Cinemscope, friendly robot Robby, and neat-o special effects that most impressed audiences when it was released, but I was struck by "Forbidden Planet"s obvious influence on subsequent science fiction films and television. The impact on Gene Roddenberry's "Star Trek" was substantial, right down to the costumes, the communicators, and, of course, the allegory -though Roddenberry was decidedly more optimistic. "Forbidden Planet" posits that technology and knowledge do not fundamentally change people. A species cannot grow out of its violent primitivism. A gloomy message for a big, colorful, sci-fi adventure. I don't know what to make of the acting style, which I found peculiarly wooden. But this is a must-see for science fiction fans, if only because it is so recognizable in retrospect.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner 2000): This disc is two-sided, with full screen on one side and widescreen on the other. The print is perfectly watchable but not clean. There are white specks. A theatrical trailer (4 min) is included. George Lucas seems to have taken some visual inspiration from this trailer, though the "Star Wars" saga has more in common with B-movies. Subtitles and captioning for the hearing impaired are available in English, French, and Spanish.</p></body></html>

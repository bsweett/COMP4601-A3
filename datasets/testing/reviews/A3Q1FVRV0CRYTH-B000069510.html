<meta name="summary" content="Not scary but pretty fun"></head><body><p>I went to see this film when it first came out and I was syked since I love the video game.  I was wanting to be scared to death but that didn't happen.  I didn't even get a shiver.  The film is done as a action film, not a thriller so don't expect to piss your pants in fear.  The action scenes are decent and the gore level is up there...some of the CGI is a little corny but Jovovich is enough to make you forgive the defects of the film.  It's fun and entertaining while not living up to the hype I placed on it.  I give it four stars because for what it is, an action film with a beautiful star, it pulls through.  It just doesn't have the same feel the video game has...it doesn't do the game justice in that respect.  But if you want to see a bunch of people shooting zombies and rabbid dogs then this is for you.</p></body></html>

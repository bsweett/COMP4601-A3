However, in his divorce from Linda Hamilton, he gave her the rights to the Terminator movies, which she then sold, enabling this film to be made. It would have been nice to have Edward Furlong reprise his role as John Connor, however, he was dealing with substance abuse issues at the time. People complain that Skynet should have been terminated by the events of the second movie, however, Skynet is software, and all that was destroyed in the second movie was hardware, which would still be developed, although later in history.</p></body></html>

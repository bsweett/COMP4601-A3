<meta name="summary" content="Sci-fi with an egyptian twist"></head><body><p>Director Roland Emmerich has been largely been known as being an action-film director rather than an "auteur". In the same camp as Michael Bay, they make films that are not supposed to have big personal investments or even good dialogue, they're for pure entertainment value, nothing more. Before they blew up the White House in Independence Day, ruined Godzilla and froze New York, they did Stargate, an intriguing sci-fi movie which unfortunately doesn't have the greatest transfer.<br /><br />It's 1928 and scientists in Egypt have discovered a big artifact. Flash forward to present day and scientist Daniel Jackson gets hired to decipher the artifact, a big stone tablet with markings. Taking 2 weeks he figures it out, it's a "stargate" which has the power to zip to a point in space. Also uncovered with the tablet is the actual stargate which they then open(in probably my favorite water effect since the Abyss' water tentacle) and step through.<br /><br />On the other side, it's actually very reminiscent of ancient Egypt. They find a tribe of people who are governed by the Sun God Ra, who's looking for immortality(aren't they all?). Things get complicated when the US orders that if there's a threat that they blow up the Stargate. But of course Ra finds the bomb and coupled with the mineral he uses the tribe to mine it has an even bigger destructive power than normal. So it's basically stop Ra, save the tribe, and save Earth. Sheesh, you think aliens would attack some other planet for once.<br /><br />It's interesting that a sci-fi movie is actually very modern looking. Besides the technology, it's very low-key. There's no big spaceships a-la Independence Day, big weaponry like Star Wars or odd creatures like Alien. That's part of its charm: it's sci-fi but it's got a bit of a distinctiveness, even though the plot isn't exactly new. You could replace the galaxy travel with time travel and you're in the same ballpark.<br /><br />If there's one thing that's unfortunate is that the transfer is still not that good. This is the 3rd iteration of Stargate on dvd and there's still problems. For one, on occasion I noticed the image got slightly grainy. Another was there was some specks on the image, like black lines. Overall this is a better transfer than the last 2 but there's still problems.<br /><br />Another is that there's very little features. There's a commentary and there's a featurette. Boom, that's it. Kind of like Terminator 2's DVD, one contains a great transfer but very little features while the previous one contained a boatload of features but not the greatest transfer.<br /><br />Similar to Firefly/Serenity which mixed traditional/modern themes with sci-fi, Stargate is an underrated film that while it does have problems here and there, it's still an enjoyable film and since it's Roland, he's pretty much succeeded. Now if he can step it up a notch...</p></body></html>

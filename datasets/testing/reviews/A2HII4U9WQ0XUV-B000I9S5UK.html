Ethan Hawke (playing Detroit PD Sgt. Jake Roenick)goes right to work, seizing control of the screen from the first second, sporting a buzz-cut, meth-ruined chompers, and an addict's goofy grin and acid-fast rambling conversation as he lures two Serbian druglords into a sting---and makes a *really* bad call, which sets us up for Movie #2 and had me thinking I was about to see something groundbreaking.<br /><br />Movie #2: Boy was I wrong---Movie #1 is only about eight minutes long, so basically "Assault on Precinct 13" *is* Movie #2, and unlike Movie #1, this ain't a good movie---nor is it interesting enough, or take any real risks, to be truly bad. Like the title character from "Shirley Valentine" said of her husband, "It's not that my old man is bad---he's just no bleeding *good*".<br /><br />The same can be said of the new "Assault'", which tries desperately to be hip, hard, cold, technical, and cool---and falls on its face. "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place on New Year's Eve, in a Detroit police precinct house that is being shut down (no phones, no computers, no way to call for backup---you getting that sinking feeling?) on the snowiest, nastiest, coldest day of the entire year. Sgt. Roenick (Hawke) and company are closing the station down and getting ready to party like it's 1999---er, 2004.<br /><br />Midway through the festivities, the prison-bus transporting Uber-bad-dude Maurice Bishop (Lawrence Fishburne, reclaiming both dignity and cool after his Eat-a-Burger stint in the last two Matrix movies), a druglord being prepped for trial, has to make an emergency stop at Precinct 13. Baddies with ski-masks and black SUVs show up shortly thereafter with enough firepower to knock off a third-world country(and have stuff left over) and a hankering to send Bishop into the hereafter.<br /><br />Result: Siege. Grand Result: Total boredom.<br /><br />Stuff I liked:<br /><br />1) The killer opening sequence and Ethan Hawke, who---much as he did in "Training Day"---takes standard, mediocre action fare and brings his entire being to the material. Jake Roenick is nothing we haven't seen before ("Lethal Weapon"-lite, actually), but Hawke makes us care. Nice job.<br /><br />2)Lawrence Fishburne as a hip one-liner spouting cool-Machine. It's nice to see Fishburne get his mojo back.<br /><br />3)I LOOOOOOVE techology!---and in the new Assault, we get tons of it: machine guns, assault rifles of every stripe and sort, hip little MP-5 shooters, tracer bullets, sniper scopes, laser targeting, nightvision goggles, you name it, Assault has it.<br /><br />4) CGI-snow: I'm not being nasty, I thought the CGI-snow worked---it looks great. Frankly, the movie looks great: the bleak sequences where Hawke is driving to the stationhouse in his Mustang, the vast stretches of Michigan industrial-slag scape, the fight in the woods, the deserted factories around the stationhouse---Assault may not *be* good, but it looks good.<br /><br />5) Retro-songs: "You're nobody Til Somebody Loves You" took me back to "Diehard", which this movie badly wishes it was.<br /><br />6) John Leguizamo & Brian Dennehy. Leguizamo (Beck) owns this movie as a strung-out junkie con, body by Meth, politics by Che Guevara. He owns every single scene he's in. Same with the action sequences: the only time "Assault" ripped and roared, Leguizamo had the gun. Brian Dennehy (O'Shea) is at his overweight-veteran-character-actor best, and gets the grooviest death scene I've seen in years.<br /><br />Things that stunk up the joint:<br /><br />1)The Siege Idea itself: Gabriel Byrne (Duvall) makes the stupidest decision ever: why send your loaded-for-full-warfare henchmen to kill cops at a police precinct, even if you absolutely, positively have to kill the bad-guy overnight? Wouldn't one single sniper on a rooftop when Bishop gets to his destination have been just as effective? Why take the risk?<br /><br />2) Don't let French people direct American action flicks. I loved Luc Besson's "The Professional" as much as anyone, but the SWAT team thing (sending cop after expendable cop to "check it out", just so Jean Reno could rack up a bodycount) did *not* reflect any kind of reality in terms of SWAT ops.<br /><br />Same here. Byrne's guys are truly the gang that couldn't shoot straight: from the pathetic opening attack, to the one-time use of their laser-scopes, to the inept snipers, to the hapless and over-equipped assaulters---the bad guys in Assault make Imperial Stormtroopers look like crack shots, while Byrne sits in his SUV, drinks coffee, and sulks.<br /><br />3) Ja Rule. Every scene he's in made me pray for his brutal, violent death. Note: Violent, yes, but not nearly brutal enough.<br /><br />4) The Action sequences are crap. Richet uses extremely close cuts and quick editing, so you can never see what's happening. We also never really get a good idea of the stationhouse layout or the neighborhood geography, so the boundaries of this siege are never spelled out. As a result, I could care less about when the troops are moving in, or from what angle.<br /><br />The new Assault could have been a contender, but instead emerges as an object lesson in how not to kill a bad-guy. It's the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac: greasy, cheesy, mediocre, and instantly forgettable, and leaves you fat and sluggish afterwards. Check out the original Carpenter classic instead.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

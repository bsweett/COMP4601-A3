Patience Phillips, Catwoman's alter ego, was murdered by the henchmen of a major makeup producing company when Patience discovers a secret she and the public weren't suppose know about.  Now, as Catwoman, Patience is out to get her revenge.<br /><br />This movie if fun, but there is not a lot to get excited about.  The best part of the movie is Berry's portrayal of a woman that is part cat.  From hissing at dogs to quick head movements while watching fish in a tank, Berry did a good job adding cat manerisms to the character.  She moved like a cat in many of the fight scenes.<br /><br />The ridiculous part of this character was the costume.  The idea was lots of leather and skin.  While Halle looked dynamite, the costume was too far gone from the traditional catwoman outfit.  The costume that Michelle Pfeiffer wore in 'Batman Returns' was far superior.<br /><br />The other actors in the movie were largely misused.  Benjamin Bratt plays an officer that is too far off the character he once portrayed in 'Law & Order.'  However, we don't get much of a chance to really know his character.  His character essentially boils down to sensitive hunk cop.  Sharon Stone looked good in her role as one of the villains, but her screen time and motivations as a character were way too limited.  Her and the other villain's scheme was largely laughable and highly inplausible.<br /><br />While there were some good action scenes, they weren't anything spectacular or original.  Many of them were reminiscent of the fights from the 'Batman' series.  The climatic battle in the end just came off as ridiculous.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was fun, but it was also a disappointment.  As mentioned earlier, the characters were misused and underdeveloped.  Another twenty to thirty minutes might have done this movie some good.  So would some revisions on the script.  Anyway, its worth a rental, but not worthy of adding to my collection.<br /><br />Overall:  2.75 stars.</p></body></html>

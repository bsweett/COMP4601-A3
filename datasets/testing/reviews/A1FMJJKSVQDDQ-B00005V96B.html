<meta name="summary" content="The monsters are your friends....."></head><body><p>Monsters Inc. is widely recognized as one of the greatest Pixar films ever made, and it's there are several reasons why. First, the premise of everyday monsters actually trying their best to scare human kids in order to raise their economy is something that is quite amusing. Kids and adults alike love the plot because it's very inventive. Also, the characters (especially Sully, Mike, and little Boo) are really likable, while the animation is spectacular and extraordinarily detailed. The effective humor is appropriate for all ages, so there's no need to feel very politically correct about this one.<br /><br />I may not be one of the biggest Pixar fans in the world, but I know a good movie when I see one. And Monsters Inc. is a GREAT movie. I fully recommend it to kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, even pets.<br /><br />Grade: 8.7/10</p></body></html>

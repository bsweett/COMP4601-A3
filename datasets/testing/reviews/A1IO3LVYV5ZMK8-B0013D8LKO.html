<meta name="summary" content="KUBRICK SAVES THE FILM WITH IMPECCABLE DIRECTING"></head><body><p>EYES WIDE SHUT is definitely not a typical Hollywood film with risque and  actions, but rather it is an accomplished film that evokes complexed and  nuanced emotions in polarized thoughts on sex, marriage and deceit. For all  the rumours of it being erotic and sexually titillating, audiences watching  it for this reason will undoubtedly be disappointed because the scenes are  hardly passionate. The drama unfolds in the glitzy New York stage which is  chillingly somber and dark, and Tom Cruise as Dr. Bill Harford finds  himself disturbed by images of infidelity after his wife, Alice (Nicole  Kidman) replayed out her fantasies. The mood of the film is serious and  surreal; Kubrick is a master at capturing the dark labyrinth and for the  questions it dissects and poses on faith and love - it is an awakening and  a moral dilemma acted out by Harford. It is adapted very simply from Arthur  Schnitzler &quot;Dream Story&quot; - the plot has no intricacies - but  rather the mood of the film overwhelms beautifully, even with Tom Cruise  trying to match his acting skills with the sublime directing. The sex  rituals are in my opinion - delicious terror that mirrors guilt and  evilness of human's heart. <p>It is controversial for the diverse and  radical thoughts in the movie - and definitely not on kinky sex. Kubrick's  directing is in fact what makes EYES WIDE SHUT miraculously alive - even it  loses grit and impetus in its last moment for the inconclusive ending. Of  course, with the directing overshadowing talented acts from Cruise and  Kidman, it is hard to see any memorable and versatile performances from  them. EYES WIDE SHUT is nonetheless a must-see for astute audiences who  sees the film for its savage beauty and provocative thoughts.</p></body></html>

This is one brief movie, so full of fights and action, you end up feeling they left in every kick-butt scene and took out some of the dialogue ones which could have given this movie more depth but hey, I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with a good dose of butt-kicking, specially when it's done this greatly, by terrific actors and for reasons you end more than caring about. Sure, everything goes just right for Neeson in his quest (it seems even Rambo would have more trouble reaching his objectives) and he definitely can't seem to be hit by any of the dozens of cars driving the opposite way or even by the hundreds of bullets shot at him but then again. Who cares ? My only 3 real complaints: 1) After substantially reducing Paris' population it seems hard to believe Neeson would be allowed to simply return home like any tourist. 2) Who ended steering the boat when Neeson took out every living soul on it?, 3) How did the Sheik know exactly which of the 3-4 girls was Neeson's daughter ?<br />7-9-09 An additional couple of complaints: 4) Liam Neeson playing his recording while investigating in the apartment, and listening to his daughter screaming out "oh my God, they took her !", when in reality she yelled this out loud before Neeson evern turned on his tape recorder and 5) Neeson takes the camera card in order to investigate its contents and it is easy to notice that the photo one of the girls took of the other outside the airport (prior to them both being photographed by the creep) is not there.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect Hollywood Movie"></head><body><p>Warner's two-disc treasure trove does justice to the quintessential Hollywood film - a 1942 wartime masterpiece in which everything clicks. "Casablanca" not only receives a splendidly restored print, but the DVD set is complemented by rare outtakes, theatrical trailers, two insightful documentaries and a 1995 Looney Tunes parody (among numerous extras). Essential cinema history.</p></body></html>

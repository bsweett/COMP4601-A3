Watching her in Glourious Hi Def!!"></head><body><p>Unlike most people, I don't have lovely memories from my childhood related to The Sound of Music. My childhood was not filled with live-action musicals (only Disney animated ones) and I just recently discovered true gems like Mary Poppins, Singin' in the Rain, My Fair Lady, The Wizard of Oz and of course this film. I saw The Sound of Music a couple of years ago and while I love the music it did not resonate as much as for example Poppins did. A friend lent his copy and after the first time, I like it but I was not overly impressed with it. Repeat viewing increased my love for the film and while its not perfect (which film is?)is so a joy to watch that now is one of my all-time favorite musicals. R&H songs are one of the many highlights and after watching the film you can't help but sing the catchy wonderful songs from it. My personal favorites are "The Sound of Music", "Maria", "My Favorite Things", "Do-Re-Mi" and "The Lonely Goatherd". I just love the songs and the scenes in which they are played. Another highlight is the beautiful scenary of the entire film. From the beginning, your spirit is uplifted with wonderful shots of European mountains, the gorgeous city of Salzburg and more. It's pure joy!! Julie Andrews of course is the power that helps the film being as wonderful as it is. Just like in Mary Poppins, Andrews is perfect for the role and does it in a way that does not feel a stereotype. Maria is a full-fledged chararacter that we all can identify with.<br /><br />Add this an array of outstading supporting characters and you have a great film. Many have blamed the film of being too sugary but I think it perfectly balances all the elements and I think we have to thank that to the actors and director Robert Wise.<br /><br />As I said before, I had a borrowed copy of the film and just when I was about to buy the 40th anniversary edition DVD, I found out that Fox is releasing a new 45th edition and in Blu-Ray!! Of course that was the way to go.<br /><br />The Sound of Music comes to hi-def looking absolutely amazing. Fox must be and should be proud of the restoration efforts. The picture looks incredibly detailed and the colors are so vibrant that you can feel the rich European scenaries. All classic films should be restored this way because it looks absolutely fantastic. Likewise, the sound has a lavish new 7.1 DTS-HD sound that's completely gorgeous. You'll just experience the film like never before. Dialogue is cristal clear, the score is great and of course the songs are amazing. Impressive sound with impressive picture, What else can you ask?<br /><br />Well, if want more, Fox has designed a new "interactive" experience called "Your favorite things" where you can see the movie with PiP content, a karaoke track and a trivia quiz. Also you have the audio-commentaries form previous editions.<br /><br />In disc two, the bonus features are divided in "Musical Stages", "A City of Song", "Vintage Programs", "Rare Treasures" and "Publicity". The first two are completely new in HD and deal with the creation of the songs,R&H partnership, the restoraton of the film, the real Von Trapp family, the Broadway Musical, The producton of the film and the locations that were used in it. The others are carried overs form previous editions but that is great becuase we have a lot of documentaries, trailers, reminiscences and much, much more. I tell you, you will need a lot of time to dive into all this material but everything is fun, informative and make you appreciate the importance of the film.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this can be easily called THE definitive edition of The Sound of Music.<br /><br />The Sound of Music is one of the best musicals in the world, and one of the most (if not the most) beloved one. It's certainly one of my favorite things. With impressive picture and sound, and a wealth of excellent bonus material, Fox has created a edition that does the film justice. If you like TSOM, there is no reason why you should not get this edition. Absolutely recommended!!</p></body></html>

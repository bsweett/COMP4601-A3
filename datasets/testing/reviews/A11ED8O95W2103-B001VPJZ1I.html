<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful indeed."></head><body><p>I probably never would have watched this movie if my wife hadn't brought it home and said something like "I got a movie for us to watch tonight".<br /><br />I found this movie gripping from the very start.  Russell Crowe's intensity got me hooked from the first scene, and mind bogglingly beautiful Jennifer Connelly kept me entranced with both her looks and her great acting right to the end.<br /><br />Without duplicating what others have written, I just want to say that to me the geniune brilliance of this movie is that is portrays a character who suffers from schizophrenia and allows us to genuinely share in his experience by thoroughly developing characters who turn out in the end to never have really existed.<br /><br />It's like he made a schizophrenic out of the viewer for the first half of the movie!  The character discovers that his roommate, the roommate's neice, and the scary Fed Spy Guy weren't real just as we the audience do.  Brilliant!  I really didn't know for a while how this story would end, and what reality really was.<br /><br />Also, as the father of a mildly autistic child, it gave me hope for his future too.  The human mind is a beautiful thing indeed, and even when it doesn't work quite right, it can self-diagnose and make corrections, and maybe solve one of the the world's problems if we just give it what it needs most, love.  Bravo!<br /><br />My only dissapointment is in the bonus material.  I wanted to learn a little more about the supporting characters, but the casting segment was just about Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connely.  That's a minor nitpick.</p></body></html>

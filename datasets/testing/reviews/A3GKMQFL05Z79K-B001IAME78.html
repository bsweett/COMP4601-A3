<meta name="summary" content="The Incredible Hulk........"Hulk SMASH!".........."></head><body><p>I'm one of those people who didn't find fault in Ang Lee's "Hulk" sometime back. I actually thought it was a pretty good movie and stayed true to the comic book mythos. Given, Ang took a few liberties here and there with things but, for the most part, it was worth going to see- to me. Other people, however, didn't think the first one was any good because of the fact that it wasn't like the TV show. Too, maybe it was the fact that there wasn't any real butt-whooping in the movie like Hulk is so big on doing in the comics. That's where the second movie comes in.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk starts off with Banner in Brazil working at a soda company and living in the slums with his dog. He tries to live a quiet life while trying to work on a cure with an online friend of his called Mr. Blue. When General Ross finds out where Banner is hiding, he takes his group of military people and goes after him. Unfortunately, things don't turn out too well. A member of that squad named Blonsky is out for blood because his squadmates didn't make it so he talks Ross into letting him stay in the loop in tracking him down. That, my friends, is when things get interesting. Without giving anything away, let's just say that Hulk gets a little more than he bargains for.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk-which was directed by Louis Leterrier(best known for Transporter 1&2)- is a more action-packed movie than its' predecessor. It moves at a brisker pace than the original and is, overall, a better movie for it. However, in my opinion, it is far from being as spectacular as the Spider-Man movies or the X-Men movies or even the recent Iron Man. It certainly has potential, though. Potential that I see Louis Leterrier expanding on if kept as the film series director. I did find several things kind of annoying concerning The Hulk in this movie. All were, basically, visual. First off, His color looked a little too dark to me. I'll admit, Ang Lee's version wasn't right either but it was more in the right direction. Second, there's not much resemblance between Banner and The Hulk when there should be. Banner's hair is brown whereas Hulk's is black.  Third, and lastly, his size isn't consistent throughout. Course, it is known that the angrier that Hulk gets, the bigger he becomes. While these are minor things, as a whole, it's those little things that make it a little less interesting to me.<br /><br />At any rate, overall, The Incredible Hulk is a great movie. Much better than the first and more rewarding on account of it. I highly recommend it. DVD extras include: An alternate opening, The Making of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, Becoming The Hulk, Becoming The Abomination, Anatomy of a Hulk Out, Hulking Out in the Bottling Plant, Hulking Out on Campus, Hulking Out in Harlem, From Comic Book to Screen, Feature Commentary With Director Louis Leterrier And Cast, and deleted scenes.<br /><br />Cast includes: Ed Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell and Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Incredible Hulk.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Some of the best special effects you'll ever see"></head><body><p>I usually don't see a film just for the special effects, but The Thing is an exception. If it's on TV, I almost always find myself watching it and waiting for the tour de force makeup by Rob Bottin (only 22 when The Thing started filming). Dogs morph into tentacled creatures, a man's chest turns into an alien creature's mouth and bites off another man's arms, a man's head splits in two and turns into a jaw with giant teeth that crush the head of another man and, in the most amazing scene of all, a man's head severs itself from it's body, sprouts spider legs and eyestalks and walks away. The effects are so good they're mesmerizing and hold up well 22 years after The Thing's release. To be sure, the film has other things going for it -- an imaginative screenplay and a great cast including Kurt Russell and veteran character actors Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Richard Masur and Donald Moffat, among others. But when the film is over, what sticks with you are the amazing effects. You just won't believe what you see onscreen.</p></body></html>

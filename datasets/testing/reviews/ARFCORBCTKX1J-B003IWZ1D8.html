Let's add a second gasp... GASP!!! Squared.<br /><br />This is one of the finest home-video transfers I've ever seen. It beggars description. It's subjectively perfect -- not one scratch, piece o' dust, or blemish of any kind. And it appears that little or no edge enhancement or grain reduction has been used, a problem with too many Universal transfers. (Slight grain is visible when standing near the screen.) I assume the transfer was made from the composite negative, but no information is given.<br /><br />Even more importantly, "Psycho" /looks/ quite different. I have never been so aware of how beautifully detailed and near-palpable the image is. Hitch couldn't have seen it better on the set. And the detail doesn't hide the fact that "Psycho" is not an example of "lush" B&W cinematography. I wouldn't call it "clinical", but -- /except/ where appropriate -- it has a matter-of-fact quality that fits the subject matter. More than ever, one is aware of the contrast between the plainness of "the outside world" and the "decorative fussiness" of Mrs Bates' home and furnishings.<br /><br />Watching it on a 60" plasma display, I felt I was sitting about 2/3 back in the theater, seeing "Psycho" with the sort of detail and clarity one /never/ sees in a theater. (I saw it "new" 50 years ago, and there is no comparison.)<br /><br />As for the film... One critic said that American films could be divided into "pre-Psycho" and "post-Psycho". "Psycho" is one of the most-influential films ever made, and was one of the first (if not the first) in a string of standards-stretching films that would bring an end to the Production Code eight years later and its replacement by the current ratings system. The hyprocisy of the Hayes Office was shown by allowing Marion and Sam to engage in sex without the benefit of marriage -- which didn't matter, because less than an hour later, she was punished for it. Nor did the Vegamatic scene seem to bother the censors. They were more worried about the toilet in the bathroom, which appears to be the first time a sanitary appliance was shown in an American film. "Psycho" received its Production Code Seal, and American parents actually took their kids to see it (as mine did). (Though "Psycho" was at one time rated GM (PG), it is now correctly rated R.)<br /><br />There were dissenters, of course. "The American Fascist Review", which, even in 1960, had long been complaining about the lewdness and immorality of American films, nearly went Postal over "Psycho" -- though I have to admit that its complaint about parents taking their children to this film had /some/ justification.<br /><br />Hitchcock was a master at getting the audience to identify with characters we're not /supposed/ to identify with. You /feel/ Marian's guilt about stealing the money, and when her car stops sinking in the swamp (to intentionally comic sound effects), you /want/ it to continue sinking so that Norman's mother won't be hauled away by the police. NO ONE has ever manipulated an audience the way Hitchcock does -- he saw it as the basic thing a director "does" -- so is it any wonder he's still called The Master? We /know/ Hitch is manipulating us -- and we love it.<br /><br />It really needs to be driven home that "Psycho" set a standard that hasn't been surpassed. Most (though not all, of course) post-"Psycho" attempts at making suspense and horror films are pathetic.<br /><br />A /lot/ has to be said about Anthony Perkins' performance, which simultaneously cemented and ruined his career. It's another one of those "Why didn't he get an Oscar nomination?" performances that litter Hollywood's history. He manages to be simultaneously frightening and pathetic, and believeably fluctuates between the normal and the weird. It's vastly superior to Anthony Hopkins' turn as Hannibal Lecter, which is a largely one-note performance that nevertheless won Hopkins an Oscar. Seeing this magnificent transfer on a large display makes it easier to appreciate the subtleties of Perkins' and Leigh's performances.<br /><br />I could spend a whole review on just Bernard Herrmann's music. Unlike most modern scores, it's not a continual background drone. Herrmann put music where /he/ thought it was needed, so it plays an important role in establishing mood and character. Note (no pun intended) how effectively the music mirrors Marian's turmoil when she's packing to leave -- she hasn't quite made up her mind whether to steal the money -- and when she's driving.<br /><br />Though Herrmann generally steered clear of the string section (his scores tend to focus on the brass and woodwinds), this, his most-famous score, is /all/ strings -- "a B&W sound for a B&W movie", as he said. It's rare these days for a score to even remotely approach the quality of a Herrmann score -- composers seem deathly afraid of writing anything that might attract the viewer's attention. Hitchcock attributed 1/3 of the film's success to the score, but this compliment runs both ways -- Hitchock /gave/ Herrmann a film he could write highly effective music for. When William Friedkin told Herrmann he wanted "a score as good as Psycho's" for "The Exorcist", Bennie, in his inimitably blunt manner, said "Give me a /film/ as good as Psycho".<br /><br />An absolute necessity for any Blu-ray collection, in a transfer that -- for once -- matches the quality of the film.<br /><br />PS: Let's get this straight, once and for all... "Peeping Tom" is /not/ a "British 'Psycho'". It's a piece of Emetic Cheeseburger &lt;stuff> (you can't use the C word in Amazon reviews) that doesn't come within light years of "Psycho". There, I said it. Take /that/, Martin Scorsese.</p></body></html>

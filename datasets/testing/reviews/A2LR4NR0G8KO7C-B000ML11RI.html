After a couple of action scenes<br /><br />with Mickey Rourke you'll just look at the violence as if it is fun like Tom and Jerry. When you reach that mood the cartoon based movie is definetely nice to watch, especially with so many colourful characters being there. However Sin City should<br /><br />have been at least 30 minutes shorter as Rodriguez needs to use his brilliant trick with the violence for 3 story lines. After the second story line his trick I would have liked to see something else, but this is where the movie let me dow a little. (SARR)</p></body></html>

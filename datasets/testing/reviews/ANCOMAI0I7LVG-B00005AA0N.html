I'm sure that, at the time of its release, `Patton' was a stellar film.  In fact, I know it was.  The film won seven Academy Awards (although, I know of a recent Oscar winning film that wasn't stellar upon its release, so I guess the Oscar's are not the perfect judge of quality) and has been hailed as one of the best biographical war movies of all time.<br /><br />I don't know, to me, it just felt `cheap'.<br /><br />Despite a blisteringly good performance by George C. Scott (I really love this guy as an actor, for he can really do just about anything), the film falters for me in scope and construction.  While the development of Patton himself is quite good, I found that everything going on around him felt cluttered, sloppy, confusing, rushed and, well, cheap.<br /><br />And I totally understand the detractors that call this movie boring, for at nearly three hours it does ride at a slow pace for the most part.<br /><br />While I am not a huge fan of war films to begin with, I am a very big fan of the biopic and an even bigger fan of the slow, brooding character study.  Sadly, even my patience was tested in parts.  Some films really stretched themselves and delivered something that was `ahead of its time'.  `Patton' is the type of film that feels outdated by the time the decade was over.  It feels like a poorly made `Television Movie' to me, and that is never good.<br /><br />When you consider the types of war films that came out in the late 70's you have to wonder why this particular film wasn't...better.<br /><br />Still, George C. Scott is a marvel here, and his performance does elevate the film in many areas.  As much as I wanted to end my viewing early on many occasions, it was Scott who kept me glued to the television.  `Patton' is far from a great film (as one friend once said to me, great movies are the ones that `hold up' over time) but it sports an astonishing performance and does carry with it some intriguing history.  It is a film that is worth watching at least once.  I understand good and well that entertainment and the enjoyment it brings is purely subjective, and our own personal situations, emotional crutches and whatnot all play a big part in what we find enjoyable, moving and shapes what we consider masterpieces.  So, I totally understand why so many adore this film.<br /><br />I hope that you can understand why I didn't.</p></body></html>

In the deep woods, a traveler named Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda find an abandoned cabin and accidentally unleashes an unspeakable evil force from the pages of the Necronomicon, the ancient Book of the Dead. Now, Ash must resist this strange evil's brutal torments in order to save his soul and send the evil force back to where it came from. Director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man 1 & 2) horror spectacle is an amazing combination of creepy stylish horror and hilarious slapstick comedy. "Evil Dead 2" is more of a big budget remake of the original "Evil Dead" (1982) than a sequel. Its storyline progresses smoothly and offers some good scares and very entertaining moments. The cult favorite contains some terrific camerawork, effective visuals effects, immense laughs and memorable gross-out scenes. Bruce Campbell's vivid performance as unlikely hero Ash is another good highlight of the 1987 film.<br /><br />For fans of the horror genre, "Evil Dead II" is a highly recommended purchase. The cult 1987 favorite is presented in both standard full screen and 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen formats. Its picture quality is reasonably sharp with good contrast. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is rather enjoyable with lively surround effects. This DVD contains a detailed audio commentary with filmmaker Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell and production crew, the amusing 30-minute "The Gore the Merrier" behind-the-scenes documentary, still galleries, original theatrical trailer and a short preview of "Evil Dead: Hail to the King" video game. The animated menus are excellent. Overall, "Evil Dead II" scores a surprising "B+".</p></body></html>

It is a lot of fun and I almost didn't see it due to the harsh critical pounding this movie has been taking. It isn't as good as X-Men 2 or Batman Begins, but I prefer it over Hulk and the Spiderman films. The acting and special effects are good, but both are lacking at times. Jessica Alba is one of the hottest women on the planet and is a nice visual treat that makes up for her decent acting skills. The Human Torch and The Thing were both great in the acting department (loved the back and forth trash talk) and were the best characters in my opinion. Mr. Fantastic was a boring nerd, but that is what his part called for and he played it well. Dr. Doom was much better than expected and I liked the fact that the actor didn't overact the part to the degree that we are use to in comic book films. Go see this film with low expectations and you will be surprised big time. This is a worthy addition to the Marvel movie franchise.</p></body></html>

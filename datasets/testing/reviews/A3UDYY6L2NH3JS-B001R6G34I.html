<meta name="summary" content="The archetype of so many films"></head><body><p>That's the archetype of Beauty and the Beast. The Beast is a surviving creature from antedeluvian, prehistoric times. A monster, a Beast by its size and its looks : it is nothing but a big chimpazee or gorilla. But that Beast is the ancestor of man and has feelings. The Beast is surviving as a god for some primitive tribe in the Pacific Ocean and he is transported into New York as some kind of grotesque exhibit in a show on Broadway. Civilization appears as trying to make a profit out of nature and its inhabitants. It turns sour because the Beast is in love with the main actress who was offered to him by the primitive tribe. We just need to get the Beast on top of the Empire State Building, its most famous achievement of all, for the film to be complete. But the Beast can only inspire curiosity when securely tied up and fear when at large. So the Beast, another archetype, has to be put to death without any more thinking about. Beauty and the Beast, the giant wild creature, its love for the beautiful blond woman, its final destruction and we have the pattern of many films that will come afterwards, even the pattern of some horror or burlesque films of today. As such this film is essential in the American cinema.<p>...</p></body></html>

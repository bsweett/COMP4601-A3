<meta name="summary" content="A skillfully made thriller"></head><body><p>THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tightly conceived, well directed, well photographed and particularly well acted suspense thriller loosely based on the Robert Ludlum best seller.  True, many liberties have been taken from the novel, but when you take the time to note that Ludlum himself is the producer, then all arguments are off.  Matt Damon and Franka Potente are terrific as the amnesiac agent and his 'only friend' who helps him escape a mad and endless chase from multiple groups of would be assassins.  The characters are well developed - Damon gives one of his better perfomances, doing most of his stunt work himself while Potente continues to prove she is an actress worth watching.  The supporting cast of such fine actors as Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, etc help propel this movie along.  Outside of the French Connection this is one of the best car chases ever filmed - gratefully without the now-boring background of explosions and destruction.  In all a fine film that is delivered on DVD with interesting  and informative sidebars.</p></body></html>

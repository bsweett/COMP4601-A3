And if we don't take care of our planet the way "They" think we should, they're going to beam a few galaxies over and zap us?  And, to be spared, all we as a human race need is a tearful Jennifer Connelly to plead, "We can change!  Trust us!"  If all of the above floats your ecco-friendly boat, then by all means pull up a chair and watch this hapless remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.<br /><br />Now they did get the lead role right; no other actor can bring a blank, disinterested, often clueless expression to a gig like Keanu Reeves.  But after awhile not even Reeves's sophomoric ambivalence can salvage a story spinning steadfastly into a cosmic black hole of utter nonsense.  From the silly antics of Gort the Indestructible Robot to a Kathy Bates-led military obsessed with blowing everything up to a swarm of metallic termites (no, I haven't been drinking, but this film sure tempts me) gobbling up matter like freshmen around a keg, this is a (forgettable) film screaming to be ignored.<br /><br />The special effects?  Eh.  Okay.  Pretty good.  But even a supermodel needs substance; at least, every once in awhile.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL lacks substance, and tries to overcompensate with lots of nonsense.  Blech.  Beam me up, Scotty.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

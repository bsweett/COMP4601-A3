<meta name="summary" content="FRANKENSTEIN 2010!"></head><body><p>Being a huge fan of the 1931 classic 'Frankenstein', I couldn't help but find some sort of homage to the famous gothic horror tale watching this film. 'Splice' does what so many other horror films try to do and fail, it actually evokes fear! Watching this film today, I can only imagine the shock Frankenstein had on the movie going public back in 1931. This film is shocking, controversial and will certainly put some viewers off with its themes of blasphemy, bestiality, incest and rape! I had to deduct one star because the two scientist were incredibly stupid and the film just couldn't seem to shake it's "monster on the loose" origins in the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chopin saves lives..."></head><body><p>Such a deeply moving film, I can barely find words to capture the intensity.  As a lover of classical piano, I always considered Chopin to be for the ear, not the heart, very flowery, exhibitionist type expression.  The tortureous plot of human and art are so majestically entertwined and elevated to beyond heavenly by films end. This tour de force is one of the most intimate in my experience. More than HIGHLY recommend!</p></body></html>

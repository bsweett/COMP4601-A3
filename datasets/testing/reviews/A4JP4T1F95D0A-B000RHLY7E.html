House seemed like Rob was trying to cram a million differant horror ideas into one movie, this story seems really focused and intense.  If you like murder and mayhem, this is for you.  Rob seems to relish in lingering over the death and destruction.  This is a very violent film, so gore hounds will be real happy with this one.  Any fan of Three's Company may recognize Terry(Priscilla Barnes) who gets naked in the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Only Good Sequel To The Classic Original"></head><body><p>After the original "Halloween" film turned into the "little independent film that could" and ultimately set the standard for horror films for nearly two decades, John Carpenter and crew got back together in 1981 to churn out a sequel.  Though the entire Halloween franchise is now mocked for the absurdity of its installments, this is the only one that manages to maintain some of the magic of the original.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Halloween II" picks right up where the first one left off.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is being taken to the local hospital, while Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still trying to hunt down the psychopathic (and seemingly indestructible) Michael Myers.  When Myers finds out where Strode is being held, it sets up a final confrontation between the three.<br /><br />What I really have to give the "Halloween II" writers credit for is the foresight to realize that their shtick could only go so far.  They managed to created a taut, highly-suspenseful sequel to one of the most original films of all-time, and chose to "end" (if only they would have known...) the series while it was still going strong.<br /><br />This movie succeeds because it is basically just an extension of the first.  Michael is still terrifying, the jump-scenes still cause your heart to uproot, and the drama is still palpable.  Does it completely capture the mojo of the 1978 edition?  Not quite; but it comes closer than most horror flick "part two's".  There is a bit more gore and a little less innocence in this installment, but overall it is a very fitting continuation of the overall storyline.<br /><br />Thus, watch this film with confidence knowing that you won't be let down (this time...I can't say the same for the rest of the sequels).  If you're having that Halloween movie marathon on October 31st, make sure this one goes right into the DVD player after the original.</p></body></html>

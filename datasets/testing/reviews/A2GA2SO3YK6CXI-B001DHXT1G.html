<meta name="summary" content="Incredible Hulk"></head><body><p>The incredible Hulk brings back our green superhero, now masterfully played by Edward Norton. The first time we saw Edward Norton on the big screen he was playing a key role alongside Richard Gear in Primal Fear. Norton was so amazing in his performance that we have become fans of his.<br /><br />Here, Norton plays Bruce Banner, a scientist that travels fast from place to place, avoiding detection by those who want to turn what he carries inside into a powerful weapon. We find him working and surviving among the thousands that live in the Fabellas of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where from a bottling company, he is in communication with a US scientist, attempting to eliminate the effects of the military experiment that has transformed him into an enormous creature, capable of anything, with a powerful force that can send automobiles into the air as if they were Frisbees.<br /><br />Bruce is also learning the art of self control while receiving training on how to lower his heart rate through breathing and muscle exercises. When his heart rate is fast, he transforms, so we see him struggle to keep it low and to control emotions such as passion, rage, anger and love.<br /><br />William Hurt plays the part of General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, the man responsible for the project that has left Bruce in his present condition and who is after Bruce so he can make many just like him. The General also happens to be the father of the girl Bruce is in love with; Betty, played by Liv Tyler.<br /><br />The General is unable to capture Bruce in Brazil and Bruce escapes. We see him next in Guatemala, where a farmer finds him shivering in the cold of the jungle and takes him into town. There we see a rather funny scene as Bruce acquires clothing that can stretch as he transforms into the Hulk and because he can't determine the size... he tests it against the bottom of a rather large female that stands behind him.<br /><br />Next, he returns to the USA in search for a solution from the scientist he has been corresponding with, and when he finds him, he realizes that the doctor has kept samples and has test subjects that can progress the experiment. By now, the General has enlisted the help of an older soldier who seems to be capable of anything and wants nothing but to remain a fighter. This soldier confronted the Hulk back in Brazil and dreams of being able to fight against him, so he agrees to undergo experiments to see if he too can transform into a powerful "abomination."<br /><br />The scenes that follow are amazing, the fights a bit contrived, but the pace of this movie is wonderful as we go from place to place following the struggle between the two monsters. Hulk is simply a movie worth seeing and a wonderful resurfacing of one of our favorite superheroes. One of the most appreciated moments were when the producer provided cameo appearances by Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Robert Downey, Jr. bringing all our favorite superheroes together. Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

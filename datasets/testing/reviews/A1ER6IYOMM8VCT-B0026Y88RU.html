<meta name="summary" content="GOOD BUT, UNEVEN!  COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT!"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that is really frustrating to watch. You have some great actors like Freeman,Kingsley and Willis who are interesting to watch and then you have some not so great actors like Lui and Hartnett who are not very interesting to watch. The story is good but, the love affair between Hartnett and Lui takes up way too much screen time in this otherwise good action film. I understand the purpose of the relationship between them but, it seemed to switch the tone of the movie from violent gangster film to a romantic comedy at times. Hartnett getting his nose broken twice was just too much for me and those kind of "yuk yuk" jokes should have been left out of this grisly tale of revenge. As it is, it's a good film but, it could have been great!</p></body></html>

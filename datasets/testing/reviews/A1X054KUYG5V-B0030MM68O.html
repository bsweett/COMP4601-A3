<meta name="summary" content="Has its moments even if it's distinctly overrated"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is a decent film with a persuasive performance by Jeremy Renner in the lead, but long after it has convinced us of its central premise ("war is a drug") it keeps pounding the point home, leading to a running length that feels padded and several moments in which the pace slows to a crawl; I *wanted* to like this movie as much as everyone else but aside from the opening and closing action sequences it lacks tension and is certainly not the best film of 2009.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pitt and Jolie force their relationship into a boring Mr. and Mrs. Smith"></head><body><p>Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Troy) and Angelina Jolie (Alexander, Shark Tale) star as Mr. John and Mrs. Jane Smith who, at the beginning of the movie are at a marraige counselour for what you say, oh, there isnt any erotic heat between the 2 of them anymore. Then it goes on to showing how the 2 met in Bogota Columbia, how they fell in love and how 5 or 6 years later after their married, both find out that they are assassins...hmmm..what makes it even worse is that they were sent to whack each other off, not the target they both were after. So, the 2 try to kill each other, punching each other, shooting at each other, slapping, smashing each others heads into a wall or glass and in the end they find that their getting off on the fact their trying to kill one another...interesting. Doug Liman, has done comedy and action before but this is the first time he has meshed those 2 categories together which let's down some of the fun. The fact of the matter is, is that both stars have their moments but for me, it doesnt cut it at all. Vince Vaughn (Swingers, Wedding Crashers) who plays Pitt's boss is best out of the wasted supporting characters, who lives with his mom still ("Mom, I almost just killed you right there!). Adam Brody (Grind, TV'S THE O.C) wearing a Fight Club t-shirt when the man who starred in it was sitting across from him, yeah, ok. Another thing I hated was that it got to boring when they would find guns in hidden compartments...I mean, enough already. Also starring Kerry Washington (She Hate Me, Ray). Actor Keith David (Pitch Black) played Jolie's mystery boss and Actor William Fichtner (GO, The Longest Yard) was the voice of the marraige counselor.</p></body></html>

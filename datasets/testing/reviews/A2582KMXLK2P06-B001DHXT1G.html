<meta name="summary" content="green hulk"></head><body><p>I was never into comic books or super heroes or any of that stuff.  I just never found it interesting as a kid so I wasn't going into this movie with high hopes or expecting a classic.  If anything, I expected another movie similar to King Kong, and well, that's sort of what the Incredible Hulk is.<br /><br />A big jolly green monster jumping around through the streets with a nasty attitude that suddenly develops whenever he turns big and green and scary.  It's like you can't be big and strong with a positive and welcoming attitude.<br /><br />He is more than capable of picking up vehicles and throwing them through the air, and that's also his main thing- picking up cars and slamming them down.  He does this quite a bit throughout the movie, and while I was already aware of his car-slamming techniques before watching the movie despite not knowing much about the Incredible Hulk character, it's good to know those little details were included in the movie.<br /><br />Also, there was plenty of action that kept me interested, such as TWO mega hulks grabbing a helicopter with a hot woman inside and trying to bring it down.  They eventually did.<br /><br />I knew there would be plenty of special effects and the film certainly delivers in that area.  Though one thing that kind of bugs me is how the regular guy keeps turning into the Hulk character while inside a dark area, so you don't actually see the transformation very often.  You almost do in one scene, and I appreciated that, but other than that one part I can't remember getting the opportunity to see him turn into the green monster.<br /><br />So what do we have as a final thought?  Well, like I said, I don't know much about all these fictional character heroes, but this movie did keep me watching it until the end, something most movies fail to do these days.</p></body></html>

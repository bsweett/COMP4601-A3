<meta name="summary" content="A gritty ride with a cold and calculating heroine who is hard to figure out"></head><body><p>Salt is a very gritty and violent action thriller from 2010, and while it has a sparing amount of crude language, be prepared for a heavy dose of death.  We've seen the likes of this before, and usually there's some redemptive qualities that help make the level of violence more palatable.  In this case the female protagonist Evelyn Salt proves to be a cold blooded emotionless killer, and we see quite a trail of bodies in her wake.  The plot is quite suspenseful, because we're never entirely sure what side she and her surrounding cast are on.  The notion of sleeper agents is particularly interesting, but there are a few big holes in the story (e.g. why does Olsov go to CIA headquarters to blow Salt's cover?  Why doesn't she seem to know what he is talking about, but then cooperate fully with his plan?).  By the end you're left thinking that it was an okay ride, but not one you'd ever want to take a second time, or maybe even a first time. - GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

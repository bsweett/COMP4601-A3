<meta name="summary" content="Naturally there is conflict, followed by a predictable plot"></head><body><p>This western was directed by Kevin Costner, who also stars in it along with Robert Duvall.  They are cast as "open range" cattlemen.  They live outdoors and move their cattle from place to place.  They hate towns and townspeople hate them.  Naturally there is conflict.  And naturally the plot is predictable.<p> <p>Robert Duvall is the boss of the small group of men who work on the open range.  He's a fine actor and I've seen him do some incredible work in other films.  But there were moments here when his performance seemed actually wooden.  Kevin Costner does a somewhat better job.  He's a gunman who has "done some things I'm not very proud of" in the Civil war.  However, it was quite noticeable that he never mentioned what side he fought on.  Then there is Abraham Benrubi, who I recognized as playing Jerry, the large-size hospital clerk in "ER. He adds a tough of humanity and humor.  And then there is Diego Luna who plays a 16-year-old who the older men have taken under their wing.  Annette Bening is the female lead.  She looks pretty and has a gentle sophistication.  No wonder Kevin Costner falls in love.  Both of them are aging, and they make mention of it.  <p> <p>This is a film about bad guys and good guys.  There are lots of gunfights, but even though men fall down and die, the violence is of the old-fashioned movie variety and we don't see blood and guts.  Filmed in Canada, the scenery is nice and gives a feel of old west as we've seen it done over and over again.  Surprisingly, however, I wasn't bored.  Sometimes, I guess I'm just in the mood for a slow-moving predictable western.</p></body></html>

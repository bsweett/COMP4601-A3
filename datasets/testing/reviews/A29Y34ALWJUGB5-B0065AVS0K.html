<meta name="summary" content="The Special Edition Sin City"></head><body><p>I found this a very difficult movie to rate. I wanted so badly to give it a five because of the movie itself, but I also wanted to give the Unrated edition a three for the package, as it is very disappointing. So, I settled on a solid four. Here's why.<br /><br />Firstly, Sin City as a movie alone was excellent. It was innovative and almost as good as my absolute favorite movie Pulp Fiction, and this I believe is because the two are so much alike. Sin City doesn't even try to explain itself. The characters ramble on in moments of deep thought, revealing what makes them tick. It's filled to the brim with Arnold-esque one-liners. The surreal style of this film makes all the characters seem like super heroes of sorts (not strange, considering Frank Miller, the god of American comics, created this series). In fact, everything that happens in this movie would make other movies bad. Who wants to listen to the thoughts of a character, something that's usually left in books? Yet in Sin City it words. Who still likes Arnold one-liners, what with all those Arnold impressions going on anymore? Obviously, Frank Miller, and so do his fans. Who wants surrealism in their movies? Anyone who likes super hero movies, which record tells a lot of people. All this comes together to make Sin City the all-time greatest comic-book movie.<br /><br />Now, for the Sin City Uncut edition, the only true bonus here is the graphic novel, which I have yet to read myself (review coming later). It gives you the chance to see just how innovative the movie Sin City is, and how true the directors wanted to keep the movie to the book. After that, there is little to keep my interest. Some of the special features found here should have been included in the first edition of Sin City, which I foolishly wasted my money on not knowing this edition was coming. Plus, unless you watch both versions of the movie back to back, you'll never be able to tell which scenes were added. The breakdown of stories so that you can watch them singularly doesn't add anything. It's jarring, actually, since it breaks the rhythm the original version followed.<br /><br />In the end, I can't recommend this movie to anyone who has the original version. If you don't have that version, however, pick this up quick. It is still a superior version, only not by much.</p></body></html>

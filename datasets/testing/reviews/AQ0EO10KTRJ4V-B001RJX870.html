<meta name="summary" content="Excellent !!!"></head><body><p>I must admit I rarely have the patience to sit thru a subtitled movie, but DOWNFALL is so well done, I did not mind and I think hearing 100% German in relation to the time period and subject helped reinforce the realism.<br /><br />Whenever a movie can make you (even for the briefest of seconds) forget you are watching a movie and really get pulled in, then it succeeds.<br /><br />Downfall does this superbly.<br /><br />On the otherhand, garbage like Hollywood's "PEARL HARBOR" from a few years back looks and "feels" like a Hollywood set and movie and you never really "believe" you are in 1945.<br /><br />With DOWNFALL you can almost get the sense you are in the bunker with Hitler and the SS during the Final Days.</p></body></html>

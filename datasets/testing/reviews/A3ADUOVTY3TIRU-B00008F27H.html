<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek returns for 1st movie"></head><body><p>The other special edition Trek movies that recently came out are loaded with extras too, but nothing like this DVD. I love the TV spots and the documentaries! Great nostalgia and awesome interviews! Notably absent from the interviews is Leonard Nimoy. Also I had no idea they had plans to make another Trek series back in the mid seventies. They even show test shots of the would be new cast (featuring Persis Khambatta who would have played Ilia on the show!) and the new sets on this DVD! Very interesting stuff! They were way ahead of their time. TNG was still over 10 years away from being made at this point.<br /><br />Star Trek The Next Generation "borrows" a lot from this movie. From the intellectual story telling, the theme song, the uniforms, and Jonathan Frakes owes his career as Riker to Commander Decker.<br /><br />This movie has been labeled a "bomb", but critics should know that this movie was the 3rd highest grossing movie of 1979 and it came out in December of that year! It made more money than the original Alien and Apocalypse Now! Both of those movies are considered classics. The new CG shots are amazing! They really add to the film! V'Ger is no longer just a cloud in space, but is now a massive probe looking for it's creator! The only drawback to this version is there is 7 minutes cut out. I would've liked to have seen maybe an egg (like T2) where you can watch the original version and/or the television version. But that is a minor point.<br /><br />So, just relax (forget the MTV flashy edit style movies of today) and indulge yourself in this bit of Star Trek history!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A major disappointment"></head><body><p>I'm probably the only person who thought this was a dull, boring, pointless, and largely unsuccessful, movie. That's because a film that is merely a grossfest of bizarre atrocities, because it needs to surpass the level of weirdness of the original movie to lure people back, but which lacks any sensible plot to tie it all together, not to mention much else in the way of redeeming aesethetic or other qualities, such as scientific accuracy, is still a dull, boring, uninteresting movie.<p>I wanted to say something more on the medical info, some of which is wildly off-base. This will require my waxing a little technical, so I apologize for that in advance, but I feel obligated to point out that several things in this movie are total nonsense.<p>I'm not a medical doctor, but my masters and doctoral work was in neurobiology, and I do know something about that, and it's highly unlikely someone would cut off their face while on poppers, if that's what Lector gave the Gary Oldman character. There wouldn't be enough anesthesia.<p>Oddly enough, there is a way this could happen, but it's a very rare neurological condition. These people lack a certain type of pain nerves. Mothers with this condition have been known to go into labor without knowing it and had the babies fall out on the kitchen floor--not good.<p>These people are born missing one of the two main neural pain pathways, known as the paleospinal-thalamic tract, or spinal lemniscus for pain. The other pain pathway we have for pain is the neospinalthalamic tract, which is for so-called epicritic pain, which are basically sharp, pinprick-type sensations, as opposed to protopathic pain, which are more dull, aching, type of pain sensations. But if I'm remembering my neurology correctly, it's the former one that's involved in this condition. But nothing in the movie suggests a connection with this strange neurological condition.<p>Well, I didn't mean to get into the technical minutia on all this, but movie-makers have a certain obligation not to desseminate crapola. I also doubt that there has ever been a case like Hannibal the Cannibal. Obviously, he's a fiction or construct, perhaps a combination of several real-life people (such as the Harvard Law School Professor, Kingsley, was in the movie, Paper Chase), but I didn't even mind that too much. The movie revolves around Hannibal's bizarre psychology, which, although they never do explain it very well, is really the only interesting thing in the entire movie, and if they didn't have him, they wouldn't even have a movie at all.<p>Finally, the scene with the hog was lifted from a much earlier Thomas Harris book from about 15 or so years ago, called Red Dragon, which is about a different character than Hannibal Lector. But I didn't even mind that too much, as the hog was probably the best actor in the movie (and I usually like Anthony Hopkins).<p>There are other things I could criticize about this movie, but as this is already a pretty long review I'll leave it at that. You might think I'm one of those hypercritical, nitpicky reviewers who love to find fault with everything, but in fact I'm actually very easily entertained when it comes to movies, and usually I'm not very uncritical of them.<p>This movie completes the parallels between the Roman Coliseum gladiatorial games and Hollywood's film output. Next thing you know we'll be having our own version of the gladiatorial games with the same events the Romans had--gladiators hacking at each other, political and religious dissidents being eaten by lions, and naked boys having to chase and catch porcupines with their bare hands.<p>If you like pointless voyeuristic grossfests almost completely lacking in any other redeeming cinematic qualities, then this movie is for you.</p></body></html>

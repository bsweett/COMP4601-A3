Just the facial expressions and body language Depp employs for his role alone, shows his immense talent as a skilled actor.<br /><br />2) The costuming, make-up, set design, lighting and cinematography are phenomenal for this movie and look very realistic..... especially for the character of Davy Jones and his crew.<br /><br />3) Phenomenal computer generated scenes with the kraken/squid attacking the pirates ships at sea.... It is truly amazing how far computer generated scenes have come.<br /><br />I think what was a deterrent for me in terms of watching this movie and why I didn't rate it as "5 stars" was because:<br /><br />1) This movie's storyline dragged out way too long. I felt that a lot of the scenes were just used as fillers/fluff to stretch out the movie and make it longer..... Along with showing off all of the special effects that may be employed today. I think this movie would have made a lot more sense to the viewer in terms of the storyline, if it could have been made shorter.<br /><br />2) This movie was reminiscent of the Jules Verne novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.<br /><br />3) Keira Knightley can't act. Sure she makes nice eye candy, but that is about it. I think that some other actress with better talent should have been cast in the role of Elizabeth Swann.</p></body></html>

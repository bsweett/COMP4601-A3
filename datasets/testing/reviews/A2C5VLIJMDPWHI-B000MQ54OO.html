From the preview alone, I wanted to see the Grandmaster Flash rendition of the song, done by a penguin.  The voice alone was adorable.  I just wanted to hang out with my nephews, tried to find a movie we could all get into, and was caught offguard at how interested I became in the plot of this one.<br /><br />Overview: The main character is a penguin who has been ostracized from his peers and family because he cannot sing, like all other penguins (apparently) always have been able to.  But, he can juke with the best of them.  Unfortunately, his peers are not entertained by his gift and abandon him repeatedly.  He finds comfort by branching off on his own and finding other penguins who appreciate his unique style.  On his journey to find companionship, he meets another penguin and some other birds who have seen "aliens" from other places.  Now, when the "aliens" are introduced, this is when the grown-ups will start really paying attention.  The "aliens" leave litter behind that is affecting the health of the penguins, take massive amounts of food from the water and leave the penguins starving, capture birds to put in aquariums, and/or attach mechanical devices to their bodies for research.  Sound familiar?  It should.  Being a vegetarian who despises anything that emprisons living beings and completely annoyed by people who litter, I wanted to dance my happy feet for this movie having such great principles.  But I managed to remain seated and bounce around in my seat during all the incredibly adorable pop/hip-hop/R&B routines.  Eventually, the main penguin goes off on a search to find food for his family, finds out more information on the "aliens" and the "aliens" find out that penguins are living on this land.<br /><br />I won't tell the end, but I was very pleased with the outcome.  It wasn't so much about the principles mentioned above (litter and lack of food for an animal's natural habitat), but also because the elders of this penguin are so against change.  They are annoyed that the main penguin cannot sing like the rest and that he seems so unapologetic about it, and instead wants to show off his ability to (tap)dance.  Besides them not appreciating his gift, they try to make everyone else abandon him too, which is so relatable to anyone who has experienced differences, be it race, religion, education, politics, physical appearance, etc.  I liked the message it sent to kids.  Try to look at differences in your peers as a learning experience instead of a threat, because the peer who is different may be the one who can help you in ways you can't imagine.<br /><br />P.S.  The animation in this movie was great. I jumped when the sharks and seals came, and I wanted to reach out and hug the main penguin. He just looked so soft and pretty.  What a great movie!  I think I liked it more than my nephews, regardless of those two tap dancing past the nachos and popcorn all the way to the exit doors.</p></body></html>

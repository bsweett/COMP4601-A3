<meta name="summary" content="Horror Movie Played For Laughs; Extremely Entertaining"></head><body><p>This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.<br /><br />My main complaint is that there are not enough lulls. There is too much action, and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!<br /><br />Whatever,  I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campbell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times over but within seconds, he's back to normal. Campbell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making wild faces in a movie, more than Jim Carrey. However, this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence, as mainly a tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. At least that's the way I saw it.<br /><br />Now that's out on Blu-Ray, I have to check it out again.</p></body></html>

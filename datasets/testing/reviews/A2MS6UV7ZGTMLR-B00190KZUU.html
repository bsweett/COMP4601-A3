<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton does it again!"></head><body><p>Can there be any other director who has carved such a perfect niche for himself as Tim Burton? The undoubted master of the "adult fairytale" tackles the issue of the relationship between Father and Son in the film 'Big Fish'. With an impressive cast including Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup and Jessica Lange - oh, and not forgetting "Mrs Burton" (Helena Bonham Carter) - 'Big Fish' is set up to succeed from the get-go. What Burton has created is a humorous and yet moving journey through the fantastic life of one Edward Bloom as retold through a series of flashbacks. The film strongly evokes memories of the equally surreal 'Edward Scissorhands' and the gently comedic fictional biopic 'Forrest Gump'.<br />This film is a heart-warming, funny and quite mesmerising tale. There is something strangely homely about Burton's 'Big Fish' - it is one of those films that makes you reassess some of your own relationships. The acting is of a high calibre throughout - I thought Lange's performance as the loving wife of Bloom was wonderfully understated in particular. The supporting actors include the superb Steve Buscemi and Burton's old mate Danny De Vito. I did have a couple of minor gripes in this regard however - Finney's delivery is sometimes mumbled or slurred to an extent that I could not make out what he was saying (this could have been intentional, but was irritating nonetheless) and McGregor's Alabama accent was jarring. It's not that he didn't carry it off, but for an actor who has such a characteristic accent of his own (Sean Connery anyone?), the fake southern drawl did take a little while for me to feel comfortable with it.<br />This story will make you laugh and will warm the cockles of all but the most hard-hearted viewer. Highly recommended as a film for those prepared to sit back, suspend disbelief, relax and enjoy the ride. If you have seen some of Burton's other work ('Sleepy Hollow', 'Beetlejuice' or 'Edward Scissorhands' for instance), you may be one of those people who feel they are just a little too weird...possibly a little too contrived. Have no fear if that is the case. Whilst this bears the undeniable Burton stamp, it is probably his most accessible - dare I say mainstream - film. Very nice work indeed.</p></body></html>

It garnered six Tonys including Best Musical, Actress (Mary Martin) and Featured Actress (Patricia Neway) and was nominated for four more. Robert Wise's 1965 film adaptation eliminates three songs but adds two. IMDB incorrectly reports that Portia Nelson appeared both on stage and in the movie. No original Broadway cast members are in the film.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Postulant Maria Rainer is having trouble adjusting to life in a nunnery so Mother Abbess sends her to the estate of Capt. Georg von Trapp where she is to be governess to his seven children. The captain has been embittered since his wife died. He runs his home like a ship and treats the children as its crew: giving them uniforms and whistle commands, strictly allowing no laughter, singing or gaiety.<br /><br />The youngsters fight back by annoying every governess Trapp hires into quitting. Their practical jokes don't work on Maria though. Her pleasant manner and a refusal to maintain unbending discipline soon wins them over. When the captain goes off to visit his baroness girlfriend, Maria uses the opportunity to encourage regular playtime and exploration of beautiful Salzburg. She also teaches her charges how to sing and harmonize.<br /><br />Their father comes home and sees his "crew" hanging joyously from trees and romping like the children they are. They all clumsily fall out of a rowboat, precipitating a loud fight between Trapp and Maria in which he orders her to leave. His anger quickly dissipates when the children sing for his guests, the Baroness and Max Detweiler. Their lovely harmonies melt Trapp's frozen heart and the visibly moved captain joins their song. He then asks Maria to stay. Max suggests entering the Trapp Family Singers in the prestigious Salzburg Festival and the captain refuses.<br /><br />At an elegant party hosted by Trapp, Maria realizes she's falling in love with him. She leaves for the convent but Mother Abbess sends her back to the children, who are brokenhearted and have come looking for her. Maria learns of Trapp's engagement to the baroness upon her arrival so she prepares to return to the convent for good...<br /><br />Songs in this classic musical are a delight, Austrian scenery more so, its story's always engaging, but best of all is the nuanced Oscar-nominated performance of Miss Andrews (she'd won the previous year for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304400551">MARY POPPINS</a>).<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.9) The Sound of Music (1965) - Julie Andrews/Christopher Plummer/Eleanor Parker/Richard Haydn/Peggy Wood/Angela Cartwright (uncredited: Maria von Trapp)</p></body></html>

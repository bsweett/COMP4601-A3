YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is both an homage and a comic send-up of the 1931 and 1935 Universal Pictures classics FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (with some SON OF FRANKENSTEIN thrown in for good measure) in which an inspired director (Mel Brooks), an inspired screenwriter (Gene Wilder), and an inspired cast (Wilder as "Dr. Fronkensteen," Teri Garr as his tasty Girl Friday Inga, Marty Feldman as the misshapen hunchbacked lab assistant "Eye-Gore," Cloris Leachman as the cigar-smoking and violin-playing Frau Blucher, Madeleine Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's uptight fiancee Elizabeth, Kenneth Mars as the wooden-armed Inspector Kemp who wears an eyepatch and a monocle on the same side, Gene Hackman as The Lonesome Blind Man, and Peter Boyle as the Monster) create the rarest of synergies onscreen.<br /><br />Professor Frederick Frankenstein's acceptance of his birthright, and his transmutation throughout YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN from a respected American neurosurgeon to the Transylvanian noble, Herr Doktor Baron Frederich von Frankenstein, grave-robber and necromancer nonpareil, is an amusing echo of Colin Clive's ghoulish journey from dedicated Scientist to Mad Doctor, in which the humor of this movie becomes the honorarium paid to the earlier film.<br /><br />YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is as funny today as it was in 1974 when it was released. A staple of the cable channels, it is incredible that a film seen so often can stay so fresh, but YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has everyone involved contributing their finest skills at the peak of their powers. Although classed as a Mel Brooks creation, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN really belongs to Gene Wilder. His script maintains a perfect balance between pure silliness, dry wit, slapstick, and lowbrow humor, each finding it's own place and time within the film's reality---<br /><br />---Igor's directions to "Walk this way" (at which point Wilder adopts his assistant's characteristically hunched and loping stance, staggering toward their nearby horse and wagon. This scene inspired Aerosmith to write their classic rock hit, appropriately entitled, "Walk This Way.")<br /><br />---The screaming of the horses at the mention of Frau Blucher's ("Mrs. Glue"'s) name;<br /><br />---Gene Hackman's kindly but inept blind man's pouring of steaming soup into the Monster's lap and Peter Boyle's reaction ("How hungry you must have been," muses the oblivious Hackman);<br /><br />---"Eye-Gore's" ridiculous attempt at playing Igor to type, as in:<br /><br />Igor---"There wolf. There castle."<br />Dr. Frankenstein---"Why are you talking that way?"<br />Igor---"I thought you wanted to."<br />Dr.---"No, I don't want to."<br />Igor---"Oh, okay. Suit yourself. I'm easy."<br /><br />---Wilder and Boyle's unforgettable white-tie performance of "Puttin' On The Ritz" in front of the Transylvania Neurological Society ("For safety's sake, don't humiliate him!")<br /><br />Endless double entendre ("Elevate me." "Vhat? Here and now?" "Yes. Raise the platform." "Oh! Ze platform, ja, ze platform...").<br /><br />---(And my personal favorite) Cloris Leachman admitting that she set the stage for the creation of the monster, a la:<br /><br />Dr. Frankenstein---"So you and my grandfather...you and he were...?"<br />Frau Blucher (screaming it)---"Yes! Yes! Say it! Say it! He vass my...boyfriend!"<br /><br />Note if you will, the slight question in her tone at the end of her lines, as though asking if this is okay. I always end up howling with laughter at this moment, even though I've seen this picture at least 100 times. The entire film is crafted with moments like this, a jeweled net of pure comic genius.<br /><br />Filmed in atmospheric black and white and borrowing the original lab equipment from James Whale's equally ageless now 77 year old film for dramatic effect, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has unquestionably earned its place both as a classic comedy and as a classic in the monster movie canon on it's own merits. Brooks never topped this film. The closest contender in his oeveur would be BLAZING SADDLES, which, although inspired, relies too heavily on toilet humor to be a true classic. There are few other films made by anyone at any time, which have struck such pure comic notes.<br /><br />In short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN will never grow old.</p></body></html>

If you think that invalidates my opinion of this film and that's going to put you off reading this review, then so long and happy trails, pilgrim.<br /><br />That said, I know of "The X Men" - read some of the comics as a kid, can identify the characters and had soaked up some vague knowledge of "Wolverine's" origins from somewhere. I saw the first "X Men" film at the cinema (yawned and winced my way through it), saw the second one on DVD (yawned and winced my way through that as well) and unintentionally saw the third one on TV over the weekend (and actually quite enjoyed it, the change of director, the increasing moral ambiguity and the increased level of peril to the muties made for a much more enjoyable experience).<br /><br />I initially had no desire to see "Wolverine", but the change in tone of the third film made me think that there might be something in it. So I rented it.<br /><br />My Two Cents?<br /><br />Its good stuff. Let me qualify that. Its good stuff if you're in the mood for a big, dumb, CGI filled Hollywood blockbuster (which was actually filmed in NSW - go skips!) in which lots of things blow up. The fact that it's an origin tale also helped as I'm a sucker for a good origin story.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, by his own admission, wanted to take this one to darker places and he does so with aplomb. He also has the perfect foil in Liev Schrieber's "Sabretooth", who turns out to be the catalyst that ultimately sends him down the road to becoming the man with the cuisinart claws. It has some nice twists in it and some great cameos by other mutants that I vaguely remembered from sunny afternoons spent reading Marvel comics in the back-garden as a child. There's also a deeply amusing riff on the nature of what really happened at "Three Mile Island".<br /><br />That said, I did wince twice (did we really need the glib shot of Wolfboy walking away stone-faced from an exploding helicopter or the obligatory crane shot of him looking up to the sky and yelling "NOOOOOOOOOO!!!" at the heavens? I mean, come on - those were already bad cliches when both the universe AND Dick Clark were young)<br /><br />Will you enjoy it?<br /><br />Well, take the following as a litmus test.<br /><br />I've hated all three of the "Spiderman" films, the first two "X-Men" films and the first "Hulk" movie.<br /><br />However, I really, really enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a> and really enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DHXT2A">The Incredible Hulk (Three-Disc Special Edition)</a> (the one with Ed Norton where, you know, you actually got to see the Hulk smash some stuff up?) and quite enjoyed this film.<br /><br />So my cards are on the table and from them you can make your own call, hombre.</p></body></html>

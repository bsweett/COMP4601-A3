<meta name="summary" content="The best Star Trek movie"></head><body><p>This is far and away the best Star Trek movie.  What I liked best about it is the ultimately very positive and hopeful future that it envisions for humanity.  &quot;Disease and war, within 50 years, they'll all be gone.&quot;  YES!  And the movie ultimately explains how this will come to pass, in an entirely believable way that is consistent with &quot;Star Trek history.&quot;  Too bad they had to throw in another world war first...<p>I thought that the acting by all of the main characters was pretty good--some of their best.  Great direction by Jonathan Frakes.</p></body></html>

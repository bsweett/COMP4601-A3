<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly moving"></head><body><p>Helen Mirren  is one of those amazing actresses that make you forget this is a movie and not the Queen herself.  How she  can keep a 'stiff upper lip' and somehow still convey so much emotion is beyond me.<br /><br />I was surprised at how much emotion this film evoked. "The Queen" is well worth a rental and has earned the top rating for the single viewing; however, I am not planning on adding it to my library.</p></body></html>

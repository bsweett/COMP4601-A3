<meta name="summary" content="A below-average Star Trek Film."></head><body><p>I am still amazed that there are people who will give this a 5-star rating. When first released the movie had one main attraction: The reunion of the original series crew. Being a huge Star Trek fan I went to see it in the theater three times. But even then, before any other ST films were released it was obvious there were problems. Even when you take in the "Director's Cut" that has since been released, updating the look and feel of the movie, it still suffers from one major problem: The story sucked! It ended up being nothing more than a rehash of a couple of shows from the original series.<br /><br />Back in 1979 I listened to a radio interview with Walter Koenig after the movie was released and he basically stated that they started off filming with half a script. Because of the tightness of the shooting schedule there were many times they filmed with only an outline for certain scenes. The film feels that way. There are many scenes that seemed contrived, like the actors were winging it. Some of the acting was horrible (Persis Khambata), some of it was bland (Walter Koenig, George Takei), and some of it was just unecessary (Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney). The best acting on the film was turned in by Stephen Collins (future dad on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDYQ">7th Heaven - Seasons 1-5</a>). His character was interesting. His constant sparring with Admiral Kirk was one of the highlights of the film, giving the picture a great tension within the plot. Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of Spock was OK for this film but lacked originality. At the beginning he's 100% emotionless but by the end of the film he embraces his emotions. This would have been much more interesting had we not seen it 3 - 4 times in the original series.<br /><br />One other problem, there were times that the movie drags. Two scenes in particular: When Scott is taking Kirk over to the Enterprize in a shuttle we're treated to a 10 minute dragging "inspection" of the ship. Interesting for the first 5 minutes, it gets old quickly. But that pales in comparrison to the scene showing the Enterprize entering the Vger cloud. That seemed to go on forever. The only good thing about it, you had enough time to get up, go to the restroom, then stand in line to buy another box of Bon Bons, and still get back before it was over.<br /><br />Are there things to like here? Absolutely! Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack was astounding! No wonder TNG stole it. And, again, the reunion of the cast 10 years after the cancellation of the series was fun to watch. But once you got to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000683DH">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a> you really do realize how bad this movie was. Did they improve it when releasing the "Director's Cut" on DVD? Yes, but only the look and feel of the movie. Even with the extended scenes added, it still ends up towards the bottom of the Star Trek Movie list, just a bit above (maybe) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHOH">Star Trek V - The Final Frontier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>.</p></body></html>

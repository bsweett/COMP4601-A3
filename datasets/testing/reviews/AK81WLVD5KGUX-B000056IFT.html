<meta name="summary" content="One of the great recent SF thrillers"></head><body><p>Paul Verhoeven took it on the chin from fans of Philip K. Dick for this film (just as he did from Heinlein fans for his odd take on _Starship Troopers_).<p>But this nonstop SF action-thriller -- besides being, as its legion of fans will attest, a helluva lot of fun to watch -- is actually a fair translation to the screen of Dick's 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale'. I won't give away any spoilers here, but watch it carefully: are you _sure_ that by the end of the movie you know what's real and what isn't?<p>Readers of Dick's brilliant short story probably wouldn't have cast Arnold in the lead role, either. But all that proves is that we aren't Paul Verhoeven. The movie works.<p>Arnold is in terrific form here as Douglas Quaid, a guy who wants to go to Mars so badly that the subject has become an obsession. He nips off to Rekal, Incorporated, to get a set of false memories implanted, and the rest is SF film history.<p>The special effects are extremely good and the Martian landscape is pretty well realized (although some portions of the 'science' part of the science fiction are decidedly lacking). The supporting cast is magnificent, from Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin to Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox. As we expect from Verhoeven, the dialogue includes quite a bit of profanity and the action includes a lot of gory violence. But if you weren't okay with that, you wouldn't be looking for an Arnold movie, would you?<p>I have the Special Limited Edition (the one with the Mars-shaped metal box). The 'special' features are nice; Schwarzenegger and Verhoeven provide some good commentary and the 'making-of' documentary is worth watching once.<p>But the real star is the movie itself, which (despite some cliches) manages to stay fresh after numerous repeated viewings. Pop it in and crank it up.</p></body></html>

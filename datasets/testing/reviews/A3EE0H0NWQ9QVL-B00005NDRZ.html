Having seen the snippets of Jack Nicholson's skillful performance, I partly dismissed the movie.  In my mind, thinking of his famous line, "Here's Johnny!" the film seemed a novelty, something entertaining in a way it wasn't intended.  Between Stanley Kubrick's amazing direction and Nicholson's and Shelly Duvall's excellent performances, first impressions can be misleading.  Watching `The Shining' is a real treat.<br /><br />Most people are familiar with either the film or the Stephen King book or both, so I'll be brief about the plot:  Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a former Vermont school teacher, transitioning as a novelist.  He interviews as a hotel keeper during the off season in Colorado's high country with the prospect of bringing his family to the empty domain.  During the interview, his new employer delicately lets him know about a tragedy at the hotel several years ago:  A former caretaker became unhinged by cabin fever and had slain his entire family with an axe.  Unfazed by the history, Jack signs on the dotted.  At home his son Danny has rough times.  A visionary of sorts, his other personality picks up on future ominous events, making the boy dread their new venture.  At the hotel, they meet the head chef, Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who picks up on little Danny's perception with an ESP type awareness.<br /><br />Both the story and Kubrick's masterful direction make 'The Shining' a horror classic.  From the start we get vertiginous mountain views and all of the visions seep into our unconscious core, making the deep winter mountain adventure chilling indeed.  Seldom have I seen such an effect of going around the bend.  Whether from the point of view of boy on a Big Wheel ? or in an outdoor labyrinthine evergreen maze, the suspense of danger around every corner is palpable.  Foreshadowing is amply present, constantly building up every scene to each chosen climax.<br /><br />While nearly a flawless horror movie, there are a few objections.  Jack makes some connections to the horrible past in ways that are meant to be authentic, but break some of the mood of the movie.  While the time frames are well connected between present and past, the execution leaves something to be desired as Jack finds a key player in the past.<br /><br />Despite this minor objection, `The Shining' is a thriller.  The aftermath of my latent viewing is awe for Nicholson's creepy performance as the slowly transforming Jack, and Duvall's portrayal of growing terror is unnerving and frames Nicholson's performance perfectly.  Like Linda Blair before him, Danny Lloyd is perfectly believable as the little boy.  Happy Halloween! -JP |:>[</p></body></html>

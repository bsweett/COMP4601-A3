<meta name="summary" content="Story - NOT Special Effects - Make This Story Scary"></head><body><p>With the onset of big special-effect production houses like &quot;Industrial Light &amp; Magic,&quot; and &quot;Dreamworks&quot; there have been few movies in this genre of macabre horror that haven't capatilized on using visual imagery to achieve scares.  Monsters are more foul, more hideous than ever, and with the use of computers, almost anything can be created.  And yet, in a twist of irony, it is these very same effect houses that have diminished our ability to be scared by de-sensitizing us to the macabre by making it so readily available.<p>This is why some of the more inventive directors in Hollywood are again turning to more traditional means of filmmaking, focusing on camera effect, light and shadow, and most importantly, story-telling, to achieve bigger screams and better thrills.  &quot;The Others&quot; is a prime example of such a film.<p>Set in the long halls, and lofty rooms of an old English manor, the story tells of a woman and her ill children, living alone and abandoned on an island in the throws of a world war.  The woman, played brilliantly by Nicole Kidman, is met by a trio of housekeepers who arrive unexpectedly at her doorstep.  She invites them in and hires them immediately, explaining the house has been left in disarray since the last set of servants disappeared very unexpectedly.<p>It isn't long before the story really starts to build momentum.  The children, who suffer from an illness that makes sunlight lethal to them, move about the house in darkness, each room's windows carefully covered to avoid exposure.  Relationships begin to develop between the family and the servants, and as they do, so too does the house begin to fill with the sound of the &quot;others&quot; who seem to have taken residence.  <p>The story is very simple, almost linear in its development, but its strong focus on developing its characters a layer at a time provide more scares, more edge-of-your-seat than any effect could.  Ironically, there are no obvious special-effects in this film.  It is the masterful use of light and shadow, odd camera angles, and a beautifully written soundtrack that make this film both frightening and genuinely interesting to watch, right up to the suprise ending in the final minutes of the film.</p></body></html>

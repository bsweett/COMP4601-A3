The reverse track, the  heavy use(and expert use) of the steadicam, the slow pull backs and slow  zoom ins are all Kubrick. One of the best scenes is when a squad of war  correspondents are scene panning past a unit of Marines after an  attack(with The Trashmen playing in the background), and each Marine gives  his contribution to Sgt. Cowboy's &quot;Start the cameras, this is  Vietnam--The movie! &quot;.  Boot camp scenes are powerful and there  is one scene that is priceless as the D.I. is lecturing to the young boots  about 2 of the world's greatest sharpshooters Charles Whitman and Lee  Harvey Oswald!As we are taken to Hue City during the '68 Tet Offensive, we  get to see what happened to some of the recruits that made it out of boot  camp(now of higher rank-Sgt.Joker,for ex.). Good Vietnam war flick that  shows the young audiences that the war was not just fought out in the  jungles, but in the cities as well.My only complaint(and it is a technical  one) is when are they going to re-release this in DOLBY-SURROUND?</p></body></html>

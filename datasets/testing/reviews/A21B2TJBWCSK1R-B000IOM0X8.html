He somehow let his guard down (reportedly promised that the film would be a faithful adaptation of his book) and allowed Hollywood to adapt Sahara into a big budget action/adventure film starring Matthew McConaughey as Pitt in 2005.<br /><br />Sahara trots out the usual archetypes: Pitt is the dashing hero; Al is his comic relief sidekick with the Eva as the plucky love interest. The chemistry between McConaughy and Zahn is good and feels authentic. They play well off each other even if their characters never transcend their stereotypes. McConaughy proves to be a credible action hero firmly in the Indiana Jones tradition while Zahn is spot-on with his comic timing and is as watchable as ever. Alas, there is zero chemistry between McConaughy and Cruz who looks lost in this movie. To her credit, she has little to work with.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Breck Eisner. Lines like, "our methodology for shooting this scene..." are typical of this technically-oriented track. Eisner comes off as a little dry but his comments are worth a listen if you want the nitty gritty details of how this film was put together.<br /><br />Also included is another commentary with Eisner and actor/executive producer Matthew McConaughy. There is a nice, conversational tone to this track as the two men tell many anecdotes of filming.<br /><br />"Across the Sands of Sahara" is a featurette on the long journey to get this movie made.<br /><br />"Visualizing Sahara" examines how every scene was extensively storyboarded but was sometimes changed once on location or when someone would come up with a good idea. The look of the film, like costumes and visual effects, are explored in this featurette.<br /><br />"Cast and Crew Wrap Film" is a montage that establishes the scale of the production: hundreds of crew members, all kinds of vehicles and several exotic locales. It's a quick snapshot of how tough this shoot must have been but also the fun that these people had making the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Eisner and McConaughy. Most significantly, is a second historical opening that sets up the plane that Pitt and Al find later on.</p></body></html>

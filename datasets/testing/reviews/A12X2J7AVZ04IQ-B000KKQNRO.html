Indeed, "Gone With the Wind" was bought and put into production almost immediately after its publication in 1937. That was a tough book to film, and came out fine. Dan Brown's "The DaVinci Code" must've also been tough to film, if only for the protests that surrounded it. I applaud anyone who comes up with a new idea regarding anything. Certainly, filmmakers have been fascinated with such conundrums as the origin of the universe, life on other planets, the end of the world, re-structuring other cultures, etc. That Ron Howard had the courage to tackle this controversial book, with an equally courageous screenplay treatment by Akiva Goldsman, is NOT to be dismissed. It is merely an interpretation of an alternative idea, including the hate-mongers who will suppress those ideas. I give Mr. Howard & Mr. Goldsman credit for this creative effort. The plot has a few holes, and certainly will offend "by-the-book" Christians, but, as filmmaking, it succeeds quite well. The film itself is very talky, requires concentration, and has a lot of slow moments that will annoy the average American filmgoer. At 149 minutes, it tells a tale that is far-fetched at first then grabs our attention, mostly because of the excellent acting from all involved. Indeed, Ian McKellan may finally receive a long overdue Oscar, if the Academy can remember that far back. Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina, Jurgen Prochnow...this is A-List casting, and none disappointed. I was also impressed with the editing, which kept the film taut and interesting at all times, allowing the slow moments to prepare the viewer for the excitement that follows. The DVD 2nd disc is rife with interesting stuff.  You don't have to believe the premise. All you have to do is kick back and absorb a fine, exciting narrative that will not fail to entertain.</p></body></html>

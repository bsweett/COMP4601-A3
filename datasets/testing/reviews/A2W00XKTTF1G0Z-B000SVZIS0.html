<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton Has Done Much Better efore."></head><body><p>PLANET OF THE APES is a good DVD to have. Just for the extra features. However, the movie leaves a little to be desired overall. Mark Walhberg has done much better acting before. The most outstanding performance is Helena Boham Carter, David Warner and Tim Roth. They are some of the best apes I have ever scene. Even behind 3 pounds of facial make-up - they are wonderful.<p>This movie does tribute to the original, but the original was much more entertaining for me. I am not a big Charlton Heston fan, but I must admit he did far better in the original. The story even has a twist I didn't like. The ending was changed. The original has a much more powerful revealing ending.<p>Basically it is the same story, but the action and story focuses on the changing of history and alternate time-lines. They borrowed all of these concepts from Star Trek. There was a lot of originality here except a few performances.<p>The DVD extras are the best I have seems which made this movie redeem itself on DVD. It has a lot of behind the scenes documentaries from teaching the extras how to be apes to costuming, sets, wardrobe and the detailing of the new make-up  technologies that we have. The details and interviews and interviews are detailed and very interesting. There are music videos and a script-to-screen comparison for those script fans.<p>The movie itself could have been better - but the DVD has a lot of DVD extras that make it worth while.

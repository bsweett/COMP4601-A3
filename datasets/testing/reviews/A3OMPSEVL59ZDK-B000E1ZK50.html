<meta name="summary" content="I am your average movie goer- I love garbage"></head><body><p>Any review that tells that you must love this film BECAUSE its absolutely stupid garbage is a joke. This movie is a joke. A very unfunny two hour joke. The cast, the acting, the action, the script, the direction, the special effects. Its 200 million dollars thrown down the toilet. This is not camp. Camp is intentional. This is a complete mess. A ship worthy of going down with the Titanic. A waste of Hugh Jackmans talent and time. If you must lower your IQ to enjoy a film, that is a sad state of affairs. This is why hollywood continues to give us garbage because there are those that eat it and call it candy. <p>But hey you must love it...because its stupid and terrible. But thats why its good, right?<p>(...)</p></body></html>

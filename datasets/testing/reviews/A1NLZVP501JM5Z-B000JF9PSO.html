<meta name="summary" content="To Never Forget"></head><body><p>That is what we must do, never forget the people that died on September 11, and movies like United 93 help us to remember those who died.  Everything about that day is reccounted slowly and in great detail.  We meet the passengers, the flight operators, and the hijackers.  We see the first reports, the towers being hit, and United 93 going down in a cornfield in Pennsylvania.  It is very emotional and disturbing.<br /><br />The film ends on a black screen, dedicated to those who endured 9/11.  This film is very well made and Paul Greengrass was the perfect choice to direct this movie.  The actors are all unknown, but they all do a good job.  Early in the movie a man almost misses the plane, but just gets there in time, and you know that hes going to die.<br /><br />Overall this is a well-made film and is emotional hard to watch, but you have to, have to never forget.</p></body></html>

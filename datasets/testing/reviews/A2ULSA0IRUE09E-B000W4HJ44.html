<meta name="summary" content="Weak Casting + Great Music = An Average Film"></head><body><p>Hmmmm, so many positive reviews for this film and yet it left me rather underwhelmed. I hated last years' "Dreamgirls" and especially despised Jennifer Hudson's hideously over-the-top performance, so it was no surprise that I found this weak as well.<br /><br />Primary concern is with the uninspired casting. Where the 1988 film had charm and wit, this one is one big drag joke. Not for one instant can you take John Travolta seriously as a woman, not even in a campy way, and since so much screen time is devoted to him, its a bit sad to see the film lower its' standards each time it cuts to Travolta's idiotic performance.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky has been getting so much good press, but its hard to see why. At best she is an overweight girl who has an average singing voice. There is nothing special about her at all. She lacks that *it* factor that can grab your attention - and lets face it, if watching an overweight high school student with a weak voice running around the streets of Baltimore is your kind of thing, you'll like this. It isn't my bag at all, and I hated it. No one should offer this woman any more roles in the future - she is a total waste of screen.<br /><br />The good? Well you have James Marsden (Cyclops from 'X-Men') in perhaps his best role. He doesn't have a very big role, but he is a fine actor and dancer, and has the screen charisma to set the frames ablaze everytime the machines focus on his face. And what can one say about Zac Efron? I fail to understand his appeal. I've said it before - he is supposed to be 19 years old but looks like a fifty year old woman post cosmetic surgery. This is no joke. How any thirteen year old girl can find someone like him 'hot' is beyond me. When I was a teen, I remember girls around me idolizing Jordan Knight, NKOTB, and Tommy Page, but at least they all looked remotely like men, or boys to say the least. Yuck.<br /><br />The musical score is great, but then again, I would recommend the soundtrack if you liked the music alone. I find that listening to the CD (I have the entire soundtrack on my Ipod) is a much more rewarding experience.<br /><br />Here is an example - I had the soundtrack for a full two months before I saw the actual film. Imagine my disgust when the opening track, "Good Morning Baltimore" burst onto the screen with a plain-jane Nikki Blonsky fatly jumping pavements in what can only be termed an uninspired miasma of cliched film-hell? Disgusting. I'll stick to my soundtrack, thank you. It was quite a task watching these beautiful numbers done so poorly on screen.<br /><br />I have to give kudos to the only two people here who actually shone - Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah. Now these are two women who deserve to lend their talents to better films - I agree - but over here they had a few good songs and their segments seem infinitely more superior to the madness that are the other scenes. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if they chopped out the ludicrous John Travolta scenese and re-released this, I just might want to watch it again. They should also cut out Blonsky while they're at it. Or just remake the whole thing again. But I digress.<br /><br />Bottom Line - This was a huge disappointment for me, a lover of the soundtrack. When the best thing about a film is the guy who played Cyclops from X-Men, then you know you aren't faring very well. Better luck with the next musical adaptation boys. And please don't cast Travolt a or Blonsky in that one and mess it up.</p></body></html>

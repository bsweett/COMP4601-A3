<meta name="summary" content="Good Concept, Decent Production"></head><body><p>This is a decent movie. It is not too bad in that the story is compelling and it is shot in a decent manner, but this movie is somewhat poor in its timing and special effects. It just gets a slow at times and the special affects are somewhat corny. I mean the story just needed a little more editing to make the thing so good you could not turn away. However, as the movie was offered as a final product it is very slow at points. The acting was very good, and the movie made a point. It just was a little slow. Worth a watch, but not buying.</p></body></html>

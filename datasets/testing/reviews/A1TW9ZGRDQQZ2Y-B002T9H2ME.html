<meta name="summary" content="A journey to The Dark Side of the Moon"></head><body><p>I've heard nothing but great things about Moon from both critics and us regular movie watching folks, so I'm happy to say that the hype did not let me down.<br /><br />The movie starts off slow, but then the mystery element kicks in and keeps this baby moving right along. It plays out like an extended Twilight Zone episode, but in this case, it's like one of the great episodes. There are also a lot of similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The main twist is revealed earlier on than I expected, but I liked the way it was handeled. You think you have it figured out, then it goes in a surprisingly new direction. I have to admit that it caught me off guard.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is very convincing here in a role that requires him to just talk to a robot, voiced by Kevin Spacey, or to himself. Since he is the only actor we see for 95 minutes, his role demands someone of his talents and he deserved an Oscar nomination, as did the movie itself. Why broaden the Best Picture category to 10 films this year and put The Blind Side in over Moon?<br /><br />I recommend not knowing anything about Moon before watching it. I didn't even bother to read the description of the movie before viewing the rental last night. If you must, Amazon gives a brief explanation of the the plot without revealing too much. In any case, this is a low budget Sci-Fi gem that is getting the respect it deserves.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

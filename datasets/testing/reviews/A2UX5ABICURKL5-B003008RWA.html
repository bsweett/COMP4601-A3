<meta name="summary" content="Ok Boys & Girls I watched it!!"></head><body><p>I must say it's not as bad as I thought it might be, now that doesn't mean I agree with everything Michael does, but I would say he's done his homework.<br />Yes, I think "WE THE PEOPLE" need to get more into this issue,<br />and let the government know "we not me" we mean business.<br />I'm still a little iffy on Universal health care, I'm going to start reading more about it so I can understand it better.<br />Let me tell you this that there's not many times that I change my mind,<br />but this time I actually did.<br />Mike seemed charismatic about helping people and not just his bank account!!<br />Well any way before I say too much, I Truly recomend watching this documentary.<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

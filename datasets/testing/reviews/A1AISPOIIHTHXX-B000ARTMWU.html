You probably know it's going to be terrible because of word of mouth or reviews but you just try anyway, in hopes that it could pull a rabbit out and surprise you. After being uber-disappointed in the Saw sequels, the Hills Have Eyes remake and the too-awful-for-words tragedy that is Hostel, I know now how recent horror movies are so if it sucks, I've no one to blame but myself. Before he made the Hills Have Eyes remake, Alexandre Aja made this with more than a couple ideas from other films but it ultimately doesn't lead to a satisfying whole, just bit parts.<br /><br />Marie and Alex are 2 friends driving to the countryside to stay at Alex's old house with her parents and brother. Things are fine until a truck driver pulls up to the house and brutally kills everyone, stalks the rooms looking for Marie and tying up Alex. Marie decides to save the day and help her friend but the killer isn't some run-of-the-mill moron either.<br /><br />Now, unlike the film's I mentioned where they seemed like endurance tests and how long would it take before I switched the movie off, I had to admit this film did have me for awhile. The first section of it, taking place in the house is creepy with plenty of atmosphere, heightened sound effects and a foreboding feel in the air. Sure there's some gore but it was excusable since they didn't go full tilt with it. But then goes nuts and has some gore, including a big act involving a circular saw and it just feels too much. Whereas before it was more of a thriller/horror, here they overdo it and it becomes just another slasher movie.<br /><br />Now it comes down to the "twist" which I won't reveal but it feels slightly gimmicky like they saw the Usual Suspects, Memento, the Sixth Sense and Fight Club in a row and thought twist endings were cool so they wrote one of their own. It would be fine if the twist fit but instead it brings just an out of the blue shift that it just doesn't feel right. Then there's the writing where you can notice clues along the way. Some twists work because it's only on second viewing you notice whereas here certain things just look too obvious. Example? A hand carrying bullets. I'll say no more.<br /><br />If you like Hostel, Hills Have Eyes or Wolf Creek, you'll like this too. If you prefer the Shining or the Exorcist, you might want to look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

My mother, 13 year old daughter, 5 year old daughter and I all loved every minute of it.  TOY STORY 3 made all three generations of my family laugh, cry, and cheer.  Yes, the story is basically the same story told in the other two movies - the toys have to get back to Andy - but we certainly didn't care.  Disney has pulled off a perfect hat trick, a golden triple crown with the Toy Story trio, and they are all endearing family movies.  And it is possible that TOY STORY 3 is the best of them all.<br /><br />TOY STORY 3 is clearly meant to be the end of the Toy Story saga:  Andy is going off to college (really?  It seems that just yesterday he was 6 years old and getting a Buzz Lightyear doll...where does the time go???).  Andy must decide what to do with his favorite toys; he hasn't played with them in years, but they are still his favorites and have sentimental value.  What should he do with them?  Through an unfortunate but completely plausible mistake, the toys end up donated to a preschool.  Although most of the toys believe Andy sent them there on purpose, Woody is ever loyal, and knows that this is not the case.  He finally convinces the others of their error, and now, of course, the toys must get back to Andy before he leaves for college.  Will they ever get home?  Will they get there safely?  Will they make it before Andy leaves?  What will become of them?<br /><br />TOY STORY 3 is delightful entertainment for the entire family.  Disney does many things right, but their stories with the message of being true to yourself and true to your friends are always outstanding.  These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many forms.  And TOY STORY 3 is one of their best.<br /><br />With outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike will are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim.  The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect.  Added to that are some wonderful gags that will leave you laughing until you cry.  Look for guest appearances from many toys from your childhood; they will bring back many happy memories and lots of giggles.  Especially endearing was the return of Barbie, who at long last met her Ken.  Their interaction, as well as Barbie's stunning declaration that "Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force!" (she really has brains under all that blond hair!), is hysterical and memorable.<br /><br />Take lots of tissues to TOY STORY 3, especially if you have a child who has left for college.  Andy makes a beautiful decision in the end, and clearly, all the toys we have come to love will live happily ever after.  Well done, Disney.  The entire TOY STORY trilogy is a true classic, one that will be loved by generations to come.</p></body></html>

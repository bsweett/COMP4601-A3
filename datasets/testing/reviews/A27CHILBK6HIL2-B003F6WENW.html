<meta name="summary" content="A Comedy Much Needed In The Midst Of A Dull Summer Movie Season"></head><body><p>MOVIE: A slight breath of fresh air hits the theaters in the midst of this dull summer in the form of Wedding Crashers.  Basically the title says it all, we have to guys who go to weddings to pick up girls, but at one point Owen Wilson's character has enough and figures that this is childish.  He then falls for a woman who is the daughter of a famous U.S Senator played by Christopher Walken.  Now Owen Wilson is willing to go to the extremes to lie about who he is so that he can try and win over this girl.  He drags Vince Vaughn along for the ride who has been caught by the eye of the senator's other daughter.  The whole movie basically takes place at the senator's summer home by the Chesapeake Bay.  Here ensues some hilarious situations with the great comic talents of the leading actors.  By far the funniest scene in the movie is the dinner scene, which I won't describe because it needs to be seen fresh.  Another funny scene is where Vince Vaughn is tied up by the girl who has fallen for him, she then forces him into sex while he is tied up.  Later the sentor's homosexual son finds him in this vulnerable position and things go from there.  The movie is funny, but unfortunetly relies on physical comedy to keep it moving.  The characters are one dimensiona, and the plot is a cliche of every other romance movie.  The guy who wants the girl, but the girl is with another man, the man is an ass, in the end the guy gets the girl and the ass gets the boot.  It's a very formulaic movie, but it's funny.  Not the funniest movie I have ever seen, but it's funny.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting we get is all physical.  Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are hilarious in the movie, but the characters they play are not developed well enough in the script for us to care what happens to them.  The audience is just along for the ride.  Christopher Walken plays another funny role, not as funny as other stuff he has done but still funny.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie is a great summer comedy with all the right ingredients for a croud pleaser.  At this point it doesn't matter what anybody says about it, because New Line Cinema is up to their ears in money from this one.  It's a road map plot with one dimensional characters, but it is very funny and has a hilarious cameo at the end.</p></body></html>

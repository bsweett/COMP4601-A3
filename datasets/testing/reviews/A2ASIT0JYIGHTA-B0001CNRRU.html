Going backwards and forwards in time has been done so much better in other films.  It really wasn't necessary for this film, and in a waty detracted from the performances.<p>21 Grams has been acclaimed as Naomi and Sean's shining moments.  Let me say that Sean Penn is excellent, but Naomi didn't deliver the extraordinary performance that I was expecting (based on her Oscar nomination).  On top of that her character lost credibility.  One minute she says that &quot;nothing will bring them back&quot;, then in a future scene she wishes to kill the man who did it.<p>21 Grams is a watchable piece of film, but could have been so much more  ... a better script, for starters would have helped.</p></body></html>

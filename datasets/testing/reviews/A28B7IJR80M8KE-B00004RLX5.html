<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Star Trek&quot; at its best!!"></head><body><p>Although this one was a crowd pleaser, it is definately different than its predesesors, picking up where Star Trek III left off, we see Kirk &amp; Co. getting ready to leave Vulcan for earth in the Klingon Bird Of Prey that they have to shuttle home because of the Enterprise's destruction in &quot;III&quot;, knowing that they face court-martial from the events of &quot;III&quot; they leave only to discover that a probe is interupting earth's atmosphere, &amp; is on the verge of destruction, Spock now recovering fom his experience from the prior installments, discovers that the probe is trying desperately to communicate with the now extinct humpback whales, in order to stop its destruction, they have to time-travel to earth's past &amp; retrieve some humpbacks, this is where the fun starts as we see Kirk &amp; Co. trying to blend in with modern present day-to-day life, that is far more interesting then what they have encountered before, Kirk &amp; Spock get the whales while McCoy &amp; Scotty try to get a glass compartment for their journey back, with Uhura &amp; Checkov getting nuclear power for the Bird Of Prey's prime reactor that was drained during the trip back, they get it from the real U.S.S. Enterprise, while Sulu rents a chopper for transporting the plexy glass, Kirk now has to persuade Dr. Gillian (Catherine Hicks), a marine biologist, to give him their location as they are to be moved from an institute to the open sea, definately a fun movie that has Spock re-citing logic in an illogical enviroment, &amp; Kirk &amp; Co. saving earth's future as well as their own, Leonard Nimoy who directed &quot;III&quot; does it again with &quot;IV&quot;, &amp; pulls it off nicely here.</p></body></html>

It is a classic, and deservedly so.  Only Kubrick could have given us this screwball, slapstick, intelligent dark comedy about the end of the world.<p>Each frame is a memorable moment.  Each line is a classic.  Every actor puts in a career performance.  This bizarre  jewel is one of the best films ever made. Wacky fun, yet sharp and poignant.<p>This Special Edition DVD is a good set.  One disk only, aside from the director-approved cut of the film there are a couple of documentaries, a split-screen Peter Sellers/George C. Scott interview and the award-winning add campaign for the movie.<p>The documentaries are interesting.  They include interviews with friends and colleagues of Kubrick, as well as interviews with several people who worked on "Dr. Strangelove."  There is obvious care that went into putting together this DVD.</p></body></html>

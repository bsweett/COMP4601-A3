<meta name="summary" content="[3.5]--Good Film but something smells a bit off"></head><body><p>There is such a fascination in adapting famous books to the cinema language, for both filmmakers and film-viewers, especially if the book is a famous best seller one. Comparisons will take place, no doubt. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is almost a collective part of a lot of people's memory and wakes curiosity the film itself. So I clearly see that the cinema language is absolutely different than literature language (in all genres)? Anyhow, expectations are served. Jean-Baptiste is someone special since he is born, in the middle of a fish market, where the smelling was everywhere except in him. As he grows, the scents and smelling becomes his path for pleasure, for recognizing, for commitments. In his memories he keeps all kind of scents, even without knowing where they come from, and he tries to bring them back to reality, as perfumes. When he achieves it, he attempts to create his best perfume, moral apart, regardless of the way he does it. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer," is a great manufactured film, no doubt, great scenarios, great cinematography, create custom design. The film, although basically a German production, was filmed in English, not being the first time (perhaps for an international appeal?),<br /><br /> I didn't actually mention 'good editing' among the virtues of "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer."  Some of the most exciting moments of the film, are when some scents call the attention of some characters (the plum girl, Baldini, Dominique, the orgy, etc), and the way the film 'tries' to show us the effect on them is with fast and short cuts, 'a-la-Hollywood', which I am not saying is bad, but it is just too rapid in the visual way, and not as subtle as a scent actually would work. A resource which is over-used lately in a lot of films is the close-up. And I guess that happens when a director finds kind of non-easy to portray a character, so, let us see at least a close-up of the actor. Again, lack of subtlety. So, I wouldn't even praise the achievement in make up in this film, only for showing us closely the noses and faces of some actors. I am not the greatest fan of Tom Tykwer, yet I think he's a good director, but as a stage-director, he may lose some control on his actors, that lead us to see Alan Rickman as a flat character and Dustin Hoffman seem miscast and a bit over the top, even as a silly perfumer, Ben Whishaw is fantastic for creating and developing his own Jean-Baptiste (watch his tics) and it's hard to avoid to see him a bit overacted in some scenes. Jessica Schwartz in her short role is great; she has what is called presence. And the orgy's scene made me laugh for moments; I would rather have felt embarrassed. Another resource which is sometimes unnecessarily used is the voice-off. I am not disappointed with "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer." I was entertained, I enjoyed the experience, but I have to be honest by saying the typical phrase "it could've been better...". And more expectations are served.</p></body></html>

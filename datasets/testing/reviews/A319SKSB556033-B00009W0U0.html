<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely MENTAL!!!"></head><body><p>Gulp! This was one barmy film. By far the most true, nerve-wracking horror we've had in ages. Far too many 'horror' movies over the past 10 years have been neutralized sub-genre flicks starring generic babes and hunks from teen soaps. Nothing of the sort here. Rob Zombie has made a REAL horror film with some shocking and unbelievable elements.<p>Four kids, on their way home, stop over at some remote gas station (and fried chicken bar) run by the manic Captain Spaulding. Upon witnessing his freak-show amusement ride of urban legends they become fascinated with the myth of Doctor Satan, an insane local mass-murder/torturer/scientist. They make the very unwise decision of taking a slight detour in order to find him. <p>Soon enough they've picked up a wild hitchhiker called Baby who is more than a little slutty. Their car blows a tire and Baby has her brother Otis take them back to her house for repairs. Baby, Otis and the rest of the family seem kind of hospitable at first, despite their peculiar idiosyncrasies. <p>After that, well...complete and utter madness follows. Rob Zombie bombards us with so much horror, both macabre and morbid, that the film becomes a hypnotic thrill ride of guts, gore and grim. As the traumatized teens slowly lose their minds so do we. They barely have time to comprehend the mania and carnage and neither does the audience.<p>In the final 15 minutes our senses are so over-stimulated by the breath-taking madness, furious pace, escalating and mind-blowing horror that the shocking plot twist in the last few seconds comes as the biggest surprise and fright I've ever seen in a movie. <p>Many have criticized Zombie's Oliver Stone-type direction of this film and called his rapid switching of film-stocks jarring and distracting. I didn't mind it at all. It adds to the unstable atmosphere of the film and only proves Zombie took more time and effort to put this film together than most other directors do. <p>House of 1000 Corpses was made by Universal and Zombie wrapped production way back in Spring 2000. But the film was so gory and perverse that Universal simply refused to release it. MGM tried to help get it out there but ended up dumping it too. Finally Lion's Gate Films stepped in and gave the film a limited run (which is unfortunate since a mainstream Universal release would have guaranteed it reached a bigger audience). By this point the film had been cut, edited and censored. Which is a big shame. Even with these 15 minutes missing House of 1000 Corpses will still leave you feeling numb and slightly sick.<p>As Zombie is already working on a sequel (called The Devil's Rejects) he doesn't have the time to work on the uncut DVD but has promised he will do his best to get it out there. So until then get your fix with this DVD. <p>The film is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Special features include a commentary, a featurette, audition footage, rehearsal footage, cast and crew interviews, a still gallery, trailers and an isolated score.</p></body></html>

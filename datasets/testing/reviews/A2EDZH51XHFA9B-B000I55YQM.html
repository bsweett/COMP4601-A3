If youhaven't seen the original, stop now and go rent it.<br /><br />Taking on a remake of one of the finest films ever created takes stones. Jonathan Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne (The Sum of All Fears) and Dean Georgaris (Paycheck) decided to do something exceptionally risky; not only sis they update the script for The Manchurian Candidate to the present day, they also wrote a "based-on" screenplay that would twist things so that those who have seen the amazing original would still not know what was coming. It was, to say the least, an admirable idea, and had it worked, this new version of The Manchurian Candidate may well have stood with the original as a piece of American film history. Unfortunately, the practice didn't quite gel with the theory.<br /><br />Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) led a troop of men in Kuwait just before Desert Storm. The men, now known as the Lost Platoon, were ambushed, and Marco was knocked unconscious, leading the way for Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), after taking out the enemy, to lead the troop back to civilization for three grueling days across the desert. In the time since, Marco has stayed a career Marine, while Shaw has gone onto a career in politics, driven by his obsessed mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep). Thanks to Eleanor's machinations, Raymond snatches the vice-presidential candidacy out from under the nose of Tom Jordan (Jon Voight), with whose daughter Jocelyn (Vera Farmiga of the TV series Touching Evil) Shaw had been involved before joining the armed forces. Or, at least, that's how everyone remembers it. Marco is approached by one of the Lost Troop, Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright of Basquiat fame), who's been having disturbing dreams about those three days. Marco's been having the dreams, too, and he undertakes a quest to figure out what really happened to them during those three days in the desert.<br /><br />The Manchurian Candidate may be a remake, but it's informed by a number of things that have come between (most notably Jacob's Ladder), and so the updating-to-the-present-time part of the screenplay works better than one would expect it to. The new plot twists also work on a number of levels. Where the film fails is in its attempts to bring the original screenplay into the mix. A number of scenes (especially the garden party) and characters (most notably Jocelyn) seem as if they've been left in for the purpose of pacifying fans of the original film, and serve no real purpose in the remake. What actually happened in the desert is presented here in far more impressionist fashion than what happened to Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey in China in the original, and the whole things ends up being confusing, rather than illuminating. (Kudos to the screenwriters for keeping the title relevant while changing the setting, even if they did take something of an easy way out). The film's other stumbling block is that one of the new twists gives portions of the climax an overly moralizing tone that really wasn't necessary.<br /><br />All that said, the usual suspects turn in some amazing performances. The infamous kiss shared between Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury in the original film is played with even more understatement here by Streep and Schreiber, and it's just as shocking in 2004 as it was in 1962, though more open to interpretation. Some time in this (or any) review of the film should be given to the performance of Liev  Schreiber, who has quietly amassed a resume of excellent performances under the Hollywood radar, and blossoms here, albeit as a supporting actor. (Washington's Marco has morphed into the film's main character, whereas Frank Sinatra played the supporting role to Laurence Harvey in the original, despite Sinatra and Harvey having roughly the same relative status in Hollywood in 1962 as Washington and Schreiber have today.) If anything good comes from this film, it will hopefully be Schreiber seeing more lead roles.<br /><br />An interesting flick, but one that pales in comparison to the original. ** ?</p></body></html>

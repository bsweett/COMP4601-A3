I recently saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E75QGG">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>, and the green screen special effects were so obvious that it was distracting to the action. That kind of blatant "fakeness" would not be good in a movie like The Hulk whose 'big' star is CGI technology. No. The Hulk delivers a realistic looking CGI protagonist (and a cool looking antagonist).<br /><br />The story flow is a little slow at times, and I'm not sure that Ed Norton was a slam-dunk Bruce Banner. The movie was good while Ed and his supporting cast were on-screen, but the movie was great when his CGI counterpart smashed onto the screen.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk takes you from a brief introduction of how Bruce Banner became The Hulk, who uncontrollably destroyed everything in his path, to perhaps the first real confrontation that earned The Hulk superhero status. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. I was thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />The story is well-written for the screen by X-men screenwriter Zak Penn. The really good news is that Penn has announced that he is working on the screenplay that will bring The Hulk, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAPC1K">Iron Man</a> and the rest of The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828">Avengers</a> together on the big screen perhaps as early as 2010 (wishful thinking).<br /><br />The Hulk needs some friends to help move his movies along when he's not in the green. The Avengers movie would be just the antidote that he's looking for.</p></body></html>

With her powerhouse performance, Jodie Foster shows exactly what many gun owners experience to some degree; at film's end we are left wondering whether we should own a gun also.<br /><br />Foster plays Erica Bain, a New York City DJ who ruminates late at night about her beloved city. She's one of those sexy voices many people find themselves addicted to hearing on a regular basis, and is an excellent cure for the loneliness only a big city can create. In a brutal, sadistic attack in Central Park, Erica loses her fianc&eacute; David Kirmani (a very sexy Naveen Andrews). After awakening from a coma in the hospital, Erica suffers the natural meltdown upon learning of the murder.<br /><br />This rather precipitate storyline interested me in one singular point: once Erica seeks to buy a gun and receive instruction, she panics and yells that she must have a gun immediately or she "will die". That reaction in the face of a normal gun acquisition struck me as the loud indicator that Erica is somewhat out of her mind. She skips the formalities and buys a gun 'out of the trunk of a car', as we say.<br /><br />The scene with the trafficker giving her rapid lessons in a back alley is heartrending. Soon Erica is making her way around NYC, blasting away at all deserving bad guys. If you recall the tragic case of Bernard Goetz in the NYC subway decades ago, you'll understand her. Eventually she entices criminals only to shoot them down, but the first time she is forced to use her gun - in a store robbery - her horrible agitation and the adrenalin makes the scene that much more horrific and memorable.<br /><br />She is watched over, helped a bit, by a police officer (the wonderful Terence Howard as Detective Mercer). He seems to be the left-wing anti-gun voice in the film, yet he, too eventually gives way to the need for citizens to be armed. In an ending I will not divulge, the audience learns all about guns, whether we want to or not.<br /><br />As a gun advocate and one-time owner, which always shocks everyone, I loved this film for its unblinking approach to one person's need for a gun. Foster becomes like a junkie, spraying bullets quite expertly at the bad guys and glaring with maniacal glee once the job's done. She's protecting her city and its citizens. The fear of public retribution is probably what stopped this film from mutating into a weird vigilante-based superhero franchise.<br /><br />The cinematography is in my view rather unique and stunning for such a film as this. The acting is top-notch, though Foster carries too much of it by herself and Howard is left sort of panting after her in certain scenes. I know Foster wanted this film to be anti-gun, and approached it that way. She succeeded in evoking the opposite feelings, and I'd show this film to anyone, any age, who felt compelled to get a gun for self-defense.<br /><br />That is as far as I go in my appreciation of this film as gun advocacy; the producers would surely not thank me for it but there it is on screen! It is a real nail-biter, taught, tense and terrifying. A unique thing about this film is that I imagined every great director would have made it exactly the same way. That is one powerful film.<br /><br />Final note: read the review by Bama. Bama is a brave soul who was attacked like Erica Bain, and that made THE BRAVE ONE real and therapeutic for Bama. The idea that the victim is in a way dead, is post-crime a different person, is a powerful agony we must all try to understand. And Bama says something very Buddhist: you don't have to murder someone to take their life from them.<br /><br />If we learned that lesson, we wouldn't need any form of weapon at all.</p></body></html>

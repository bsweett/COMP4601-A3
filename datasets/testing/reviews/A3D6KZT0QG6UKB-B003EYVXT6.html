<meta name="summary" content="Even the few points of whimsy highlight the awfulness of this thing"></head><body><p>There's a point toward the end when the Spliced Monster has become a hot chick with a tail and bird legs and Adrian Brody puts on an old jazz record. For just a second, you think that this movie is going to go away from the hipster cliches and terrible acting and actually find a moment of whimsy in which to allow for a little space. Only Adrian Brody starts dancing and it's the most hammy bit of "look at me, I'm being cool" acting I've ever seen.<br /><br />In a movie where two terrible human beings are taking care of an alien monsters as the worst parents in the world, there is no one to like. One keeps trying to kill her and the other one steals her cat. Adrian Brody can't act. Sarah Polley keeps alternating between telling spliced daughter that she loves her and stealing her cat. Adrian Brody can't act.<br /><br />The story line is a dull plodding little number full of long tedious little set pieces (when the title character is actually spelling out Tedious on a Scrabble Board, it's almost as if someone on set is crying out for help) leading to perverse sexual politics make no sense whatsoever save for being very rapey.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></body></html>

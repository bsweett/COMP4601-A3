<meta name="summary" content="nice hollywood formula with a big budget and all stars"></head><body><p>There is no question that this is a fun film to watch.  You could not get a better cast, the script is intricate, tight and funny, and the production is completely lavish.  However, the soul of it is simply empty, like the formula has completely taken over the series, which plows ahead as inexorably as locomotive rolling down a hill.  This is the case with so many movies from hollywood that I hardly ever feel any excitement watching them.  Instead, with glitzy or not, they become background noise, to be played while the kids are occupied and I can do something else.<br /><br />The guys get back together because their pal (Gould) has been swindled.  The plan is to get the guy who did it.  Of course, it appears impossible.  And then, in addition to unforeseen complications, there are scams within scams within scams.  One fun thing is the reappearance of several former victims, adding to the fun.  Unfortunately, it fails to add up to much more than what came before, though with truly fine acting.  There are also many details you might want to watch a second time around, I will let the reader guess as to whether they succeed.<br /><br />This is pass time stuff that doesn't reach a level of quality I would want to own.  But I do.</p></body></html>

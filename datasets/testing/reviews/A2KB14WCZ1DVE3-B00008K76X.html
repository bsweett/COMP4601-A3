<meta name="summary" content="I know Jack Ryan, and Ben Affleck is..."></head><body><p>... well, not terrible.  I had big reservations about seeing this film, as I had heard how much it had strayed from the book.  Tom Clancy must have more money than some foreign countries.  Doesn't he have enough clout to dictate a true filming of his work?  Or enough money to say "Do it my way or not at all?".  <p>And to some degree I still agree with this thought.  The decision to diminish the Arab role as part of the bad-guy contingent is absolutely unforgivable.  What are they afraid of, that people might actually think that there are forces in the Middle East that would like to plant terror in the United States?  Who could think of such a thing?  No, let's put all the blame on the shoulders of those universal bad guys, the neo-Nazis.  <p>And going back in time in the Jack Ryan series was not a problem to me.  But to have him just meeting his future wife is an irritation.  If gives her the thankless role of playing the suffering girlfriend who sighs as her man saves the world.  Finally, does anybody else notice that the proximity all our heroes are to the nuclear device means that slow death by cancer is just around the corner?<p>All of the above in unforgivable, and yet, the novel was about more than these things.  It was about the sheer ruthlessness of what some people will do to achieve their ends.  This is well portrayed here, though I would have rather seen the religious fanaticism that fuels today's attacks used here.  It's about the toughness of making decisions when your country has just been attacked and you have to decide how many people you're going to kill in return.  And it's about the realization that even though The Cold War is over, the need for a strong military is probably necessary.  <p>Oh yes, Ben as Jack.  The movie does go overboard to show his uncomfortable ness in his new role with the CIA.  They didn't have to hit you over the head with this.  And he seems to know a lot of things that the rest of the world doesn't.  But when it gets down and dirty, he does handle the job credibly, and I wasn't prepared to say this.  I think the plot changes are more serious than casting him in the role, and if they can film a truer book next time, I can accept him as a more-confident Jack next time.</p></body></html>

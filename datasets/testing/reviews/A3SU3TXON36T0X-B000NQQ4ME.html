Durant.<br /><br />_Apocalypto_ (2006) is an excellent film directed by Mel Gibson that details the decline of Mayan civilization through the life of a young Indian who strives to protect his family.  Gibson's genius is apparent throughout the film as he effectively captures the atmosphere of this lost once great civilization.  The movie has much to say about man's tendency to over-reach his natural status within the world and through a Faustian bargain with demonic forces to eventually destroy both himself and nature.  The movie also is highly pertinent to our own times, in which Western civilization itself faces an imminent decline and through over-extension man has reached into once "primitive" and untapped regions of nature and demolished them.  The underlying force of Gibson's traditional Catholicism is apparent throughout the film, and at different places within the film the Mayan mythology appears to be aping the Catholic ritual.  To the Roman Catholic Christian, the appearance of elements in traditional cultures which bear a marked similarity to its own ritual are of no surprise as God reveals himself to all nations through Christ.  Gibson also shows the arrival of the Spaniards to Mexico in the film and presumably they will attempt to Christianize this fallen civilization that has become hopelessly corrupt by resorting to human sacrifice and chattel slavery and thus is in desperate need of Christ.  The movie treats the traditional Indian cultures with great respect and reverence, particularly that of the tribe of Jaguar Paw (the central character in this movie played by the Native American actor Rudy Youngblood).  However, the movie does not refrain from showing the brutality of the ancient Mayans who preyed off the forest tribes and whose sun god Kulkukan (the Mayan equivalent of Quetzalcoatl) demands human blood.  Gibson maintains that such cultural degradation can only foretell the coming doom of a civilization as is revealed in history through the Spanish conquerors.  The actors in the film all speak the Yucatec Mayan language throughout and the film relies on subtitles.  Gibson has claimed that the effect of hearing a foreign language spoken in a film (as he also did in his _Passion of the Christ_  with Aramaic) is important.<br /><br />The movie begins with Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and several fellow tribesmen hunting a tapir in the jungle.  It is noted by Flint Sky that his own father hunted this same jungle, that his son continues to hunt it, and that his son's son will hunt it after him, thus establishing the continuity of primordial tradition.  Such is the traditional way of life for the world's "primitive" nature-loving peoples.  It is after capturing the tapir that the tribesmen encounter a second traumatized tribe who tell of a coming doom.  Their own village has been ravished.  Jaguar Paw and his fellows return to their village but first Flint Sky tells him that he must resolve not to fear.  That night, one of the village elders tells a foreboding fable of human beings never fulfilling their wants and desires.  Perhaps this fable is an allegory for the greater environmental degradation (and the destruction of the very rain forest itself) which has occurred in our own times.  Jaguar Paw awakes from a prophetic and horrifying nightmare only to find that his village is being invaded by raiders.  The raiders ransack the village and kill many, raping the women, and leaving the children.  However, just before the village is destroyed and he himself is captured, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son at the bottom of a pit where they are to remain for the rest of the movie.  Perhaps the pregnant wife in the pit (the cave?) is meant to be reminiscent of the very Virgin Mary herself from Gibson's own religious tradition.  (The Virgin is to occur again in the prayers of one of the women as a slave for the lost children.)  Jaguar Paw and his villagers are taken away as slaves by the raiders and must trek through the jungle to arrive at the Mayan city.  There they are to be sacrificed on top of a step pyramid to the god Kulkukan.  The sacrificial ritual is meant to be reminiscent of the Roman mass.  The movie features an eclipse and an eerie prophecy followed by a horrendous occurrence at the ball field.  Following this Jaguar Paw runs through the jungle pursued by his enemies driven by pure hatred.  To see the resolution of the movie, and whether or not Jaguar Paw manages to save his pregnant wife and young son, you must watch it.  It should be noted though that the Christian theme becomes apparent again when Spanish missionaries and conquistadores show up in ships towards the end.  Thus, begins anew the history of the Americas.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has directed an excellent film in _Apocalypto_.  The movie includes humor but also much seriousness and bloodshed.  (Unfortunately this film is not to be recommended to the overly squeamish who may find certain scenes too upsetting, but to those few brave souls who can bear some of the more gruesome scenes the film has a positive message for all.)  The atmosphere is well done and the scenery and environment is accurate.  The movie is also historically interesting and Gibson has certainly done his homework on this ancient culture.  However, it is the central theme and allegorical nature of this film which I believe is most important for us today.  It tells us that we must stop over-extending ourselves and destroying nature and the traditional ways of life of "primitive" peoples.  Ultimately however, our hope must rest with God himself who effectively guides our destiny as a race.</p></body></html>

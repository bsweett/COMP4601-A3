First, the animation: Superb, as always, and things like hair and fur just get better at every turn of technology. Second, the plot: inept boy makes good despite the wrong-headed grownups, and the cute girl likes him in the end (as does everyone else).  Third, the misfits who just happen to fit together very well. You'll find out about that when you see it. Like a great chef making wonderful pastry from ordinary ingredients, Dreamworks cooks up these common elements into a delectable treat.<br /><br />So much for the big things, which all come together well. The little things really make this movie. For instance, there's the grizzled old wardog explaining that he lost his leg to a dragon because he's delicious, but that's just one moment in the ongoing banter. The fearsomely capable girl is good too, even if that role has become a commonplace. She'd whomp our hero at any known skill, so he comes out ahead using unknown skills. The awkwardness between dad and teen son has warmth enough, in a way that might bring the viewer's own past awkwardness back to life for just a moment. The dragons have as much personality as the humans, if not more, together with a few charming feline traits. And the hat ... again, you'll have to see that one for yourself.<br /><br />Art, story, characters: it all comes together in a great family entertainment. I'll see this one again.<br /><br />- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fairy tale enchantment on film!"></head><body><p>'Shyamalan's latest film is a quirky art film with a fairy tale sensibility.  The story revolves around a sad disillusioned man, Cleveland Heep, who has given up everything after the loss of his family.  Heep discovers a mystical creature, a narf, in the pool of the apartment complex he manages.  Malevolent forces lurk in the gardens around the pool which she must be protected against.  Ultimately this magical creature must be restored from whence she came.  This quest to save the narf ends up involving many of the oddball yet normal apartment dwellers Heep has come to know over time.  In the process of saving this creature, he find his own redemption and possibly hope for the future of our world.<br /><br />This move has an enchanting storyline with intricate plot twists.  The main stars, Paul Giamatti and Bryce Howard, are perfectly cast. Shyamalan plays a small, yet compelling role in the film. The look of the film is unadorned-these are ordinary people pursuing ordinary lives.  There is humor and pathos in the lives of these people.  Yet, when galvanized by the hope of something out of the ordinary and an opportunity to do good, these "normal" people gather around and give their all.  In essence this film shows the magic of the everday.<br /><br />This is a  fairy tale on film-with all the strangeness and skewed logic of the fairy tale world.  Not for those who are looking for a slick Hollywood film.</p></body></html>

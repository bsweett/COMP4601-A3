<meta name="summary" content="Unsettling but brilliant film"></head><body><p>I've somehow managed to put off seeing this movie for 11 years.  It was a conscious decision.  Director Darren Aronofsky's recent success with "Black Swan" and a cheap Blu ray price finally got me to watch it.  My original hesitation had to do with the subject matter and the fact I knew Jennifer Connelly's character Marion would be sexually abused.  Now I love to see beautiful women  but brutality and rape is not my thing.  Here Marion, her boyfriend played by Jared Leto, his friend played by Marlon Wayans and the mother of Leto's character all circle the drain strung out on drugs.  Sara is the mother and is brilliantly played by Ellen Burstyn.  She is hopped up on amphetamines prescribed by a quack doctor in an attempt to lose weight.  The other 3 are your typical beautiful young people whose future is compromised by a long stint hooked on your garden variety street drugs.  The acting is superb all the way around, but this is a difficult movie to watch.  It is gut wrenching and nauseating but has brilliance about it with the sights and sounds Aronofsky brings to film. I don't think I'll ever watch it again.</p></body></html>

HE DISCOVERS AN UNKNOWN FEMALE SINGER NAMED LINDA [CHRISTINA MILLIAN] AND HE TRYS TO GET HER SIGNED TO ATL RECORDS, WHICH IS OWNED BY THE NEWLY WIDOWED EDIE [UMA THURMAN]. SOME FUNNY MOMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THIS MOVIE, BUT THE MOVIE SUFFERS FROM BEING A LITTLE TOO LONG AND IT ALSO SUFFERS FROM TOO MANY BORING MOMENTS. IN ADDITION TO JOHN TRAVOLTA, THE ROCK [PLAYING A GAY BODYGUARD!], VINCE VAUGHN [PLAYING A WANNABE BLACK EXECUTIVE], AND CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER [PLAYING A GANGSTA RAP PRODUCER] ALL HELP TO SAVE THIS FILM.</p></body></html>

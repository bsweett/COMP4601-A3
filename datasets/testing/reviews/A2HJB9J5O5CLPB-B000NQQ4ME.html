It reminded me somewhat of Werner Herzog's work in South American. There's an epic jungle out there and the fiercest beast of all is, ah, us!<br /><br />I don't know if Gibson is clinically nuts.  His latest brush's with anti-Semitism and drunkenness were bizarre, but he does show all the characteristics of a wild-eyed-visionary-artist. Apocalypto is a fantastical recreation of a 600 year old Mayan civilization that out-DeMille's any Hollywood historical stuff I've ever seen. Gibson used a ton of his own loot to build a Mayan city so lifelike, it is obviously not computer generated.  The sets reminded me of earlier Gibson projects, a Gibsonionian Mad Max touch.<br /><br />The film begins with a bloody, but good-natured tribal hunt.  Rudy Youngblood soon learns that the city Mayans are out on the prowl looking for slaves. His village is decimated and the villagers are led off to the Gods.  Along the way, he observes the incredible brutality of the Mayan religion.  I won't describe the mayhem, but will warn the viewer that it's much like observing the work of lunatics in a concentration camp on LSD. If you're stomach can't hold on, keep a bucket by the couch because the effort is well worthwhile.</p></body></html>

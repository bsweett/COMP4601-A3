<meta name="summary" content="Two cowboys that really needed each other."></head><body><p>Widecreen. Rated "R". Running time: 2 hrs, 14 min.<br />Note: You will need to turn on your English subtitles for this one because some of the important dialogue can not be heard during important scenes.  This film has Spanish subtitles too at your option.<br />Why did I wait unti 2007 to see this film? Too embarassed to rent in public with all the controversy about it.<br /> I knew Ang Lee from his directing work on "The Hulk" and the stars of the film, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal I may have seen in a movie or two in the past, but could not place the face with the name until this film came out. I didn't even know the proper name of this film. I kept calling it "Broken Mountain".<br />  This story begins in Signal, Wyoming 1963.  Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet each other as the only two men that show up for a sheep-herding job. The two work on Brokeback Mountain together herding sheep from point A to point B. As two weeks go by, they share their life about each other and how they came to this point in their life. A friendship develops and becomes somewhat deeper.<br />  The job ends in August because of a storm. Jack mentions he might come back next summer.<br />  Ennis gets married in November to Alma. Because of work, their personal lives and living in different states, Jack and Ennis could not travel to see each other then.<br />  Ennis is getting frustrated by his wife and two kids. After four years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. He is driving all the way down to see Ennis. When they meet up, it's an emotional one. They hug tightly and kiss each other.<br />  For Ennis, he has been alone most of his life. He keeps himself inside, however Jack was able to open him and Ennis not happy with his married life, really missed Jack. Ennis didn't let those feelings out until he saw Jack again. Jack needs him too.<br />  Can this special friendship continue dispite the changes in their personal lives? Jack tries very hard.<br />  The Cinematography is beautiful and well done. The Original Score heart-tugging. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did incredible acting with Ledger's character having pinned up emotions so raw.<br /><br />  Heath Ledger and his co-star Michelle Williams met on the set of "Brokeback Mountain" and became engaged in real-life. Jake Gyllenhaal is godfather to their daughter. (Heath and Michelle separated in 2007. He was always with his daughter).<br /><br />  Larry McMurthy (The Last Picture Show 1971, Texasville 1990) along with Diana Ossana wrote the screenplay based upon a short story by Anne Proulx.<br /><br />  Brokeback Mountain (2005) won the Academy Award for Best Director--Ang Lee, Best Screenplay (Adapted), Original Score--Gustavo Santaolalla.<br />Also nominated for Best Actor--Heath Ledger, Best Supporting Actor--Jake Gyllenhaal, Best Supporting Actress-Michelle Williams,Best Cinematography.<br />  The 78th Academy Awards, March 5, 2006, paid homage to Brokeback Mountain (2005) by showing a montage of clips from other western cowboy movies with interesting "buddie" scenes.<br /><br />  This single disc DVD has no audio commentary, no deleted scenes, 3 featurettes, option of English, French. Option of subtitles: English, Spanish, French.<br />  SPOILER:<br />  I really hated the ending act of this film. It was almost a break-through film, but just as it's about to give you an emotional pay-off, it cuts you cold.<br />  Why is Hollywood so afraid of making a male friendship movie with a happy ending?<br /><br /> A very diffucult film for both actors to do, but they both gave outstanding performances.<br /><br />Update: Heath Ledger died January 22, 2008, from an accidental overdose Acute intoxication, combined effects of painkillers, sleeping pills, anti-anxiety medication and other prescription drugs. He was 28. Heath had said he was not sleeping well, 2 or 3 hours only, because he was distraught about his role as the "Joker" in the new Batman movie, THE DARK KNIGHT (2008). He had a hard time getting out of the character. he also was separated from Michelle Williams and missed his daughter.<br />  His housekeeper found him naked laying face down at the foot of his bed. She came in to tell him his masseur had arrived.<br />  He will be missed! Rest in peace, Heath.<br /><br />  While The Dark Knight (2008) was already completed, he was filming The Imagination of Doctor Parnassus (2009). Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Ferrell will continue his changing character in the film. The scenes with Heath Ledger will stay in the film.</p></body></html>

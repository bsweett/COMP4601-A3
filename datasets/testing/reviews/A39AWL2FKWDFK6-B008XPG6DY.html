<meta name="summary" content="Blackmail and retribution"></head><body><p>Mikael Hafstrom's direction of the film "Derailed" closely followed the novel by James Siegal excepting the change of locale from New York to Chicago.  The film proved to be an average adaptation of what was a good crime drama.<br /><br />Advertising executive Charles Schine played by Clive Owen has a chance encounter aboard a train with financial advisor Lucinda Harris played by Jennifer Aniston.  Even though both are married they soon end up in a seedy downtown hotel pursuing an extramarital affair.  Their encounter gets rudely and violently interrupted by a break in to the hotel room by criminal Philippe Laroche played by Vincent Cassel.  Cassel proceeds to rob them, then pistolwhip Owen and rape Aniston.<br /><br />Aniston begs Owen to refrain from calling the police causing him to be the target of an elaborate blackmail scheme by Cassel.  He is bilked of substantial savings he had put aside to pay for medical treatment earmarked for his daughter who has a rare and deadly form of diabetes.<br /><br />Owen then wises up and follows Aniston after seeing her again commuting on the train and realizes that she's in cahoots with Cassel and in the process of setting up another mark.  Getting his hackles up he plots to get retribution and the $120,000 extorted from him.</p></body></html>

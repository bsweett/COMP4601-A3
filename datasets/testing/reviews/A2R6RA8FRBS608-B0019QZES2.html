<meta name="summary" content="Good for some laughs and light hearted entertainment."></head><body><p>This film is, as many may already know, the sequel to the 2000 film called "Meet The Parents" in which Greg Focker (played by Ben Stiller) struggles to get the approval of his girlfriend's father (played by Robert De Niro). Teri Polo does a good job of playing Greg's girlfriend, Pam Byrnes.<br /><br />In the sequel it is now time for Pam's parents to travel to meet her boyfriend Greg's parents. Predictably, the two sets of potential in-laws couldn't be further apart. Greg's parents are a throwback to a commune-type 1960's relationship while that is hardly what Pam's parents are about.<br /><br />The film is well cast and that's a treat: Barbra Streisand plays Greg's mother; she is very funny and keeps up her part of the jokes! Dustin Hoffman is Greg's father, Mr. Focker; it's great to see him, too. He does a fine job. Robert De Niro of course plays Pam's Dad and Blythe Danner plays Pam's Mom.<br /><br />Without spoiling it for you, there are numerous funny moments that will entertain you if you keep in mind that this is a somewhat amusing comedy. Some of the jokes could be considered crude by some people but then again the title is a hint at that!<br /><br />I would recommend that you go see this movie for some fun, light hearted entertainment. It may not be the very best comedy you'll see ever in your entire lifetime, but it's one of the better ways to overcome a dull afternoon!</p></body></html>

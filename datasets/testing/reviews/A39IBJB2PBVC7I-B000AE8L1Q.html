<meta name="summary" content=""My Love She's Like Some Raven At My Window With A Broken Wing""></head><body><p>Those famous words by Bob Dylan say a lot about the love in this movie. The characters here, especially the adults, are damaged, unable to cope with major disappointments and challenges in their lives. Denny Davies, Costner, once had it all. A star pitcher for a pro ball team, he is now reduced to talking sports on the radio and selling autographs, two lonely occupations that give him no pleasure. Terry Wolfmeyer, rich and mother of four lovely girls, has been abandoned by her husband. Both have descended into a state of perpetual inebriation, never severe enough to be life threatening, always severe enough to keep real emotions and maturity away. They bump together not because of love's strong magnetism, but rather, because unanchored boats in a harbor eventually must bump into each other during storms.<br /><br />The great strength of the movie is that these people are not attractive, they're whiny, cynical, self-pitying, narcissistic drunks. They hang together out of convenience and desperation, in time, some sort of affection develops. But Terry has to push Denny pretty hard before he can relocate the confidence and focus he must have had on the mound, and demand something real. It's a defining moment in the film, a moment when Terry and Denny realize the four daughters are far more mature than they are. In case you don't know the movie's surprise ending I will only say that in the final analysis it only cements what should have been pretty obvious already.  That is, both these people were extremely blessed and their wallowing, while understandable, is best viewed as a necessary stage of grieving and not a lifestyle.<br /><br />A point of clarification about the leads. Joan Allen is one of our best actresses, incapable of delivering anything less than a stellar performance. Mr. Costner, by contrast, earned this role I'm happy to say. It was not always thus. Before there was a Brad Pitt, before there was a Tom Cruise, the handsome young idiot devoid of acting talent women adored was Kevin Costner. The young Costner was so stiff on camera that blocks of wood actually complained that he was giving them a bad name. (For a great example, sample his performance in The Untouchables, you would bet he was holding his script.) Because of his completely undeserved success Costner was allowed to stick around and make more movies. In the process, he improved a good bit. In TUOA we see how much.<br /><br />Costner is loose in this role, rumpled, casual, messed up. Just right. When he does show passion, it's believable. That's a pleasure. To see Costner holding his own with an actress of Joan Allen's stature, and actually creating a meaningful synthesis that causes us to care, is an accomplishment. This is a smart, beautifully made movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

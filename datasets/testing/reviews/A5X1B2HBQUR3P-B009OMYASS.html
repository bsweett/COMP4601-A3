<meta name="summary" content="Call me retard or whatever....but great sadistic gore."></head><body><p>A movie with realistic gore. The movie is crticized for sadistic gore, but its unfair to judge the movie as a censor or non approver of the genre. To rate a movie you must first enjoy the genre. You see sick horror is not everyone's cup of tea and for the people who do enjoy it, it is not a reflection of a freak sadistic nature of theirs. Its just that such movies peek our human curiosities. Its just a dare thing. Can we stand through this sick blood fest. It's also to explore the sick depravity of human nature. The stuff that happens in HOSTEL is something that serial killers do. We have heard the sordid tales. I know its gross, such sort of this violence is out there somewhere in the world happening all the time even as you read this review. Such movies just tap into our curious voyeuristic tendencies to see to what extents evil intents can hurt and kill others. In that we are just trying to do a reality check and want to get offended and turn away from the sick gore but then again we turn back and complete the movie and only to test our limits. All the gore elements are present and the gore is very realistically portrayed. The plot of internet based business elite hunting where people with money can get the satisfaction of tortuing and killing other people for 50 grand also raises questions for me  -- "Is is actually happening in some part of the world". The movie does not have the fatalistic approach of "Saw", there can be some light at the end for atleast one of our characters. Also apart from the gore, you also got suspense till atleast half way through the movie where you are trying to make sense of why all this is happening and why this sick nonsense ...whats the purpose. That is part of the fun.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Planet of the Apes"></head><body><p>An astronaut trying to retrieve a monkey in space ends up landing on a planet inhabited by talking human-like apes. Leo Davidson finds himself captured by the apes and placed in a cage with other humans. All the apes take this same 'human hating' attitude, with the exception of one. A kind, female ape called Ari sees something different in these humans, and plans to help them in whatever they need to do. The story the, direction equals perfect. I could not dream of a better movie to see. It was quiet unique about the story about how he traveled in time. And the end, it was quiet interasting how this movie ended, too. When it's good, it comes to being great.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mind blowing"></head><body><p>That's not really true. I didn't find this movie all that mind blowing.<br /><br />Realistically, noone expects this movie to win any oscars. However, it is a little bit funner than most of Paul W.S. Anderson's other masterpieces. The thing is, you will be laughing at the action rather than be exhilarated by it. My favorite part in the movie is when they take a shortcut through a cemetary. It's priceless.<br /><br />The only bad part about the movie, besides the script, acting, and plot, is the fact that our heroine is now super-human like. She just seems impossible to defeat as she can kill a million zombies with her kung fu abilities.</p></body></html>

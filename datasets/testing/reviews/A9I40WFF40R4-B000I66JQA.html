<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant Movie"></head><body><p>I would have given this movie the Oscar for best movie of 2002. Adapted from Michael Cunningham's fine novel and directed by Stephen Daldry, who, as I remember, directed BILLY ELLIOTT as well, this film has everything going for it: first rate acting by everyone involved, beautiful cinematography, music by Philip Glass-- a composer I'm usually not into, but his compositions work perfectly here-- and a thoughtful plot. <p>The action covers one day in the lives of each of three women. We see Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) on the day she commits suicide in 1923. We visit Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) on a day in 1951, the day she decides not to commit suicide; and finally, Clarissa Vaughn played by Meryl Streep on a day in 2001 when she is planning a party for her writer friend Richard (Ed Harris)who is dying of AIDS. The action goes back and forth among these three dates. Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughn are connected to Virginia Woolf because of her novel MRS. DALLOWAY. Laura Brown is reading MRS. DALLOWAY, Virginia Woolf is working on the novel and Richard calls Clarissa &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;  <p>The photography is quite wonderful here and helps to hold the movie together. For example, the same images are repeated in each time sequence. Virginia arrives at the first line of her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers, herself&quot;and proceeds to arrange flowers. Laura's husband buys her flowers for &quot;his&quot; birthday, which she arranges. Finally Clarissa goes shopping to buy tons of flowers for Richard's party. There are also images of eggs being broken as the characters prepare food, the different women in bed, the scenes of the three women washing their faces, the three women kissing other women, and finally, on each day someone arrives early. These visual images make the plot even smoother than in the novel, I think.<p>Much has been made of Kidman's false nose. Nobody would recognize her as the stunning Australian actress here as she is quite frumpy as Woolf. Meryl Streep is as alway magnificent. There is a stunning scene when she meets the older Laura Brown who makes her apology for leaving her children-- &quot;I chose life.&quot; Clarissa says nothing in words to condemn Laura. Her eyes tell it all. Acting doesn't get finer than this. As I recall Ed Harris got mixed reviews when the movie first opened. I am at a loss to understand why. He is totally believable as someone in the last stages of AIDS; indeed, some of his scenes are almost too painful to watch.<p>There are great lines in this film, some of them straight out of the novel. Woolf: &quot;Even crazy people want to be asked.&quot; She wanted to &quot;look life in the face.&quot; Richard: &quot;I have to face the hours.&quot; &quot;I have stayed alive for you. Now you [Clarissa] have to let me go.&quot; Clarissa remembers a day years ago when she and Richard were young and in love and there was such a sense of possibility. &quot;We thought it was the beginning of happiness, but it was happiness.&quot;<p>The movie says so much about so many things that are important-- death, suicide, insanity, illness, friendship and, above all, love. I don't mean to make the movie sound trite. Is is far from that. People will be watching it years from now.</p></body></html>

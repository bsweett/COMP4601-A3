<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Documentary"></head><body><p>Simply intriguing documentary about the life of penguins in Antartica and how they breed.  The journey that both the male and female each take in the frigid cold is simply mind boggling.  The camerea work is just superb especially in such frigid harsh weather.  How did the camera men endure such hardship?<br /><br />It was just amazing watching the male and female penguin pass the eggs back and forth protecting the egg.  Interesting how penguins survive for months without food and waht they go through to protect their young from predators and sometimes each other.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is superb as the narrator.  I found the scenery quite beautiful and relaxing.  An educational masterpiece.</p></body></html>

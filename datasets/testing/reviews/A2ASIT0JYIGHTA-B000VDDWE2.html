<meta name="summary" content="It makes you think ..."></head><body><p>This movie explores various changes in weather patterns and how a change in ocean currents can have drastic effects.  It also discusses global warming.  I live in a continent that is currently going through its worst drought in centuries, while other parts of the world are soaked in rain.  Both scenarios are considered part of the greenhouse effects, and results of damage we have done to our earth.<p>The movie was great for the first half, impressive storyline and effects.  But then the Hollywood formual stepped in, and we got bored.  It became predictable and tended to drag on, not to mention how far-fetched it became.<p>It's best point is that it makes you think "will it happen, and if so, when?"<p>Should be seen on the big screen to appreciate the stunning visual effects.</p></body></html>

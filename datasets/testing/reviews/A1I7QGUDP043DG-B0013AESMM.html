I love a movie that brings a real issue into your living room while entertaining through a dramatic story. It certainly can inspire a dialogue with other viewers. Foster plays a victim who is turned emotionally inside-out when she and her fiance are brutally beaten by street thugs. She recovers from her physical wounds, but her mental status takes longer to heal when she wakes up in the hospital to find her fiance died of his injuries. A part of her dies as well, leaving her almost as cold as the killers. A question in this movie will probably be debated by many viewers: was the character justified in her actions?<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

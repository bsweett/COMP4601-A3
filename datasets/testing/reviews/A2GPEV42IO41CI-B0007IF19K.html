<meta name="summary" content="Jamie Foxx gives a remarkable performance"></head><body><p>This stunning bio-pic stars Jamie Foxx as legendary singer Ray Charles.  We see in flashbacks how Ray grew up in utter poverty, was blinded by glaucoma at the age of seven, lost both his brother and mother by age 15, yet rose to become a world-famous singer and song writer.  Ray had a serious drug habit and was an unfaithful husband, yet his remarkable talent and determination helped him move from playing in smoky dives to elegant theatres, with numerous gold records and Grammy awards to his credit.<br /><br />I had heard so much talk about Jamie Foxx's amazing performance I didn't think he could possibly be that good, but his performance was indeed astonishing.  He looks and acts so much like Ray Charles, that I forgot it was an actor playing a part.  Foxx absolutely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor.  The supporting cast is also excellent, the story is fascinating, and there are many exciting musical performances of Ray's hits that are sure to put a smile on your face.  Heartily recommended.<br /><br />Kona</p></body></html>

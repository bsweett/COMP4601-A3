<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Rear Window&quot; is Hitchcock at his BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>This amazing director Alfred Hitchcock got the nod for 4 of AFI's (American Film Institute's) top 100 movies in 100 years (1998).  This incredible feat showcases &quot;Hitch&quot; at his very best !!!!  His greatest run began with his greatest movie &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), then Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) and his most famous horror thriller, Psycho (1960) all on AFI's list.<p>Rear Window's cast was meticulously chosen and performed perfectly and flawlessly.  This movie is the perfect blend of story, cinematography, acting, music, drama, suspense and most of all COLOR.  Digitally restored masterfully you now can enjoy the artist pallet at its best.<p>In summary; An adventure magazine photographer (James Stewart) is in his 6th week being wheelchair bound from a broken leg in a 2 room apartment overlooking the courtyard of an apartment complex in New York.  Socialite girlfriend (the most beautifully photographed closeup sequence of Grace Kelly) tries to persuade the reluctant Stewart to be allowed into his high adventure life.  Along with his physical therapist (Thelma Ritter) the trio get involved in a peeping Tom scenario of the neighbors &amp; the possibility of a  husband (Raymond Burr) killing &amp; disposing of his wife?  The girlfriend and therapist become predators to find the body.  Stewart becomes the victim of the husband &amp; the rest is history.<p>This the greatest movie and Grace Kelly is absolutely gorgeous!!!<p>Plenty of backgound information and incites from &quot;Hitch's&quot; daughter Patricia Hitchcock.<p>You've got to see &quot;Rear Window&quot; and then you will want to see more of this directors work.  You can't lose with &quot;Rear Window&quot;!!!!!</p></body></html>

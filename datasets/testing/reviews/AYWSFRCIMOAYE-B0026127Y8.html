The emotion is raw.<br /><br />The dialogues between  Bryan Mills and his wife are heart-wrenching and bitter even though they did not talk with each other much. Most of the times, his wife blamed him of neglecting his family. He did not answer to these words but I saw pain on his face.<br /><br />The weakness of this movie is it has big logical holes. For example, in one of the scenes, Bryan was handcuffed to a pipe. Yet he somehow, swiftly and miraculously disengaged from the pipe and killed the bad guys.<br /><br />Overall, it's rivetingly entertaining. It's the first good movie I've seen in 2009.</p></body></html>

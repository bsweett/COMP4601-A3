<meta name="summary" content="This is not a comedy, far from it"></head><body><p>What's there to like? First and foremost, its innovative treatment of a romantic relationship. I like the opening with many photos of Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston)when they were happy together. Their big quarrel which precipitated the break-up was quite heavy and distressing - the arguments embodied the essence of differences between a man and a woman. The last half an hour where Brooke gave up all hopes after pulling all her tricks for a reunion prove to be a better turn. Once their relationship offered nothing for them to linger on, Jennifer Aniston gave a very credible performance when she had one last cry over the shattered wreck. I also like the ending where both were radiant, successful and hopeful of each own's future. A predictable ending would completely destroy the movie.<br /><br />What's there to beg disbelief? In the middle of separation but trapped under the same roof, no way could dare to provoke Gary to such great extent as Brooke did, fearless as she could be. It was also quite improbable that Brooke as attractive, trendy and classy as Jennifer Aniston could find no other substitute but wait for Gary. Similarly, Gary like Vince Vaughn could easily date someone else, let alone admit to some extent his share of responsibility in the break-up.<br /><br />What could have been a surprise? Find someone not so attractive as Brooke and Gary, then the break-up could be more realistic and thought provoking. Also on the DVD, it seems one could choose the "his" or "hers" to play the movie, though I detected no distinguishable difference in the two versions. It would be nice to have different versions, one from his point of view and one from hers, on what really went wrong on the relationship. (Exactly what Divorce His, Divorce Hers - Richard Burrton and Elizabeth Taylor - did. )After all, it took two to start and finish a quarrel.<br /><br />So don't expect this to be any comedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very funny 70's spoof/homage"></head><body><p>Todd Phillips (Road Trip, Old School) directed this spoof of the titular cop pair from the 70's.  Detective's Starsky (Ben Stiller) and Hutch (Owen Wilson) are teamed up together and are soon assigned to track down a drug dealer (Vince Vaughn) who's brand of cocaine is undetectable.  As the above Amazon review states, Stiller and Wilson may be a great comic pair, but it's Vaughn who steals the entire film with his hilarious, deadpan performance.  Snoop Dogg also has a scene stealing turn as informant Huggy Bear, as the rapper turned actor finds himself perfectly cast here.  Starsky & Hutch is lighthearted fun for the most part, and Phillips' energetic direction makes this spoof/homage worth seeing.  Also featuring Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, Juliette Lewis, Jason Bateman, Fred Williamson, and an uncredited (and memorable) Will Ferrel.</p></body></html>

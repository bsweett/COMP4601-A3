<meta name="summary" content="Realistic"></head><body><p>Based on actual events of two missing British female backpackers, this movie does pull you in, although is rather slow moving for the first half.  Wolf Creek was a surprise hit at the Australian Box Office considering horror films have been out of sorts for some time.  Wolf Creek works for AUstralian audiences in particular because we are all so familiar with a number of back packer murders in the Australian outback.<br /><br />Wolf Creek has a reasonably eeery atmosphere, and as mentioned above, is more realistic than say another torture film "Hostel".  "Hostel", while effective, is hard to take seriously as what is depicted has never actually happened in the country the film was set in, or anywhere that I have heard of.</p></body></html>

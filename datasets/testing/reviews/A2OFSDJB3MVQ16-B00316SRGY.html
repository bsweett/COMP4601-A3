<meta name="summary" content="Clint's near masterpiece"></head><body><p>I was shocked that the Academy virtually ignored this fine film and heaped praise upon the over-rated "Slumdog Millionaire" when this film explores the important issues of assimiliation and gang violence as well as "Slumdog" did but with so much more power.  If Eastwood is implying that this is "farewell" movie than he couldn't choose better one to sign off on.  Yet as one reviewer stated you could nit-pick that neighborhood Clint's character lives in is basically Africain American but doesn't deflate what the movie is about.  Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is probably one of the most complex and ambiguous character that he has ever played.  No wonder that the National Board of Review voted him "Best Actor of the Year"----and this is from a nation-wide survey of critics across the country.  Like another perennial Oscar best actor loser, Peter O'Toole, Clint may just have to accept a "Achievement Award" from the Academy. Anyway, shame on you Academy--it's really about politics and not about quality since how can an Italian comedian (Roberto Benigi) win for the atrocious "Life is Beautiful" (probably thanks to the Weinstein's constant promotion).</p></body></html>

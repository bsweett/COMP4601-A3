<meta name="summary" content="good enough way to spend a rainy afternoon"></head><body><p>Some people rip this movie to pieces for various scientific implausibilities, I like to look at it as a two hour comic book, a good way to pass a rainy afternoon.<br />Yes, it is unlikely that a scientific loner working alone in the desert for 20 years on a shoestring budget could develop a miracle rock cutting laser drill and a miracle alloy(?) he calls Unobtainium, but it looked good on screen.<br />The silliest bits I saw in the whole plot were the three month construction time (three years would be super speedy),the crystal geode like cave miles down our heroes briefly get trapped in, the giant diamonds they collide with (in a flow of magma?, I 'd say the heat would destroy them)and that super X-Ray I guess they used to see their way to the core (three feet of lead from 50 feet away?, that kind of power in an X-Ray would kil anyone near it). That stuff still looked pretty good though and they were the worst of the effects.<br />I thought that the emergency shuttle landing in the L.A. river channel looked very good but hokey at the end, the disoriented birds in London scene looked real, the San Francisco and Rome scenes were good, Rome better.<br />I found the cause of the rotation failure to be interesting and as believable as anything in the movie (if stronger than likely reality). It turns out that there was an Us vs. Them(who were they?) arms race in which both sides built a planet damaging bomb, the other guys tested theirs first with disastrous results.I also liked the way Our leaders were going to save the day by setting their own bomb off, until the crew of the Virgil got word back to the staff hacker (who was supposed to hack the internet to keep the disaster secret)who then hacked into the bomb base and basically turned the lights off just in the nick of time.<br />Not a great movie, kind of like the old 50's stuff with better FX, and slow at times but I still say it's a good way to use up some spare time.</p></body></html>

The acting and writing was great in this story from the heart about a young woman hoping to find a way out of her unhappy marriage through her gift for cooking great pies. When she discovers she's pregnant all her dreams feel crushed, until she falls in love with the town's new doctor. A great movie!<br /><br />Adrienne Shelly's death is a great loss and she will be missed deeply.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

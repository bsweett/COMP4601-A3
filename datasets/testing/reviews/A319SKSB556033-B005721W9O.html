This is mainly due to the fact that Dreamworks clearly cut the film down in post-production to make it a 'nice and safe' PG family film. It mostly feels like an extension of the meta-fictional show it is mocking than a genuine Star Trek parody.<br /><br />Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith, a mostly washed-up actor famous for only one role (a situation Allen himself should be familiar with) on the long-gone Galaxy Quest TV show. His life is nothing more than public appearances (in character) along with the rest of his disgruntled, weary co-stars. But an oddball race of naive octopus creatures called Thermians, from the other side of the universe mistakenly interpret the show as historical documents and beam-up Nesmith and his crew to an exact replica of their fictional spaceship to fight off the evil Sarris, a reptilian warlord dead-set on acquiring the mysterious 'Omega-13'.<br /><br />My biggest greivance with Galaxy Quest is that the production design is just so b-l-a-n-d. Most of the film is gray, gray, and more shades of gray. Give us something pretty to look at! David Newman, who seems to be the go-to guy for family movie scores, offers a very poor melody for the Galaxy Quest TV show (and therefor the whole movie). I didn't expect Goldsmith to parody his own Star Trek work for this, but SOMEONE better than Newman could have worked wonders.<br /><br />They had lightning in a bottle with Galaxy Quest but it fizzled out when they lost sight of any epic feel. As a TV movie it would have been great, as a theatrical effort it does indeed fall short of the mark. But I'll watch Alan Rickman in almost anything and Missi Pyle is also especially cute.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.35:1 1080p and Dolby TrueHD. A fair amount of self-congratulatory extras are included.</p></body></html>

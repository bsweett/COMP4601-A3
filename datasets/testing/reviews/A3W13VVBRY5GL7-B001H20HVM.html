<meta name="summary" content="'Saw II - Landing A Paycheck'"></head><body><p>I loved 'Saw'. Above everything else, I apprciated the originality and the flair with which it was made.<br /><br />I didn't love 'Saw II'. Not to suggest that it's a bad movie, because it's not. But it's not half as good as its prequel.<br /><br />This time round, bent cop Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) must find a way to help his wayward son Daniel out of serial killer Jigsaw's booby-trapped house of horrors, along with eight other victims, before they inhale too much toxic nerve gas. The catch? Eric must do this remotely, as Jigsaw's not feeling very helpful, and the only link between father and son is a video feed of the victim's progress. It's 'Big Brother' meets 'Silence of the Lambs', although not in a very original way.<br /><br />Put simply, 'Saw II' is a more mainstream and much less satisfying movie than the original. Think of the differences between 'Blair Witch' and 'Book of Shadows' and you'll know what I mean - even if 'Saw II' is infinitely superior to the Blair Witch sequel. Instead of two men caught in a claustrophobic web of hoplessness, we now have nine stereotypical criminals with broadly-drawn personalities (the hooker, the tough guy, the flake, the crazy, the wise one, the kid... and so forth...) running afoul of an increasingly more elaborate and blatantly obvious series of booby traps. There's no real sense of tension to this, and the obvious voyeurism with which director Darren Lynn Bousman shows the various deaths serves only to annoy fans of the careful atmosphere of the original, and bore everyone else - we've seen it all before. Okay, so there's a time limit on how long the kidnap victims can survive with the gas - so what? We already know most of them will die, anyway, so what's the use in getting excited about it?<br /><br />But still, 'Saw II' does have some good points. The overall standard of acting is much, much higher than in the original, with Donnie Wahlberg turning in a convincing and fluid performance as Eric. Tobin Bell as Jigsaw gets a much meatier role in this movie than in the first, and plays it well enough. And while the direction is not at all as successful as the original movie, it's still decent enough, and does lack the superfluous 'fluffing' of the prequel.<br /><br />The dialogue is still awful, mind you, and this is not a movie you need to own. The first twist in the tale can be seen coming from a hundred miles away (although there is a nice link between the first and second movies, here), but the ultimate twist is a satisfying one.<br /><br />A very average horror movie, and one to rent, not to buy.</p></body></html>

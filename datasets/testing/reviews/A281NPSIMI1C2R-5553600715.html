The previews gave me more chills, but honestly there is nothing really scary in this movie. It just made me feel "tense." You wait in anticipation for something absolutely scary to happen and the most scary thing is the curtains being left open.<br /><br />Reading the reviews here at Amazon makes this movie worth watching. I mean, watching and then reading. GLBT's review had me almost rolling on the floor. It was worth watching the movie to understand why he said what he did. Sweetmolly's review is probably more in line with how I felt about the movie. Lleu Christopher (Author of The Stone of Alexandria) mentioned it reminded him of "Rebecca" and I have to agree. Although I found "Rebecca" more creepy.<br /><br />There is this one scene where Nicole gets walloped with a door that is quite hilarious in a slapstick type way. Finally there was some comic relief. Otherwise there is a "certain tension" throughout the movie. Nicole is perfect for the role of the obsessive compulsive mother.<br /><br />You don't understand the implication until the creepy twist at the end. I want to start asking questions about the "logic of the story," however that would completely give away the interesting aspects. You will also feel yourself becoming very skeptical about the characters as the movie progresses.<br /><br />What you basically have is an obsessive mother living in a mansion in a misty woods where she keeps all the curtains closed. She believes her children to be photosensitive (acutely sensitive to all forms of Ultra Violet light) and keeps the light out of the rooms by locking one door and then opening the next. To get to her children, she has to lock and unlock doors. This adds a bit of fun when she has to get to them when she thinks they are screaming. Except her children are not the ones making the noise. It is a boy named Victor who she can't see, but her children can see.<br /><br />The entire story occurs at one house with most of the activity occurring inside one room or the other.<br /><br />They really don't develop the characters. We know they are religious, but we have no ideas what they actually enjoy doing. The children only study, the mother only locks doors and embroiders. There are a few religious discussions. The script writers make a  point of having the children question religion in a way that is beyond their understanding.<br /><br />Not riveting, but interesting from an artistic perspective. If you are waiting for blood to drip through cracks in an old wood floor, you will be slightly disappointed. What is impressive is a movie with a lack of sex, swearing (can't remember any) and slaughter. It proves a movie can be entertaining without being excessive.<br /><br />Honestly, this is a nice movie you can watch on a quiet evening and not feel afraid to walk down the hallway to bed. I'm pretty sure that was not the case if you saw it in the theatre.<br /><br />Intellectual Horror with Old-Fashioned Appeal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></body></html>

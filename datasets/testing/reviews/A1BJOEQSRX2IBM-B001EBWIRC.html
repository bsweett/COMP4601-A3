<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Movies of All Time!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best detective mysteries ever, great acting all around, Humphrey Bogart is superb as the fast-talking Sam Spade, Peter Loore and Sydney Greenstreet, two of the greatest character actors, give superb  performances as the villains. Mary Astor and Elisha Cook Jr. are also good.  Great dialogue and a twisted story-line, courtesy of Dashiell Hammett. John  Huston couldn't of had a better directing debut, he then went on to become  one of the greatest directors of all time. The confrontations between  Bogart and Elisha Cook are amusing and the story keeps you hooked all the  way through. Great film-noir elements and superb casting make this one of  the all-time greats. Extras: that's Walter Huston (John Huston's father) as  Capt. Jacobi. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Works for the uninitiated"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A long film that doesn't feel long, Watchmen is an astonishing visual experience (for all his faults director Zach Snyder sure can craft a pretty frame) that has its flaws--the scenes with Rorschach work far better than anything with Matthew Goode or Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman, some of the flashbacks don't make much sense to neophytes--but Jackie Earle Haley is great, the CGI is very effective, and the film works as *spectacle* even when it fails a little as a story; no one can deny that Watchman has issues, but it succeeds despite them.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

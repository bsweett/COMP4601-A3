<meta name="summary" content="Fine Tuned Machine"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy. Because I just now saw it, I can't really compare it to the first film, The Bourne Identity. This sequel was a fine-tuned machine.<br /><br />Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne. He's the guy who was trained to be an assassin and then lost his memory. That was the first film.<br /><br />Supremacy picks up with Bourne and his girlfriend living in India trying to keep a low profile. Unfortunately, another hitman, played by Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings) finds them and kills the girl.<br /><br />This causes Bourne to do what any distraught hitman would do; seek revenge and answers from those who did it.<br /><br />Enter the Federal Agent who knows nothing about the first movie, Joan Allen. Who assisted by Julia Stiles and Brian Cox engaged with Bourne in a case of mistaken identity and assumptions made wrong. (seemed to be the weekend for those kind of films**see Bend it Like Beckham review**)<br /><br />The fighting scenes are great. The car crashes that were used in the first film are used again. So basically it's a similar film, but you continue to learn a bit about Bourne. Can't wait to see the next one.</p></body></html>

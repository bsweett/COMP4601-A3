<meta name="summary" content="Alien - A true Sci-Fi treasure in the genre!"></head><body><p>&quot;Alien&quot; is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format!  It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film.  If you're looking for a lot of action, this film is not really what you're looking for; &quot;Aliens&quot; is where the intensity and action comes into play in the line of Alien movies; the whole theme behind &quot;Alien&quot; is to scare to pants off of you with extremely intense scenes and if you've never seen this movie before, it may very well do just that!  Never before in the history of this genre had there been a film of this magnitude and few have matched it in it's intensity since.<p>Now, with this latest release, fans of &quot;Alien&quot; are treated to the best release of this film yet.  The very first thing you'll notice when you put this DVD into your player is that you have the option of playing either the 1979 Theatrical Release or a 2003 Director's Cut.  The 2003 Director's Cut is preceded by an interesting introduction by Ridley Scott himself.  This cut is put together seamlessly and the additions to the film add just that much more flavor to the film, making it that much better.  The only downside to this edition and I believe this just stems from the time in which this film was made, was the audio.  Despite having the options of THX and 5.1 Dolby Surround or 5.1 DTS, the audio playback just isn't what it should be.<p>Copious amounts of credit and accolades go to the incredible cast for this outstanding cinematic treasure!  Although I wouldn't go so far as to say that &quot;Alien&quot; is &quot;the&quot; movie that made Sigourney Weaver a star, I would say that it was the one that made her a superstar!  And since the release of this film and the following three in the Alien legacy, she will forever be known for these roles and probably very few others, except maybe her role in &quot;Ghostbusters.&quot;<p>Director Ridley Scott, who has directed some of the most influential films in just over the past quarter century, deserves high praise and acclaim for &quot;Alien&quot; and the direction he took this film in.  There are several directors out there that may have made as many or more films than he has but few have enjoyed the success he has had and a lot of that success can be directly attributed to the work he did on this film!<p>The Premise:<p>Although never clearly defined as to when, it is the future and America has expanded Earth's atmosphere and is sending mining ships out there...  The Nostromo, a civilian mining vessel is making the return trip home from an expedition and the crew is in cryo-freeze for the trip home but &quot;Mother&quot; the ships computer wakes them up to investigate what appears to be an alien SOS message.<p>As the crew goes through the necessary steps to investigate the signal on a small planetoid, the tension builds right to the moment that Kane (John Hurt) is deep within the bowels of the alien ship and is leaning over what appears to be an egg...<p>What follows from there is most certainly one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers ever to have been brought to the silver screen.  I highly recommend this exceptional film to any and all who're fans of movies in this genre.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>For those that have been waiting for a special edition DVD of &quot;Alien&quot; with all of the bells and whistles, this edition is most assuredly it!<p>-1979 Theatrical Version (Deleted/Extended Scene Index) (Alien Vs.

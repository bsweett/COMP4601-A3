<meta name="summary" content="The Best  of the "Saw" Movies"></head><body><p>Tobin Bell returns as the diabolical "Jigsaw" in this excellent 3rd installment of the now-famous "Saw" series.  This movie picks up right where part II left off.  We see Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) slamming the door on a well and truly trapped Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg).  "Game's over", she mutters as she leaves.  But is the game over for Matthews?  It is for one other part II carryover; Kerry (Dina Meyer).  She is investigating the death of a former ex-con who has died in a most brutal manner.  At first, she doesn't expect Jigsaw was involved, but she soon learns otherwise as the video retrieved from the crime scene shows.<br /><br />Soon, Kerry is abducted by Amanda and she meets the same gruesome demise as the crime scene victims she used to investigate.  But the real story follows .<br /><br />There are two story lines in this movie.  One deals with Jigsaw's worsening brain tumor.  Realizing his condition is deterorating, he instructs Amanda to abduct Lynn (Bakar Soomekh), a successful surgeon, to help with his condition.  Upset with her life situation, Lynn is apparently just going through the motions at her job.  Amanda abducts her and leads her to Jigsaw, where she is fitted with an explosive collar designed to detonate if Jigsaw "flatlines".  She is forced to keep Jigsaw alive or risk her own death.<br /><br />The other plot deals with a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen).  Jeff's young son was killed by a drunk driver, and he has been dealing with feelings of revenge.  Captured by Jigsaw and placed in a box, he is released and able to confront those responsible for the death of his son; the lone eyewitness, the leniant judge, and the driver himself.  He has the choice of saving each of these people or letting them die.  Will Jeff choose life or death?  Will he be able to overcome his feelings of rage and save these people, or will they die like so many other of Jigsaw's victims?<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the final 15 minutes.  In this time, all of the questions and twists of the movie are neatly wrapped up.  Watch closely so you don't miss anything.<br /><br />I found this movie to be the best of the "Saw" movies by far.  Tobin Bell does a magnificent job as the maniachal Jigsaw, and the other actors are very good as well.  What sets this movie apart from the first two is its excellent plot.  It will keep you guessing throughout until everything is revealed at the end.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The "Saw" series has become one of the biggest horror movie series in recent memory, and this thrilling and bloody installment maintains the earlier tradition.  The scenes in this movie are much more graphic than in the first two movies, so watch with caution.  This series has become one of my favorites, and "Saw III" keeps the action and blood flowing.</p></body></html>

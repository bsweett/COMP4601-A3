<meta name="summary" content="Eerie prediction of the future?"></head><body><p>Years before Voice-Stress Analyzer, routine polygraphs, and personality profiles, Phillip K. Dick asked the interesting question: Is intent to commit the crime automatic guilt? In Minority Report, Pre-Crime anticipates the offense and stops the crimes before they happen.....or do they??? Would it always, always and without exception, have played out as anticipated? Tom Cruise, framed and put in a position where he'll have an irresistible urge to kill, is told by the PreCog that he can still choose and begins to wonder. A frightening vision of a possible future, and great entertainment. Highly recommend.</p></body></html>

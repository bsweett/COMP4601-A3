<meta name="summary" content="'Batman' is the Best"></head><body><p>The best comic book film to date. Tim Burton's unique visual display will leave you breathless. In a time of crime, Gotham City is in the need of a superhero. Batman, or the Dark Knight, scares criminals and delivers justice to the city. Jack Napier, a man who is cheating with his boss' girlfriend is about to be wasted, but falls into a chemical tank instead. After that, he becomes the Joker (played by the immortal Jack Nicholson) and vows to get revenge on Batman, the man who dropped him into the pool of chemicals. Batman's personal life revolves around Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), an aggressive photographer who is on a mission to discover the roots of the Batman. The man behind the mask is none other than the richest man in Gotham City, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton). He is traumatized by his parents' deaths and vows to get revenge on the man who murdered them. He waited for many years to get his hands on Jack Napier, or the Joker. Boy oh boy, does he get revenge! This movie is filled with comic relief from Jack Nicholson with his art altercation in the museum, 'love that Joker' commercials, and huge revolver. Michael Keaton is perfect as the mysterious, but tough Batman and Kim Basinger is too cool as his love interest. &quot;You wanna get nuts!? Let's get nuts!&quot; Listen for the soundtrack with its great orchestration and Prince songs! This movie is the coolest comic book film ever and will forever remain the best. The closing scene where Batman is on a rooftop of a building looking up at his signal is just the best. I can't stress that enough. This movie is pure immortal.</p></body></html>

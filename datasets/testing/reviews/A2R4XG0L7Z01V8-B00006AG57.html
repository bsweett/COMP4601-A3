<meta name="summary" content="Not a patch on The Mummy series - but still good."></head><body><p>I can officially say, hands down, I loved The Mummy &amp; The Mummy Returns. Of course, they both had Brendan Fraser in them - always helps. You know what I hate? When films get released, and then they do a prequel. That's what annoys about me the Stars Wars or whatever movies. What is the point?!<p>But OK, &quot;The Rock&quot;, otherwise known as Dwayne Johnson, only had a small, what could almost be called a cameo, in The Mummy Returns. He almost appears from nowhere in the movie, just for a couple of small scenes at the start, and a major scene at the end - but I suppose he's all done by CGI at the end. And to capitalise on his role, Stephen Sommers made a prequel, to explain (albeit not very well) how Mathayus the Scorpion King came to be in The Mummy Returns. And I'm still lost.<p>In The Mummy Returns, Mathayus the Scorpion King looks practically evil, and he really does look different in this. Obviously, they had to give him extensions again, just to keep the continuity, and making me relive my days as a professional Barbie doll hairdresser - I was just itching to braid his hair! I think this was set about 10 years before The Mummy Returns too?<p>What's different between The Mummy movies, and this, is the lack of obvious special effects. Whereas in The Mummy movies, you had people being sucked quite literally dry, or being eaten by beatles, which demanded lots of CGI, there's not very much in this. (If you were a cynical person, which I'm so-o definitely not, then you could say it was due to lack of budget, due to the fact that The Rock got his hands on $5.5million for doing this movie) It's back to basic sword/fist fighting for The Rock, and lots of flexing of muscles. He quite literally romances the clothes off Kelly Hu - which wasn't hard, considering she didn't wear that much during the movie - and does all these weird looks, which totally reminded me of Brendan Fraser/Keanu Reeves/a guy I know! Although I desperately wanted to braid his hair, I think it would have more suitable to have short hair - plus he looks cuter with short hair. Can you imagine having to film days of scenes in the desert with hair like that?! I'd be pulling the extensions out there and then!<p>There's been rumours (or maybe it's truth by now, I'm not totally 'up' on movie/actor news - I need to get down on my hands and knees for that kinda info and beg) that Dwayne will be the next Dirty Harry. HUH?! Where did that come from? OK, so we all know Clint Eastwood is on the wrong side of 70 to be doing anymore Dirty Harry movies. (I've said that now, and thinking he's only 68 or something like that), but Dirty Harry is a character. Maybe if you were to say that he was going to be the next Arnie (with those muscles, hell yeah!), but you can't say someone's gonna be the next so-and-so character. A character is meant to be unique, and the actor who plays him will always be known for playing that character. I'm sorry, but if he does decide to do a Dirty Harry movie, a) Clint will have something to say about it, b) I can't see my mum liking it and c) people reviewing it will make endless comparisons.<p>There's heaps of extras on this, as is on both Mummy DVDs. And they literally take years to get through. Most of them aren't that much worthwhile - unless you're interested in breath-by-breath breakdowns of scenes - so all I was interested was the outtakes! But if you're into those kinda extras (which I'm not, I'd be braindead by the end of them - wait a second, am I?) then you'll be in your element with the DVD.<p>This is a good film. Anyone who follows The Rock in his career as a wrestler, will probably notice little titbits like he uses the same moves or does &quot;the stare&quot;, but I'm not. So he's an OK actor, a little bit wooden sometimes, but no one's perfect.</p></body></html>

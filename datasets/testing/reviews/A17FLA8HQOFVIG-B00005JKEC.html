<meta name="summary" content="The wildest, most violent police drama ever!  I loved it!"></head><body><p>There's non-stop action and non-stop violence in this remarkable police story as the big bad narcotics cop, played by Denzel Washington, trains a rookie, played by Ethan Hawke, as to the ways of the street.  Set it Los Angeles, the audience visits the hoods of the gangs as these two cops experience more activity in this one day than most cops experience in a lifetime.  Young Ethan Hawke is shocked over and over again as Denzel not only doesn't play by the book, but turns from simply being streetwise into an exaggerated symbol of the baddest of the bad.  And, even after the film goes to such extremes that reality is completely lost, I was still riveted to my seat as I experienced the wildest, most violent police drama I've ever seen. <p>The plot twists and turns and gradually unveils Denzel as a person to hate, even though there are moments when he can be admired.  I can well understand why he won an academy award for best actor for his thrilling performance. It's a shame that the plot gets a bit hazy during the last 15 minutes of the film, because, until then I had no trouble with it.  But, by that time it doesn't matter.  I was on the roller coaster ride already and there was nothing to do but hold on tight and go along for the ride.  For those who don't mind a huge dose of violence with a story that goes to extremes, this is for you.  It is pure entertainment and will make you forget all your own problems.  I loved it!</p></body></html>

The films do share a director, Martin Scorsese, a source writer, Nicholas Pileggi, and two stars, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  That's where the similarities end.  Both films tackle stories in the criminal milieu and succeed in gripping the audience.  Scorsese manages to make this film a fast-paced experience despite a nearly three hour running time.  He's ably abetted by some snappy editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, gorgeous cinematography by Robert Richardson, and good sense of the era(love the cars and clothes).  Impeccable song choices on Scorsese's part on the soundtrack.  The film is fascinating in how it portrays Las Vegas as a shimmering city which under it's surface is motivated by greed and avarice, which in turn breeds paranoia.  Just ask the eye in the sky.  The first half of the film concerns itself with how some Midwest mobsters infiltrate a Vegas casino.  The second half shows how overreaching causes their downfall.  DeNiro is superb as the oddsmaker who goes on to manage a casino only to be brought down by his own vanity.  Pesci is equally fine as the thug who wants to make Vegas his personal playground.  Probably the best performance in the film belongs to Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife who is at heart a hustler.  This is a difficult part to pull off because her's is essentially a character motivated by pure greed but Stone manages to convey the pathos to make her sympathetic.  I think Scorsese is a victim of his own success because this film was initially given lukewarm response from the critics and public alike.  Fortunately, time has been kind to "Casino".</p></body></html>

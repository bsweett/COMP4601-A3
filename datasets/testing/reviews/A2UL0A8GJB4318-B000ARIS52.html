<meta name="summary" content="A Faithful and Bloody Vision of the Comics"></head><body><p>"Sin City" is a brutal and violent film.  It's a noirish look at a sprawling Metropolis, rampant with corruption, greed, gore and sex.  Just try and resist it.  Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) fuses the blunt brutality with a bold and breathtaking style, propelling the story through three loosely related subplots, connected mainly through their shared theme of the exploration of the dark and feral side of humanity.  "Sin City" grabs you by the throat and rarely loosens its' grip for the next two hours.  If its' a story about a hulking murderer (a mesmirizing Mikey Rourke) on a rampage to avenge the women who showed him a moment of kindness, you're engrossed.  If its' a story of a loner (Clive Owen) looking to help a gang of violent prostitutes from the mob, you're hooked.  If its' a story of a beaten down cop (Bruce Willis) looking to prtect a young woman (Jessica Alba) from a depraved and deformed sexual deviant, you're glued to the screen.  Rodriguez wisely chose to frame the films' visual style around Millers' original drawings and kept Millers' pulpy dialouge intact, which exposes the stories' wounded heart better than any screenwriter could have done.  And even though the film sometimes gets bogged down in its' own visual inventiveness, you will be floored again and again.</p></body></html>

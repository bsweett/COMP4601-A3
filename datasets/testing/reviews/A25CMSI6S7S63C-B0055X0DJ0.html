<meta name="summary" content="FALLEN indeed..Michael Bay 'Transformed' the series into garbage"></head><body><p>The first movie was arguably the one of the best science fiction fantasy  movies of 2007. Everything clicked in the first one. I thought the follow up would be just as good and was I ever wrong.<br />Revenge of the Fallen was just that a character called the Fallen is introduced as Megatron's master & decides now is the time to take over.<br />They missed the target on this one. Too much toilet, bathroom and pointless vulgar language and humor to start off..characters that were just plain stupid...Autobots that had no name and had ghetto humor.Robots that were not even part of the TV series...boy what went wrong here (everything basically)...<br />I cant believe just how bad this was..Fallen is the key word...Fallen from the great heights from the first picture to this lousy sequel.<br />I have no idea what made Michael Bay decide to go for bathroom humor, closeups of a man's fatty butt, a character walking around with his pants down , endless scenes of Megan Fox' boobie cleavage, and a pointless "I love you" subplot that went nowhere at all. I mean really, if you love someone tell them - don't play the battle of wills. Is that how Bay sees relationships - who gives in to who ? Do you wait until someone dies until you say 'I love you I need you' and endless pour your heart out dribble ? Bleck !!<br />This was also overlong running at 2 1/2 hours with endless scenes of the cast running around Egypt looking for signs to find the Matrix of Leadership (which in the cartoon Optimus already has this in his chest) I was waiting for a Transformer Mummy to come out. Take the worst out of the Mummy Series and National Treasure & National Lampoon them with robots and this is what you get..<br />The action was okay - good, but explosions , SPFX , more robots with 'cool' (uncool) dialog do not replace a movie filled with holes, lousy toilet humor and just utter tedium in Egypt....<br />On top of that Rainn Wilsons parents were everything out of a nightmare. What kind of parents are these two ? Who came up with their asinine lines. The mother was just horrible with her dialog. And they kept popping up out of nowhere as did characters - just popping up out of nowhere, half the time I was asking where did this person come from...this made me want to watch the cartoon which at least were classier than this and had a more serious tone than this..<br />As much as I like Transformers & being a fan for over 2 decades this movie was a car wreck..this would make a great Rifftrax or Cinematic Titanic title (for those who are MST3K fans)<br />It really was that bad, and yet, you really want to root for Optimus Prime, you want to like him, but the film wont let you. Or you will like Prime but nothing else.<br />I know Transformers 3 is in the works..I hope Michael Bay & company decide to re-watch the first one to see that formula.<br />For those that did like it and want to own it , the 2 disc is the way to go as it has all the bonus features. Ill be questioning your sanity however :-)</p></body></html>

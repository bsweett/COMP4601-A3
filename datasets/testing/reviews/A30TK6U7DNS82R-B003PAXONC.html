<meta name="summary" content="Weeping Willow"></head><body><p>Give the Oscar to Will Smith, but send his little daughter to acting school!  I thought I had seen the bottom of the Smith barrel when Jaden lit up the screen in last year's homeless but not hopeless saga THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, but I had not reckoned that Will would put little Willow into a movie where vampires smash into limo windows trying to eat her!  Well, better her than another more impressionable child actor I guess.  Is this how Peter and Jane Fonda started out, widenings in their dad's demographic?  The little white boy who arrives in the present day is nothing to write home about however.  They never did explain to me where he'd come from, just told him to keep shuffling his food across his plate, from one end to the other, over and over, in an attempt to suggest some of the post traumatic stress of spending whole days with Alice Braga, niece of veteran Brazilian bombshell Sonia Braga, sadly missed in these days of "the next generation."<br /><br />More importantly the movie delivers plenty of action and suspense, till the last third where it all goes down the drain.  Director Francis Lawrence gets a wrenching performance out of his star, and the designers convincingly show us an apocalyptic and haunted, lonely New York, something Leonard Bernstein might have written symphonies about.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />Hate the emphasis on church in the picture, as the last reels dissolve into a debate between Will Smith and Alice Braga about does God exist or is He just an illusion or worse, out to get us.<br /><br />It was all very well in THE VILLAGE, but why repeat it here in the closing shots of I AM LEGEND.  Why do we have to see that church steeple, is it supposed to make us feel, OK, we're in good hands now?  Even in THE NEW WORLD, when John Smith returns to Jamestown and sees everyone dying of hunger, the church steeple is broken and battered.  Do the vampires of I AM LEGEND respect crucifixes the way vampires in Hammer horror do?  I wonder.  Maybe something of this atavistic belief survives into the present era of post-28 DAYS LATER laterness.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS.  END OF REVIEW.</p></body></html>

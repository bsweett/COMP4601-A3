<meta name="summary" content="dont expect much...The Forgotten is forgettable"></head><body><p>The movie starts out good with Julianne Moore (Boogie Nights, Far From Heaven) who is married to Anthony Edwards (Tv's E.R., Revenge Of The Nerds) and the suffered the loss of their younger son from a plane crash and there were other children on it as well. What she has left is photos and video footage of her son but things start to go weird when she sees that her son is not in a picture. She then starts to breakdown and her doctor...Gary Sinise (The Big Bounce, Snake Eyes) thinks he made up her son in her imagination. Moore meets Dominic West (Rock Star, HBO's The Wire) who's daughter was friends with her son but he swears he doesnt have a daughter but then when he says her name as he stands in her old room he starts to remember, so Moore and West run around the city being chased by guys in nicely pressed suits and the cops as well. The end result was predictable...why, well if you watched the trailer..you knew it was gonna be the green creatures but they take the form of humans. The message was that the beings took the children to observe the parents. The funny thing is that the aliens created a airline....hilarious. Though the only impressive scenes would have to be when the people get sucked up into the sky but otherthen that...it's not even that scary and it's pretty much like I said, predictable. Also starring Linus Roache (Hart's War, Wings Of The Dove) and Alfre Woodard (Crooklyn, Mumford).</p></body></html>

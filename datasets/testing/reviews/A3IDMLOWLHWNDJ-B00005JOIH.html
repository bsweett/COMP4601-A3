<meta name="summary" content=""Munich": Impossible"></head><body><p>"You could be my son..., but you are not. We will continue to do business. But, you are not family."<br /><br />- "Papa" lets Avril know that he is no rolling stone in "Munich"<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's latest is one of his best dramatic films with only "Schindler's List" & "Saving Private Ryan" out distancing it.<br /><br />On September 5, 1972, the XXth Olympiad being held in Munich, West Germany, was interupted by the Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September, taking Israeli Olympians hostage that would result in a hauntingly historic & horrorific tragic outcome.<br /><br />ABC Sportscaster, Jim McKays' words still chill the bone to this day.<br /><br />"I've just gotten the final word. When I was a kid, my father used to say that are greatest hopes & worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears were realized tonight. They have said that there were 11 hostages. 2 killed in their rooms this mor- yesterday morning. 9 killed at the airport tonight. They're all gone."<br /><br />With this tragic & senseless loss, the country of Isreal secretly retaliates with Prime Minister, Golda Meare recruiting a young field operative who Meare has known in the past, named Avril, to put together a five man operation consisting of ex-Mousad soldiers to avenge the deaths of the fallen atheletes of Munich & killing the 11 conspirators that were responsible for their deaths.<br /><br />Avril accepts the mission with unflinching trust in his country & patriotic pride. Working undercover (he signs a contract stating that he doesn't exist), & with the help of his secret ops. commander, Ephraim, Avril is given bank accounts with unlimited financial resources to recruit the best agents for the job & do whatever it takes to get the job done. Traveling to & around Europe, the group slowly starts to gain notice with each death, in the dark confines of the underworld. Avril's underground contact, Louis, is a perfect piece of 70's Euro-trash (even his father, known only as "Papa" would gladly trade him for Avril) & slowly becomes untrustworthy. Soon, the hunters become the hunted. When he slowly starts to lose members of his team, Avril starts to get paranoid, checking his hotel phone, his bed, & his T.V. for explosive devices. Adding to the stress is his family, who he misses dearly.<br /><br />When he does finally return home, he slowly realizes that the country he once believed in, never truly believed in him. Feeling used & betrayed, Avril returns to his family, but, still living the feeling of being trapped in the paranoid crosshairs of terrorism.<br /><br />"Munich" is one of the best films of 2005. Spielberg's direction is top notch (he just may get another Oscar for this). The flashback scenes are a bit gruesome, but, factually acurate.<br /><br />Using the ABC footage of the Olympics and incorporating into the filmed footage gave "Munich" a very spooky edge. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is very much in the style of  70's cinematography (this may get a well deserved Oscar, also).<br /><br />The cast is great. Eric Bana as Avril is his best role to date. Daniel Craig & Geoffrey Rush with the rest of the cast help elevate the film's greatness. I would expect Oscar nods for Bana for best actor & supporting role nods for Rush & Craig.<br /><br />Since I'm a die-hard fan of Spielberg's work I couldn't help, but, notice one drawback.<br /><br />The origin of "Indiana Jones" is legendary. In the late 70's Spielberg & George Lucas were discussing future film projects. Spielberg told Lucas he had always wanted to direct a Bond movie, but, Lucas led Spielberg down a different path with "Raiders Of The Lost Ark". 24 years after the release of "Raiders", & as I watching "Munich" it finally hit me, Spielberg finally got to make his spy movie.<br /><br />Don't believe me?<br /><br />"Munich" has a small group of secret agents sent out to avenge the deaths of the Isreali Olympiads. The 1989 Bond film, "License To Kill" has 007 getting his license to kill revoked as he avenges the attemted death of a close friend.<br /><br />Daniel Craig who is one of the secret ops working for Bana in "Munich" is the new James Bond in the upcoming "Casino Royale".<br /><br />Michael Lonsdale who portrays the dangerous "Papa" in "Munich" also portrayed the even more villanous Hugo Drax in the 1979 Bond film "Moonraker".<br /><br />A lot of the different locales were a bit reminiscent of locales from all sorts of spy movies of the past. "Munich" has a scene where Avril meets Louis, in France, to talk about business in a market with the Eiffel Tower looming in the background. In the 1985 Bond film "A View To A Kill", Bond meets his contact in a restaurant atop the Eifell Tower.<br /><br />So, did Mr. Spielberg direct a dramatic film based on true events?<br /><br />Or, did he direct a dramatic film that happened to be a spy film with a twist (a Jewish James Bond?).<br /><br />Only Steven Spielberg knows for sure.<br /><br />I also highly, highly recommend the 1999 documentary "One Day In September" narrated by Michael Douglas. This Oscar winner is an extremely powerful look at 9/5/72, that chronicals the entire day from start to finish with a look at what would become "Munich". This should not be missed.</p></body></html>

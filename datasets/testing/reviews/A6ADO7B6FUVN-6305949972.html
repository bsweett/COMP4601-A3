Jack seems to have found himself in a brainy predicament as he tries to find reason in what he does and why he exists.  In contemplation Jack stumbles through a deep forest until he discovers an opening in the woods where there are a number of secret doors that lead to all the different holidays.  Jack decides to peek behind the door with the Christmas tree, but a strong wind pulls him in and he falls into a Christmas Town.  Flabbergasted Jack learns about this new and strange holiday as he is amazed about the peculiar traditions of Christmas Town and its leader, Santa Claus.  As Jack returns to Halloweentown he informs the citizens about Christmas Town and its scary leader, which leads him to want to give the people a Halloween styled Christmas, but there seems to be some dangers to this undertaking. <p>Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful story written by Tim Burton where misinterpretations and errors lead to admirable traits such as courage, forgiveness, and love.  However, the story is told in a macabre environment where characteristics are most often forgotten.  Despite the ghoulish atmosphere there is always a need for love and affection, and this punches through the true need for these traits.  Henry Selick does a very good job as he directs this puppet feature as it offers many thoughts and ideas for an audience to ponder, which leaves them with a very good cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

This is what makes American business great.  Why should the smack trade be any different?  One enterprising American decides to take the best of the American business model, and do for heroin what Best Buy did for electronics.  We follow the arc of Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington) dazzling career from small-time hood to capo de tutti capi (di colore), and of his nemesis Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who eventually brings him down.  Yes, this is a "the rise and fall of" film like Carlito's Way, but it's probably the best of the recent offerings in the genre.  Would it be too much to compare it to "Little Caesar"?  I don't think so.<br /><br />All in all, a great guy movie.  Good violence, good action.  There is some female nudity, which is always appreciated by my prurient and adolescent mind.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of it, and it wasn't exploitative or overtly sexual.  But you take what you can get.<br /><br />The standout scene for me is the confrontation between Lucas and Roberts in the time-honored "let's make a deal" scene.  It's really a pleasure to watch two outstanding actors at the top of their game working with great dialogue and direction.</p></body></html>

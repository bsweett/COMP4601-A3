A mix of hard action with a little comedy and some great story twists make "Lucky Slevin" a winner. The story of revenge for a murdered family is not that new, but it is well told with some variations that will keep you seated. Great acting and lines are the key ingredients with good directing, sets, and music thrown in to top it off.<br /><br />I certainly plan to add a copy to my collection. I recommend it to fans of hardcore action movies. This is not suited for the whole family. A man in a friends apartment is mistakenly thought to be a man that owes money to two crime bosses that have been secluded for twenty years since their falling out. Each hires him to kill someone. Superb acting by Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, and Lucy Liu make the movie flow and very entertaining.</p></body></html>

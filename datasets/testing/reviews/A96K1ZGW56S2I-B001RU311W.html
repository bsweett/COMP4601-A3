The film is a pasteurized biopic that begins on Harvey Milk's (Sean Penn's) birthday and his move to San Francisco with his then lover, Scott Smith (James Franco).  Upon arriving in the city, the couple opens a camera shop on Castro Street., which eventually becomes the headquarters for the local gay community as well as Milk's campaign headquarters for the various political offices he would run for.  MILK loosely follows Harvey's life through his political campaigns until after several failed attempts at other offices, he is eventually elected as one of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.  In the movie, upon being elected Milk forms an alliance with fellow Supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin).  White agrees to support Milk's city-wide gay rights ordinance if Milk will support his attempt to keep a psychiatric hospital from opening in the neighborhood he represents.  White is true to his word and is initially supportive of Milk's initiatives, but then Milk betrays White by not supporting him and voting for the establishment of the psychiatric hospital in White's district.  White is dismayed and becomes Milk's adversary and nemesis, voting against everything he supports and voting for everything that he is against.  Milk doesn't seem shocked at all by White's behavior and seems to take a sadistic joy in tormenting him.  It is White who ultimately kills both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Mascone (Victor Garber).  The movie basically ends showing the streets filled with people in a candle-lit march in honor of Milk and Mascone.<br /><br />The best thing about MILK is the acting, particularly the supporting cast.  James Franco does an excellent job portraying Scott Smith, the man who came back to San Francisco with Harvey Milk and was later abandoned by him.  Josh Brolin, portraying Dan White, continues to amaze with his chameleon-like abilities to almost become the characters he portrays.  Also notable is Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, a follower of Milk's who becomes a gay activist leader himself.  There's been a huge hoopla about Sean Penn and his portrayal of Harvey Milk, cumulating in his win for Best Actor at the Oscars.  I don't know what the hoopla is all about.  Penn's performance is passable, but in all honesty it's not great.  In fact, the whole time I was watching MILK in my mind I kept thinking all he was doing was a variation of Sam Dawson from I AM SAM; a performance Penn almost lost his career over.<br /><br />The uberexuberance over Penn's performance also seems to carry over to the movie as a whole because even though MILK is a decent movie, it's not a great movie.  Don't get me wrong. I didn't hate the movie, but I just don't think it's as good as it is being marketed.  MILK follows the same clich&eacute;-ridden pattern that countless other biopics before it set forth.  Everything from the movie's score, to the arc of the story structure, to the overextended final images Milk sees at his death, to the triumphant candle-lit march at the end of the movie are ripped from the playbook of the biopic.  The film displays very little originality and offers nothing new to the medium. Not only that but it glosses over or ignores the more interesting parts of Milk's character and portrays him in a far more positive light than he really was.  Towards the end of the movie, Harvey Milk is talking to Mayor Mascone and the Mayor says, "You know who you sounded like just then? Boss Tweed." The statement is meant as a compliment but shouldn't be.  Boss Tweed was an evil and ruthless man and is someone we should be trying to avoid being like and not emulate.  The same could be said of Harvey Milk and the movie about that version of Harvey Milk would be far more interesting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Achilles Heel."></head><body><p>This lavish war movie took us back 3,200 years ago to discover the truth about the legend of Achilles' heel. The scenes were similar to the primitive fight of our Civil War. The Trojan War was vast and destructive (as was the War Between the States in America); the Colonial Wars were just as bad. At least there was no scalping of prisoners or dead warriors as portrayed in Coyle's SAVAGE WILDERNESS. However, it was not an easy thing to see. Parts of the movie were shot in Mexico; the female vocal was performed by someone named Tanya. Johnny Mathis sang "Remember." The musical director was the marvelous James Horner of TITANTIC fame. War and horror movies depend on the orchestral mood-setting music, and this was no exception. At times, it was spectacular like the sunrise there in Mexico.<br /><br />Based on Homer's THE ILIAD, the saga is updated to 2004 sexual propensities. The nude scenes were not needed in such a movie, only lower the integrity of Homer's classic. The gladiators may have used primitive weapons, such as spears, shields, bows & arrows (they did play dirty using the fire arrows), and I like the nose guards on their helmets. The Trojans were dressed in gray, as they invaded. They loved a spectacle, sometimes fighting without shields. They trampled their own dead in retreat, with some revenge killings. At least, the dead were not left on the field (sand) for the vultures and given a burial pyre where they fell. There were many such death pyres similar to India's tradition. The final was an indoor flame for Hector, the real star of this saga, when the funeral games lasted twelve days.<br /><br />The fleet of ancient boats was quite spectacular. There was pandemonium in the streets (larger scale than in PIRATES OF PENZANCE in which Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline starred) as the fleet approached. There was mass slaughter inside the walls of the city and the fires turned it into a huge funeral pyre. Now, this is the film in which the Rock should have starred. Brad Pitt made a valiant effort. He looked silly, however, in a skirt; his outfits influenced this summer's skimpy styles for women. He looked like a woman with that hair style (bleached blonde to boot). He was a mean (though not lean) fighting machine.<br /><br />Jewelry was abundant on men with earrings and gold ornaments in their long hair. The women (except for Achilles mother) wore lavish jewels -- even the slave girl loved by Achilles (who turned out to be a real princess), was cousin of Hector. The old king, with his ugly teeth, played by Peter O'Toole was humanly portrayed as the father of two handsome sons: Hector married with a blue-eyed son (even Trojan babies suched their thumbs) and Paris who caused all this havoc by stealing the young wife, Helen, who just wanted a man she could grow old with. Her Greek husband was old enough to be her father. Women were used merely as chattal for sex and pro-creation, not much love involved. Achilles slept with women but he loved his male cousin. When the cousin gave his life (dressed as Achilles), a vendetta took place. Hector wasd a fool who thought he'd killed Achilles but revenge caused his death and his body was dragged thtough the desert tied to Achilles' chariot. The old king appealed for his son's body; consequently, we see the Trojan horse and the vermin who escaped to open the gates for a new, massive fleet of Greek warriors to wreck havoc.<br /><br />There were gorgeous horses in the seaside camp on the Trojan Beach. Thank God they freed the horses from the final inferno. The nudity was bad and totally unnecessary. There was a bevy of belly dancers at the feast in Sparta. At Phtia, there was a type of Stonehenge where Achilles practiced sword play with his cousin. His weakness was the sword through his heel as he could not walk, run, or fight back. As he cried before he died, I thought, "So, he was human after all, not just a killing monstrosity." He could find peace only in death.<br /><br />There was plunder as spoils of war. During the twelve-day reprieve, one of the Greek men was shown carving a stone horse with a sharp knife "for my son back home." I guess he got it, as there was a final victory with the Trojans being defeated. It does no good to be sorry 'after the fact.' We're all human, and humans make mistakes -- sometimes fatal. This extra-long movie (music kept it going) showed that even enemies can show respect. When Achilles "frees" the woman who loves him to return to her people (not caring how he hurts her), it parodies the old adage: "You Always Hurt The One You Love."</p></body></html>

I mean just to see Diesel and the great Judy Dench in the same sceen is worth the DVD purchase.  This movie is very well done, the special effects are first rate and the story is fascinating.  I had not seen Pitch Black so i was a bit lost at first, but the movie gets you up to speed quickly.  I didnt go into this movie expecting much, so i was shocked at how well i liked it.  The DVD extras are good, they explain some of the back ground on the characters and locations, which i appreciated, because the movie moves fast.  Highly recommended, especially if your into sci fi, though frankly if you are, you've probably seen this movie a million times, verdad?</p></body></html>

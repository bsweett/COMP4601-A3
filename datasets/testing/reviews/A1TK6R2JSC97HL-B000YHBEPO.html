<meta name="summary" content="Perfect actioner"></head><body><p>Remember when just finding a cool action movie wasn't an impossible mission?  (right before the time of "MI:2".)  Cruise and company are back, and this time with a more worthy follow-up to the first movie.  MI:3 pulls out just the right stops - wowing without going into overkill.  In 3, Cruise plays a grittier yet more aware Ethan Hunt - the thrill-kill Hunt of 2 is history, replaced by a guy who trains new agents and is himself about to tie the knot.  Called into the field for an emergency rescue mission of an IMF agent, Hunt finds himself tangling with her captor - thoroughly evil arms merchant and arch-villain named Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  There are hints that Davian may have some "inside help" at IMF, but he's apparently fearsome in his own right.  The flick gets that point across in the opening shot - set near the end of the story, in which Hunt is in Davian's power, and we realize before we've seen any of the story just how much power he has amassed (will amass) against our heroes.  Flashing back, we follow the story of Hunt's nearly successful-but-doomed rescue of his fellow agent, which is followed by Hunt taking on Davian himself, racing the clock as Davian is about to close an $850 million deal on something called "Rabbit's Foot".<br /><br />"MI:3" offers a heady amount of choreographed fight scenes, car chases and explosions (SUV don't just burn but now get flipped around) but actually excels in its choice of villain - Hoffman barely acts as the evil Davian, but manages to convey his malice and his will to dominate whoever he speaks with.  We see little of what Hoffman actually does, or the breadth of his evil organization, but the script effectively communicates his (and its) fearsome formidability.  Cruise seems a bit tired of the sort of secret-agent contortionism that's been his shtick since the first MI (carried over into "Minority Report") but he's game.  The story also tosses in a larger (but not friendlier) Laurence Fishburne as Hunt's angry boss but also Simon ("Shaun of the Dead") Pegg who steals his scenes as a data-analyst who theorizes on the creation of the "Anti-God" by greedy men.  There are some plot twists that won't surprise anybody, but the flick maintains enough velocity that even the non-surprises are delivered with an effective jolt.  Directed with imaginative flair by JJ Abrams, a man who can't shoot an artless scene.  They say that these movies are getting too expensive to make - if so, the MI franchise goes out on a high note.</p></body></html>

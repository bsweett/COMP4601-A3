<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Campbell playing with his right hand."></head><body><p>Immediately, when you pop in this DVD, it gives you the choice of Widescreen or Full-Screen, Followed by the statement, "Warning: This Film Contains Scenes Which May Be Too Intense For Persons Under The Age Of Seventeen".  Bruce Campbell (NBC serial, "Generations", in 1989) returns four years later in this sequel to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R24K">The Evil Dead</a> (1983).  Ashley brings a girlfriend up to the cabin where he was terrorized before.  Something happens.  Ashley plays the reel to reel player with spell on it.  The evil force is released.  Girl taken through window.  Ashley finds her possessed.  Girl killed and buried.  Then the evil spirit gets a hold of Ashley, temporarily.  He gets back into the yellow car only to find the Dangerous Bridge has been totally destroyed.  The evil spirit won't allow him to leave and chases him back into the cabin and into the cellar.  meanwhile, there are other people who have flown in just to get to the cabin.  The tow truck man knows another road.  Ashley is now fighting with the evil spirit and with his own possessed right hand.  Plays like a "drive-in" film and uses special effects we have seen in "7th Voyage of Sinbad" and "Basket Case"  Studio must have been given him an extra $100 for the budget  this time.<br /> Followed by: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227434">Army of Darkness</a> (1993).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lots of Action"></head><body><p>If you're looking for lots of action and attractive people in the middle of it all, then this movie is for you.  Angelina is, well, Angelina and definately overpowers Pitt and steals the show (not to mention looks good doing it).  While I don't see this movie even getting glanced at when it comes to writing or screenplay, the movie is still entertaining.  Plus there is that whole Brad-Angelina thing going on right now too.</p></body></html>

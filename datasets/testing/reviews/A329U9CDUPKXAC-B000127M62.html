The special effects are terrible, the costumes are terrible, the script is horrible, the acting is awful, the story...what story? So why am I giving this 5 stars? Because everything bad about it was intentional. It's supposed to be corny. That's what people love about these movies. And the battle between Freddy and Jason is pretty cool. I also love the brief appearance by George W. Bush in this movie. An awful president in an awful movie. Love it!</p></body></html>

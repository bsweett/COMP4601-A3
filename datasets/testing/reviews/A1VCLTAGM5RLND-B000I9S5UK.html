This movie doesn't look like the remake of the original movie that was made back in 1976. I was surprised. This movie is fun. I like the characters and the action is well paced. Ethan Hawk's character was the same as his character in "Training Day". Both characters were named Jake and once again he's the good cop fighting the bad cop. Expect lots of twists and betrayal, violence, sex talk in this movie.</p></body></html>

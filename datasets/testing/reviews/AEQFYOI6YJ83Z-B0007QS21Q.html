<meta name="summary" content="An action movie featuring Will Smith--entertaining?  You bet"></head><body><p>Ok, so maybe this movie isn't exactly a "thinking person"'s film (although it does feature more of a conscience than most big-budget action flicks), and maybe it isn't faithful to the original story, and maybe the special effects are rather extraordinary.  Surprised?  After all, we're talking about a summer blockbuster, not an Oscar winner.<br /><br />That aside, "I, Robot" is a pretty enjoyable movie (that's how I judge films, by the way: whether or not they were enjoyable--I don't really care if they make me think too much; I wanna think, I'll open up my physics textbook).<br /><br />Will Smith delivers another superb performance as Spooner, a predictably old-fashioned cop living in--you guessed it--the future.  Robots, you see, have become a household necessity; Spooner doesn't have one because he doesn't trust them.  And this new model coming out...well, something about it just doesn't sit right with our hero.  Especially when one robot is suspected of murder.  If one robot can kill a person...what about these thousands of new robots hitting the market...<br /><br />Asimov's stories were definitely more philisophical than this film; however, standing on its own, "I, Robot" is a great action flick.  Not the deepest movie to come along, and it sure has a lot of male bravado and over-the-top special effects...but if you're still reading this review, that's probably the type of movie you want.  Yeah, it's an underrated flick...which means it's much better than what you've heard.  "I, Robot" is a great movie for cuddling up on the sofa and sharing some buttery popcorn.  Hmmm...I'm getting in the mood to watch it again!</p></body></html>

You will find yourself sympathizing with Williams' character, while worrying that he's rapidly going over the edge.<p>I liked the fact that this movie was not gory, as most Hollywood thrillers tend to be.  <p>Great acting!  You've grown up, &quot;Mork&quot;.  I don't understand why I have not heard more about this movie - it's not the usual slash and burn thriller.  Loved it!</p></body></html>

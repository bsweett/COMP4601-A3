<meta name="summary" content="VAN HELSING is over-the-top thrill ride"></head><body><p>After the huge success of his THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS, writer/director Stephen Sommers was given the green light to tackle some of Universal Studios' prime horror creations.  I refer, of course, to Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man, who all raised thrills and chills in the classic films of the 30's and 40's.  The result is an over-the-top thrill ride that will please some, while making others roll their eyes at some of the absurdities that abound.<br />The movie basically uses Bram Stoker's classic vampire-hunter, Van Helsing, as its hero.  However, instead of the elderly professor of the book and previous films, he is a younger, mysterious and dynamic version played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine of the X-MEN films).  Aided by a lovely gypsy (Kate Beckinsale) and his ingenious assistant, Carl (David Wenham), Van Helsing must foil the plans of the evil Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) to populate Transylvania with new-born vampires.  Complicating matters are the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) and the Wolf Man (Will Kemp and major CGI effects).  Along the way, Van Helsing learns some vital clues to the secret behind his dark past.<br />For the most part, the acting ranges from solid to almost laughable.  Hugh Jackman is spot-on as the title character, perfectly embodying the vampire-hunter's drive to defeat his foes. Unfortunately, the character is almost completely grim throughout the film, making him hard to relate to at times.  Much better in that regard is David Wenham's Carl.  Coming off as a monkish version of "Q" in the James Bond films, Wendam easily gets his share of the film's laughs.  He is almost matched by Kevin J. O'Connor's Igor, who helps out Dracula.  Despite being buried in gobs of make-up, Shuler Hensley makes for a decent and sympathetic Frankenstein's Monster.  On the other hand, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula and Kate Beckinsale's Anna seem to vie for the title of "most over-wrought accent", with Roxburgh getting the nod here.  However, Beckinsale looks great as a gypsy and she handles most of the physical stuff pretty well.  Will Kemp's performance is non-existent as most of it is done by his CGI alter-ego.<br />The CGI effects and stunts are top-notch, and you almost can feel worn-out by the high energy of the production.  In fact, that can be said to be this film's main flaw.  The plot is simply an excuse to zip from one action scene to the next.  Also, unlike the MUMMY films, there is no "twinkle in the eye" or sense of joy in this flick.  As a result, one finds it very hard to relate to any of these characters.<br />Still, this is not a bad film.  If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and accept the film for the amusement ride it is, it is definitely worth your time.</p></body></html>

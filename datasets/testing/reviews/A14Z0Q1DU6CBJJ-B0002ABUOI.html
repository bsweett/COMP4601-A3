<meta name="summary" content="DAWN OF THE DEAD scares and entertains"></head><body><p>Finally!! A Director (Zach Snyder) covered all his bases and put together a fantastic movie that will be remembered for years to come.<br /><br />The opening sequence to DAWN OF THE DEAD is so so good. From the subtle hints of empending doom like the nurse mentioning the man who was taken to I.C.U. from a bite, or the special report coming on the television as our two stars unwittingly take a shower and prepare for bed.<br /><br />When morning comes... you as a viewer feel the dread in the air. We KNOW what the actors DO NOT and it works perfectly. The intense scene that follows, the zombie isn't slow, moaning and dim-witted and the car as ANA (Sarah Polley) drives through her neighborhood, watching the turmoil unfold as the camera zooms higher and higher to show that the world is being consumed by the deadly virus.<br /><br />The movie works on all levels. Screenplay is sharp. Dialogue is crisp. Acting is top notch. The tension has payoff. There is dark humor and a great finale that carries on through the credits.<br /><br />I don't get scared by movies anymore. I've seen too many. Yet, Dawn of the Dead worked, and worked WELL!! If you like this sort of thing... get it! You won't be disappointed!</p></body></html>

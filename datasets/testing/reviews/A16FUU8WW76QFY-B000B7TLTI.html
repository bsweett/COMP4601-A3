The combination of director Brad Bird and Pixar have created a fun excursion into the world of superheroes, complete with relevant modern-day tribulations thrown in for good measure.  Every time other film production companies feel like they are catching up to Pixar, the renowned CG animators make a great leap forward with something like "Incredibles", leaving the competition in the dust again.<br /><br />"Incredibles" is about superheroes who have lost their relevance in a world of lawsuits and spoiled wannabes.  Our heroes been forced into mundane lives of drudgery.  The two children have inferiority complexes because they cannot show their superpowers, and dad (Mr. Incredible) has to put up with a brainless, narrow minded boss at the insurance agency.  Mom (Elastigirl) spends her life ironing and dealing with dad's frustrations at not being able to assist the helpless!  Ah, but evil still lurks in the hearts of men!  A dastardly force is about to be unleashed from an uncharted island, and Mr. Incredible and his super family are their to save the world in the nick of time!<br /><br />The direct-to-digital transfer is a marvel to behold.  Even on my 10-year old Toshiba 36" CRT, the picture simply leaped off the screen.  It is clear to see just how far the CG animation envelope has been pushed beyond even the impressive work Pixar did in "Finding Nemo".  In point of fact, what really separates Pixar from the pack is the quality of the storytelling in their films.  One really cares about the characters and the journey they go through to reach the climactic battle with the giant robot at the end of the film.  There is real emotion here, things that anyone from 4 to 104 can relate to.<br /><br />5 big stars for Pixar hitting the nail on the head again with "The Incredibles"!</p></body></html>

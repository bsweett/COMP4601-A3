The pace is quick, the general premise interesting, and the actors excellent, but in the end the movie is just good, not great.<br /><br />The main character is Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter working for the United Nations, who lived a long time in Motobo. One day, Silvia returns to the interpreters' booth in order collect some things she forgot, and by chance hears some conspirators whispering in Ku (the language of Motobo) about a plan to kill Zuwanie. Unfortunately for Silvia, they see her, but she manages to escape. The following day, Silvia goes to the police to tell them what she heard. The problem is, they are not totally sure they believe her. And as events develop, one of the officers in charge of protecting visiting dignitaries, a very troubled Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), begins to suspects that Silvia has more reasons that anyone else to kill Zuwabi. In the end, it is difficult to know who is lying, and why.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat surprising, but it feels a little contrived. Also, there are hints throughout the movie of an emotional connections of sorts forming between Silvia and Tobin, but nothings gets round to happening, and some spectators will end up saying aloud "Is that all?" at the end of the movie. At least, that is what happened to me.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that, I would like to point that I specially enjoyed two of the extra features included in the dvd, "The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations" and "A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters". My favorite was the first one, in which the director and part of the crew talk about the process of gaining permission to shoot in the building, and what it meant for them to get it, turning "The interpreter" into the first film to be shot inside the United Nations Headquarters. That feature also shows extra shoots of the building, the General Assembly and the room where the public sessions of the Security Council are held (depending on the issue, there are also private meetings not open to the public).<br /><br />On the whole, and despite the excellent acting, I think that this movie was no more than adequate. Truth to be told, the thing I'll probably remember more about "The interpreter" is its set, that is, the United Nations' building. But... I believe that something is wrong with a film when the most noteworthy feature is the setting.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

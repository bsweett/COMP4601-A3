<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Best Dramas Ever Filmed!"></head><body><p>I first saw this wonderful movie after rushing out to buy the novel to read before the movie finally came out later in the summer. I was just a teenager still in high school, but immediately loved the movie, which I  have seen countless times since. Gregory Peck is probably the single  greatest reason for the movie's smashing success, although the entire cast  does a terrific job in bringing this momentous story to the screen.  In  today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to how explosive,  provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape was in the early  1960s when the movie hit the screens. Yet despite the sizzling if subdued  sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the movie, it quickly  became the movie of the year, winning Peck the Oscar for his incredible  portrayal of rural southern lawyer Atticus Finch. <p>No doubt it is the  character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's  enduring popularity. Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so  favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American  novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat  befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young  children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the  Depression. As daughter Scout remembers, there was little that Atticus  couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And, as played by Gregory Peck,  this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern  American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold. Of course,  the other characters are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described,  and the way in which the importance and relevance of the mockingbird  parable is sown into the web of the story at a number of different levels  with a number of different characters is also one of the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book. <p>Whether considering Tom Robinson,  Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better  understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are  intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric  of a particular time and place. Indeed, we watch with growing affection as  Atticus increasingly relies and depends on their black governess, and are  amazed by the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well. On  the other hand, we watch as Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat people of  color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment of human  beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any particular  place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the characters  of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in &quot;To Kill A  Mockingbird&quot;, that one can only hope it continues to be widely seen  and appreciated as a modern American classic.</p></body></html>

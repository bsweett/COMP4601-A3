There is no denying that Yimou has a distinctively strong visual style.  That said, if it's all style and no substance, so what?  "Hero" is blessed with a good narrative.  Essentially, the theme of the film is what defines a hero.  The answers that Yimou offers are both surprising and enlightening.  Strong cast that includes Jet Li and Ziyi Zhang.  Essential viewing.</p></body></html>

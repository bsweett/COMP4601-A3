However her performance alone can not raise this movie to 5 stars.  The movie takes place with Thatcher at the end of her life suffering dementia and hallucinations and through flashbacks we learn her life story.  I found the pace to be slow, and the whole thing a bit sad.  Whether you like her policies or not, Thatcher was an incredibly strong woman and politician and I wish the story had focused more on that.  Starting everyone from the saddest point of her life dampened my enthusiasm for the movie.</p></body></html>

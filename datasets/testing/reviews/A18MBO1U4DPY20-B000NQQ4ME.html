One of the few things that stand out in this film is how good the acting is.The characters seem totally oblivious to the camera.The action has its own applauding pace, the characters have their own shortcomings in execution of the most direst of straits of moves while the weather, sun and the moon have their own influence.This movie took me by surprise.The brutality might seem exaggerated but we're men and WE LIKE THIS.I loved the two major villains of the film.Their eyes convey no respite and sometimes the chase scenes seem to actually make you want not to blink.Yes,there is blood but not to the extent to make it seem obscene/overdone. What I absolutely loved about the film is the taunt of one of the villains (Clue - "Almost") Enough said. You will like this film if you want to get your money's worth. This does figure among the top ten movies I saw in 2006 and believe me, I've seen my fair share. A huge cheer of respect for Mel Gibson. Two words, WHAT NEXT</p></body></html>

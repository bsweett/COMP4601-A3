<meta name="summary" content="Well it had potential"></head><body><p>Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been in a rut; everything has to be bigger and louder and basic storytelling has gone out the window. But I'm not gonna totally knock Hollywood they do sometimes get it right. It's just they don't produce the movies they once did. I hoped I Am Legend would be one of the few that worked well, but when all was said and done Hollywood dropped the ball again. I Am Legend had potential to be a really chilling movie, but it never reaches that level.<br /><br />First up I have to mention Will Smith who plays Robert Neville; it's pretty much a one man show and more than half the movie is just Will Smith and his dog. I'll give major credit to Smith who really does a great job at carrying the movie. In general the movies Will Smith does really don't appeal to me, but he is a fantastic actor and does one hell of a job here.<br /><br />I Am Legend is based off the Richard Matheson novel and the screenplay was written by Mark Protosevich & Akiva Goldsman and it's never really interesting. It's not easy to write a screenplay and even harder when you have pretty much one character through a majority of the movie. The concept of the movie is excellent, but their screenplay just doesn't really work. It's not terrible by any means, just isn't all that good. But with the right director it could have possibly worked.<br /><br />Francis Lawrence steps into the director's chair and fails at brining any tension or adventure. The pacing often lacks and he never really gets much going and the action scenes come out weak. Seeing the deserted Manhattan streets is sort creepy as a New Yorker and seeing that makes for a semi chilling moment, but is never as creepy as it could have been. But after a while those shots become tiresome. I never felt that whole end of the world vibe; one of the most chilling scenes in recent memory was the deserted London streets in 28 Days Later, but here with I Am Legend you never get that chilling vibe.<br /><br />The screenplay was flawed, but with the right director I think the movie could have worked. I just never felt any tension, the deserted Manhattan streets are never as chilling as it should have been and the action scenes fail at brining much excitement. The ending was very anti-climatic. What could have been a powerful scene feels rushed and just falls flat.<br /><br />The biggest downfall of the movie is the CGI; first off I really don't like CGI, but depending on the movie I can tolerate it. With a 150-million dollar budget one would think the F/X would come out good, but nope it's terrible and really brings the movie down. I've seen movies done on a much lower budget that ranges from 2-5-million with CGI and it looks on par with this. I've seen movies done under a million that have far better F/X. With the budget I Am Legend had there is no excuse for such shoddy F/X.<br /><br />I Am Legend is just too Hollywood stylized; in some ways it's better than a lot of what's out there. While this does have action scenes it's not done as much as I thought it would be. I expected mindless action scene over and over again and it wasn't. So that's a good thing, but action or not it's too stylized. A movie like this needs more of a gritty look. Again there was potential here, but when all is said and done I Am Legend just lacks in tension and excitement.<br /><br />If you are into big time Hollywood productions odds are I Am Legend will get the job done and you'll enjoy the movie, but for the rest of us we'll mostly be bored. I haven't seen The Omega Man, which is based off the Matheson novel and I Am Legend follows that movie, but I have seen The Last Man on Earth, which is also based off the Matheson novel. My opinion skip this one and check out The Last Man on Earth, while flawed it's far better than this. But again for those who enjoy Hollywood productions you'll probably like this, but the rest will be bored at another Hollywood mishap.</p></body></html>

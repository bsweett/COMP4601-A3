<meta name="summary" content="Heinlein Is Hard to FIlm (UMD Mini for PSP)"></head><body><p>This movie takes one of Robert A. Heinlein's books and attempts to translate it into film. This film follows the general precept of the book that mankind is in a war with a race of insect-like creatures that have various castes. As with the book the movie does not attempt to resolve the war, but does intend on providing some hope.<br /><br />Heinlein has been called the Dean of Science Fiction. Because of his phenomenal success he was able to write beyond the boundaries of many of his contemporaries to express his viewpoints regarding society. The novel on which this movie was based was laced with several political viewpoints as well as predicting a future for the military that we can be seen as the trend of our military today.<br /><br />When Heinlein wrote this novel in 1959 he tried to convey the simple concept that citizenship in the most free society on earth was taken for granted.  Heinlein thought that perhaps one way of changing the definition of citizenship was to require that it be earned. Thus Heinlein advocated that all citizens should give two years of public service. Some people have narrowly construed this service to mean military service, but in his book Heinlein clearly stated that the service was governmental service and did not specify the type of service. In any case, earning the right to vote was central to the book. That concept was minimally discussed in the movie in favor or making an action-packed military monster movie.<br /><br />Heinlein's future military was focused on the individual, with incredible weapons and training. Interestingly, our military continues to rely on ever-better weaponry with the individual soldier wielding ever more power and hopefully having better training as time passes. Again, the movie threw out this concept in order to make the movie move faster with multiple rescue scenarios. While Heinlein's bugs were not sympathetic, by having the bugs callously destroy a chunk of Earth real estate enables the audience to loathe them even more.<br /><br />After throwing out two of Heinlein's key concepts, the result is a B science fiction movie with lots of gore and action. However, even with traditional science fiction themes, I liked this movie. The acting is only fair, much of the movie is "golly gee whiz" and salute the flag, and the plot has more holes than cheesecloth, and for all that it is a fun and exciting movie that I have watched at least four or five times. Some of the scenes are dramatic and scary, such as when the flying bugs attack and when the ground bugs spear people. The scenes with the tanker bugs are incredible.  I have spent too much time trying to figure out how their burning dissolving fluid works.<br /><br />There are places in the movie that are likely implausible, and yet, maybe not. When Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) pilots a huge spaceship out of dock she does it by eye and barely keeps from damaging the ship and the dock. Clearly not standard operating procedure and had the ship been damaged she would have been fried (or should have) by her boss. However, she is cocky and overconfident and takes responsibility and authority, all traits that we try to cultivate in our military within the framework of standard military discipline. So perhaps parts are a bit far-fetched, but maybe not too far-fetched.<br /><br />One aspect that I think Heinlein would have approved is the brutality of military training. People broke bones and suffered pain, just as they would in actual combat, though situations that cause death are clearly unacceptable. While the scenes of injury in training are initially shocking, medical technology in this future has the capability of repairing such injuries and being capable of handling the shock of seeing those injuries or withstanding them could give a soldier a combat advantage in the field; gruesome, but effective scenes.<br /><br />The film was intended to be shocking, and it succeeds. This movie is not for children. I would not let anyone under the age of 14 watch this movie, even though there are a few video games with similar levels of violence. I think the movie is too violent for even young teenagers, and it deserves its "R" rating. There are a few scenes involving nudity and one involving sex that again may be shocking, but given the equality of men and women in this army of the future, the scenes make sense.<br /><br />I have read the book and I still like the movie. This movie is not going to win any awards, but who cares? I think this is a great bowl of popcorn movie action film where you can relieve some stress as thousands of bugs are gruesomely terminated. There are times when you really want to root for the human race, and this one allows you to do so without guilt.</p></body></html>

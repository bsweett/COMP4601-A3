<meta name="summary" content="For a Good Time, Call Archie."></head><body><p>And that, in a nutshell, is what is great and not so great about "Watchmen".  I must apologize for being esoteric, but if I explain it I would be guilty of spoilers.  It should suffice to say that said "Archie" scene was both a defining moment of this films wonderful human elements and gratuitous to the point of being tedious.  That said, one scene, or 6 or 7 for that matter, were not enough to spoil my enjoyment of a film by a guy who has made one of my least favorite films (300).  If you haven't realized by now, this is never an easy film, yet I was surprisingly up to the challenge.  Before I really start to ramble on, I'd better chop this up a little.<br /><br />REDEMPTION FOR ZACK SNYDER?<br />It sure sounds like I'm picking a fight (who, ME?) but I have my reasons.  For better or worse, Zack has made a name for himself by bringing comic books to life on screen (excuse me, "Graphic Novels" puh-lease!).  His first big hit "Sin City" was pretty successful and highly regarded.  I'll be damned if I'll ever get to see it.  It's been on my list for years.  Yet, I'll take the word of those who liked it.  Next was "300".  What can I say that my "300" review didn't; it was a silly cartoon based on one of the greatest last stands in human history.  Though faithful to the equally goofy comic... ...excuse me; GRAPHIC NOVEL (yeesh!) I thought it was highly overrated and translated poorly to the cinema.  So, knowing he directed "Watchmen" was not working as an endorsement for me.  In fact, I had great trepidation that this would be another nutty "300" with cartoon violence and gratuitous sex.  I was right.<br /><br />I'M NOT A FAN OF NOIR COMIC BOOKS (or "Graphic Novels")<br />I almost bought this book.  But as I leafed through it at the book store, I decided I would pass on its meager 1940's style graphics and tiny word bubbles.  This was all done for a great purpose that the comic geeks could tell you about, but it wasn't pulling me in.  I'm not a big fan of the trend towards dark comics with dystopian alternate realities either.  I don't mind troubled characters but I want them to succeed on some level and at least live in a normal, screwed up world.  A world on the brink of self destruction is a bit too heavy for me. Besides, I don't like clouding my judgment of a film by reading the book first.  I work in reverse order.  This book has all the things I don't want in a comic and the film followed suit.<br /><br />GRATUITOUS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH A WORD<br />There was a point in this movie when I leaned over to my friend (yes, I have a couple) and whispered; "is this what they mean by "blue movie"?".  My friend chuckled.  You see, the god-like Dr. Manhattan, who always glows in a blue light, was getting it on with the "Silk Specter".  So, they were having sex in blue light.  Ok, it's not so funny when you read it, but I thought it was a good one.  Anyway, like 300, sex scenes seem to be sprinkled in just for kicks.  Now I'm not against sex in general, but as the saying goes; been there, done that.  Though sex actually does enhance some moments of the film (the "Archie" scene I alluded to earlier) it really does nothing to move the plot along.  In fact the "Archie" scene was more of a comedic moment than the steamy hot moment it was depicted to be.  I guess super heroes with ED require different cures.  It's funny what can float your boat (you'll just have to see it).  Regardless, this might have been the only time in the film where I got a little bored (crazy, I know).  This doesn't sound so bad until you see Dr. Manhattan getting all up in your face with his schlong for extended periods.  I'm not particularly prudish about full frontal nudity when handled properly, but this was a bit much.  This blue god-man was every man's worst locker room nightmare; the naked guy who acts like he's dressed.  You know the one.  He walks around without a towel and insists on carrying on conversations with his wanker hanging in your face.  You can tolerate this for a minute or two, but he insists on walking around like this for 20 minutes or so.  That's how Dr. Manhattan comes across in this movie.  I don't want to get into his god-like mindset (what god needs cloths?), I just don't need to see him, or a woman for that matter, standing there naked ALL THE TIME!  I'm a big believer in sexual teasing in films.  There's nothing more arousing than that.<br /> I haven't even touched on the violence in this film.  Unlike "300" with its CG blood spraying everywhere, "Watchmen" holds back a little more.  Yet there is no shortage of dismemberment, face-smashing, bone-popping brutality.  Though the action is limited, I thought it was well staged and not nearly as posed as in "300".  I kind of enjoyed that part of it.  So, in review; Sex and nudity is too much.  Bone crushing brutal violence is OK.  As twisted as that sounds it was all gratuitous to the nth degree.<br /><br />IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS<br />I wouldn't say "Watchmen" has a particularly great or original story.  What makes it original are its characters.  You've got a guy who's a lot like Batman on the surface, yet nothing like Batman in demeanor.  You've got a hero who is only a hero based on which side he's on.  Some call these types "anti-heroes".  I call them A-holes.  You've got slutty vulnerable women heroes who kick butt; very cool.  You've got a guy who is nothing like Batman on the surface, but has an even deeper, demented lack of compromise when it comes to justice.  You've got the genius hero trying to save humanity with big swings and you've got the Goddish Dr. Manhattan who muddies the waters with his fading touch with humanity.  What you end up with is a bunch of gifted people with all their warts and flaws trying, for the most part, to do the right things even if it kills us.  As far as superheroes go, they mostly appear to be highly skilled fighters with mysterious enhanced strength or agility.  Even though you never truly understand how most of the characters came by there special abilities, it never really is that important to know with the exception of Dr. Manhattan.  The biggest bummer of them all is that my favorite character bites the big one in the end.  The great thing is I cared.<br /><br />WHO'S WATCHING THE WATCHMEN?  I AM!!<br />It's no big surprise then that I loved this movie.  Despite never having read the book, despite my disdain for the genre and Zack Snyder, despite what I felt was overwrought sexuality (crazy, I know) and despite a story that wasn't great, I loved this movie.  I was entertained for almost the entire 3+ hours.  For this I can thank the perfectly cast actors (check IMDB for details) portraying incredible characters that drip with humanity (Dr. Manhattan not withstanding).  The story serves well enough as a scaffold for these character to interact and react in.  I also have to give proper respect to Zack Snyder for actually not overdoing MOST of this film.  In fact, most of it was just plain stunning to look at.  I don't care if the book's author was cheesed off about this production.  I don't care if it was true to source material or not (as I haven't read it).  As a Superhero movie "Watchmen" just bumped down a bunch of other Super-movies on my list, including "Dark Knight".  Highly recommended for those seeking great, original characters presented in an entertaining way.<br /><br />Action......4 stars<br />Acting/Characters......6 Stars<br />Visuals......4.5 stars<br />Gratuities....3.5  stars<br />Average......4.5 stars</p></body></html>

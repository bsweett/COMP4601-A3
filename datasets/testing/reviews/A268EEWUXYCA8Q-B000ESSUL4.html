Terrence Malick has been in the industry for over 30 years and only has about 5 pictures under his name.  He takes time and creates the film he wants.<br /><br />The New World is not a great "movie" in the traditional sense.  There are voice overs, when there actually is dialogue it is quick and to the point.  When there's action, it is also quick, ruthless and used to give across a point, not for the actual action itself.  What Malick does well is create a portrait, a painting of that time period and what was happening.  By paring down the story of Pocahontas (though she is never called that in the movie nor is called anything until she receives the name Rebecca), Malick shows us not the highly stylized version or the romantic version as it has come to be known.  The movie is about her journey, her discovery and eventually her ending.<br /><br />The plot is very elusive.  There really isn't one in the traditional sense; the plot is hidden behind subtle pieces of dialogue, images on the screen.  Someone not paying attention might get confused as to what's going on (I say this because the people sitting behind me were giving a running commentary the entire movie "What's going on?" "What just happened?" etc).  Malick also takes into account that you know the story, at least in essence, of Pocahontas.<br /><br />But it is also about the quality of nature and Malick reminds us how beautiful the land is.  Portions of the movie stars just nature with maybe a voice over explaining their feelings, but at the same time it reflects the cinematography.  Its beautiful to watch.  For those interested in plot heavy movies, look elsewhere.  I guarantee you will not like this film.  Those looking for a minimalist tale, one that is very light on plot but heavy on subtleties and the nuance of the camera, then this is a film for you.<br /><br />Boring in spots, breathtaking in others, The New World is a mishmash of the incredible and the mundane.</p></body></html>

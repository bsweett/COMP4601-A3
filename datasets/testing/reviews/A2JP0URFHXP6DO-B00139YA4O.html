<meta name="summary" content="A CAPTIVATING TV SHOW"></head><body><p>To me, "Lost" is a watershed moment in TV history.  When I first saw the promos for the show back last season I wondered how the heck are they going to make a drama on people crashing on an island.  Gilligan's Island aside, this is not a screwball comedy nor is it the 1960's anymore.  I hazzard to say that TV audiences are more sophisticated today althouth shows like "Fear Factor" may belie that conjecture.  I'd not watched many dramas in recent years (not counting fantastic shows like Buffy & The X-files) as I grew weary of the ER-type dramas that go on and on with nothing ever really happening.<br /><br />Lost only goes to prove what can be done with talened writers, directors,and for the most part, no-name actors.  The realy trick behind Lost was giving us one major plot line and then branching that out in dozens of directions.  Suddenly by season's end you realized there was still so much more we did not know about the characters and the island itself.  The skillful blend of drama, mystery, action, fantasy, and romance is something never seen in televison. in my opinion.  The characters are, seemingly, just everyday people and react the way that the average person would in this situation.  They all have their own strenghts and weaknesses...and secrets.<br /><br />It's is these character which are as captivating as the main story itself.  The writers did a brilliant job by devoting an episode or two to each of the main chracters and fleshing out their backgroungs...not entirely...but just enough to make viewers want more.  We see Jack Shepard (Matthew Fox) as a surgeon who seems to have it all in life but is unhappy and searching for something more...Kate (Evangeline Lilly) the flight's mysterious prisoner and yes, killer...Sawyer (Josh Holloway) the cocky, sarcastic, greedy rogue whose on his own lifelong quest for revenge and absolution...Hurly (Jorge Garcia) the rotund, carefree lottery winner plagued by a nefarious spate of bad luck...<br /><br />And then there is John Locke.  Terry O'Quinn had been one of my favorite character actors for years..from his roles in "The Stepfather" to playing Howard Hughes in "The Rocketeer" to his stints in the X-Files and "Millennium", I have never seen this man give anything other than a brilliant performance and he is the key to this show.  His almost spiritual connection with nature and his miraculous recovery from paralyzation make him the most intriguing character in the show.  I've a feeling that we're going to learn much more about Locke and it may not all be good.<br /><br />I'd be remiss not to mention the character of Sayid (Naveen Andrews) playing a former Iraqi soldier.  I love the character but am curious why they chose and actor of Indian heritage rather than Arabic...The mysteries of the island abound...the lost aircraft and ships...the strange creatures and sounds, the french woman, the distress signals, etc...it's a dizzying array of plot-twits which the writers and directors have skillfully juggled.<br /><br />In this wasteland of brainless reality TV, "Lost" was like a beacon of light that brought viewers back to TV for a quality show.  Hopefully its success will cause other networks to stand up and take notice at just how good a show can be if you work at it and not take the cheap way out with low-rent reality TV.  I cannot wait until the new season begins.  This is the BEST show on TV today!</p></body></html>

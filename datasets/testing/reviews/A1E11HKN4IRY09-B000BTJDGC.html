<meta name="summary" content="The courtroom drama of Emily Rose."></head><body><p>The trailer of this flick is misleading.<br /><br />A somewhat decent courtroom drama, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is not a horror movie as the advertising would have you believe.  It's an okay put together study of was she/wasn't she possesed melodrama that doesn't fully answer that question, but that's about it.  The suspense in this film is stillborn and the chills are fleeting.  When first released the marketing campaign led the wary viewer to the conclusion that they would be subject to a new fangled 'EXORCISM' movie with a dark and dreary plot regarding a new, fresh take on demonic possesion.  Instead this motion picture is more of a character study for LAURA LINNEY's lawyer character, who strugles with the assumption that her  client (the exorcising priest, TOM WILKINSON) is or isn't witnessing the supernatual.  All of the supernatural events are witnessed in quick flashbacks which were all shown in the previews and aren't too unsettling at that.  I was waiting for some huge plot twist at the end which never came and made the proceedings even more laborious.  Given the subject matter this could've been creepier and better on a whole, instead the viewer is given the kind of movie typical of the SCI-FI channel sans any action or twisted humor.  A well made but run of the mill drama.</p></body></html>

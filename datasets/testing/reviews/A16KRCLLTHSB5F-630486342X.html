There's nothing of the guilty pleasure about it; it's more than just a blood-drenched gangster film (although, admitedly, it is that).<br /><br />Tarentino's mastery of dialogue is obvious from the first scene. While the reccurence of sudden, violent death might be the thing which lingers in the mind, it's important to realize that the bulk of the movie's substance consists of meandering, basically pointless conversations between the main characters. A sense of their humanity is built surpassing even the characters in the Godfather; they're human beings first, second and third, and criminals only incidentally. The round-table conversation about song lyrics and the ethics of tipping; the extended one-upsmanship between Vick Vega and 'Nice Guy Eddie;' Keitel's fatherly tutoring; everything is brilliant. Some classic playwrights can't write this believably.<p>Second, the violence, while not central, is extremely effective. The curt way in which death occurs emphasizes the difference between this genere and the martial arts/action genere showcased in the later 'Kill Bill;' in this world, no matter how cool you may be, or how tough, or how well-developed your character, all it takes is one gunshot, and it's over. The rapid-fire executions near the end have a resonance which the ten-hour death scenes replete with speeches in, say, Metal Gear Solid, don't even approach.<p>This move is an absolute classic, Tarentino's best second to Kill Bill, and, more than enjoyable, something of real skill and merit.</p></body></html>

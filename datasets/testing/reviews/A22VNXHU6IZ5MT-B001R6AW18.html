<meta name="summary" content="It's the original and still the best!!!  A top-notch reissue job from the folks at Warner Bros!!!"></head><body><p>The folks at Warner Bros. Home Video really did a top notch job with their "King Kong" Two Disc Special Edition DVD!!! Great remastering job of an all time movie classic!!! Move over Peter Jackson,the 1933 classic black and white original still reigns supreme!!! Lots of great DVD extras that you'll go "ape" over!!! There is also a single disc movie-only version available,but the Two Disc Special Edition is still the way to go!!! AN ALL-TIME CLASSIC!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+</p></body></html>

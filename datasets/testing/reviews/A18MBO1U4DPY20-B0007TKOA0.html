<meta name="summary" content="The Best Review Of This Movie Yet"></head><body><p>If you liked the honesty of "Adaptation", the documentary style subtlety of "The Squid And The Whale" , the silent grace of "Mrs. Henderson Presents"; and if you disliked the pretence of "Lost In Transalation" but understood the gravity of "Garden State" despite it's sweet flaws yet disliked the consciousness of "Eternal Sunshine of the fabricated mind" , YOU WILL LIKE SIDEWAYS<br /><br />Paul Giamatti (whatshisname) is a great actor. He might look as innocous as they come with his balding feature but he manages to actually become the soul of character,that of a writer who is helplessly in love with wine and the fading memory of his ex-wife, quite perfectly. Along with a friend, he manages to stunt my expectations and come out with a film that I wasnt expecting one bit. This film has excitement,that of a kind of it's own, this film is not funny, not one bit but yet it is meant for a patient viewer who's been yearning to watch a film of a "Certain" kind for a long time.<br /><br />Sideways will entertain you if you read the first para rather well. I might have failed in nailing the point and convincing you but atleast you know how I feel.<br /><br />(Please See or)PS:<br /><br />You might call me stupid for naming my review so but I got you to read it in this heap of 519 reviews, out of which I read just one before watching Sideways.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />In the scene where Paul goes to the loo and curses himself for not being able to kiss the girl behind the door, I saw myself. I saw and I relate to that scared bald man who's too scared of the world they live. It perfectly,without preaching, managed to clinch the silent tenacity of such individuals irrespective of the result of the character's actions.</p></body></html>

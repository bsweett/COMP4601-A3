<meta name="summary" content="The best Blu-ray edition of a Tarantino-related movie so far - definitely a buy"></head><body><p>What more is there to say about what, in my view, is a brilliant, unashamed exploitation zombie movie that's already a classic? Yes, I know, the Grindhouse double-feature didn't too so well in the theaters but maybe the public wasn't yet ready for such advance cinematographic material. Maybe it still isn't and maybe it will never be. I know that I will never get myself tired of anything Tarantino or Tarantino-related and a movie where Tarantino, if fact plays a part and it's supposed to be the B-movie to Quentin's 'Death Proof' is a Tarantino movie to me (sorry, Robert Rodriguez). Just for the fun of name-dropping, did you know that Fergie (yes THAT Fergie) ends up eaten here? That Bruce Willis falls flat on the floor, as it decomposes? That Carlos Gallardo (El Mariachi) plays the main gunslinger? That Robert Rodriguez kills (the character played by ) his own preschool son - his son plays a part where he ends up dead. That his real-life family doctor actually plays a doctor? There's so much to learn and talk about and it's all on second disk's extra but Rose McGowan absolutely steals the show. She played a relatively short part in Death Proof but her Planet Terror role is likely to be the role of her lifetime. She's simply perfect, sensational, stunningly beautiful and deadly accurate when it comes to shooting with that leg-mounted machine gun.<br /><br />But, I wasn't planning to talk much about the movie itself. I only wanted to make some brief remarks about the Blu-ray edition of Planet Terror.<br /><br />To my surprise, Planet Terror goes a lot farther than any of the previous Tarantino-related (yes, I know, it's Robert Rodriguez) Blu-ray releases in actually taking advantage of the Blu-ray technology. A lot farther than Death Proof, Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs.<br /><br />Disk one, has TWO versions of the movie. The 'scratched' original and, surprisingly (because Death Proof lacks it) a mostly 'clean' copy. In addition to the 'regular' and the traditional 'commentary' sound track it's possible to select the 'audience reaction track' (available on the 'scratched' version only. Interestingly, the 'clean' version does not include the 'Machete Man' introduction.<br /><br />The sound track is Dolby TrueHD or Dolby 5.1 in English and it is so on both the 'regular' and the 'audience reaction' tracks. French and Spanish tracks are also available in Dolby 5.1 only. Subtitles are English or Spanish but not in French.<br /><br />As it is the case with Death Proof, BD Live is one of the options listed as a 'special feature' but, when selected, you are told to that it is not available at this time and to 'check back later'.<br /><br />The second disk is full of rather interesting featurettes. There's an 11 minute one titled '10-minute film school' where Robert Rodriguez talks about the making of the movie, there are shorts on 'the gals' and the 'boys', extras on the special effects, trailers, etc., etc., etc. and, to my surprise, the quality of extras is quite decent.<br /><br />Briefly: it goes a long way but not 'all the way' toward taking advantage of Blu-ray, some of the options and features implementation are confusing (see above), for reasons impossible to comprehend it claims to have BD Live but it does not, the second disk, full of extras is actually worth watching.<br /><br />This edition earns its 4 stars.</p></body></html>

I loved the Grindhouse films of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAE7O0">Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R7HY0K">Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, but this one -- despite its excellent cast -- just didn't do "it" for me. Especially shoddy was Jessica Alba who made me wonder if she really had to try hard to be that bad of an actress. The action is plentiful and the gore is hilarious; and I realize that that was Rodriguez's aim. However, there's something about it that I wasn't too taken with. There's absolutely no "rewatching" value to this film even though it delivers on the action. Whereas "Grindhouse" pulled off the cheesy acting along with the action superbly, "Machete" just feels like a wasted exercise in trying to reach the same goal. Plus, it hits a little too close to the real-life border wars that are going on right now in the south/Mexico. I'm not political at all which is why I think I didn't appreciate Rodriguez taking a political hot topic and using this film (of all films) to make his own political statement (albeit in a cheesy fashion: "We didn't cross the border! The border crossed us!") It's good for a rent but I wouldn't buy it!</p></body></html>

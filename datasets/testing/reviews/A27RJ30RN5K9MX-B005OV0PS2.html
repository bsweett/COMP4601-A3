<meta name="summary" content="Now this was a good movie!!"></head><body><p>The film focuses on a man named Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski ( Jeff Bridges). The Dude is a man that spends his days smoking weed and bowling. The story kicks into action when a pair of thugs, break into his apartment and mistake The Dude for a millionaire with the same name. The thugs demand money, and to get their point across, one of them ruins The Dude's favorite rug by urinating on it. When The Dude discovers that there is a millionaire with his name, he attempts to seek compensation in the form of a new rug. The millionaire refuses to give The Dude a new rug and claims that it is not his fault. Shortly after, the millionaire's young wife (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, and the millionaire agrees to give The Dude a new rug if he helps to get his wife back. The Dude sets out to save the millionaire's wife with the help of his best friend Walter(John Goodman) and soon finds himself thrust into a world of violence and intrigue that upsets his easy going way of life.<br /><br />Only the Cohen Brothers could come up with a film like this. The story, wide variety of interesting characters, and the overall uniqueness that the film posesses provide for a funny and enjoyable film. Jeff Bridges gives the best performance of his career as The Dude. His extremely laid back and lazy lifestyle will have you laughing for the majority of the film. The character is so lazy, that he writes a check for 69 cents at one point in the film. Jeff Bridges nailed the role so well that you would think that he really smokes. John Goodman gives one of the best, if not the best role of his career as The Dude's best friend and Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak. Walter's unique viewers on life and his constant use of profanity will have you cracking up for the whole movie. Some other great performances came from John Turturo as an eccentric bowler named Jesus and Juliane Moore as an erotic artist named Maude whose art consists of lying naked on a canvas. I was also particulary impressed with the camera work in this movie. At times, the camera offers a view from inside the holes of a bowling ball.<br /><br />The Big Lebowski is probably one of the funniest and most creative films that I have ever seen. Despite the fact that the film appears to be stupid on paper, the actors involved and other unique aspects of this movie will keep you laughing and entertained for the entire film. The DVD is worth the money because the Cohen Brothers talk for a solid 30 minutes on the making of "The Big Lebowski".<br /><br />A solid 5 stars...</p></body></html>

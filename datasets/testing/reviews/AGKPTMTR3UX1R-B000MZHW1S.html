Strictly for the selfish reason of finding the stone, Archer helps the man, Solomon Vandy, to escape, and together, they seek Vandy's scattered family and the diamond even while being hunted by all three sides in Sierra Leone's hideous civil war, the Sierra Leone government, the rebels, and troops of white mercenaries who veer between roles as protectors, liberators and pirates with evil ease.<br /><br />Archer and Vandy's odyssey is marked by all the nightmares of the conflict: rape squads, child soldiers, slavery, random pointless slaughter and destruction, and mayhem mutilation as punishment. The unfortunate victims had hands, feet, limbs, their tongues or their eyes removed for any reason at all or no reason at the whim of whatever group was choosing to victimize them.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly plays an American journalist reporting on the stories of this largely unknown killing field. The beautiful Connelly plays her role convincingly, but she's an insufficient distraction against a backdrop in which almost no one seems to have a higher motive than their own greed, their own survival, or their own aggrandizement.<br /><br />BLOOD DIAMOND is masterfully made and presented, but it suffers from an overly formulaic approach, constantly reminding the viewer that the conflict diamond genocide is an important issue. This is a "message" movie, and while it IS an important message, the viewer is left both ultimately troubled and impotent. Yes, this is a horror . . . but it seems there's nothing we can do.<br /><br />As Connelly says at one moment: "Why would I risk my story just to help a single person . . . ? I can't believe I said that." Sadly enough for our own humanity, that is the moral of BLOOD DIAMOND in a sentence or less.</p></body></html>

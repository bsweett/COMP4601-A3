<meta name="summary" content="THIS MOVIE OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!"></head><body><p>"I know what happened; you were afraid. Who wouldn't be?"<br /><br />- V<br /><br />I bring in this qoute from the movie becuase I have to say that this movie totally blows your mind on so many levels. The character known only as "V" looks like your simple, reptative man in a mask who is either a superhero or a serial killer. I'm sure that we've all seen that song and dance before. This, in turn, makes moviewatchers afriad to go see the movie thinking that it will be unoriginal and just more of the same nonsense formula that everyonE and their cousin has already seen. This is not true.<br /><br />This story, like a good book, evolves on the screen. It unfolds and strikes purpose into the hearts, minds, and spirits of many people who have watched it.<br /><br />When me and my girlfriend first thought of going to see a movie, we both agreed on V for Vendetta in hopes that it would be unique and that it would stand out among all movies made from 1920's--to---2005. And our minds were thankfully melted in a moment of sheer nostalgia grace. This movie has a life of its own! It breathes heart and sheds tears in your soul. The perfect movie of 2006 has finally arrived, knocking on the door in the famous V persona with a rose to greet us all with.<br /><br />After the first viewing, we had to see it again imedietally and . . .were blown away for a second time!<br /><br />This movie, you should know, is not your typical action-movie-superhero story. It has a deeper meaning and an even deeper plotline. The story is mult-layered with symbols, history, operatic, and sometimes funny, scenes all mixed together in a tapestry of hope.<br /><br />The begining, middle, and ending were perfect in every way. Period.<br /><br />I have no gripes or any thing bad to say about it becuase for me it is impossible to do so. It just is.<br /><br />Whether you like the movie or hate it; it did its job in making you think. Since that fateful day, and that 8.00 dollar ticket stubb, me and my girlfriend can not shuddap about how fluidly brillant this gem of a movie is!<br /><br />We've seen it three times in all and, in all probability will go see it a fourth and fifth.<br /><br />And we will both own the dvd and watch it until it breaks from lack of oxygen from never leaving our dvd players!<br /><br />To those who don't like the movie I will say that you are entitled to your opinion but I believe that when you invest your time watching a movie . . . your head should be clear, a clean slate, if you will. All political views, likes, dislikes, and moods should be tossed out the car window on your way to the theater.<br /><br />Take this into perspective: Everyone knows that there are numerous superheroes, correct? There's Batman, Super-man, Spider-man, X-men, many more. Now, when you go to watch any of those seprate movies do you really expect for any of those movies to have character cross-overs or a relation to each other? No. Why? Becuase each of those movies exist in their own little world.<br /><br />V for Vendetta, aside from being the best movie you will ever see in your entire life, has been beaten with remarks and comments that it's attacking political views. No it's not. When you see this movie you must keep an open mind!<br /><br />This is such a good movie, it deserves its own GENRE category!<br /><br />What I liked the most about this film is that it was never corny, but always sly; never stupid, always smart; never overhyped, always reaching expectations; never predictable, always unexpected; never Normal, always original; Characters have scope, they never are two-dimensional.<br /><br />Each frame is like a comic-book panel!<br /><br />This isn't a movie, folks! THIS IS MOVING ART!!!!<br /><br />And so, on an ending note, let it be known that I could compliment this movie in explosive detail.<br /><br />This movie made me remember the fifth of November and my girlfriend as well. And we will always remember the persona of that delictably mischieviously independent masked vigilante "V".<br /><br />Just know that this movie reaches the goal of being different and memorable.<br /><br />IT OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!!<br /><br />IT'S EVEN TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE MATRIX!!!!!!</p></body></html>

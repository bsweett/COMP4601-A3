<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Westerns in Years!"></head><body><p>If you are in the mood for a slow paced western, this is the one to see. It is not quite as slow moving as Unforgiven and the acting is top notch especially Robert Duvall who is both funny and convincing as a cowboy. The final gun shootout takes a while to happen, but once it does, it is a 15 minute gun fight that will probably go down as one of the very best western gun fights in cinematic history. Kevin Costner has finally directed and acted in a good movie. I put this one just a notch below Dances with Wolves, but it is still one of his best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Pretty Silly Movie, But Fun Anyway"></head><body><p>OK, OK, it's a pretty silly movie overall. But it is also a lot of fun. I'll go for fun, even when silly. Well, maybe even partly because of the silly.<br /><br />You want to hear silly? Guess who plays Tracy Turnblad's mother? John Travolta! I kid you not! I thought when I first saw her that she was in drag, but it was not until I saw the closing credits that I was sure. Yep, John Travolta as a middle-aged fat lady whose husband (Christopher Walken) is very much in love with her.<br /><br />Tracy is played by Nikki Blonsky, and is a bouncy butterball. It's not realistic, because if she was really as bouncy as that, running and dancing and all, she wouldn't be so fat. But anyway, if you once accept the premise for her and her mother, the rest of the movie is great fun.<br /><br />Tracy and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) are crazy about the Corny Collins Show, a local TV show in Baltimore that plays in the late afternoon, but is not really a take-off on American Bandstand. There are dancers, including Link Larkin with the curl down his forehead (Zac Efron), and blonde bitch Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), whose mother is the station manager (Michelle Pfeiffer) and quite the bitch herself. Amber is quite proprietary about Link, but he doesn't seem impressed with her, and in fact ends up falling in love with Tracy.<br /><br />I told you it was pretty unrealistic, didn't I? Perhaps having been a fat girl who loved handsome boys when I was young, I find the story pretty hard to believe.<br /><br />Anyway, Tracy is added to the show's dance troupe in the strangest way, but that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Tracy is sent to detention at school, and finds that it is full of Negroes. Yep, Negroes, not blacks. That came later. And she makes friends, singing and dancing friends, of course. It turns out the Corny Collins show has Negro Day once a month, with Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) as the hostess. They are so segregated that a dance which has both Negroes and whites has a white rope down the middle of the dance floor, and no one is supposed to cross the line.<br /><br />Tracy does. But when Negro Day is cancelled, Tracy and her new-found friends decide to march in protest, and insist that the show be integrated.<br /><br />There's a great deal more, including plenty of silly sight jokes (Tracy's dad runs a joke shop), dancing and singing through the streets, and all the teen-age cliches you might expect from a movie set in 1962 in Baltimore. The costumes and sets alone are worth the two hours of your time. Heck, seeing Travolta in such effective drag would be worth that all by itself!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="86 and 99 Together Again"></head><body><p>Get Smart is a well done remake of the show made into a feature film. The cast is well chosen for their roles and it's a laugh a minute. Maxwell Smart and the more experienced field agent, Agent 99, go on a mission to Russia to find a bakery that specializes in yellow cake uranium. The over-sized KAOS agent, like Jaws from James Bond, is out to stop them. There are many funny scenes in this movie from start to finish.</p></body></html>

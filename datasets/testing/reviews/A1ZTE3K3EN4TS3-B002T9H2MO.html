<meta name="summary" content="Great independent film that has a big budget feel to it"></head><body><p>I have no idea why this movie was never seen in theaters. While you have some of the more boring high-budget films out there, this one slipped through the cracks because it's an independent film, but it doesn't seem like it. Sam Rockwell does an incredible job of portraying different aspects of the character, and Kevin Spacey really puts a lot into his vocal work for Sam's only companion, a robotic assistant.<br /><br />The special effects here are top notch, but it's the story that takes center stage. There were several times when I thought I would know what was going to happen, but the story would turn from there. I honestly never saw the ending coming, and that made it much more satisfying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Poor Anneliese..."></head><body><p>I had very high expectations of this film because I studied under the school of techniques put forth by the author of the book it was based on--Dr. Felicitas Goodman. She was a shaman, but in my eyes not only a shaman, but one of the last of the forerunners in the western world who was truly schooled in the olde way yet capable of working that path into the frequencies and energy currently available to the planet. She was a rare bird. Apart from her very open and well schooled view on shamanic work, she had the ability to blend the psychological, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual into her work to create amazing outcomes. She excluded nothing. So of course in that light the film had nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />The film is based on her book "The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel", and it's fantastic. The book is her translation of the documents and letters surrounding the possession and subsequent death of Annelise Michel. I could elaborate all day on what makes it unique in the field of depossession. Suffice it to say that she stumbled on some findings that if others in the western world had conceived, did not have the confidence to assert them publicly. I had read her other works before this one and already realized her contributions in shamanism, but when I read this book I really felt like I was reading the words of a pioneer in an incredibly misunderstood field of wellbeing.<br /><br />Anneliese was a young German woman from a very closed off town that was deeply religious. No really--deeply religious, which is very significant to her plight. As she became college aged and was faced with moving to the city and having a boyfriend she began to have problems. Thinking they were mental concerns she was treated for epilepsy. She insisted that she was possessed and the medications weren't helping. As she was an adult and could legally decide for herself, she eventually stopped taking the drugs, stopped eating, and died while the exorcism was being carried out. She essentially chose to starve herself to death. Her parents and two priests went to prison short-term for her death.<br /><br />The film butchered her story. It still managed to assert some of the core truths of Goodman's work, but it was all very wrapped in conjecture and voodoo. The film's goal was to blend a horror and courtroom drama and it failed both miserably. It really should have picked one and run with it. It wasn't particularly scary, but there was one scene that lasted a split second that was gruesomely gorgeous. It was absolutely haunting and it really seemed to capture the essence of what Anneliese actually went through. I am going to check out "Requiem" when it comes out on DVD, as it's supposed to be more true to her life story. It always irks me that Hollywood has to shake up real cases of experiences with the paranormal, when if they would stick to the real story, it's far more hair raising than any special effect. But we don't want to portray the truth of what's possible. That would be too close to home.</p></body></html>

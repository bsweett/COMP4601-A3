<meta name="summary" content="Bridget Jones: The Lack of Reason."></head><body><p>The only reason there's a second BRIDGET JONES movie is because the first one turned out to be pretty good and made itself some money. That's the same reason there's a second BRIDGET JONES book, and there's nothing wrong with using that justification to make a movie.<br /><br />However, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON departs from what made the first film so charming, instead concentrating on the goofball slapstick of Bridget, rather than her inherent "Everywoman" quality that made her so relatable.<br /><br />Lots of women know what it's like to be stood up for a date or to be lied to by a cad. Hardly any women or other members of the target audience for BRIDGET JONES know what it's like to be under arrest and held in a Thai women's prison. (I also doubt, in that situation, that most women would spend their time choreographing a Madonna number for fellow inmates.) Other women likely aren't going to accidentally end up skiing down a championship racing slope. Or skydive into a vat of pig slop. Or get into another of the groan-inducingly unrealistic situations that the makers of the film put Bridget in.<br /><br />The movie's not like the second novel, either, which has its own set of flaws. The second novel didn't even include the Daniel Cleaver character, but the movie had to find a way to include Hugh Grant - so they threw him in there.<br /><br />The problems of the romance between Darcy and Bridget, like in the book, could be solved if the two of them just sat down and had an open conversation. But, instead, we're treated to the situation - and the movie AND Renee Zellweger's wavering accent - just getting worse and worse.<br /><br />That said, the romance is interesting. Colin Firth is good. Renee Zellweger is good enough. And the movie makes London look awfully pretty.</p></body></html>

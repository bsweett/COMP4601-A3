And the guy's cyber buddy who also runs the site is telling Moore to "Go home and die."<br /><br />Real nice guys.<br /><br />I'm betting Moore knew the Republican response this movie would get. Socialized health care will destroy life on earth. But to everybody else, this film was a way we could all relate to each other because we know the pain that comes with the American system. We either don't have health care or we do but we never seem be covered for the procedure that we need at the time.<br /><br />This film calls for a change. The Republican system of throwing cash at corporations and hoping for the best is not working. It never has. It's time to do the American thing, the Christian thing, the human thing and make sure that every person in this country has access to health care at any point in their life and whenever they need it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The beauty of an argument is that if you argue correctly, you're never wrong.""></head><body><p>Politically incorrect, and full of mordent humor Thank You for Smoking is a dark comedy of the most devilish kind, and it stars the hunky Aaron Eckhart in one of his most multi-faceted roles yet. Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, the brash, smooth talking, sexy and smart headed spokesman for the tobacco lobby. He's so revered by the medical and anti-smoking establishments that he's become the self-proclaimed "merchant of death."<br /><br />No one in Nick's life is particularly happy that he does this job, least of all his ex-wife Jill (Kim Dickens), who worries about the powerful influence Nick has on his young son Joey (Cameron Bright), who absorbs dad's key lesson: "The beauty of an argument is that if you argue correctly, you're never wrong." Although Nick has never been to college, he has an ineffable talent to put the spin on any subject, and he has no moral hesitations about being a spokesperson for an industry, which is responsible for the death of millions.<br /><br />A chief anti-smoking combatant, liberal Vermont Sen. Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), is lobbying to emblazon a skull-and-crossbones on every cigarette pack label. The Captain (Robert Duvall), heads the Academy of Tobacco Studies and Nick is enlisted to combat the senator's plan. Desperately searching for a way to get people smoking, Nick comes up with the idea to show glamorous movie stars smoking again so he heads for Hollywood to schmooze Zen-spouting uber-agent Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe).<br /><br />While Nick deals with death threats, a near-lethal kidnapping plot and the angry original Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott), now dying of cancer, the real stumbling block comes from a devastating profile in the Washington Probe by Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes). Is Nick's world going to come crashing down? Or is he going to survive the witch-hunt against him to fight another day?<br /><br />The film is packed with irreverence, mostly in the form of clever one-liners as it skillfully skewers corporate spin culture, political correctness, ultimately twisting the idea of personal freedom.  Nick's argument is that everyone has a right to smoke, regardless of how bad other people think it is for them. The film might have been merely another sarcastically slick smack down of a culture dominated by doublespeak. Instead, director Jason Reitman's script and his incisive cast - including the wonderful Maria Bello - gives sufficient analytical foundation to the film's wry cheekiness.<br /><br />Eckhart is perfectly cast. He's a smarmy, handsome, clever corporate confidence trickster, who exudes a breezy confidence and oozes a moral elasticity always with a smug smile that never excludes likeability. And although the movie's ending doesn't quite hold together and maintain the same level of coolly cynical insightfulness that comes before, it also doesn't sell Nick out and go for fake deliverance. We see him achieve a kind of epiphany when he thinks of his son and smoking, but the old Nick is still there, as amorally ambiguous and as self-righteous as ever.

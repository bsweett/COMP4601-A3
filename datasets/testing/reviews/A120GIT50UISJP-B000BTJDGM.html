<meta name="summary" content="An interesting exploration of faith, with some flaws."></head><body><p>This movie begins at the end. Emily Rose [Jennifer Carpenter] is dead, and her priest, Father Moore [Tom Wilkinson] is in custory. Prosecuting him is devout church-goer Ethan Thomas [Scott Campbell]; defending him is hard-drinking, hard-working agnostic Erin Brunner [Laura Linney]. This juxtaposition of faith and doubt, and how each character is tested and forced to the brink of a crisis of belief makes for a engaging, suspenseful story. In addition, Jennifer Carpenter's acting, done with very little makeup and instead through incredible body and face control, is masterful.<br /><br />The Exorcism of Emily Rose could have been a four-star movie. What holds it back is two things--as interesting as the character's struggles are, they could have been more richly drawn. The result feels more like chess pieces moving about a board than people being tormented by their beliefs. Also, the medical aspects of the case are very poorly handled--the diagnosis of epilepsy is made without ruling out other likely causes, such as brain tumor, metabolic disorder. This may seem nit-picky, but anyone who remembers how medicine was used in the Exorcist will know that delving into this and the invasion of the body that it brings would make an effective foil to the demonic invasion. They could have gotten the medicine right and made a better movie.<br /><br />Still, very worth seeing, but don't set your expectations too high.</p></body></html>

Gentle giant John Coffey is falsely accused of brutally murdering two little girls<br />The movie in fact begins in 1999 when we meet Paul Edgecombe as an elderly man haunted by the ghost of his past<br />The movie then flashes back to 1935 where the younger Edgecombe is a prison guard played by Tom Hanks. With a good team of good men with the exception of the hateful Percy Wetmore -the men have to deal with the strange instance of a seemingly gentle but imposingly huge black man ,John Coffey, (Michael Clarke Duncan) , accused of a hideous murder<br />We are introduced to several new characters including an old Cajun eccentric Eduard De la Croix (Peter Jeter), a mouse that does tricks and a demonic evil psycho known as Wild Bill Wharton (Sam Rockwell)<br />Then things become remarkable when John Coffey begins to perform miracles including curing Edgecombe's excruciating urinary infection, bringing a dead (and crushed) mouse back to life and full health and then most remarkably healing the aging Prison Governor's terminally ill wife of the brain tumour that is causing her insanity  and illness<br />We found out through a remarkable vision passed on from Coffey to Edgecombe that it was Wild Bill who had committed the diabolical murder of the two children and it was Coffey who had attempted to bring them back to life with his God given powers -but tragically too late<br />Alas the real murderer now lies dead in his cell through Coffeys own act of retribution on Wild Bill through the other villain -Wetmore<br />Therefore no one is left alive to prove Coffeys innocence and Edgecombe must now put a man to death who he knows to be innocent as cannot prove the truth (perhaps with the forensic advancements available today thing may have been different  ????)<br />Coffey goes to his death as a Christlike figure , a man of pure goodness and one of God's miracle workers condemned to die in front of a jeering mob for the crimes of others.<p>It is a remarkable movie-inspiring ,poignant and beautiful-one of the masterpieces of the 1990's</p></body></html>

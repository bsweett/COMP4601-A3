Actors who are very well known and recognized as some of the best in the business are seen in it.  So why does this movie stink so badly?  Well what they are really trying to capitalize on is simply everyone's fascination with skull and bones.  Everyone thinks oh yeah it is a secret club with influence so it is bad, well you know most people don't know anything about it in the first place, they just see some film depict a secret meeting and turn into hordes of walking zombies, ranting and raving "Bush and Kerry were in it!" I just laugh.  The way they spied and used recon and photographs to figure stuff out is kind of neat you know, because that is how they did it back then.  The lady getting thrown out of the airplane on her way to being married was by far the most sickening and sad scene in the film.  Other than that it just plods along like a legless zombie, crawling...reaching...for something it cannot capture.  Do your research because I did and most of the supposed "facts" of this film in regards to the beginning of the CIA are not even true, which just further shows how Hollywood will bastardize anything of the truth in order to sway the masses and make some money.  They easily accomplish the former, but the latter category they may have fallen short.  Then yeah spice it up with more skull bones meetings which are really so boring and full of false pomp that it is a wonder anyone has figured out these are less deadly than the gangs of thugs that are currently residing in places like Detroit and Orange County.  DeNiro is a great actor but he really cannot save this film.  Damon is superior in this role but Brangelina is clearly distracted by something and is not very focused.  Then again was she ever a great actress or is it just her attractive figure that gets her into this movie?  This film is like some complex dream that Oliver Stone had but forgot half of it so he let some stoner write the rest of the script don't you think?  Now here is a thought if you had snakes on that plane then they would not have had time to throw that woman out of there would they?  I think I will tag this movie with Brangelina and Snakes on a plane.</p></body></html>

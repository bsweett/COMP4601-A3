Well, to be perfectly honest, they didn't re-make Willy Wonka. They made Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. I am a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version, but was open to see this one because of who was behind it. Tim Burton and company didn't re-do Gene or anything else. This is more of the story that Roald Dahl wrote. It is no secret that Dahl himself wasn't really happy about the original film. It was different. For those of you out there who have not read the book, this may come as a shock. A shock that this fancy new version that they may deem as an "insult" to the original is actually closer to the actual story. This is why this is not so much a re-make, as much as a new try at the actual story that Dahl wrote. The Indian prince, Wonka crash landing at the Bucket residence, both parents being there, and other things, were all in the book. Not in Wilder's version. Burton is a perfect fit for this movie, and he whisks us away into another gorgeous looking world. The film still manages to evoke the fond memories of the original, and it has that Burton feel of whimsical fantasy like "Edward Scissorhands" and "Big Fish". There is no denying that the movie looks great. The story, as if you didn't already know it and no need to go through it again, puts more emphasis on the Wonka character and his background. The storyline about Wonka's father is new and added on to the movie. It is interesting. How many of you have wondered where this man came from?. Johnny Depp is incredible. He looks funky and speaks in weird tones, but you can't take your eyes off of him. He is quite amazing, and pulls off whatever it is he is trying to do. This is not Wilder's Wonka. This is a whole new conception. The set design and effects are wondrous. No matter how a Burton movie turns out, you know it will look great and be a visionary treat. This one is no exception. Young Freddie Highmore is wonderful as Charlie Bucket. He is a wonderful little young actor, and really brings young Charlie to life. Deep Roy plays all of the Oompa Loompas. That's right. Every single one of them is the same guy. His part is where the only music comes in. This is not a musical in the way the original was. And that's for the best. The other kids are all wonderfully pulled together, and they don't stray too far at all from the original portrayals. One thing I think is missing is the humor. Don't get me wrong, there is hummor here and I chuckled a few times, but it's not the humor like in the original. The original was kind of black, but it's missing here. Bummer. The movie also has a narration, which the original did not. The new narration adds that whimsical fairy tale quality to it. I believe it is Christopher Lee doing the narration. He also pops up in the film as Wonka's never before seen father. "Charlie" is not the greatest thing ever made, but it is a feast for the eyes and for the kids in all of us. I doubt it will take over from the original, but it is well done in it's own right. I didn't find it to be scary at all. Others say it was too scary for kids, or that their kids were scared. I don't see it. I had three kids, all under 7, watch it and were totally enraptured. Burton continues to be a genius, and Depp his muse. I look forward to further pairings. These guys are just magic.</p></body></html>

It never looked or sounded better. I prefer the Dolby Surround sound on the widescreen tape to the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound on the DVD. The Dolby Surround has more ambient effect and the rear channels have more sound emanating from them. However, the VHS picture can not compare to the high quality image of the DVD. This is Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece for sure. Solidly told and acted it manages to intertwine a very intriguing plot with the delicate emotional manipulation of its main characters, which explores the fragile nature of the human psyche.</p></body></html>

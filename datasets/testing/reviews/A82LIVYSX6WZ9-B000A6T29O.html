Angelina is really annoying in this part, its antiedupped by the butler who is played by Red Dwarf's Chris Barrie who portrays Rimmer on the show, he is the only thing likable in this fishy smelling film. the action scenes are a yawn and the ending with that globe thing is just a total waste of my time. its dead in the water for me</p></body></html>

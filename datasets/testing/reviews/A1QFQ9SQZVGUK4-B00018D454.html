<meta name="summary" content="Awful movie, Excellent DVD!"></head><body><p>While the film was a tepid remake of a horror classic, I'm basing this 5 star rating strictly on the DVD.<p>The packaging was great (metal front cover) and we get &quot;evidence&quot; photos, an Ed Gein documentary and Eric Balfour naked! That alone is worth $30 to see!</p></body></html>

Some of the other characters weren't that great either in terms of their acting abilities, but "The Rock" was the worst offender. Basically, this is my only gripe with this film--- Poor acting performances by the cast!<br /><br />Otherwise, the action, stunts, costuming, make-up, special effects/computer graphics and storyline were all fine.</p></body></html>

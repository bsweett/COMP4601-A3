<meta name="summary" content="Haunting Story, Scary Statement Of A Radical Gone Amok"></head><body><p>This is a very, very disturbing documentary about a sick individual, a man who re-named himself, "Timothy Treadwell: Kind Warrior. " The most alarming aspect of this biography may not be his lunacy but the huge of numbers of people out there who support a wacko like Treadwell. That's frightening.<br /><br />This was a very interesting film, but not one I would recommend particularly to my friends, at least those who are offended by the f-word. There are 50 cases of that in here so be forewarned. There are also a few short scenes that will visually disgust you. In other words, this is not an easy film to watch and "Grizzly Man" may sound like a nice Disney adventure but it is anything but family fare.<br /><br />The movie gets points for keeping one's attention and making us think about it, but a film on horrible car crashes could have the same shocking effect, so I wouldn't go overboard in praising this film just because it held our attention. Nonetheless, an intriguing film and one that should encourage intelligent debate, and for that, it's very good.<br /><br />Veteran German filmmaker Werner Herzog narrated and put together this film, from many hours of footage all shot by Treadwell. Suffice to say the documentary paints a disturbing portrait of a Far Left radical who goes way over the edge. If Treadwell was a Christian, the filmmakers would be quick to point out here is another "religous nut," but Treadwell was the opposite, a non-believer, a man who admitted he was clueless when it came to whether there is a God or not or what He would be called. I only mention this because Treadwell's atheism points out one of the dangers of it: you make up your own set of rights and wrongs, based solely on what pleases you, what you can live comfortably with, and it's extremely selfish and usually very destructive in the long run.<br /><br />Treadwell worshiped himself....period. He loved his looks, his courage, his noble actions, as he puts it, on and on. Just listen to him. That constant "I love you" to all the animals and even insects was another mask for his inability to adjust to his own human species and sexuality. In his selfishness, he forces himself on a world that wants no part of him and where he has no business being......all in the name of being this great protector of animals.<br /><br />An extremist like Treadwell winds up hurting his well-meaning environmental cause for the more sensible people who might be on his side, but at least have respect for laws, know the difference between humans and animals and have tolerance for all viewpoints. Treadwell cared only for himself, despite his claims, and to filmmaker Herzog's credit, he shows this.<br /><br />The real tragedy in the whole story was that someone else also died a horrible, violent, unnecessary death along with Treadwell. And - despite Treadwell and his friends opinions - human beings are far more precious than animals.</p></body></html>

I thought it completely immersed you in this futuristic world. Charlize Theoren was the perfect choice for Aeon and it makes a sort of Actor/Director connection that makes this movie great. This film reminds me of the original (Matrix and Ghost in the Shell). This movie is about a huge conspiracy that the population of this world is unaware of. Also a resistance has been formed to stop this illusion. It may seem confusing at first, buy you just have to "think outside the box" in order to understand it. Also don't let a horney immature thirteen year boy watch this DVD, cause their's a scene when Aeon is half naked which was (SWEET)! I also recommed y'all get (Ultraviolent) the movie, when it comes to DVD. It's better then Aeon Flux.<br /><br />I love this movie like I love "Hakugei: The Legend of Moby Dick" its an anime series.</p></body></html>

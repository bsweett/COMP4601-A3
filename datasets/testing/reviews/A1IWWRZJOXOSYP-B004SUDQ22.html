But it's a film that has stayed with me and left a lasting impression.  For me, that's an indication of quality.<br /><br />Director John Madden ("Capt. Corelli's Mandolin) re-unites with the star Gwyneth Paltrow from 1998's "Shakespeare in Love" that resulted in a Best Director nomination for him and a Best Actress Oscar for her.  Paltrow got glowing reviews for her performance as Catherine in David Auburn's play on the West End stage in London.  The mathematics-laden premise translates fairly well to screen.<br /><br />At times we are confused.  First, it seems that Anthony Hopkins is real and helping his daughter celebrate her birthday.  Then we learn through her dialogue with Jake Gyllenhaal's character Hal that Catherine's father was a brilliant mathematician who suffered from mental illness and has died.  Gyllenhaal who came off a very hot year with an Oscar nomination for "Brokeback Mountain" and a lead performance in "Jarheads" seems very likeable here.  Even so, we're unsure if he's using Catherine or if he's cultivating a relationship.<br /><br />There was a little film called "The Secret Life of Dentists" that starred Hope Davis as a dentist having an affair.  She gave a complex albeit less than likeable performance, much as she does here as Claire, Catherine's sister who is persuaded that like their dad, Catherine is also losing her mind.  With films like "The Daytrippers" & "Next Stop Wonderland," she's creating an interesting body of work.<br /><br />Although there are some strange notes in the film such as Hal's band that seems to invade their party, it's the relationships between the characters that make the film memorable.  A daughter's connection to her father that is strong can inspire her for a lifetime.  Seeing Catherine discover her own brilliance and come to believe it is also quite moving.  This was a little film that our local cinema refused to bring here to the large screen.  It's well worth investigating on DVD.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

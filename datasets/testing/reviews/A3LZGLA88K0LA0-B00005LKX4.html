<meta name="summary" content="HANNIBULL"></head><body><p>The main problem with this second entry in the Lechter series is that is has no focus and it doesn't use the Lechter/Starling relationship to its fullest.  Director Ridley Scott has opted to create a noirish, somewhat gory film whose script wanders around a little too much.  In the ten years since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Lechter has found refuge in Florence, taking over as curator of an art museum; meanwhile, Starling has continued with the FBI, reaching the point where her actions are questioned; she's even received a letter from the Guiness Book of World Records for being the female who has killed the most people.  Add to this the character of Mason Vergis, Lechter's fourth victim and only survivor who peeled off his face at Lechter's request and who now wants to use Starling to lure out Lechter so he can get his revenge.  As if this isn't enough plot, we get an Italian detective who stumbled on to Lechter and wants to get the three million dollar reward offered by Vergis.  HANNIBAL suffers inevitably from being too plot driven and sources indicate screenwriter David Mamet's original script was completely overhauled, although Mamet's name is still in the credits.  Anthony Hopkins continues to instill a strong sense of evil and menace, although this time he is somewhat overdrawn, almost to the point of parody.  Julianne Moore who stepped in when Jodie Foster opted out due to script differences, brings a different approach to Starling, although I'm not sure it's a good one.  Ray Liotta is menacing as a corrupt government official, and his last scenes are grand guignol horror; an uncredited Gary Oldman is lost behind the makeup of Vergis, while Italian superstar Giancarlo Giannini brings a good sense of desperation and greed to his role as the Italian detective.  There is sumptuous photography and New Age artist Hans Zimmer's score is appropriate, but HANNIBAL ends up being mere eye candy and is not as good as the other two films.</p></body></html>

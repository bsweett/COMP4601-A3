Each time I watch it, it gets funnier and funnier!<p>You have the take the whole thing as a fun campy movie. Bill Murray is great as his character goes from egocentric weatherman to caring individual. Sure, this bizarre timewarp just &quot;appears&quot;. Sure, much of Bill's motivation to change is that he just wants to escape the warp, not that he (at least initially) really cares about the people he's helping. But it's all in fun, and the bizarre things that go on are hilarious.<p>There isn't any great redemption in the movie, or mystic message ... it's simply a lot of fun to watch, to catch all the subtle ways things change as the day continually loops back into itself for Bill. If you ever feel like you're stuck in a rut, this is the perfect movie to help you laugh your way out!</p></body></html>

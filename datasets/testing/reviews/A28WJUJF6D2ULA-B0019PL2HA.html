I expected a laugh or two for my money, Will Farrell's generally good for that, and was prepared to suffer through a lot to get them but this truly, deeply, achingly bad movie was one of the most egregious misfires to come down the pike since the Dumb & Dumber prequel. I'm not a comedy snob, I'll take laughs where I can get them, gags about bodily fluids, farts and amorous overweight old ladies not excluded, but this film oozed a stench that effectively covered anything resembling humor. This was one Blu-ray that went straight to the nearest Goodwill once I was done with it.</p></body></html>

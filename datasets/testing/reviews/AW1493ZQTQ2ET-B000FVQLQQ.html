<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>Having read the book, I was quite disappointed with this movie.  Sure, the movie is gripping because the story is tragically sad and the acting is pretty good.  In this sense, the movie does a good of job highlighting the impact of serious mental illness and the need to help those who are dealing with it.  But the problem is that the movie is about a real person, and comparison with the book (which I trust) shows that the movie left out and changed so many key elements that it represents an unacceptable distortion of the truth of John Nash's life.  I could go into detail by giving many examples, but instead I urge you to simply read the book (or listen to the audiobook).  The true story is far more powerful and interesting than this ridiculously popularized movie.</p></body></html>

I enjoyed his last film "Mystic River" and was happy to see it receive such praise. But, "Million Dollar Baby" just came into the night, no one knew anything about it, and I thought, honestly how good could a boxing movie be?<br /><br /> Then the critics rallied behind this movie just as strongly as they have been the sadly overrated "Sideways". Roger Ebert and all three of the NY Times critics placed it on their "top ten" list. Two of them placed it at number one. And of course the recent news that the film has won seven Oscar nominations and thus opened to more screen also provoked me to see this film.<br /><br /> "Million Dollar Baby" first of all, is NOT a boxing movie in the traditional sense. Yes, there are boxing scenes, but, the movie is really about so many other things and has an amazing twist in its third act. The film is about hopes, dreams, courage, friendship, love and many other things that I can't give away here.<br /><br /> The film has an almost breezy effect. I didn't even realize when the first hour and 40 minutes went by. The film takes its time setting up characters and the plot. Infact, you couldn't seperate the two. This is one of those character driven movies. It's not really about the plot but the emotion we feel for the characters.<br /><br /> Eastwood has so effectively paced the film. It has a lyrical feel to it.<br /><br /> But for as good as "Million Dollar Baby' is, it does have some flaws. First of all the film's last act goes on a bit too long. Here Eastwood and the screenwriter are "milking" the situation for all it's worth. They are doing this so the emotion connection will be strong, but, by the time the events do happen. we're hooked. We've been hooked from the first 10 minutes. The film could have been shorten 15 minutes and still retain the power is does.<br /><br /> I've heard people find the film depressing, why? I find it to be a 'feel good movie'. I had a warm feeling while watching it. I came to feel as if I knew the characters. I was put in a very good mood.<br /><br /> Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hiliary Swank are all believeable in their roles. We never for a moment say to ourselves, "hey, there's Clint!" No, we accept them as the characters. This is the film's major strenght.<br /><br /> And about those seven Oscar nominations. I really don't think any of them are deserved. Now, that doesn't mean I don't like the film. A movie doesn't have to win or get nominated for an award to be good. I hope people don't need to have a film win an award to appreciate it.<br /><br /> "Million Dollar Baby" is a knockout. A simple story told in a simple style with an amazing effect.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Clint Eastwood's has a knockout with this film. Everyone is believeable in their roles. A movie about people instead of plot. No special effects, no nudity, just heart.</p></body></html>

His urine is checked so his diet can be adjusted.  Even his clothing is put up in his cabinet in an orderly utilitarian fashion.<br /><br />So, why does Six-Echo want to win the lottery and go to the island?  He's been told all his life that this is the place where the human race will continue and survive.<br /><br />And that's not quite a lie.  Lincoln Six-Echo and the others like him are living to continue the human race.  They're 'property' (aka clones), bought and paid for by the richest and wealthiest as an insurance policy against damage to their own persons.<br /><br />Initially, clients buying into the insurance were told that their clones would be kept in a persistent vegetative state; however, by the E generation, the scientists realized they needed to give the donors memory and awareness.<br /><br />And that's where the problem comes in.  Lincoln Six-Echo is dreaming of boats, learning Latin phrases when his lessons are deliberately kept at only a barely functional level.  He's gaining awareness--and memory that's not his.<br /><br />When Lincoln Six-Echo stumbles across the truth, he stops his best friend Jordan Two-Delta from going to the island and they both escape into the real world.  Their challenge is to find their sponsors and convince them to help them.<br /><br />But, the corporation that developed them will do anything to keep their business and keep the secret of the clones quiet.  That includes hiring a crack team of Ex-Special Forces agents to hunt down and kill the escapees.<br /><br />Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) leads the squad. He puts the two ill-prepared clones through their paces.<br /><br />"The Island" is fast-paced and very well done.  Imagery is beautifully filmed.  I honestly wish I had not missed this film on the big screen.  One of the best futuristic chase scenes, including cars, trucks, and helos is here.<br /><br />I was especially impressed with Ewan McGregor's performance as both Lincoln Six-Echo and Tom Lincoln. Very subtle moves convey the differences between the original and the copy.<br /><br />Overall, "The Island" is well worth the time to watch.  My half-star deduction is for a somewhat slow start.</p></body></html>

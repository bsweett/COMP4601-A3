IT'S BACK!! then all hell breaks loose and once again it's everywhere. everything is out of control it seems that nothing or no one can stop it, or can they? who knows, but one thing i do know you definitly have to watch this sequal. one of the good ones. i give them props, and it's good enough to watch again and again. very real, and an eye opener because you never know what and when somethings could happen. another look at the human race on the verge of extinction, and what we as humans do to survive, or some do just to simply eliminate the problem. sometimes things aren't so simple. the first one was impressive, and this second one leaves you wanting more. very well done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest movies of all time!"></head><body><p>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Walt Disney's first animated motion picture, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; is the bizarre mix of images that strike the mind in various ways. It's rare in any day to find such a film that delights one with humor and enchanting music, and at the same time gets under the skin with a dark sense of dread and urgency underneath its conflict. &quot;Snow White&quot; is not only a technical masterpiece, but a true work of art that stands out among the very best in any time period of cinema. <p>For film historians, it stands out as a marvel of the achievement of technology. Being the first full-length animated feature of its kind, &quot;Snow White&quot; is seamless in its integration of detailed characters into articulately-drawn settings, with extreme attention of such details as water reflection, shadow movement, and even lip movement of the characters, an especially difficult task given the amount of song and dialogue. For this, it receives high marks all around, and earns itself a place in movie history. <p>It's the ultimate battle of good and evil, in which young Snow White finds herself the target of the Queen's growing jealousy. She flees into the woods, where she comes to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, who gladly welcome the new arrival. Just as their friendship together becomes increasingly joyful, the movie darkens the tone with the Queen's transformation into an old peddler woman, hoping to rid herself of Snow White's threat to her being fairest in the land once again. <p>&quot;Snow White&quot; is a special sort of film, one that is ceaseless in its ability to entertain the young and old. Watching it as a child is the ultimate experience, while watching it in later years will no doubt provide many with cherished memories of their first time seeing the film. It's the type of movie you find yourself looking back on with happiness and satisfaction, the mark of a truly great film.<p>Perhaps the movie's most memorable aspect is its contrast of light and dark imagery, a neverending foray for some of the most memorable scenes and images ever put forth onto the screen. Snow White's happy existence among the Dwarfs is full of glee and humor, and provides delight at every turn of the story. In complete contrast, Snow White's escape into the forest takes us on a terrifying journey through our own worst fears; the scene is charged with suspense and an intensity unmatched by any modern movie. The Queen's transformation scene is an absinthe-induced hallucination of dizzying images, and the final confrontation between the Dwarfs and the Queen is a suspense-laden race against time. <p>The film's most memorable trait is its musical score, filled with cheery melodies and upbeat tunes, from the infamous &quot;Heigh Ho&quot; and &quot;Whistle While You Work,&quot; to the operatic &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come.&quot; Just as this music is full of joy, there are chords of music that are extremely unsettling, such as that of the opening shot, in which we see the castle looming over the river, set to high-pitched strings that set a foreboding tone. The music works with the movie to bring out the emotions it wants us to feel, whether it be overjoyed exuberance or nervous anticipation. <p>It's everything a perfect fairy tale should be, and the film captures not only the Grimm's tale magnificently, but also realizes the many ways in which fairy tales manage to work our minds. It takes us to a place in our fancy, the places we cherish and adore, and the places we would rather leave behind. At its center is a story full of moral truth and virtue, and every nuance is brought to stunning life with love and care put forth. &quot;Snow White&quot; is the ultimate masterpiece, a cherished piece of movie history that remains with you long after it has finished, and one that will be forever remembered.</p></body></html>

This is one of those movies that will keep your full attention for the entire length. Ashton Kutcher, in his first serious role, plays surprisingly well in this movie. He shows us a side that I hope we'll see again. But for the kind of person he is, Kutcher does an excellent job portraying his character. Amy Smart, William Lee Scott, and Elden Henson all have done a great job on acting out on different levels of their characters with the same core in each variation.<br /><br />Who ever wrote this was a smart person. There needs to be more intelligent writers. It is a big responsibility to entertain our public. A movie such as this makes us think about "what if" affects us emotionally, yet changes our physical world, thus putting great responsibility on the writer. This writer did very well and I thank him. We could use more thought feed movies in our world today. Imagine no war and always peace. Would our Bush agree to war, and What would happen if we all could go back to September 11th. Too many people focus on personal gain. Would it not benefit us all in a personal way to have peace? One act of kindness can be felt around the world. One violent thought not acted upon can cause a positive movement, just like that of a butterfly. The tension builds up quickly and you're never quite given a chance to relax before the end. I like that in a movie...it keeps you on your toes.<br /><br />This movie is very well done and well structured. There are no low points in this movie - each scene has a point and ties directly into the main idea of the movie. The ending is great as it made me feel sad but happy of its outcome. I'm glad that this movie was brought to my attention because its simply fantastic. I'll definitely watch this again just in case I missed anything. Recommend to those who haven't seen it yet.</p></body></html>

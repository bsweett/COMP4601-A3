<meta name="summary" content="The fairy tale you never heard of..."></head><body><p>This movie follows the Grimm brothers thru Europe during their heyday.  Although don't look at this movie as a real representation of the two brothers.  If you don't know who the Grimm brothers are they have created some of the greatest fairytales.  Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood are just two of their many fantastic tales.  This movie creates a less than stellar tale.<br /><br />First off trying to capture what the movie is about.  Is it a whimiscal tale or a tale of two cons.  You eventually find out this story is a little of both.  The Grimm Brothers have been captured by the French and it's up to them to reveal the mystery of why so many children are disappearing from a Germanic village.  The brothers are portrayed as conmen trying to deceive people of precious money in order to rid them of fake ghosts.  Now the brothers must find the real answer as to why these children keep disappearing.<br /><br />This movie attempts to thrill but doesn't do a very good job of it.  It seems like a cross between a childrens tale and an adult movie.  Unfortunately it fails at both.  I believe this movie would have been much better if it was geared towards children.  Although many of the Grimm Brothers tales were violent they have been sanitized over the years.  Not to say this movie is awful it just misses it's mark.  Very little suspense or scary scenes here.  It's hard to hang on any characters since known seem very endearing.<br /><br />Now the movie looks great on Blu-ray.  It sounds great on Blu-ray.  Generally if you like fantasy type movies with mystical environments this movie may be for you.  Although it's hard to justify the purchase.</p></body></html>

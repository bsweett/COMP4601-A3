MacReady), Keith David (Childs), Joel Polis (Fuchs), Thomas Waites (Windows), Wilford Brimley (Blair), T.K. Carter (Nauls), David Clennon (Palmer), Richard A. Dysart (Copper), Charles Hallahan (Norris), Peter Maloney (Bennings), Richard Masur (Clark), and Donald Moffat (Garry) are on an Antarctic expedition.  One day, they spot a dog being pursued by men in a helicopter.  The writings on the side of the helicopter identify it as Norwegian.  The Norwegians are intent on killing the dog.  The dog safely reaches the American camp, and the Norwegian is killed by Garry.  The group questions why the Norwegians were so intent on killing a dog.  MacReady decides to fly his helicopter over to the Norwegian camp to investigate.  Once there, they discover that the Norwegian camp has been destroyed, and strange forms appear to have been burned. Also, they find out that the Norwegians have discovered an alien spacecraft which has been buried under the ice for thousands of years. The group takes back one of the forms to the American camp.<br /><br />After analysis, Dr. Blair reports that the alien organism has the power to take on any life form it wishes, from dog to human.  The members of the team immediately begin to suspect that some of their own group may have become infected.  The race is now on to kill the alien while at the same time keeping an eye on the other team members.  Who will win; the alien or the team members?<br /><br />This is a teriffic movie.  The story is very good, and the special effects are excellent.  If you're a fan of horror and sci fi movies, then this is a must-see.</p></body></html>

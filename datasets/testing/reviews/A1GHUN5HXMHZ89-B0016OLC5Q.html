<meta name="summary" content="Into the Wilderness Blindly"></head><body><p>Although compelling and beautifully captured, I found it meandered a bit. The young mans journey from family shelter to wilderness starvation is brave but misguided. I especially like the scenes on the river. However; a tighter edited version bringing it in around two hours would have been better received. The story of a man throwing away his parents values and striking out on his own is not new. The method used to show us that journey was unique. Good acting and great scenery make this worth a rental. We have all stumbled during our years after High School or even after College, but few cast common sense to the wind. McCandles does, so although we sympathize with his convictions, we cannot applaud his lack of logic.<br /><br />In college I too went camping to get away from it all and I even jumped off a seventy-five foot clift into water with rocks everywhere. Do you truly think if I had hit one of those rocks they would think it was a great story to make a movie about? Doubtful but even I was an experienced diver and so although not brilliant, at least I knew what I was doing. Just as I went camping with my father and anyone else with experience before going into the wild on my own. So although the movie has good acting, great camera work, and excellent directing, that doesn't make me like the story. Afterall lots of hippies did this during the 1960s and I don't see books or movies about most of them. I guess because thats old stuff and Sean Penn didn't direct a movie about it. I might have been more inclined to recommend purchasing it if it was shorter and had a positive message. Think about what it says to most teens. Good quality DVD with fair replayability.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good -- but definitely not a "date" movie"></head><body><p>As a rule, I have a high tolerance for violence and gore in movies, but this one squicked even me. It's certainly the most nightmare-inducing film I've seen recently. The setting is very noir, a dark and rainy unnamed city, in which the youngish Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is replacing Det. Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who is about to retire. Then a series of horrific murders begins -- from which the camera never pans away -- themed on the Seven Deadly sins, and there's a lot of chasing about in alleys and tenements. The serial killer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey, who can be a little creepy even when he's not playing a role. It's all madness and mayhem delivered up in a tight, non-predictable script, largely as seen through Somerset's dour, pessimistic view of the world. It's the sort of film you can admire without actually liking it much. Especially the ending.</p></body></html>

People were scrambling for a glimpse of the cast and it was great fun. I also have to commend Reilly for his bravery when his character, Cal Naughton Jr., slips on the Speedo in the hot tub scene. You can tell the actors enjoyed making this comedy and I'm grateful for the laughs. Sacha Baron Cohen adds an extra dimension to the race track as a 'not afraid to show my gayness' driver who leaves skidmarks on Will Ferrell's backside. Though it spins a lot of stereotypes out of control and creates a few new ones, I don't believe race car fans were insulted (if they were they take themselves too seriously). This is wonderful hilarity and just in time for the New Year. You go Ricky Bobby!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

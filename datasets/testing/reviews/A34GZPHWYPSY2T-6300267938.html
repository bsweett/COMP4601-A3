No doubt it always will be.<br /><br />Briefly, so I will never spoil anything, this film is about a returning Confederate officer Ethan (Wayne) who seems to rub his brother the wrong way, though the family adores him. The day following his arrival, the Comanche spring a murder raid on the family ranch, killing Ethan's brother Aaron, Aaron's wife, and kidnapping the two daughters. Ethan and another go on the hunt for these girls - a hunt that will last five years.<br /><br />Wayne gives what is for him a powerhouse performance here, but then he always gave such performances. His acting has been called unequalled, because he allegedly never equaled it again, and that's false. He gave this film the perfect twist, and the only feller I think might have done better is Gary Cooper.<br /><br />The subtle (and sometimes unnecessary) humor along with the star power will dazzle you. The scenery and cinematography will make your liver quiver. The action will make your knees freeze (you'll see everything from "Law & Order" to "NCIS" to every movie you can imagine in some of these scenes). The last third of the film will make your bladder splatter. [THANK YOU, Little Richard!]<br /><br />They say this film influences more films than any group or genre of films. They also say this is the best film ever made. They say this is far and away THE Western film of all time ... but "they" say lots of things. For me, this film is a slice of childhood that I still enjoy once or twice a year. It is still the reason we play cowboys and Indians, and for that I must remove a star from its rating. That anti-Native sentiment was ugly then and is ugly now. Hence Ford's film about the subject.<br /><br />Ford was decent and caring, though he hated to show it. He loved Kurosawa and was touched that "Mr. Kurosawa" looked up to him as a father. Ford was also aware that he had re-engineered Kurosawa's way of making film after THE SEARCHERS was released. Ford changed us all.</p></body></html>

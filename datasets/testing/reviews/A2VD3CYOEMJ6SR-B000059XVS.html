<meta name="summary" content="An epic classic"></head><body><p>This movie, which won best picture in 1962, features soaring desert scapes and an orchestral score that can sweep you away. Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence, the British major who led Arab tribes against the Turkish occupiers during World War II. A steller supporting cast includes Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness. Lawrence unites disparate tribes of Arabs and leads them into battle, first taking Aqaba and ultimately, leading them into Damascus. His motivation is a mystery. Does he do it because he is an adventurer or, does he have a love of the Arab peolple, or, a hatred of the Turks? Perhaps, he is a bit of a rebel and can only operate in the British military performing a special service rather than serve in the regular army. Perhaps his rebeliousness leads him to compete against his British army superiors as he seeks to outdo them. We never can be sure.<br /><br />Lawrence goes through experiences that change him. He is not the same person coming out of his experiences, some of which are trying. Indeed, he becomes capable of savagry that even makes some of his Arab allies squirm. As great as this human dimension is, the raw beauty of the desert is what makes this film as great as it is. What an extraordinary job of location filming. A large cast engages in military charges on horseback and camel. These scenes are stirring. The actors had to learn to ride camels and they did so convincingly. It's a long epic and it might ne hard to see in one sitting but, conveniently there is an intermission, which is he point that divides disk one from disk 2. Also, there is a great documentary in the second disk in which Shariff, the late Quinn and others are interviewed. I recommend this great Oscar winner.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="American Psycho is a Great Movie"></head><body><p>Christian Bale turns in a great performance in this disturbing yet darkly comic tale of an 80's yuppie with a bloodlust as strong as his self obsession. The movie serves as a time capsule to the 80's and the materialism that consumed American culture at the time. There are scenes in this movie that made me laugh my a## off. For lovers of dark humor and social commentary. Highly recommed for sensible viewers.</p></body></html>

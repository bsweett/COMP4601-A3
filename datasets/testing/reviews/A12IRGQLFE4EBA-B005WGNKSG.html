<meta name="summary" content="A Good, Solid Story"></head><body><p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the story of a very smart, though emotionally disturbed, young woman who through a couple of coincidences and twists finds herself working with a recently terminated progressive journalist on a private murder case.  Unfortunately, I watched the English dubbed version which, in my opinion, took away from the movie.  I'm thinking the English subtitles would have been better (note to future viewers), but it was still a very good film.  There was nothing "new" as far as plot goes.  No strange or unbelievable sequences.... just a good, solid story.  Not having read the trilogy of books that the movie is adapted from, I don't know how it compares, but if you haven't read the books either, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Also, keep in mind that it's a foreign film which usually means that it can be a bit edgy and raw compared to an American made film.  There were a few scenes that I found disturbing, but that's mostly because I've been Hollywood-ized (lol)!<br /><br />I really liked this and plan to watch the others.  Another version is currently being made with Daniel Craig -- I shudder to think (though Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard will be in it so it may not be that bad).  I'm glad I saw this one first.</p></body></html>

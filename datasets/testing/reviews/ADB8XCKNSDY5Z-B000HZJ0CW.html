<meta name="summary" content="Finally, A Decent Bad Guy"></head><body><p>First Contact was the best Next Generation movie, but this is my favorite Next Generation movie.  It's still not great, but I like it a little bit more than the other ones.  I think it's because this movie spends a little more time developing the villian than the other movies do.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you can't develop a villian in two hours that will match a cast of heros that were developed over seven years.  This film gives it a try though, and doesn't do a bad job.  The only problem is, so much screen time is spent developing this villian that not enough time is available to go to the familiar cast we all know and love.  It was a no-win situation.<br /><br />Watch this to see what happens.  You can watch it again if you want, but don't pay a lot of money to do so.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Doctor Johnny And Mr. Depp..."></head><body><p>Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) has had it rough. He's a writer with a terrible case of writer's block. On top of that, it's been six months since his divorce, and he still can't get over it. Enter John Shooter (John Turturro), a mysterious man from Mississippi who shows up at Rainey's cabin door one day. Shooter claims that Mort has stolen his story and begins threatening him and making demands. Rainey slowly realizes that this guy is very unstable and quite dangerous, especially after Shooter performs some shocking animal cruelty on Rainey's pooch. Things get increasingly worse, escalating into murder and madness. Can Rainey prove that he didn't steal this maniac's story? Well, it's just not that simple! There's more to this than your typical stalker / madman flick. As the tale unfolds, we get small clues as to what's really going on. SECRET WINDOW is a solid thriller with some nice twists and turns (in a "sixth sense" / "the others" sort of way). I found the whole thing both entertaining and creepy. Johnny Depp is great, proving once more that he can play any role he's given, no matter how strange. Cheers...</p></body></html>

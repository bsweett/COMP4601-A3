Whether you're after atmosphere as thick as smoke, tight-lipped anti-heroes, charmingly bad audio dubs or a cast of thousands, this grand adventure delivers in excess. With a run time of just under three hours, it should go without saying that the narrative sprawls at times, yet expert cinematography, intriguingly era-authentic landscapes, a variety of fresh, varied locations and rich characterization keep the picture from stagnating even when it's been ten minutes since the last line of dialog. Naturally, Leone regulars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef bring the goods as remotely feuding foils with a penchant for sharp, icy glares; though I preferred their dynamic in the preceding For a Few Dollars More, the two make for a stunning combination whenever they share the screen and it's a shame this marks the end of that brief partnership. It's a terrific picture if you've got the time to really pore over it, but works equally as well as simple background noise.</p></body></html>

Like certain people on the net, I too saw the 'greatest moments' that this film had to offer, and after watching the movie, it rings true to its audacious nature.  The harbinger of the audacity is Nicholas Cage, who REALLY overacted to the point of hilarity.  Cage has always been eccentric for his entire career, but he went completely batty for this film; It's like the actor has channeled Jack Bauer and tried to follow that method for the entire movie.  His character spend most of the time yelling and being unnecessarily aggressive towards the fellow women of Summersile.  I know he's a cop and he's serious in helping his ex-wife find her daughter, but there's a thing called composure; he clearly didn't know how to stay calm even when nothing's going on.  His over-the-top acting, not to mentions his actions like when he's running on a field of beehives, was nevertheless my source of joy for this film.<br /><br />Take my 3-star review with grain of salt.  If you're not amused by a theatrical car crash, then you might as well look away.  Technically, "The Wicker Man" is a two-star movie at best, and not just because Nicholas Cage isn't the right actor for the role.  The scare tactics are tacky and it's strongly misogynistic in how women are viewed as vindictive and deceptive (though in my opinion, this movie doesn't insult all women; just the amish ones).  I don't think the movie is nonsensical plot-wise, although the whole prologue with the car crash didn't served anything in the long run; the twist in the end was very elaborate (if I hadn't seen the video, I probably wouldn't see it coming), and I had to wonder why such a scenario wasn't simplified to just have it done on the first day.  On the unironic side, it does have good cinematography and the costumes were nicely woven.<br /><br />It's recommended to only see the unrated version, since the theatrical cut has a rushed third act and a cop-out epilogue that had no purpose; plus, only the unrated cut had the bee scene.  It's only a slight improvement to an otherwise flawed movie, but really, the movie is in lieu to "Dreamcatcher": both are lousy horror movies, but both are hilarious popcorn-fodder.</p></body></html>

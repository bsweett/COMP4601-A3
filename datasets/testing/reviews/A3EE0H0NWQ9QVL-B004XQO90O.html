It makes us look at a public scene where some imminent violence or calamity is about to take place, and then backs up to show us the same scene again with a different point-of-view.  (Except this time, the protagonist relives the same moments and scenes on a commuter train.)  As has been stated time and time again, `Source Code''s method may be preposterous science fiction--like anime' adventure `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWYJ68">Paprika</a>--' but its thrust is decidedly more closely aligned to `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z8GZYW">Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)</a>'.<br /><br />The story begins with a disoriented Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who finds himself on a commuter train headed to Chicago.  Next to him is a woman identifying herself as his girlfriend, Christine (Michelle Monaghan).  A serious of events take place:  Someone spills coffee on his shoe; he gets up; someone knocks over a file with papers in it; and he goes to the bathroom where a mirror shows him to be someone else than he knows himself to be.<br /><br />After a series of awkward moves, he sees his train pass another train, and both blow up into oblivion...Then, we are taken into a military vessel, much resembling a small space unit, where Colter is received on a screen with instructions from Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who gets him to use a "source code" technology, which enables him to relive the scene, find information, and prevent otherwise inevitable catastrophe.<br /><br />He fights the mission with a fervent confusion--not able to fully comprehend when he was on an earlier mission--not in incognito and on the war front of Afghanistan.  To get him on track, Goodwin and her superior officer, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), have to brief him as quickly as possible because their intelligence program is in experimental infancy with many harrowing risks for Colter and civilization at large...<br /><br />The causality of `Source Code' is easily as fanciful as `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG980U">Inception</a>,' but the story is much easier to follow, and the format and development admirably suspend disbelief in ways that few movies do.  While similar movies can be awkwardly paced, tediously unfolded, or convoluted beyond our senses, `Source Code' is satisfying popcorn entertainment with an admirable message about the brevity and preciousness of life without ever being weighed down by stale or labored moments.<br /><br />(Credit information is taken from IMDB.com)</p></body></html>

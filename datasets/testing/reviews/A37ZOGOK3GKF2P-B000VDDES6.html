Will Ferrell is in top form, Christina Applegate is equally as funny, and the whole supporting cast is funnier than 4 seasons of SNL and MadTV combined.  Ron is like a younger Ted Baxter (you know, from the Mary Tyler Moore show) but on acid.  Good ole Ted certainly couldn't have gotten away with things as Ron did.  Great cameos flesh out the movie and are numberous.  This is one dern good movie.  Now, fair warnng:  IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO LAUGH THEN THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU.  More comedies should be this funny.  Kinda braindead but still SO funny!  Sit back, relax and DON'T think so much.  Enjoy...</p></body></html>

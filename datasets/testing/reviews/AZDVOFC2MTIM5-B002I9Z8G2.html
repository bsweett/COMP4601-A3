<meta name="summary" content="..The Has Been Drawn..."></head><body><p>Of the four films featuring The Next Generation crew,ST:FC is the best ,even ranking among The Wrath Of Khan,The Voyage Home,and The Undiscovered Country.Unlike the other TNG films,this is not a two hour big budget TV episode,but a real movie that's fast paced,action packed and has agree of warmth and humor.<br /><br /> Patrick Stewart is always a command presence as Capt.Picard(Kirk may be the best Captain,but Stewart is the best actor to sit in the chair),and his quest for vengence against the Borg is captivating as well as terrifying.And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations.<br /><br /> A great battle scene with the Borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes alternating between 2063 earth and a war zone with the Borg on the new Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all too convienient TV ending.<br /><br /> Aside from these minor flaws ST:FC is a movie to be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You've heard about the movie, want to know about the DVD?"></head><body><p>Because Crouching Tiger was released in Taiwan before it came to the States, it is only natural that the DVD was released there earlier, too.  Nearly identical to the proposed Ameican release (the US version adds the &quot;making of&quot; documentary), I purchased a copy of the Region 3 version of this great movie.<p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon itself is a gorgeous, sensual story, boosting HK action movies to an entirely new level (although it is doubtful that many will be able to or even want to follow this act).  The story is fairly straightforward: a master swordsman searches for his lost weapon, stolen by an enigmatic thief.  Add to that a healthy dose of unrequited love, another love story that may very well become unrequited, and of course the legendary fighting scenes, and you've got a great film.<p>Subtitles don't really matter here, unlike some other films.  After 5 minutes, you won't even notice you're reading them.<p>Now, for information on the DVD.<p>The commentary track, in English, is one of the best tracks I've heard.  Rather than the usual back-patting (so-and-so was SO GREAT to work with!), Ang Lee and James Schamus discuss the difficulties behind making scripted scenes come to life, the risks they took in making the movie (10 minutes before the first fight? A 20 minute flashback?), and other aspects of production.  For those who like an educational commentary, this one is great.<p>The interview with Michele Yeoh is pretty much the standard movie-promotion fare, and the music videos are interesting as additions (for some reason, they seem really grainy, too).  This DVD looks and sounds great, and even the animated menus (if they keep the ones that are on the Region 3 disc) are clever.<p>There are very few DVDs that are &quot;must-own.&quot;  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of them.  Do not hesitate, and when it comes, savor every minute.</p></body></html>

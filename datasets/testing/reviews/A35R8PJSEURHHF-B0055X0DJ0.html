<meta name="summary" content="Let's blow something up!!"></head><body><p>The Good:<br />- Action, action, and more action.<br />- This movie must hold the record for the most things blown up in a movie.<br />- Main characters weren't too bad to look at.<br />- Special effects were kinda cool.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Plot - Robots needing to destroy our sun for energy?  Lame<br />- The mother being attacked by a non-transformed waffle iron.<br />- Almost all of the robot tag-alongs were completely annoying.<br />- Cheesy romance/break up scenes throughout the movie<br />- Robot balls, oompa loompa sighting, and humping robot.<br />- The fact that I didnt care if they saved the world or not or if the robots died or not.<br /><br />The movie provided some entertainment, although it was a little long.  Not terrible, but certainly not an amazing movie.  The comedic elements thrown in are just a distraction.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good for the comics fan"></head><body><p>It's another comic book rendered into live action. On the whole, it's pretty good. The WWII Germans are the bad guys, our flawed Hellboy is the hero, and he gets the hot female lead in the last scene. Yes, I said hot.<br /><br />The pace is good, the attitude is bad (that's good), and the effects are good. The visual presentation helps move the story along. For example, almost the entire first sequence is bluish monochrome with two colored exceptions: Our Hero is red, and the Evil Babe's lipstick is red. That tells you who to watch. OK, it's not subtle, but this is a comic. I'll look elsewhere for subtlety.<br /><br />(BTW, I've never read Hellboy comics. I probably won't start, even though I liked the movie. Lots of other comics are good, too, and my preferences lie in other directions.)<br /><br />Maybe you like comics. Maybe you like action movies based on over-the-top characters. Maybe you want a flick that's exciting enough, but where people stay mostly dressed and the gore is kept under control. If so, the movie has a fair bit to offer. Go ahead, enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

Maybe prevent a bomb from detonating on a train? And if not that, can you reconcile with your estranged family? Or kiss the girl you just fell in love with? SOURCE CODE is a sci-fi thriller, and it's got its clever on. Running at a no-nonsense 94 minutes, it's spare and efficient and that's partly why it works. It drives up that sense of immediacy.<br /><br />If, during the first fifteen minutes or so (or even deeper in), you've become all baffled, then that means the plot's got you where it wants you. This is one of them films that drops a big reveal every few minutes. It helps that our reluctant protagonist is in the same state of bewilderment. 17th Airborne helicopter pilot, Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) suddenly finds himself on a Chicago commuter train seated opposite a lovely co-passenger chatting him up familiarly. Not too long after he glances at a mirror and sees someone else's face gazing back at him. And eight minutes after he'd first come to, the train explodes, killing everyone onboard, including him, false face and all.<br /><br />Colter Stevens now finds himself holed up in a sort of containment pod in some nebulous Army lab. A scientist informs him of the tragic train bombing which had happened earlier that day. She mentions experimental technology which would allow his consciousness to be projected onto the last eight minutes of the memories of one of the victims. Except that Colter Stevens would be able to act and therefore alter those memories. It's not really time travel, but for brevity's sake and because it's a sexier label, let's stick with that. Colter's mission is to locate the explosive device on the train and unearth the bomber... in eight minutes' time. You can see why the guy would need to be sent back time and again. With each reinsertion, with each new variation on how these eight minutes play out, Colter gets that much closer to piecing the puzzle together. And, somewhere along the way, he falls in love with that lovely co-passenger. And since she's being played by Michelle Monaghan who simply has this way about her, it's understandable.<br /><br />Operation Beleaguered Castle is the experimental program what's guinea-pigging Colter Stevens, and this venture just may end up saving countless lives, except that there's such a dehumanizing element involved. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a strong, wired performance as our hero purposely kept in the dark for a huge chunk of the film. He's strongly advised to not dig into his own recent past. Our guy demonstrates his ornery streak.<br /><br />Obviously, given the premise, there are bits of parallelism with films like GROUNDHOG DAY, 12:01, and DEJA VU, and if you're a fan of time travel (although, again, this isn't really time travel), you'll lap up what unfolds on the screen. Even if, in spots, you're rendered bewildered and perplexed and confounded (but having tremendous fun, all the same). I will say that I do agree with some of them other folks what said SOURCE CODE should've ended with the freeze frame sequence. That would've carried a more potent and poignant statement. Instead, the film trots out several codas too many, opts for a more conventional and rather chickensh_- ending. But that's my only bugaboo. This is a ripper of a movie, thrilling and surprising and smart and mostly full of good choices. And they're playing me for a sucker but I can't help but be amused each time Jake Gyllenhaal's character is told "Everything's gonna be okay." And then the train explodes, unfailingly.</p></body></html>

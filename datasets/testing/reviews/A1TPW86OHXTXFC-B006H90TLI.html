<meta name="summary" content="No Country For Anyone"></head><body><p>"Misguided souls will tell you that No Country for Old Men is out for blood, focused on vengeance and unconcerned with the larger world outside a standard-issue suspense plot. Those people, of course, are deaf, dumb and blind to anything that isn't spelled out between commercials on dying TV networks. McCarthy reveals a soulless America that is no country for anyone, never mind old men." Peter Travers<br /><br />Cormac McCarthy's book from whence this film came is a masterpiece. The Coen Bros. have done homage to McCarthy. Not much, if anything veered from the original manuscript. Magnificent is how I would describe this film. The characters were all as I pictured in my mind. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is the hard nosed, difficult to please but compassionate codger he was meant to be.  He knows the country is in trouble- drugs have taken over his West Texas area and nothing but trouble is to come.<br /><br />Trouble comes by the dozen and before too many scenes there are blood, bones and bodies strewn throughout the landscape. The man who has caused this massacre is Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. And by the way Mr Bardem won an Oscar for his portrayal. When you think of the worst of the worst there is Chigurh. Probably the most heinous killer in filmdom history. He likes to play games and will flip a coin for your life.  Something went wrong with one of his drug deals and all were killed and the money and drugs are gone.  Llewellyn Moss played brilliantly by Josh Brolin finds the money and the drugs and all Hell is about to break loose for the man.<br /><br />From one horrendous scene to the next, we sit on tenterhooks, holding our breath while Chigurh and Moss play cat and mouse. Action aplenty. Words of wisdom and grief from Sheriff Bell and his crew. The scenery, the photography, the score are all brilliant. Kelly MacDonald who plays Moss's wife and is an absolute smash I remembered from the BBC series "State of Play'.<br /><br />"Still, if "No Country for Old Men" were a simple face-off between the sheriff's goodness and Chigurh's undiluted evil, it would be a far stiffer, less entertaining picture. Llewellyn is the wild card -- a good old boy who lives on the borderline between good luck and bad, between outlaw and solid citizen -- and Mr. Brolin is the human center of the movie, the guy you root for and identify with even as the odds against him grow steeper by the minute. And the minutes fly by, leaving behind some unsettling notions about the bloody, absurd intransigence of fate and the noble futility of human efforts to master it. Mostly, though, "No Country for Old Men" leaves behind the jangled, stunned sensation of having witnessed a ruthless application of craft." A.O. Scott<br /><br />The best film of the year and it garnered an Oscar. Well deserved, the film was everything it should have been and more. Cormac McCarthy has been honored.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob  04-13-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8O2QU">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011V7PSC">In the Valley of Elah</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V3JGII">Coen Brothers Gift Set (Fargo / Miller's Crossing / Barton Fink / Raising Arizona / Blood Simple)</a></p></body></html>

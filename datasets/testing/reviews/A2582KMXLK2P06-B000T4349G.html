<meta name="summary" content="suspense yes, loads of it"></head><body><p>This is one case where explaining the storyline would totally spoil the mystery and suspense of the Forgotten, so I flat out *refuse* to do that. Approach with extreme caution when reading reviews for this film as they *will* spoil the majority of it. The Forgotten is honestly the kind of movie where absolutely *nothing* should be explained for fear of giving away unnecessary spoilers, other than the following-<br /><br />- Julianne Moore plays a convincing mother character who strongly believes her son was alive and well at one point but everyone in her life (such as her husband and psychiatrist) do a remarkable and believable job convincing her otherwise. The million, billion, trillion dollar question is this- is she just imagining she had a son, or did he really exist? That's ALL I'm going to say about the storyline. It simply CANNOT be spoiled.<br /><br />- Expect incredibly interesting, complex and satisfying story development throughout the movie. You won't be able to predict where it's going, believe me. Totally shocking.<br /><br />- Expect a LOT of suspense. This is most certainly not a slow-moving, barely exciting type of film. No way.<br /><br />- I've really grown to appreciate the acting talents of Julianne Moore over the years, but this movie finally has me convinced she's really believable and talented. I will never underestimate her skills again.<br /><br />And that's it folks. I will say no more about it than this.  It's for the better, believe me.</p></body></html>

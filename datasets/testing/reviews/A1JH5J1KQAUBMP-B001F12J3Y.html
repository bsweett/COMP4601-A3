<meta name="summary" content="Powerful visuals, but a thin story"></head><body><p>A young boy who has begun to doubt the existence of Santa Claus is invited to board the Polar Express, a magical train that takes children such as him to the North Pole to see Santa at work with their own eyes.  The power of this film resides in its visuals.  A process called "performance capture" was used to wed the performances of real actors to computer simulated characters and environments based on the artwork of children's author Chris Van Allsburg.  There are many magical and innovative sequences, such as the one in which we follow a lost ticket as it flutters through the air, going through a series of adventures of its own before ending up back on the train where it started.  Santa's village, which looks like a deserted Eastern European village, is quite creepy.  Christmas carols echo from loudspeakers, but they always seem to be somewhere off in the distance.<br /><br />Concerning the story, there's not much going on.  The original book is quite slim, so the movie pumps up the story to feature length with lots of action-filled misadventures.  It ends up telling the story of a journey without really having much to say about it.  Furthermore, I'm not a religious person, but even I was struck by the irony of a secular Christmas story being about a crisis of faith.  In addition, this film is really not a musical, so it's quite jarring when the characters break into song at one point.  Having said all that, I feel that the visual style of the film elevates it and grants it a power and resonance that is not present in the script./</p></body></html>

This actually was my favorite of the three.<br /><br />For those who have not read my other reviews on the X-Men movies, the theme of the series is fighting prejudice.  The bad guy mutants are ready to wage war with the humans who persecute them.  The good guy mutants try to live peaceably with humans and even protect them from the bad guys.  This one reverses the plot from the original movie:  instead of mutants trying to change humans into mutants, there is a new drug humans devised to change mutants into humans.<br /><br />This movie has a parallel theme, which is the matter of choice.  As a minister, I'm familiar with the debate over predestination and free will.  In the story, there are humans who think mutants need to be cured, mutants who oppose this cure, and mutants who believe they don't need to be cured but will allow each individual to make up their mind of whether they want to change.<br /><br />One reason I like this movie is it introduces two of my favorite X-Men comic characters that were so far absent:  The Beast, one of the original X-Men (played superbly by Kelsey Grammer), and the Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), who is a mutant in the movie though not in the comics.  Another original X-Man that makes his movie debut is the Angel.<br /><br />I found the ending of the first movie to be effectively symbolic, and there is an allusion to it in the ending of this movie.  I enjoyed several of the little tangent stories.  I didn't mind the fact that Storm got more attention than usual (and the Wolverine always dominated the stories), but many of the other characters have adequate development.  The movie does seem to close up the trilogy, but I would be happy for a spin-off or a new trilogy or something like that.</p></body></html>

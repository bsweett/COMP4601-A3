<meta name="summary" content="Lord of a New War"></head><body><p>The story itself is a real winner about a weapons dealer who is really out there as far as his wheeling and dealing. The problem is the movie slows down in too many parts and a key character (his brother in the movie) in Nicolas Cage's character's life just disappears off screen for a huge chunk of the movie.<br />Gratuitous Ian Holm, super gratuitous Ethan Hawke channeling bits of his Training day cop character as well as a dopey Matrix-like follow-the-bullet intro and it's a pretty goofy movie really.<br />I dug it but I think you really have to be in the mood for Nicolas Cage's over-the-top performance. The guy seems to be running on autopilot with these roles he takes that sort of reprise his Raising Arizona persona...actually his Valley Girl role to be honest.<br /><br />There are zero extras with the DVD. Just rent it or watch online.</p></body></html>

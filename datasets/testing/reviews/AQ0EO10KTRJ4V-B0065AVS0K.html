<meta name="summary" content="Best Comic to Movie Adaption Yet"></head><body><p>Simply stated this is the best Comic to Movie adaption ever produced yet.<br /><br />Usually Hollywood tries to re-create something that is already an established and popular media and ruins it in the process by changing the things that made it popular in the first place.<br /><br />Not here..... Sin City looks and feels like a comic come to life.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars you ask ?................<br /><br />WARNING VAGUE GENERAL SPOILER BELOW..........<br /><br />.....<br /><br />.......<br /><br />........<br /><br />.......<br /><br />......<br /><br />The only reason I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is the same reason I quit reading Miller's comics in the first place.<br /><br />In his dim "Sin City" world, the heroes rarely win the War, they only win the battles.<br /><br />Now I don't always want a cheery happy ending... but from time to time it would be nice to see a hero in Miller's world actually survive !</p></body></html>

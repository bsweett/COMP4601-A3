<meta name="summary" content="forgiveness or revenge? Make your choice..."></head><body><p>Don't worry, my opinion for part two is coming soon. The weird part for me about this series is I don't like movies with torture-but this series has a demented cleverness to it that I didn't expect. The traps are sadistic but clever, the music is creepy, and Jigsaw's game in this one is something I admire-testing someone's capacity for forgiveness over revenge is a very interesting concept. When criminals go free it does make me angry, but hatred and revenge can have serious consequences, as this chapter demonstrates in gruesome detail. Kudos to Charles Clouser for the music score-I'm not sure even Jerry Goldsmith could've made a score this creepy. Special mention must be made to Tobin Bell as Jigsaw-what he does with his voice, making it raspy to the sound of a whisper was eerily effective,he gives me chills just hearing him talk, and his voice on his tapes are the same way. I'm not gonna lie though, a couple scenes/traps in this one did make me cringe, I look forward to part 5 though.<br /><br />August 8, 2010<br />The main focus of this film is on Jigsaw's apprentice forcing a doctor to keep him alive while another test/game is taking place. These tests and traps are creepy to say the least-esp. the pig vat in the middle. I don't want the director's cut of this chapter because I saw the d's cut of the ending and decided I don't need it.<br />Now, do I think they should've ended the series here? Hell, No! Despite the ending, I'm glad the creators have come up with not just one but 5 decent sequels that connect like a puzzle. After this film though, Leigh Whannell and James Wan stepped aside as scriptwriters, but the replacements so far have done a very nice job in keeping the series interesting, however I wish Darren Lynn Bousman could've continued directing, but oh well.</p></body></html>

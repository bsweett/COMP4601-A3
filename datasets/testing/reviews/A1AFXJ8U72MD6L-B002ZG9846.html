It helps if you understand the comic book mythology but even if you don't it should still be enjoyable.  I loved how the kid tried to become a first hero and totally epic failed his first time.  It was so horrible.  Heh.  There's a good mix of humor, tension and action in this picture.  Hit-Girl, the 11 year old, takes everything to a new level.  Based on a comic book series.  WHEN WATCHED: 09/18/2010; MY GRADE: A minus to A (non comic book fans will give it lower).</p></body></html>

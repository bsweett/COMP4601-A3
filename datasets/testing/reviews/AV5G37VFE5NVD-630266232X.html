<meta name="summary" content="A great, suspenseful, romantic film noir with some fine twists"></head><body><p>I picked up "Laura" for two reasons.  The first was because I'm a huge fan of "Twin Peaks", and I've heard that the film inspired it.  (After watching it, I can see that it did, in some ways)  The second was because the premise sounded very interesting to me.<br /><br />Dana Andrews is terrific as Detective Mark McPherson, the calm policeman who is investigating the death of Laura Hunt (the wonderful Gene Tierney).  Laura was loved by everybody.  But in McPherson's book, everybody is a suspect - including Laura's fiance, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price!); Laura's aunt (Judith Anderson), who may be involved with Shelby; and the cynical, bitter Waldo Lydecker (a great performance by Clifton Webb), who introduced Laura to the world.<br /><br />Otto Preminger decided not to use any special camera angles or cinematic tricks like that, and it helps make the film seem all the more realistic.  The performances are top-notch and the script is well-written (the second draft was written by an uncredited Ring Lardner, Jr.), the latter of which features some fine twists.  There's also a now-classic score, which includes a magnificent theme song, by David Raksin.<br /><br />If you're looking for an intriguing, well-made film noir, this may be the one for you.  "Laura" is a masterpiece of the film noir genre, and it may very likely be one of the best movies ever made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is a reduced picture quality DVD to make you want to invest in Blue Ray DVD's instead"></head><body><p>I can't tell you how much I was disappointed of the picture quality of this DVD.  But, I can see what they are doing.  I just rented this DVD of "Mission Impossible III" and I know that they actually made a depreciating effort to reduce the video quality of this DVD. The picture quality of this DVD is a great deal less in quality than it easily could be.  And I've got a fantastic Samsung 32" LCD TV.  I know they made sure the picture quality of this DVD would be sub-par so that they can try to push the Blue-Ray DVD version to try and get people to start buying Blue-Ray DVD's.  I have many high quality High-Definition DVD's, so I know that it is possible to give us standard DVD player owners, a High Definition DVD of this film, but they won't.<br /><br />I started to pay attention to this when I saw "War of the Worlds" on DVD.  I thought that the picture quality of that DVD was sub-par, too.  But, the DVD of "Terminator III: Rise of the Machines", "Monsters, Inc", many of my films from the eighties, and even 1963's "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", all appear to be a High Definition (simulated) mastered release on a standard DVD.  Blue-Ray is the next new expense of getting you to keep spending your money on the same movies that you already have.<br /><br />Well, if you let yourself fall into that trap of replacing all your favorite DVD's with Blue-Ray DVD's, you're looking at an expensive future of buying all your favorite movies all over again.<br /><br />And you know what?  I'll bet, within 5 years or so from now, they'll say they've come out with something better than Blue-Ray DVD's, and you'll be suckered into replacing all your favorite DVD's once again.<br /><br />This is a never ending cycle of making sure that you keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.<br /><br />And then over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you'll buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and then you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and so on and so on.....<br /><br />If you start to invest in Blue Ray now, the movie industry obviously has you wrapped around their finger.</p></body></html>

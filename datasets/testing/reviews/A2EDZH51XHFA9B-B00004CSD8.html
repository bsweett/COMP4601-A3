If you have never seen either version of the film, not read David Seltzer's novel, and you plan to, then do not read this review until after you have done so.]<br /><br />What a frustrating movie this is, in that it is possible in many, many scenes to see what could have been. The modernizing touches made in the movie ranged from subtly brilliant to absolutely fascinating (and during the Cardinal's presentation to the Pope early on, you'll be amazed at how the original 1976 poem does match up with current events), and, of course, the better special effects these days made some scenes that were done mostly with camera trickery thirty years ago really shine. And the things they did to make sure it wasn't a shot-by-shot remake, but contained the same basic ideas (for example, transporting the monkey attack to the monkey house at the zoo, rather than the drive-through jungle park), really worked rather well. Unfortunately, some of the rest of the production doesn't live up to those things.<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock for three decades, a quick overview: a politician's wife gives birth. When said politician, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber, who seems to be sliding into typecasting as "the remake guy") gets to the hospital, he is told there were complications and the baby was lost, but there's a way to save his wife's somewhat fragile sanity: another baby was born at the same time, and the mother-- the only family the little tyke had-- died during the birth. Thorn could pass the kid off as his own and no one would be the wiser save Thorn and the hospital staff. He takes the deal, and when he wife Katharine (Julia Stiles) wakes up, hey, there's the kid, Damien. Fast forward five years. Thorn is now the ambassador to Great Britain, after his immediate superior was killed in a suspicious explosion, and Damien is five. And things start going a little bit weird-- his nanny kills herself inexplicably. A drunk priest, Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), starts showing up, darkly hinting that Thorn and his wife are in grave danger. A nosy reporter (David Thewlis) starts doing some digging. And we are pointed to the conclusion that Damien Thorn is, in fact, the Antichrist, born to begin the Tribulation foretold in the Revelation of St. John the Divine (as well as a piece of doggerel David Seltzer dashed off for the original script that has become so culturally prevalent many believe it's actually in the Bible somewhere).<br /><br />Schreiber and Stiles were probably the least appropriate choices in all of Hollywood to portray Robert and Katherine Thorn. Stiles (10 Things I Hate About You) and Schreiber (Big Night) have both done credible work in the past, but none of it shows up here. (This is something of a surprise with Scheiber, who has been known to carry entire movies in the past; he was certainly the only thing worth watching about the execrable Phantoms.) It's also a touch scary to think about Schreiber and Stiles married. Though when I look back, there was a much larger age difference between Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, so I should probably get over it. (I had no idea Peck was sixty when he made the original until just now. Now I'm even more creeped out by the original than I was previously.) This is all the more odd because the supporting players are great almost to a man; Thewlis and Postlethwaite are both stellar, as usual. And while there is what we shall refer to here as "great controversy" over Mia Farrow's casting as Mrs. Baylock, Damien's ominous new nanny, I thought she was great here. She had just the right touch of syrupy sweetness to make the deception believable. (As much as I loved Billie Whitelaw's portrayal in the original, nothing about that woman ever said "I should care for your kids." Farrow's character has the appropriate mousiness.) Michael Gambon makes a great Bugenhagen. Etc. You get the idea. Surrounding all these great (and some few mediocre) actors is the general look-and-feel of the film, which many have criticized as ripping off Final Destination (to which others have retaliated saying Final Destination ripped off the original Omen). I think both are partially correct; the idea of the Rube Goldberg-esque supernatural death almost certainly came down to Final Destination through the original Omen, but the feel of the deaths here is very twenty-first century. Consider, if you will, the scene considered the most shocking in the original movie: the decapitation of David Warner. Gregory Peck and David Warner have their argument, and it's dusty and gritty and nasty. And Satan's hand causes a worker not to set his handbrake quite right, so the truck rolls backward, and the sheet of plate glass, and the top of Warner's head bouncing off into the dust. It's ugly. It's nasty. In this version, the street where Schreiber and Thewlis play out the same argument (and, as a side note, a comparison of the two back to back will highlight the deficiencies in Schreiber's acting in this movie quite nicely), it's a much more sanitized scene, lots of brick and cobblestone, no dust at all. Instead of plate glass, the instrument of death is an iron fixture from which a peg is knocked loose by a falling hammer. Glass shatters, iron does not. There's just so much less mess about it. It's a whole different type of atmosphere. It's not necessarily a worse atmosphere; it's just different. I think that's a distinction that a lot of us film snobs refuse to make all too often, especially when it comes to a remake that is, in fact, inferior to the original; it's a cheap shot, something to pile on when heaping invective on a movie that never should've got made in the first place.<br /><br />The thing is, there's so much about The Omen's remake that says it was a film that deserved to be made, like Huston's remake of The Maltese Falcon or Verbinski's remake of Ring, and that it could have been just as good a film, if different than the original. You have to overlook some bad stuff to see it, but it is there to be seen. In truth, the bad stuff is a small part of the total package. Unfortunately, it's the part that's bound to get the most scrutiny, since it comes in the form of the two main characters. ***</p></body></html>

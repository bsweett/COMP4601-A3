Not that the original was in any ways bad, but it more rushed and didn't get a chance to spend time on a lot of the other characters.<p>Here they did what they obviously wished they had the time and budget for in the first movie.<p>More of the Mutants were showcased.  Though it was still centered on Professor X and Wolverine, it brought a bunch the other characters into the side stage.  To name a few; Iceman, Pyro, Kitty Pride, Collosus, Banshee, Nightcrawler, etc....  Plus they gave more screen time to the sultry butt kicker Mystique, whom was given a bit more depth.<p>The bad guys were again, interesting and possessed depth.  Stryker the driven war vetran that is seemingly obsessed with controlling all mutants.  The reasons why he was given the authority to do what he did and how it was carried out was frefreashing, and believable.  Notice the president was more concerned about how it would look the to public than on any sort of personal morality.  Magneto appeared again as the classic anti-hero, still focusing on his own agenda's.<p>The action sequences were longer and more brutal.  Did you notice that the only person that you see die in the first one was the senator.  True you see Toad get shocked and seem like he dies, but he is a mutant and a rather enjoyable bad guy, who knows.  Sabretooth seemed to die, but in the comics he has survived many seemingly critical wounds, and survived.  This includes having his spine broken, so he could very well show again.  This movie wolverine has an actual body count and goes through special ops like they were children.  What would you expect from a barely under control psychopath with unbreakable bones and claws.<p>All in all this was a great movie, still had some elements that were a bit hard to grasp, but it was a comic book movie and a sci fi, that is part of the game.  It treats the characters and situations with dignity and makes you care about what is going on, for good and bad guys.<p>rent or buy this if you like sci fi or plain and simple action movies, you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

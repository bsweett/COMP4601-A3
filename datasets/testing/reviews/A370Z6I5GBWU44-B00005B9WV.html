The martial arts scenes are fantastic and truly breath-taking. I love this film. One treat was the costumes - I always pay attention to these and the movie did a great job with them! This movie is a treat visually and story-wise.<br /><br />So why only a four? Well, I felt the ending was rather cliche and rushed, to be honest.</p></body></html>

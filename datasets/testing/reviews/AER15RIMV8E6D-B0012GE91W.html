<meta name="summary" content="Hogwarts: Year Five!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is definitely better than the last. It has a better and more interesting storyline. It introduces new characters such as Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix LeStrange (two very interesting female characters) The Ministry of Magic is in denial that Voldemort is back, and turns against Harry and Dumbledore. They appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher; a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic. She eventually takes control of the school, which causes Harry, Ron, and Hermione to start a rebellion against her and teach their friends how to defend themselves against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry and Voldemort will come face-to-face again when he is looking for a prophecy to kill Harry. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX!!!</p></body></html>

The actual &quot;Italian Job&quot; is a gold robbery pulled off in Venice, Italy. But it is discovered one of the team is a selfish traitor. He takes everyone else's share of the loot, kills the safecracker leader of the gang and leaves the rest for dead, but they methodically plot revenge to get their gold back - adding the 'legit' safecracker daughter of the assassinated safecracker to the team. There are plenty of plot twists, one involving the Russian mob. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron have wonderful chemistry and Edward Norton is perfectly cocky. Seth Green is also funny as the computer hacker (again - first was Enemy of the State). The Mini Cooper chase alone is worth renting this movie - it is awesome!</p></body></html>

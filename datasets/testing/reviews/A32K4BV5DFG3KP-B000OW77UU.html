<meta name="summary" content="Bad decisions and good ambition."></head><body><p>The movie was ok ,somewhat tedious at times ,alot of the same thing. I think it must be said though that although Chris Gardner was an ambitious guy who never gave up. He was guilty of making many bad decisions. Buying all of those machines, with no distributer. Taking an internship with no salary for 6 months with a small child. I'm glad it worked out for him. It seems like I've known guys like this throughout my life ,sometimes they do make it,but more often they take a nosedive and pull people down with them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is really a story about Peter Parker's choices, but four villains is too much"></head><body><p>If you view this movie as a Spidey versus a Super villain flick, the story is too cluttered and seems confusing.  James Franco is back as Harry Osborn and the New Goblin trying to avenge his father's death against Spiderman / Peter Parker.  Then there is a story revision from the first movie (not uncommon in comic books) that the guy we thought killed Uncle Ben didn't, it was Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who was trying to raise money for his sick daughter.  On top of that, a new photographer has come to the Daily Bugle to expose Spiderman as a bad guy.  This is music to J. Jonah Jameson's ears, so Parker loses income he badly needs to a kid who is trying to do him in rather than just report what actually happened.  The conflict between Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and Peter Parker is the core of the film, but it takes awhile to really gather some steam.  On top of all this there is some kind of living goo that crashed to Earth in a meteor and it is after Peter / Spidey, too.<br /><br />So, is that enough stuff for one film?  Oh, yeah, there is also the love relationship between Peter and Mary Jane that has to undergo a crisis in the film.  And it is closer to this relationship that the real point of the film lies.  This is really a story about Peter Parker becoming a man and having to choose what kind of person he will be.  The huge cast of characters are there to present Spiderman with complex choices.  Will Peter choose the self-indulgent path, give up, or choose to be a good man and a hero?  You can guess which it will be by the end of the film, but it is a circuitous route.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, and the personal crisis story does have its routes in Spiderman story traditions.  However, it isn't quite as much fun as the straightforward good-guy bad-guy smash `em with a building story.  My guess is that they powers that be felt they had done that twice already and wanted something different.  OK.  You did it.  Can we get back to Spidey fighting Rhino, Tombstone, Mysterio, or any of the other dozens of bad guys Spiderman has dealt with over the decades.  We don't need a confusing chorus of them in each film, maybe two at most.  Four is too many.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></body></html>

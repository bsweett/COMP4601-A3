A simple mistake sets off an incredible domino effect that leds to a stunning ending.  There's no way the audience can take sides because both parties are in the right.  I think the only character that was missing a serious amount of marables was Deputy Burdon.  Nothing this man did made sense and it is more him than the two opposing parties that escalates this bad situation into a colossal mess.  Whenever I thought his character was doing something holy unbelievable, I'd think about the stories that sometimes makes the ten o'clock news. (Kiddnapping, diaper-wearing astronaunts anyone?)  But what makes this film a winner is the remarkable performance by Kingsley.  Connelly, though beautiful, always seem to sleep walk through her performances.  They're not horrible, but not very memorable.  That includes A Beautiful Mind.  When I think of that Oscar vehicle, it's not her character that sticks out, it's Crowe.<br />Back to this movie, House of Sand and Fog, is a a good film and is truely worth your time, but be prepared to be a little depressed when the credits roll.</p></body></html>

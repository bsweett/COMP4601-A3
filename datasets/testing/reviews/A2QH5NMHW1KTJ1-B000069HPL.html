<meta name="summary" content="an original masterpiece, pure genious"></head><body><p>From the creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill, brings you a movie that shows in important message in life, "work sucks". The performances in this movie are amazing. They are amazing from performances from everybody. This film is a smart and intellectual film about a day in a life in a hard worker. And how they get mad of all the work they have to suffer through. <p>The story goes as Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) really just doesn't feel like going to work anymore, he really really hates it, and wants to get fired. With his new attitude and his new girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) he gets promoted and still hates his job and wants to make his boss pay for making his life miserable. He then figures a scam with his friends Michael and Samir. It is a triumph! <p>This film has really no special features. It has the theatrical trailer for the film, widescreen anamorphic 1:85:1 ratio, and cast and crew info. They should really come out with a special edition set of this movie. It should have commentary by Mike Judge. But the film still covers it. It is a smart comedy. Can be complicated, so you made need to watch this more than once if you don't know about office jobs like me. This is a must see film.</p></body></html>

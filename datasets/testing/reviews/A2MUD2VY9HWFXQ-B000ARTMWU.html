<meta name="summary" content="Tense until the end......."></head><body><p>What everyone is saying about "High Tension" is true.<br /><br />This is a rock'n good time of a horror movie until the last 20 minutes. Then the movie stumbles and falls flat on its face.<br /><br />However, up until that point, the acting, cinematography, and direction are all superb. "High Tension" is creepy and effective, and regardless of its ending is still a fine horror movie. Definately worth watching for any horror fan out there. Although the ending is quite bad, it doesnt ruin the first 3/4 of the film.<br /><br />Give it a viewing but be warned.....your gonna love it till the end.<br /><br />After that, nothing quite makes much sense!</p></body></html>

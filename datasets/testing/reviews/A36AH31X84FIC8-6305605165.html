<meta name="summary" content="Looks promising Wonderful Life."></head><body><p>This is a wonderful story about a man who has big plans but settles for the simple quiet life as he marries and has a couple of kids. but when a big problem arises in his life and he feels there is no way out. He thinks the unthinkable to end it all, only to be saved by an angel and his friends and family. he then realizes he has a wonderful life and true happiness is with family, i just love this film. It's got a good story, the kind of story you don't find nowadays. long live Jimmy Stewart he's the man.  i'm sure this will a be great edition of the film. it looks as if it contains both B&W, Color Versions of the film that are in the set to be released, i've already preordered a copy for myself and hope this is the last reissue. because there have been tons of other copies made by various companies, i say if it's not broke don't fix it that's my opinion anyway. Paramount had already released the 60th edition last year so let's hope this is a perfect edition of this classic film, that keeps on selling for years to come .  I always get a tear in my eye at the end i must confess it's a tender part.<br /><br />All in All Like The Macy's Thanksgiving Parade this film is one that warms my heart and soul around christmas time in the arms of love ones and friends. This Film is an American Institution to me, It's a classic, pure and simple everybody should own a copy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended Film.<br /><br />Update: I just watch this DVD and let  me tell you, that it's a wonderful package both Black and White and Color Versions Are Excellent and remastered very well for total clarity of picture and sound. the color version is just unbelievable,  i couldn't believe my eyes it's was better than the Republic version released in 89. and wasn't pasty looking, the colors looked natural like they belonged there. i do have agree with most of the  reviewers stating that the trailer for the queen's film, should've not been on this disc. i agree it was totally out of place to be on this DVD of such class. but that's only a small problem,  just fast forward it and enjoy the movie. curious though the color version does not have  a trailer on it thank goodness. what great buy this is, if you don't already own this film or just want an upgrade this for you . i love this edition personally because it gives you a choice of which version of the film, you want to watch on any given day.</p></body></html>

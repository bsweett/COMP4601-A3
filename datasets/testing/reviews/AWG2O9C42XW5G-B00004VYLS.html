<meta name="summary" content="The Joker"></head><body><p>Why not start off a batman sprea with the first one containing Batman's most vile and sicotic villians the Joker. Jack Nicholson portrays the joker in a meaningfull way. true that he dosen't kick Batman's butt. but he toys with him mentally. which is a good start on nicholson's part. and michael keaton as batman it could'nt get any better. Keaton portays batman in the darkside of him. this movie is awesome. Tim Burton at his best. it's a must see for all batfans</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Visually outstanding, but wearisome story"></head><body><p>This 2010 version of "The Wolfman" reminds me a lot of 1992's "Bram Stoker's Dracula." Both feature a classic monster, both take place in Great Britain during the Victorian era, both are stylistically similar, and both feature Anthony Hopkins in a major role.<br /><br />Each is visually striking but, story-wise, "Dracula" wins the prize, which isn't to say that "The Wolfman" isn't worth watching. Hopkins, Benicio Del Toro (in the title role) and Emily Blunt are all fine in their roles, it's just that somehow the story and characters aren't all that engrossing. Maybe it's because Hopkins plays a distant eccentric patriarch and Del Toro plays his brooding loner son who hides behind Shakespearean characters. It's hard to relate to them or like them. Emily Blunt is likable enough, but she's never sufficiently fleshed out and her deep love for a certain character seems a bit unlikely and forced.<br /><br />But, again, the film looks incredible and is worth viewing or owning for this reason alone. You get foggy moors, mysterious woods, gloomy estates, gypsy camps, dungeons and old London streets, all with werewolf attacks. Speaking of which, there's quite a bit of action and extreme gore interspersed throughout to keep things interesting. The music's good too.<br /><br />The DVD features both the theatrical and unrated Director's cut, the latter of which is close to 20 minutes longer, which is the version I viewed.<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B- (although, visually, it's A+ all the way)</p></body></html>

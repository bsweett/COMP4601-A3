I thought he did a good job as Kent/Superman-mainly because he was seriously channeling Reeve's performance.  As far as Lois, Bosworth was a little on the young side and she didn't bring anything unique to her character, but her performance didn't turn me off either.  The film did bite off a little too much from the first Superman and when it did it one too many times I was irritated.  The Plot...well, all right I didn't understand the master plot.  But Lex Luther and his henchmen obviously were the inspiration to such cartoons like Pinky and the Brain.  What are we going to do tomorrow?  Take over the world.  Speaking of not bringing anything new to the table what happened to Spacey?  He used to bring such chrisma and presence to the screen.  Now it seems like he plays all his characters the same.<br />The main problem with bringing Superman to the table now is...well, we already get our Superman fix in Smallville-which is a pretty darn good show, by the way.  So when I saw the trailer for the movie I didn't want to see it.  I like following my weekly soap from the WB.<br />So what do we have?  A few miscasting and a M.I.A. plot.  And still I was entertained.  Go figure.</p></body></html>

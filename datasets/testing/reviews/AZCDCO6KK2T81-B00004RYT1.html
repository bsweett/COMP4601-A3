<meta name="summary" content="The original "slasher" film still holds up."></head><body><p>"Psycho" still holds up today because of a brilliant script, outstanding performances, top-notch direction, and a host of perfectly aligned elements that produced a masterpiece that is often copied, but never duplicated.<br /><br />This film simply had everything going for it from eerie set designs to a gripping score, and from careful and clever photography to insightful characterizations.  Hitchcock created believable characters that we care about in unbelievable circumstances that scare us because as unbelievable as the situations appear, there is still the element of "yeah, but it could happen."  Sadly, in reality, events like this have happened as much as we so often can't believe the facts when we hear them (anyone remember Jeffery Dalhmer [sp]?).<br /><br />The classic story of "Psycho" takes place mostly at a run-down motel next to a Gothic home that houses a socially inept momma's boy and his clingy demanding mother who sees no woman as good enough for her "boy" seems surreal, but somehow still possible.  This psychological slasher film offers so much more than a lone deranged killer hacking away at unsuspecting victims.  Here Norman Bates, an Oscar worthy performance by Anthony Perkins, falls for Marion Crane, played with great subtly by the stunning Janet Leigh (mother of Jamie Lee Curtis whom she co-starred with in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AM6OQ2">The Fog</a>), who has just robbed her boss and is now having second thoughts and using the Bates Motel to stop and rethink her actions.  Norman's infatuation with Marion disturbs his controlling mother who later "visits" Leigh in one of horrorland's most thrilling and disturbing moments on film.  Clever camera work and inspired direction go with the "less is more" approach that fools us into thinking we are seeing more than we actually are and we are happy to have it that way.<br /><br />What follows is a great psychological thriller/mystery as the first victim's lover, her sister, the local sheriff, and a private detective attempt to figure out just what is going on at the Bates Motel.  While the body count is nothing in comparison to today's slice and dice horror flicks, the killings in this film are nerve-shattering even by today's standards.  The disorienting camera angles enhance every frame of this film that is years ahead of its time.<br /><br />Unlike the slasher films of today with a crazed killer with no real identity to speak of and an even further detachment from reality or plausibility than anything in this film and a series of victims we care even less about than the killer, "Psycho" offers us sadly sympathetic victims and a villain much like the one in "The Phantom of the Opera." We are touched as much as revolted by the killer(s?) in this film.  This is a thriller with surprising depth and insight.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I failed to mention the terrific and all too brief moment with the psychologist in the film played by the always reliable and believable Simon Oakland (Lt. Shrank in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008972S">West Side Story</a> and Kolchak's harried boss in the short-lived TV-series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ATQYWY">Kolchak - The Night Stalker</a>).  You can't help but wish he had more screen time.  He gives a brief but memorable moment in this film that many remember as much as the infamous shower scene.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: The much later sequels during the 1980's, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66Q8I">Psycho II / Psycho III / Psycho IV - The Beginning (Triple Feature)</a>, to this masterpiece are actually not that bad and worth a viewing, including the remake, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IQVC">Psycho</a>, that is a nearly shot for shot repeat of the original only in color and with more contemporary actors for today's audience.  Do any of these films actually hold up in comparison to the original?  Absolutely not, but by themselves and in comparison to most sequels, they are fairly good.</p></body></html>

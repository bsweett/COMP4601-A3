<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies ever made..."></head><body><p>This is another classic from my childhood, it was scary then, and so it is now. Perfect actors were cast for this movie, in fact I doubt the movie Jaws would have been as good as it actually is if it hadn't been for the "dreamtheme" Spielberg, Shaw, Scheider and the wonderful Dreyfuss. I adore these three actors in Jaws, and Spielbergs' directions is the early work of a genious in progress, you know, I find Jaws among Spielbergs' best work ever - the best before Schindlers' List (though very uncomparable) - and the hard work he and his collegues had to put themselves through making the movie (see "The making of..." : Special feautures) was definetively worth all their frustrations until the movie were finally ready for the theatres back in 1975, and in the years after on vcr and then finally on dvd.<br /><br />Jaws is a movie with soul. Unless it would have been old-fashioned long ago. But the action-adventure-thriller-elements behind the story captured on screen are so facinating and impressive and unlike anything else ever made, the effects are "simple" (like the barrels) but function extremely well, and still today - now that we have got all sorts of computer-animated-effect-monsters (call it whatever you want) - what I mean is that "Deep blue sea" (the movie) could never be compared to "Jaws". In my opinion it is too simple, though perhaps twice as expensive as Jaws ever was. And that probably because is a movie much more than just a horror movie about a great white shark. It is more "realistic" - and about a small Island-society turned upside dow and against eachother when the tragedy strikes their usually tourist-season-based beaches, and how the tragedy splits the towns' inhabitans in two sides when the question lingers on wether they should close their beaches and risk their tourist-reputations, or keep them open just for the sake of earning money. Anyway, the movie is still impressive, just as entertaining and loveable.<br /><br />I think Robert Shaw earned an Academy Award for his role in this project, a great actor.</p></body></html>

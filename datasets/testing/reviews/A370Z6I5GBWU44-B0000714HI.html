The main female character in this movie replaces Felicity Shagwell in the previous film, and Mike Myers continues to play the triad of roles of Austin Powers, Doctor Evil, and Fat B------. This film isn't quite as tight as the first one, but it is still entertaining and worth watching if you like Austin Powers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A solid installment finally the way it was meant to be seen."></head><body><p>After part 2, Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) is still on the loose as he's gotten new clothes and murdered a couple of store owners. Rich girl Chris (Dana Kimmell) with prankster Shelly (Larry Zerner), Andy (Jeffery Rogers), Chuck (David Katims), Vera (Catherine Parks), Debbie (Tracie Savage) and Chili (Rachel Howard) are having a sexual holiday at a cottage by the lake called Higgins Haven. Chris unfortunately remembers two years ago that she was attacked by Jason Voorhees but luckily survived and has now returned back to the place to get rid of her bad memories, however the vicious maniac wants blood including hers.<br /><br />A Gory and solid entry of the way too cool Friday The 13th franchise! This is the movie that finally gave Jason a mask and it's his trademark hockey mask that established him. Steve Miner who directed part 2 does a superb job on this entry with scares, shocks, graphic gore like a guy getting his head crushed until his eye pops out, and of course decent acting. I think this one really brings the series growing high and made a big enough fortune in August 13 of 1982 and did a nice job of giving us Jason in his hockeymask and the ending is quite scary as well.<br /><br />This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with only one extra which is a theatrical trailer and of course for the first time in 27 years the original 3D version of the film complete with two pairs of 3D glasses and the 2D version.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>I was surprised at how much I liked this film.  The manic slightly claustrophobic anxiety to the whole thing.  Nicole Kidman is an actress I enjoy because of her versatility and the fact that she always seems to have something going on underneath her performances.  Like someone who is intelligent but may be too wrapped up in one focus.  Thats how several of her performances have struck me.  Which is a good thing.  Conveying both intelligence and life of character as well as a sub-mood is very skilled.  The twist here again is that her and her family are ghosts who haven't accepted death, much like the Sixth Sense but this movie goes a little further in the characters being disturbed.<br />I think that there tends to be a trend in consciousness or idea-streams in movies.  Lately it's been about consciousness---The Sixth Sense, the Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, big movies about the reality of existence, of what is alterable and what isn't.  I read somewhere that Hollywood/films are a projection of teh masses consciousness-------so when there are more violent movies and so on thats what we as a culture are experiencing on a level.  I think this can be seen with the proliferation of war movies and their ilk and at the same time these films about metaphysics, the ones that ask existentialism questions are fascinating as well.  I enjoy them because it does seem like there is challenge to them, a challenge to be more than just cookie cutter films.<br />Also what I will credit this film with is that it completely avoids being gorey, all of the violence is languaged/explained, not shown, which ratchetts up the tension even more.  We've all seen the horror pics of blood and gore, but psychological tension is much harder to create and maintain and pull off satisfyingly.</p></body></html>

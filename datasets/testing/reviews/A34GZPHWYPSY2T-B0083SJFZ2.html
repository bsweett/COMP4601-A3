Though we cannot get out to the theater anymore, I waited endlessly to see this 2010 version.<br /><br />This film is fun, no doubts there. Fun in every way, subtle in its humor, light on the gross violence - and Sam Worthington as Perseus is the casting glory of the century. That man is one gorgeous hunk, and you never feel he's Hollyphony like Russell Crowe or Mel Gibson (who is Hollyloony). His understated, sweet performance as Perseus-I'm-Just-A-Regular-Greek-Man totally blasts Mark Hamil's original Perseus to the stars.<br /><br />Aside from the idiot 3D craze - CLASH OF THE TITANS has been visually ruined by it as have many other films - it is in itself murky and difficult to watch at times. The beginning drags like my mother-in-law's caboose, a yawner right out of the original DUNE. Too much yapping ... like my reviews.<br /><br />The basic stuff of the film is awesome. I was very smitten with the Djinns, and had it not been for the double pleasure of the beautiful Worthington and the equally beautiful Nicholas Hoult (A SINGLE MAN, see my review) as Eusebius, I'd have been in love with them. Desert sorcerers, cool! Oil drillers need those guys.<br /><br />The CGI was a bit of a yawn. From Hades' HARRY POTTER black smoke to Gorgon Medusa's face, the CGI frankly sucked. How could they do this movie, at an hour and a half, and still fail the CGI? CGI, as I always say, can be the crowning glory or the undoing of a film. Here it is the undoing, sadly. We were so busy saying how bad it was, I had to go back later for a second viewing to catch the action and dialogue.<br /><br />The cinematography was somewhat amateurish - the live action scenes are mostly shot in a little box of a stage, I know. That, plus bad CGI, is no good combination. It shows terribly here, and I think it takes a lot away from this otherwise great film. What a pity. It's like Eusebius being turned to stone by Medusa.<br /><br />Pete Postlethwaite as Perseus' adopted father is brilliant and wonderful. The whole cast, which I will not list here, is great! That is why I'm so angered by the technical crapola this film dishes out so carelessly. I will add, Liam Neeson as Zeus, all three minutes of him, is the coolest thing I've seen in ages!<br /><br />What I do love about this film is its theological message (yes, it does have one). It's the old query: Where is the Spirit in the Sky when we need it? Why are we forsaken? Why pray, why did my fields dry up and my island sink a few feet? It emphasizes the gods' need for our prayers, yet they are so stingy and cruel to us. It's a powerful message not conveyed in the 1981 film. It has a double meaning: the end of the old Greek pagan world and the beginning of, I don't know, maybe Judaic monotheism.<br /><br />This is an excellent film for kids, I think. They should see this and know its historical context, its meanings for the people who first heard the tales. Just be ready to get them eyeglasses prescriptions when they are done watching this.</p></body></html>

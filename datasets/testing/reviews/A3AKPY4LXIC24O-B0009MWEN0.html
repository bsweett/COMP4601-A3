<meta name="summary" content="The Only Good Bug is a Dead Bug!"></head><body><p>Starship Troopers is a must see movie for any fan of Science Fiction or Insecticide!  Extremely bloody, insanely hokey, this film should not in any  way be taken seriously.  Although the storyline does have some serious  elements (playing up the power of propaganda) it mostly does one thing, and  that is:  It Makes You Hate Bugs!  Put aside all the naziesque  similarities, the only over all message I got was that in any war, the  enemy is nothing but an enemy.  And it's either me or them.  It sure as  hell isn't gonna be me!  <p>The special effects were what made the movie,  it's just as good on mute as it is with the sound blaring.  Pure eye candy  fun.  The gore is probably what limited this movie's success at the box  office, but it's only a movie!  The bugs aren't real!  And my weren't those  body parts realistic!  Throw in Denise Richards and you can't go wrong!  Paul Verhoeven is definitely a misunderstood genius and this movie proves  it.  An all out testosterone/adrenaline cocktail that you'll watch again  and again.  If you haven't seen it yet just buy it, there's no point in  renting it unless you like throwing away money.  This is a solid video  purchase for any home collection.  Especially if you have any insect  phobias!</p></body></html>

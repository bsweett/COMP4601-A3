<meta name="summary" content="Welles brilliantly cynical slice of Americana remains ageless..."></head><body><p>Welles really pulled off a bravado act of filmmaking with this, his first film, and it's full of humor and sarcasm and, above all, brilliant flourishes of imagery throughout (the gates of Xanadu, News on the March, marriage on the rocks, opera from above, that iconic sled and ceilings).  It's one of many studies on the abuse of power and the souring of the American dream, and while it's not even Welles most shattering, it's definitely among the most refreshing; few films since have been able to dramatize events with such intelligence.  Subsequent viewings can constantly offer up new riches for movie lovers everywhere.  It's one of the few films that potently exemplifies Americana to the world.  Intellectual exploitation of the highest order; lasting proof of Welles genius, and an astounding first film by anyone, anywhere, ever!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Movie~ One of the Best of the Year!"></head><body><p>I loved "Big Fish." Next to "The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King" it was one of the quickest movies that I have ever seen, and also one of the movies that I did not want to end. This movie had so much to like, that a shorter list would be the list of things that were bad about it.  I saw "Big Fish" in Manhattan while it was still in limited release, and now I am waiting to see it again when it expands. And don't listen to the MPAA rating. This movie should have been rated PG- it is not good for all audiences. but certainly for children with there parents. <p>Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom. Bloom likes to tell the many stories of his life, but his stories are false, and he says that they are real, much to the dismay of his son Will, who wants to find out who his father really is, and what happened in his past. Will may get that chance, however, when Edward's wife Sandra calls him and tells him that his father is dying. Will goes to his parents house right away with his preganant wife Josephine, where Will demands to know who his father is. Over the course of Will's visit, we the veiwer hear about Edward's stories. We hear the story of how he and his childhood friends went into the house of a "witch" who supposdly has an eye that if you look into it, you find out how you die. We hear the story about Edward's meeting with a giant named Karl. He then leaves the town that he grew up in, and while attending a circus he finds his true love. In a special shot where everything freezes where it was, including things that are in mid-air, we see Edward meeting Young Sandra. The owner of the circus makes a deal with him. For every month that Edward works for him, he will get one piece of infomation about Sandra. But my favorite story is the story about the famed poet Norther Winslow. It comes up so fast, and it's so hilarious because it's the last thing that you would expect happen. Winslow is played by Steve Buscemi, who is a brilliant actor who you see everywhere. You've probally seen him in "Ghost World", "Big Daddy", "Fargo," and many other films. <p>Tim Burton directed "Big Fish" and I can't think of another director that could have made this movie perfectly. The man who produced "The Nightmare Before Christmas," and "James and the Giant Peach." If you are a fan of Tim Burton, you'll love "Big Fish." It is filmed in the usual Burton style. It is a strange movie, but very realistic. It is hilarious at times, and then full of heart at others. The only other movies that came out this fall that contained those elements were "Something's Gotta Give," and "Matchstick Men," but the stories from all three of these movies combined are complety different and have nothing to do with the other, except for the elements that create the genre. "Big Fish," was simply a great movie, and it is a movie that I have never seen anything like. Even the acting was brilliant. I really like Ewan McGregor. I liked him in "Moulin Rouge," I liked him in "Down with Love," I liked him the last two Star Wars movies, and I liked him in "Big Fish." All of the other cast members were great but I do think that McGregor deserves an Oscar nod for this. If "Big Fish" was nominated for an Oscar, I believe that it has a strong chance of winning. I really hope this review makes it to amazon so I could stress the fact to people that "Big Fish" is one of the best movies of the year. <p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for a fight scene, some images of nudity and a suggestive reference. <p>Big Fish is also one my top 25 list. Just look through my lists and you'll find that list.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Entertainment"></head><body><p>By far, the most impressive thing about the Fantastic Four is the special effects. This is a movie that could not look this good a decade ago. The Fantastic Four has always been placed on hold for being made of a movie because any attempt to make The Thing or Flame would have been laughable. The Flame, I thought, needed a bit more work but The Thing was awesome and totally realistic.<br /><br />The Thing, played by Michael Chiklis, also carried the heart of the movie. You see through his eyes how gaining superpowers isn't always the easiest thing in life. You can easily understand the problems he has adapting to his new abilities as he is chosen to decide living a life being different to help other or living the old life he had before where he was basically like everybody else. His motivations throughout the movie were the easiest to follow.<br /><br />His best friend, Reed Richards (played by Ioan Gruffudd), I wish had more screentime. There were really only a couple of scenes where you saw his new-found power put to work. But the stretching looked realistic whenever he got to do it.<br /><br />The real entertainment of the show came from Johnny Storm (Chris Evans). He was just a real fun and charismatic character to watch on screen and is the only person who really provided any comedy relief.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment in the show was Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon). I just did not get his character. I didn't understand his motivation at all except that he apparently just wanted to do bad things. Why? Well, that is never fully explained. Or explained at all. He just seems upset with some of the things life handed him and decides he needs to start killing people. He gains nothing from it, but insists on doing it anyways. Marvel has done such a great job with the likes of Spiderman and X-Men in showing the motivation of "bad evil doers", I'm surprised to see them make Dr. Doom.<br /><br />I also loved the uniforms of the Fantastic Four. They weren't really that far away from the comic book, except the four on their uniforms was updated (and shrunk a little bit). It gave them a more modern, less baseball jersey look. I was a big fan of the comic but I didn't complain about the costume changes.<br /><br />I found the movie entertaining and well worth watching. I hope a sequel is in the works!<br /><br />The DVD extra features were okay, including the standard couple of deleted scenes and behind the scene look at things. But I was totally fascinated by the brief look at X-Men three coming out next year.</p></body></html>

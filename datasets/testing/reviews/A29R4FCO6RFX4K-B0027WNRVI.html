<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing"></head><body><p>Ok, so THE MUMMY was fun, and MUMMY RETURNS was intermittingly enjoyable despite some obvious flaws, and VAN HELSING looked set to be an impressive CGI-fest with heaps of fast-paced action and Saturday night popcorn fun.<br />It delivers on its promise for action, there are some great set-pieces and the special effects are great, but the cold hard fast is that Stephen Sommers isn't a very good director. Like Jan DeBont and McG, Sommers is one of those types that likes to throw in as much visuals as humanly possible and BAM! A great movie. Problem is, it doesn't always work. Richard Roxburgh's bad-accented Count Dracula is overly-camp, and while Hugh Jackman is seemingly doing something different, he's really just redoing his Wolverine shtick: Shady guy who dispenses ample amounts of violence and one-liners along with obligatory memory problems. Overall, not bad, just not very good either. Next time Mr. Sommers, can we have a bit more story please?</p></body></html>

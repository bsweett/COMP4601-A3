<meta name="summary" content="Hitch A Ride On This Love Story"></head><body><p>If you look at any of my other reviews, you'll see that I'm no "love story, chick flick wus." So there's my disclaimer. And there's your disclaimer. You can say: "some guy [(me)] on Amazon said, 'buy this flick; it's cool; it's not a chick flick; it's awesome entertainment for us macho, cool dudes.'"<br /><br />Hitch is better than a lot of the "trying-to-be-macho-but-really-a-chick-flick" films that I've rented or purchased in the past several years.<br /><br />Funny. Serious. Amusing. Witty. And, hey, I think I'll try some of the pick-up lines that Will Smith executes so flawlessly in this movie.  HEY! OUCH!  (That was my wife smacking me upside the head.)<br /><br />Overview: Will Smith teaches guys "that need help" how to get the girl of their dreams. Will finds his own "challenge", and the comedy of Will and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; acquiring their respective women makes for an awesomely realistic, modern day (macho!) love story.<br /><br />This flick is a keeper. Do you like movies in the vein of "Shallow Hal"? Then this is a movie for you.<br /><br />Hit the Add To Cart Button...if you're macho.</p></body></html>

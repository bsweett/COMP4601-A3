From start to finish, Mann's direction doesn't miss a beat and for a two-hour long film, his pacing remains consistent. I never looked at my watch to see how long I've been in the theater from the moment the film began. Even in The Return of the King I glanced down at my watch once or twice.<br /><br />When it was first announced that Tom Cruise will be starring in Collateral many thought right away that he will be the good guy character. It was quite a surprise to most once they heard that he was going to be the villain instead. Even the announcement that Jamie Foxx was cast in the good guy role instead didn't do much to lessen the impact of Cruise being cast as the heavy. Whatever reservations people might have had about Tom Cruise pulling off being a villain in a film should stop worrying.<br /><br />Tom Cruise pulls it off and I must say that this has to be the best work he's done since Magnolia. That's how good Cruise was in Collateral. His portrayal of the assassin Vincent is excellent. I always thought that just beneath the veneer of Cruise's million-dollar megawatt smile existed a darker side. Cruise lets this darker side of his personality come out and shine from beginning to end. His Vincent was calm, collected, charismatic and most of all sociopathic. His character was indifferent as to whether what he was committing was good or bad. Or whether the reasoning behind it was right or wrong. Vincent was indifference personafied. To him it all boils down to the job he had to perform. It was just something he was well-adept and well-versed in performing. Like how Jamie Foxx's character Max was good in how he drove a taxicab.<br /><br />Speaking of Jamie Foxx, he held his own in every scene that he had with Cruise. His Max character represented the Everyman and his work in this film shows just how underrated and underappreciated a dramatic actor he's become. His reactions to the events that unfolded once he took Vincent's fare seems genuine. He reacted like how most people would probably react when they find out that an assassin has now become their bosom buddy for the night. There's real chemistry between Cruise and Foxx. It is this chemistry that holds the film together from start to finish.<br /><br />Collateral was not so much an excellent crime-thriller, but a study of the missed oppurtunities people have in their lives. OF people not living up to their dreams. Always putting off their dreams until the right time came along. Until one day they've realized that their dream has passed them by and that they've become just one of the millions who end up going through life anonymous and forgotten. Vincent lives every day as if it might be his last, but at the same time he's still fears of becoming one of those anonymous millions. His fear is ironic for the reason that his chosen profession he has chosen to remain anonymous if he is to survive. Max on the other hand spends the entire film going through a forced self-discovery of what he's done with his life and dreams. As an audience we're there to see Max go through this journey of self-discovery from beginning to end.<br /><br />For filmgoers who'll be going in to see Collateral hoping to see some action and violence won't be disappointed. There's violence in this film. When it arrives its sudden, quick and brutal. The violence in this film was very similar to the way the swordfighting in Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman was handled. There's no slow-motion gimmicks or overextended shoot outs. When a gun was pulled out and used there was a reasoning to it. This film had no extraneous scenes of violence for the sake of having it onscreen.<br /><br />Overall, Michael Mann's film was an great example of how a thriller can be made intelligently and without using tricks, gimmicks and misdirection. Collateral could've been just about two guys talking inside a cab and it probably still have succeeded. Its refreshing to know that great direction, great acting, and a flawless script could still be found in Hollywood to create an excellent film.</p></body></html>

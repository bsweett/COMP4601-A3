<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Commentary on Heroes and Modern Warfare"></head><body><p>Set in the Iraq War, the movie is based on first hand observations of Mark Boal, who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq.<br /><br />The story focuses on Staff Sergeant James, (Jeremy Remer) head of an elite squad of soldiers with a mission to protect and save by disarming bombs of all kinds.  It is not easy and the war zone is full of terrorists, assassins, suicide bombers homemade/improvised bombs.<br /><br />In 2004, Staff Sergent James takes over the squad after they lost their team leader on a mission.  When James takes over he does not follow the military rules and protocol.  He gets the job done and is recognized as "wild" by a superior who asks how many bombs he has disarmed.  The only part of the movie that did not ring true was when he said "843 bombs disarmed"  - that did not seem realistic, when the margin of error is zero and the variety of bombs.  The bomb team has only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq and the count-down of days on the screen show situation after ungodly situation where their lives are a hair breath away from death.  The movie holds your attention with deep emotional intensity and action packed scene after scene.  We finally come to understand why Jeremy flirts with death - to feel alive.  A regular life is boring and unmeaning to him.<br /><br />The filming is realistic and it clearly shows the hot, dry, dreary, primitive conditions the soldiers deal with.  The rigors of fighting a half world away, far from the luxuries of home are clearly defined.  After watching you respect even more the psychological, physical and human sacrifice American soldiers face.</p></body></html>

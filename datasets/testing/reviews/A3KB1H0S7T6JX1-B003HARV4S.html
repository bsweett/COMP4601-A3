<meta name="summary" content="19th Century Austria"></head><body><p>The Illusionist brings to the screen the love story between the son of a furniture maker and a daughter of Austrian aristocracy. It is 19th century Austria and two kids fall in love only to be forcefully separated by those who see the relationship as "unfitting." Nevertheless, the two lovebirds' paths cross again only this time the young lady is betrothed to the heir of the Austrian throne...<br />In short, it is a great setting with an interesting plot/storyline and with a predictable political agenda consisting of not-so-hidden messages for which the writers and director are responsible.<br />The not-so-hidden politics behind the movie has to do with the presence (of course!) of the evil European. What a coincidence that Abramowitz-Eisenheim is the "good guy" while the Germanic Austrian royalist and heir to the throne is the villain; very original indeed...<br />Aside from the not-so-subtle and not-so-hidden political agenda, the movie does a good job of providing a fairly generous dose of entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Innovative Film That''s Always Fun To Watch"></head><body><p>This is one of the more inventive movies of the last 10 years, I would think. It was new, fresh and very different when it came out in the late '90s and still is unique and enjoyable as of this review in early 2009.  The Blu-Ray edition, by the way, is terrific and worth the money. It looks tremendous.<br /><br />The movie is short - 81 minutes - but plenty long when you consider it's three versions of the same story, each version about 25 minutes after an opening introduction.<br /><br />That may sound too repetitive or boring for those who haven't seen this, but it is anything but overplayed thanks to the innovative camera-work and interesting angles on the same story. Watching it on DVD was better than the theater because the 5.1 sound is superior, plus you have the option of a good dubbed version or the original German with English subtitles. I use either, depending on my mood but I lean toward the German with subtitles.<br /><br />Franke Potente, who has since gone on to become better known around the world from the "Bourne" films, is the centerpiece of this film and very, very interesting. The looks of shock on her face, her flaming red hair and wild general appearance and the crazy things that happen to her are always fun to watch and hear.<br /><br />Added to the unique cinematography, which includes tricks here and there, is a pulsating electronic soundtrack that brings added life to this already kinetic, involving film.<br /><br />The high rating I give this film could really be summed up in two words: DIFFERENT and FUN.</p></body></html>

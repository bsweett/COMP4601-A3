No one understands obsession and madness quite like he does and in Timothy Treadwell he has found a perfect subject. One imagines, at first, a well-meaning introvert more at home in nature than in society. What emerges is a descent into madness and delusion played out in high stakes gaming before a spectacular natural backdrop.<br /><br />Treadwell sees himself as defender, protector, and advocate for these wild and often vicious behemoths who, ironically, are already being defended and protected in a National Park. As Herzog demonstrates, Treadwell created an elaborate mythology about himself, one major lie is that he was alone - for much of the time he wasn't. As the movie develops Treadwell's rants become increasingly shrill and desperate as he labors to convince himself and us that his uninformed and pointless dare-devil antics actually have meaning.<br /><br />We can be awed by his insane recklessness but to think that he contributed anything, as he claimed, is ludicrous. Maybe Treadwell swapped his addiction to booze for an addiction to adrenaline. He certainly didn't help the bears any, indeed, he did them a disservice. What makes this film so fascinating is how accurately Herzog captures Treadwell's many personas. Treadwell was quite literally the writer, director, producer, star, (and in an odd way also audience), for his own movie, carefully manipulating and deceiving viewers. If there is anyone who is surprised by his fate just remember that he choreographed it painstakingly and when it arrived probably greeted it with something resembling religious ecstasy.</p></body></html>

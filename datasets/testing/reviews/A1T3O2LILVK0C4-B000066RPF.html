<meta name="summary" content="Monty Python and Medieval Mockery"></head><body><p>In 1974 the bad boys of British comedy decided to create a full-length motion picture, which was destined for greatness (or at least mediocrity disguised as greatness). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F6LQ">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a> is a totally distasteful classic of almost epic proportions.<br />The film stars John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Terry Gilliam, who not only acts but also serves as the film's co-director and animator. Each member of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GEIRSM">Monty Python</a> is perfect in their (dis)respective roles, but standing out from the others is the late Graham Chapman, who plays King Arthur as the "straight character". Chapman portrays Arthur as a serious, heroic figure who is completely unaware of his self-satirizing surroundings.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRQX34">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a> begins with a series of gags involving mock-Swedish subtitles and of all things, moose and llamas. After some of the strangest credits ever, the first scene opens on an epic shot of the mist-shrouded moors of medieval Britain. Two men come galloping heroically into view. What's odd is that neither of them are on horses. In fact, one of them is simply banging two halves of a coconut shell together to simulate the sound of hoof beats. Thus hilarity ensues. The story also includes such memorable characters as an obnoxious French "taunter", a three-headed knight, an effeminate prince who just wants to sing, a ghastly cartoon monster, and perhaps the most lethal rabbit ever put on film.<br /><br />What makes the film so bloody funny is the complete lack of respect that it shows to Arthurian legend and medieval folklore. Both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (the dementedly brilliant directors and co-stars) are quite familiar with medieval history and delight in lampooning it at every turn. The dialogue is perfectly ridiculous and that's precisely what makes it so entertaining.<br />I won't go into great detail about the plot (ha-ha-ha!) or the innumerous zany characters other than to say it's absolutely irreverent and mad (something that seems common with the Pythons). Even the ending of the film is intentionally anti-climactic.<br />But if you want British comedy without restraint, then check out this classic or, "I'll wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of secondhand, electric-donkey bottom biters!"<br />Oh, and don't forget your coconuts.<br /><br />The 2-disc Special Edition includes the following special features: an audio commentary by directors and stars Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, an audio commentary by John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin, Follow the Killer Rabbit feature, Subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film (taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part II), On-Screen Screenplay, three Sing-Alongs, The Quest for the Holy Grail documentary, BBC Film Night: On Location with Monty Python and the Holy Grail vintage featurette, two scenes from the Japanese language version of the film, How to Use Your Coconuts instructional featurette, Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego short film, extensive image galleries, An Interactive Cast Directory, and theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312311451">The Pythons: Autobiography</a> by The Pythons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XRZ92">The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: 16 Ton Megaset</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767827724">And Now for Something Completely Different</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OKQK">Jabberwocky</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VE439Y">Monty Python's Life of Brian</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A0MFJ">Monty Python's The Meaning of Life</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011E5M66">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a></p></body></html>

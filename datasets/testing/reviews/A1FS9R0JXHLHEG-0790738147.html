Confidential would have been a sure-fire Academy Award Best Picture winner. The best parts of the movie are Kim Basinger in an Oscar winning performance for her role as a Veronica Lake lookalike hooker and Russell Crowe as a fearsome cop who finds a surprising capacity for love.<p>The genius of the film is the three inter-related stories (hookers cut to resemble movie stars, missing heroin and a murder investigation) in LA of the early 1950's. Cops, prostitution, corrupt politicians and gangsters all touch each others lives and in the tabloid press in surprising ways.<p>The acting is terrific with James Cromwell, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pierce and Danny DeVito all selling their souls for ambition - and the price to be paid; deserved or not. The costumes and set design are first rate. If you like film noir, or just love well-crafted movies you'll have to look hard to find a better film.</p></body></html>

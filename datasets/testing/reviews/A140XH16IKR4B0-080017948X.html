But "Groundhog Day" was a great Bill Murray film - with a moral even!<br /><br />Murray plays a weatherman Phil Connors on a local Pennsylvania TV station who is assigned to do an on-the-scene standup. To his dismay, it is at unveiling of Punxatony Phil - the groundhog who predicts whether spring is imminent or 6 weeks away. Phil is a narcissistic twit, who feels the assignment is beneath him. But his snarkiness is put on hold when he gets the hots for on-location producer Rita (Andy McDowell). Andy is a very nice lady who sees right through Murray. No chance the two of them will end up together.<br /><br />A blizzard forces an overnight stay. But when Phil wakes up, he discovers that it is still February 2! It takes Phil several cycles to really believe that he is reliving precisely the same day. AT which time he does what every egomaniac would do: he tries to takes advantage of this situation. He scores with attractive women (after learning their likes and dislikes in previous lives), and otherwise tries to enrich himself. But Rita, his real quarry, is nowhere near his net.<br /><br />Telling more would ruin the film. Suffice it to say that Phil gets tired of his repetitive victories, and undergoes a Scroogelike metamorphosis. Kudos to writer/producer Harold Ramis for sneaking this cute morality take onto our radar. And for making it real. Which of us, when realizing, in a dream, that we are dreaming, does not try to use that knowledge for self-gratification of self-improvement? Ramis has taken that common experience and run it to it logical conclusion. A terrific film with brains, heart and soul.</p></body></html>

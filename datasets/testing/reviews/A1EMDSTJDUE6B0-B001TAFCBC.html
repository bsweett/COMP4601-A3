You might have to force yourself to get through the first 15 or 20 minutes, but then things pick up and fall into place. It is a little like "Memento" and others of that genre. Not too predictable. Carrey is at one of his finest points, which surprised me. Questionable for dates, but good movie for (stable) couples.</p></body></html>

But when watching it you watch a bunch of humans find a place buried 100's of feet below ground and end up stuck in there as a war between the Aliens and the Predators begins. But the stupid thing is, the first half is setting up the charactors, then the next half they have been killed off before you've blinked and it's just focused on one person, one Predator and there partnership. (They may as well have given her and the Alien a love scene to put the nail in the coffin)<br /><br />There was too much charactor development to just off everybody suddenly and focus on the warriors from another world. The ending was completly predicted and it revealed nothing memorable or worth remembering.<br /><br />How does this crap end up with a sequel? "we screwed up the first time, where gonnah try again, we only have have half a script, lets shoot it already" (another flop in the making)</p></body></html>

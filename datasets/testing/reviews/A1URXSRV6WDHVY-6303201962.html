I have watched this movie more than 100 times since it's release in 1982 and it just keeps getting better with time.  So many quotable lines for Trek fans too.  There is nothing I do not like about this movie.  On this special edition you do get a few extra and extended scenes.  The die hard purist in me thinks they interfere somewhat with the pacing, but hearing Spock say "Fascinating" (in a comic drone) after Kirk tells him about his son is priceless.  The included extras are all very cool.  Personally I would have wished for a bit more about the making of the special effects but even THAT part is pretty darn good!  Ace direction by Nicholas Meyer, and simply THE BEST score EVER for a Star Trek movie by James Horner help make The Wrath of Kahn the de facto standard for Star Trek movies and one that STILL has not been topped!  The price is so low they are giving it away and the dvd transfer is top notch.  You can NOT go wrong with this film!</p></body></html>

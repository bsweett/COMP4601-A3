While not unusually "graphic," it is unusually disturbing.  The creators have gone out of their way to concoct disquieting deaths and some pretty disquieting ideas.  It's the kind of movie where at the end you have to kinda wonder what kind of sick mind came up with this stuff.<br /><br />If you liked SE7EN, you might like this too.  That's the movie it's most often compared with, but that's not quite fair.  It's seedy, like much of SE7EN, but it doesn't have a Hollywood gloss on it. For all it's deranged ideas, SE7EN had a sheen of respectability brought to it by the presence of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow...all comfortable, well-known, attractive actors.  Not much of that in SAW!<br /><br />It deals with a serial-killer who isn't really.  The crazy person in this film concocts extremely elaborate ways to get his hostages to kill themselves.  One victim, for example, is told she can save herself by unlocking the huge device on her head, which, when a timer goes off, will essentially rip her head in half.  To unlock the device, she must retrieve the key from her cellmate.  Or rather, her cellmate's stomach.<br /><br />The killer watches all the shenanigans from lots of hidden cameras and such, and communicates in taped recordings that distort his voice.  We've seen all that sort of stuff before.  The cop who is chasing the bad guy (Danny Glover) is obsessed with his work, to the point where his sanity loosens and he loses his job.  Hardly original either.<br /><br />What DOES work in the film is the central scene (which feels almost like a play) where two men wake up in a most horrifically filthy abandoned public restroom somewhere.  They are chained around the ankle to thick pipes and cannot reach each other.  In the middle of the room lies a previous victim, a man who has apparently shot  himself in the head and left quite a mess on the floor.  Each man discovers a taped recording with instructions, telling them how to survive.  The main character, played by Cary Elwes (oh, how far the star of PRINCESS BRIDE has fallen), is a doctor who has been told that his wife and daughter are being held hostage, and that they can only have there freedom if Elwes kills his cellmate.  Oh, and each man has a hacksaw...not strong enough to cut the chains, but perfect for sawing off a foot to get free of the chains.  Nice, huh?<br /><br />Well, I have to admit that as the men acted out their little scenario throughout the film (the rest of the backstory is told in flashbacks) I was intrigued.  It carried a lurid fascination.  And the resolution of the film, while a bit pat, was surprising and twisty.  We think we know who the villain is...but do we?<br /><br />So, the pluses are there:  it's a compelling story (although we feel a little unclean watching it), has some surprises and has an over-the-top art direction and cinematography that is admirable in its fearlessness.<br /><br />On the down side: the acting is pretty uneven.  Glover really has nothing to work with and poor Elwes...in the past, he has done an American accent quite convincingly, but in this movie, it gets away from him time and again...lapsing into British pronunciations just enough to be quite distracting.  The young man who is the doctor's cellmate is played by screenwriter Whannel, and he comes across as a guy who's maybe done a little acting in college for fun...he's got energy, but no subtlety.  Monica Potter plays Elwes wife, and she's a cipher too.  The movie isn't terribly interested in its characters...just its situations.  And for the most part, that's good enough.  This is no SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  If the filmmakers aspired to that...they missed the boat.  If they aspired to achieve everything that the execrable FEAR DOT COM missed, then I think they did okay.  The movie shows some originality, but it feels a bit rushed.  No doubt the filmmakers were given a pretty tight budget and schdule.  Parts of it feel scotch-taped together...tug too hard and it'll all fall apart.  You don't want to think about this one too hard.<br /><br />Who to recommend it to:  filmgoers who don't mind being a little uncomfortable in exchange for some serial-killer / sicko thrills.  If you like stuff like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SE7EN and that ilk, you'll probably be okay with this film.  If you're squeamish, like your murders tidy, then stay away.  And again, if you're a parent, please keep your young kids away.  When I saw the film, there were about 10 little children in the audience, and I felt bad for them.  They'll remember (and dream about) the disturbing images...but won't actually understand what happened.</p></body></html>

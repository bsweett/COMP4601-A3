<meta name="summary" content="An OK story with a fantastic sound track"></head><body><p>Any excuse to feature Beatles music is usually worthwhile, but Across the universe is an mediocre picture wrapped in a psychedelic anti-war wet dream.<br /><br />The picture has it's moments, the Character of Jude is excellent and well played by Jim Sturgess who next to the music is clearly the best thing about the picture.  The integration of the Beatles music in the picture works very well and the various musical numbers are really well choreographed, and the first 20 minutes of the picture are the strongest plotwise.<br /><br />Unfortunately besides that there is little else to recommend.  The actual performances are not to blame, most are at least passable but yet another attempt to make a "statement" movie on Iraq=Vietnam just doesn't do it.  This movie on a 45 Million dollar budget failed to make $30 mil back, that was no accident.  You can feel the self importance of the filmmakers and it can't help but turn you off.<br /><br />I'd recommend the sound track <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UZ4G82">Across the Universe</a> but unless you are a big fan of MSNBC this is a rental, worth seeing once for the musical numbers and Jim Sturgess (who I will look for in other pictures) but other than that, nothing special or important.  In fairness I can't see how the picture could ever be as important as the filmmaker thought it was.</p></body></html>

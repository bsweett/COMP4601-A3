This movie has a lot of bloodshed and bodyparts flying around the place. sorta like a rip off of Natural Born Killers but with vampires and this movie is better then that movie. The cast is great, including George Clooney as Seth Geiko. nice vampire transformations and the feeling of the intense horror they all had to endure.<p>Seth(Clooney)-&quot; psychos do not explode when sunlight hits them, I dont give a **ck how crazy they are!!!&quot;</p></body></html>

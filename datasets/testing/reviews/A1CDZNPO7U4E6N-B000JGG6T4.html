<meta name="summary" content="Denzel is indeed on FIRE!"></head><body><p>First of all, if I could give this movie more stars I would because it actually deserves 10. Secondly, Denzel has not made being bad look this good "Training Day" which I also loved. I absolutely love Denzel Washington, so I expected no less than a phenomenal movie from him, and I'm glad I wasn't disappointed. "Revenge is a dish best served cold" I couldn't have said it better, and Denzel does indeed serve it up cold and raw. I loved every minute of it, and that includes all the violence that some people seem to hate about. I was rooting for Denzel to kill them all too. In fact, I loved this movie so much that I had to add it to my collection. Let's not forget, Dakota Fanning. This has got to be one of the most talented girls in Hollywood right now, at least for her age anyway. I have to say that I adore her more as an actress than some of these other older newcomers to the big screen. I was also surprised that Marc Anthony exceeded my expectations as an actor. I really underestimated him, but he actually did pretty good though. I would definitely watch this movie again. In fact, I have watched it several times, and will probably watch it several more times.</p></body></html>

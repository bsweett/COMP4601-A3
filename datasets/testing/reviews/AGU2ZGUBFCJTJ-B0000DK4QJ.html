Both had trouble with their last picture with Tom Cruise's Vanilla Sky not meeting expectations and Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence tanking after a decent opening weekend. Whether this is the case or not, both Spielberg and Cruise had read the short story by Phillip K. Dick and did everything in their power to bring the story to life on the big screen. With such a stellar combination and huge marketing buzz to boast, can anything stop this film from breaking the box office bank? How about a little alien? Surprisingly Spielberg and Cruise's dream child may get upset by a genre of film many believed to be on the oust but only long-term time will tell. For now, Minority Report goes head to head with Disney's Lilo & Stitch in a weekend period many thought would be the calm before the Independence Day storm.<p>The story centers on a man who works for the division of pre-crime for the city of Washington D.C. The division of pre-crime is centered on the visions of the three Pre-Cogs, psychics of sorts that predict murders before they take place. It is up to the cop-like pre-crime division team led by Detective John Anderton to stop these acts before the present catches up with the future. And so far it has proven its worth with the absence of murderous acts in the nation's capitol for over six years. But when a hot shot federal agent comes in to take control of the pre-crime department at a time when the nation will vote on whether pre-crime should be allowed, Detective Anderton begins to notice flaws in the system. When he seen in a vision murdering a man he had never met before, he must find a way to change his future in less then 36 hours. The story for Minority Report is probably one of the best that has come from Hollywood in quite some time and we wouldn't expect less from Steven Spielberg. The plot is very intelligent and proves that the summer doesn't have to be just brain-dead, blow `em up action flicks. The biggest surprise comes from the balanced flow of the film considering this was based on a short story.<p>The cast for Minority Report is put together exceedingly well. Tom Cruise has what could be another Oscar worthy performance as Detective John Anderton. Will he get nominated? Not likely since the movie is opening too far ahead of the nominating process but it doesn't he can't be recognized for it. Cruise expresses a wide range of emotions throughout the picture and fits perfectly into the role. Colin Farrell does a pretty good job in the role of Detective Ed Witwer. The only problem is the way his character is killed off near the end of the picture. It is kind of insulting to the character but this isn't a complaint towards Farrell's performance, just toward the story. And Max Von Sydow gives an absolutely wonderful performance as Director Burgess and works well with Tom Cruise all the way to the very end.<p>Overall, Minority Report keeps the audience guessing and running out breath all the way to the very end. The film is definitely the best suspense thriller in summer 2002 if not the best film of the year. Spielberg truly makes up for the mistakes he made in A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Tom Cruise proves to many disbelievers that he can take on such a difficult project with one of the best directors of all time. Though the film is well put together, there are some things to pick at. That would include the film's 2 hour and 25 minute time length, which seemed too long. Portions of the film seemed to really drag especially as the picture neared the end and could have been cut. Another complaint doesn't exactly involve anything that could have been done but the whole thing with Tom Cruise's eyes seemed too much at times. Some of the jokes involving the eyes got a little annoying and could have been left out of the final print. In the end, though, Minority Report achieves everything it was meant to and more. This could definitely be one of the more mature films of the year and works exceedingly well with that.</p></body></html>

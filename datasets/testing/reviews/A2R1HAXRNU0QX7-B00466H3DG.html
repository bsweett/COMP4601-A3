<meta name="summary" content="Sweet, well-acted and surprising."></head><body><p>If by some chance you don't know the basic premise, here it is:  Lacuna Inc has invented a process whereby a person can have their painful memories simply "erased" right from their brains.  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have gone through a painful breakup, and when Carrey discovers Winslet has undergone the procedure, this torments him to the point where he asks to undergo it himself.<p>It almost sounds a little like a sci-fi movie, doesn't it.  But the "technical" elements are REALLY low-tech.  Lacuna Inc (founded by Tom Wilkinson, the brilliant older actor who was so great in IN THE BEDROOM) is located in a shabby office that looks more like it might belong to a second-rate veterinarian or dentist than a cutting-edge innovator.  That little element tells us three things:  1)  the movie was low-budget, 2) it's creators had the humor and good-sense to use the low-budget to their advantage, and 3) Lacuna's process maybe ain't all it's cracked up to be.<p>Charles Kaufman wrote the script (he's the genius behind ADAPTATION and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH), so we know we are NOT in for a linear story.  But I found SUNSHINE to be easier to follow.  Basically, we see Carrey's memories being erased from the most recent to the oldest.  So we start with the crumbling end of the relationship and work backwards to the sweet beginnings.  <p>Somewhere along the way, Carrey decides he doesn't really care to lose these memories, and tries various tricks to "hide" from the erasers.  These moments, which take us on some flights of fancy, are among the most fun in the movie...such as when Carrey escapes with Winslet (or at least the Winslet of  his memories) to his childhood, where he is able to enjoy the simple pleasures of being a baby again...like taking a bath in the sink!  It's the only time of the movie where Carrey breaks into some of his more antic physical work (a la Ace Ventura), but it totally fits the plot and isn't remotely distracting.  Carrey is utterly self-effacing in the movie, and it doesn't feel like a gimmic.  It isn't a "look at me, I'm underplaying!"...it is a fully fleshed out character and Carrey is really good.<p>Winslet is one of my favorite actors and she doesn't disappoint here.  She is a delightful ball of quirky energy.  She is a performer who holds nothing back and has no vanity.  I think this plays well with Carrey, another performer who doesn't hold back.  But it seems to make him feel comfortable with NOT being obnoxious.  And we don't have any phony moments from him, as we sometimes got in THE TRUMAN SHOW. He is finally just ACTING...not "putting on a show." Winslet, I think, makes this possible.<p>The other plot(s) involve the employees of Lacuna.  Mark Ruffalo (endearing) and Elijah Wood (obnoxious) are the two programmers / operators, who come into Carrey's house to erase the memories.  Kirsten Dunst is the administrative assistant in the office, and she's having a fling with Ruffalo.  I won't tell you what Wood is up to...suffice it to see that his character is a little less admirable than Frodo!! All three performers are good, and along with Wilkinson, we've got 6 REALLY solid performances.<p>The film fails to get the full 5 stars (I give it 4.33 out of 5) for two reasons:  1)  Dunst's character does some things near the end of the film which aren't totally believable...they feel just a little like a plot device to make the ending possible.  2)  We see a lot of the end of the Carrey / Winslet relationship, and a lot of the beginning.  Where was the middle?  The "we're very comfortable together, but the passion is abated, but we aren't sick of each other yet" phase.  The movie does such a great job of making us feel the pain / pleasure of love, that I really missed seeing it explore this part of the whole "romance" thing.<p>But, nit-picking aside, I highly recommend this original, touching, sometimes hilarious but always fresh movie.  For adults who've had relationships.  Not for kids.</p></body></html>

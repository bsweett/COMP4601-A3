<meta name="summary" content="excellent 5 star movie ,  inferior one star blu ray transfer."></head><body><p>This is a true classic of the sci fi genre. a five star movie classic,  That being said Warner Brothers made no attempt to clean up the print for the blu ray release.  This was a early release from the studio on the new format. They since have released many flicks with excellent cleaned up pictures. However sony also made this mistake with their release of  the fifth element and then recalled the first edition and put out a proper cleaned up release.  Warner brothers needs to do the same with this one.  Lets just hope that no other movies get released on blu ray with tear and wear lines down the center of the picture. 'caligula' has them too sadly but that's a special case,  Blu ray should never have such poorly done transfers on this format. Even the newer release of this is just the same print. this is lame.  Someone clean this movie up! they fixed 'predator' so why can't they do the same for this and 'robocop"?</p></body></html>

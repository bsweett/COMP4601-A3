Given that, this is still a long movie, clocking in at almost 2.5 hours, without any additional footage separate from the theatrical release.  This film is part action, part suspense, part drama, with a little comedy and romance thrown in.  There is magic, but not so much of it as to overwhelm the plot lines, of which there are several.  First is the quest of Harry and friends to find the Deathly Hollows.  Second is the relationship between Ron and Harry both over Hermione and with regards to each other.  Then comes the separate tragedies of the various wizards and muggles as they fall prey to Voldermort.  Last, but not least, is Voldermort himself, and his quest to find Harry Potter.  Mixed in is a very original and effective retelling of the Deathly Hallows story narrated by Hermione, some key deaths, and further insights into Dumbeldorf's past.  Overall, a great movie and well worth the purchase, especially considering the news that Warner Brothers will remove all the Potter DVD's from store shelfs early 2012.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Film From The Trek Franchise"></head><body><p>A lot of fun is to be had with this installment in the Star Trek movie series. There is nothing like watching people from the future travel back in time to around this time period and try to interact with people of the past. That is exactly what this movie is about as Kirk and the crew go back in time to the late 20th century to retrieve some whales that are extinct in their future. Obviously, this movie is hilarious, which is what is intended. But, this also teaches us a leason that we need to be more careful on what we do now because it does effect our future.<br /><br />The story really does add the comedy touch to what could be considered a serious topic of whale extinction. There are many moments that Trek and non-Trek fans alike can enjoy just because of the fun nature of the entire movie. From Spock swimming with whales to Chekov asking actual people who didn't know they were being filmed where the "nuclear wessels" were. If you are a fan, you have to see this movie. This is a must have once again for anyone who loves great films.</p></body></html>

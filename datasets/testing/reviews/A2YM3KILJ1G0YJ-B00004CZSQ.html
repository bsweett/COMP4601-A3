<meta name="summary" content="Definitely where an Argento newbie should start!"></head><body><p>Suspiria has a very ominous beginning, and great musical score that is not only slightly scary, and used throughout as foreshadowing, but also appropriate for the plot and main character: Suzie, a ballerina traveling from NY to Germany for a dancing scholarship.  Upon arrival to her new academy she encounters an eerie, gruesome murder of a recently expelled student.  Soon thereafter she falls understandably ill after seeing an anonymous, hideous looking woman (picture the offspring of Capt. Lou Albano and an Eastern European bearded-lady carnival worker) who looks after the schoolmaster's creepy, Little Boy Blue nephew.<br /><br />Essentially, the movie breaks down as a mystery; the killer, cause, and source of evil is completely unknown and secretive until the final suspenseful moment.  It's psychotic and seductive, a true horror tale that leaves the exposition as minimal as possible and saturates the senses with prolonged action and climaxes.<br /><br />This is where Argento's reputation is well deserved.  While the story and acting are average, the framing of colors and shadows are wonderful contrasts that can't be avoided; they simply grab a viewer's attention.  The camera angles and scenery are stupendous, with soul piercing close-ups and epic, wide-angle work, each scene is framed with a deliberateness that works perfectly.  At one point a shadow is so masterfully filmed during a chase scene that it appears to be the tormentor or evil entity that seems to be ever-so-elusive in Argento movies.  Brilliant.<br /><br />For those who want to jump into Argento, learn from my mistake and begin with Suspiria; because, Inferno is not where you need to begin.</p></body></html>

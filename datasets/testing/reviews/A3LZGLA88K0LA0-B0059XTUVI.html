<meta name="summary" content="STREEP SHINES IN A DISAPPOINTING MOVIE"></head><body><p>While Meryl Streep deservedly won her third Oscar for her impressive performance as Margaret Thatcher, THE IRON LADY is a disappointing portrait of this historical figure.<br />The script focuses on Thatcher's seeming decline into probable dementia accompanied by hallucinatory conversations with her dead husband (a charming performance by Jim Broadbent) rather than illuminating Thatcher's key political crises.  This is all the more surprising since the director is a woman.<br />Streep is as expected amazing.  There are times it's hard to recognize the actress at all.  THE IRON LADY ultimately emerges as a vehicle for a brilliant performer in a flawed movie.</p></body></html>

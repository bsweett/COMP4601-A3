<meta name="summary" content="Discovering yourself"></head><body><p>"Moon" just entered that long list of movies, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00498VS1E">Alien</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO0LH2">The Island</a>, in which the Evil Corporation treats human material as a consumable. You won't find bam-pow action in this movie. Instead, this thoughtful movie sneaks up on you and opens its secrets to you one by one.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the movies revelations, since plot drives this movie rather than action or effects. Each new discovery unfolds more of the plot, down to a few lines captured from radio broadcasts at the very end.<br /><br />Although somewhat claustrophobic, "Moon" carries itself beautifully. It echoes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NWPY20">Solaris</a> in some ways, but replaces a mysterious external force with an all-too-understandable human one. I recommend this highly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

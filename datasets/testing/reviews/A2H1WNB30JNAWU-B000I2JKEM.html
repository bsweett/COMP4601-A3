<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton outdoes himself"></head><body><p>Tim Burton one of my favorite directors truly outdoes himself with this movie called Corpse Bride Starting Deep and Carter who do lot of Burton films.  The whole story line is deep, dark, at times freaky.  But if you love Tim Burton films then pick this movie up and enjoy the voice over work of Deep and Carter.  I look forward to all Tim Burton films and his creativeness might be twisted and deep dark in his own mind but he makes killer movies time and time again.  If you want a different kind of till death do you part then pick this movie up and enjoy a very good movie for the ages.</p></body></html>

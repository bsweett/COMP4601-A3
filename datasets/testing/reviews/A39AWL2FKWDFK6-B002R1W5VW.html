<meta name="summary" content="Fun flim-flam flick"></head><body><p>The versatile and adept Nicolas Cage is outstanding as obsessive compulsive con man Roy Waller in Matchstick Men.  Cage, chock full of tics and spasms, and his grifting partner Frank, nicely played by Sam Rockwell (Green Mile and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) are small time California operators looking for a big score.  When Cage accidently dumps the medication that keeps him on an even keel down the drain, he freaks out.  Cage takes his partner's advice and sees a shrink.<p>Cage, a divorcee, starts to settle down when he shockingly discovers that he has fathered a now 14 year old daughter.  He opts to meet the girl, well acted by Alison Lohman, who proceeds to make Cage's life a tumultuous mess.  Cage and Lohman actually start developing a close relationship with Cage teaching the girl the tricks of his trade.<p>Ridley Scott, not known for lighter subject matter like this movie does a commendable job directing the film.  The movie proceeds a tad slowly at points but concludes with a blindsiding yet satisfying twist.</p></body></html>

To us, Japan was the enemy, and to Japan, vice versa, so it was sort of interesting to watch the happenings on the other side of things. That said, the movie itself is somewhat on the bland side, especially the first half. Truly not much happened, it was all just a waiting game. When the battles actually begin, it is very intense and graphic. Especially the suicide scenes. Very poignant and true. The acting was very solid throughout. The only gripe I have is with the subtitles. They were somewhat hard to read in certain scenes. Either they were not on the screen long enough, or they were just hard to make out in contrast with the scene background. I do not mind reading subtitles, I just wish they stood out a little better in this film. I don't know how much of this film is historically accurate, but that is difficult to achieve with any war film. But this one is certainly worth watching.</p></body></html>

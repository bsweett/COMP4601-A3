<meta name="summary" content="A Very Powerful Film, but Far From a Masterpiece."></head><body><p>Hotel Rwanda will move you in ways that few films can. It's basically Schindler's List set in Africa, full of intensely frightening moments and the triumphs of the human spirit. Don Cheadle is finally given his first leading role and man does he ever prove himself worthy of being a leading man. While his role isn't as flashy as Jamie Foxx in "Ray" or Leonardo DiCaprio in "The Avaitor" he still achieves the respect from me by his excellent performance here. The main reason I gave this film four stars is that for some reason it didn't quite impact me the way I thought it would. Don't get me wrong, the events are horrifying (especially when you know almost one million people were killed in a matter of months only 10 years ago), but the movie itself didn't have the impact on me like Schindler's List did. I still consider this a film everyone should see at least once, and it's too bad "Sideways" filled the last Best Picture spot for the Oscars rather than this deserving film.</p></body></html>

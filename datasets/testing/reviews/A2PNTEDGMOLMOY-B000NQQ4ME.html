<meta name="summary" content="Unrelenting violence masks Gibson's vibrant recreation of Mayan world"></head><body><p>"Apocalypto" is an easier movie to admire than it is to love.  Mel Gibson utilizes all the tricks of his trade to make an intelligent, thoughtful movie and yet what sticks with you is the over-the-top, unrelenting violence of the film.<br /><br />Set in the 16th century, "Apocalypto" focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization, one of the most fascinating yet ignored cultures in the Western hemisphere.  Jaguar Paw is a young warrior in a jungle tribe of Maya, father to a young boy and waiting for his pregnant wife to bring another son into the world.  The first half-hour of the film focuses on the daily life of Jaguar Paw's tribe, including a realistic tapir hunt and some hilarious scenes from the tribe's daily life.  One of the most refreshing aspects of "Apocalypto" is the movie's willingness to humanize the members of this largely-forgotten culture.<br /><br />The peaceful idyll of the tribe's life comes crashing down after warriors invade the peaceful village looking for slaves.  Men are either killed or taken prisoner, women are raped and then either murdered or taken prisoner, and children are abandoned to their fate.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and young son in a nearby pit, but their lifeline is cut by one of the invaders.  As Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers are marched away in bondage, he vows to return and save his small family.<br /><br />What ensues is a slow march to hell.  The slavers trek through jungle, across mountains, ford mighty rivers, and eventually end up at a massive Mayan city.  Gibson and his team create a nightmare city of wondrous architecture build on the blood of slaves.  This is not the "Gone With the Wind" vision of slavery, with noble slaves toiling more or less willingly on gorgeous pastureland.  "Apocalypto" shows slavery in all its horrors, up close and visceral.<br /><br />For all the city's might, the Mayan city suffers.  Disease and blight plague the city, and the rulers are trying to appease their sun-god with human sacrifices . . . which is the destiny of Jaguar Paw and his friends.  Gibson and his team linger on the morbid scene that is this sacrifice - ritual disembowelment following by ripping out of the beating heart of the victim, followed by decapitation.  While this is a scene of undeniable power, feel free to keep a napkin handy for the retching that may ensue.<br /><br />A solar eclipse temporarily saves Jaguar Paw's life and provides him the opportunity to escape back to save his family.  "Apocalypto" then turns into a long chase scene as the slavers hunt Jaguar Paw.  Again, these scenes are beautiful and powerful in their way, but again the unrelenting violence becomes a bit much as the body count continues to rise in various gruesome ways.<br /><br />The climax of "Apocalypto" is complex and unsettling.  Jaguar Paw may (or may not) win out in the end, but don't look for an equivalent of Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star here.  The title of the movie is appropriate, after all.<br /><br />Gibson has made an admirable movie with "Apocalypto" that will satisfy both action fans and history buffs.  Unfortunately, the violence quotient is so high that the most likely repeat viewers of "Apocalypto" are the same folks who delight in the recent spate of torture movies, such as "Hostel" or "The Devil's Rejects."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Underappreciated "Hulk" That's Worth Your Time"></head><body><p>This 2008, interesting "re-boot" of the Marvel Comics character comes across as a sequel to an origin movie that was never made!<br /><br />Pretending that Ang Lee's interesting but bonkers "Hulk" movie never happened, director Louis Leterrier's colorful comic-book saga brings us a kinder, more identifiable Bruce Banner in the form of Edward Norton. Intentionally channeling the Bill Bixby series more than its predecessor, this "Hulk" finds Banner on the run in South America, still trying to find a cure for his transformations into the Big Green One. Circumstances, of course, get in the way, with the military -- including General Ross (William Hurt) -- in hot pursuit of Banner, going so far as to send a newly Gamma-infused soldier (Tim Roth) into the fray in order to stop the Hulk from causing further damage. Banner, meanwhile, seeks help from old love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), who hasn't spoken to her military dad since Banner's accident, as well as a scientist (Tim Blake Nelson) who hopes to provide a serum to help our hero at least control his transformations.<br /><br />Loaded with effects and chase sequences, this "Incredible Hulk" is a lot more faithful in spirit and execution to the Marvel Comics -- as well as the old CBS series -- than its predecessor, no question. In-jokes and references for fans abound, from a quote of Joe Harnell's series theme to Lou Ferringo's cameo and vocal performances of the Hulk's dialogue as well (there's no mistaking Big Lou's "Hulk SMASH!" line). The Zak Penn script (which Norton rewrote, though without final credit) doesn't aim to be anything other than a basic, straight-ahead action movie, but the set-pieces are well-executed and the final brawl between the Hulk and the Abomination -- with splendid Rhythm & Hues effects -- is something that kids and comic book fans ought to find perfectly satisfying.<br /><br />The performances are all fine, and although one wishes there was more of a human element to this "Hulk" (something that Norton lamented was lost in Marvel's final cut, and could possibly be rectified by an extended DVD this fall), it's still an entertaining summer fantasy that finally does the Incredible one justice on the big screen.</p></body></html>

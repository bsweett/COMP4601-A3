In the light of current special effects, it's showing its age, but the story still retains wonder and interest.  Richard Dreyfuss is very effective as the man who sights a group of U.F.O.'s and then becomes obsessed with them.  Others that have made sightings share the obsession, including a woman whose child is abducted by the aliens.  A seed is implanted in their minds that draws them to Wyoming.  Their stories are intercut with the story of two scientists (played by Truffault and Baliban) who are investigating the strange re-appearance of ships and planes that have been missing for years, and which turn up in strange locales.  They, too, receive a message (along the more conventional method of radio contact) to head to Wyoming.<p>Dreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time, and he easily carries the film.  As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession, he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest.  Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor, even when speaking through an interpreter.  Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance.  Likewise, the pacing and suspense through the first 2/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg, not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.<p>Unfortunately, the film grinds down to a deadly pace in the last 1/3 of the film.  It is essentially 40 minutes of a faceless mob (of scientists) and Dreyfuss staring at the sky and watching lights appear and disappear.  Yes, the effects are good, even by today's standards, but it is boring!  Similarly, Teri Garr as the protagonist's wife is nothing but a carricatured harpy, and their breakup is clumsily handled by the immature (at the time) director.  All in all, though, the film holds up well to time and repeated viewings.<p>This DVD edition is quite nice, with a 100-minute feature with commentary and insight from most of the principle filmakers and stars (except Truffault, who had passed away).  Spielberg does not do commentaries for his films, but he talks a lot in the feature which should sate the film buffs.  There are also some deleted scenes, including the &quot;new&quot; ending Columbia demanded for the &quot;Special Edition&quot; release in 1980.  The original 1977 ending is maintained for the film on this DVD (and rightfully so!).</p></body></html>

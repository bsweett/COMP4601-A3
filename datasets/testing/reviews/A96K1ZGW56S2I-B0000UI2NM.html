I had read so many negative reviews and heard so many people say that it was a rip-off of ROMEO AND JULIET, that I just wasn't expecting much. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when the final credits started to roll and I was left sitting in my seat thinking, "What? It's over already?".<p>As many have already stated, the film is about a vampire death-slayer (vampires who hunt wearwolves) who falls in love with a human who has been bitten by her most hated enemy, the werewolf overlord who was supposed to have been killed centuries before. The film starts off somewhat slow then rushes into a fighiting frenzy, then slows down, then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down. The entire movie is paced this way. Some find it irritating. However, I felt that it added to the mood of the movie, the pace of the film accompaning the transformations that the characters undergo both physically and psychologically.<p>The lighting and costumes seemed to fit the dark underworld that is the setting for most of the film. The only time the tones lightened up were in flashbacks to centuries before when the wearwolves and vampires weren't at war, suggesting a more pleasant era.<p>The characters in the movie aren't allowed to develop much, except through narrative. However, I didn't find that this took anything away from the movie. Much like all franchises (as UNDERWORLD is sure to become), this film sets up everything that is to come in the next.  This isn't a thinking person's movie nor is it a full blown action piece; in the style and tone the movie has more of a literary feel than anything else. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough conflict between the wearwolves and the vampires; so much time is spent on setting the tone, mood, and narrative that there wasn't much time left for action. Nevertheless, I still found that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.</p></body></html>

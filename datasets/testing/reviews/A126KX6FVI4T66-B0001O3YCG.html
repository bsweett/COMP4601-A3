<meta name="summary" content="The first Riddick space opera"></head><body><p>A small bunch of humans are space wrecked on a desert<br />planet that has a black secret. Deep in the caves<br />that riddle the planet are flesh eating bats who only come out when it is dark.<br />With three suns that only happens on very special occasions every 22 years.<br />Vin Diesel is actually a pretty decent actor, but his counter part<br />in the pretty blond co-pilot is less believable, but puts in a pretty good effort.<br />The bounty hunter who originally has Riddick in chains<br />is a better actor.  Survival in the dark turns into an epic struggle.<br />I liked the movie, but think this could have been done better<br />with a better female lead.</p></body></html>

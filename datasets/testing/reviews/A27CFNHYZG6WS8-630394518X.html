In his tales featuring the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, Poe dubbed the criminal and the detective, the 'creative' and the 'resolvant' - the criminal creates a crime like a work of art; the detective analyses and interprets it like a critic.  In 'Se7en', John Doe's serial killing has an aesthetical form - not only does he pattern it according to an overarching structure; not only does the method of each crime connect thematically to its sin; but each is an elaborate, meticulously-staged tableau which the detectives must read before they can understand it and proceed.  The thrller hinges on whether the detectives are good critics - William Somerset, who deals in dedicated scholarship, absorbing the primary texts, is; the younger Mills, who skimps with 'Cliff's Notes', isn't.<p>A second model in 'Se7en' is Dante's 'Divine Comedy', which screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker reverses.  Somerset is Virgil, the teacher full of cultural and ethical knowledge who should bring his student, Mills as Dante, to progressive understanding and enlightenment.  Rather than moving heavenwards, however, 'Se7en' is a slow ride to Hell, beginning with the Purgatorial Sin nearest to Heaven, Gluttony, and working down through the rest.  The ultimate goal facing the student is not achieving redemption but avoiding damnation.  Although New York might seem like a living hell - a medieval inferno plagued by random violence, apathy, noise, decay, rain, lonely rotting lives - it is really a Purgatorial testing-ground; but Somerset is a bad teacher, Mills an inattentive student.  <p>Then there is Borges, who, in stories such as 'Death and the Compass', used the detective format and the 'clues' to be read in Great Literature, to destroy the ethical assumptions of forms and identity.<p>'Se7en' is the kind of film that only seems a masterpiece on first viewing, when shock, suspense and novelty replace our critical faculties.  As such, its effect is immediate and gut-wrenching, as the film flatters our intellect without making any demands on it.  But as would become apparent in his later films, director Fincher always pulls back from being truly radical, and what seems to be a hopeless, dank, inexorable, anti-Hollywood apocalyptic vision is actually as reassuring as the most conservative detective novel: unlike Borges, it retains a faith in patterns, taking them to their logical conclusions, giving some sort of meaning, no matter how bleak to chaos.  Despite Somerset's protests, Doe is too reassuringly, articulately psychotic to suggest a projection of inner evil, remorse or Biblical vengeance (indeed, the film might be a moral story about man's hubris in replacing God).  The script contrivances (as in imaginative short-cuts, rather than failures in plausibility) become increasingly apparent.<p>The best directors - from Hitchcock to Ray to Soderbergh - are also Critics, interrogating the scripts they film, but Fincher seems content to reproduce Walker's pretentious gloom and thematic timidity - even the grungiest scenes are filmed with exquisite symmetry and loving detail.  The script itself queasily reproduces Doe's moral censoriousness, punishing in kind a woman who simply contemplated abortion.  The film is full of beautiful compositions (the brutally ironic torchlights in the opening investigation; the neon blue as they check out the 'Help Me' fingerprints); exciting set-pieces (the first chase of Doe; the wracking final 20 minutes); and gruesome moments (the jerk of a flayed victim).  The acting is terrific, especially Brad Pitt in his first great performance, using his good-looking cockiness to devastating effect, in many ways more complex and sympathetic than Morgan Freeman's earnest elder cop, with his intriguingly failed past and sterile present.  As a whole, however, I don't think 'Se7en' holds up.</p></body></html>

Think Frankenstein or King Kong."></head><body><p>Boy did THIS film get the short end of the stick by critics.<br />This is a great film. It's NOT really a comic book film, although the delightful editing techniques certainly refer to the source material's heritage.<br />This is a horror movie more than anything else. It's like Frankenstein meets Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde, albeit with a dollop of serious familial psychodrama mixed in for some texture.<br />It's always visually and aurally interesting, and the special effects are astonishing.  (Reference made only for comic geeks)<br />The Hulk character looks terrific, I thought. While it's not the character that Gollum was, remember, he has no lines. He roars and tosses tanks like a Olympian hammer throw athlete. There are plenty of glorious action scenes for those of you who care, yet there most definitely is a dense and detailed plot to back it up. After all, this IS Ang Lee we're talking about.<br />I loved the sly references to classic horror films, like King Kong and Frankenstein.<br />The cast is uniformly impressive; again, this IS Ang Lee. Bana, Connelly, Elliott, Nolte...yeah sure sometime they go a little &quot;over the top&quot;, but it all services the story.<br />The visual &quot;look&quot; to the film is highly original as well. Maybe not &quot;original&quot; in that dictionary sense...it borrows a lot from comic book story-telling techniques...but I don't think you will have seen a film that LOOKS like this one does. Inventive color schemes, camera angles, music cue choices and the marvelous editing design all combine most effectively.<br />I found myself more impressed with the film after I viewed the supplementary material. I found I wanted to tell people about this film...to give it a chance. Non-&quot;comic&quot; people may actually get more out of the film than we comic fans, but only the latter group will smile when he whips that tank over his head.<br />That looked perfect, didn't it?</p></body></html>

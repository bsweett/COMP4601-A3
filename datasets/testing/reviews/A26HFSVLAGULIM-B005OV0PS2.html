After the first five minutes, everything began to make perfect sense. The "Dude" turned out to be a very unlikely hero in what was a very unexpected string of vignettes that altogether made a delightful film experience.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges as The Dude is always 'ON' in a very disarming way. His integrity of character through all the bizarre twists and turns of this story is what holds the film together and makes this unlikely yarn somehow quite believable.<br /><br />OF COURSE "THE DUDE'S" GOT FRIENDS:<br /><br />John Goodman as "Walter Sobchak" is quite a handful and is responsible for the plot thickening the third time, or is that the fourth? Goodman portrays the misunderstood Vietnam Vet who needs The Dude to be his co-dependent, but has found in The Dude someone even more dysfunctional than himself. Walter has a problem insofar as understanding that violence is not always cool. He seems to like guns with a leaning toward automatic weapons. RESULT = OOPS!<br /><br />In the mess that ensues, we have pretend kidnappings or are they real? We have a trophy wife for an old disabled man in a wheelchair. We have bowling -- very serious bowling. We have angry people roughly demanding money from The Dude and urinating on his carpet, setting the whole fable in motion.<br /><br />SOMEHOW ALL THESE GRAND VIGNETTES MAKE A REALLY COOL MOVIE:<br /><br />Add to this Nihilists, a police chief, actors, weird art, strange people, The "Stranger" and bizarre motivations and you get one heck of a movie. We even have detectives following The Dude and somehow in awe of just how incredible he is! Through all this and a series of little skits that altogether make a movie, The Dude tries to hold it all together, to get a replacement rug, and to do the right thing. Somehow The Dude gets it right in the end.<br /><br />To sum up, this film works on many levels and is a very refreshing though unorthodox way to spin a good yarn. Check it out and see if you agree!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />Excellent widescreen transfer.</p></body></html>

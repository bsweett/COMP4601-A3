<meta name="summary" content="Definitely a DVD to Own - But Don't Read Any Plot Spoilers!"></head><body><p>The Usual Suspects is a film noir movie set in modern times. I adore film noir movies, and one of the first things you learn about this genre is NOT TO READ PLOT DETAILS! I will not give away ANY plot details in this review. If you get even the inkling of what happens in the plot, it tends to make you "wait" through the entire movie for that particular twist or turn to happen. It is so much better to watch the movie all the way through the first time, plot unknown, to watch how it unfolds. That's what makes the film noir movies so great for watching and rewatching. The first time you see it, you are caught up in how the mystery elements are linked together and unraveled. In subsequent watchings, you know what the end game is, and you now enjoy all the clues and hints that are laid out for you along the way. Where most movies can get boring after a viewing or two, I've seen many of my film noir movies quite a large number of times.<br /><br />The beauty of The Usual Suspects is the stellar cast involved - Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, and many others. Every one of these actors does a fantastic job. There are so many quotes, so many specific lines of dialogue, so many tiny eye movements and looks that just bring incredible depth to this story. Again, I don't want to give away the details of the plot for you to "watch for". Once you've seen the movie, there will undoubtedly be moments that stand out for you. But don't stop there. Go back and watch it again. Suddenly you'll realize the meaning in the way someone looks at someone else - the way someone reacts to a specific line of dialogue. It's simply brilliant.<br /><br />There are a number of heavily accented characters here which means the first time through you might not really realize what someone is saying. They do that on purpose. Those people *have* accented voices. It means you don't really understand what's going on in some scenes. Again, when you re-watch, you start to sink deeper into the environment. You realize what certain words mean. You realize the context of the situation. It is a multi-layered adventure and each time you take a look, something else unfolds for you.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for owning. This isn't a one-time-watch film. It's something you see multiple times, share with family and friends, and then discuss afterwards. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

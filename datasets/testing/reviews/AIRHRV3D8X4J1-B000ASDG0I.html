I have to say this movie was far better than i expected it to be. What makes this movie so awesome is the attatchment you get to the characters. Brad Pitt is awesome in this movie and hilareous as well. Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job as well. The chemistry between these two is intense and at times very believable. The movie does start out slow and is over the top at times, but it is really a great movie. I have always liked Brad Pitts (Fight Club, Troy) movies but with this movie you see more of a three dimentional character and not just some one dimentional hot looking guy on screen. If you like entertaining and awesome movies then check out Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The DVD will be released Tuesday, November 29th, 2005 and will be loaded with extras!</p></body></html>

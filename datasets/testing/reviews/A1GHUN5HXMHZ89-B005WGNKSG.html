<meta name="summary" content="The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"></head><body><p>One of the better murder mystery films I have seen in awhile. If you don't mind subtitles or dubbing it is well worth a look. A gothic female researcher is running background checks by hacking into a magazine reporter's computer. It seems he has been framed for reporting on a crooked tycoon. Meanwhile he is investigating the forty year old dispearance case of a young girl by the request of a wealthy businessman. The man belongs to an unusual foundation that has several suspicious founders. The reporter has a limited window to investigate while waiting to do his six month sentence for slander. When he uncovers some interesting clues to the case, the researcher decides to help him figure out the meaning of some odd initials and numbers the missing girl left. The tension starts to build as they join forces and find several twists and turns to what happened, and their lives are threatened when they get to close to the truth. Excellent mystery that although not fast paced as some, the story, directing, acting, and camera work make it well worth the patience. This is very much an adult movie with some graphic scenes that may be hard to view by some. They are in fact very well done and in fact clarify the abuse of women rather than detract from the movie. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A walk down memory lane"></head><body><p>It has been a long time since I've seen the original Star Wars theatrical releases. The way they were ORIGINALLY. I loved it. For me, it's like watching a good Charlie Chaplin movie. You don't focus on the lack of special effects, sound or what they don't have. You let your imagination run wild and simply go along for the ride.<br /><br />As Luke Skywalker begins his journey to self-discovery, I find myself walking it with him, unobstructed by 21st century special effects and additions that look grossly out of place in the updated version. The updated version has its place, but I much prefer the classic 1977 release.<br /><br />There's something to be said for the way things were... "a long long time ago, in a movie theater not so far away..."</p></body></html>

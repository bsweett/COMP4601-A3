<meta name="summary" content="Solid SF-action movie"></head><body><p>With the second X-Men movie rolling out this summer, I decided that it would be a good time to get off my backside and watch the first. What I found was a very enjoyable action movie, with more brains than one usually finds in that genre, with a good cast and excellent direction. If the sequel is this good, then it will definitely be worth watching.<p>In recent years, an increasing number of people have been discovered to be mutants, whose DNA has taken a leap forward and given them superhuman powers. Now their freedom is threatened. Rogue, a girl whose touch can kill (Anna Paquin) and Logan/Wolverine, (Hugh Jackman) a man with steel claws and amazing regenerative abilities are attacked in Canada, only to be rescued by mutants and taken to a top-secret "school for the gifted" in New York. It's run by the mind-reading/controlling mutant Carles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), to teach and protect his fellow mutants, known as X-Men.<p>But there are others without such benevolent plans. Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor who can generate powerful magnetic fields, anticipates a coming war between mutants and ordinary humans. With the help of the reptilian shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), savage Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), and nasty Toad (Ray Park), he abducts and artificially mutates a U.S. senator, then threatens the entire population of New York with a bizarre weapon. And only the X-Men can hope to stop him. <p>Yes, it sounds cheesy, but it's done well. In fact, most of the movie goes under the listing of sounds-stupid-but-is-done-well. The superpower-enhanced action sequences are well done, and the mutants are given human edges and attachments that keep them from just being pretty faces with superpowers. They may not be homo sapiens any longer, but in personality they are quite human. The special effects are surprisingly muted, and usually kept in tune with the storyline. Though this is an action movie, it bothers to have a complicated plotline including politics, history, and a bit of commentary on intolerance and mindless prejudice as well. <p>Patrick Stewart does a good job as a benevolent father-figure to all the mutants (they're even referred to as his "children" in one scene). Ian McKellen is flawless as Magneto; this is not some random wanna-conquer-the-world villain, but someone who is embittered and determined to the point of potential genocide. (An interesting parallel is that he is a survivor of the Holocaust, yet he seeks to establish a "master race" of mutants) Hugh Jackman does a good job with Wolverine's tough-guy image that covers his confusion and loneliness, since he doesn't know who he is or who put metal all over his bones. Anna Paquin annoyed me as Rogue, because she seems to cry a lot. Famke Janssen (as telekinetic Jean Grey), Halle Berry (as weather-controlling Storm), and James Marsden (as laser-eyed Cyclops) are all good supporting roles, although Berry's role is somewhat thinner than her costars'.<p>This movie is also a bit darker than films like Spiderman, more adult and more disturbing (especially with the themes about prejudice and discrimination). This movie isn't quite flawless, unfortunately. Some of the costumes are a bit overdone, especially Storm's -- is there any logical reason for her to wear that silver catsuit and cape? Most of the characters are fine, like Cyclops and Wolverine, but occasionally the costumes get a little silly. Additionally, many of the scientific aspects of the movie are never explained at all, such as Kelly's transformation into the human jellyfish. How exactly does Magneto do this? I'm a little fuzzy on how that radiation is generated and how it affects ordinary humans.<p>Despite these flaws, "X-Men" is a good solid action/SF movie, especially since it so easily could have been a total disaster. Pop popcorn and sit back.</p></body></html>

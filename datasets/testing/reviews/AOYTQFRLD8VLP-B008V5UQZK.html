Life is made a little easier for her by her cheerful and understanding mother, played by Lainie Kazan.<br /> I somehow feel that Toula, played with both pathos and skillful comic timing by Nia Vardalous, who adapted her hit play for the big screen, could only be a middle child. Sandwitched between her "older, perfect sister", Athena (played by a nagging and very Type A Stavroula Logothettis) and her prankish but supportive younger brother Nick(Louis Mandylor), she starts out as an insecure girl whose notoriously ethnocentric parents send her to school with a lunchbox with the image of the Greek flag  on it instead of something more trendy, make her attend Greek school when her classmates attend Brownies, and never give her a satisfactory explanation about why she is constantly on a divergent path from others. As a young adult working in her family's restaurant, she deals with constant familial discussions about her marital status as if she isn't there to listen to them, she cannot ask for her father's support of her decision to return to school with any confidence(although she gets her way gradually), and later, when she embraces John Corbett's staid, friendly, and well-mannered non-Greek Ian Miller as her suitor, her parents challenge her decision by forcing the hapless Toula to play hostess to an obnoxious parade of men of her own nationality, whom they quite unbelievably prefer as mates for their daughter.It seems that older or younger children in a family are less likely to be under that much pressure to tow the line.<br /> Physically, it has to be noted that Nia Vardalous has dignified classic Greek features, reminiscent of  the profile portraiture on Grecian urns.<br /> In due time, we come to know Toula's large, boisterous extended family, including her Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) who can be gauche and rather pushy,but funny, Yiayia (Bess Meisler)who is a walking example of war-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,and who clings as tenaciously to life as she does to her Greek Peasant garb, and the scene-stealing Gia Carides' big-haired, brassy, buxom,flamboyant, life-loving and gregarious drama queen, Nikki, to name a few.<br />  The groom's parents (Bruce Grey and Fiona Reid)are rather overwhelmed by the bride's family and their customs,but gradually come to embrace them, and Toula grows into someone who accepts her family and develops a more mature understanding of herself and appreciation for her heritage.<br /> While this film should be viewed with a grain of salt and not be taken as a definitive portrayal of Greek family life, it has an enjoyable livliness to it, enhanced by kicky bouzouki music, and because family eccentricties are often great onscreen fodder, it has been, quite understandably, a great success. Adiya, everybody!</p></body></html>

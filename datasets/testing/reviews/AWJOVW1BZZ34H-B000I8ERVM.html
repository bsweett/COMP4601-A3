<meta name="summary" content="Possessed or psycho?"></head><body><p>A priest is charged with wrongful death when a young woman dies while he is performing an exorcism. A hot-shot attorney defends the priest even though she doesn't believe in the Devil or God.<br /><br />Based on a true story, this is a thoughtful movie that will keep your interest. If you are looking for any of the head spinning, puking like the exorcist you wouldn't find it in this movie. There are some scary scenes, but the movie itself isn't scary because it is told through flashbacks in the courtroom. also the question of possessed or psycho is not really answered at the end of the movie. Maybe they are planning a sequel.</p></body></html>

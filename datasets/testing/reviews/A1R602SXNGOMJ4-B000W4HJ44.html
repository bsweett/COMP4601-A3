Much Better"></head><body><p>The reason I rented this video was because I watched the original with Ricki Lake a few years ago and I thought it was hilarious.  This new version was a big disappointment for me.  This version comes off more like a bad Disney after school special.  All of the musical numbers sounded the same, and were just over-the-top with their Broadway-like style. Aside from "Seaweed" the characters weren't as likable as they were in the original Waters film. In fact, even the main character Tracy Turnblad got on your nerves as she broke into song about every three minutes. And all the songs sounded the same. No variety.<br />I did, however, think that the cameo with Ricki Lake was well done.  As for seeing John Travolta dressed up as a woman, well that was worth it.  This film only made me want to see the original version all over again. Watch that one instead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretentious, Contrived, And Excremental"></head><body><p>This pretentious nonsense preaches socially conscious lessons straight from the hippy manifesto as an excuse to stitch together hallucinogenic music videos featuring a variety of performers singing Beatles songs. The songs vary in quality dramatically, with the very worst being "Let It Be", "Come Together", and "I Want You" (as an Army recruiting musical), although given the breadth of material it's hard to single out a true low point.<br /><br />There is lots of very plastic dialogue about revolution, etc. (e.g. "We need to radicalize!"), which would be easier to take seriously if the characters weren't named Jude, Prudence, Lucy, Jojo, and other obvious starting points for musical numbers. While the film is ostensibly a love story, it it's really more an excuse to revisit the radicalism of the 1960's, with spoiled self-important whiny brats providing self-indulgent and brainless commentary on world events, with Vietnam at the obvious forefront.<br /><br />Several things should be obvious takeaways from this cinematic Hindenburg: Bono shouldn't act, Joe Cocker should never be backed by a choir, and Julie Taymor should never, ever be allowed to make another movie. Ever.<br /><br />This would be the last movie I would recommend to my worst enemy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CATCH ME IN THE CAN"></head><body><p>DiCaprio and Hanks combine with Spielberg to produce an amusing,true story of a young rebel (Leo) outfoxing Hanks' special FBI unit on counterfeiting for years. Leo is at his acting best, following in the footsteps of his "loose" mother and his rip-off specialist father.He uses his keen intellect to assume top quality jobs in the airlines, as a doctor, and finally a lawyer,cashing millions of dollars of bogus checks along his route. The picture frolics along for about an hour until, suddenly, it seemingly goes flat, even boring. And it's Hanks, working with the alacrity of Barnaby Jones and the acumen of Inspector Clousseau that's to blame. No recording devices, 3 agents at the party, no effective police backups, a literal crawl up the stairs at the party, a complete lack of aggressiveness, the ridiculous escape from Miami, all seem to point to a deliberate lengthening of the film. Add a really ludicrous semi-climax where Leo is set free, again garbed in a pilot's uniform, and the film loses all credibility. Summing up, the plot was there for a great movie;instead this reviewer saw a fair/good one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="disturbing"></head><body><p>i got done watching this movie only twenty minutes ago.i was so moved by it,i rushed right to my dinosaur computer and put forth this review.<br />  i thought this movie was going to be a stupid x-men rip off.it was however not that at all.whoever wrote and directed this movie will sink to any low.there is no line that they will not cross.there is rape,a pregnant woman being executed,a 6 year old girl being mutilated and fed to dogs and thats just the worst stuff.this movie is very graphic and very detailed.i think i have a very good stomach for movie violence but this is just sick!not to mention the rape victim continualy says she didnt mind.its beyond what should be allowed.i know that goes against the first ammendment but this hollywood crap asks once again "were they right?"<br /><br />ok,that off my chest,the movie was a secret society type movie.i hate it when the movie is very secretive and stuff until the end.i mean why advertise it as a comic book movie at all?why not "mystery"?then we would know we will sit through 90 plus minutes of questions and 5 minutes of confusing answers.<br />also,the super heroes werent even in thier prime ,they were all old.it was like a million dollar version of mermaid man and barnacle boy from sponge bob.it had that 1920s jazzy feel to it.<br />now,the super heroes are viewed as the bad guys in this one.they were brutal and the enforcers and it pissed people off.<br />the 2 biggest losers in the whole movie are those who survive too.that was no good.of course i cant say who here.<br />this one guy called "comedian" was played by wayne gayle from "natural born killers".he was a very nuerotic wanna be cop gone tv parasite in that movie.i dont care if he is iron man or comedian or who .he is always going to be that dorky talk show guy.<br />but,there were some good points.the "smartest man in the world",was a great character.and dr manhatten was one of the coolest characters of all time even though he seems like a silver surfer rip off only he teleports.he is way cooler than silver surfer though.his ho-bag girl friend sais something like "everthing is quantum mechanics and alternate universes with this guy".its cool to see that they took a genius and made him cool.<br />the special effects were both good and bad.the nuclear holocaust was less than stellar.most of the stuff with dr manhatten was awesome!but,the violence was either cool stuff we wanted to see as pre teens like knees getting snapped and the bone coming out OR was totaly gross,way too much information and just gross!<br />so thats why i gave it a 3 star rating.the awesome stuff is 5 star quality.the bad stuff was 1 star quality.[i couldnt give it less].so theres your average!</p></body></html>

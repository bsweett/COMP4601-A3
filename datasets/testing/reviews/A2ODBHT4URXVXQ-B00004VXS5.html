<meta name="summary" content="Why can't they all be this good?"></head><body><p>Okay, who holds the record for having seen this movie the most times?? I've seen it maybe 5 times, and I know I'm not even in the running. My 18yo kid says he's seen it about 10 times (and he says he wants Blondie's cigar). My father, who is 89, has seen it maybe 20 times (by his admittedly vague recollection).<br />Any movie that can span the affections of 3 generations deserves 5-star rating.<br />Why can't all Westerns be like this, made up of bad guys, badder buys, and the really bad, bad guys? Angel Eyes is the personification of suave evil, like a beautiful deadly snake; Blondie represents honor among thieves. But oh, every time Tuco comes on the scene, he steals the show. Who will ever forget his wavering alliances, his race through the cemetery, his face at the stagecoach when he realizes Blondie holds the missing piece of information: the name on the grave where the gold is buried, his whimpering at the end as he balanced on a crumbling cemetery cross with a noose around his neck? And the music! Doo-y-ooo-y-oooooo....Wah WAH Wah... Spectacular. 10 stars, please.<br />Now I'm going to go watch it again, and try to catch up with my dad.</p></body></html>

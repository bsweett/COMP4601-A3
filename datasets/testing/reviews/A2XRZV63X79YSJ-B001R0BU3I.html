But without giving away the twists...<br /><br />Traitor is about a terrorist plot to wreak havoc in the heartland of America.  At the heart of the terrorist group is an Sammy (Don Cheadle).  He saw his father get blown up in the Sudan. He was raised by his American mother until he was expelled from school and joined the Army.  But he became disallusioned in the Gulf War and has fallen in with a group that has been terriorising Europe and is now ready to strike at America. Hot on his tracks are two FBI agents (Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough)<br /><br />the movie is fast paced but this subject matter has been well trod by better movies and especially TV specials.  This is an good movie with the usual great performance by Don Cheadle. The remaining cast is equally great.<br /><br />This is a movie to see for the performances not for the script.  Definitely a good rental or download.</p></body></html>

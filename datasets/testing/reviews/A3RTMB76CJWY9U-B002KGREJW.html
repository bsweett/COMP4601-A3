<meta name="summary" content="No One Gets Left Behind"></head><body><p>We're all a little screwed up.<br /><br />So are the characters in Little Miss Sunshine. All right--maybe them more than most. The father (Greg Kinnear) is a failed motivational speaker, the wife's brother is a failed suicide, the grandfather has been kicked out of his nursing home for drug abuse... well... you get the idea. The entire family races across the US in a VW bus that has as many problems as its owners in order to get the young daughter, maybe the only sane member of the clan (maybe), to a Los Angeles beauty pageant.<br /><br />So what do you do when you're screwed up, when your family is screwed up, when the whole world is screwed up? The answers found in this film are soft and beautiful. This is a beautiful movie, absurd and real somehow at the same time. All of the technical stuff is great (writing, acting, etc.) but it is the intangible--the great compassion of the film--that carries it to greatness. It assures us that, no matter how screwed up we might be, no one gets left behind in our family.<br /><br />Touching and triumphant.</p></body></html>

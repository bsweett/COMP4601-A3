<meta name="summary" content="Excellent!"></head><body><p>Very compelling and well acted film showing all the corruption and suffering that go into producing the world's diamond supply.  Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as a corrupt adventurer who seeks out diamonds for some shady London businessmen.  He comes across a man in prison who claims to have found a huge diamond.  DiCaprio strikes a deal with him to help him locate his family if he will lead DiCaprio to the diamond.<br /><br />Loaded with action and some "disturbing" violence.  The only negative for me was DiCaprio's fake sounding South African accent which seemed to grate on ones nerves if you listened long enough.</p></body></html>

There are some movies that don't really have much of an effect when I'm watching them, but that creep me out later, upon reflection. There are very, very few films that both blow me away and creep me out later for thoroughly different reasons. In fact, I can only think of one-- the original Candyman (which got me when I watched it for the final scene, and kept me awake nights for weeks afterwards because of the Oscar-worthy sound effects editing in the parking garage scene)-- that did it to me before I saw The Exorcism of Emily Rose.<br /><br />This is a "wow" movie-- one that, if I were writing reviews for the local paper, would get simply that word as a review. It is a fantastic movie from beginning to end, with its positives far outweighing its negatives. If you ignore the rest of the review, here's all you need to know: see this movie.<br /><br />I heard a pundit, back when it originally came out, refer to this movie as "Law and Order with demons." To an extent, that's true; the movie centers not around Emily Rose (White Chicks' Jennifer Carpenter) herself, who is already dead as the film opens, but around Erin Bruner (Laura Linney of The Mothman Prophecies), an attorney for the law firm representing the diocese where the priest in the case, Father Moore (The Full Monty's Tom Wilkinson), attempted to exorcise Emily. Emily's story itself is told in flashbacks as Erin gets more of the story from Moore and others who knew her. (Okay, so maybe it's actually CSI with demons.)<br /><br />As with most horror films of this nature-- though in retrospect, it's hard to call The Exorcism of Emily Rose a horror film-- the real disturbance for the viewer is going to come in the subtle things. The changes in Emily's appearance as the story goes on are obvious, but there are subtleties that really kick the viewer in the teeth. You might not even notice them on a conscious level, but they're the things that make all the difference in making this look real. (The devil is in the details, indeed.) But behind the "we're out to give you nightmares" aspect lies excellent filmmaking; the camerawork, script, pacing, etc. are all wonderful. The acting is good, though no one turns in a truly great performance. That said, Linney is far, far, better here than she was in The Mothman Prophecies. Wilkinson, as always, is on his game (though the film's one major failing is that his attempt at a rural American accent is, at times, pathetic to the point of laughability). Colm Feore, as Erin's boss, has a small but wonderful part that makes the most of Feore's innate creepiness. The real pleasure here, though, is Carpenter, who finally gets a solid role with meat in it, and turns out to have quite the appetite.<br /><br />The final straw, of course, is that (unlike The Amityville Horror, whatever Andrew Douglas wants you to believe) The Exorcism of Emily Rose is based on a true story. (How closely based, I have no idea, as I have not yet tracked down The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel, the book on which this film is based; it's been out of print for a while, and to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been reissued. Odd, that.)<br /><br />Flirting with inclusion in my all-time-100-best list. Really, Tom Wilkinson's accent is its only stumbling block. **** ?</p></body></html>

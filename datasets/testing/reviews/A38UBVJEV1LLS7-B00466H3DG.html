Simple, moving, intelligent, well written, and perfectly acted, what more could one ask for?!<br /><br />I have read some reviews that said that the plot was complicated, but I must fiercely disagree; the plot is as easy to follow as it is easy to watch. Woman erases man, man wants to erase woman, man changes his mind. The real fun is in watching them escape from memory to memory in a funny, tear-jerking move to save his love from extinction.<br /><br />This movie is perfectly acted. Carrey gives, easily, his finest serious performance, and probably his best overall. One can literally see the pain in his face, which is looking its age I might add; never-the-less, for the first time I was moved by one of his performances. Other great jobs in the film were done by: Dunst (perfect for the cute, free secretary), Ruffalo (looking good in the undies), Wilkinson (in a role that nearly mimics that of _In the Bedroom_), and Wood (great as the unlikable thief). However, these, to me, pale in comparison to the superb (and hopefully Oscar winning) performance of Kate Winslet as the off the wall girlfriend with a thousand haircolors. She really blew me away (as she always does).<br /><br />See this move, bottom line. It is not just a crazy "art movie" like so many I have talked about. Just see it and you will see the beauty that is locked inside the "Mind."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Royale with Chesse"></head><body><p>O.K this movie was a good movie don't get me wrong, basically its about Hitmen and various other people that meet there fates over a few days.  <p>Parts of it are very funny and you find yourself growing attracted to the characters dispute the fact that they are mostly bad guys <p>I really liked the part in the diner with the two robbers(the pros meet the wannabes kinda thing)<p>However I finished watching this movie with the same feeling I got watching "Natural Born Killers".  For some of these scenes what the heck was the point?  <p>The most glaring case in point for me was the whole Zed/Butch/Mahshalus sex scene.  Now why was this scene even in the movie?  I know people don't take this film literally but it still ticks me off(check out where I'm from).  What if a guy never travled below the Mason-Dixon in his entire life and only saw "Pulp Fiction"</p></body></html>

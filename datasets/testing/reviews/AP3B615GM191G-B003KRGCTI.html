<meta name="summary" content="Finally, A Religiously-Oriented Film That Doesn't Pander/Preach"></head><body><p>When it comes to films with religious trappings, one of two things usually happens: It either bashes all other religions in favor of the one being espoused, or gets a little too preachy and fawns all over itself.  Book of Eli does neither of those things; instead letting the viewer decide the importance/meaning of the religious undertones.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, Book of Eli focuses on a lone traveler (Denzel Washington) trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic America.  When one day he wanders into a rebuilding community, he is harassed by a man (Gary Oldman) who desires a powerful book that the traveler has in his possession.<br /><br />The plot of this film is okay, though at times predictable and/or slow.  However, there are three areas in which the film really excels:<br /><br />-Acting: Denzel and Oldman both give strong, professional performances, while Mila Kunis proves more than just a pretty face as well.<br /><br />-Imagery: The depiction of a completely desolate, war-torn nation is very powerful and interesting.  You never know what sort of crazy character you might meet next.<br /><br />-Religious Themes: The concept of religion is central to the entire film, but is shown as a potential force for good or evil.<br /><br />Thus, although Book of Eli isn't a masterpiece, it is easily interesting enough to entertain fans of Washington, thriller/action, and heavy thematic material.</p></body></html>

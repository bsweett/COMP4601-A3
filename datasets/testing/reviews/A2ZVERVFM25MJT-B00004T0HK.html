Recommended it by a friend I eventually sat down to watch it.  When I did I was completely mesmerised.  It takes an incredibly difficult premise and manages to make it credible, evocative and tragic.  It's basically about a member of a white supremacy group, Edward Norton, who goes to prison for three years after killing three car theifs in a race attack.  Told through the eyes of his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong, as he begins to follow in the footsteps of his brother.  The movie takes a look at Norton's time in prison, his return and his effect on those around him.<p>'American History X' certainly doesn't shy away from some of its key moments and is highly graphic, so be warned.  Never before have I watched such horrible sights of brutality and been moved to such an extent, some scenes are just so horrible that you will find yourself crying out.  This makes it even more hard-hitting, and its message is a lot more complicated than 'racism is bad'.  It talks about the effect of society on a disillusioned youth population, racial friction and the family unit.<p>Thanks to Edward Norton's brave, compelling performance, the audience is really dragged into his emotional turmoil.  His performance is unflinching, refusing to cop out and go for the sympathetic vote.  He's backed up by strong performances from Edward Furlong (the kid from 'Terminator 2') and Fairuza Balk (a much underrated actress whose formidable acting ability is yet again proved here) as his girlfriend.<p>This is a movie that has several levels to it.  It's touching, horrific and serves up some troubling issues about the society that we live in.  'American History X' is a movie that everyone should see, and is one of only two movies (the other being 'Heavenly Creatures') that affected me to great depth.</p></body></html>

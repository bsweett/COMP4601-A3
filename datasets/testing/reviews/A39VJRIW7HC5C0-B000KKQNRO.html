<meta name="summary" content="Runs out of momentum"></head><body><p>The film started well enough, I suppose, though for all the money the book made I kinda expected something a little better-set-up than a priest who gets shot (from near point-blank range) in the stomach so that he has just enough time to leave some incredibly cryptic clues for his pal Robert Langdon.  Nonetheless it captured my interest for a while despite the complete lack of plausibility, and I liked some of the details (e.g. the bullet stopping the door from shutting).<br /><br />But fairly soon after Ian McKellan shows up things start bogging down.  McKellan's character is lively, but the backstory is heavy even without appearances by Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany's respective characters.  Numerous twists and turns keep occurring and the pace of the film began to crawl.  By the time of the denouement (which I found amusing, and not in a good way) I was checking my watch every 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />So the verdict?  A disappointing 2 stars out of 4.  The movie's theology is sometimes interesting but far too trivial to carry the film (let alone provide controversy, in my mind, but that ship has sailed) so the movie has to fall back upon its "thriller" aspects, and that aspect isn't strong enough to carry the film either.  Don't bother deciphering this code :)</p></body></html>

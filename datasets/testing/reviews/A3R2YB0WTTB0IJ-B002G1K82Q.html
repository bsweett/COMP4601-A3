<meta name="summary" content="JULIE TAYMOR, OPUS 3"></head><body><p>***** 2007. Written and directed by Julie Taymor. An Academy award and a Golden Globe nomination. The 60's seen through the songs of the Beatles. A unique vision developed by one of the most interesting directors of our time. I was already enthused a few years ago by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a> and the way Julie Taymor managed to give life to some of Frida Kahlo's paintings, now I can't but praise this film. The screenplay is uttermost smart, the actors perfect and Julie Taymor a director one has to count with. Masterpiece.</p></body></html>

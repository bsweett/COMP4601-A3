<meta name="summary" content="Not as fun as 28 Weeks Later, not as thought provoking as The Invasion, I Am Legend is mostly forgetible"></head><body><p>I know this will come as a disappointment to the millions of night dwellers willing to risk crowded roads and over priced tickets in order to see this movie, but sadly I Am Legend does not live up to its hype. The third movie release of Richard Matheson's horror classic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">I Am Legend</a>, this film stars Will Smith as a former military officer living in New York City in the year 2012, three years after a deadly virus created to cure cancer mutated and decimated the worlds population, killing 90% of all human beings and transforming almost everyone else into blood thirsty zombie/vampire like creatures called "night dwellers" who come out only at night because UV rays from the sun burn their skin.<br /><br />Will Smith is the last man on earth, his only companion being his family dog named Samantha, or Sam for short, and manikins at the movie rental store that he likes to talk to. He goes though the "Cast Away" effect, like Tom Hank's character tries to remain sane by talking to a volleyball, Will Smith talks to manikins. the most stunning aspect of this film is the city itself; a deserted Time Square, overgrown with weeds and taken over by deer and escaped lions, is pretty creepy but unfortunately for this film 28 Days Later outdid it years ago with its deserted London, shot on location without using special effects. Anybody familiar with zombie movies have seen dozens of deserted cities as good or better before, whether it is from the 28 series or Romero's Living Dead series. I Am Legend, although impressive, is hardly groundbreaking in this area.<br /><br />while the city effects are good, the main focus of this movie is how Will Smith deals with being the last man left alive. a military man at heart, he goes though a rigid routine every day, exercising with his dog in the morning, working in his lab trying to find a cure, making his radio broadcast at noon and hoping someone will answerer, and then spending the rest of the day hunting and gathering supplies. At night, when the night dwellers roam the streets, he returns home where his home transforms into a fortress, and falls asleep in the bathtub. Then, next day, he does the same thing. his tests for a cure drive him to seek out human specimens every now and then, so like in Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8L9">Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)</a> he captures zombies, brings them into his basement, and tries to cure them, more often killing them then helping.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie never has a real sense of focus. does it want to be a character drama that keeps the zombies in the background and highlights the characters loneliness and despair like Night of the Living Dead, or does it want to be a classic shoot em up zombie movie like Resident Evil or 28 Weeks Later? It never makes up its mind, and in the end does both poorly. there isn't enough character depth to make this a great character drama, for that it needed to be at least twenty if not thirty minutes longer, and it doesn't have anywhere near enough action to make it a shoot out film; actually there is very little in the way of action. Social commentary is none existent as well, giving this film absolutely nothing to set it apart from other zombie/horror/virus movies from this year, or any other year. its lack of originality and depth makes almost guarantees this movie to go the way of other I Am Legend movie adoptions <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>. It will make its million dollars, and end up in discount bins five years from now. It's a shame really; this movie had the potential to be something truly great.<br /><br />Re-watch value; low.</p></body></html>

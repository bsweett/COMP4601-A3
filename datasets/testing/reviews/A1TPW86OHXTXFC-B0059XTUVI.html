It is one of those remarkable performances that you are unlikely to forget. The real Margaret Thatcher, however, was left somewhere else. I got the point that she was a strong woman, opinionated and had a rough road to hoe to her position as Prime Minister, but the rest was left elsewhere.<br /><br />Streep's performance and that of David Broadbent, who plays her husband, Dennis, were the highlights of the film. The story is told in flashbacks and as we are told in terms of a demented, Margaret Thatcher. Not the best way to portray a woman of such substance. It is intimated that her son, Mark, was not and has not been a big part of her life. It was also intimated that Margaret Thatcher was not a big part of her children's lives. Not much was explained, it is all a perception. Much of what Margaret Thatcher went through as part of the House of Commons was also our perception. It looked like she had a great deal to overcome with her male colleagues, and the fact that she was the first Prime Minister is remarkable. That road in her life, needed much more emphasis.<br /><br />Meryl Streep gave such a superb performance, this was the film. She deserved the Academy Award for this performance.<br />That, however, is the film, and I expected so much more.<br /><br />Recommended for performance. prisrob 05-10-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003E7PZCO">It's Complicated</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R1B6YA">Defending Your Life</a></p></body></html>

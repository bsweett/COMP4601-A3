<meta name="summary" content="This is a Thriller, not a Horror Movie!"></head><body><p>Just watched this movie last night and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was going to be more of a zombie horror flick, but really it was about the end of the world and finding out how to survive. It wasn't scary to me at all as some other reviewers claim, but it was very interesting and intense. It is slow in some parts, but never boring. I like how they make the infected people quick and decisive, rather than slow and lumbering. 28 Days wasn't as gory as expected either, but it had it's moments. If you want to see a good thriller that poses a realistic way the world could end, check out 28 Days Later.</p></body></html>

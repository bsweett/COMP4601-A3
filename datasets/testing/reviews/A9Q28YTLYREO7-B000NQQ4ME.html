Rudy YoungBlood does a Great Job in this Movie. the running and escaping each possible Deadly situations. I was pulling for dude at the end when he had to save His Lady and there Kids in the water. that dive into the water falls was something else. the Intensity of the film kept you on the edge of your seat. a must see and very intense film.</p></body></html>

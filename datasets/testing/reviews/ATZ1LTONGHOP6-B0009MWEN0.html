<meta name="summary" content="Like a WW2 epic...with bugs"></head><body><p>After graduating from high school, Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) follows his girlfriend, Carmen (Denise Richards), and best friend, Carl (Neil Patrick Harris), to enlist in the military, but when war is declared between humans and a race of highly-evolved giant bugs, Rico proves that he is a hero in his own right.<br /><br />"Starship Troopers" can be best described as an over-the-top, unbelievably trashy remake of every World War II epic ever made...but with bugs instead of Nazis as the villains. Based of the comments that I have heard from critics and my friends, in the decade since this film was released, this is the sort of film that you will either love or hate, although I, personally, cannot imagine how anyone could not like this film. If you love really trashy B-grade horror movies, then you will adore this film. It is essentially a B-grade movie made on an A-grade budget. This film contains gratuitous violence, sex and nudity; disturbingly large quantities of bug blood; and Denise Richards. How could that not appeal? The script is a lot smarter than you would imagine, essentially it is a satire of war propaganda films, complete with newsreels and more scenes of bravery than I've seen since John Wayne's death. It is also directed by Paul Verhoeven, the man who gave the world "Basic Instinct", who impressed me so much with this film that I am now half tempted to watch the infamous "Showgirls".</p></body></html>

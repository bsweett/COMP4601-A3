Well there was a certain amount of those.  But it was so much more!  A very clever script, brilliantly brought to life by a terrific cast.<br /><br />I love Robert Downey, Jr. although I fell out of love temporarily at Sherlock Holmes.  I was very happy to see him in top of his form.  He's perfect as the hapless petty criminal who stumbles, literally into a job as an actor, and a huge mess.  Downey and Kilmer spar beautifully as the crook and the gay PI who fall in together to make sense of their revolting predicament.  Michelle Monaghan is just right as Downey's love interest.  She's good hearted and cute and really dumb at times (manages to cut off Downey's finger) and brilliant and heroic at other times.  I'd love to see a sequal with the two of them.<br /><br />The dialog is as clever and snappy as anything you'll find in a 30's screwball comedy and there are some hilarious sight gags.  I loved it when Downey finds himself under the table with the pink-wigged girl.<br /><br />I did get lost in some of the plot twists but it didn't make any difference.  The three stars are so compelling that the plot just serves as a vehicle for watching them do their stuff.<br /><br />I hope this film gets the audience it deserves.  I had more genuine laughs here than at anything I've seen in quite a while.</p></body></html>

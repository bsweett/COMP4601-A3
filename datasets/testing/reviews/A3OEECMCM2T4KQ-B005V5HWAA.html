<meta name="summary" content="Costner makes come back in good film..."></head><body><p>When you finally decide the "serial killer" genre in film has exhausted possibly every avenue, another one comes along. Co-writer and sole director, Bruce A. Evans has created something a little original with this genre; a successful pillar of the community: loving husband, father, philanthropist, self-made man and apparently humble about his success; Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is not exactly what he seems to be because, like a lot of people, we have our addictions and like normal middle-class families, keep them from public view: alcohol, drugs, dangerous sporting activities and sex... et al. Mr. Brook's "addiction", however, is serial murder.<br /><br />Contrary to the fantasies of literature and film, most career criminals are stupid and usually spend the greater part of their lives in jail. Except those, of course, who work for powerful governments and trained in the art of subterfuge and murder in the name of patriotism. But normally, as the stats reveal, most murders, somewhere around 90%, are so-called crimes of passion or "drug-crazed" related. True pre-meditated murder, popularly known as "joy killing" or the other, assassination for hire, lies somewhere around 5 to 10%... Mr. Earl Brooks is addicted to joy killing and does it extremely well.<br /><br />The originality of Mr. Brooks is the character's alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt), who, like the "monkey on the back", prompts Brooks to commit more killings. Hurt is excellent in this role, pushing, seducing, persuasive and charming to pull Mr. Brooks into another random killing. The dialogue between Brooks and Hurt was performed with utter believability, giving this film-goer hope that Kevin Costner still has something to give us as an actor. Costner did not play Costner in this film but became the character of Mr. Brooks: our faith in this actor has now been restored.<br /><br />Despite the great acting talent, credit should go to writer's Evans & Gideon for a well paced and sharp script. To the point, dialogue without fillers, yet relevant at every turn of the plot. There was never a second in this film where it was thought: "Ok, c'mon people, get to the point." The audience sat captivated from start to surprise ending.<br /><br />Most reviews never focus on the finer aspects of a film. Conversely, the brilliant editing in this film by Miklos Wright was outstanding: tight, appropriate and right on the mark.<br /><br />One of the clever ironies of Mr. Brooks is that he attends AA Meetings to stop his "addiction" of murder. He goes and stands up and says, "Hi, I'm Earl and I'm an addict." The man never goes into his "story", however, which in real life would make fascinating listening. "Serial Killer's Anonymous"... now that would certainly be interesting.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is well acted, superbly executed and a great surprise.</p></body></html>

War Of The Worlds with a new twist. I do not understand what causes the overpaid reviewers to condemn so many of the sci-fi films of today and praise so many of the so called &quot;movies with a message&quot;. If entertainment is what you are looking for this is a great two hours of intense sci-fi action. Once again i have discovered what the reviews say is bad, i seem to enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cars"></head><body><p>Lightning McQueen (Wilson) is a rookie in a NASCAR type race called the Piston Cup.  When the season ends with him in a tie with his two major rivals, Chick Hicks (Keaton) and The King (Petty), he must head to California for a tie-breaker race.  Along the way, he ends up stranded in Radiator Springs, arrested for traffic violations.  Doc Hudson (Newman), the town judge, sentences him to repair the road before he can leave.  Initially, he just wants to get done and get out, but soon he finds himself making friends with the locals, including Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Sally (Hunt).  Soon, this cocky race car who had no real friends finds he may not want to leave so fast after all.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for "Cars", I was worried.  It did not look good, and I thought Pixar had its first flop on its hands.  Bumping the release date back six months did not ease my worry.  That being said, "Cars" is an excellent movie.  Pixar, I am sorry that I ever doubted you.  The voices are perfect, especially Wilson, Newman, and Larry the Cable Guy.  The film looks great, with bright colors kids will love.  The story is nice, and like many Pixar movies, focuses on friendship.  The only drawback I can find is that it runs a little long.  Still, it is worth seeing by kids of all ages.</p></body></html>

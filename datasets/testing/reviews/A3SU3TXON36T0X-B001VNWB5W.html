The film takes place in an alternate 1985 where Nixon has been elected for three terms and where Russia and the USA are about to engage in a massive nuclear war.  The "doomsday clock" is set at 5 until midnight.  Unfortunately that's all the movie offers.  The superhero characters are rather pathetic.  The only character that is even moderately interesting is the disturbed hero Rorschach.  The Dr. Manhattan character which everyone raves about is particularly stupid.  The film is disconnected, goes nowhere, and is utterly boring.  The ending with "The Smartest Man in the World" falls completely flat.  And, the homosexual undertones, rape scene, male nudity, and gratuitous sex scenes certainly aren't helping it any.  Ugh.  Ultimately I feel that it was pretty boring and not worthwhile.</p></body></html>

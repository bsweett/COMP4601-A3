<meta name="summary" content="Queen Elizabeth on Diana's Funeral"></head><body><p>Nothing could be me fitting to see a movie about British politics on the U.S.A. election day in the rain.  The title of this movie was deceptive as it concentrated almost exclusively on the week after Daian was killed in the car crash in Paris.  When I bought the ticket, I said "I have come to see the Queen."<br /><br />We met her (played superbly by Helen Mirren) on Tony Blair's first day in office.  After being elected as Prime Minister of Britain, he is shown down on his knee asking Queen Elizabeth's permission to be "her" Prime Minister.  It was a factitious meeting to say the least.<br /><br />The actor who portrasyed Blair was cute (showed a lot of teeth) and matured as the events occurred and he had to speak to the world on the family's behalf.  He was marvelous.  Diana died August 30, 1997, a lovely but deluded young woman who'd been ostracized by the royal family.  The monarchy watched t.v. like the rest of the world as they stayed in seclusion out in the country.  The Queen had deemed it a private Spenser family funeral, even though Charles had to remind her  of their responsibility, that Diana had been the loving mother of the future King of England.<br /><br />As the Queen finally came to terms that she must make an appearance by September 4th, as worldwide disapproval was increasing, she shed a few tears (as I did when my ex mother-in-law died) and a beautiful stag appeared as a prominition.  It showed her humanity, though the whole family were old fashioned and set in their ways:  harsh, uncaring, in denial, thinking only of themselves instead of the two sons of Diana.<br /><br />Blair carried on in a remarkably mature manner which won him many American admirers; almost ten years since those happenings, and he will retire in 2007.  He is almost as great now as Winston Churchill, even with his pajama top on which BLAIR was on the back.  He had a supportive wife and called Diana "the people's princess."  Plans were changed from private to a public funeral despite the Queen's cold attitute.<br /><br />It was very moving to see her looking at the mountain of flowers outside the gates of Balmoral Castle and to have her stand, "the flag," at half staff.  It was a minute-by-minute, day by day account of that terrible tragedy and repercussions in September, 1997.  We will always remember the televised coverage just as we watched the beautiful wedding some years prior, which led up to this miserable day, and the funeral proceedings of JFK in 1962.<br /><br />Some things are so remarkable that you can't get them erased from your memory, and the pain is always there.  I wasn't expecting this when I went to the movie, as I avoid painful memories in my subconscious as much as I can.  I could not see the 9-11 movie, but sometimes after we re-live emotional, painful situations there is a cleansing which is theraputic -- and this movie fits the bill in that aspect.  Go see it, or buy the video.  It is a good, though different, interpretation of how Diana was finally made a "Queen" in spirit.  Long Live The Queen in Heaven and on earth.</p></body></html>

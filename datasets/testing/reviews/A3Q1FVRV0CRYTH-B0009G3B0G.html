The story revolves around Jack (Brody), a Golf veteran who suffers a fatal wound in the war only to wake up after experiancing death having a dysfunctional memory.  A year after his death he meets a young girl and her mother after their car breaks down.  He fixes the car and forms a bond with the girl before he's chased away by the mother.  Then he hitches a ride from a cop killer and winds up taking the fall due to his unreliable memory and he's admitted into a pshyciatric ward.  This is where some crazy $#!+ goes down.  Kris Kristopherson plays a doctor experimenting with his patients, using some strange drugs and even stranger methods he has Jack strapped into a straight-jacket of sorts and contains him in a morgue drawer reserved for the dead.  Inside this drawer Jack begins to see the future, his future in the year 2007 (by the way this movie takes place in 1992) where he meets a woman named Jackie (played by Knightley in what may be her most complex and satisfying role to date) who claims that he is dead.  Jack Starks is dead.  He died Jan. 1st 1993.  It's Dec. 24th 1992.  "How much time to we have?"  "Not long."  The rest of the movie is an edge of your seat, what are they going to find, how did he die, can he prevent it type of thriller.  Jack has to make choices involving his life in 1992 that will change the outcome in 2007, if not for himself, for Jackie.  The film, the story, the overall feel of the film is exciting, while a little strange and very inprobable, but the acting on both Brody & Knightleys parts as well as great supporting rols in Kristopherson and Jennifer Jason Leigh.  This movie I believe is very underated and is actually a decent movie with decent thrills and charactors you care so much about that you disregard the flaws as minor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stiller and Wilson quite good in 70s satire"></head><body><p>I think the best word for "Starsky and Hutch" is 'serviceable'. It's reasonably funny, decently acted and directed, and, all and all, an entertaining way to spend an evening. It's neither the best nor the worst work the team of Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have done. [This is their sixth movie together.] One doesn't have to have any knowledge of the ancient TV series it is based on to enjoy it.<br /><br />Starsky [Stiller] and Hutch [Wilson] are two renegade cops who belong together. When first made partners, they don't much like each other, but, after awhile, they begin to care for each other in a classic 'male bonding' way. Their first big case involves a drug dealer [Vince Vaughn], who has figured out a novel way to smuggle and transport cocaine. As is always true in movies like this, they are stymied by the 'system' in pursuing their man, but they figure out 'novel' ways to overcome this problem. [Their 'novel' ways would land them in jail in real life!]<br /><br />The moviemakers wisely chose to make "Starsky and Hutch" a satire of the 70s rather than a replication of the TV show - a show most people only vaguely remember anyway.<br /><br />Some of the gags work, while others fall flat. Stiller and Wilson are always a pleasure to watch working together. Sometimes it's funny just to see them TRY so hard when a sketch is weak.</p></body></html>

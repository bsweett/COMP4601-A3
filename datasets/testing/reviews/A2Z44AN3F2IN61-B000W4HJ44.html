Her mother (John Travolta) cautions her against auditioning, wanting to spare her daughter the disappointment, but her father (Christopher Walken) encourages her to go for her dream.<br /><br />Tracy does get on the show, and her dancing and sparkling personality make her a big hit, much to the chagrin of the program manager (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants her own daughter to be the star.<br /><br />When Tracy finds out that the show's "Negro Day" is being canceled, she joins with Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) to protest segregation.<br /><br />There are some serious issues presented: racism, obesity, and the value of family, but it's overall a feel-good movie. The racists get their comeuppance, overweight Tracy gets the cute boy, and Wilbur and Edna Turnblad are solidly in love.<br /><br />The music is catchy and fun, and nearly irresistible. If I'd been watching it at home, I'd have been dancing.<br /><br />And the humor... when I wasn't dancing in my seat, I was laughing, or at least grinning. My cheeks hurt afterward, I was smiling and laughing so much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Journey to Jerusalem"></head><body><p>"Kingdom of Heaven" soars so far above our perception of an historical epic that it's not surprising it did poorly at the box office. However, it's good to see this two-disc DVD edition flying off retail and rental shelves. Muslims fighting invading Christians in the Middle East, the movie makes clearn, is not ancient history.<br /><br />There's no denying that this picture is a spectacular achievement. It has only one non-fatal flaw, the casting of Orlando Bloom in the lead. Nevertheless, that does not detract from the substance of director Ridley Scott's film, a controversial follow-up to his Oscar-inning "Gladiator."<br /><br />His subject is the Christian crusades into the Holy Land ("God wills it!") It ends with the siege of Jerusalem, prompting Richard the Lionhearted to launch yet another plundering crusade. Most of the characters are based on real figures and the actors are aware of that, especially a masked Edward Norton, unbilled as Baldwin the Leper King, and Jeremy Irons as his advisor.<br /><br />Only Bloom seems miscast; he isn't yet able to center a character or anchor a film, as Russell Crowe did "Gladiator." Eva Green is fetching as the king's sister, the fictional love interest and only that. Liam Neeson, Brendon Gleeson and others lend superior support.<br /><br />Scott's visuals are stunning: the windy port city of Messina, the entry into Jerusalem, and two battle sequences with sweeping views of opposing armies. Scott uses weather elements and streaming flags to enliven sequences. He actually explains how the technical defense of Jerusalem was executed. Scott is one of the few large scale directors (David Lean was another) able to make intimate moments between characters as meaningful as magnificent vistas. The extras are lackluster save for a lavish documentary that shows what an artistic and logistical accomplishment this film is, and how relevant it is today.<br /><br />Addendeum: A new director's cut of "Kingdom of Heaven" extends the narrative by an hour, expanding upon character and incident and accomplishing the rare feat of improving the original. Whole characters and their story lines are restored, and scenes are enlarged to the scale that Scott intended.</p></body></html>

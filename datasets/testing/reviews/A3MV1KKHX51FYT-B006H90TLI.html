<meta name="summary" content="A Drug Deal Gone Bad"></head><body><p>No Country for Old Men, 2007 film<br /><br />Sheriff Tom Bell had this job since age 25, and talks about his experiences. A deputy is attacked by a prisoner who gets away to kill a man. Another man hunts antelopes and sees a group of cars with dead bodies around them! A pickup truck there is filled with packages. He sees a dying lone man with a satchel full of $100 bills. A drug deal gone bad? He leaves with the satchel of money and returns home to his wife. After dark he returns to the crime scene. [A fatal mistake?] He is chased by men and a vicious dog. He runs away, then shoots the dog. A customer talks to a store owner on strange topics. At night men look over a car. The law is on the trail of a killer, and finds the drug deal scene with the bodies. The killer visits the trailer park to look for Llewelyn. So does the Sheriff. Moss looks for a place to hide that satchel - in an air conditioning duct! Telephone records leave a backtrail.<br /><br />That entry wound in the forehead left no bullet! Moss buys a shotgun, then returns to the motel. An electronic device is used to locate that satchel! [A lesson in found treasure?] But Moss escapes. A man is hired to search for that killer. Moss searches the satchel and finds that device. But someone is still on his trail! There is a silenced shooting. Night time shooting does not cause an alarm? Moss dumps that satchel by the border, then crosses the border to find a doctor. That killer stages an explosion so he can loot a pharmacy and steal medicine and supplies to treat wounds. Mr. Wells finds Moss in a hospital and bargains for the money; he warns him about that killer. The sheriff talks to Mrs. Moss about her husband. The killer finds Mr. Wells in his hotel and talks for a while. The killer knows where Moss is, and asks for the money.<br /><br />Crimes are detected when something happens to attract attention. Moss continues to hold on to that satchel. A friendly stranger helps an old woman with her suitcases. A man stops to help a stranded motorist. [It's the law in some states.] The Sheriff finds Moss at the motel after others have found him. He visits an old man to talk about quitting. Mrs. Moss finds an uninvited visitor in her home. He flips a coin, and leaves. There is an accident at a stoplight. The killer walks away, his arm in a sling. The Sheriff talks to his wife about his past life; he is now retired. And then the film ends!<br /><br />What happened to the rest of the story? Until this it was better than earlier Coen Bros. products because it was adapted from a successful novel. Do the Coen Bros. have a fatal flaw that prevents them from making a good product?<br /><br />This is a story about a chase for unearned wealth, like "The Maltese Falcon" but without the happy ending. There is a coldness to this story and its characters that seems unusual. Note the phrase "last man standing" in the beginning. Does this movie have any redeeming social value? The fatal flaw of Llewelyn was taking a satchel of money that didn't belong to him, and not reporting the dead bodies to the police. It brought grief and misery instead of promised joy. Then, he went back to that crime scene and got identified by the other criminals (who must have had night vision binoculars).</p></body></html>

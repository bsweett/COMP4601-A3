Snape says it is false. They will go after him next Saturday. The Auror Office can no longer protect him. Professor Snape says Harry will be taken to a safe house, the house of someone in The Order. He will be given every order of protection. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. Voldemort mentions he must be the one to kill Harry Potter, however, their wands are somehow the same.

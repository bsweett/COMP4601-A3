<meta name="summary" content="Better than the average sci-fi movie"></head><body><p>I, Robot in many ways is one of those kind of films that you're putting on going "oh man, wonder how much this is going to suck". Then again, you're dealing with Alex Proyas, director of such cult hits as the Crow and Dark City so even if it was bad, you'd at least now you were bound to watch something visually striking and at least cool. While it does have some trouble spots, I, Robot manages to at least be fun and engaging and worth an investment.<br /><br />It's the future and robotic technology has become increasingly sophisticated. A new model is being released but cop Del Spooner is absolutely convinced that robots will one day turn on us which is ridiculous to everyone since robots obey 3 laws: they can't hurt or allow a human to be harmed, to obey orders unless it conflicts with rule 1 and a robot protects itself if it doesn't conflict with rules 1 and 2. After the main developer of the robots dies under a suspected suicide, Spooner thinks otherwise and with the help of a gorgeous scientist, he tries to figure out what's going on with the robots.<br /><br />After the gothic-flavored the Crow and the film noir look of Dark City, director Proyas now goes for the sleek futuristic style and it works quite well. While it does seem like a nerd thinking up futuristic stuff instead of going for realism, like Spielberg's extensive research in a possible future for Minority Report, it does have a great look and certain technologies look great such as the cars. The effects are pretty stellar, in particular the robots where dozens and in one shots what looks like near a thousand or so appear on screen. The one problem is that there's a couple action scenes that were obviously added so it wouldn't just be this thinking sci-fi movie. Granted the scenes are great, including an attack on a car in motion and a demolition happening while one's inside the house are great but they also feel added to appease the blockbuster going crowd.<br /><br />I think Will Smith is one of those kind of actors where Will just can't help being Will. Not going after his acting, far from it (in fact, there's some great scenes he has here) but you can't get past moments that make you think of the wisecracking Fresh Prince. Underutilized James Cromwell is always excellent and while not really given much range, Bridget Moynahan is just so cuuute. The real star personally is actually just a voice but Alan Tudyk(Wash from Firefly/Serenity) supplies the voice of Sunny, a robot who's been given an actual personality and he pulls it off admirably. The only thing is certain characters just seem kind of useless. Shia LeBeouf's role for example just seems kind of pointless since it just doesn't go anywhere, same with Spooner's grandmother role.<br /><br />Is it Proyas's best? No, for me that's the Crow and this is actually the only film that I probably wouldn't get despite done by an emerging talent. It's not a terrible movie by any means but after downsizing movies I've owned over the years, I can look at this one and go "yeah I enjoyed it but I doubt I'd watch it again".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""And in other news, THE DEAD WALK THE EARTH!""></head><body><p>I have been looking forward to seeing "Corpse Bride" ever since I learned that it was in production. I was not disappointed...Tim Burton always makes amazing films, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />The animated tale revolves around Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp), a young and somewhat jumpy young man who is betrothed to Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson), a girl he's never even met before. The parents of the newlyweds-to-be are both hoping that the union of their children will better their own reputations and ease their financial burdens. Victor and Victoria finally meet and are pleasantly surprised to discover that they actually like each other. When Victor botches the wedding rehearsal, he rushes out into the woods to practice his wedding vows. He places Victoria's wedding ring on a tree branch, which suddenly grips his hand and emerges from the earth attached to a corpse bride (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter). She takes the unwilling Victor to her home, the land of the undead, which exists beneath the surface of the earth. Victor struggles with his new bride while poor Victoria must cope with the evil man her parents have found to fill in for Victor at the wedding ceremony.<br /><br />The animation in "Corpse Bride" is phenomenal...if this movie doesn't win the Best Animated Feature category at the Academy Awards, I'll be furious! But the animation isn't the only amazing thing about this movie. The storyline is fun (and perhaps slightly predictable, but what can you do?) and the characters are extremely well-developed. There are several musical numbers in this film, all of which are very enjoyable. (I especially enjoyed the skeleton jazz band!) I guess the only complaint I have is that I wish it was a slightly darker film. Burton is famous for his extreme creepiness...I was basically expecting to see an animated version of "Sleepy Hollow," but this is much more along the lines of "The Nightmare Before Christmas," which was an amazing Burton movie but is still geared toward children. There's nothing wrong with that, of course...it's just that I'm an adult and I prefer Burton when he's at his most macabre. :)<br /><br />Overall, "Corpse Bride" is a wonderful film. It's a great movie to take the kids to see before Halloween, but adults who are fans of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will enjoy it as well.</p></body></html>

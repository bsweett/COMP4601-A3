<meta name="summary" content="Extremely interesting horror film, though perhaps a bit too original for its own good"></head><body><p>There were a lot of things that I really loved about this movie and a fair number that I did not.  All horror films work within a framework and the most successful of them are original within that framework, not by busting it up.  It is like a competitor in a high diving contest.  If you completely alter form you will get a damning grade.<br /><br />One reviewer described this as a satire.  I think he is mistaking comical elements for satire; the overall form of this film is definitely not satirical.  It is definitely trying to stay within the bounds of the horror film while trying to stretch some of its limits.  For instance, one of the rules in monster movies is that you don't show the monster too soon or too well.  But here the monster is shown only a few minutes into the film and then with great clarity.  You see exactly what it looks like almost as soon as you see it for the first time.  I wasn't too troubled by this because the monster was interestingly and uniquely portrayed.  I was a bit more bothered by the frequent injection of farce (which is what I think the reviewer I mentioned before mistook for satire).  I think comedy properly timed can do a great deal to ease tension and make for a better film, but at times this film almost degenerated into slapstick.  Another traditional element -- and one with which it clashes because of the farce, which almost seems to promise a happy ending -- is the idea of winning.  Every monster movie has to end with a sense of a win.  Few really great monster movies end with all the principle characters dead.  Here most of the characters survive, but the two we care most for in the course of the narrative do not.  At the end of the film it didn't, to me, feel like a "win."  I felt that the monster won.<br /><br />Still, there were a lot of riveting moments in the film.  The locale in Seoul was truly creepy and eerie.  The camera work was simply breathtaking and was as important in establishing the mood of the film as the locale or the special effects (it was shot in high def video instead of film, a practice embraced not only by a number of television series like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but more and more movies).  The monster itself was simply amazing.  I wasn't completely thrilled with its appearance, but there is no questioning how convincing it looked.  It was perhaps the most impressive large monster (except perhaps for Peter Jackson's Kong) that I've seen in a movie.<br /><br />Still, despite the good things, the persistent farcical elements and the "feel bad" ending kept me from liking this as much as I would have liked.  With some tweaking, it could have become a classic.</p></body></html>

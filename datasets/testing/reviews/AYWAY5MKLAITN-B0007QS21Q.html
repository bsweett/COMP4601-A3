No one is quite sure why a robot, which is three laws safe, just all of a sudden murders someone. And that's why the film's protaganist has to be a robot hater. It's a turmoil of mixing one's job with one's dislikes. But the robot creates a sympathetic demeanor which gives way to numerous questions. Can robots lie? Are they learning new tricks? More importantly, what are they after besides our acceptance. From the same man who brought you Dark City comes a sci-fi rush to the finish line that will leav you aching for more. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

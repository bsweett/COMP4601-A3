<meta name="summary" content="Overrated Thriller (set in an always-rainy city)"></head><body><p>Maybe I am spoiled having seen the entertaining and taut "The Silence of the Lambs". Maybe serial killer thrillers will never measure up to that one. I can't dismiss "Se7en" completely, but I did find it overrated. It's been praised often and by many. Sure, it's atmospheric and gruesome, but so is most familys' junk drawer.<br /><br />Rain looks good in movies. It enhances the mood in film noir, in romance, in horror, in suspense, and in detective tales. But this is ridiculous excess. In a constantly rainy metropolis, we learn about this madman who has been inspired by the seven deadly sins. This detective yarn becomes predictable as it progresses. By the ending you can figure out what's about to go down.<br /><br />I do wish the screenplay was better; the relationship between the two main characters could have been really well defined, even witty and clever. Instead we get the 'same-old same-old' detective partners: wise one and reckless one. It's been done a bajillion times.<br /><br />Of course the production design was fairly effective-- but you expect that in a film like this anyway (and style doesn't win me over much if the story doesn't enthrall me at all). And the score by Howard Shore was good. But overall this is the sort of thriller that I see once and then have no wish to view again. It just didn't live up to the praise, for me personally.<br /><br />Bottom line: Worth a rental if you never saw it.</p></body></html>

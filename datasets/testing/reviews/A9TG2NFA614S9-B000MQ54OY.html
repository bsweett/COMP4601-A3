<meta name="summary" content="The Penguin Who Tap Danced"></head><body><p>"Happy Feet" is a feel good animated movie musical about an Emperor penguin who can't sing at all unlike the rest of his colony. He's an outcast who is a terrific tap dancer. Having seen Savion Glover perform his tap dancing feats on the stage, I knew he was the one whose idiosyncratic dancing style was used as the model for Mumble, the dancing penguin.<br /> People should see this movie in tandem with "March of the Penguins," the documentary about real penguins, so they can see how carefully the makers of this movie were in portraying accurately the behavioral traits of penguins. Real people appear in later scenes of the movie because human beings are endangering the penguin population by overfishing in the Antarctica and elsewhere. Mumble, of course, has to stop them from this anti-penguin activity.<br /> Mumble is the proverbial outsider, the loner who can't do what his brethren can do. After being ostracized from his own colony he joins five Adelie penguins and one Rockhopper penguin who happens to have the voice of Robin Williams. The swimming sequences and the run-in's with predators add excitement to the film. Thousands of computerized, animated penguins are shown in singing or dance segments. Few viewers are going to be bored by this film that won an Academy Award in 2007 for best animated feature. It's entertaining, fun, not overly long, and a hoot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deep, understated film that works on several levels. Extras are fantastic"></head><body><p>If there is one thing I love about M. Night Shamalayan's films, it is that they generally work on several levels, are thought provoking, and don't rely on generic material to tell a story. Sure, viewers of his films now look for the "twist" at the conclusion (thanks to The Sixth Sense), but there is so much more to the viewing experience that we shouldn't judge a film solely on its conclusion (like many did in The Village). Unbreakable is such a film that works on many levels, and has a symbolic, yet human aspect to it.<br /><br />The first time I saw Unbreakable at the movies, it just struck me as a strange flick, seemingly slow-moving but telling a tale of two vastly different characters. Years later, having seen the film several times since, I have a love and appreciation for this film and its depth. The film itself works as a sort of comic book story told in human form. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man who has had the remarkable fortune to been the sole survivor of a terrible train wreck. He's also never been sick in his life. You might say that, despite his fortunate moment, David is a pretty normal guy, with an uneventful, yet somewhat conflicted life. He works as a security guard at a stadium, but has had marital problems and isn't as happy as he could be with life. Shamalayan brings a real human, everyday quality to David, who comes to the realization that larger forces may be at work in his life. David's ho-hum existence will be interrupted by the man who really is his opposite, Elijah Price. Elijah (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson), is David's antithesis. Nicknamed "Mr. Glass", Elijah is prone to injury, sickness, uses a cane to walk; he is eccentric, odd and strange, and has a fanatic, obsessive streak about comics. Elijah is quite obsessed with David's ability to survive and sees an almost superhuman relevance to his existence. It will become evident to David only later what this encounter with the strange man means, as several conflicts surface.<br /><br />Unbreakable incorporates an understated level within its telling, but it is masterful in building both a symbolic and literal level of storytelling. On one side is the comic book angle of good vs. evil; both sides exist in the world and seem to balance each other out. Each of the two main characters, David and Elijah, represent these two angles. The story that is told from David's point of view brings with it a simple, but readily identifiable theme: we each have a gift, and we need to use it for the common good. One aspect of Unbreakable is really just David finding his identify and existence in the world. The scenery, visuals, colors all enhance the experience of watching as well.<br /><br />If there is one drawback, it is the ending, which other reviewers have noted. I don't fault it on its intentional or unintentional supposed "twist", but rather that it was just rushed and not thought out. The ending seemingly kills the momentum of an otherwise deep film.<br /><br />Still, I think that the film is excellent, and the DVD gives you fantastic extras which give background into the story of Unbreakable and the cast, but more importantly, put much of the film in perspective. Well worth the purchase.<br /><br />4 stars for the film, but 5 for the entire DVD package.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Superman movies"></head><body><p>Roger Ebert gave the first Batman 2 stars and he's wrong again with Superman Returns which he also gave 2 stars. It's a great ride and it brings back the kid in you just in the opening credits and hearing the John Williams classic musical score. Superman returns after 5 years of looking for any piece of Krypton that he can find. He returns to find Lois engaged to Perry White's son played by James Marsden (X-Men) and with a kid as well. He finds himself needed again just when he's settiling in. Lex Luther has an evil plan to basically turn Earth into Krypton in a world where he'd be the leader.<br /><br />  This movie is 10 times better than Superman 3 and 4. It's not better than part 1 or 2 but it's right up there with them at least. Brandon Routh may not be as good as Christopher Reeves as playing Clark Kent or Superman. However he is the best Superman next to Reeves. Routh's Superman looks like he popped right out of the comic book. He may not have Reeves' charm but he still makes a very heroic Superman. As for playing a bumbling reporter, he needs to work on that a lot before the next movies. Ebert was way off though when he said he barely had any lines because they probably dind't know if he could act. Routh has a good part at the end where he delivers the lines that were once said to him by his father. He does it well too.<br /><br />  Kate Bosworth's Lois is more vulnerable than the kind of Lois we're used to. I mean she gets knocked around violently by one of Lex's bodyguards. You know the Erica Durance Lois in Smallville wouldn't take that [...]. Erica Durance is a very good Lois and it's sad that Smallville is only interested in pushing Lana in our face constantly and they don't  know how to use Lois. Anyway Bosworth still looks the part at least and does give us a different Lois even if it's not a better Lois.<br /><br />  Kevin Spacey is excellent as Lex Luther, he basically gives us an older version of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex in Smallville. Gene Hackman was a great Lex Luther too but his was a little too whacky. Spacey makes a great ruthless and scary Luther and it's one of his best performances in awhile. Parker Posey is also excellent as his partner Kitty. She livened up movies that weren't that good, like Scream 3 and Blade Trinity. Here she's finally in a good a movie and has really good chemestry with Spacey. Hell they have better chemestry than Routh and Bosworth who don't have Reeves and Margot Kidder chemestry.<br /><br />  One problem with the film is that....Lois Lane and Clark never work together. She never even wonders why Clark isn't around when Superman is around. It is funny though when Lois and her fiance joke about how Clark and Superman have the same height and built. Plus although Spacey is a great Lex Luther, I am sort of Lex Luthered out. I know part 3 sucked when it tried to have someone other than Luther as the villian. But I'd love to see Darkseid in a Superman movie for once . They need someone evil with powers like part 2 had Zod. I'd like something like that instead of just Luther as the villian again. It's still hard not to get into this movie though or get excited when you hear the John Williams score.</p></body></html>

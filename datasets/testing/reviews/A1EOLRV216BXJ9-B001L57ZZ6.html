Instead this is an action packed movie with an intense and original plot unrevealing the series of events that happened in hours, not days.<br /><br />The movie succeeded in delivering action scenes of machines and technologies (rather than of man) one expects to see in a truly science fiction. The destruction hands of the cranes and of the powerlines are two most impressive ones in the movie. Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are excellent in portraying the "pawns" of the brain behind the secret - they are intelligent, sharp and being involuntarily involved in the big conspiracy exhibit a strong sense of helplessness and hence develop a convincibly strong bond with one another. One can feel their pressing need to survive and use all the wits one gets to figure out what comes next.<br /><br />It's thus a delight to watch an action packed movie which is fluid in story telling, mind provoking and unorthodox. You can actually sit back with your mind totally immersed in the movie for a couple of hours. Surprise and suspence, not romance, are abundant. Yet it does not make the movie anything less than what it should be. Very worth watching.</p></body></html>

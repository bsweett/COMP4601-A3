<meta name="summary" content="Stewart +Novak=Perfection"></head><body><p>James Stewart plays a retired cop who quit because his vertigo caused a co-worker's death. An old school chum hires him to tail his wife. She believes she is a Spanish woman named Carlotta who lived over a hundred years ago and came to a bad end.  She tries to kill herself by jumping into San Francisco Bay, Stewart saves her, and falls in love with her. They try to solve the mystery of her so-called possession by visiting the tiny mission town where Carlotta lived, but there is a shocking accident...<p>James Stewart is wonderful as the obsessed and heartbroken detective.  He is tender, haunted, and desperatly in love with a woman he doesn't reallly know.  Kim Novak is excellent in the dual role of the school chum's classy wife and a very brassy shopgirl. The writing is great:  you really care about the characters.  The soundtrack sets the mood for the film:  suspenseful and shocking.  If you like romance, mystery, and suspense, Vertigo is for you.</p></body></html>

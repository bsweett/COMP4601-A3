<meta name="summary" content="A fun but not compelling horror film"></head><body><p>Two reasons I wanted to see this film.  I like the films of George A Romero who made the original version of this film.  And I like Timothy Olyphant's new show.<br /><br />The Crazies is about a town that goes homicidal after a medical plane crashes nearby and infects their water supply with a designer virus.  There are two real problems with the film, first is they spend no time establishing the characters.  They give you just introduce the supporting characters before their crazy scene.  Second, plot twist are derived only to create the next crazy attack.<br /><br />Now with that said, it is an average fun horror film.  But I would say rent it or wait for it to hit cable.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />Audio Commentary with the director<br /><br />Behind the Scenes with Director Breck Eisner - an iteresting making of with the director, cast and others.<br /><br />George Romeo tribute - an interesting featurette about Romero.  (The frightening part is the horror genre people talking.  It really reinforces the geek horror image.)<br /><br />Make-up mastermind-Rob Hall: A featurette showing how one Crazie is made.<br /><br />The Crazies Motion Comic Episodes 1&2 - These actually give some background on two of the incidents in the film but are really hard to follow.<br /><br />Visual Effects in Motion - Storyboarding of a few scenes from live shot to CGI additions to final shot.</p></body></html>

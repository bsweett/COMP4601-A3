I've been a huge fan of epics, everything from Ben-Hur to Gladiator & Troy, and even King Arthur was entertaining.  I'm a fan of Colin, Jolie & Hopkins so I decided that Alexander, although bashed by every critic, would still be worth my time.  I'm sad to say I was wrong.  I feel that Oliver should have focused of the greater aspects of Alexanders life, like his rise to power, instead of throwing us into the middle of his reign and spending way too much time letting us know he would rather sleep with his friend (played way too femininely by Jared Leto) than his wife.  I felt the acting was lacking, all except Colin.  I felt he did very well.  I feel bad that he was bashed so much for this performance for I felt he was the only part of the movie that remained memerable.  I thought he deserved an oscar nod, although I would have chosen Johny Depp over Colin to walk away with the golden man.  The battle scenes were also very dissapointing.  First of all, you have a three hour movie about the most powerful warrior in the world and there are only about twenty minutes tops worth of battle time...thats just bad judgment on Oliver's part.  The battle scenes themselves were lacking.  The first against the Medes & Persians was a complete mess...the battle scenes in Troy were far superior as was the battle scene in the beginning of Gladiator.  The last scene with the Elephants was the most anticipated scene of the movie for me and it left me bitter.  It could have been sooooo much better.  I read that the battle scene was distroyed going through an x-ray and they were only able to salvage some of the battle, but still, it wouldn't have saved the movie from impending doom.  I don't feel I could watch it again.  The sex scene was steamy, in a funny, laugh out loud kinda way... Overall I give it a 3 ONLY because I feel that Colin deserves that, you know, for trying...</p></body></html>

Neeson plays a retired spy, Maggie Grace plays Neeson's daughter. The daughter and her girlfriend leave on a trip across Europe against the better judgement of her dad (Neeson). They barely land in Paris when they are kidnapped by slave traders. With few clues, Daddy goes to Paris to recover his daughter. Simple plot idea, extremely well executed (hence my shout-out to Neeson). This is a violent and tough movie; Neeson's body count is around 50 and most with graphic and quick kills. Don't shoot at him, you'll only make him mad! Impressive how he follows from clue to clue. If you don't mind the violence and the graphic underworld plot, it is a great movie. I do recommend it and will watch it again in the future.</p></body></html>

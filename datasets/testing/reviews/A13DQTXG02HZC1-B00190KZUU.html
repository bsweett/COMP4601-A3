<meta name="summary" content="How True!"></head><body><p>Nowadays, it's rather common for companies to produce movies about misunderstood children and the plutonic relationships with their parents.  This movie turned it the other way around, of the son refusing to take his father as he was &amp; subconsciously disowned him as none of them shared the same identity.  In the end, as the father was facing his inevitable death from terminal illness, the son finally came to term and reconciled with the demon that haunted him for years.  As viewers sat through the movie, in the end, we would understand the significance of the title, &quot;The Big Fish&quot;.  The bottom line is things are as they are.  As simple as that.  I could emphatise with this movie as I am having the same kind of relationship with my dad.  It's difficult to come to term with the fact that we are so different from one another but in the end, we simply have to learn to let go, clinging for the impossibility that perhaps, my dad happens to pretend to be someone that he's not.  I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's movies as his vision is second to none and distinctly his.  Other than his disappointment in Planet of the Apes, Tim Burton is arguably one of the most creative Director I truly appreciate.  By looking at the additional features in DVD, I could sense that this project is a very personal one for him.  One could also say that this movie is not as dark &amp; as bleak as his previous offerings and perhaps, it has something to do with his new life with Helen Bonham Carter who played different characters in this movie.  One could also catch a glimpse of the writer of &quot;The Big Fish&quot; as an Economics lecturer as a cameo appearance!  Overall, a very heart moving movie with strong performances by Albert Finney, Danny de Vito, Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor.  Then, there are also three Oscar winners in the production crew such as costume designer, director of cinematography, special effects designer Stan Winston.  Definitely bang for your buck.  Timeless and appealing to all ages.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

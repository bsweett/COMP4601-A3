I do feel they could have utilized all these comedic talents to a much greater extent, but I got a good dozen or so laughs out of this one, as did the audience I saw it with. The homosexual humor was used a little too much and some of the jokes did fall quite flat.  Overall, Wild Hogs makes me want to cut work for a week and take a trip across the country.</p></body></html>

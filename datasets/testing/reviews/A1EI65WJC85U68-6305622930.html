This segment alone is enough to convince viewers that Scott deserved his Oscar- even if he himself didn't want it. He gives a superlative performance as the hard-assed and fearless General who is the only US General truly feared by the Nazis: Ironic considering Patton  had his nose shot off by the Germans. The man thinks nothing of shooting fatigued pack horses and dumping them into a river because they no longer serve their purpose to him. But although he is referred to by his men as "old blood-and-guts" ("Our blood, his guts") Patton still manages to hide an almost fatherly love towards them (the scene where Patton tends a wounded soldier in hospital and then reverts to his hard-nose self and begins beating up on the poor guy for being a coward. And later in fearless mode to one of his superiors "I shaved very close this morning, in preparation of getting smacked by you".<br />The battle sequences are well staged. In fact not a single frame of PATTON's 2 1/2 hours that doesn't detract the viewer's interest. If high school history had been this interesting, maybe I would have passed.<br />My only complaints with the movie: What's with the stupid intermission two-thirds of the way through the film? And second, it seems Jerry Goldsmith later recycled a portion of his score for the POLICE ACADEMY movies. Now if that isn't an insult to cinema history, then what is?</p></body></html>

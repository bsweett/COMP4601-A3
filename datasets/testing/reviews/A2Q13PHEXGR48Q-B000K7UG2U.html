I didn't think the original movie could be remade, but director Jonathan Demme has succeeded.  During the Gulf War in Kuwait, Sergeant Raymond Shaw saves his squad during an ambush and receives a Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery.  Twelve years later, he becomes the Vice Presidential candidate in the presidential elections.  His commander during the Gulf War, Maj. Bennet Marco, has been having flashbacks about what he thinks really happened during the ambush and in the days afterwards.  Marco begins to investigate his nigtmares, and finds a huge conspiracy invovling politicians, terrorists, and mulit-conglamorate corporations.  What makes this movie good is that it does not try to be an exact duplicate of the original.  The basic storyline is the same as the 1962 classic with little twists and turns throughout, especially the ending, that keeps the viewer interested. The 2004 version is an excellent movie that can stand on its own and is almost as good as the original.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />  Denzel Washington is excellent, when isn't he?, as Major Bennet Marco, the Gulf War veteran trying to find out what really happened on that night in Kuwait.  Washington is very believable as a veteran struggling with post-war traumatic stress.  Meryl Streep plays Senator Eleanor Shaw, Raymond's mother, who has more than a few aces up her sleeve.  Watching her transformation as the plot reveals itself is creepy, although not as good as Angela Lansbury's performance.  Liev Schrieber stars as Congressman Raymond Shaw, the Vice Presidential Candidate who wants to believe what Marco tells him, but ultimately cannot.  Jon Voight also stars as rival senator Thomas Jordan, who Marco confides in.  The movie also stars Kimberly Elise, Ted Levine, Miguel Ferrer, Simon McBurney, and Bruno Ganz.  For an exciting, suspenseful thriller with an impressive cast and excellent story, check out The Manchurian Candidate!</p></body></html>

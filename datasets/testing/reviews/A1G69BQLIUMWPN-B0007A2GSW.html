<meta name="summary" content="Cute...but not your Toy Story..."></head><body><p>I had extremely high expectations for this movie and it just did not live up to them.  I thought the movie was cute and it was funny.  But, I didn't feel it captivated me like the other Pixar movies did.  I would never discourage anyone from seeing this movie, because the people I went with loved it.  Yet, for me it was not what I personally expected.</p></body></html>

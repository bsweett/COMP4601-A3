<meta name="summary" content="Relatable War Film"></head><body><p>Jarhead is not a typical war film. It focuses on how life changes when you go to war, not on the war itself. Instead of constantly seeing battle scenes and death, we see what is a little more important, the humanity of the soldiers and their transformation as people. We see training, goofing off, suspicions of unfaithful girlfriends at home, mental anguish, and soldiers in a war who do not know why they are fighting.<br /><br />The film is incredibly fluid and incredibly powerful all until the very last scene. All of the dialogue seems natural even if the words are clich&eacute;. They ring true. However, the very last scene seems forced as if the writer wanted to wrap up the film neatly. It was not done well.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is great as the main character Swoffard. He brings raw emotionalism to the screen. He plays the character in a way that everyone can understand and relate to. His performance is key to the film because it makes the story seem personal.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is surprisingly good in his role as the Staff Sergeant. He is real, raw, and relatable. He shows both the aggression and strength of a military official and the frankness and dynamic personality of a regular citizen.<br /><br />Although the film takes place in the desert, the scenery is gorgeous. Chopping this film up to fit a television screen will hinder it enormously. The widescreen is employed beautifully. One of the most poignant scenes in the film is where the oil wells are burnt. The sky is black, there is oil falling from the sky like rain, and and the soldiers look around at hell. The scenery is so vivid and striking; it is unsettling in an extremely effective way.<br /><br />The music in this film is also utilized to great effect. Songs are never distracting to the film; they always fit the scenes to illustrate them but never to overpower them.<br /><br />This film leaves the audience with an overall feeling of sadness. These men lost their former lives in a war that lasted only a few days. The audience is brought into that struggle and that loss, leaving with a feeling similar to that of those involved. This is a thought provoking film.</p></body></html>

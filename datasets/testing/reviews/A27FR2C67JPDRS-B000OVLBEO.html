(I was a DC comics kid)  But the previews for the film looked entertaining so I decided I'd give the movie a try.  What I found was a pleasant surprise!  A good story with great effects and a role that fits Nicholas Cage quite nicely.<br /><br />The story revolves around a young man named Johnny Blaze, who along with his father performed a daredevil motorcycle act at carnivals.  When his father becomes terminally ill, Johnny strikes a deal with a stranger, who turns out to be Mephistopholes (the devil) played in a deliciously evil turn by Peter Fonda.  The deal awards the elder Blaze a miraculous recovery and in return the young man's soul is given as payment in the tradeoff.  Of course, a deal with the devil is never a good thing.  Mephistopholes tells the young man that when the time comes he will return asking for a favor.<br /><br />Years down the road, Johnny Blaze as an adult is now a daredevil motocyclist with superstart status.  Enter Blackheart, the vicious son of Mephistopholes, who wants to dethrone his father as the leader of hell.  Both demons want a contract binding thousands of souls of small town that was stole by a previous "Ghost Rider" or devil's bounty hunter.  With the doomed souls of the thousand villagers, Blackheart can usurp his father's power and turn his malicious sights toward the earth as a new kingdom.<br /><br />With the aid of the the former Ghost Rider, Johnny learns about his sudden transformation (flaming skull and all!) and begins a fight between the royality of hell.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage does a nice job as the reluctant hero, who with his new found powers can see the guilt of criminals and turn the pain of their victims against them.  Sam Elliot does well in his role as the "retiring" Ghost Rider and Eva Mendes is Roxy, the girl that young Johnny left after a tragic event in his past.  Wes Bentley is very good as the dark, murderious Blackheart..he makes a good villain.<br /><br />Overall the film is an enjoyable popcorn flick that is bound to entertain.  If you are a fan of the comic book, you may feel differently---I don't know how closely the director and writers followed the character and origin of the Ghost Rider.  But for people like me, who know nothing, I think you will enjoy the film.  Good fare and worth watching!</p></body></html>

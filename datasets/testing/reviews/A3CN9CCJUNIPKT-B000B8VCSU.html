<meta name="summary" content="+1/2.  A groundbreaking but poorly realized rap film"></head><body><p>A disapppointing film about the underground culture of rap battles, modern versions of doin' the dozens that many aspiring MCs dream will make them stars.  Speaking charitably, I don't think it was the fault of ultra-charismatic rapper Eminem that he was cast in the role of Ron Howard in this inner-city update of "American Graffiti," but it's still a shame that the weak script and sluggish direction didn't provide better opportunities for him to explore his acting range. While the messed-up, derelict trashiness of the blight-striken 'hoods of Detroit is shown with crisp, gritty detail, the social nuances of the hip-hop scene are reduced to a near-cartoonish simplicity, in which Eminem (as "B. Rabbit," his character's street name) and his too-goofy crew run up against the obnoxious swaggering of the Free World, a musical group that has already made it, and lords it over the rest of the scene.  Too much time is spent building up numerous plot points that show how desperate and depressing Rabbit's life is -- the movie simply bogs down, and if we could have seen about half as much of this stuff, and about three times as much actual rapping, things would have been much, much better.  While "8 Mile" probably succeeds in making underground hip-hop culture accessible to mainstream America, it probably would have been a better movie had it been played a little tougher.  Several aspects of this film rang false, particularly the overly-likeable Fat Albert gang that Rabbit hangs out with, and the gratuitously [promiscous] scenes with his new girlfriend, played by Brittany Murphy, as well as the unfortunate absence of a wall-to-wall, booming soundtrack.  The film does access a hidden culture, but it does so at the expense of subtlety and directorial finesse.  It's surprising that Chris Hanson, who made a taut thriller like "LA Confidential," could let such a juicy story like this lapse into tedium.  Plus, what a drag that Mekhi Phifer (the aptly-named Dr. Pratt, of TV's "E.R.") was cast as Em's best bud... Phifer is one of the most leaden and overly-obvious actors around; couldn't they have found *anyone* who would be more fun to watch for two hours?  Anyway, I guess that while this wasn't the dramatic breakthrough for Eminem that many reviewers said it was, that it's still an okay film.  If nothing else, in his climactic rap-battle scene, he got the opportunity to present his blueprint for how white kids who are into rap can diffuse the race-baiting of their critics: look 'em in the eye and say, "Yeah, so?  What's your point?" It would have been nice if the other 110 minutes of this film offered as much of a message, but I guess you can't ask for everything.</p></body></html>

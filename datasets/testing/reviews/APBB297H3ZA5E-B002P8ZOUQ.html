<meta name="summary" content="The best of the Xmen Films"></head><body><p>1. I like most have watched the prior 3 Xmen DVDs and this is the best by far.<br /><br />2. Unlike the other films, this film is focused solely on Wolverine and thus the writing / storyline is much more in depth and sophisticated.  In many ways it's akin to Batman Begins.  A definite must see for all Xmen fans.</p></body></html>

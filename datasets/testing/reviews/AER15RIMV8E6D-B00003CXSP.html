Hannibal has been hiding in Italy from Clarice and anyone else who is looking for him. A dirty cop named Pazzi finds out who he is and tries to get the reward for his capture. Mason Verger wants revenge for what Hannibal made him do, and Clarice just wants to find him and put him in prison. If you love cop thrillers, and the Hannibal movies, you'll love HANNIBAL!!!</p></body></html>

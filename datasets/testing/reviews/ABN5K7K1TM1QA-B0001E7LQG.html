<meta name="summary" content="Fifty- (or maybe sixty-) something chick  flick fantasy"></head><body><p>Let's see: Erica Berry (played full out by Diane Keaton in a role to die for) is a successful playwright with a beautiful daughter (Amanda Peet) and at least one very fine bosom buddy (Frances McDormand).  Along comes Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson, 66) in his PJ's or underwear-I forget which--to be discovered behind the opened door of her refrigerator ("Boy Meets Girl--Cute," as they say in Hollywood).  Turns out he is dating her twenysomething daughter Marin.  Well, gee, what a guy.<br /><br />However daughter and man about town have not yet consummated their relationship; indeed when they try, Viagra Harry has a heart attack.  And now the plot thickens.  Enter handsome, dashing, young and very eligible Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) who tells Harry that he can't go anywhere yet because they need to keep a close watch on his heart.  So Erica ends up babysitting him.  Ah, yes we can see where this one is going.  Playboy of the Western World finally but finally gives up the young stuff, meets the love of his life (Erica), and falls clumsily, but hopelessly in love with her.<br /><br />For Erica, who hasn't felt a man's touch for lo these many years, it's like electrifying.  Ah, but here's the rub.  The old bachelor can't comprehend his feelings.  After all he has never but never dated anyone over thirty before, and the prospect of COMMITMENT is way scary.  So he demurs, shall we say.  Meanwhile, the dashing young doctor reveals his romantic and clearly carnal interest in--no, NOT the beautiful young daughter!  How prosaic would that be?  No, he reveals he has quite a yen for the great playwright herself, and age does not matter in the slightest!<br /><br />Okay, at this point if I were a woman of any age I would say that my cup doth runneth over.  I would also suspect that this Fantasyland is a bit much for belief.  But hey, why should the starlets have all the fun?<br /><br />Anyway, Nancy Meyers's direction of this self-authored fairytale will appeal to its targeted audience no doubt, but don't try to screen this for your boyfriend.  He won't survive the first reel.<br /><br />Incidentally, this flick is not even in the same league as the somewhat similar romantic comedy, As Good As It Gets (1997) starring Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, which I recommend that you see instead.  Jack and Diane give it their best here-and Keaton is very good--but the lame and cloying script defeats their efforts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The most unique love story of the year!"></head><body><p>"The Lake House" is the best romance/love story since "The Notebook" with Ryan Gosling & Rachel McAdams. Keanu Reeves and the always lovely Sandra Bullock star together for the first time since the action blockbuster "Speed". He (Keanu) lives in 2004, she (Sandra) lives in 2006. A divine intervention allows them to correspond with each other through U.S. mail. Both are completely in disbelief at first but, when certain things become clear they realize that the impossible is in fact taking place. Eventually they plan to meet in person, while Bullock shows.. for some unknown reason Reeves does not. Bullock decides to forget about him not understanding why he didnt show up. Later we discover why he wasnt there and the story unfolds when we realize she will be the one that has to change events that have already happened in Reeves time but, could be altered in Bullock's present time. "The Lake House" has you really wanting these two stars to meet in present time. I think it's sweet and original and, I recommend it to all adults that have ever been in love or long to be.</p></body></html>

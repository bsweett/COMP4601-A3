<meta name="summary" content="My first exposure to John Constantine's world....mm"></head><body><p>THis is my first exposure to "Hellblazer" and I genuinely like it.  I realize the film may not compare to the comic book, but I am judging the film alone.  As far as I am concerned, the film was one of the sleepers of the year.<br /><br />John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is an exorcist.  His death from lung cancer is getting closer and closer to his soul and John's guaranteed a "Go to Hell and Do not Pass Go" card when he dies because he attempted suicide when he was very young--and actually died for a short time.<br /><br />Angela (Rachel Weisz) is a cop who can pick a serial killer out of a crowd and shoot them.  She sees things, though she denies it. When her twin sister died of suicide in a mental hospital, She believes some other evil forces were at play because her sister would never have done something like that.<br /><br />Angela learns about Constantine from a priest and goes seeking him for help.  Though a cop, she doesn't know about the daily struggle Constantine goes through to keep the balance between Good-and-Evil and the infestation of half-demons in the world.<br /><br />Demon activity is increasing in LA and it's harder to kick those bad boys back to Hell.  Turns out, a homeless man named Francisco has discovered the Spear of Destiny in a remote Mexican church and is under the Devil's instructions to bring the spear to LA.  If Francisco makes it, Hell's going to win the balance.  As he gets closer to LA, things get even more dangerous.  Constantine and Angela have to team up to fight the forces of evil.<br /><br />This is one rare instance where I liked the book, the movie, and the DVD.  I am going to check out the original works this film came from--because if I enjoyed the pale copy, I think I will seriously love the original.</p></body></html>

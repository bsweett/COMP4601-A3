<meta name="summary" content="An enthralling story of mystery and wicked truth"></head><body><p>"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" is a captivating drama thriller film centered on solving the Vanger Family secrets.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist and magazine co-owner who is disgraced by a dubious unfavourable court ruling, but despite negative headlines he is hired by Henrik Vanger, after a process of meticulous due diligence, to try and solve the disappearance of Henrik's niece Harriet whilst masquerading as writing Vanger memoirs.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is presented as a highly troubled young adult, but is actually a talented investigator with special computer hacking and research skills. Her demeanour is icy cold and at times vicious, yet this is simply a shield of protection from the abuse she has suffered. At first Blomkvist learns of her as a faceless person who hacked into his life at the request of Henrik Vanger's security advisor, yet Salander and Blomkvist come together as research partners. The mystery of Harriet becomes their project and they uncover the shocking truth at the risk of their own safety.<br /><br />Rooney Mara gives an explosive performance as Lisbeth Salander, and Daniel Craig is warm yet quite steely as Mikael Blomkvist. The entire cast present unique and convincing characters.<br /><br />The film is at times graphic and contains themes which may dislodge some viewers from their seat, with a sensational narrative that engages the viewer in a search for the truth.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

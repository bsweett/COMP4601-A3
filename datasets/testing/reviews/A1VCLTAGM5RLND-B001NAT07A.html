<meta name="summary" content="I don't if hally Berry was in this movie it was still bad"></head><body><p>How could a movie that features Halle Berry in a skimmpy, tight leather outfit be watchable. Well cause it's Hally Berry and she's hot but that's not enough to make this movie be worth anything. She doesn't even become Catwoman until about 1/2 hour in the movie. This movie is slow too. Not worth renting, watching at the bigscreen, watching it on HBO cable, or downloading on DVD burner. Sharon Stone has become un-attractive especially in this movie.</p></body></html>

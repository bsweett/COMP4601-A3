<meta name="summary" content="Still A Timely Movie"></head><body><p>Although the Cold War is over and George Bush may be best friends with Putin, this scary movie is as timely and valid today as in 1962 when it was released. Some things never change. Ruthless political ambition was alive in Caesar's time; of course Shakespeare's MACBETH speaks to it. Here shortly after the awful McCarthy era, John Frankenheimer directs this great suspenseful political satire. In this movie politicans who disagreed with Senator Iselin were called Communists. Today if you disagree with the political party now in the White House, you are soft on terrorism or don't believe in family values, just to name two. (The list goes on.) One only has to look at the negative TV ads and keep tabs on how much money both political parties raise in this country every four years to be reminded of just how timely this movie is. And directors, God bless them, continue to make movies that resemble-- and sometimes practically mirror-- the actions of those in power. The recent PRIMARY COLORS and WAG THE DOG come to mind.<br /><br />There is no bad acting here although Angela Lansbury is the best of the best and perfect as the ruthless driving force behind her senator husband. (How could she possibly have received co-star billing when she is in the movie much more than Janet Leigh?) We sometimes forget that Sinatra was also a fine actor as well as a great singer although he is wooden in a scene and a bit too much like Joe Friday. The dream sequences are outstanding as are the scenes from the convention. For those who haven't seen the movie yet, the ending is as good as it gets.<br /><br />THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE-- even the name is perfect-- is a great movie to watch on the eve of the political conventions of 2004.</p></body></html>

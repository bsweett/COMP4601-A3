Other reviewers have blabbed away the magnificent plot, and everyone knows how wonderfully Michael Clark Duncan played JC. The entire ensemble cast was excellent, without exception. Tom Hanks is powerful in the lead, and strong performances from Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Harry Dean Stanton, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey de Munn, and David Morse are all, individually, brilliant, and added to ensemble brilliance. Special mention must go to Doug Hutchinson's performance as the wimp. He was a nastier person than any of the guys on Death Row; that rotten little bully we've all known at one time or another, because he had "connections".It was, I thought, a courageous performance. Most unappreciated are the women; Bonnie Hunt is the ultimate devoted wife, and Patricia Clarkson will totally blow you away with her display of simplicity, insanity and renewal. At 3 hours, "The Green Mile" never fails to keep your attention. I love it.  UPDATE: I just bought the 2-disc version, and it' not that much better. The film is split between the 2 discs and it was annoying to have to change discs. The extras are pretty much the same, with maybe a few added ones. The price was right.</p></body></html>

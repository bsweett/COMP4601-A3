<meta name="summary" content="Men of Iron, Women of Steel -- The Tony Stark Story!"></head><body><p>[THIS IS BEING WRITTEN AT THE TIME OF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE -- AS OF THIS WRITING, THE DVD IS NOT OUT YET, THANKS.]<br /><br />Unlike other superhero films, with shoot 'em up action, crazed villains and a conflicted hero who is put into life threatening situations for himself and those he loves, director Favreau decided on a different take.<br /><br />Favreau went on an Iron-Deficient diet!  And instead created a story about Tony the man.  Tony the billionaire, arrogant playboy.  Tony, the man who is dying.<br /><br />The Paramount logo barely glows on the big screen when we hear the audio of the Senate hearings by a smarmy senator who demands the Iron suit "weapon" for the USA.  Tony wants it for himself and congratulates himself on "privatizing World Peace" *kiss kiss*<br /><br />However, the metal he is using for the energy core that is keeping him alive as well as powering the Iron suit is killing him.  CGI veins darken his neck.  But in a fit of wanting to protect those he loves by pushing them away, he gives away his art gallery, gives his CEO post to Pepper Potts and decides to party his life away.<br /><br />The world however ,was not meant to give Stark a relaxing good time.<br /><br />The other side of the world has a Russian physicist whose father worked for and later apparently discarded by Tony's father.  This man, Ivan, wants revenge.  Collaborating with a government stooge (Justin Hammer, a real idiot) he invents Iron-man clones which as we will later see will be used to bring down Stark Industries (known colloquially as "Hammer-oids").  Hey, I could NOT make this stuff up, OK??<br /><br />I disagree with critics who feel it's another Spider-man 3 [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPFH">Spider-Man 3 (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>] with a bunch of villains and mixing it up.  Far from it.<br /><br />The "women of steel" include Black Widow, working under cover for SHIELD as Tony's legal adviser (and man she is fine) and a great martial artist.  Love the fight scenes!  The other "woman of steel" is Pepper Potts, who is at her wits end about what to do about and with Tony.  She loves him but she can't stand him.  Whadda predicaminckt!<br /><br />The real player is Tony's dad.  We watch a film that would have done Disney proud as the "Key to the Future" is revealed (complete with Disney-esque music and style) but is actually more than it seems -- and gives Tony a key to his future.<br /><br />The relationship angle was a welcome change for the superhero film.  It's mostly story and plot and interaction between characters.  Yes, there are explosions and broken glass and flying bullets and guns -- but these are secondary -- even the villain is secondary -- to the man and the myth that is Stark.<br /><br />I was impressed!<br /><br />Minus one star for the slow pace.  I found that it went on a little too long, with Tony getting drunk, smashing up his own birthday party and so on.  The Shield connection and Black Widow's part could have been expanded in lieu of the silly party antics.<br /><br />Don't forget to stay to the end of the credits!  There's a cool chestnut for you Marvel Comics fans!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Character driven, real story and substance into the man that is Tony Stark, as he finds his body betraying him, as he is slowly dying and does not have a lot of options.  People who don't normally go in for these types of comic book-based films will enjoy this picture as a result of this new, original style by Favreau.<br /><br />Recommended:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00194IFQ2">Iron Man Viva Las Vegas # 1 (of 4) comic</a></p></body></html>

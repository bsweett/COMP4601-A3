<meta name="summary" content=""MY NAME IS FRANKENSTEIN!!""></head><body><p>I get a mental block about 10 seconds, so these reviews can be very hard to write, sometimes. Here is Mel Brooks' silly remake of just about every Frankenstein movie that's like....ever been made. Gene Wilder is a scientist named Fredrick Frankenstein who experients a corpse to try and reanimate dead tissue that he read from a book in the castle he lives in with Igor. Soon, he is successful......and I don't know what else to say. This HAS to be a classic. I think it is.</p></body></html>

Alexander Payne goes to great lengths to make Matt feel ordinary, confronted with his wife's untimely accident and the sale of the estate.  Clooney plays his character like a less dashing Miles from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026IYLQS">Intolerable Cruelty</a>, trading in his Armani suits for Hawaiian shirts and flip flops.  The music carries you through the film, with some great pieces by Ray Kane and Gabby Pahinui and other <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O2ANY6">Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar Masters</a><br /><br />Shailene Woodley steals the show, as Matt's plucky teenage daughter who helps him sort through his failings and try to repair what's left of the family, as her mother is kept alive on a respirator.  Her boyfriend Sid provides a handful of comic moments, but otherwise seems rather useless.  Amara Miller as young Scottie King appears at first to be a major part of the story, but is all too quickly pushed to the sidelines in favor of her big sister.  From this nuclear family we meet the extended King family, which once ruled Hawaii in colonial times, Kauai anyway.<br /><br />It is more or less based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812982959">book</a> by Kaui Hart Hemmings.  I think she wrote it more as a comedy than a melodrama, which unfortunately is the way Payne presents it, hoping to mine more of the emotional vein in the book,  but ultimately the story rings hollow the way he presents it on screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not one of the better superhero movies I've seen."></head><body><p>However, still watchable. I'm gonna make this kinda short and say that the main problem I had with this movie was that there was a lot of talking and explaining stuff (lots of these superhero movies are so serious at times lately!) and NOT ENOUGH ACTION. Where was it? Sure there is a pretty girl at Captain America's side and for anyone who cares, Captain America is played by the hottie Chris Evans who is seen shirtless a few times so there's that part of it. But to me there just wasn't enough fighting and fast-paced things going on in this mostly slower-moving movie. The action that did take place was fine and the scene where he is trying to escape a place that will soon explode with a friend was very gripping and kept my attention, but honestly there wasn't that much to work with here. I don't wanna step on any toes here when I say this, but I'd take any of the first 3 Spiderman movies over this one (oversensitive Pete and all). I liked those movies anyway.<br /><br />3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

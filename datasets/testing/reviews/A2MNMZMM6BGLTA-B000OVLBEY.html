<meta name="summary" content="Nicholas Cage = Ham Rider"></head><body><p>Nicholas Cage is a bad actor. This movie isn't even a real testemant to that cause it is a bad movie. Cage has reached a level in his movies that can only be surpassed by the hammy Burt Reynolds when his career was going down the tubes. Cage hams it up in every scene doing his quirk/Elvis/hambone gimmick that is so over used and over done by him that it is like, "why is he getting paid to do this?" and "why am I paying to see it?" I am a comics fan and I read Ghost Rider. Cage is totally miscast. But I guess when you have a ton of money and you are 'over' as a 'star' you get to play any part you want. Peter Fonda is good as Mephisto and Eva Mendes is hot but this movie just sucks. Cage is horrible and the movie is not half as fun or entertaining as it could have been if a good writer and director had taken the reigns and fired hambone droopy face. Sam Elliot is good... as usual.</p></body></html>

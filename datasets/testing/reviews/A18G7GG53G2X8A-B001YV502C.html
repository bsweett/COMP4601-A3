In the year 2027, governments have collapsed due to a major infertility problem. It seems that, for reasons no one is sure of, women are no longer capable of bearing children, and as a result, panic and fear has gripped the world. The story takes place in London, where a newly formed military government has control over everything. This is especially true when it comes to illegal immigrants, who are rounded up on a daily basis and sent to live in battle stricken refugee camps. Watching this film was a scary experience for me; what we have is a new version of an Orwellian civilization, where a failure to cooperate can lead to harsh penalties.<br /><br />The film begins with the news reporting the death of the world's youngest person (he was only eighteen). In an age where no new children are being born, such a loss is enough to make total strangers weep. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) is quite aware of their grief, yet he can say nothing about it. Many years ago, he was an activist who rejected the government's strict regulations. But ever since the death of his young son, he's lived a humdrum life, monotonously going to work everyday carrying a cup of coffee. Only when he's kidnapped at gunpoint does his life get interesting; he's taken to a secret location and reunited with his estranged ex-wife, Julian (Julianne Moore). Apparently, she's now part of a terrorist group that demands equality for all immigrants.<br /><br />She kidnapped Theo because she needs his help. Apparently, a girl from Fiji needs the proper papers in order to safely cross into a restricted area. He can use his influence on his cousin--a high-ranking British minister--to get these papers. He's initially reluctant to be a part of Julian's plans ... until he actually meets the Fijian girl. Her name is Kee (Claire-Hope Ashity), and she has a big secret: she's eight months pregnant.<br /><br />What follows is a dangerous journey through England, pitting the characters against seemingly insurmountable odds, including raids, deception, gunfire, and death. What makes the situation more difficult is that not everyone in this film as easy to trust as one might think; a number of characters have hidden agendas, not the least of which is preparation for The Uprising, which will supposedly pave the way to a new tomorrow by overthrowing the government. Those affiliated with The Uprising want Kee's baby for themselves, if not for a safe haven, then for a way to show the world that they are capable of starting a new society. It would seem that in this bleak future, money, land, and goods are not humanity's most valuable possession. Babies are. A baby means that there's hope for the future.<br /><br />In realizing the position Kee is in, and in understanding that danger is consistently surrounding her, Theo decides to help her himself. There are very few he can rely on for help; it seems that the only two trustworthy people are the holistic Miriam (Pam Ferris) and the philosophical stoner Jasper (Michael Caine). Soon word begins to spread about a secret development called The Human Project, which is a way to start a new society. This will be Kee's sanctuary as well as her baby's. It's only a matter of getting them both there before it's too late.<br /><br />Most of the narrative ideas in this film are not new; if anything, they're derivative of other futuristic Anti Establishment stories, such as "1984," "Escape from New York," "V for Vendetta," and "Mad Max." However, there's an underlying optimism that makes this story unique. Even when the bombs explode, the bullets fly, and the blood spills, I couldn't help but feel that Cuaron was working towards a more positive resolution, as if to say that hope is in fact a good thing to have. I even felt that way during a long shot, in which the camera follows Theo as he runs through the rubble of a refugee camp, trying to dodge the barrage of gunfire. A man is murdered in the midst of the fighting, and a few drops of blood hit the camera lens. It was a powerful reminder of humanity's weaknesses, especially since the scene doesn't cut to a new shot.<br /><br />Dr. Phil occasionally says that the past is gone and the future hasn't happened yet; the only time is now. Films like "Children of Men" could reinforce such a perspective, considering the future we're presented with is one to avoid at all costs. What good will come from thinking ahead towards a dark, cruel future? I think that's the point the film is trying to make, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. This is a fascinating film, filled with complex issues and difficult situations, all of which come together to form an appropriate ending.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Good Action Packed Science Fiction story.."></head><body><p>First off, the movie's plot is not new; more of a version of Bradbury's &quot;Farenhieght 451&quot; but I loved it. Christian Bale does a good job portraying a &quot;Cleric&quot;, an enforcer charged with rooting out people who still have outlawed emotions or materials deemed offensive (hmm, kind of like John Ashcroft, but Clerics blow up statues instead of cover their boobies). But the real attraction are the action scenes...WOW!! They are really good, real &quot;Matrix&quot; quality. The fight scene at the end blew me away, incredible!<p>Buy this film, an action film for the thinking man.</p></body></html>

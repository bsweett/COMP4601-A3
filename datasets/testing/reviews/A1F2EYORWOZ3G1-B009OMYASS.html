<meta name="summary" content="An exceptional sex-and-slice flick!"></head><body><p>Okay, so the sex-and-slice genre has been overworked. But some of the classics still stick out. Like Halloween, Friday the 13th and Scream (All the first in those series at least). So what makes this one stand out?<br /><br />It's the sum of the parts (no pun intended).<br /><br />Tarantino creates a slow developing sense of trouble and paranoia. It builds from earlier in the film than is suspected and continues til the climax.<br /><br />The plot has been gone over here in other reviews so I won't go into detail there. However, Tarantino has brought a polished product to the genre.<br /><br />What really sets this apart is that there is no supernatural elements and no psychotics weilding a knife. The 'Elite Hunting Club' is something that everyday people who can afford to buy their services belong to, just like belonging to a country club.<br /><br />The acting, sets, lighting and music all come together with a slick, fast moving story line that is at once believable.<br /><br />What is most frightening about this movie is that it could really be happening!<br /><br />Definitely not for the squemish! Typical buckets of blood splash across the screen. But, if you're up for a true roller coaster ride and being riveted to the screen and gripping your chair... I highly recommend this thriller. It is sure to become a classic!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exploitation, Revolution, Mayhem And Genocide ~ T I A (This Is Africa)"></head><body><p>Against the turbulent backdrop of political, economic and social upheaval in Africa Leonardo DiCaprio plays the part of Danny Archer, a white, native from Zimbabwe and former soldier-of-fortune turned diamond smuggler. He is a man with no wife, no children and since the murder of his parents, no country. Now in search of a fabulous diamond that rumor says was buried in the jungle by enforced laborer Solomon Vandy (Djimon Housou), Danny promises that he will help Solomon find his missing family if he shows him where the diamond is located. Solomon agrees and the dangerous journey begins.<br /><br />`Blood Diamond' released in '06 is a taut, well executed action/adventure, drama starring two of the best actors in the business today, Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housnsou. Add to the mix the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen and you have an enjoyable evening of viewing ahead.<br /><br />My rating: 4 ? Stars.</p></body></html>

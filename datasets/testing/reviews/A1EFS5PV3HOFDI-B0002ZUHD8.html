<meta name="summary" content="Complete representation of King Arthur gone awry"></head><body><p>Although I am no expert on King Arthur, all I have learned was from books such as the Cantebury Tales and such, I find it hard to believe the 'supposed facts' that this DVD is based on. First of all, King Arthur is apart of British history and we as American's should not be taking their legends, fables and myths as our own and distorting them so atrociously. The British don't take the Civil War or our great heros such as Washington as their own and make 'true' versions out of what happened.<br /><br />King Arthur, although having pretty cool landscapes is nothing more than a show of brutality and stupidity. The Roman's here are portrayed as being afraid of the Saxons when Rome at that time had one of the largest armies and was so bent on conquering the known world they didn't have time to be afraid. Face it, they wheren't even scared of Attila.<br /><br />While I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, there was just to much untrue representation going on that it was hard to truly enjoy it at its level. And whats up with Merlin? He's completely hard to believe as the infinitely filthy gang/rebel leader of some backwoods army. Would such a person ever recieve the name Merlin. Most likely not, its rather a noble name. Such as Guinevere (*sigh*) so much for daughter of a great king. Who did she belong to anyhow in the movie?<br /><br />On the whole, as one reviewer said, if they hadn't tried to use the names king Arthur, Guinevere, Merlin or Galahad it might have been more believable, and more enjoyable.<br /><br />How also did King Arthur get Excaliber? And if it wasn't such a magical sword given to him, then why was it so famous and named thus? Roman's didn't usually go around naming their swords for the heck of it. And what about the wall covering Britain from Italy? Who destroyed that so completely that it was never discovered until now? The Saxons? Angry at Arthur that they took it out on the wall? Please.<br /><br /> One the whole this movie tried to introduce a new idea, but falls completely flat. There are two many holes in this theory that just don't quite give it the necissary credience.</p></body></html>

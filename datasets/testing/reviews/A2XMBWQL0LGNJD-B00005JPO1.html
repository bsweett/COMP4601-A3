<meta name="summary" content="See Indy Nuke the Fridge!"></head><body><p>This is not an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />This is a FARCE of an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />I knew this movie was in trouble the moment the Paramount logo dissolved into a gopher mound and a CGI gopher popped up it was painfully clear that this film is a joke that doesn't take itself seriously, like a Mad magazine spoof on the big screen making fun of not just every Indiana Jones film before it but also every Lucas and Spielberg production from American Grafitti to Close Encounters, only Lucas and Spielberg were having fun making fun of themselves at the audiences' expense while laughing all the way to the bank. George Lucas once again stubbornly relies on silly digital cartoon characters of the Pixar kind instead of human performances and lazy digital effects instead of spectacular, good-old-fashioned in-camera stunts and falls into the same pitfalls that reduced his epic Star Wars franchise into a heaping mound of juvenile Saturday Morning kiddie fare.<br /><br />When Indy makes his silhouetted entrance donning his trademarked fedora, Harrison is so creaky in his delivery of cringe inducing dialogue with stilted lines like "I like Ike," and "Drop dead, comrade," you'd think he was a relic in his own museum. When Marion Ravenwood finally makes her welcomed entrance, I could almost hear the applause track from the studio audience as if there was an electronic cue card flashing just below the screen. Karen Allen spends the last half of the film staring doe-eyed at her hero Indy like a grade-school girl with a puppy-love crush that was completely out of character with her performance as the feisty tough-as-nails Marion from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Shia LaBeouf tries in vain to imitate Marlon Brando from The Wild One but instead comes off like Fonzie-lite. Every time he pulled out his comb I was waiting for the "Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!" John Hurt delivers an embarrassing performance looking like an acid-wasted Timothy Leary hippie stoned out of his mind and speaking in acerbic riddles pined from the pages of Dr. Seuss and the traitorous Judas, Mac, has no problem selling out his best friend and his country in the name of Capitalism but whenever he's in a bind has no qualms about turning to "Jooooooonneeessssyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!" for help and to which Indy willingly obliges him. The imitable Cate Blanchett chews every scene she's in with her villainous Russian dialect but takes it so far over-the-top that you'd think she was an evil-doer from a Saturday morning cartoon, specifically of the Boris and Natasha kind.<br /><br />To say that the characters were never in any kind of peril or jeopardy is an understatement. All of the action is so ridiculously contrived and exceed the threshold of suspension of disbelief into a new level of cinematic absurdity that makes the gags in Last Crusade and Temple of Doom look like Schindler's List. If you thought parachuting out of a plane on a rubber raft was implausible in Temple of Doom (and successfully busted by Mythbusters), that's nothing compared to going over three of the biggest (CGI exaggerated) waterfalls in the Amazon that make Niagara Falls look like a waterslide at Water World. Or how about Mutt Williams swinging from vines like Tarzan while being chased by digital monkeys?  Dovenchenko is not just Pat Roach-lite but the fight scenes between him and Indy are so tediously dull and predictable without any of the brilliant improvisational choreography that made the fight scenes so spectacular to watch in the first two films. Spielberg relies so much on his own cliches and once brilliant movie-magic and storytelling that he phones it in here asking us to fall for the old Close Encounters/E.T. schtick that I was waiting for Indy to pull out the Reese's Pieces from his bag and Mulder and Scully to show up.<br /><br />I'd just like to know where the real Indy 4 is hidden. Probably in a magnetic crate somewhere inside of Hangar 51 because what I saw on the big screen wasn't it. In fact, I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to step out from behind the screen and tell everybody they just got punk'd.  Kingdom of the Crystal (Bored Outta My) Skull is so drivelously dull that it plays like a TV reunion movie where all of the aging cast members come back for one last big brouhaha to celebrate their lifetime achievement cumuppance. I wish that this film had never been made and relegate it to the same toxic landfill of pointless sequels that should never have been made as Batman and Robin, Highlander II, Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions and Phantom Menace.<br /><br />There is something very poignant during the scene when Indy rolls out of the lead-lined fridge, comes face-to-face with a digital gopher, and stares up at the giant atomic mushroom cloud hanging over him emblematic of watching his franchise going up in a cloud of radioactive dust but I doubt that will stop dogged old George Lucas from running it into the ground further and milking it dry with Indy 5. For Harrison's sake (and ours) it's time for Indiana Jones to hang up the hat.</p></body></html>

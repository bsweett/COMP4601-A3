<meta name="summary" content="Who IS that on the dvd box art?"></head><body><p>I can't stop laughing at the artwork for the dvd case. Paul Giamatti is a terrific actor, there is NO arguing that. But did the marketing team have so little faith in the ability of this film to move off of shelves without having to virtually, completely alter his visage so as not to scare people away? While all four actors clearly benefit from the work of a skilled airbrush artist, I am in disbelief at how "pretty" Giamatti is made to look on it...so alien, so not him. THAT aside, this is yet another fine film by Alexander Payne, who's now 4 for 4. Great director.</p></body></html>

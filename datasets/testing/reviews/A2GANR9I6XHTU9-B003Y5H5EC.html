<meta name="summary" content="Intelligent Disturbing Thriller"></head><body><p>Hard Candy is what I would call the perfect 'internet' themed suspense movie. The story revolves around Hayley, An intelligent pretty 14 yr old girl who likes to spend most of her time online. One day while surfing the internet, She ends up chatting with Jeff- a man who happens to be 17 years older than she is. After a couple of weeks of chat sessions & flirting they end up deciding to meet at a local coffee shop.<br /><br /> While at the coffee shop they start having discussions. They seem to have an instant bond and relate well with eachother but under the surface there is a subtle uneasiness about it all. We can't really tell what Jeff's motives are and It feels like you're being tricked along with Hayley. Tricked because on first impression this guy seems to have only good intentions. He's handsome, well educated, responsible and seems to have her best interest at heart yet below the surface we think we know what he wants at the same time.<br /><br />After talking awhile, Jeff ends up inviting Hayley to his home with the promise of giving her an MP3 of a concert she's been wanting to see. She ends up going with him but what Jeff dosen't know is Hayley already knows what he wants, has a plan and by the time they get to his house this movie does a 180 on the viewer. After that it turns into a nonstop battle of terror.... A fight till the end between victim and captor ensues filled with interesting twists and suprises.<br /><br />You won't think of the internet the same way again...Also you'll question if some people on the internet arent what they appear to be and what motives they may have. This was a very uncomfortable movie to watch but as far as psychological drama's/thrillers go it was excellent. It's a modern, dark and intelligent thriller that won't disapoint.</p></body></html>

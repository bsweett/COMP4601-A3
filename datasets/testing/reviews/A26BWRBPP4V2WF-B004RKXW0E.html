<meta name="summary" content="Another excellent film in the franchise, but hopefully the last one"></head><body><p>To wish that a movie is the last in the franchise sounds somewhat negative.  However, the story arc and resolution of Toy Story 3 is so poignant and effective that it can't be followed by a new story.  In short, the plot centres around a college-bound Andy who has outgrown his toys - Woody, Buzz, Rex, Ham, etc.  In a series of misunderstandings, they all end up at a daycare centre.  This is all pretty lightweight stuff so far, and not very interesting.  When they get to the daycare, however, the plot thickens as they discover it is run by a big Strawberry-scented bear named Lotso who runs the place like a banana-republic dictatorship.  Andy's toys are banished to the room with the youngest children who proceed to misuse them dreadfully (e.g. using Jesse's hair as a paintbrush).<br /><br />Many people have compared the film to the Great Escape, and indeed the best part of the movie involves the elaborate plan to break out of Sunnyside Daycare.  It also borrows somewhat from Bridge on the River Kwai, with Buzz collaborating (after being factory-reset) with Lotso's crew, and Woody, having escaped, returning to help his friends' cause.  This is the point where the screenwriters show their cleverness - Pixar films always work best when the stories don't simply set a human story being played by toys (or animals or cars) but where the solutions grow organically from the properties of the toys themselves.  Hence, Mr. Potato Head uses the fact that his parts still work when detached from the potato to great effect.  Barbie uses Ken's metrosexuality as a weapon against him to extract vital information from him.  And when Buzz is re-reset and ends up in Spanish mode.... well, that is sheer brilliance.  Their Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Story is well-earned.<br /><br />This is clearly the most emotionally loaded Toy Story, and is very intense at the end.  Certainly, my 5-year old was okay watching it, but my 3-year old was scared and refuses to watch the end parts.  That gives you an indication of the level of intensity if you plan to but this for younger children.  I don't think it's giving anything away to say there is a happy ending, but perhaps not the one you'd expect (yes, Andy goes to college and the toys do not accompany him).  Luckily, the end credits provide a very important (and funny) wrapup to let you end on a smile.  (In fact, I can't think of a more effective use of a song at the end of a film, except possibly "Always Look On the Bright Side of Life" at the end of Monty Python's Life of Brian.)<br /><br />Ultimately, this film may endear itself to me as my favourite Toy Story.  I'm not ready to make that decision yet (having only watched it 4 or 5 times), but it's certainly the equal of the first two films in the franchise.  I bought the DVD version (because Disney Blu-rays drive me nuts!), and there are some neat extras, certainly enough for me without an entire 2nd disc of extras like in the 3-disc Blu-ray set.</p></body></html>

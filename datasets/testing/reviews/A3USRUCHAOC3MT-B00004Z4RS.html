<meta name="summary" content="An Adventure Movie For The Intellectual"></head><body><p>I saw a picture on a TV guide (I believe) in 2000, with a picture of a man with three blades coming out of his hand.  At first, I thought it was an ad for the newest Nightmare On Elm Street installment, until I noticed that it was Hugh Jackman in the upcoming movie "The X-Men".  My mind gave the famous line of Emily Litella:  "Well, that makes it completely different.  Never mind."  After all, I had read and loved the X-Men comics when I was younger, and knew enough to know that Jackman was playing the Wolverine.<br /><br />This movie was as good as I could imagine it, and even better.  It had the special effects and action you would expect in a comic book adaptation.  But the movie appealed to the mind as much as to the eyes and nerves.<br /><br />This movie (and actually, the whole series) deals with the issue of prejudice and how to deal with it.  In these movies, it is mutants that are the victims of this prejudice.  The story line says it is a spurt of evolution; there is nothing to scientifically verify this.  Nevertheless, the mutants are feared and persecuted.<br /><br />There are mutant protagonists, led by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and mutant antagonists, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen).  The difference between them is the response to the persecution.  The protagonists seek to live quietly and peaceably with humans, having Xavier's school as a place for protection and refuge.  The antagonists are ready to wage war with the persecutors.<br /><br />In this first installment, Magneto's goal is to transform humans into mutants, which he does to a Senator who wants to have mutants registered (not unlike the Jews in Nazi Germany, a comparison made in the first scene of the movie).  The problem is that humans are unable to withstand the change and end up dying.<br /><br />I avoid detailed plot descriptions in my reviews so I spoil as few surprises as possible.  I will say, though, that Magneto survives the first movie, not unlike Darth Vader surviving in the Star Wars movies.  One thing I like about the movie, though, is that Magneto is not the type of villain you want to see killed.  Magneto and Xavier are not true enemies, but adversaries who would admit the other is really a friend.  I am the type of person who would rather see a villain reformed than executed.<br /><br />This movie is PG-13.  The Senator's death, among other scenes, keep this from being a family movie.  However, I have no problem with teenagers seeing this movie.</p></body></html>

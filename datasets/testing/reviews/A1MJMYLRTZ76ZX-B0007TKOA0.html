(In other words, my sort of movie :-). It helps to have a somewhat skewed sense of humor and slant on life to enjoy this film, but if you like movies from directors like John Waters, Peter Greenaway, or Australian director Shirley Barrett (especially Love Serenade), you probably won't be put off by that, not to mention some of the more graphic language and occasional nudity and sex scene.<br /><br />Most of the movie isn't like that, though, and much of it is spent discussing the fine points of wine appreciation, hardly a subject for physical or low-brow humor which the movie has its share of. The subject of wine becomes a metaphor for several of the other themes in the movie, including unpredictability of relationships and life in general, and even the misadventures that befall the two main characters' during their week-long R & R, which seems destined to be an unmitigated but hilarious disaster from the very start.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed about it, which is more of a personal nostalgia thing, is that I've visited many of the places in the movie, including Buelton, Solvang, Sanford Winery, The Hitching Post Steakhouse, and others, and it was fun to watch the film and recognize so many of them from my past travels. I'm no wine connoisseur but I've read a book or two on the subject and so was able to follow most of the dialog about wine. :-)<br /><br />Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church as the pair of old college buddies were perfect in their roles and did a wonderful job of acting. I think they played off each other well enough so that I hope the director does a sequel or at least another film with both of them in the lead roles.<br /><br />Although not a film for everybody's taste I enjoyed its skewed and downbeat humor and slant on life and I look forward to seeing what this director does in the future.<br /><br />Also, if you haven't seen Love Serenade but enjoyed this movie, I can recommend that one also. Although not well known it has something of a cult following and until last year was the only movie the director had made in many years.</p></body></html>

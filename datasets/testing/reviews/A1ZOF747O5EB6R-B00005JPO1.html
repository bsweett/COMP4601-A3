<meta name="summary" content="Mr Spielberg, Let it Rest! Enough is Enough!"></head><body><p>It is sometimes the case with films that sequels fail to match up to their predecessors.  "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is one of those times.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's latest incarnation of Indian Jones sees the story largely unchanged.  That is, Indy is still an archeologist whose life is more frenetic that the average university professor.  He is still fighting baddies.  He is still getting into scrapes but always comes through remarkably unharmed.  Never a broken bone in sight!  In the "Crystal Skull", the only change of significance is that a decade of time has passed and the bad guys are no longer Nazis but Russians.  This is after all, the peak of the cold war.<br /><br />Harrison Ford does an admirable job again as Indiana Jones but the show is stolen by Cate Blanchett who plays an evil Russian intent on bringing Indy undone.  Without Ms Blanchett, I'm not sure where this film would have ended up.<br /><br />My advice to Steven Spielberg is to put Indy out to pasture.  The brand is being tarnished.  Let's call a halt to the process so that we can fondly remember the films and not have the earlier works denigrated by these attempts to wring very last dollar out of the concept.</p></body></html>

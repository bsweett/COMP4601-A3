<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's best B&W film"></head><body><p>Few horror films can stack up to this one -- it's a masterpiece of the genre.<br /><br />An attractive secretary pulls off a bit of embezzlement from her employer and heads for the hills. But not being a professional crook, her paranoia really begins to weigh on her (typical Hitchcock suspense) as she tries to skip town with the loot and, as she thinks she's being followed by a mysterious man.<br /><br />Ultimately she ends up out in the boondocks at the tiny and nearly defunct Bates Motel where she meets the soft-spoken proprietor, Norman Bates, who seems to befriend her and set her mind at ease a bit with his friendly manner.<br /><br />But, as this flashy little number takes her shower for the evening (really a vulnerable moment!), she gets to meet Norman's MOTHER (who lives in the creepy old 3-story behind the motel with her son, sort of), a French-knife weilding, nasty, hussy-hating stabber.... and she isn't going to tolerate her Norman's purity being soiled with the likes of an urban strumpett!<br /><br />I'll stop there to avoid "the spoiler" but, leave it to say, Hitchcock keeps us on the edge of our seats to the very end. This film is as good today as it was when it was released. Really creepy!!!</p></body></html>

James Spader stars as an Egyptologist who, along with Kurt Russell and his band of troops, are sent to the otherside of the known universe courtesy of an interdimensional transportation device called the Stargate.  Once there, they discover a culture much like that of ancient Egypt which is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson) who uses his boyish appearance to cover up his alien form.  When the film was released it was roasted by many a critic, but as the dynamic duo of Emmerich and Devlin later proved with Independence Day, it's the box office receipts that matter.  The special effects still hold up today, and the action scenes are rousing as well despite the hokey and lacking screenplay.  This seems like the umpteenth release of Stargate on DVD; first the Special Edition, now this Ultimate Edition; what's next the Super Extreme Edition?  Anyway, Artisan usually makes good and affordable DVD's (this one is no exception) but for God's sake, quit re-releasing and re-releasing just for the sake of more extras and different packaging.</p></body></html>

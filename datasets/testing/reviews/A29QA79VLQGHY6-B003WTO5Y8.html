<meta name="summary" content="Yummy!"></head><body><p>In a marketing no-brainer, MGM  Home Entertainment has dove-tailed a new version of the Oscar-winning &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; with the video debut of that suspense classic's controversial sequel, &quot;Hannibal.&quot; The release follows the Criterion and Image versions of 1998. It is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital but offers little punch in the rear sound mix. My disc required more of a volume push than most. The muted greens that saturate the film are adequately rendered and there are almost no signs of wear in the transfer. By far the better film of the two, it unfortunately comes with fewer extras and goodies than its sequel. Watching Anthony Hopkins' work in &quot;Lambs&quot; after viewing &quot;Hannibal&quot; only adds to appreciation of his decade-old performance. Hopkins was little known in the States when he took the role and, of course, it took him to stardom. Hopkins' original Lecter is a ghostly presence, lean and powerful, with cat-like movements that sell his sexuality and menace. Jodie Foster plays her Clarice as a young woman still exploring her world and the potential of her sexual powers. Tak Fujimoto's camera loves her, in shades of Hitchcock's female stars. In the DVD's accompanying new documentary, production designer Kristi Zea cites the art of Francis Bacon as an inspiration for much of the film's visuals. Other souces were photos of the Nuremberg trials and the fouled home of real-life serial killer Ed Gein. The &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; documentary tells of a surprising party atmosphere on the set, with none of the traditional supernatural intrusions that seem to befall most shoots of this type (according to their publicists). Most of the interviews are contemporary, although Foster's footage appears dated. Hopkins goes on at length about his thinking behind the Lecter character -- &quot;I knew that he was the shadowy figure inside all of us.&quot; Special features include some great clips of Hopkins trying out a series of masks for Hannibal, 20 minutes of (routine) deleted scenes, a making-of featurette from 1991 and an outtake reel. There is no director's commentary track. (I would recommend the widescreen version, BTW.)</p></body></html>

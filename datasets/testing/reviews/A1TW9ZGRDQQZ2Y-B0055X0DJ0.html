I know that's not saying much, but it had unique SFX that should have won the Oscar and a sense of fun throughout. Revenge of the Fallen has even better visuals and a whole lot more action, but the dialogue and script are really weak this time around. There are a bunch of scenes that try way too hard to be funny and the addition of two "black" sounding robots who claim they can't read, brings back horrible memories of Jar Jar Binks. Shia Labeouf is okay in the first half of the movie, but he is given little to do or say after that.<br /><br />There are a couple of things that left me no choice other than giving it three stars. The SFX are outstanding and you can see more of what is happening in the fights. Megan Fox is not even close to being a good actress, but she is really something to look at. Michael Bay loves showing her off, especially her gorgeous face. The other hot girl (Isabel Lucas) tries to seduce Shia's character in college and she is near perfect in the looks department as well.<br /><br />Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a long movie and it feels that way, but I was entertained enough to say it is worth seeing in theaters if you liked the first movie.</p></body></html>

He proved it with 1999's "The Mummy," which was a refreshingly light yet thrilling update of the old Mummy movie-monster.  "The Mummy" balanced outstanding special effects with some sparkling chemistry between the two leads, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, and employed the perfect comic timing of sidekick John Hannah and the definitely creepy presence of villain Arnold Vosloo.  Not a great flick, by any means, but a darn good one.<br /><br />"Van Helsing" is an attempt to regenerate exactly the same combination, just with a different script.  But instead of updating one classic movie monster, "Van Helsing" takes Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Jekyll, and even the influence of the "Alien" movies and throws them into the PG-13 blender.  But where "The Mummy" emerged from the creative oven as satisfying (and as nutritious) as a perfectly decadent Philly cheesesteak sandwich, "Ven Helsing" comes out like a stale Big Mac - overly processed lard without much flavor.<br /><br />It's a dratted surprise, too.  Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor, even in ridiculous movies, but here he is largely wasted in a non-sensical plot as the titular monster-hunter Van Helsing.  His back story, which is hinted at, is never explained . . . even during one of the script's many exposition-only speeches.  Kate Beckinsale is largely in the movie to look ravishing and bring in the audience from her vampire-wolfman "Underworld" movies.  As in most PG-13 movies, both Jackman and Beckinsale can be punched in the face hard enough to launch them clear across rooms, yet only emerge with an attractive trickle of blood on the cheek - sturdy stuff, these Hollywood stars!<br /><br />Perhaps that's the main problem with "Van Helsing" as opposed to "The Mummy" - it cheats on the violence.  Whereas in "The Mummy," the villain was updated with lots of magical powers that were thrilling and gruesome without being overly gory.  Dracula and the Wolfman, however, are in the ugly business of tearing out throats and rending limb from limb.  It's hard to do that correctly on-screen and still keep your PG-13 rating, which is essential for major box office.  So as a result, the villains in "Van Helsing" really come off as lightweights.  The less said about Richard Roxbrough's non-scary spin as Dracula - who comes off as snotty Euro-trash more than Evil Incarnate - the better.<br /><br />In addition to some pretty impressive special effects showing the brutal mountainscape of Transylvania, the movie's only other real charm is David Wenham's turn as Carl, the Vatican's gadget-guru and nebbishy sidekick to Van Helsing.  After seeing Wenham for the first time as the noble Faramir in Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies, it was hilarious to see him play the nerd with such brio.  His performance kept the movie's tongue planted firmly in its cheek, and he saves the movie to the extent it can be saved.<br /><br />Do not watch "Van Helsing" if you are looking for anything resembling thrills and chills or if you are putting together a retrospective of any of the participants' work, other than the artistic folks and Wenham.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie"></head><body><p>A sequel to the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons stands up well.  You do not need to see the previous film to enjoy this one.  A few passing references are made, but nothing important.  A good cast, and another good Catholic conspiracy keep this movie moving along at a fast clip.  I enjoyed the ending because it swerved several times when I was certain of one ending or another.  A fine thriller and not much Catholic bashing.</p></body></html>

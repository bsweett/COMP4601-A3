<meta name="summary" content="A delightful film, even to a non-Pixar fan"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />I'm really not a huge fan of animated movies, so let that speak for how much I enjoyed this wonderfully sweet film about a curmudgeonly old man and a lonely boy who end up going on adventures in the jungles of South America; never cloying or obvious, manipulative or hokey, this very funny and sweet film suffers a tiny bit in its slower and less moving middle passage but is nonetheless easily on my shortlist for the best films of 2009.<br /><br />3.5/4</p></body></html>

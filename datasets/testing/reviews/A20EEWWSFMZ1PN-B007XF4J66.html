<meta name="summary" content="Everyone is in love with Rick"></head><body><p>1942 the Nazi occupation of France. Refugees must take a long and torturers rout Through Casa Blanca on their way to America; there "Everybody comes to Rick's."  Rick's is a nightclub and a way station for a chance to get to America. Rick is played by Humphrey Bogart.<br /><br />Here we also stay for a while to watch a drama unfold. There are overlapping stories. One of a young couple trying to get to America and the girl wondering if a girl should have to do something naughty was wondering what would happen if her husband, "a boy in many ways", would find out? A second rate crook (Peter Lorre) obtains something of value at the expense of two German curriers. A Police Captain (Claude Rains) is shocked to find there is gambling going on at Rick's as he stuffs his pocket with his gambling earnings. Many other stories surround the main theme of a love triangle that started in Paris and now can mean so much to individuals or the effort for freedom.<br /><br />Will the Nazi's win their prize?<br />Will Capt. Renault get the young girl?<br />Will Rick get away with Ilsa?<br /><br />This film has become quite a classic. There are many quotes and misquotes attributed to the film. You will find your self kibitzing. One memorable seen for all is the showdown where the Germans are singing "Watch on the Rhine" and Yvonne (Madeleine LeBeau) over powers them leading the "La Marseillaise."<br /><br />http://home.foni.net/%7Ehahnstrohbach/diewacht.mp3<br /><br />Cannot tell if it is Blu-ray or just the big screen but many details are all of a sudden visible. It does not add to the story but is improves the viewing experience.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879513195">Casablanca: Script and Legend: The 50th Anniversary Edition</a></p></body></html>

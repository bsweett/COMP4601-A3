<meta name="summary" content="GREAT SPECIAL FX, DECENT STORY"></head><body><p>This was a cool movie, but the story lost my interest<br /><br />after a half hour. I still enjoyed it though. Will Smith<br /><br />did a good job in his leading role. I wouln't buy this<br /><br />movie, but I do want to see it again on cable, in HD!</p></body></html>

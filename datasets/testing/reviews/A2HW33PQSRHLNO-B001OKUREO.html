Just trust me.""></head><body><p>Oliver Stone's "W" had the most uncomfortable effect upon this viewer of generating actual pity for George Walker Bush, a man who has wreaked more destruction and sorrow on the planet than any President in the history of the United States.<br /><br />My basic attitude toward any Stone film is "big deal" without necessarily seeing the film.  I've never understood the OS phenomenon.  Particularly with respect to his "political" films, filled with disinformation so far reaching and absurd that one is tempted to call them propaganda.  (The film "The Doors" was absolutely awful and a complete waste of a great subject. It's "success" is a consequence of the naivete of the viewers and the "music video" strain in early 90's film.) "JFK" was entertaining in a horror/intrigue sort of way, but at no point was it remotely in contact with reality.  "NBK" was just futile depravity shot in really "cool" hues of studio light.<br /><br />This film, though, garners some real respect.  There is not one scene in this move that is sensationalistic or cannot be verified factually.  All one need do is crack open a respected bio(psy) of George W.'s reign of terror to corroborate information. "State of Denial" by Bob Woodward was obviously a big influence.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is an actress who has a talent for playing women in some scary/miserable situations.  One recent example is "Requiem For A Dream", playing a drug addled mother imbibing speed constantly to avoid acknowledging her son's rapidly escalating heroin addiction.  I maintain that I would rather be the mother of the demon possessed Regan MacNeil in William Friedkin's classic "The Exorcist" than the mother of George W. Bush or Bush Sr's wife.  As the woman who once told the press that there was no need for her to waste "as beautiful a mind as her own" on the messy business of body counts launched by her husband's insurrections, Burstyn does a fantastic job.  All steel.<br /><br />The madness of the Bush/Cheney administration is given a by turns comical, depressing, and sad treatment.  Josh Brolin looks nothing like Bush, but he acts *just* like him: the baseless self confident monkeylike confidence in his every word and physical movement, the innocent Texan swagger which would eventually shoulder it's way through the constitution and economy, and, of course, his complete lack of reading comprehension or intelligible communication skills.<br /><br />Brolin gives a devastating performance as a never truly grown man who makes every wrong decision possible, all in the interest of pleasing "Poppy", Bush Sr.  All he wants to do is please his father, also played brilliantly by James Cromwell. Since he has neither the talent, ambition, intelligence or political skills to do so (as his father gently indicates when Bush bullies his brother out of the Florida Governor's election) this becomes his one goal in life.  To be what he cannot be.<br /><br />When I'd originally heard that Richard Dreyfuss was playing Dick Cheney I laughed. Real loud.  The guy from "Jaws" affecting that chilling growl of a voice and hawklike blade of a gaze seemed absurd.  (A little like Tommy Lee Jones wearing a dead racoon on his head as Clay Shaw.) I was wrong.  He pulled it off, and then some.  Cheney casts a dark shadow over every meeting, using every opportunity to push this confused man child's aggressive impulse to "even score with Saddam" and thus outdo his father.<br /><br />And it works.  There's a bit of the "unholy trinity" here: Scott Glenn cuts down Jeffrey Wright's reasonable minded Colin Powell at every opportunity, Toby Jones is fantastic as Rove, the power minded minister of propaganda who teaches Bush the four food groups: and then Cheney, who swoops down every attempt at avoiding war like a starving bird of prey biting into his first newly born worm.<br /><br />This is a chronicle of failure seen through the eyes of the man held responsible for it as unemployment rises and we slide in to a recession unprecedented since the time of Roosevelt. Millions have died in a senseless war.<br /><br />The last shot is of a George W. Bush in a baseball field while it rains.  He is holding a a glove open, eager to catch the ball.  He doesn't.<br /><br />I felt terrible for Bush by the end of this movie.  Do I now, a few days later?  No.</p></body></html>

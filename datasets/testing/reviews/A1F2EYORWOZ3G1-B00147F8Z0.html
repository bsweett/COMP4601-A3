There's enough of these movies out there that it's becoming less and less terrifying, scary or whatever. What's happening is they are trying to recreate what the originals had. But you cannot do that and it will just ruin the legacy if it hasn't already.<br />The first AVP movie was pure schlock and not worth the film it was printed on. This one comes back closer to home base in a way that is much closer to the originals.<br />First, what I didn't like. It was too dark! Dark to the point where it was hard to make out what was going on at times. If you cannot see the action.... there is no thrill! Secondly, they are making the Predator out to be the good guy here. Even though he does some killing, his goal is to save Earth from the Alien and it's quite obvious. It doesn't fit with the story. The Predator came to earth in the first and second films to 'collect' human parts, specifically spinal columns and brains, as trophies. Let's not change him now to have a heart for that which he will ruthlessly kill.<br />What I did like was that the story on the Alien part made a lot of sense and kept to the original characters.<br />One thing I hope isn't going to happen.... this new hybrid they presented here... I hope it's the end of him in this movie... it just doesn't follow logically.<br />All in all, if you liked either of these characters this is worth watching. Not owning... but watching.</p></body></html>

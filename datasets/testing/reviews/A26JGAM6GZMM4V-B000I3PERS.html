<meta name="summary" content="An Enduring Epic"></head><body><p>There are five reasons why I rate this film so highly: great plot, great acting, outstanding production values, timeless themes, and indelible  images. As you probably know already, the movie focuses on William Wallace  who led the Scots to great victories before being betrayed, tortured, and  executed. Gibson combines his usual zest for physical activity with much of  the same sensitivity he revealed when portaying Hamlet. The supporting cast  members are all first-rate. Perhaps only Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan  are the film's equal in terms of production values. The battle scenes are  the most exciting I have as yet seen filmed. In sharp contrast, there are  lovely scenes of village life amidst the surrounding countryside. The  timeless themes include variations on David &amp; Goliath, the betrayal and  execution of Jesus Christ, and Odysseus' ordeals during his return to  Ithaca. There are so many vivid images it is difficlt to select a few as  examples. For me, details of the battle scenes and then the torturing of  Wallace are most memorable. Unlike so many other epics (eg El Cid, Quo  Vadis, and Cleopatra), Braveheart is one you will wish to see again and  again and again.</p></body></html>

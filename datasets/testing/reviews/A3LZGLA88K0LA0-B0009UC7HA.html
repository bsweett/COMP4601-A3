<meta name="summary" content="DIRK PITT STOP"></head><body><p>One can't deny the obvious affection for Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series.  The books have been phenomenal bestsellers, and it's odd that this is only the second to be filmed.  (One tends to forget the disastrous attempt at RAISE THE TITANIC back in the 70s).  Director Breck Eisner plays it safe in this adventurous and entertaining entry.  Matthew McConaughey makes a dashing Pitt, using his buff bod and charmingly boyish looks to make Pitt an accessible hero, far from the womanizer in the novels.  Steve Zahn is remarkably restrained as his sidekick, Al, one wishes Zahn was allowed to be a little more ostentatious in his role, though.  Penelope Cruz is nice to look at, but her doctor character could have been played equally as well by countless other actresses.  William H. Macy is underused in his role as the admiral, the commander in chief at NUMA who dishes out Pitt's assignments.  The sometime labyrinthine plot slows down the action at times and one wishes more focus would have been placed on the fascinating ironclad that mysteriously appears in the Sahara desert.  But SAHARA is reminiscent of early James Bond films and even though it didn't storm the box office, a franchise might be welcome.</p></body></html>

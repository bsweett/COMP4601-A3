<meta name="summary" content="Provocative But Flawed Cop Thriller!"></head><body><p>This movie is exhibit one supporting the old adage that actors often win a belated Oscar deserved for earlier work in a movie that scarcely qualifies for such an honor. While there is no mistaking the excellent performance of either Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke in this tale of a cop gone bad after spending too much time on the street, the mind reels to consider Washington performed as well as did Tom Wilkinson in "In The Bedroom" or Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind'. This movie is just not that much of a showcase for Denzel's considerable talents. <p>To begin with, the plot is hardly plausible, and it is downright silly to believe such patent nonsense as is presented here as the events transpiring in a single day.  Shades of James Bond! Whatever happened to the idea of presenting something believable? If we are talking "B" movie entertainment, fine. But if we are going to consider giving an actor an Oscar for an outstanding performance, it might be nice to have him deliver that role in something less than pop fantasy. Shades of old Rooster Cogburn in "True Grit"! As a fantasy escape vehicle, this gritty cop drama works well, but as a serious drama, it has holes big enough for Shallow Hal's girlfriend to waddle through. <p>All that said, it is an entertaining and action packed film. Indeed, this is a film overdosing on adrenaline, a movie with nothing but ups and precious few downers, except, of course, for the morality play at the end that serves, of course, to provide the filmgoer with a sense of closure and wrap the enigma of this bad cop up with a bow.  Yet a lot of bad guys get away with it, and this character certainly seems street-wise enough to have maneuvered his way out of the dilemma.  I enjoyed watching it, but felt the performances were not what I would expect from an Oscar-caliber effort at moviemaking. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

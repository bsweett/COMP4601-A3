<meta name="summary" content="Why this is fantasy and not real life..."></head><body><p>"Law Abiding Citizen" is full of surprises from the get-go. Director Gary Gray immediately shows the crime in the opening segment. There is no doubt about the killers or what they have done. The husband (played by handsome Gerard Butler) is the living eyewitness to the crime: his wife and daughter are viciously murdered during a house invasion. He is left to die.<br /><br />Then come the opening credits. Ten years later Jamie Foxx (the assistant district attorney) has made a deal for one murderer to turn on the other to get at least one lethal injection, although the actual murderer is the one who turns. Clyde Shelton (Butler) has patiently waited for justice--as he is a law-abiding citizen. Yet the Fox move to put his wins up to 96% riles the moral marrow of Shelton's bones. Where is justice? What kind of legal system do we have? The viewer knows there are deals, dismissals, too much protective rights for criminals and not enough for victims. Justice begins to show her vigilante face. The turncoat dies viciously.<br /><br />So far the movie is believable. Viewers can even identify with the methods of vigilantism. Right is right (even when it is wrong). When the line goes far beyond blur to a reverse perversion, I, a whopping big Butler fan, must cry foul.<br /><br />Then the viewer learns the nature of Butler's work (not to be revealed here). Things make sense now. Law abiding? From whose viewpoint? Can justice be validated under such circumstances? Does Foxx play fair when he makes deals. He justifies his actions--and reasonably well. Granted, he follows the letter of the law, but what about that moral marrow?<br /><br />The question slips from the nature of justice to address the two men: Who is right? Who is wrong? Can a line be drawn in this circumstance? Ultimately, "Law Abiding Citizen" addresses the serious flaws in our justice system. The method may be beyond the Pale and in the realm of fantasy (method not to be revealed here), but this vehicle of thought provokes! It is obvious why the two lead actors chose their roles--to be part of an ongoing discussion of the nature of justice and how it can be obtained in a flawed society run by flawed people.<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen. Even the title is provocative.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Death is the real thing that creates life"></head><body><p>Nostalgia is both a lifestyle and the future. It is a lifestyle because<br /><br />it keeps us going through any kind of adverse events, because we can<br /><br />only cope with the present if we have the past on our side and with us,<br /><br />because all our happiness is always somewhere in the past, this feeling<br /><br />of complete satisfaction that we had when we were so young and so<br /><br />little knowledgeable that we didn't know we were hungry, we didn't know<br /><br />the ice on the window panes proved it was cold in the room. We were<br /><br />fully satisfied with what we had and we had life, and we were living,<br /><br />and we were not afraid of death. We must remember there has not been<br /><br />one war on the American territory for more than a century. No one can<br /><br />have the memory of such a war. Home, sweet home, the little house on<br /><br />the prairie, the nostalgia of immensity controlled and absolutely not<br /><br />menacing at all. Nostalgia is the fuel of our present and of our desire<br /><br />to live. We want to live because there is something in our past that<br /><br />keeps us living. And yet we will go and we may be afraid of the future<br /><br />because we do not know that the future will stop when we have fulfilled<br /><br />our mission on earth and our mission on earth is to complete a life and<br /><br />a life on earth is to do a few things completely and leave behind us<br /><br />the recollection and remembrance of a person who has not left without<br /><br />finishing his job, without finishing his bowl of soup, without coming<br /><br />to the end of his assignment. But who assigns anything to us ? God you<br /><br />would say ? Why not ? Nostalgia, our past for sure, because we are<br /><br />transported in this life by forces that are far more important and<br /><br />powerful than what we may think of. And it is not an angel that may<br /><br />help the Axe-man, the executioner of bad missions, die in some kind of<br /><br />silly road accident that will not prevent the axe from falling on our<br /><br />neck and from pruning the dead limbs of the tree of life. The show must<br /><br />go on and thirty years is by far enough for us now to pass on, to move<br /><br />on, to go on living, or thinking, or dancing, or whatever, maybe<br /><br />singing, but with the recollection of what is no longer and the dream<br /><br />of what can maybe come to life nurtured in the hatchery of our memory.<br /><br />Robert Altman is thus improvising and variationizing on themes of his<br /><br />own career and his own coming death. It is sad in a way and comforting<br /><br />because he knew the road would not stop with his death. Better still,<br /><br />Robert Altman is philosophizing on the world. Yes, some bad men will<br /><br />come one day with a bulldozer and pull down what you have believed in<br /><br />all your life, and yet these dark and vast forces that make the world<br /><br />turn round will not mean death because they will make us think of the<br /><br />next stage and the next phase in our life that will have to follow the<br /><br />general movement and find its little spot where it will be able to<br /><br />excel again, because excel we can at all ages, even in death. We could<br /><br />even think Robert Altlan who knows a lot about lame-duck presidents is<br /><br />already envisaging what will happen in 2008. Change, a big change, and<br /><br />some angel will come to accompany those going out and clean the place<br /><br />for those coming in. And yet some old streetcar will stand stranded<br /><br />along the main highway, turned into some kind of diner for nostalgic<br /><br />people watching the world running by on the highway, and they may even<br /><br />have the view of a beautiful redbrick church at the end of the street<br /><br />with its lights and its warmth we feel radiating from it and this<br /><br />knowledge that no matter how bad it may become now, tomorrow will<br /><br />always be and probably be just as good as it has always been for us if<br /><br />we just try to be human. Don't forget that the elephant who watches a<br /><br />man in the nude will always declare : ? Not bad, but can you breathe<br /><br />through it ? ? That's the spirit man. There is always something<br /><br />everywhere that is not perfect but it is a question of point of view.<br /><br />So the wise elephant will not try to force the man to breathe through<br /><br />what it thinks is a trunk, and why not drink through it too. But as for<br /><br />passing water, no problem...

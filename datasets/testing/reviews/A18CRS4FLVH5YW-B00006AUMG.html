<meta name="summary" content="OFF THE HOOK!"></head><body><p>It is rare to see a movie that can it top its predecessor in both technical production design and an overall acceleration of movement throughout a would-be-let-down sequel.  Blade 2 is one of those rare movies that just has "something" that the first one didn't have-HEART!  I feel when I watch the original Blade (which I've seen too many times to mention) it seems as though the director wanted to simply introduce an idea-"the world isn't what you think it is."  Blade 2 has a strong (and complex) story, it's introduced it's important characters from the first one so it doesn't need to back track on things.  The exception is a few forced scenes I think they should've left out about Whisler and his history with Blade since most people already knew about that.  Aside from that, the reapers were simply a epic marvel of great prosthetics and slick CGI.  The action is faster, the gore is far more vivid and surreal and the overall look of the film is a showcase of constant improvements from the last film.  Quite simply, this DVD and film is OFF THE HOOK!  Can't wait for number 3!</p></body></html>

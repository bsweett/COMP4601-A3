<meta name="summary" content="Just an Outstanding Film!"></head><body><p>What a great movie! I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan but have enjoyed some of his films. This one, though, may end up as being my favorite of his. Filled with great scenes of both hope and tragedy, of sorrow and of joy, with just a touch of redemption thrown in.<br /><br />Based on a book by Stephen King, the Green Mile starts off in modern day times and then uses a "flashback" to tell the story of a group of death row guards during the depression and the strange story of a condemmed prisoner named John Coffy (played magnificiently by Michael Duncan). The story is a mix of drama, humor, and adds the spiritual/mystical as only Stephen King can do. The story also has one of the most creative twists at the end. Very surprising!<br /><br />But what takes this movie one of the best I've personally watched is the supporting cast. Besides the well known David Morse & Bonnie Hunt, we get James Cromwell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734850">L.A. Confidential</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127638">Star Trek - First Contact</a>), Michael Jeter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TANUI">Open Range</a>), Graham Greene (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F187">Dances with Wolves (Widescreen Edition)</a>), Sam Rockwell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A283AW">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Widescreen Edition)</a>) & Harry Dean Stanton (way too many great roles to pick just a couple).<br /><br />I would recommend this to any movie buff looking for originality and creativity. Great actors, great story, great film!</p></body></html>

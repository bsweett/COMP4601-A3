<meta name="summary" content="stupid, cheesy, but reasonably fun"></head><body><p>This is the kind of shlock SF/action thing that, regardless of reviews or how bad the ads look, I nearly always have a gut desire to see - and which all too often disappoints.  Having gone into this one 8 years after its release, having studiously avoided it and its sequels and knowing almost nothing about the plot or the game it was based on, I have to say that I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, at least at first.  No, it's not a great film or even a particularly good one, but in the hands of a director who is even remotely competent or interesting, this could have been a solid entry into the action/horror/sc-fi arena.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the director we have here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who has managed not only to have a fairly productive and lucrative career but also to marry the fabulous Milla Jovovich, his leading lady in this film and the sequels.  The only other PWSA film I've seen is ALIEN VS PREDATOR, and this is certainly a notch above that film, but it still shows plenty of examples of poor editing and narrative construction, dull and ugly action scenes - excepting a couple where Milla gets to kick butt on her own - and fairly obvious and trite horror movie clich&eacute;s in abundance.<br /><br />What's good about the film is mostly Milla, who I wouldn't say gives a terrific performance exactly, but who does exude a presence, show some nice physical grace and power, and communicate reasonably well the character of a woman just starting to come out of memory loss - and to realize just how much the mega-corporation that she and nearly everybody else works for has betrayed them all.  She is Alice, apparently a former security professional for the Umbrella Corporation, and she has seemingly lost her memory as a result of some kind of nerve gas.  She awakens in a fancy mansion that turns out to be a secret portal to the underground Hive, a supercomputer that runs nearby Raccoon City and is a breeding ground for all kinds of unorthodox experiments.  Alice has to accompany - and eventually lead - a team of commandos into the Hive to see what's gone wrong with it, and along the way they encounter those most boring (to me) of currently popular horror icons, zombies.  Somehow an anti-aging virus developed in the Hive has this unpleasant zombifying side-effect, and the Hive has killed off all of the scientiests within.  Except, of course, that you can't really kill a zombie.<br /><br />Like I said, there are some good action scenes with Milla, and there's also a nice sense of claustrophobia at times - it seems like the Hive might go on forever - but on the whole this wasn't any better than "OK" for me, and it sure wasn't helped by the dreadful bang-your-head-against-the-wall music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson.  I guess it's what the kids like.  But to be fair, this probably does feel a lot like the videogame - lots of action and blood, paper-thin story and virtually zero in the way of characterizations.  Well, being a hardcore fantasy and SF viewer, I've certainly seen plenty of worse stuff.</p></body></html>

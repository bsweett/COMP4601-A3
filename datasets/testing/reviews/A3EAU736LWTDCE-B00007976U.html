BUT! you keep waiting and waiting (like a suspense movie, maybe like silence of the lambs) for something dramatic or really sick to happen, because the character robin is playing is so unstable and mentally not there, you wait, and wait....and wait...and....NOTHING!! NOTHING EVER HAPPENS, a movie that manages to grab you from beginning to end, just to deliver NOTHING! without giving away too much, what would have made or breaked this movie would have been that final scene. If it had been blood beyond belief, then I would have rated it way better.....but nothing HAPPENS!!! anyway you get the point. Rent it first, bring a pillow.</p></body></html>

Cage plays a motorcycle stunt driver that finds he has the power to fight evil minions, even when they have super powers. This is very enjoyable but not quite the caliber of X-Men, Hellboy, or Fantastic Four. I think the reason is it doesn't have quite the story depth as the more popular ones. Notheless I certainly enjoyed Nicholas Cage, Raquel Alessi, and Sam Elliott in this newest comic to screen movie. More so than the Spiderman series which I think is partly since I personally think Tobey McGuire is to wimpy for the role. Cage plays Ghost Rider tough and it pays off. Everyone does a good job and the effects are excellent. Music rocks and so does the movie. I think this may appeal to guys slightly more than ladies, but Cage will at least get their eye. Unfortunately my wife didn't find it as entertaining as me. She liked him better in Con Air. Worst of all I notice that fans of this movie can't handle constructive criticism so they vote down anyone that doesn't agree with them that this is the best movie ever made.</p></body></html>

Kudos, Klaatu. Unfortunately, this film is just too much of a target for the naysayers with him portraying a demi-robot. It's almost as if he were asking for all the tired, hack journalists and haters to come back to life from whatever crypt they've crawled into since they were all laid off from their newspaper jobs, to give the knee-jerk reaction without giving the movie a full viewing and a fair shot.<br /><br />From some of the comments and reviews, I doubt a lot of people who gave this film a thumbs down even saw it from beginning to end. Having looked at several of the one-star reviews, I searched through the reviewer's cache to find the bulk of them gave 5 stars to Brendan Frasier's appalling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAOY5U">Journey to the Center of the Earth </a>. The gripe about that film was the overuse of CG, but some of the same reviewers that gave it a thumbs up, gave this a thumbs down for the same reason. What bombast.<br /><br />I found TDTESS, not a great film, but not bad either. The thematic elements and the overall story weren't  too overdone, nor was it too preachy. Matter of fact, they could've gone a bit further than they did. They used the CG GORT to intimate several things about our destruction through example rather than just telling the viewer outright, which is a step-up for filmmaking and an intelligent way to spin a yarn.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this film wasn't the CG or Keanu or the theme, but the overly-annoying acting by the child ward in the care of Jennifer Connelly. I felt that this thread in the story dragged this film into the sewer and beyond, wrecking an otherwise smart and well done premise. After the Nth subterfuge by the brat-in-tow, I was ready to give up on this as it was losing itself between a sci-fi version of Finding Forrester and something more intelligent like M. Knights <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016CP2O0">Signs</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I">Children of Men</a>. Man's destruction from his own foolishness.<br /><br />Keanu's Chinese wasn't bad either. My wife, who is Chinese, said his pronunciation and cadence were pretty good for a Westerner, but that a lot of people would say it wasn't `perfect', which is what many expect when speaking it. One of the better scenes in this is the surprise appearance of James Hong (Chew from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UD0ESA">Blade Runner</a>) and the conversation that they have in the diner, which really sums this movie up well. Keanu would be wise to partner himself up with more veteran actors like this as he shines in these moments.<br /><br />I watched this on Blu-Ray and found that while the picture was amazing and the muted tones were interesting, you may want to skip the Blu-Ray version as the heavy amount of CG does begin to show in the image processing on the screen and several times the obvious nature of the dreaded green-screen was obvious. `Less picture' definitely helps this movie.<br /><br />Also this would be considered a movie and not a film. I doubt this will ever show up in AFI's top 100 or on the IMDb top 250.<br /><br />This also has the older film attached on a separate disk and is interesting to see how political ideology has changed since the original first premiered.<br /><br />... ...</p></body></html>

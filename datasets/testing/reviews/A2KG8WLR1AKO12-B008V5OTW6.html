Steven Spielberg allowed his left wing ideology get in the way of the story.  He seemingly wanted to make sure that we left the theater believing that both sides are equally guilty in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  Radical leftist Tony Kushner, who believes that Israel should have never came into existence, wrote the screen play.  Both gentlemen obviously perceive the Palestinians as alleged victims of Israeli imperialism.  The murders which took place during the Olympic games in 1972 are therefore somewhat understandable.<br /><br />The very first thing you must remember about Munich is that it is not even remotely true.  Israel did indeed send assassins to kill the Palestinians responsible for the massacre---but they were not existentially guilt tripped.  None of those who actually participated in this pursuit of justified vengeance resemble the fictional Avner (Eric Bana) and his group of misfits.  We follow the latter throughout Europe and Beirut as they one by one assassinate those on the hit list provided by the Mossad.  There is one peculiar scene when the Israelis and a group of Palestinians spend the night together.  They do not sing Kumbaya.  Still, their interactions supposedly suggest that the world would be a wonderful place if only we learned to communicate better with each other.  Terrorists only need a little love and understanding.  Moreover,  employing violent methods to eradicate terrorism will make things far worse.  The cycle of violence must stop.  Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth.  Violence often accomplishes some wonderful things.  If nothing else, it's how we ended WW II.  Also, please note that regular police officers do not stop arresting criminals merely because crime does not totally disappear.  Is Munich a pacifist film?  No, it's far worse than that: it is an indulgence in nihilism.</p></body></html>

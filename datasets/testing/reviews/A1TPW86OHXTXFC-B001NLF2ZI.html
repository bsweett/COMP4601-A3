<meta name="summary" content="Vengeance Is A Lazy Form of Grief"></head><body><p>"Vengeance is a lazy form of grief", Silvia Broome tells Toban Kellor, the Secret Service man protecting her and at the same time questioning her innocence. This phrase, we come to learn is an African philosophy that Silvia proclaims to follow.<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat on the plane as I was watching "The Interpreter" on the Dig-E viewer I had rented from the airline. This is one of the few movies I have seen in the past two years that had me so entranced. In fact, it was the last movie I had seen with Sean Penn in the lead role, which had me this engrossed. Nicole Kidman, as Silvia Broome, a South African transplant to the UN, really stole this movie. Her portrayal of the Interpreter was solid, low key, likeable and brilliant. She was a real person, with emotional trauma, and her response to the conversation she overheard at the UN and its aftermath was real and poignant. Sean Penn, as Toban Kellor, the Secret Service agent whose job it was to protect her and to question her, was low key and right on.<br /><br />This movie takes on a political edge as World Peace and Terrorism is questioned and played out in real life. The opening scene of a traumatic nature is so vivid and unyielding that we understand this is a movie to be reckoned with.  Silvia Broome has a romantic job as an interpreter at the UN. She is good and she is professional. She is living her life of simplicity and as peacefully as she is able. We come to realize that this may be a scam but it is up to Toban Kellor, our hero to delve into the mysteries of this woman. Along the way, we come to learn more about Siliva, her deep, dark secrets. And, we also learn about Toban Kellor and his silent moodiness.  We meet Tobin while he is in a bar, and he unplugs a jukebox to insert his coins and play a song that has meaning to him. One of my all time favorite singers and songs is picked by Toban, and I am suddenly very alert.<br />The song Toban plays on the jukebox when he calls his answering machine is Lyle Lovett's "If I Had A Boat". "Lovett claims that this song is based on a true story. He once tried to ride a pony across a pond. Hopefully it was not a deep pond and the pony was never uncomfortable. As far as we know, Lovett is good with animals and children, and thought it would be easier if he had a boat."<br /><br />"If I had a boat<br />I'd go out on the ocean<br />And if I had a pony<br />I'd ride him on my boat<br />And we could all together<br />Go out on the ocean<br />Me upon my pony on my boat"<br /><br />The drama, action, suspense, mystery and reality of this movie had me hooked from the get go. A story of two people within a larger story of the quest for peace and the reality of terrorism. This is a movie to be enjoyed while on the edge of your seat. The acting is superb. The ending a little unsettling.  All in all, highly recommended. prisrob</p></body></html>

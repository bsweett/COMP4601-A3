<meta name="summary" content="At last!  The treatment it deserves"></head><body><p>this movie is a modern-day Christmas classic. It captures the joy and fear and exhilaration and disillusionment of what it was like growing up in an America of a by-gone era. The late Jean Shepherd is from my parents' generation, but I can still relate completely to Ralphie, Randy and all their friends -- bullies at school -- Not getting what you really want for Christmas -- having your mouth washed out with soap and fantasizing about the day when they'd all be sorry... It's all there!<br />Not everyone seems pleased with this SE, but I'm thrilled.  Compared with what was previously available on DVD, this is lightyears better!<p>The extras are great fun, especially the interviews.  It's a shame Jean Shepherd died before he could truly contribute to this real keeper.<p>As for the movie itself, Darren McGavin is great as the blustery but sentimental dad and Melinda Dillon as the mom who is wiser than her kids give her credit for. The movie is touching and hilarious at the same time. It's so hard being a kid sometimes!<p>This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and still laugh.  Everyone gets a chance to relive those classic childhood memories.</p></body></html>

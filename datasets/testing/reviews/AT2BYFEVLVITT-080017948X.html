<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite comedies!"></head><body><p>I thought Bill Murray was the perfect person to play this role, and I think its one of the funniest movies I have seen. The idea of having to live the same day over and over again is a great setting for Bill Murray's  talents to shine. I love all the situations he puts himself into, for  example the numerous suicide attempts and how he eventually learns anything  and everything about everyone in the entire town. If you haven't seen this  movie yet, definetly go check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="On a par with the original"></head><body><p>The original Final Destination was an interesting twist on the teen slasher flick:  instead of some standard masked killer picking off people one by one, it was Death itself doing the job, an invisible but definitely intelligent presence who is unbeatable because it cannot be directly battled.<p>As in the original movie, the sequel begins with a character having a premonition of a disaster and then avoiding it, saving her life and those of a few other people.  Death, however, will not be cheated, and starts picking off the reprieved.  Apparently, cause of death is important:  if you were meant to die in an accident, you will not die of natural causes.  Most of the movie is a series of killings and near-misses, with the cleverness coming in the way Death sets up the kills.  If Rube Goldberg had been a serial killer, the contraptions he developed would have fit right into this film.<p>Unlike the first movie, the characters are aware as to what is going on, having heard of the earlier story.  It doesn't really help; the only vague help they get points to cheating Death by having a new life that was unplanned for come into the world.  To me, the solution would be to have the male and female leads have a kid, but the film goes off in another direction.<p>For what is basically a slasher flick, the violence itself is rather tame.  The director seems to shy away from the gore, with the worst of the scenes almost flashing by.  Instead, the focus is on suspense...we know these people are going to die (except maybe the main characters), we just don't know how or when.  For fans of the first movie (which is the obvious audience of this film), this sequel should be an equally pleasing experience, and even if you have not seen the original, this one can be fun.  While not a classic, Final Destination 2 is clever and entertaining enough to rate four stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Amityville" Calamityville - Remake Is Horrorible"></head><body><p>"Is this torture?"<br /><br />"I thought it was meatloaf."<br /><br />"So, basically, the whole movie is horses**t."<br /><br />"Your words, not mine. But, I don't think there inappropriate."<br /><br />- The Lutz family tries to figure out whats for dinner in their haunted house on Ocean Avenue, while an interviewer prys the truth out of the real George Lutz on what he thinks of the remake to "The Amityville Horror"<br /><br />Bad remake to the sub-par 1979 original. The true horror here is the film being touted as based on a true story, & the truth being all but left out of the film (once again, MGM didn't consult with George Lutz & when Lutz tried to communicate with the studio he got slapped with a, still pending, lawsuit). With MGM hitting rock bottom financially (Sony Entertainment bought MGM out this past week) & the studios last big hit (the last Bond movie, Die Another Day) was over 2+ years ago its no wonder that MGM gave the go ahead to Michael Bay (of all people) to do a remake of one of its older films. The results, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just plain suck.<br /><br />In November of 1973, in Amityville, New York, the Defeo family was massacred by the families oldest son, Ronnie Jr. (its still the most heinous act ever committed in the village's history).<br /><br />One year later, George & Kathy Lutz, with Kathy's three kids & the family dog, Harry, move into 112 Ocean Avenue after buying it for a steal at roughly eighty thousand dollars. 28 days later the family flee their house in terror saying that the house is so very haunted and vowing never to return leaving their personal belongings behind.<br /><br />The above statements are true & are well documented (DeFeo is serving six life sentences for his crimes against his family). What isn't true is the events that take place throughout the remake of this film. The real problem is, if a film states that its based on a true story, then the film should definitely stick to the true source material that inspires it.<br /><br />Here is the truth according to George Lutz:<br /><br />- There were cold spots throughout the house, including the basement, kitchen, & sewing room. He did always feel a chill and was sick but never was he obsessed with chopping firewood, or carrying an axe around the house. According to George, he never chopped wood at all! He also didn't kill the family dog (thats just brutal).<br /><br />- The Jody entity wasn't a girl, or related to the DeFeo's, but was a pig-like demon that made "friends" with George's stepdaughter. In the A&E History's Mysteries episode on the house, George states that he saw two cloven-hoof like footprints next to his stepdaughters footprints outside in the snow throughout the backyard. At night, George & Kathy would spot a pair of glowing animal-like eyes peering in through the windows of the house, no matter what floor of the house they were on. One evening, George breaks down in anger & throws a chair at the eyes smashing the window it was peering into, with the entity letting out a high pitched piglike squeal & snorting off into the night. This part of the story still gives me the creeps.<br /><br />- Father Piccoro did bless the house. While blessing a small room on the second floor, Piccaro did feel something slap the back of his head, telling him in a whisper to get out of the house. He told the Lutz family as long as no one was to room up there, the room would be fine. Kathy says that the room was going to be turned into a sewing room.<br /><br />- On one of the worst nights, George awoke to find his wife slowly levitating out of bed, while on the floor above he could hear his stepkids scream and cry in terror as their beds were slammed up & down on the floor. Harry, the family dog, was pacing in fear and throwing up. George was helpless being mysteriously pinned to the bed, unable to help his family.<br /><br />There is a lot more. Kathy finding the red room in the basement, windows that would open on their own - no matter how hard you nail them shut, etc. Check out www.amityvillehorror.com, the website that George Lutz operates and discover what really happened during those 28 days with the Lutz family. Truth is creepier thatn fiction.<br /><br />As for the house, it still stands on Ocean Avenue (different number though, I think its 108). The colonial windows are long gone (the "eyes" of the house). The real horror is the house is now painted yellow. ewww.</p></body></html>

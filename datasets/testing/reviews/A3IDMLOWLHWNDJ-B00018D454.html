<meta name="summary" content=""Texas" Toasted"></head><body><p>unnecessary remake of Tobe Hooper's, gritty, documentry, style horror film. This "Texas Chainsaw" is a slicked up, glossed over slasher film that tries to scare, but, I couldn't help but watch and compare it to the original, as the film unspooled before me.  <p>Its the early 70's, in anywhere Texas, USA. On a deserted stretch of road, a van full of kids are headed to see a Sknyrd concert (& hopefully score some reefer on the way), but, get sidetracked when the group picks up a beaten, battered, exhausted, & bloody young girl, staggering on the side of the road, claiming that "he's coming" and she wants to end it all. She does by grabbing one of the kids' pistol and blowing her brains out. Everyone freaks and stops at the nearest store to call for help. The kids get deeper into to trouble, as the lady of the store tells them that the Sheriff will meet them all down the road, in a field not to far from the store. Sad to say, who & what they run into has nothing to do with Law Enforcement.<p>The film has some major problems. <p>One - I did not buy for one second that the film takes place in the 70's. The film is so glossed over that it looks like the film was made by the employees at the local GAP. Also, why is it that every filmmaker has got to have "Sweet Home Alabama" playing on the soundtrack to make a statement that the film is offically in the 70's? Alabama ain't that sweet.<p>Two - These kids are dumber than Gump! They deserve to die! I would have brought the girl's body to the local hospital, no if's, and's, or but's about it (if anyone rejected that idea, I would've tossed'em out of the van). Even if I stopped to call the cops, I wouldn't be going to no field in the middle of East Bum**ck, Texas, no matter what the cops say.<br /><br />Three - The "Blair Witch" documentary style pieces that bookend the film aren't neccessary and look foolish. It comes off like an episode of "In Search Of" without the search.<p>Four - Leatherface. He sucks. Gone is the crazy, running, cannibilistic, squealing, hill-billy mute from Tobe Hooper's nightmare. Here, Leatherface looks like he could easily get sidetracked playing charades rather than chasing young, nubile, females for his supper.<p>I can't stop recommending the original because with that film it had a gritty, dirty, sadistic, scary, 70's documentary feel to it (I still cringe when the kid in the wheelchair gets the chainsaw handshake from old rubberface). As for the remake, watch the original first, this "Chainsaw" runs with the chain off.</p></body></html>

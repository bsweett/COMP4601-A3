Guy Pearce is fantastic in this film, he is such an underrated actor, people often tell me I look like him, so it's weird to watch him in this role, because his character is so confused and lost, it really resonated.  It was so cool how he wrote things on his body so he would remember, you could feel his desperation, really a great performance.  I always suggest this film when people say that they can't find an original film.  If you appreciate great film making and enjoy a great performance then I can't imagine you not liking this film, it will stay with you.</p></body></html>

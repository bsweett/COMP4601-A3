<meta name="summary" content="The ending saved this movie"></head><body><p>I really question those who think this movie was well acted.  There were too many scenes when Ashton looked like he was seconds from bursting out laughing.  And what about that one scene when he performed that weird clown run down the hall?  It also felt a bit long.  Honestly there were too many painfully acted scenes, but I do give the screenwriter props for an interesting concept and I think the director's cut ending was bold and won another star from me.</p></body></html>

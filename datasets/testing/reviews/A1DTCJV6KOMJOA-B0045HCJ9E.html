The color pops thanks to the tranfer to dvd and the script is as beautifully written as Shakespeare! The film begins with a hilarious situation playing on Grant's under comedic timing and never stops or slows down. The injokes are plenty between Mason and Landau's characters less than subtle sexual interest in each other. You have to be really sharp to catch it but it's evident or Eva marie Saint's dubbing of &quot; I never have Sex on an empty stomach&quot; The Rushmore scene alone is worth the purchase if you are looking for a film that throws every element from one of the best film directors and creative geniuses of all time into one of the best action films. The plot takes more twists and turns then juice through a crazy straw. We go from hotel room, sex,  torture, to Grant running in a corn field being chased by a crop duster that comes through with such percision, that you think its gonna crash in your house! Hitchcock is simply amazing!</p></body></html>

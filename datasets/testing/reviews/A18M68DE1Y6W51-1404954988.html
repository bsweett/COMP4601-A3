<meta name="summary" content="Flawed, But Very Sweet"></head><body><p>I have read some fairly vicious reviews of this movie, and I don't understand why. It doesn't pretend to be more than it is; a rather gentle poke at the mores and values of a very liberal, trying-hard-to-be-humanitarian Southern California family.<br /><br />Other reviewers have described the plot: Spoiled brat wife Deborah (in a much-too-over-the-top hysterical performance by Tia Leoni) hires Latina housekeeper (the stunningly beautiful and intensely endearing Paz Vega), and tries to show her that she considers her equal to the family. There is much humor and some pathos, but the enjoyment is in the supporting actors. Vega is absolutely marvelous as the proud housekeeper who sees through her employers much more than they know; Sarah Steele, an endearingly awkward teenager, is fabulous as the daughter whose mother lets her know how fat she is. The acting falls down with Adam Sandler, the perfect husband and father who isn't believable for a single minute but who isn't obnoxious about it, and Leoni, who WAY overdoes the neurotic Deborah to the point of fingernails on the blackboard.<br /><br />So why did I like this movie? It is just basically a sweet story, no harm done, nothing horrible, and very enjoyable if you aren't looking for something deeply intellectual. I like it, and would recommend it despite its flaws.</p></body></html>

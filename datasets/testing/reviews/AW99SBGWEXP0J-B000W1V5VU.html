<meta name="summary" content="Ocean's Thirteen"></head><body><p>Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his gang are back, this time to get revenge against Willie Bank (Pacino). Bank has screwed over Reuben Tishkoff (Gould), and taken his land and money to build a new casino, causing Reuben to have a heart attack.  The gang, led by Ocean, Rusty Ryan (Pitt), and Linus Caldwell (Damon), decide to put the new casino deep into the red and steal Bank's diamonds.<br /><br />"Ocean's 13" is a vast improvement over "12" and on par with "11", if not a little better.  The cast know their characters so well by this point and have a great chemistry.  You know that they had fun making this movie, and it shows.  The action is minimum, but interest is sustained through following their plan as it comes to fruition.  There are some twists, but nothing earth-shattering.  Mostly, this is a chance to see good actors doing their thing.  Fans of this series will not be disappointed, and although director Steven Soderbergh says this is the last one, I can't help but hope that he changes his mind.</p></body></html>

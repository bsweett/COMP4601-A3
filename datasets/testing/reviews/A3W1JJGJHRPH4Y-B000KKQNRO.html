I still don't understand the Priory of Sion's motives in keeping the Grail secret. Destroy the secrets and you keep the grail safe. Why keep it secret? Why reveal it at the millenia? Why would Sophie be the one descendant to reveal it? Why is there only one descendant left? Shouldn't there be thousands of descendants after all these years? How would the 2000 year old corpse prove anything? So what if Sophie is a descendant of Mary M.? We don't have Christ's DNA. I'm willing to postulate there are descendants of Mary M. running around, but this doesn't prove Sophie is a descendant of Jesus. It means Mary M. had children. I mean, I know it is a work of fiction, but come on. Doesn't a few plot holes need to be filled?<br /><br />Questions aside, the acting was ok I guess. Hanks hair is fine. The scenery was ok. The movie seemed very long to me. The action sequences if you can call them action sequences were pretty bad. The camera turns away during most of the "action" sequences. Think about it. The historical flashbacks were very lame: the world was wonderful before the church came along? We all got along. Really, we did. The puzzle solving was strange. Ron Howard used the same techniques that he used in "A Beautiful Mind." They really don't work here. I mean they don't even give a hint what was going on in Langdon's mind. The apple sequence at the end with the moons and the planets whirling around. Didn't help.<br /><br />I was mostly bored I guess. The book was lame, but it was a page turner. The movie wasn't even that.<br /><br />Ah yes. The special features. I picked the interview with Dan Brown. It  was very lame. For example, they had a section called "Research." He spent a year researching the book and a year writing it. That was all the content. There was no comment on how he conducted the research.  Just how long he spent on it. Fascinating. I didn't have the guts to try the other features. I was still slapping my face trying to wake up from the movie.</p></body></html>

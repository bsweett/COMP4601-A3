It is a beautifully shot and acted film with some minor historical faults.  Some people were dragged into the quiet story, but I was a little bored and found that the movie didn't really flow well for me.  I love films that showcase Native Americans in a positive and accurate light such as Dances With Wolves or A Man Called Horse, but this film just wasn't as captivating as those films were for me.  If you do like this film(rent it first) there is a longer (15 minutes) British version you might want to pick up.</p></body></html>

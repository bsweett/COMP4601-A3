<meta name="summary" content="Another great Scorsese film!"></head><body><p>There are in this world mental institutions that are brightly lit, orderly and clean. These places are filled with disturbed patients, and an overworked, but determined, staff of orderlies, doctors and nurses who all do their best to help the people under their care. They are kind and do everything they can to improve the lives of their patients in the hope that some day these sad people might be released.<br /><br />You will never see one of these places in a movie.<br /><br />The asylum in Shutter Island, the latest film from famed director Martin Scorsese, is a dark, sullen place. It is filled with shadows and dripping water and fading light. The staff is occasionally helpful, but mostly obstructionist and occasionally downright dangerous. This is the movie asylum taken to the nth degree.<br /><br />To this asylum arrives Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), a US Marshall investigating a locked-room mystery where, somehow, a patient, who was in there for killing her three children, has managed to escape. With his newly-assigned partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), he meets the deputy warden (John Carrol Lynch), who, as usual in these pieces, explains the rules of the asylum, takes their guns and shows them inside.<br /><br />Once inside they meet Dr John Cawley (Ben Kingsley, in his best role in ages), as well as a German, one Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow). Daniels doesn't trust the German, and hasn't exactly had a warm spot in his heart for any Germans since he was part of the squad that liberated Dachau.<br /><br />From there things get strange. A storm lashes the island. The missing woman turns up. Someone else goes missing. Memories get confused and Teddy's ability to tell reality from fiction starts to fade rapidly, bringing up the question of how contagious insanity might be.<br /><br />This is a very good film. It's not Scorsese's best, but it's easily up there with The Aviator and is better than Gangs of New York. True, he's not at the top of his form, but his second-best is still better than most director's mangum opuses (opii?).<br /><br />The acting, especially by DiCaprio and Kingsley, is truly top notch. The cinematography and sets are nicely creepy without being too overwhelming. The ending is perhaps a bit muddled and might take a couple viewings to make sense, but this is a film that's worth seeing again and again. It is easily the best film of 2010, at least so far.<br /><br />From the trailer you'd think this was a creepy, nearly supernatural thriller, but it's much better than that. It's a voyage into the mind and to a place where you really, really hope that all your dreams don't ever come true.</p></body></html>

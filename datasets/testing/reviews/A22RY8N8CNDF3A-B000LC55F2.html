<meta name="summary" content="Dark Magic That is Hard to Understand -"></head><body><p>"The Prestige" was made in 2006 and the time the action starts is the dawn of the 20th Century.  The story is about the obsession between rival magicians Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who endeavor to reveal each other's secrets.  The competition escalates and the two illusionists start performing riskier tricks that turn deadly.<br /><br />The ending is just not expected or satisfying.  The complexity of the movie requires the audience to hang on every word and scene.  Overall the movie is interesting, sometimes thrilling and exciting, and worth the watch.  Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine and David Bowie also star in this movie about the dark-side of magic</p></body></html>

He is hired to train the &quot;modern&quot; Japanese army in defense of Samurai warriors who persist in rebelling against modernization of the Japanese culture.  Cruise warns that his troops are not ready for battle and his prediction proves to be correct when he is defeated and captured.  He learns to respect the Samurai as he lives among them and learns their ways.  They return him to his people, but he begins to see that nobility lies with the Samurai and not with those who are trying to modernize Japan.  It is all quite simplistic and the characters are pretty much stereotyped.  There are lots of battle scenes, but never does this movie touch the emotions of the viewer.  There are tears shed, but they are all shed by the actors and not the viewers.  This is an epic film which fails to be a great one.</p></body></html>

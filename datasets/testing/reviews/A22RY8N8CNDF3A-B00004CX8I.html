Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched) and Will Sampson (Chief Bromden) also provide outstanding performances.<br /><br />McMurphy is sent to the mental institution for supposedly deranged behavior, initially is repelled by his fellow inmates, but then rallies to their defense as an anti-establishment reaction to Nurse Ratched's intimidation of them.  Even electroshock therapy doesn't stop McMurphy's antics.<br /><br />However, after another patient kills himself worrying about Nurse Ratched telling his mother about his behavior, McMurphy tries to kill Ratched, and undergoes a lobotomy in retaliation.<br /><br />The movie ends as Chief suffocates McMurphy so he can "escape" with him and throw off Nurse Ratched's control.</p></body></html>

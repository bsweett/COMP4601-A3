<meta name="summary" content="Honest Look At One Man's Obsession"></head><body><p>This film is a brilliant and honest look at one man's obsession.  The story told here is not so much one about saving bears as it is about how far a person will go to escape reality.  Treadwell was not a scientist nor was he learned about the true nature of animals, however he had a passion and he stuck with that passion up until his final moments.  Was he crazy, insane or mentally ill...maybe, but that does not detract from the importance of his underlying message.  Sometimes it takes someone who is a little "off" to show the world how "off" everything else truly is.  Getting a glimpse of Treadwell's unedited moments were what truly brought this film home.  Without seeing that, the viewer would have had much less understanding about who the man really was.  Emotional, riveting, and wonderfully put together.  So much more than just a nature film.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

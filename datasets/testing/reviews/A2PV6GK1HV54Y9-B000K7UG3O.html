Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker shine in their roles, but I am not sure as why they needed to flash Terry Bradshaw's butt about half a dozen times! McConaughey plays Tripp, he is 35 years old, and still lives at home with his loving parents. He traps women and then pushes them away after he takes them home and they stumble upon his folks, his parents desperately want him to leave the nest so they hire Paula (Parker) who is motivational life coach, she starts to fall for Tripp and eventually he discovers Paula is not who she claims to be. I liked this movie, it doesn't take itself too seriously, good harmless laughs. I highly recommend it, enjoy!</p></body></html>

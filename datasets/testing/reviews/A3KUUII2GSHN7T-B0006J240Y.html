<meta name="summary" content="The standout film in a weak fall lineup."></head><body><p>I'd been scouting the upcoming films and it didn't look promising. So when I saw a trailer for The Forgotten, I said to myself, "This is a godsend." My conjecture was right on the money. This is an outstanding film; in fact, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10 if possible. The premise is solid, with only a few weak points, and the special affects are stunning.<br /><br />As for plot.......<br /><br />A mother's life suddenly turns from bad to horrid when all the remnants of her dead son - pictures, video clips, etc. - suddenly turn up missing, as if he's been completely wiped-out from the memory banks of the world. Is she going nuts or is there something more sinister at work here? Well, the latter soon proves to show its menacing-self at just the right moment.<br /><br />I can honsetly say I was on the edge of my seat for the last half of the film, and I'm usually a brutal skeptic in my criticism of film.<br /><br />With a fall lineup that included Alexander as the looming blockbuster(gag me with a wooden spoon), this film will probably go overlooked. But that doesn't mean it's not the standout film of the fall.</p></body></html>

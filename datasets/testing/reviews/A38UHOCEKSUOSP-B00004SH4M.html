<meta name="summary" content="Bond reaches his peak in this film that is truly like owning a piece of gold"></head><body><p>Dr. No was a wonderful start to the Bond franchise.  From Russia With Love returned with even more.  Now, Goldfinger has brought the series to the peak.  The highest budget of the three has been granted to Goldfinger, thus creating impressive action sequences and shot in teriffic locations.  But don't stop there.  Goldfinger is packed with memorable moments that places this film in the category of ultimate classic Bond.<br /><br />While SPECTRE was never referred to in this film, I never missed it or thought about it once.  Auric Goldfinger and his henchman "Oddjob" went above and beyond as the villains of this film.  Auric is obsessed with gold, and his ultimate plan is to destroy the gold supply of Fort Knox, so that his own supply can multiply ten times in value.  Oddjob's business is to take care of 007, and takes great pleasure in attempting so, armed with a hat sharp as a knife and martial art skills that are no match for the double 0.<br /><br />Goldfinger is a great feel good movie, highly entertainig - especially for its day.  Every scene is wonderful, whether it is action, brilliant lines and moves by the villains, chemistry between Bond and Pussy Galore, or sneaky and intellgient games such as the Goldfinger/Bond scene on the golf course.  But the showstopper is certainly the grand finale, operation "Grand Slam" where Auric and his men take over Fort Knox.  Oddjob and Bond have a final showdown inside that is a terrific matchup that was accompanied without music, and worked out quite well.<br /><br />The story to Goldfinger is smart and fun, but maybe not as in-depth as the previous From Russia With Love.  But overall, this Bond film has it all and is possibly the most balanced Bond film ever made, giving us a complete film of entertainment that is unforgettable.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Charcaters - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 5</p></body></html>

As director, producer, co-writer  and star of this show, Kevin Spacey hits some highs, as well as some lows, in this bio pic.<br /><br />First of all, not only is Kevin Spacey a great actor, he is also a terrific singer, as well as an agile and nimble dancer. I thought that, at times, especially when playing the older Bobby Darin, he had Bobby Darin down pat. Although the film tried to reconcile the issue of Kevin Spacey's age in the film through the cinematic contrivance of a film within a film, I just could not buy Kevin Spacey as the teenage Bobby Darin, no matter how hard I tried. For me, this was a glaring weakness through the film.  Moreover, I found the use of flashbacks a little confusing at times, especially as the teenage Bobby Darin looked exactly like the older Bobby Darin.<br /><br />While artistic license was certainly taken with Bobby Darin's life, I think that<br /><br />the film does a yeoman's job of hitting some of the highlights of his life. Born to a working class Bronx family in 1936, he was baptized Walden Robert Cassotto. He grew up believing that his grandmother, Polly (Brenda Blethyn), was his mother, not knowing that Nina (Caroline Aaron), the woman he knew as his sister,  was really his mother. He would discover the truth much later on in life, and it would be hard for him to reconcile with the truth.<br /><br />Bobby Darin contracted rheumatic fever as a young child, an illness that left his doctor concluding that he would not live past the age of fifteen. Growing up with the sword of Damocles hanging over his head, where every day could be his last, Bobby Darrin lived life to the fullest. Under the early tutelage of Polly, a former vaudevillian performer, he developed an affinity for song and dance. This would be the catalyst for all he would do and become in life. Nina's husband, Charlie Maffia (Bob Hoskins), would help the young Bobby, becoming a father figure and an important member of Darin's entourage, along with Steve Blauner (John Goodman),  Darin's best friend turned manager.<br /><br />Bobby Darin would hit the silver screen and star in a number of films, including one where he would meet his future wife, the teenage beauty, Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth). Their marriage was to begin with many hope and dreams, but they would find that the silver lining in their cloud of happiness would soon tarnish, as professional jealousy and unhappiness would begin to set in. With Bobby Darin's personal demons unleashed, as well as Sandra Dee's, it is little wonder that their marriage turned rocky.  The film takes the viewer through the good, the bad, and the ugly in Darin's life until his death in 1973 at the age of thirty-seven, when his heart finally had enough.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey dominates the film, as his is the central role. Moreover, he is simply a talented singer and dancer in his own right. I just found it to difficult to buy him as the teenage Bobby Darin and therein lies the rub. I think that he let his ego get the better of him in that respect. Still, his is a riveting performance. Kate Bosworth was decent in the role of Sandra Dee, although I did feel that she simply had too contemporary an edge. Bob Hoskins, as always, is simply terrific. He imbues the role of Charlie Maffia  with  an avuncular charm and warmth. Brenda Blethyn is wonderful as the down to earth and loving Polly. As Nina, Caroline Aaron is a bit histrionic, at times, but effective, nonetheless. Of course, asides from Kevin Spacey's magnetic performance, the music is simply terrific, especially if you loved Bobby Darin's songs.<br /><br />Those who are fans of Bobby Darin will enjoy this movie. If one is not, deduct a star from my rating.</p></body></html>

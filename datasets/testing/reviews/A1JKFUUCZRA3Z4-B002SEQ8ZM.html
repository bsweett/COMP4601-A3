<meta name="summary" content="The grass isn't always greener on the other side"></head><body><p>This movie has a slow start, but picks up steam once the main character, Coraline, discovers a small portal into another dimension at her new house. That other dimension looks exactly like the world Coraline lives in now, except the people there have buttons for eyes.<br /><br />But an even more important difference about this other dimension is that all the people there cater exclusively to Coraline's ego by making her the center of attention.  This treatment is in stark contrast to her real world where her distracted parents treat her like a pest.  It's no surprise then that Coraline becomes seduced by all this flattery.<br /><br />But like the saying goes, just because the grass looks greener on the other side doesn't mean it really is. Coraline learns the hard way that if someone is pouring on the flattery, they usually have an agenda.  Heck, there are grown adults who still need to learn this lesson.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this movie, but the reason I only gave it 4 stars was because I was confused about which age bracket this is targeted for.  The lessons here would be good for kids to learn, but there are some scenes that are too adult for kids to watch. The first is the opening scene with a doll that's kind of scary.  And the second is the scene where you see a large breasted woman wearing nipple pasties and thong underwear.<br />These two scenes felt out-of-place in an otherwise meaningful and visually delightful movie.</p></body></html>

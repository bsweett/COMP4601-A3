However, all it did was remind me of why people don't make movies like this and why Science Fiction Theater 3000 got many laughs from an implausible plot and horrible acting.  The sad thing is... this seemed intentional.<br /><br />If you are looking for something different from today's science fiction, this might be for you.  If you are looking to see what science fiction used to look at, you might like to take a peak at this.  If you tend to like the direction science fiction is headed and don't want to look back, skip this movie.<br /><br />I fit the in the last category and wish I hadn't wasted money on this rental or the time invested to sit through it all.</p></body></html>

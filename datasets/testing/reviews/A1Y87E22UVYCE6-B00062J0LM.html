<meta name="summary" content="From the Gulf's Sands to the Capitol."></head><body><p>First of all: I haven't seen the original movie "The Manchurian Candidate", so I can't compare both versions of the story as many other reviewers have done.<br /><br />The present movie is a techno-thriller more or less routinely done without any outstanding feature.<br />If you consider that director Jonathan Demme has directed "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991) and "Philadelphia" (1993) and expects a film on par, you'll be disappointed (as I was). On the other hand the movie is quite entertaining, even if it is a minor opus, enough to deserve being watched.<br /><br />The story follows Maj. Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran, that little by little realize something "strange" has been done to him and his patrol mates pending a three day lost period in desert.<br />He starts a one-man crusade against all odds to uncover the dreadful plot leading to manipulate next USA's Vice-President.<br /><br />Denzel Washington as Maj. Marco and Liev Schreiber as the Candidate give solid characterizations. Nevertheless, in my opinion, is Meryl Streep as Sen. Eleanor Shaw, the candidate's powerful and ambitious mother, who gives the best performance of the film.<br /><br />This movie is a good standard pastime.<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

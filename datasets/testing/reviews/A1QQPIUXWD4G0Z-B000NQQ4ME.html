<meta name="summary" content="A Very Original Film"></head><body><p>A quite original film by Mel Gibson and perhaps one of the only films portraying the lives of the Maya.  Although a somewhat uncomplicated plot, the original setting,  costumes, and acting, make this film worth watching.<br /><br />The plot is rather formulaic in that it revolves around a captured man attempting to flee his captors and to save his family.  The film is original in that it is set in the Mayan civilization just before the Columbian period and the language is entirely in a Maya dialect.  The cinematography is excellent and the anthropological representations fairly accurate.  The focus of the Mayan civilization's moral decline seems to be a computer recreation of the great city of Tikal which was very well done.  The depictions of human sacrifice were pretty graphic but essentially a fair representation of Meso-American rituals and world views.  The film carries the suspense pretty well all the way through.  Overall, the screenplay was decent, the cinematography excellent, as well as the direction and editing.<br /><br />This was a great film and another accomplishment by Mel Gibson.  This film's results at the box office seem more the result of Mel's anti-semitic faux pas of the time than anything else and shouldn't discourage viewers from renting it on the presumption that the film was bad.</p></body></html>

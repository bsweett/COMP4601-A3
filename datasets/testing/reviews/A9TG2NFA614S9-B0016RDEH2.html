<meta name="summary" content="Realism and Fantasy Collide"></head><body><p>This Mexican movie in Spanish with English subtitles operates on two levels. One is about a detachment of Civil Guards in Franco's Spain in 1944 at a campsite fighting the remnants of rebels from the Civil War. The cruel and nasty Captain Vidal heading the detachment is well played by Sergei Lopez. He has married and impregnated a woman who brings her ten-year old daughter to meet the wicked step father.<br />The picture's other level involves magic, fantasy, sprites and the labyrinth of a faun (called Pan in the English title). The girl, Ofelia, finds the labyrinth where she becomes entranced, and it may well be a dream world that she has conjured up. She is counseled by the faun-satyr.<br />The rebels versus the Civil Guards is standard stuff, but it was the fantasy element that gave the picture its three Oscars. Director Guillermo del Toro's blending of the realistic and fantasy worlds makes the film arresting.<br />The movie is worth seeing, but don't expect this to all to end like a fairy tale. The movie has a sad and downbeat conclusion to a brilliantly conceived project.  From the beginning with the stick that becomes like Tinkerbell, you get drawn into this labyrinth and become engrossed in the film's dual level structure. Recommended.</p></body></html>

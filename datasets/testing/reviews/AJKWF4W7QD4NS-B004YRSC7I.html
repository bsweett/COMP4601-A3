Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife. That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise. The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened. Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories. Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos. Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side. Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well. Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor. All in all, those looking for something delightfully different and intelligent should definitely give Memento a well deserved look.</p></body></html>

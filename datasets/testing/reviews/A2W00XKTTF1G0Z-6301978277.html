<meta name="summary" content="Jack Lemon, Tony Curtis And Billy Wilder Equals Marilyn!"></head><body><p>Some Like It Hot (Referred to as SLIH) the best film Billy Wilder ever made. He is one of the classic directors Hollywood has ever produced and he assembled the best cast and crew ever in this film. Voted as the American Films Institutes number one best comedy of all time. SLIH is the peek of comedy at its best.<p>With a cast that includes my favorite actor of all time - the late Jack Lemon - Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis, SLIH is a hysterical romp of the twenties that show two musicians running from Chicago mobsters because they saw a crime (a killing) being committed. The antics of these two musicians leads them to a three-week stint in an All Girl band. So, they dress for the occasion. Let me tell you - there nothing more funny then seeing Jack Lemon in drag. And with Curtis as the Straight-Man (I mean Straight-Women) as his sidekick - the laughs are large.<p>Marilyn sings up a storm in this one and plays a not-so-bright blonde who is trying to stay away from Saxophone players. (They keep dumping her.) The scam works until Curtis falls in love with Sugar (Monroe) and then has to play another phony - a rich millionaire with a yacht.<p>The DVD extras are very cool. There is a great interview with Tony Curtis on the making of the film. He is the only surviving cast and crewmember left. There is also a great interview with four of the girls in the band. They all talk about Marilyn's problems and issues and the fact that working with Billy Wilder was the best thing they had ever done. There is also a photo retrospective with a lot of behind the scenes shots.<p>This is a must for those fans of the comedy film. This film is fun energetic and just plain laugh a lot a minute. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. 8-6-02</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The screenplay is certainly bad, but De Palma destroys this film"></head><body><p>The Black Dahlia may be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Brian De Palma's directing is among the worst in Hollywood (at least Michael Bay is entertaining).  De Palma makes such an abysmal mess of this story that I wonder if he wasn't sued for purposely train-wrecking James Ellroy's novel by the same name.  Since there's nothing much positive to say about the movie, let's spend some time ridiculing its many faults.<br /><br />First, De Palma manages to preempt every actor's attempt to dramatize the incoherent script and stock noir dialogue.  Scarlett Johansson is given absolutely nothing to do, and De Palma films her doing nothing.  Her character comes off as entirely irrelevant.  She wears the same color outfits throughout the entire movie.  She looks like a throw pillow designed to accent the wallpaper and sofa rather than a character in a movie.<br /><br />The royal pool boy, Josh Hartnett, is miscast as the brooding Dwight "Bucky" "Mr. Ice" Bleichert (yes, he has three first names).  Hartnett is too pretty to be moody and too young to be a believable noir male lead.  The noir male has seen everything.  He doesn't cry.  He looks rough, has a cold stare, and says tough things.  Hartnett does none of these convincingly until the very end of the film, when most sane people have already taken the movie back to the store to rent Beerfest to get the bad taste out of their mouths.<br /><br />While most of the cast is comprised of character actors and miscast noir stock, the only actor who comes away unscathed is Mia Kirshner (who plays Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia herself).  She understands that her character is a corpse, and she engages the audience's sympathy directly.  And she manages this with bad dialogue from a screen test for a porno film.  The other lead actors fail to create believable characters, and her fine performance seems wasted.<br /><br />The earth tone palette of everything in the movie (costumes, furniture, buildings, lighting, etc.) fails as a 1940s fa?ade.  Why must films from the era of the American gangster be compulsively drenched in sepia and silhouetted by smoky shadows?<br /><br />De Palma and his editor, Bill Pankow, really need to quit working together.  Neither is able to piece the story together in a convincing manner.  Three stories are lined up side-by-side: The Black Dahlia's death, a troubled cop and his reformed prostitute and her pimp, and an incestuous Hollywood family.  It sounds crazy, and it should have been, but De Palma and Pankow manage to make it utterly boring.  They rest the movie's success on Josh Harnett's weak narration and clunky acting.<br /><br />But maybe it was just a stupid story from the get go.  The screenwriter, Josh Friedman, certainly deserves to be mocked incessantly for writing such nonsense, but being that De Palma's films are generally terrible, I can't assign blame to Friedman solely.<br /><br />The movie desperately wants to be L.A. Confidential, but it lacks the directing, acting, compelling story, editing, and overall polished production value one should expect from a feature film.  Skip this one.  There are better neo-noir films out there: Chinatown, Road to Perdition, Red Rock West, to name a few.</p></body></html>

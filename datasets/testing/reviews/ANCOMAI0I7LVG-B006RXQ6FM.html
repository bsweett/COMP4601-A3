<meta name="summary" content="It has its good points, but the elements didn't come together as perfectly as one would expect..."></head><body><p>I'm going to avoid using the obvious puns here (ala `no doubt about it' or `don't doubt it' or really anything with the word `doubt' in it) and just say this as blunt and straightforward as I can.<br /><br />I really expected a lot out of `Doubt', and while it managed to hit the right tone on a few occasions the end result was very uneven.<br /><br />Taking the helm in directing his own stage play for the big screen, John Patrick Shanley had a lot to live up to.  His play was very well received and so getting it onto the big screen was going to be difficult.  You have to be careful not to do your already adored work an injustice.  Getting the goddess known as Meryl Streep and the impressive Philip Seymour Hoffman to sign on to do your film is a step in the right direction.  Filter in `it' girl Amy Adams and veteran supporting player Viola Davis (the type of actress you recognize for her face, not her name) was also a blessing.<br /><br />But, can a writer actually direct his play on the big screen with the right amount restraint and power to make it enjoyable?<br /><br />I am in the minority here when I say that John Patrick Shanley's direction is probably the best thing about this movie; aside from Viola Davis.  Honestly, he really nailed it for me, and all the deemed clich&eacute; tricks he incorporated (ala the burnt out light bulbs and storm sequences) actually elevated the mood for me and really captured the essence of what `Doubt' was all about.  I even thought that his direction was slightly better than his writing.  The screenplay is powerful indeed, and the moral imposed on us is brilliantly developed; but I must admit that adapting a stage play holds varied obstacles; mainly dialog.  A play is very `dialog' reliant, while a film does not have to be such.  Some stage/screen adaptations remain dialog heavy because the story requires it (ala `Long Day's Journey into Night') but for the most part, if done right, the dialog can be trimmed and the surroundings can be used to emote what mere words cannot really convey.  I feel that Shanley's effort to transfer his play was only partially successful in that regard.  There are sequences that are almost boring because the words are not backed up by the needed emotion.  This could be a problem lying mainly in the actors themselves, but I feel that in some instances the dialog could have been trimmed to leave room for the actors to act with more than just their mouths.<br /><br />Take Viola Davis for instance, an actress who has a mere eight minutes or so of screen time and really only a mouthful of words to say and yet she manages to capture every ounce of this woman's state of affairs and dances circles around Streep.<br /><br />Aside from Davis the acting gets a little more hit-or-miss for me.  Amy Adams is serviceable yet nothing spectacular at all.  She hits the right emotional confusion in her final scenes, but it isn't anything truly noteworthy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in some scenes, and by that I mean VERY good.  In others though, he almost disappears into the background.  It's not that his performances is bad, because it's not, it's just that he lacks his usual strength in some scenes.  Streep was a surprise to me.  I had heard a lot said about how campy her performance was, but I didn't believe it.  Honestly, it's not wholly campy as much as it is just uneven.  She doesn't seem to have a complete handle on her character, and that's not something I've ever seen out of Streep.  Some scenes she's nearly flawless and yet in others it was almost as if a completely different actress was doing the role; and then to get walked all over like she was by all of her co-stars (Davis stomps all over her, Hoffman dominates her in their final confrontation scene and even Adams steals her thunder in the scenes finale).<br /><br />This is not `prime' Streep.<br /><br />The films subject of faith and morality, of suspicion and pride, of maliciousness and ethics is delicately handled and for the most part effective.  When the film ends the viewer is left with the same feeling of `doubt' Sister Aloysius is left with, so the film is effective.  It's just not as effective as it could have been had all of the elements come together as I expected they would.  I know that this is a raved film that landed on quite a few top ten lists and managed five Oscar nominations, but I'd only give it one (Davis in UNDENIABLE) and leave it at that.  I'd recommend it, sure, for it is not entirely without merit but I would not label it a masterpiece or even a `must see' film at all.</p></body></html>

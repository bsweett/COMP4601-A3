<meta name="summary" content="Pace Is Slower than Novel or Other Movies"></head><body><p>I wouldn't dream of not seeing this as Harry Potter, whether in print, audio or film, has been a most wonderful experience for me.  However, I did wonder after seeing this movie, whether it had been a mistake to divide the last book into two parts. This is because the pace is slower than either the novel or the other six movies.  No one ever divided the other movies into two parts, however.  This made the other movies not waste a second whereas in this one the pace is a bit more leisurely.<br /><br />That being said, this otherwise brings the novel faithfully to life.  Harry, Hermione and Ron are on the run as they hunt for the horcruxes to destroy Lord Voldemort.  There is an added wrinkle they learn though when they hear the story of the Deadly Hallows from Luna's father and Hermione.  This added wrinkle is told visually with what may be puppets and is the most visually arresting part of the movie.  Whoever did this sequence did an incredible job.  It is a fabulous piece of art and storytelling.<br /><br />Lord Voldemort as played by Ralph Fienne is absolutely magnificent.  Every time he is onscreen, the story is just wonderful. The makeup and prostheses used on him also recreate the oddly disfigured creature he became when he returned to the world.<br /><br />If the second part is extremely well done, then the two parts, when viewed together, may end up being a 5 star experience.  As it is, one is left a bit unsatisfied at the odd truncation point of this seventh film, a part one rather than a whole film.</p></body></html>

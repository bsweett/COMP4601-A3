<meta name="summary" content="SPEAK SOFTLY LOVE"></head><body><p>A truly brilliant film worthy of the five major Oscars it won:  Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay.  In bringing Thomas Harris' blood curdling novel to the screen, director Jonathan Demme keeps everything moving and adding some truly creepy atmospheric touches.  Jodie Foster is marvelous as FBI agent Clarice Starling who enters into a bond with notorious serial killer Hannibal Lechter in trying to uncover the identity of Buffalo Bill, another heinous killer on the loose.  Anthony Hopkins won his Oscar for a little over 16 minutes of screen time, making him the only actor to win the big prize with the shortest screen time.  However, his performance is so mesmerizing and chilling he is unforgettable.  Scott Glenn offers fine support as Jack Crawford, Foster's boss whose respect and subtle admiration for her character spearheads her chase.  Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill doesn't have a lot of screen time, but he is perfect as the demented killer.  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS spawned two rather inferior sequels, but this film is picture perfect from start to finish.  A modern classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HELLISHLY AND FIENDISHLY GOOD HORROR  9.25 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I'd never really heard much about this horror film until I received it for Christmas. I had absolutely no idea of what I was getting into, but I must say I was very impressed with this horror film. It's no wonder it's a horror classic. While most critics were in favor of it (62% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), there were some who whined and complained about it. Roger Ebert gave the film an awful half-star out of four and said it was "uninspired" and "not scary." Most certainly not!<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: There is a mysterious box that when opened can unleash the pleasures of Heaven or the pleasures of Hell. It starts off with a man named Frank who buys this box and unfortunately unleashes the pleasures of Hell from it and gets taken to Hell where he is tortured by demons called Cenobytes. Then we are introduced to a couple; Larry and Julia who move into Frank's house (They don't know that he's dead). Frank was Larry's brother, but it turns out that he had a relationship with Julia while she was married with Larry. When the couple is moving in their stuff, Larry accidentally cuts his hand on a nail, and when he goes upstairs to the attic (Where Frank died and where Julia is at reliving the memories of her and Frank), he bleeds on the floor. After he, Julia, and his daughter Kirsty return from the hospital, Julia hears a strange noise upstairs and when she investigates she finds a hideously grotesque person who looks like a rotting corpse, but still alive. It turns out to be Frank, and that Larry's blood brought him back so he begs Julia to help bring him back, which means she has to bring people back to the house and kill them. But the daughter Kirsty starts noticing strange things about Julia, and learns of the box as well.<br />MUSIC: This film had really eerie music. It fit the mood of the film pretty well and was creepy too.<br />ACTING: For the most part the acting was pretty good, except for the actor who played Larry. He was flat-out awful and was also given moments of bad dialogue. Thankfully, the rest of the acting is good and you can forget about Larry.<br />ACTION: This film starts off a bit slow, but once it gets going it proves to be a very interesting and strange horror film. This film is also twisted and disturbing and is filled with all sorts of hellish things. This film is also both gruesomely violent and excessively sexual in demeanor, but unlike most horror films, the sexual aspect doesn't get annoying and is actually done tastefully. This film was a creepy, disturbing, surreal nightmare that oozes with style.<br />OVERALL: It's a definite horror classic, that every horror fan needs. Unlike what Roger Ebert said, this film is rather inspired and very unique. There is nothing quite like this film. Moral lesson overall: don't play with weird boxes.<br />THE GOOD: Interesting story, good music, good acting, imaginative, gory, and stylish.<br />THE BAD: The actor who plays Larry sucks and the film starts off a bit slow.</p></body></html>

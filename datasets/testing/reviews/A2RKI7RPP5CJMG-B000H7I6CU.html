<meta name="summary" content="Pixar's Latest Crowd Pleaser"></head><body><p>The guys over at Pixar must be drinking some really good stuff.  It seems that no matter what ideas that they come up with, they always manage to make a great film out of them.  "Cars" is a prime example of that.  When I first saw the trailers for this "vehicle," I have to admit that I had absolutely no interest in this film.  However, my daughter wanted to see it with one of her friends and I, along with my wife and my daughter's friend's mother and brother, headed out to see "Cars."  It was wonderful.  Granted, it isn't as good as some of Pixar's other efforts, but it suffices as a family comedy that everyone can watch together.<br /><br />Much like "A Bug's Life" and "The Incredibles," "Cars" relies heavily on good-natured comedy to plug its message into the audience.  The story starts off with a race that's being lead by hotshot rookie, Lightning McQueen, eternal runner-up, Chick Hicks, and the elder racer on his way out, The King.  After the race ends in a three-way tie, it's decided that a race will be held in California to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is determined to get to California first and pushes his Mack truck, voiced by Pixar staple, John Ratzenberger, to drive on through the night to get there.  Of course, Mack falls asleep and McQueen is accidentally dumped in the middle of nowhere, a nice little town called Radiator Springs.<br /><br />Once there, McQueen is introduced to a kaleidoscope of funny characters voiced by the likes of another Pixar staple, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, Cheech Marin, George Carlin, and Tony Shalhoub.  Larry the Cable Guy, who's the least funny of the "Blue Collar" guys in my opinion, makes this flick worth it for youngsters.  He supplies the bulk of the comedy for the kiddos.  Other voices that some, especially race fans, might pick out are Richard Petty (The King), Dale, Jr. as Junior, Mario Andretti as himself, and others such as Bob Costas, Katherine Helmond, and Michael Keaton.<br /><br />While in Radiator Springs, McQueen learns that it isn't always the person who comes in first or has the most bobbleheads of themselves that makes them happy.  It's just being in the place you need to be no matter what the circumstances.<br /><br />The story does run a bit long for a film focused primarily on children, and it doesn't hold up as well as the last long Pixar flick, "The Incredibles."  However, there's just enough laughs and in-jokes for parents and kids to make it through.  This isn't one of Pixar's best films, but it's still a fine addition to their catalogue.<br /><br />Highly recommended to families, especially if you have race fans in yours.  Pixar was perfect in capturing the thrill of a race, with great angles on all the racing action.</p></body></html>

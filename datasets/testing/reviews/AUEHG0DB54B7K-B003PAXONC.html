<meta name="summary" content="A Suspensful Thriller"></head><body><p>I have read several stories by Richard Matheson but not I Am Legend, so I do not have any expectations but I can unequivocally say that a book can never be transitioned to the screen as written; telling a visual story is far different from developing a story on the printed page.  For my wife and me I Am Legend is a terrific thriller that does not let up.  Will Smith gives an excellent performance as Robert Neville who decides to remain behind as Manhattan is cut off from the rest of the world to battle a man-made virus. The emotion level that he reaches in his portrayal beautifully conveys the commitment of his character to find a cure that will save those infected by the virus.  His relationship and devotion to Sam the German Shepard is a joy to watch and becomes distressing for us when Sam succumbs to the virus.<br /><br />Although other reviewers found the film slow I liked the pacing.  First we learn what it is like being the last human on Manhattan by observing Robert Neville performing his everyday chores and activities. We get to know him.  Flashbacks tell the story of Neville's family and their escape from New York into the supposedly safe are beyond.  He has been on his own, alone except for Sam, for three years, and it is the emotional toll, his desperation for someone to talk with, that Will Smith makes so convincing.  He does not meet another human being until the last quarter of the film when Anna saves him from the infected.  When he finally meets Anna, Neville finds it a bit hard to communicate right away and finds her optimism that anyone has survived to be doubtful.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Will Smith's daughter, Willow, and Salli Richardson as Neville's wife, very brief but nicely played roles.  Although I have seen several virus/zombie films like 28 Days Later and the Dead series by Romero I did find the creatures in this film rather creepy.  The scene where Sam follows a deer into a building held a lot of suspense for me.  The creatures do look a bit unreal sometimes and I took them all to be CGI generated until I learned that someone actually played the "Alpha-Male" that attempts to capture Neville.  There are some things about the film that do stretch the imagination a little.  My wife was wondering how destroying the bridges into Manhattan would stop people from getting off the island: couldn't someone build a raft or simply swim.  Was Anna on Manhattan the entire time or did she travel to the island?  There are a few questions like this that are not essential to the story but make one wonder, and require a book to answer all of the sub-plots.<br /><br />I Am Legend is a film that requires more than one viewing to take in marvelous design of a New York being taken over by nature and I think one would be better able to see all of the facets in Will Smith's performance.</p></body></html>

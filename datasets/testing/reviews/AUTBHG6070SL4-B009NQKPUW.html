Charlize Theron, in particular, put on an exceptional performance. Her character, with never a gelled blond hair out of place, came across as steelier and more robotic than the robot character. On anyone else with a gorgeous figure like hers, the cat-suit would have enhanced the feminine side - on her, it just smoothed over those human little bumps and folds, giving an inhuman impression of plastic perfection.<br /><br />What's not: Pretty much everything else. The space-suit helmets reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019BI1DM">Outland</a> - the lights pointed inwared, conveniently illunminating the characters' faces, but blinding them in the process. Utter lack of quarantine against alien biota wroked well for the plot but badly for common sense. The android's bio-sabotage of a fellow crewman came across without feeling - not even malice or greed, just one more chore to get done. And, although enjoyable in itself, Noomi Rapace's underwear scene just couldn't compare to Sigourney Weaver's back in the original Alien.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien</a> movies, and Weaver's "Ripley" character in particular, this comes across as a perfectly adequate SF/monster flick, maybe a cut above in its production values. Alien is iconic, though. Prometheus gives it nothing to fear in its position at the head of modern scary-monster movies.<br /><br />-- wiredweir</p></body></html>

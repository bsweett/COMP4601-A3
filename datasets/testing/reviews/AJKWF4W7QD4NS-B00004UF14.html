<meta name="summary" content="A thoroughly enjoyable ride"></head><body><p>Loosely based from a 1990 comic book series, this 1997 blockbuster combined eye popping special effects, classic sci-fi fare, and off the wall comedy and featured Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Agent's J and K respectively.  Both of whom are members of the MIB: a government organized secret group who keep the knowledge of extra terrestrial life under wraps while keeping the planet at peace.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld handles the film very well and keeps it at a crowd pleasing speedy pace throughout most of it's running time.  While it does start to lose steam towards it's climax, where Men in Black shines is with the casting: featuring Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub, and Vincent D'Onofrio in lively roles, with D'Onofrio being his usual scene stealing self.  This Deluxe Edition of the film seems like the umpteenth time MIB has been released on DVD; but out of all the previous editions this seems to offer the most bang for your buck.</p></body></html>

GUN, IS SOMEWHAT MORE LOFTY!<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL:RALPHIE IS A BOY ON A MISSION -- A CHRISTMAS MISSION<br /><br />Here we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.<br /><br />NEVERTHELESS - FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:<br /><br />We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: "YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!<br /><br />To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to "THE MAN" - SANTA, to enlist his support.<br /><br />BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!<br /><br />For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having "BLACK BART" and his gang all "pushing up daisies" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and "Old Blue" [his Red Ryder].<br /><br />We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a "Triple Dog Dare"! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?<br /><br />We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.<br /><br />Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited "Little Orphan Annie" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.<br /><br />There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for "The Grand Canyon Suite" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw "A Christmas Story" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that. All in all, this is a great film to have on DVD as it seems to shout - PLAY ME AGAIN!</p></body></html>

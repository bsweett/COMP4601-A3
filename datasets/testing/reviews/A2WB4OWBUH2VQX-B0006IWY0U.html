<meta name="summary" content="A Great Film!"></head><body><p>This movie does know what it's trying to do...and does it quite well. The reviewer below seems to want a simple story and complains that the movie is misguided in its purpose. I strongly disagree. The film centers around Crowe's character and his doctor/friend and their VARIED adventures on the ship. The beautiful part of this film is its complexity. The music is memorable, the cinematography is awesome and the storyline is satisfying.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The modern "Film Noir"..."></head><body><p>1997's "L.A. Confidential" is a film noir easily worthy of its hardboiled 1940's predecessors such as "The Maltese Falcon."  "L.A. Confidential" features a complex plot, a set of morally ambiguous heroes, a damsel in distress, and some terrific retro sets and story lines.<br /><br />The centers around three 1940's L.A. detectives, superbly played by Guy Pierce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey.  The length of the movie (over two hours) allows them to be painted in subtle and very human shades of gray. Guy Pierce plays Ed Exley, son of a prominent retired policeman, smart and slickly ambitious.  Russell Crowe plays Bud White, a two-fisted cop out to fix the wrongs he witnessed as a child.  Kevin Spacey plays Jack Vincennes, technical advisor to Hollywood crime drama producers and cynical enforcer of the Hollywood code.<br /><br />A seemingly minor Christmas-shift crime draws the three men into a complex scheme of official corruption and coverup, featuring Kim Bassinger as a high-priced hooker who portrays prominent actresses, Danny DeVito as a gossip columist, and James Cromwell as a shady Chief of Detectives.  The three detectives, each for his reasons, finally measure up to their oaths as policemen.  They will pay a high price for doing the right thing.  One is murdered, one is seriously wounded in a thrilling and horrifying gunfight that is the climax of the movie, and one only just escapes death and disgrace by outthinking the man at the center of the coverup.<br /><br />This movie is very highly recommended as superb entertainment in the classic film noir genre, presented by a talented cast and featuring a fascinating plotline.</p></body></html>

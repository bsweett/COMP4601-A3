<meta name="summary" content="Too far fetched... GREAT ART DIRECTION"></head><body><p>Interesting film here...<br /><br />The trailer sells it as a comedy (a mix between slapstick and romantic and caper).<br /><br />But the film is something else. Slevin (Hartnett) is visiting a friend (who you'll never see) and gets mistaken for him. So he is dragged to the presence of a big mobster (Freeman) who forces him to become an assassin. The mission? To kill another mobster(Kingsley)'s son. But the other mobster also drags him to his office and forces him to collect some money... and all seem to be a big vengeance plot orchestrated by an international assasin called Mr. Goodkat (Willis) for something that happened 20 years ago (that we see as the film's prolog).<br /><br />Having briefly explained the plot in 25 words or less, let me say that this story gets more and more unbelievable and far fetched as it goes. This is one of those stories who would never work... and the screenplay is so formulaic that nothing that happens in the end is surprising.<br /><br />A formulaic screenplay? Yes, because as it goes, you see exactly which parts of the story are deliberately left missing in order to be explained later. You know exactly when an action is interrupted in order for you to get the truth later.<br /><br />But there are good things... the cast is magnetic: Willis, Hartnett, Liu, Freeman and Kingsley.<br /><br />AND THE ART DIRECTION IS TOP NOTCH!!!!!!<br /><br />The wallpapers are beautiful, and the fabrics... and the style... you don't see one empty inch on the screen who hasn't been worked (well). Even when it does no look like it was. This film should be in the books.<br /><br />The art direction alone should make you see the movie.<br /><br />This is an average film.</p></body></html>

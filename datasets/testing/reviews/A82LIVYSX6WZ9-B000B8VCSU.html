<meta name="summary" content="Eminem's ok, but the movie is a let down"></head><body><p>its let down by its sense that, ok, hes a rapper trying to fit in and have a good life but thats basically what we see, rapping, but theres the reason of in the end of course he's gonna outrap the people and of course this is somewhat based on his life, but Hanson does a good job with Eminem's reason for his family and thats what really brought this to a two star movie rather then a 1 star movie. Mehki Phifer with dreadlocks dont cut it as well. Murphy is annoying as Eminem's girl and Basinger trys her best but cant cut it. all in all im sticking with what I told and im staying there. plus its let down also by that guy who shoots himself, hes so boring. it was like I was sitting there and when ever something stupid would come on id try to go but then right after a good thing would ome on and id stay and thats what is was like when I watched</p></body></html>

I also thought that Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway did great jobs playing their wives-the only thing I have to say is that Anne Hathaway's hair looked very strange toward the later part of the film.<br /><br />Lots of people might make fun of the movie, saying that it is immoral to portray two men in love, but it is a sweet simple story and watching two hot guys making out in a movie is pretty interesting.</p></body></html>

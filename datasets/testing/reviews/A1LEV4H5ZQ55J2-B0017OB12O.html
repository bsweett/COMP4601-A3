<meta name="summary" content="Intense Struggle of Determination"></head><body><p>This is a story of an intense struggle between the fanatical determination of a Japanese POW camp commandant (Sessue Hayakawa) and its senior ranking English POW officer (Alec Guinness) who is every bit as fanatical.<br /><br />William Holden plays the only American in the camp and manages to escape early in the film.<br /><br />The POW camp is set on the River Kwai (the film is shot in Ceylon) with the mission to construct a railroad bridge within a certain timeline. The commandant is reluctant to shoot or even punish disobedient prisoners because he needs every man to complete construction of the bridge. Alec Guinness understands the commandants situation and gets concessions that undermine the code of this proud Japanese commandant.<br /><br />William Holden manages to return to the sight of the bridge with Jack Hawkins and several satchels of plastic explosive to provide a sad but surprise ending to this great story.</p></body></html>

Setting aside all the Tom Cruise weariness we all have, I can at least admit that it was a passable action movie, and a decent spy thriller. This time out, we even have a team working with the Cruise character, so it's not just Tom-going-it-all-alone.<br /><br />Well, why am I disappointed? In a nutshell, it was too much like the TV series Alias, and not enough like the TV series Mission: Impossible.<br /><br />You see, I may be young, but I'm not that young, and I do remember the original TV series, which was much more...cerebral.<br /><br />I've been struck by such thoughts several times in the last few days. HBO was showing Star Trek: The Motion Picture recently, and I was struck by the slower pace, the intelligent conversation, the deliberate pondering of deeper questions... I remembered thinking, back in the 1980s, that that film had been too "technohappy", by taking the time to show off the Enterprise in spacedock before it departs to engage with V'ger. Now, I've come around to a better appreciation for the film, and that style of film-making, in which the film-makers acknowledge that some things do really take some time, and that things should occasionally be more cerebral.<br /><br />Other examples of this:<br /><br />  * We don't see the shark in Jaws until more than half of the movie has passed us by.<br /><br />  * Think about how long it takes for us to see the cape come out in Superman.<br /><br />  * Now, just compare the original Planet of the Apes to the Tim Burton remake.<br /><br />  * Most of Rocky is not the fight.<br /><br />To me, there's a difference in pacing that all of these examples have, over most movies made today.<br /><br />So, I guess I'm faulting M:I III for not being enough like the TV series it was based on...not slow and cerebral and deliberately paced. Yes, it's an action movie, with a villian excellently played by Philip Seymour Hoffman....but we barely get to see him, and we barely get to know any of the team characters, and there's only the one old-style M:I get-the-bad-guy setup, and we rush right through it.<br /><br />I guess that, sometimes, I'm tired of wanting a little more than I actually get.</p></body></html>

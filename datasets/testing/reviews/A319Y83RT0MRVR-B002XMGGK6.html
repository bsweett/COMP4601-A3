<meta name="summary" content="typos don't always mean a bad plot"></head><body><p>An intense thriller that contains more than one nail-biting scene. There are also quite a few gruesome scenes in the way of horror movies. Gerald Butler delivers his role with aplomb. This movie asks a lot of moral and ethical questions and answers possibly none of them. Although I wouldn't look at this film for moral fiber, I'd definitely turn to it for a diversion, and for another look at how divisive the justice system is. The most bothersome thing about this movie is the fact that the title isn't hyphenated.</p></body></html>

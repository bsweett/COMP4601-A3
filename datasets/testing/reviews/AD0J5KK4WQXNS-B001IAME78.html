<meta name="summary" content="The Hulk we should have seen"></head><body><p>If you are interested in a Hulk with high calibre acting and character investment but that's short on The Hulk and action sequences then go watch Ang Lee's The Hulk instead. If you felt that Ang Lee's The Hulk was like something out of a Danielle Steel novel and just want to see the comic book realized onto the big screen with lots of action upon action and are prepared to sacrifice character content for monsters throwing each other through buildings then The Incredible Hulk is exactly what you want.<br /><br />The Premise is quite simple and works as a sequel to Ang Lee's The Hulk even if it does change the story somewhat. Bruce Banner (Norton) finds himself in South America learning martial arts techniques to control rage while the military try to get him to convert his unique biology into a weapon and dose up a super solider to track him down only to find that the super solider has lost control and so they need The Hulk to save the day. That's it in a nutshell.<br /><br />Overall this flick is pure cannon fodder. You can sit through it and come out satisfied that you have finally seen Marvel's The Hulk on the big screen. At the same time it is no Batman or Spider-man but that is probably the character's limitations even if Norton does but in a good effort. If you want to see things getting trashed left, right and centre with some very good special effects then The Incredible Hulk is where it is at.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding adaptation of the book!"></head><body><p>1983 in Los Alamos New Mexico at Winter time, 12 year old boy Owen (Kodi-Smith Mcphee) has been bullied many times for one night, a mysterious girl named Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) with her weird father (Richard Jenkens) move next door. Owen and Abby become friends later on as she has a dark secret is that she is a bloodsucker including her dad who must feed on blood all the time at night, however she can change Owen's life forever.<br /><br />A surprisingly excellent yet un-needed remake of the 2008 Swedish masterpiece "Let The Right One In" when it's a re-adaptation of the Swedish novel from Joe Ajicde Linqvist for American audiences. In fact the author approved of this movie as a respectful re-adaption of the novel, this is Hammer's first movie in many years since the 70's as they are back in business. The film's acting is truly terrific even by Elias Koteas who plays the police officer in this movie and there's some good gore effects that are well done, it's also a kind of retro movie that takes you back to the 80's as there is even some pop songs from that time like David Bowie's Let's Dance and it's a very respectable remake that does things as both the same (But not all the way like that horrible Psycho remake) and new in some parts. It's by far one of the best horror remakes of all time as it earned it's critical acclaim, watch both films of Let The Right One In and this one at the same time to see how good both are. I applaud writer-director Matt Reeves of "Cloverfield" fame of doing a terrific American rendering similar to how "Magificent Seven" was a great American remake of "Seven Samurai" or "Fistful of Dollars" was a terrific American/Italian/Spanish remake of "Yojimbo".<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives off quality flawless picture and sound like you would see in a theater with good extras like audio commentary, featurettes, car crash sequence step-by-step, poster gallery and trailers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good but its no USUAL SUSPECTS."></head><body><p>The hype about this film is the plot twist however it does not turn out to be half as good as what people where saying about it. It is a good ending to a film in a Hitchcock sort of way but does not come close to the twist scene in the Usual Suspects but it is still leaps and bounds ahead of say - Identity. The film is mostly shot in reverse and that is a very cool concept that is committed to the screen in a very daring and remarkable way. Great entertainment value but not the best plot twist we have ever seen by a long shot.</p></body></html>

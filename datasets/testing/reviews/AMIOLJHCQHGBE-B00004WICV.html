<meta name="summary" content="one of the most complete movies I have ever seen..."></head><body><p>The best adaptation of a Stephen King novel to date. Hollywood allowed this film to develope the various characters unlike most King adaptations.. There is a smoothness of this film, and a sadness as it nears its inevitable end, which holds the attention and completely disregards the 3+ hour length. Any who have seen it, will always remember it. Myself, I try to see the uplifting side, the hope the final monologue touts, but every time I watch this film, I feel the horrible sadness created by people wronging others with malice and hate. Something that does not belong in this world, but something this movie embraces.<br /><br />Michael Duncan Clark, as John Coffee, is the spritual heart of this film. It made his career. He plays the wrongfully convicted man who supposedly murdered two small girls. But he never defends himself, being too simple and too PURE. As the film unfolds, he is found to Tom Hanks and others to be a creature of God. He is able to see into peoples' hearts, and know their wrongs. Being simple, he is unable to block the pain and suffering people have brought him. He is only able to absorb the pain (physically) and while on the Mile, send the pain (physically) to the evil who spend time there.<br /><br />In my mind, this is the role Tom Hanks will hold as the pinnacle of his career. He plays the walk boss on a Texas 1920's death row, which is known as the Green Mile. His character has steadfastly executed inmates with no remorse, until John Coffee. Not only does Coffee cure Hanks bladder and prostate problem, Hanks is witness to Coffee curing a brain tumor from the wife of the warden. It is then that Hanks understands his charge is more than just something special. He is redemption.<br /><br />The theme of Coffee's gift is shown as he revives life into Mr. Jingle's, a mouse living on The Mile. The mouse becomes the final comfort to a mild mannered killer played by Michael Jeter in one of his final roles (his last role was in Open Range).<br /><br />Anyone reading this, has already seen the film. I am not touting the film so much as sharing the what viewers already know.<br /><br />I compare this film to Pay It Forward in its ability to make the viewer feel. And THAT is what a movie is supposed to do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good concept and fine acting but the script leaves much to be desired"></head><body><p>The phrase "the bucket list" has become part of our culture.  The concept is to make a list of all the things you want to do before you die and then do them.  Seems like a good idea.<br /><br />This 2008 film, staring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is based on this concept.  These two men are fine actors.  They bring their years of experience, subtleties of expression and past fame to their roles of two terminally ill cancer patients who meet in the hospital and then go off to live their dreams before they die. Nicholson is the rich one who can finance all sorts of adventures for the two of them.  Freeman is the hardworking family man who has worked all his life as a mechanic and never got a chance for a formal education. Together they make a good team and their performances are excellent.<br /><br />The script, however, leaves much to be desired.  First of all, it is NOT a comedy although its publicity makes it seem so.  Second of all, it is just not real.  Terminally ill patients don't have the stamina to go sky diving, big game hunting in Africa, etc.  Freeman's life is all family and just too sickly sweet.  Nicholson's final reconciliation with a daughter who hates him contains no surprises.  And the film itself, instead of being uplifting, is actually sort of depressing.<br /><br />However, this movie has one big redeeming value.  It makes a person think about his or her own life and what is really important.  And if a film can do that, it has achieved something more than just plain entertainment.</p></body></html>

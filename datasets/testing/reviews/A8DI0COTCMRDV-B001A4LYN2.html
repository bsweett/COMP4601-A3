P.T. Anderson's "There Will Be Blood"(in my personal opinion)is a masterpiece! Now I'm not the most educated reviewer here on amazon so I speak for myself and do not intend to push on you what you should think about this film(or any film for that matter). For me the story that is being told  is always very important, but never as important as the way in wich the storyteller chooses to tell it. "There Will Be Blood" is a brilliant example of a director taking a ordinary tale of good old american greed and turning it into an extraordinary tale of how the darkness of the human soul tends to destroy the lighter more intelegent side. This is no "good guy, bad guy" movie. This is real life where everyone has a good and bad side and(I quote Daniel Plainview)where religion is nothing but a superstition. This is a place where power cries out to the ugly side of life and money pumps the veins and keeps our 75% souless existance moving foward and will surely be the reason for our demise. It seems a few reviewers here at amazon pretty much(in so many words)believe that they would have made a better movie than P.T. Anderson but to each is there own. A film like this was meant to provoke the viewer and leave it up to the individual to come out the otherside gripping his or her own conclusion and/or opinion in the same way a painting or a song can. All I know is I truly was moved by this film and all it's components especially the score and cinematography and still hold true to my opinion that Daniel Day Lewis may very well be the greatest actor alive!</p></body></html>

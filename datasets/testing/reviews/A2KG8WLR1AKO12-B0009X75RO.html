<meta name="summary" content="Musical Lovers Must See Chicago"></head><body><p>Do you enjoy musicals? This is the only question you need to ask yourself before deciding to see Chicago. If the answer is yes---then you must make sure you view this movie first on a large screen. A dvd or video version should be your second choice. Director Rob Marshall has put together a fast paced comedic musical that is utterly fantastic. The songs are of top notch quality. There's rarely a momentary pause in the action. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and others normally thought of as serious thespians perform splendidly in atypical singing and dancing roles. One, though, gets the distinct impression that these actors were thrilled to accept the challenge to get back to their early roots. Most of their characters are scoundrels, liars, and back stabbing slime balls. They are also very funny and endearing.<p>Two pre-World War II ambitious women entertainers, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Zellweger) have murdered their lovers. Gere portrays the sleezeball attorney Billy Flynn who is committed to the proposition that anyone willing to pay his $5,000 fee should not pay for their crimes. Moreover, he hopes to exploit their notoriety to help them professionally. Flynn believes it's only appropriate to turn a murder charge into a wise career move. To put it mildly, he does nothing to uphold the honor and moral uprightness of the legal profession. Could William Shakespeare have been thinking of a Billy Flynn when urging that all attorneys in Henry VI be put to death? The only nice guy is the cuckolded Amos Hart (John C. Reilly) who is too dumb and naive to realize that everybody is playing him for a fool. Queen Latifah is wonderful as the manipulative jailer. Christine Baranski, Lucy Liu, and Taye Diggs also deserve honorable mention. Chicago most definitely earns five stars.</p></body></html>

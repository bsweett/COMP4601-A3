Andy, who has never heard of the magazine or Miranda Priestly before her interview, is bewildered as she watches the Runway staff frantically running around in an effort to be ready when Miranda arrives early to work that day.  Also, Andy doesn't make a very good impression due to the lack of fashion sense that she apparently has.  However, though Miranda is initially not impressed with Andy, Andy taking an opportunity to speak up for herself ears her the privilege of working for Miranda in addition to Miranda's other personal assistant Emily (Emily Blunt).  Though thousands of women allegedly would do anything to work for Miranda, Andy's enthusiasm for the job is not great as she comes to grips with running errands such as getting coffee, buying scarves or some other odd, if not impossible, task (such as obtaining a copy of an unpublished "Harry Potter" novel) that Miranda expects to be completed usually sooner than is possible.  Andy is also reminded by Miranda, Emily and other Runway staff, such as Nigel (Stanley Tucci), that she dresses terribly and really isn't taking the job seriously.  Not wanting to be fired, Andy starts to make a greater effort to fit in as a Runway employee, which includes getting an entirely new wardrobe of top-designer fashions, but not with the approval of her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) or her other friends.<br /><br />All in all, with good writing, brilliant acting (Meryl Streep earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress), good direction under David Frankel and engaging characters, "The Devil Wears Prada" is a very entertaining film that earns 4 out of 5 stars.  Though ostensibly a chick-flick, many men may not enjoy watching this film; but anyone who has had a difficult manager to work for will probably get a good laugh.</p></body></html>

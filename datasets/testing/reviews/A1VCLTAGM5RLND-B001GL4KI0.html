<meta name="summary" content="Milla Jovovich is just as action in this just like her "Resident Evil' movies"></head><body><p>Hey, people, this isn't meant to be a complex, psychological, mind twisting movie, it is just meant to entertain the audience. Even a 10 year old has more sense then you people.<br /><br />But it's goal is not to have a complex plot, but to be full of explosions, head twisting effects and crazy stunts. It is a good action/sci-fi movie, in which Milla Jovovich plays "Violent". I am just amazed that in todays world look at the advancement of medical science.<br /><br />The CGI effects could have been done better, there are scenes with the motorcycle that simply look like an old moto gp game. That's the only part of the movie I hate.<br /><br />They must won't make a "Resident Evil 3", so maybe that's where the "Ultraviolent" comes in.</p></body></html>

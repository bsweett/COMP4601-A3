We all chatted with people on the internet and 9 out of 10 met with them in person and did we don't want to know. This is a twist of real life. The young girl is not so inoccent and digs the truth out of the older guy. The long castrate torture scene got a little boring but that's the only complaint i have. I love this movie. Snatched it up the moment i found it at the store.</p></body></html>

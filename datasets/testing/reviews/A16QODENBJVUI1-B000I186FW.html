<meta name="summary" content="A brilliant adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel"></head><body><p>Although Alan Moore is regarded as one of the giants of the graphic novel, he has not been well served on film.  FROM HELL was a bit of a disappointment given the talent involved in the project, while THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was simply a horror.  Until last year Moore's fellow great Frank Miller had suffered much the same fate, but 2005 should have seen the release of a great version of Miller's SIN CITY and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.  But the subway bombings in London made the studio postpone the original November 5 release date until 2006.  Now that there is a great film version of a Moore classic, the big question is whether anyone will be able to do the same thing with the greatest of all graphic novels, Moore's THE WATCHMEN.  I pray that they won't, that they will realize to do a mini-series instead.  It is simply too complex a work not to receive the longer treatment.<br /><br />This is not merely one of the best film versions of a famous graphic novel; it is one of the finest political films of recent years.  The original political context for the novel was Margaret Thatcher's policies and the attitudes surrounding them in the 1980s.  The politics here have been updated somewhat.  Though Thatcher's policies--especially in regard to immigrants and non-whites--struck many as mildly fascist, a host of the policies and actions of George W. Bush and the Religious Right in America have impressed many as even more so.  I don't want to say that the United States is in danger of becoming a fascist state, but I will say that the kind of world envisioned by the Christian Dominionists and Reconstructionists bear startling similarities to the vision of the Nazis, only with God inserted into the center of things instead of the German people (and I write this as a Christian who is frightened by the implications of the political beliefs of some of my brethren).  If V FOR VENDETTA the novel was about the world that Thatcher's England could create if allowed to evolve unchecked, V FOR VENDETTA is a warning of where policies similar to George Bush's could take us.  The parallels are implicit throughout the film, but made explicit in a scene in which Evey is taken into the basement of Stephen Fry's character.  There they see a large poster containing a swastika along with Bush's phrase "The coalition of the willing," a blatant linking of Bush with fascism.  Furthermore, the persecution of homosexuals in the film is intended to recall the Bush administration's playing off the fear and hatred many in the religious right have for gays and lesbians.  And Prothero will remind any viewer of Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  And frequent mention is made of the way the fascist government has redefined words, much as the Bush administration has.  All of these elements have been subtly adapted from the novel to make them more relevant to the present situation.  (If you haven't read the novel, I strongly recommend it, but at the very least one should if in a bookstore pick up the book and read Moore's preface, where he expresses dismay over Thatcher.)<br /><br />But what if you like Bush?  Can you enjoy the movie anyway?  I think one can easily watch it and ignore the political context and have the time of one's life.  And thirty years from now people who weren't born when Bush was president would be able to enjoy it without understanding the context.  Alan Moore's mysterious V is one of the most compelling heroes of the past couple of decades, a moral anarchist in William Godwin's original sense.  He begins the film a complete mystery, a man not only without a face but without any apparent context.  The film as a whole is simultaneously constructed as a revenge narrative, as V deliberately destroys the entire system that made his creation possible, and a mystery tale, as Inspector Finch, played wonderfully by Stephen Rea, gradually unravels the cipher that is V.  There are some wonderful action sequences, but they are never allowed to obscure the fact that this is more a movie about ideas.  In many films the main point seems to be the action, with the ideas merely tacked on, but here the ideas are never less than paramount.<br /><br />I liked just about everything about this film.  Hugo Weaving was superb as V.  One of the things I most enjoyed about the Matrix films was listening to Weaving's Agent Smith converse with Neo, not so much what he said as the way he said it.  Because he spends the entire movie behind a mask, here we have to focus entirely on his voice.  Given the mask, it is amazing that he was able to pull it off.  I loved the look of V's outfit.  The design of his costume and map are very faithful to David Lloyd's original artwork.  The cast was very strong.  I've mentioned Weaving and Rea, but for a political fantasy concerning the future a la Orwell, this has a wonderful assemblage of talent, with fine actors like Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott-Smith, and Rupert Graves.  I very much liked Natalie Portman as Evey.  When I first heard that she was in the film I was mildly alarmed.  She bears little resemblance to Evey in the novel, but my fears were misplaced.  She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.<br /><br />It does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.  I was disappointed that one bit was left out.  Shortly before he dies, V asks Evey to give him a Viking funeral, and she does, by sending him on the train underneath the parliament buildings.  It would have been easy to include those lines and would have required nothing additional.  I think the film is lesser for lacking those lines.  One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.<br /><br />All in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.  It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary.</p></body></html>

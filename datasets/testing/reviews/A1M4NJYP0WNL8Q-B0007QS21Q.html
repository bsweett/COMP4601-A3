The Asimov I grew up reading was a weaver of ideas, more mind candy than adventure story.  But here I found myself in Will Smith's bedroom, and then suddenly catapulted into a wild chase after a purse grabbing robot.  A far cry from the delicacy used by Asimov.  It took a while for the shock to wear off but eventually the conflict between Smith's gritty performance as Del Spooner and his original inspiration in the reminiscences of Dr. Susan Calvin (played by Bridget Moynahan) wears off and the view settles into a film that is inspired by Asimov, but does not imitate him.<br /><br />The sooner that happens, the better, because this is an exceptional film in its own right, even if it does proceed with the speed of a video game.  Smith creates a wisecracking character with a deep mistrust of robots. He is called in to to investigate what appears to be an impossible killing - robots can't kill humans, it's the first law of robotics.  But Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) lies dead and the only suspect is 'Sonny' a Series 5 robot with some surprising circuitry (played by Alan Tudyk).<br /><br />The death is declared a suicide, but Spooner refuses to give in.  suddenly the automated world turns on the detective, whose unlikely ally is Dr. Calvin, a robopsychologist responsible for the psyches of masses of robots about to be distributed around the planet.  One hair-raising escape after another propels the story along until viewers find themselves at a surprisingly reflective conclusion.  Not exactly classical Asimov, but a great story nonetheless.<br /><br />Will does a good job as Spooner, but he is upstaged by Moynihan's performance.  And both are blown away by Tudyk and the animators performance as Sonny.  As you watch Sonny develop from being slightly more simpatico than the scenery into a full-blown personality there are countless moments of surprise.  Moynihan and Smith do their best, but from the moment Sonny turns to Spooner and says "Thank you... you said someone not something." The film belongs to the robots.<br /><br />Excellent animation and CGI create a world that is a retro version of the future - perhaps exactly what Asimov imagined rather than what we would now.  The result is a compelling mix of the outr&eacute; and the mundane that sticks in the mind just as Sonny's wink does.<br /><br />This is not just an action film.  Threaded through it are the same questions that Asimov raised about the nature of self and intelligence.  Robots may never be human, but there are far more than furniture.  And if their thought processes are alien, they are more than the sum of their programming.  The result is one of the more carefully thought out science fiction films in recent times.</p></body></html>

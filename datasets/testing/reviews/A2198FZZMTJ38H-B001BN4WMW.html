<meta name="summary" content="A truly manificent film! Mel Gibson is brilliant!"></head><body><p>This movie is absolutely wonderful, full of brutal depictions of hand-to-hand combat, tears and kisses, love and passion, freedom and strength. Mel Gibson has done a truly terrific job in depicting what is  said to be one of the greatest stands ever taken in history. The  performances are truly believable, as are the battle scenes. And to all of  you who wish that this movie would come out on DVD, it will be released on  DVD in May of 2000.</p></body></html>

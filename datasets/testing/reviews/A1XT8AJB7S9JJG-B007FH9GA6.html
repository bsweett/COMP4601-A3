<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie with great acting. Mara is fantastic. I didn't think it was as good as original. I say B."></head><body><p>"I want you to help me catch a killer of women." Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by a man named Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find his nieces killer who committed the crime 40 years ago. He receives help from the eccentric Lisbeth Salander (Mara) who has her own motives. I had contradicting feelings going into this one. I really loved the original (I haven't read any of the books though) but I was worried about how this one would be but was very excited to see it. I though the casting was perfect but the original Lisbeth was so tremendous that I couldn't see how this could be as good. One of the first things I noticed was how similar Mara looked to the original actress. As the movie went on I started seeing more and more similarities to the original. I realize that this is based off a book so they will be similar but this to me felt like almost a shot for shot remake. It's been a while since I saw the original but it felt like almost the exact same thing. All that said though the original seemed better to me, I don't know what this was missing but I don't think it was as good. I did like this movie though. Overall, not as good as original but very close. I give it a B.</p></body></html>

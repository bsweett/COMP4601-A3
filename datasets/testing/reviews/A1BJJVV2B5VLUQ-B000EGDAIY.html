<meta name="summary" content="U.S. version not as bad as the Asian version... but almost!"></head><body><p>I wanted to like this movie. Especially after friends went to see it in the theater and claimed it was one of the scariest movies they'd seen in years. Wow - should be good. Think again. Turned out to be a joke of a horror film - an utter waste of time. Maybe the big screen, the dark theater, being at the late show at night, and perhaps the full moon and high tides had something to do with how they felt about "The Grudge". For me, this movie was slow, predictable, and down-right disappointing. I don't always need blood and guts in my HORROR movies, but sometimes it sure helps. Ask me what I think a classic scary/horror movie is and I'll respond with "The Exercist", "Halloween", "Psycho", "Nightmare On Elm Street", "When A Stranger Calls", "Final Destination", or any of the old classic Vincent Price films from 30-40 years ago. "The Grudge" being an (Asian) horror classic? Give me a break - this kind of innocent suspenseful horror is weak in my book. Watch this movie and tell me your horrified of the little white-faced kid with the shiney black balloon in his mouth. It just wasn't scary! To top it off, director Shimizu felt this movie was so good - he imported half a dozen American actors to make a 2nd (U.S.) version. The first version being "Ju-on"... also a major disappointment. The two movies are 90% the same... with the exception of the American actors. The same house is used, as is the same sister's apartment, the care center, grocery store, elevator, not to mention script and plot. There is no soundtrack to speak of throughout the movie. The director relies on objects jumping in front of the screen at just the right time accompanied by screeching violins. Sarah "Buffy" Michelle Gellar ("Scooby Doo", "Cruel Intentions", "I Know What You Did Last Summer") continues her roll of choosing below average scripts. Bill Pullman ("While You Were Sleeping", "Casper", "Newsies", "Spy Games", "Independence Day", "Lake Placid") on the other hand, is distinguished as a leading 2nd man... and I was disappointed at his role here (very little dialogue and screen time). A long and tedious 91 minutes to get through. I went in with many lofty expectations - and left with none.</p></body></html>

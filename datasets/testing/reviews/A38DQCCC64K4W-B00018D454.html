<meta name="summary" content="Great For What It Is"></head><body><p>This is a movie that stands on it's own without being a remake. Like the 'Dawn of the Dead' movie in early 2000, this is kind of like a retelling of sorts; The key plotline generally remains the same, but there are some nice changes and unexpected turns as well. I thought the acting overall was really good; Ermey was def. the best surprise here, and the movie had a very sleek look to it that actually complimented it's content. The same cinematographer from the original returns for the remake, and there are some very nice nods to the original; The part w/Leatherface chasing one victim through the clotheslines hung with lots of white sheets was a memorable moment for me..But make no mistake: This movie is brutal in it's violence, and there is alot of it. And while not really 'scary'(except for Sheriff Hoyt...YIKES!!!), this is one intense, horrific ride. The comment on the box read "If you want horror...this IS horror!!".  For once the box speaks the truth. Plus Jessica Biel spends the whole movie is a semi-revealing tank top, so that never hurts as far as I'm concerned...</p></body></html>

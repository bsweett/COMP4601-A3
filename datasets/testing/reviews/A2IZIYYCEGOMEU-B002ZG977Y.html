The 'heroes' are petty, and pouting, and the 'gods' are only interesting because of the actors that are portraying them ( especially Fienes as Hades ). However, the CGI is great, and the only time it's not fun to watch is when the majority of the characters are opening their mouths instead of hacking at monsters. Anyone that seriously anticipated that this remake of the less-than-classic 1981 fantasy of the same name would be anything other than an action-packed, visually pleasing head-rush of a popcorn pic will be seriously disappointed. If you're looking for accuracy in a mythological context, or acting on a par with Tracey, or March in INHERIT THE WIND you won't be happy either.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deserves the Oscar for Best Feel Good Movie"></head><body><p>Don't hold your breathe for that nomination, because the category doesn't exist and how sad for the awards ceremony that there is probably an award for best assistant on set. I was really surprised by this film considering the misleading marketing of this film. By the way it begins though, I was saying, "Man, what did I get myself into?" I stuck through it, thinking that I had rented some High School Musical, but then was drawn by the energy of the children acting superbly. This movie all of the sudden pulls the trigger on you and I was left flacid, weak, and sobbing. I never in my wildest dreams would have guessed it. I mean, By the cover of this thing I was hoping for some uppity Chronicles of Narnia or something. I had no idea I was in for some well acted movie that operates on multiple levels, yet never loses sight of its simplistic yet pure messege. This movie was more like Some Robert Redford Film back in the days when he tackled depressed adolescents coping with torturous loss. This movie is an infusion, a gratifying injection of tenacious feel goodness. Thank God that I stumbled upon this, and NO thanks to marketing.</p></body></html>

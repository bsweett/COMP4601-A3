To find a focus for the film, he documents the fictional story of a poor fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) who is separated from his family and forced by rebels to become a slave panning for diamonds and discovers a pink hundred-carat rough stone he manages to bury near the panning river just before he and his captors are arrested; the rest of the film inviolves a Zimbabwean smuggler (Leonardo DiCaprio) who tries to persuade Hounsou to bring him to the diamond in exchange for the restoration of his family, and a crusading foreign correspondent (Jennifer Connolly, in a wondrously thankless role) who somehow becomes mixed up with them.<br /><br />It's not exactly a boring film, because Dicaprio and Hounsou seem to attract every single arms fire exchange in that particularly violent year; in many ways its almost as white-knuckled a watch as a James Bond film. Unfortunately, like the Bond films, it also relies far too much on coincidence (particularly in the heroes' escapes of impossible situations). Indeed, the film seems to be a kind of melange of all the great Western stories of imperialism and adventure: Zwick seems particularly obsessed with hellish scenes of young Africans writhing in triumph over flaming carnage, which evokes HEART OF DARKNESS (and its film versions), while the search for a mythical diamond evokes KING SOLOMON'S MINES and THE MOONSTONE. But it's all done, somewhat bizarrely, from a very progressive Hollywood liberal point of view, that while laudable in and of itself makes the whole film seem very slickly engineered and at times even condescending: the film ends with a great howler of a sequence where Hounsou is introduced to a group of white journalists by an American diplomat (played by Stephen Collins!) as "the face of the Third World,' and they then proceed to give Hounsou a standing ovation. Hounsou does the best among the leads with his underwritten character; DiCaprio tries hard, and for once doesn't seem quite so much like an ephebe, but his wobbly attempt at a Zimbabwean accent really trips him up. No matter how nightmarish the exchange of gunfire, mortar fire, or even grenades, nothing whatsoever in the whole film seems capable of mussing his and Connolly's expertly cut hairdos.</p></body></html>

There are just not enough words to describe the sheer genius of this movie and it's first time directors/writers. If you ask me this is one good directorial debut for these guys.<br /><br />It all starts when this little boy starts having this so-called blackouts. After the confusing lapse in time, we are brought back to a pivital event that changes his life. We, in the audience know exactly what happens after each blackout, which sometimes are very disturbing given the innuendo that comes with it. But, after getting over his blackouts and documenting his condition, he finds that he is able to rewind back in time and change the life-altering events. But even good deciscions make the worst outcomes. Throughout the movie he is forced to go back each time to change the chain of events which he set in motion. Not only is this a movie with heart, consequences and redemption but it is just a really good change of pace. It does something different. It does something original. And that you can remember for good and take to the bank. Add this mobvie to your collection and you won't regret it. See the theatrical version first if you are getting the dvd. I personally think that that one is the best version.</p></body></html>

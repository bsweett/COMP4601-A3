I truly love this film and happy it made it to my HD Collection!!  During the HD film, i was like, "This is awesome!"  Many times i wore out that saying!  This is by far a great boxing movie.  A great heart conquers!  Although, the ending was not what I wanted, but it was like "Wow didn't expect that" factor!  That is always a good thing about a movie!  A great movie about boxing and determination of one's desire to succeed.</p></body></html>

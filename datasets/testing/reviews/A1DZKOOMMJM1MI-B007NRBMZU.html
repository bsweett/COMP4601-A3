It's not a fun film to watch, in fact, it's very tragic and depressing, but it's also engrossing, well-made, and exceptionally acted. Ashton Kutcher shows that not only can he pull off some funny pranks, but he can support a dramatic film as well. Melora Walters, with her meak voice and undeniable maternal presence, was the perfect choice to play his mother. Amy Smart, beautiful and innocent, was wonderful as Ashton's sometimes girlfriend. She had the most difficult job because she gets to change personalities so quickly, and she pulled it off very well.<br /><br />The film was brutal, way too honest, and at times, very tough to take, but I loved how it didn't shy away from the tragedies in life like most movies do. This is a terrific film, one of the best of the year in my opinion, that manages to leave a mark and lingers in the mind long afterward. It does try to tackle way too much in too short a period, but it manages to crawl under the skin and refuses to come out. After a string of very disappointing Hollywood thrillers, The Butterfly Effect was a very refreshing change of pace; a Hollywood thriller that actually thrills. The theatrical trailer, included on the DVD, did not do it justice.<br /><br />Note: While some viewers prefer the Direcor's Cut of the film, I was surprised because I think the Theatrical Version is a much better film. More tightly paced and with a far superior ending, the Theatrical Version is the definitive one to watch. Out of curiosity though, pop in the Director's Cut on the flip side and watch the final 5 minutes to see the main difference between both versions. While both are emotional, the Theatrical Version has a better ending that is more suitable to the film. Both versions are GREAT, but surprisingly, I prefer the original theatrical one since usually, the Direcor's Cut fairs better.<br /><br />I recommend this film. I absolutely loved it!</p></body></html>

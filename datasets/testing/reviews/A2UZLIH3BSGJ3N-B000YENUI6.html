Slaves give birth to slaves.""></head><body><p>Another dark and depressing subject put to screen by Director David Cronenberg introduces you to a small circle of characters with the Russian Mafia in London as the driving forces and subjects as seen in Eastern Promises. Incredible acting (particularly by Viggo Morteensen) as the "driver" for a mafia boss's hard drinking son Kirill.<br /><br />Our story begins with Anna, a nurse at the E.R who delivers an infant of a dead 14 year old mother Tatiana. The diary she comes across of this young woman's life in a poor and decaying village in Russia and journey with the hopes and dreams of something better quickly introduces her to the slave trade, forced prostitution and heroin. Inside the diary is a very revealing confession that involves both Kirill and his father directly. Anna seeks someone to translate the diary, but in doing so puts herself in the cross hairs of the mafia. So much so, they are willing to kill for it.<br /><br />Nikoli (Mortensen) is slowly climbing the ladder and ranks within this mafia family, and although he puts on a very hard and rough exterior (while not incapable of extreme acts of violence himself) really shows some compassion for others. After being framed for the actual deed of a botched hit, Nikoli narrowly escapes his own death (one of the most violent scenes) and the truth of the diary is revealed.<br /><br />There are no easy endings in Eastern Promises and without giving up too much of the film what can be promised is an agonizing story of cruelty inflicted on those who are weaker. Namely the mafia exploiting young, naive women and selling them to a world of drugs, abuse, and slavery.<br /><br /> Exquisite acting portrayed by all here, but the real transformation of Mortensen is something to see. The story of the Russian Mafia tattoos is quite fascinating and unfortunately much of that was cut from the original screenplay. I wish they would have got more into it on the extra features of the DVD.<br /><br /> Eastern Promises is somewhat of a continuation of Cronenberg's "A History of Violence". How  violence changes people, and is it ever really excused? It gets off to somewhat of a slow start, but it is a fascinating tale with lots of depth and color if one can see it. Well worth seeing, particularly for the performances, Eastern Promises delivers a gritty tale of a harsh, ugly life with some humanity and where not everything is as is seems on the surface.</p></body></html>

It's a hit and miss affair, with plenty more misses than hits here lately with the last few film adaptions of his stories and novels. They are still never less than interesting. And so, we have another film adaption of a short story by King, this one from "Secret Window, Secret Garden". Writer David Koepp writes the story into a pretty good screenplay, emphasizing on subtle tricks and pacing. Johnny Depp stars in the film as Mort Rainey, A grungy, near divorced author with wild hair who keeps to himself in his rustic old cabin in the woods near a beautiful lake. The opening of the film immediatley fills you in on why Mort has gotten to this stage, and why he is living in this secluded cabin. Trying to knock out another story, Mort is quickly confronted by a Mississippi man named John Shooter(eerily played by John Turturro), who claims that Mort plaigarised his "Secret Window" story, and is now out to seek that wrongs be turned into rights. It is quickly obvious that Mr. Shooter is not a well man, and his demeanor quickly turns psychotic and dangerous. Mort swears he wrote his story first, and sets out to prove this fact to Shooter before this strange man causes him, or anyone else, more harm. All at the same time that Mort is going thru an unhappy divorce with his wife Amy(Maria Bello), and her current boyfriend Ted(Timothy Hutton)is sticking his nose in. Charles S. Dutton is along for the ride as a lawyer friend of Mort's who is out to help him with Shooter. Len Cairou also co-stars as the local town sheriff. Isn't there always a local town sheriff in stories like these?. The movie hangs on Depp's every move. Every word. Every action. It's a small cast and it is all basically up to him, because he is in every scene, and a lot of the time it's just him alone. But this is Johnny Depp. It can be garbage, and he will still own every scene. Fortunatley for us, Mort Rainey is an interesting character. Another eccentric in Johnny's long catalogue of eccentric characters that he is a master at. It may not be as big or splashy or memorable as most of his other roles, but Depp infuses enough distinct personality, presence, and tics into Mort, that he is a full fleshed character that carries the entire film from start to finish. Not sure if I liked the hair yet or not. Turturro has always been a great actor, and his portrayal of Shooter is one of immense unease. With this southern drawl, big hat, and laid back ease, his John Shooter is a strange and memorable man. He brings the right balance of meance and humor, without overdoing it. Any time I see Turturro now, I will be seeing and hearing John Shooter. The rest do with what they have. Hutton, who starred in the King film "The Dark Half", is pretty much stuck in the "new boyfriend is a jerk and how can I get rid of him?" role. He's just fine, but it's a role with little in the way of a rewarding outcome. Maria Bello pretty much has the same fate. She does well with the material, but her role pretty much becomes nothing more than the ex turned damsel in distress. Dutton, who is always a likeable and strong presence, doesn't fare much better, but his being there alone elevates the movie. The film moves along at a pretty slow pace. It's not a slam bang type of a rush thriller. It plays it slowly, and lets it all seep in and build. Some may see the ending coming. Some may not. Some may think it's a disappointing cop out, while others see it as a fitting and interesting end. Whichever way you see it, it pretty much works. I was not necessarily shocked with the outcome, but I definitley didn't expect some of the events that did happen in the finale. It's not a really great movie, just a pretty good one. Not the best Stephen King adaption either, but better than a lot of his movie adaptions of late. But this is Johnny's movie, and he does another fine job that makes the movie better than what it is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Looked cool, but I felt absolutely nothing"></head><body><p>Maybe it's the fact that we've had way way way way too many superhero movies lately, or maybe it's the fact that all of these superhero movies we have had lately are ALL THE SAME!!  Sure they're different characters, with different ways they are created, born or transformed, but for godsakes, I can only count 2 that stepped away from the formulaic same old same old screenplay: Dark Knight & X:Men First Class.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA is an interesting film, don't get me wrong, and I'm almost certainly gonna buy the BLu-ray when it's available, but it has pretty much the exact same storyline as Spiderman 1-3, Iron Man 1-2, Batman Begins, Green Lantern etc. etc. etc. Superhero starts out a normal guy, becomes a superhero, learns he has skills, practices his skills, bad guy threatens to destroy the world and Superhero fights bad guy.<br /><br />I know. I know. That's comics. Like I said, maybe it's the oversaturation of these movies on the cinemaplexes. You may ask, what do you want? Well, I want the unpredictablility of DARK KNIGHT. I want the emotions of X:Men First Class. I want to feel my guy tensed up in knots like it did when Sebastian Shaw comes to convince the mutant students to join him, or when the Joker put the two people Batman cared about in different warehouses and you actually... wait for it... wait for it... FELT SOMETHING.<br /><br />I wanted to feel something. I wanted to feel some emotions, rather than just saying, that was cool looking. CAPTAIN AMERICA is cool looking, and for what it is, it's a good movie. It's just, in my opinion, another cookie-cutter superhero movie to throw into the pile with the rest of the superhero movies. Unfortunately, the pile of unique superhero movies is much much much much smaller.</p></body></html>

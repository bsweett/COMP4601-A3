<meta name="summary" content="First Contact... should have been the last contact!!"></head><body><p>This was the last movie that was even halfway decent. After this one, I don't know why any more were ever made. There is so much you can do with the star trek franchise and THIS film proves it. It's the first time they have the screen all to themselves (which is to say without the old crew) and it's the only time that they do a decent job of carrying on the torch that was passed to them by the original crew.<br /><br />First Contact has some of the best actors around. James Cromwell and Alfrie Woodard are positively wonderful additions to the Star Trek phenomena. There were just too many questions left. Too many loose ends left untied. And too many times when I said "so what." during the show. The crew exists as cardboard cutouts of their television personas. The most dynamic character in this movie is the Borg Queen. And that is just amazingly disappointing.</p></body></html>

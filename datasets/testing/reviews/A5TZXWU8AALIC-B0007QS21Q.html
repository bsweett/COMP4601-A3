It actually feels like a blend between BLADE RUNNER (without that classic's bleak and wonderful design) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (the computers and robots come to the same conclusions that sent the Hal 9000 into its homicidal mode).<br /><br />The special effects are really good and the action works.  I was also really thankful that Will Smith plays a character that leaves out all the macho/ethnic posturing I've come to expect from a studio film.<br /><br />Much better than I expected.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MORE MICHAEL MAYHEM"></head><body><p>HALLOWEEN II is probably the only sequel to the 1978 classic that tries to maintain the level of terror and suspense created in the original.  While nowhere as good as the original, this is a well crafted sequel which takes place right after the end of the first.  Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode and keeps her title of THE SCREAM QUEEN as she is whisked off to the hospital to recover from her injuries.  The late Donald Pleasance is also back as Dr. Sam Loomis, the psychiatrist determined to put an end to Michael Meyers' reign.<br /><br />This is the movie that establishes the connection between Laurie and Michael, a theme that will permeate following sequels.<br /><br />Of course, Michael the Boogeyman, is on the prowl and invades the hospital, dispatching several employees including early performances from Leo Rossi, Ana Alicia and Lance Guest.  Michael is more vicious in this one, coming up with more devilish ways to dispose of his victims, and while this is effective, it doesn't parallel the way John Carpenter used little gore in his first and still created almost unbearable tension.  Also, the people who make horror movies must never have been admitted to a hospital.  This hospital is almost deserted; if you've ever been in the hospital, you know it's just as noisy in the night as during the day, and we get no patients or pages in this hospital either---but the hospitals emptiness adds to the chilling factor so dramatic license wins out.<br /><br />All in all, director Rick Rosenthal keeps things moving and this is the best of the many sequels.</p></body></html>

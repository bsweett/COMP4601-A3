<meta name="summary" content="Jules Verne is screaming in his grave tonight ..."></head><body><p>Sure, I'll concede that this film hit the target for the intended audience. It's a family action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has much fast paced action, suspense and light humor.<br /><br />You really have to divorce yourself from reality and even harsh criticism while watching this, because it's very easy for an adult with high-expectations to feel let down. But the truth is, this about the same type of fare as you'll find with films such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC39ZE">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009YXAV">The Apple Dumpling Gang</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V42">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a>, and so on.<br /><br />My wife liked it and thought it was entertaining. However, I'm a fan of Jules Verne books and always have been. I guess I was hoping for more of an adult driven, Steampunk style (see comment below) drama than what I saw. I wish the CGI was better and the mood a little less cotton-candy-ish, but it really wasn't aimed at me and I can concede that. I'm not going to give the movie less than the four stars that it does deserve for the simple fact that with every scene, you can see that Brendan Frasier isn't overdoing the acting and delivers a family movie with a family movie level of acting. Kudos to him for being aware of what he was involved in.<br /><br />This review is about not going into this hoping for an epic telling of a Jules Verne Classic, but going into it with the perspective of seeing a family movie. Hopefully this will help someone.<br /><br />... ...</p></body></html>

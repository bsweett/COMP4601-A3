<meta name="summary" content="Comedy Becomes Her"></head><body><p>Fresh from A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION the incomparable Ms. Streep hits the street this time in designer shoes. And the rest is, as they say. . . As always Meryl Streep shows that she can play any role perfectly. Cast here as the dragon lady of a fashion magazine "Runway," she is of course a joy to watch. Anne Hathaway, fresh from BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, is the recent college graduate who lands a job as an assistant to Ms. Streep while waitng for her ship as a fledgling writer to dock. No slouch herself, she gives Ms. Streep a good run for her money, helping Streep find her own heart, however small. The plot is predictable with only a couple of surprises. After all, this is a comedy; and good always triumphs over evil.<br /><br />These two women have a fine supporting staff; and the photography is spectactular, especially the footage of New York and Paris. I haven't seen so much about high fashion in a movie since Richard Gere wore all those Armani clothes in AMERICAN GIGOLO.<br /><br />So treat yourself to an entertaining movie in these, the Dog Days of summer.</p></body></html>

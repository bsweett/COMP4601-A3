With action packed cliffhangers every turn and the motherload of archaeological artifacts, how can you not enjoy this tribute to the serials of yesteryear? George Lucas and Steven Spielberg created Indiana Jones, Lucas for the nostalgic throwback and Spielberg because he's always wanted to direct a James Bond film (he'd probably be better than the ones we've been getting). Ford abandons his blaster and Millenium Falcon for a fedora and bullwhip, and he's the only one I can see doing this role. Karen Allen is feisty as Marion, who is not your typical damsel in distress. Paul Freeman is charmingly evil as Belloq but at least has ulterior motives when compared to the Nazis. Ronald Lacey I recognized from two (great) episodes of The Avengers and his character in this reminds me of his insane portrayal of one of his characters from that show (Emma Peel episode The Joker). And John Rhys-Davies is a delight as Sallah, a very funny character. The story is very well done, with the Ark displaying only a bit of its ominence in certain scens until the very end. The action sequences, like Lucas' first three Star Wars films, can't be topped, even by today's standards because most, if not all of it, would be CGI. Some of my favorite sequences are the opening sequence in the temple, the fight at the Nazi airstrip and the subsequent chase on horseback. And the incomprable John Williams again delivers an excellent score, giving us another memorable theme, The Raiders March. 5 stars.<br /><br />The Temple of Doom- Despite being the highest grossing movie (worldwide) of 1984, a lot of people have had mixed feelings about this one. I on the other hand, like the darker storyline. While there is plenty of action for which the series is known, this is more of a character/story driven plot. Ford gives Indy more depth, especially when he drinks the blood of the Kali and his concern for Short Round (who is one of the few child characters in a film that actually adds to the story instead of slowing it down). Kate Capshaw's character however is no that helpful as Karen Allen's was of the previous film. The most she does is scream and complain but the character does show a little evolution during the course of the film. Amrish Puri is definately more evil than the Nazis of this and the next film, able to take out a person's heart and sitll leave them alive. The plot device (the Sankara Stones and later the Thuggee cult) is more creative and inventive than just having it be about Christian religious artifacts. The action sequences are on par with those of the first film, the climatic mine cart chase being one of the best. And once again John Williams gives an excellent score, providing a more sinister touch to the film. 5 stars.<br /><br />The Last Crusade- Combining, I think, elements of the first two films (more so the first than second), this is my personal favorite of the franchise. In the opening we see a young Indy involved in one of his first adventures and we discover his fear of snakes, where he picked up the bullwhip and the fedora. The rest of the film is solid. Indy is recruited by Walter Donovan (played by Julian Glover with, in my opinion, a convincing American accent) to search for the Holy Grail after his father (played by Sean Connery in a very comedic role). Assisted by Marcus Brody and Sallah (Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies respectively from the first film) and aided by the mysterious Elsa Schneider, Jones sets out to rescue his stubborn father. There are four former Bond actors in this film; Connery (of course), Allison Doody (Jenny Flex in A View To A Kill), John Rhys-Davies (General Pushkin in The Living Daylights) and Julian Glover (Kristatos in For Your Eyes Only and, interestingly, General Veers from The Empire Strikes Back). All play their parts well, especially the father/son dynamic. Connery and Ford have great chemistry together, one of my favorite scenes being when they're tied back to back in the castle and the room catches on fire and they both call each other. The story is great. Though the main objective for both parties is the Grail, it serves as a metaphor between father and son. Though I am suprised at how we portray God as peace loving yet all of these Christian artifacts are very destructive. Again the action sequences are excellent, some of my favorites being the aerial dogfight and the attack in the desert. Another brilliant John Williams score. Definately one of the better action movies that seamlessly blends in comedic moments. 5 stars.</p></body></html>

It tells the story of a young filmmaker named Kerry Conran who wanted to make a film based on some of the old comic-style pulp fiction that kids grew up with in the 1930's and early 40's. Someone gave me some of those books when I was a kid, and they looked just like Conran's art. Francis Ford Coppola is quoted as having said that one day, the next Mozart would come along and produce a film on his computer in Ohio, or something to that effect. Well, the day has arrived. Conran literally started this film on his computer, with composite photos and artwork done by his brother. They kept writing and piecing together a rough reel to take around to the different studios. The story of their odyssey is amazing, but they finally found people that were interested in helping them; which shows that, if you believe in something that is good and persevere - you'll eventually get there.<br /><br />Almost everything in the film is CGI - which means it was created on a computer - and has a soft, charcoal drawing effect reminiscent of the old 1930's pulp fiction. The few things that are real include the actors, of course: Jude Law as Sky Captain, the fellow everyone calls on when freedom and safety are threatened; Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, the reporter who's in love with him; and Angelina Jolie as Frankie, an old flame and commander of a British "sky station." While the acting is acceptable, you can't expect great performances when everything is blue- and green-screen, and the actors are having to imagine everything in their heads. As wonderful as the film looks, this is no way to make a film.<br /><br />Which brings us to story: it's thin, predictable, and not cliffhanging like the stories it is trying to imitate. I know some think that's the way pulp novels from back then were: maybe so; but that's no excuse - if you're going to make a film for today's audience, you need solid plot and strong dialog, and "style" is no excuse for sacrificing both. There are other films based on popular material from the same period (the Indiana Jones series being the most notable), and they don't sacrifice these elements; so why should Sky Captain?<br /><br />Granted the "look" is fun. There was a lot of naivet&eacute; in the 30's about the technical advances of the future, which the Buck Rogers novels and comic books reveal. The "streamlined" look of planes, trains and automobiles from this period is fascinating, including the industrial design work of Bel Geddes and others. I loved seeing all of that come to life. But this is a movie, not just a walk down memory lane, and we were there to see good drama as well as exciting visuals, and the drama just wasn't there.<br /><br />I think Kerry Conran and his associates had a lot of guts, and I'm glad they made their foray into filmmaking. They proved what could be done in the area of special effects by someone with a computer and a lot of imagination, vision and drive. But they also proved what shouldn't be done: an entire movie built around a look rather than a story. If you don't agree with me on this, go back and watch it again, now that the novelty of the artwork has worn off, and see if it holds your attention the way Twelve O'clock High or other well-written scripts from that period do. The story has to be there.<br /><br />Also, it's not just the script: after a while, the artwork itself gets old. You get tired of looking at too much stylized art, and eventually long for reality. Cinema is a wonderful medium for stylization; but it is primarily a realistic medium, and we want to see that. In cinema, you've got to have at least one foot in reality so that people can believe in and enter your world. Because Sky Captain had most toes dangling in the world of stylized fantasy, with a very thin script to boot, it was really hard to enter that world.<br /><br />At any rate: good effort Kerry Conran and company. I look forward to your next foray. I hope we don't have to wait too long.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

His captivating spectacle "Apocalypto" filmed in the lush, verdant jungles of Mexico, is a depiction of the clash of culture and civilization within the 15th century Mayan empire.  Filmed with a minimum of dialogue, the cinematographically stunning flick expresses it's points well.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw played by Rudy Youngblood, is a hunter in a forest dwelling hunting and gathering society in a peaceful jungle village.  His tribe's existense is shattered when a group of marauding warriors led by Zero Wolf played by Raul Trujillo, sack and pillage his village.  A large group of prisoners are restrained and taken on a dangerous journey to a great stone architected Yucatan city.  There they will toil as slaves or serve as human sacrifices for the gods.  Meanwhile Jaguar Paw had hidden his pregnant wife Seven and young son Turtles Run during the attack in a deep pit within a stone chasm and vowed to return to them.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw was chosen to be sacrificed and slathered in blue pigment to prepare him.  He gets a fortunate stay of execution by virtue of a previously foretold solar eclipse.<br /><br />He miraculously manages to escape, killing chief warrior Zero Wolf's son in the process.  This results in an exciting heart pounding pursuit through the jungle, reminiscent of the film "The Naked Prey", as Jaguar Paw heads back to his family.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the film, we see that although the Mayan civilization had commenced decaying from within, the truly acknowledged destroyers of this culture has begun to arrive, the Spanish conquistadors.</p></body></html>

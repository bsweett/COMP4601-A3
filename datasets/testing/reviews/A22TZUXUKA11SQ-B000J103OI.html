It wasn't really funny, the added plot elements added nothing to the story, and the best thing about the movie was the clothes. It's kind of disappointing how lackluster this film was, especially considering how much it was hyped. It's basically like a cheap Sex and the City without the comedic banter. Meryl Streep was excellent in her portrayal of the Anna Wintour-esque Mirande Priestley, but that alone doesn't make this film worth watching. I'd just wait for it to come on HBO and not waste the money.</p></body></html>

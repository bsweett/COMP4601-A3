<meta name="summary" content="A funny comedy with a heart."></head><body><p>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson show us in this film that they are a great comedy team. That play a pair of long time friends who are close and have the same strange vacation.... the Crash Weddings.<br /><br />The movie sets us up with a montage of how they crash these weddings. And we see that not only do they have a great time, free food & drinks and always get their woman...but also they do it in such a way that you do not hate them. They seem to be the reason the wedding is so much fun. And you know that you would want them to crash your wedding. I think we are also shown this to see that they have developed a formula that they have found to be very successful.<br /><br />Everything changes when they add one more wedding they did not plan for. A wedding of a daughter of a very powerful Washington, D.C. political family. The move in with their formula, but then things starts to go wrong and they start breaking their own rules. And they start to get really involved in the lives of the girls they are chasing and their family.<br /><br />The movie is very funny, but has moments that are tender. Almost turning into a Romantic Comedy, but right before that happens, we get pulled back into the comedy and it breaks the moment. Though you know it was there. It is as if the first half of the movie was written as a pure comedy and then the last half the writers wanted to show character development and slip into a Romantic Comedy. It still works, but if they had gone for one genre it would have been much better. Still worth watching</p></body></html>

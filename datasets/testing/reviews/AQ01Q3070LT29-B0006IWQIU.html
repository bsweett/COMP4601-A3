<meta name="summary" content="Give Alien a napkin!"></head><body><p>In 1979, we were introduced to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ">Alien (The Director's Cut)</a>(1979), not only did it chase Sigourney Weaver around, it scared the water out of us.  This was followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6BM00">Aliens</a>(1986), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXB8">Alien 3 (Collector's Edition)</a> (1992) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXBI">Alien Resurrection (Collector's Edition)</a> (1997).<br />  In 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was trying to hunt down the PREDATOR (1987)--an almost invisible creature that could camouflage itself.  It returned again in PREDATOR 2 (1990).<br />  Now for the first time in film history, ALIEN meets PREDATOR.  You won't see Sigourney Weaver nor Governor Schwarzegger in this film. You will see Lance Henriksen return as "Weyland" from ALIEN 3 and ALIEN: Resurrection.<br />  After seeing this film, I understand why Sigourney Weaver was turning down the rumors that she might do this film. She just simply was not interested.<br />  James Bond fans will recognize Colin Salmon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RPCK1U">Tomorrow Never Dies</a> [1997], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIBURQ">The World Is Not Enough</a> [1999],<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008S2SF">Die Another Day (Full Screen Special Edition)</a>[2002]).<br />  DVD includes a choice of watching the Theatrical version (1:40) or the Extended version (1:42).

McConaughey gets to prance around with an open shirt, and Sarah gets to flutter those pretty peepers.  And that about sums up FAILURE TO LAUNCH, a syrupy, sticky blech-fest (with some really bizarre, yet lame, animal attack scenes thrown in for good measure) that was plucked from two-stardom by some pretty solid performances by several supporters, including Zooey Deschanel, Justin Bartha, and Terry Bradshaw (who knows no decency).<br /><br />A "consultant" hired by McConaughey's parents (Bradshaw and Kathy Bates) to trick (by feigning a relationship) their thirtysomething, fun-loving son Tripp to move out, Parker's character suddenly finds herself harboring romantic feelings.  Wow, like we never saw that coming.  And of course the metaphorical cat gets out of the bag, the ruse is exposed, Tripp gets ticked, and everyone else plots how to get these two stubborn lovebirds back together.  Deschanel, playing Parker's quirky roommate, is so odd she's very, very good, and Bradshaw will stop at nothing to be the center of attention.  His birthday suit scene has me starting therapy next week, yet at least made FAILURE TO LAUNCH immodestly entertaining.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

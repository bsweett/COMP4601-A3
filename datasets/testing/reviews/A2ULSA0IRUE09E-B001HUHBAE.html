<meta name="summary" content="A Three Hour Long Oscar-Worthy Epic"></head><body><p>How incredible is this movie? As a huge fan of the serial killer movie genre, I was quite shocked that they got Jake Gyllenhaal to play the lead here (he was great in "Donnie Darko" but that's the only time I really found his acting believable), but consider that the ensemble piece has Robert Downey Jr and Chloe Sevigny. This is a masterpiece of movie-making, and yes, it IS three hours long, so do be advised before getting engrossed in it.<br /><br />"Zodiac" is in many ways better than the film it is often compared to - "Se7en". That Brad Pitt film had everything going for it, but it was still far too mainstream and commercial for my liking. "Zodiac" corrects that. This is like watching an independent film unfold - slow, languid pacing often builds up to rushes and intelligent plot developments. Real Life events and situations are narrated with precision and clarity. This was especially difficult to do, I am sure, since the entire Zodiac case was too complicated and convoluted in real life, there was no way they could fit all of it into a three hour film and still make sense of it. Still, they achieve the impossible here.<br /><br />Words cannot describe the amazing direction of this film. The actual serial killer scenes are perhaps the most affecting - I can only imagine the amount of research that went into it. Then there are the scenes where the cartoonist (Gyllenhaal) begins to decipher the codes, leading him to a lifetime obsession with the case. The timeline of the film begins in the 1960s and reaches way into the 1980s.<br /><br />Dear Reader, do not be dissuaded by the running time, or the middle of the road reviews here. I call this movie what it is : a masterpiece. In fact, the day I watched it, I was under a cloud of fever, really sick and hacking away, but I went to the movie anyway. When it finished, my symptoms had vanished and I had never felt better. In fact, my interest in all things Zodiac were rekindled and I could perceive things with far more clarity than before. For fans of the crime genre, this particular killer has been of huge interest to us for years, and to watch his story brought to the screen with such love and devotion to the craft of film-making is a welcome gift indeed.<br /><br />Lastly, a word about Jake Gyllenhaal. This is not the most striking man around, nor the best actor, but its his everyday normality that makes him the perfect fit for the role here. Of special note is Downey Jr's amazing performance - this man needs to be nominated for an Oscar. And what about Chloe Sevigny? This woman is luminous in almost anything, and her act as the bookish nerdy housewife here should win her major accolades. In fact, if this is shut out at Awards season it would be a travesty. This has OSCAR written all over it. Amazing, amazing movie.<br /><br />Five Stars. At last a crime thriller with class, sophistication, and worthy of every cent of the hype.</p></body></html>

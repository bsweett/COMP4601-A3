<meta name="summary" content="Jude, Clive, Julia and Natalie get Closer"></head><body><p>This movie dares to shock with its explicit language and demanding performances. Jude Law (Road To Perdition, Cold Mountain) plays Dan, a writer for the obits who crosses paths one day with a lovely redheaded woman named Alice, played by Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith, Garden State). The 2 soon fall for each other and become a couple. Later, Law falls for a photographer woman named Anna, played by Julia Roberts (Confessions Of A Dangerous Minds, Oceans 12) Law writes a book called The Aquarium which sinks. Law plays a joke on Doctor Larry, played by Clive Owen (King Arthur, Second Sight) in which Law and Owen talk to each other in dirty talk in a London Sex Chat Room. Owen meets Roberts at the Aquarium in which Law told him to go to and finds out he was a part of a sick joke. Later, Owen and Roberts get married...Law is still in love with Roberts....Law leaves Portman.....Roberts wants to divorce Owen...Owen falls in love with Portman but he still is in love with Roberts...and you get my point. Nasty...Nasty dialouge in this movie and some nudity but just plain raunchy talk. Law is always good, Roberts is magnificent, Portman plays a role she hasnt done before and she is very, very fantastic...she plays a stripper and Owen delivers in a new role for him as well..he plays a a-hole with gusto...Owen can play anything and still be as good as he is.</p></body></html>

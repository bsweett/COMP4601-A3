<meta name="summary" content="Almost Great"></head><body><p>"The Mist", based on the novella by Stephen King, has a small group of people holed up inside a supermarket after an all-encompassing impenetrable vapor cloud rolls through the entire town.  It doesn't take long before a local man bursts through the doors in a blind panic, blood on his face and clothes and ranting about "something in the mist" that dragged his friend away.  From there we are led on a moderately-paced ride of suspense as strange and frightening creatures emerge from the fog, the death toll increases and the main characters make a last ditch effort at escape only to meet a fate worse than what awaits them outside the safe confines of the supermarket.<br /><br />For those that have been reading all the customer reviews (positive and negative alike), the ending has already been spoiled (and had it not been, I would've had no qualms about spoiling it myself - it's THAT BAD).<br /><br />Quite frankly, I think it speaks for itself.  Let me just say that it's like slapping down $40 for a great steak...and then getting food poisoning.  I did feel pretty sick to my stomach, steak or no steak, after watching the last ten minutes.  It's artistic license at its worst.<br /><br />I was also disappointed to see a talented director like Frank Darabont make a mockery of his previous efforts with an ending designed for maximum shock value.  Instead of giving the story the dignity that it deserves (and King actually SANCTIONED this new and horrific twist), Darabont instead has managed to churn out a movie capped by an outrageous denouement that has absolutely no artistic merit.  For fans of Darabont's previous work (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile), be forewarned - you will have the distinct urge to turn the other cheek at his future releases.  Anyone can shock and/or surprise, but if they do so with proficiency and artistry, they are to be commended.  There is nothing commendable about what Darabont has done to rework one of Stephen King's best stories.  On paper, "The Mist" remains a masterpiece.  On film, it is a near disaster.<br /><br />Having gotten that out of the way, I feel should I point out the movie's strong suits.  The first is the design of the creatures that wander through the mist, especially the larger ones.  Two giants who make appearances first at a halfway point through the film then the other in the last fifteen minutes are quite a wonder of conceptual design.  The screenplay is also good but I do feel that some of the characters are extreme, the religious fanatic in particular played by Marcia Gay Harden.  Of course, every good story needs a good antagonist, someone whom the reader constantly wishes would receive their comeuppance.  To quote from another of Darabont's films (The Shawshank Redemption), "His Judgment cometh and that right soon."<br /><br />Second is the wrenching performance of the film's lead actor Thomas Jane as the film's protagonist David Drayton.  Although I hated the ending, I thought Jane gave a commendable portrayal of a man tortured by his decision.  Also noteworthy is Nathan Gamble as David's son Billy - his performance was neither trite nor maudlin in the least.  Harden is a bit much with her fire-and-brimstone rhetoric as the sanctimonious Mrs. Carmody while the rest of the supporting cast blend in with one another.<br /><br />Bottom line: the film is excellent up until the last ten minutes.  Had a different ending been used and the "gotcha" ending (to quote another reviewer) became an alternative ending, I would've been much happier with it and would've even considered adding it to my collection of DVDs at home.<br /><br />What a shame...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FUNNY HARD GUYS WITH THICK ACCENTS GET VIOLENT"></head><body><p>Guy Ritchie's follow-up to the hugely entertaining gangster caper &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; does not break new ground.  <p>This impressively packaged two disc release includes a great-looking widescreen transfer of the complex and violent gem heist that's peopled with a bunch of heavy-accented oddballs including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones.  Brad Pitt is a bare-knuckle Gypsy boxing champ who apparently speaks a hybrid Welsh-English, but in a funny and completely indecipherable dialect.  <p>In fact, the entire film needs the optional English subtitles, but I think that's intentional.  The point of the movie is that it's all about the comic-book images and the sounds -- not words.  Disc 1 includes full frame and widescreen versions with a funny director and producer commentary.  Disc 2 includes a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, storyboards, photos, trailers and web links.  <p>It all adds up to way too much info for a less than significant film.</p></body></html>

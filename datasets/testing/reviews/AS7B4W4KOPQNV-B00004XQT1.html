<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Dark Comedy..."></head><body><p>This movie was about a total psycho, Patrick (Christian Bale), who has a lust for killing people.  Patrick is very vain and kills people very casually, it's humorous how bazaar he is.  I thought it was pretty funny, but a little too weird at times.  I wouldn't reccomend it to just anyone, not all people are able to find humor in a crazy businessman that goes around on killing sprees.</p></body></html>

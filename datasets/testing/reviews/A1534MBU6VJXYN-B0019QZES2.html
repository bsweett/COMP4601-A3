<meta name="summary" content="I Found It Better Than The First"></head><body><p>I know I'm probably going to get a barrage of not helpful votes like for my reviews of "Monty Python & The Holy Grail" and "Titanic", but I actually found "Meet The Fockers" funnier than the first moive, 2000's "Meet The Parents". I got a lot more of the humor and the additoion of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand to the cast made the film for me.<br /><br />The film picks up some time after the events of the first one. Gaylord "Greg" Focker (Ben Stiller) has finally earned the respect of future father in law Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro), who he is now allowing to marry his daughter Pamela (Teri Polo). However, there is one hurdle they have to clear: meeting Gaylord's parents. Jack is intent on meeting his daughter's future in-laws. So, the Byrnes (including Blythe Danner, returning as Dina Byrnes, and Jinx the Cat) journey down to Florida to meet Bernie Fokcer (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand), Greg's carefree parents. As soon as they meet each other, it's clear that the Byrnes and the Fockers are polar oppsites. The Byrnes (okay, Jack) are conservative and somewhat stuffy. They tell onlyof their achievements and think that a simple handshake is the proper way to show friendship. The Fockers on the other hand are the opposite: they hug people, tell embarassing stories, and dedicate an entire wall to Greg's underachievements. This creates some tension between ex - CIA agent Jack and Greg.<br /><br />This results in several slight but very funny gags. Among them, a football goes horribly wrong, baby Jack drinks booze and sees "Scarface", Greg "speaks the truth" aout what he thinks of everyone, andon top of it all, Gaylord may already have a little Focker of his own.<br /><br />It's basically a rehash of the first movie, but the same schtick is even funnier the second time around. This is a film that I think I could recommend to just about anyone with a bird's taste in movies.</p></body></html>

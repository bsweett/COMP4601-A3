He had seen the movie several weeks before I did and recommended that I see it if I got the chance.  So, when the film came to the local budget cinema, I made a point to watch it.  The film was everything I thought it would be and nothing more.<p>The story itself is pretty average.  Johnny Depp stars as Mort Rainey, a writer who is in the process of getting a divorce from his wife.  He loves his wife very much and really doesn't want the divorce, but she has been pressing the matter for sometime. In the meantime, Rainey has moved out of their home and is living in their summer cabin. He's been trying to finish his new book.  Unexpectedly a strange man wearing a wide-brimmed black hat shows up at his door.  The strange man calls himself John Shooter (John Turturro) and claims that Rainey stole a story from him several years ago.  Shooter wants Rainey to correct the mistake by rewriting the ending to the story.  Rainey claims that he wrote his story several years before Shooter wrote his.  Shooter gives Rainey three days to prove it to him and to show that he means business, Shooter kills Rainey's dog late at night. Thus, a game of cat and mouse begins.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't really go anywhere. The suspense doesn't build up in the right way and the ending of the movie leaves the audience longing for something more.<p>The acting in the movie is rather well done, however. Johnny Depp is almost always entertaining to watch and John Tuturro stands his ground well.  Turturro's silent, yet steady prescence serves as the perfect foil to Depp's frantic and exaggerated style.<p>Overall, the film wasn't all that bad and had some good acting, but the plot left something to be desired. SECRET WINDOW reminded me of another movie based upon a Stephen King story: THE DARK HALF.  I enjoyed THE DARK HALF more than SECRET WINDOW, but if you take the supernatural element out of THE DARK HALF you're basically left with a SECRET WINDOW.</p></body></html>

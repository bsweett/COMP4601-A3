<meta name="summary" content="Homer Would Be Proud"></head><body><p>The classic interpretation of Homer's "The Illiad" comes to life in Wolfgang Peterson's "Troy."  The story is about a young Trojan named Paris who steals a Greek king's wife, Helen (you know, the face that launched a thousand ships!).  Anyways, the Greeks use this as an excuse to conquer the city of Troy, the city whose walls have never fallen to foreign nations.  The Greeks get the warrior Achilles to fight on their side.  The Trojans and the Greeks fight.  The Greeks make a horse with troops inside, in order to enter the walls of Troy and open its doors to the rest of their troops and eventually conquer Troy.  That is the quick overview of the story without revealing too many turning points of the storyline.<p>Brad Pitt plays the role of Achilles.  Achilles fought this war in order to be remembered throughout the ages, not because he believed in the Greeks cause.  He does a very good job at this role and I believed that he is a great warrior.  Eric Bana played Hector, the leader of the Trojan army and a prince of Troy.  Hector was my favorite character of the movie.  He is a very honorable man and well respected.  He stayed true to his country and his family.  Orlando Bloom plays Paris, the person who basically started this whole war.  I was really hoping that Paris would get his in the end.  I just thought that his character was too romantic and didn't care that thousands of people would die so he could have his fling.<p>The most impressive aspect of this movie was Peterson's direction.  I like how he made Achilles have some emotional scenes and have some human aspects to him, instead of being some inhuman killing machine.  The battle sequences in the movie flashed from scene to scene a little too quick for me.  But the highlight were the greatly choreographed individual fight scences, especially the one between Hector and Achilles.  The big battle scenes looked very good and the CGI was not bothersome. <p>This movie is extremely good.  It is very well acted, well directed and the movie moved at a good pace.  The movie is about 2 hours and 40 mins. long and it really doesn't feel like it.  There is a lot of good action in this movie and the storyline is very interested, even if you've read the story and know whats going to happen.  I would highly recommend seeing this movie and wouldn't be surprised to see this movie mentioned in Febuary/March of next year.</p></body></html>

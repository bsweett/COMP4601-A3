<meta name="summary" content="Pretty much your typical horror movie"></head><body><p>Any movie that has Peter Sarsgaard in a supporting role, and fails to show him in any of the trailers, or mention his name anywhere on the DVD box, is confusing to me. On one hand, it's clear that they had the desire to look like a legitimate thriller with a solid cast, but on the other hand, it's also clear that they think their audience doesn't include those who care about thrillers with solid casts. This is the mystery of Skeleton Key.<br /><br />At times it feels like it's not sure exactly what kind of movie it is. Is it another typical horror film masquerading as something deeper by using a well-known female star? Or is it a smaller, brooding film about the fine line between Voodoo and Hoodoo and the dark secrets that can hide in the swamp?<br /><br />Ultimately, it's really a mixture of both. There are the obligatory scenes of Kate Hudson in the shower, walking around the house in her underwear, and the cheesy one-liners that have come to define the horror genre. But there are also some genuinely creepy effects, a good deal of mystery, and a pretty surprising and satisfying ending.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are pretty extensive and make it a pretty complete package, including 20 minutes of deleted scenes, a brief history and description of Hoodoo and Voodoo, and Kate Hudson telling a ghost story from her own life.<br /><br />Really, I have the feeling that The Skeleton Key is more the product of the Louisiana film legislation that gives huge incentives to production companies if they film the majority of their film in Louisiana than anything else. Start looking for more and more films set in the swamp that may not have received green lights from studios, except that the budgets end up being greatly reduced by this legislation.</p></body></html>

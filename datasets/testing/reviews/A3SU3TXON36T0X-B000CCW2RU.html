<meta name="summary" content="A Good Movie About What Happens When Life is Robbed of the Transcendent."></head><body><p>_The Island_ is a movie about a totalitarian system enslaving a group of clones.  This movie touches on many issues which face us in this very day and age.  To say nothing of the gross immorality of human cloning and the unethical disposal of human genetic material (very much endowed with the very breath of life from the Creator), this movie also has much to say about totalitarian forms of government.  In the movie, the clones live in a closed-in society ruled by their masters who have created a situation that pretty much robs life of all meaning.  However, like the crass materialistic culture we live in today which refuses to recognize the sanctity of unborn life, the society in _The Island_ does not recognize the sanctity of the life of the clones.  These clones are herded like cattle, eventually to serve as the unwitting organ donors for their ultra-rich owners.  When the time comes for one of the clones to "win the lottery", they are taken to up to the surface world and there are surgically operated upon against their will, often killed in the process.  The movie features two clones who manage to somehow miraculously discover that they are clones and to escape from this totalitarian dystopia.  They seek to liberate their fellow clones, but first they must find a means to notify their respective insurance policy holders of the true nature of their insurance policy.  However, along the way they encounter several snags which lead to an eventual confrontation with the owners of the cloning operation all under the auspices of the federal government.  This movie has much to say not only about the very unethical nature of human cloning but also about totalitarian systems in general.  It serves to signify precisely what the late Pope John Paul II meant when he referred to modern culture as a "culture of death".  May we heed this warning as we approach a truly brave new world which holds promise but also holds the potential for a total robbery of the sacredness of life!</p></body></html>

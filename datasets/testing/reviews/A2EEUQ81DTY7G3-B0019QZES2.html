<meta name="summary" content="Some funny moments but generally falls apart towards the end"></head><body><p>Meet The Fockers is funny in fits and spurts but it is a fairly typical, unimaginative film. While the actors are all good, and the initial set-up is awkwardly clever, after the first hour the film seems to fall apart. Ridiculous subplots are tacked on, and<br />jokes become forced and tired, especially when half of the gags are recycled from the first film. I think this movie probably suffers from the curse that afflicts much of the mainstream comedy that currently comes out of Hollywood, which is a good idea that starts out fresh, but rapidly becomes stale.<br /><br />Yes, there are some perfectly fine moments, and if you like humor that relies on embarrassment, irreverent slapstick, and crudity, then this film is for you, but the film as a whole just gets so outlandish and preposterous that it's just too hard to totally appreciate. Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with crude humour, as long as it's subtle and clever. Meet The Fockers, however, is hardly subtle and toward the end of the film it isn't even clever.<br /><br />Meet the Fockers finds male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) engaged to his schoolteacher girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) as they are headed off to visit both sets of parents so they can make their much-anticipated wedding arrangements.  Things begin go wrong after Pam's father, former CIA agent Jack Byrnes (a very dry Robert De Niro) insists on traveling in his high-security RV rather than flying. They're on their way to Florida to stay with Greg's free-spirited, new age parents Roz and Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand).<br /><br />Much of the comedy comes from the clash of lifestyles when the hip, lefty Fockers come to blows with the old world, traditionalist Jack. There are mishaps galore that involve the Byrnes family cat, the Focker family dog, Jack's supposed prodigy grandson (played by twins Spencer and Bradley Pickren), and indoor plumbing. And there there's also a subplot involving Pam's pregnancy and illegitimate son that may or may not be Greg's.<br /><br />The talented cast provides all the laughs. Barbra is of course a pleasure to watch, with her cascade of middle-aged curls, she plays the sexy, earthy, and overly enthusiastic sex therapist, Roz Focker to the hilt. Hoffman as Bernie Focker is also a lot of fun - both Bernie and Roz are stereotypes, complete with their open-mindedness, they live in a hippie like hamlet in Florida, that might have once been a commune in a type of Woodstock home.<br /><br />Robert De Niro as Jack accompanied once more by his ethereal wife, Dina (a gorgeous Blythe Danner) probably steals the show - we really feel for him as his back seizes up with tension and he constantly wads his face up into a knot of disgust over the Fockers antics. And Blythe as Dina is a pleasure to watch as she gradually warms to the Fockers hospitality, and quietly tells Jack to behave, while she's secretly having fun watching him squirm with embarrassment. Aimed at an audience that is probably not terribly sophisticated, Meet The Fockers provides some good laughs, but don't expect too much from the overwrought, ridiculous plot, where most of the comedic clich&eacute;s can be seen coming.

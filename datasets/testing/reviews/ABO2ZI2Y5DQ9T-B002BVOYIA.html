More remarkable thing about this film is that it works brilliantly as first-rate thriller set against the background of the actual massacre in Rwanda without losing the touch of reality.<br /><br />Don Cheadle has been known primarily as supporting actor, but in `Hotel Rwanda' he literally became Paul Rusesabagina, true-life hotel manager who saved the life of more than 1,000 Tutsi refugees, housing them in the hotel, using clever and sometimes daring tactics, and doing tough negotiations with the army and the militia demanding the life of the Tutsis inside.<br /><br />And Paul is not the only one who dedicated himself to the impossible task. The film is fair in not forgetting the (if not perfect, still precious) jobs done by other people - Nick Nolte is very good as UN commander, and so is Joaquin Phoenix as journalist. It is slightly regrettable that the role of Tatiana, Paul's wife, played by Sophie Okonedo, is relegated to that of a damsel in distress, but her strong acting saves it from a typical stereotype. Jean Reno also appears (uncredited) briefly.<br /><br />The script by Terry George (who also directed the film) makes use of some of the Hollywood conventions (like one `saved-by-the-bell' episode), and some scenes of the film are, to be frank, implausible. The film is most convincing (and hauntingly so) at the earlier chapters, where the impending catastrophe is palpably sensed in what you can hear in the radio news or in the rumors people talk.<br /><br />As many reviewers said rightly, the film is tour-de-force of Don Cheadle. The real Paul Rusesabagina is a more robust person, but Cheadle embodies the spirit of everyman who just wanted to save his family and do the right thing. Helped greatly by his riveting acting, the film will grab your heart, being constantly unsettling, gripping, and inspirational.</p></body></html>

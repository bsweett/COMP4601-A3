<meta name="summary" content="Goldmember has to be the best of the bunch......."></head><body><p>The first two Austin Powers movies were good but, I've got to admit, I've never laughed quite as hard as I did with Goldmember. This movie was absolutely hysterical. Michael Myers really outdid himself in this one. There were moments when I just couldn't stop laughing. It got to the point where everyone around me was telling me to hush so they could hear what was going on but I couldn't help it.<br />I haven't seen a movie that has made me laugh that much since the first Ace Ventura. You definitely need to get this one.<br />Well...what are you waiting for??? GO!</p></body></html>

She stripped away all pretense of being a glamorous actress and made QE look like a human. As England rises in resentment over the Palace's lack of response concerning the death of Princess Diana, the Royal Family greet the public response as a passing phase. Just how greatly they misunderstood the public's love of Diana completely escapes them, to the point where every concession is met with greater derision within the walls of the royal confines. "Celebrities and homosexuals," sneers Prince Phillip when he hears of the attendees planning on attending Diana's funeral.<br /><br />The focus of "The Queen," however, remains Queen Elizabeth. She gains humanity and humility as the movie progresses. She is hard as nails (the car breakdown scene is a hoot), but still feels compassion for a stag that is being hunted on the grounds. (The overbearing allegory of the stag and Diana is a bit much, though.) The prime moment of realization comes from a young girl with flowers in front of Buckingham Palace, and it also emphasizes what a splendid job Mirren did...she conveys so many emotions in just a few expressions and no words.<br /><br />Mention also should be given to Hugh Cromwell, who plays Prince Phillip as a stuffy old coot with a typical out of touch Monarch's snobbery and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Sheen shows Blair transforming from radical modernizer into a fan of the details of royalty very effectively. There is also an interesting moment near the end of the movie when Queen Elizabeth tells Blair that someday the press and the people will inevitably turn on you. While we aren't certain if that conversation ever took place, it seems deliciously prophetic none the less.</p></body></html>

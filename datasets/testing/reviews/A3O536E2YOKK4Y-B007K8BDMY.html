<meta name="summary" content="Timothy Treadwell's Last Chapter"></head><body><p>This is a very worthwhile documentary by Werner Herzog (director of the acclaimed films "Agguire, the Wrath of God" & "Fitzcarraldo") on "grizzly man" Timothy Treadwell, who actually LIVED with grizzlies for 13 summers in wilderness Alaska, often accompanied by his bear-phobic girlfriend. Treadwell comes off as a bit of a loon, yet at the same time unique, gifted, dynamic and brilliant. There are humorous and fabricated touches that cause some to wonder if this is a possible spoof or fake documentary, in the manner of "Curse of the Blair Witch," such as the hamming-it-up coronor (I'm NOT saying it is, but one occasionally wonders while viewing it).<br /><br />Treadwell documented his 13 summers with the grizzly bears on film and in journals. His journals have been made into a book by Ian Zonglobski. Each of the 13 chapters detail Treadwell's experiences with the bears, one chapter per each summer visit. The first 12 chapters reveal Treadwell's great love for the animals; to him the grizzlies are lovable cute & cuddly critters. The 13th chapter, however, horrifically details the tragic end of Timothy and his girlfriend as they end up half-eaten by a grizzly (apparently an older bear who was having a hard time finding enough to eat). This last chapter is fittingly titled "I Guess They Weren't So Cuddly After All."</p></body></html>

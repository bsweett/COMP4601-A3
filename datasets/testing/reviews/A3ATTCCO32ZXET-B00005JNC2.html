Usually I lose interest once I realize where the plot is coming from, but Garden State kept me watching through a mixture of fascination with Zach Braff's soft inscrutability and a clever mixing-up of the story elements.  This is one "Inferno" that took me by surprise.<br /><br />Zach Braff  both masterminded and starred in this film about a twentysomething guy trying to find himself on a visit home to lay his mother to rest.  Through a combination of ceaseless drug "therapy" and emotional alienation from his family, Andrew has been numb for years and can't even seem to summon up tears at the funeral.  He meets up with some old school friends and tries to console himself with the same old-same old toxic remedies of loveless sex and altered states, but somehow they have lost their effectiveness and leave him hungrier than before for something meaningful. Even worse are the series of characters that Andrew encounters throughout his home town; each one is living some kind of illusion to the point of becoming caricatures of real people. Then he finds Sam (Natalie Portman), the first person in his life who has no self-delusions.  Sam is openly flawed, funny and compassionate.  She challenges him to look for truth in everything, even his pain.  It is a turning point that leads to important revelations.<br /><br />I loved the way this film was written and paced so that Andrew's feelings of being lost and confused are infectious to me, the audience, yet it never becomes morose or dark.  This same slowness did work against it at times, but there are also some genuinely funny moments and some genuinely touching scenes. It did seem to lack a little in the way of intensity when Braff makes his self-discoveries ( I was left wondering if there wasn't more to his weirdness than the mundane reason behind all his pain). Overall though, Garden State was a well-acted and well-crafted offering for the cult-classic-to-be crowd.  Besides - who *doesn't* like Natalie Portman???<br /><br />Garden State is sure to satisfy when you are looking for something more than a summer blockbuster clich&eacute;.  Generally recommended for generations Y, X and Portman fans.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka merribelle.</p></body></html>

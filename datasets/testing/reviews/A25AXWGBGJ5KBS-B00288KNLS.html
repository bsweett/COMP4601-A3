My wife, my nearly-8-year-old son and I curled up with some popcorn after dinner, and sat back to see what this was all about.<br />From the first eerie, muted scenes, and off-kilter score, you realize you're about to take a trip to somewhere you haven't been before, and it might not be 100% pleasant.<br />I must say my son was hypnotized from the first scene. He even put down his Nintendo DS. I don't think he blinked more than twice during the whole running time.<br />The tale, about Coraline, her odd family and MORE odd "other" family, is a fractured fairy tale to be sure. There's a classicism to the story...it has a little Hansel and Gretel to it...but it's also defiantly modern in the heroine's sensibilities.<br />The plot has been outlined to death by other reviewers.<br />While the movie unspooled, my wife kept looking over to me, the look on her face of "this is kinda creepy" was unmistakable.<br />I asked my son a few times, "Are you OK? Are you scared?", and each time he replied "Yes" with a smile.<br />The animation is living, breathing,  moving art. Dear God you could stare into that (2D for me) picture and find infinite, amazing details within each room, each exterior...the garden...there's one shot that will literally take your breath away. You will actually pause your respiratory effort, so that you can absorb that gorgeous overhead shot of the garden. If you've seen the movie, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't, well, if you remember anything about this review, you'll remember THIS when you see that shot.<br />The voice acting is superb. The expressive puppetry is nothing short of miraculous. The music is intertwined with the images brilliantly.<br />I enjoyed this about as much as my son, and more than my wife, who was still pretty creeped out at the end.<br />The making-of stuff is thorough, but not overwhelming.<br />At less than sixteen bucks, this disc is a bargain and a half.</p></body></html>

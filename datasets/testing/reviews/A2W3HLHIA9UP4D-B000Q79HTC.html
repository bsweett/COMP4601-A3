<meta name="summary" content="A great-paced action film with a good story"></head><body><p>As many of you probably already know, The Bourne Identity is the first of the three installments of the Bourne film trilogy. It is loosely based on the Novel by Robert Ludlum of the same name. I had already watched this film long before I realized that it was based on a novel and that there were actually three total books involving the Bourne character, all of which would soon have their own film adaptations. With all of that said, I was initially surprised on how good this film really was. I had my doubts that Matt Damon would be able to pull off a character like Jason Bourne. For some reason, Matt Damon just doesn't come to my mind when you think action star, but he really pulled it off here. Not only Damon, but the supporting cast is good as well, with Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Julia Styles all having good performances. But what I loved about this movie was the pacing. This film has very few slow parts in it, but yet it isn't just all over-the-top action either. There's a very good balance to the film. And during the more action-packed sequences, it isn't just senseless action for the sake of action, there's a purpose behind it. The main reason for this is simply because this a good story, and it keeps the audience entertained. There's more than just one storyline happening throughout the film as you get to follow the Jason Bourne character as he tries to find out just who he really is. I really don't have many negative things to say about this film. The only thing I would change would be the last action sequence in the film involving the Bourne character jumping off a staircase and shooting someone. I really thought that was completely unrealistic. Another thing that has really nothing to do with the movie, it's about the packaging of this DVD. This is supposed the the Extended Edition with a bunch of special features. But in reality, there's not a lot of difference in this edition and the regular one. There's a few more little featurettes and an alternate beginning and ending (which I didn't care too much for), and a few little other things, but nothing real special. Heck, this isn't even a 2-disc DVD! So, if you already have this movie and not this edition, then you're not missing much. But if you're thinking about purchasing this film for the first time, I highly recommend it to any fan of not only the action genre, but anyone who just wants to see a well-paced, well written story that will keep you entertained.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Howard's Best Movie!"></head><body><p>There is something exquisite about this movie.  A gentle, understated movie that deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture but didn't get it.  It is near perfect and everyone does their part.  No grandstanding, no over the top performances but wonderful ensemble acting.  Ron Howard has never been better as a director.  No unnecessary special effects, only what is needed and the music is soft and barely noticeable, yet very necessary - where are the big egos in this movie?  Doing what is needed and nothing more.  They did a wonderful job of it and this film will live on as a classic for a long time.</p></body></html>

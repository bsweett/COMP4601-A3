<meta name="summary" content="A Gentle Tale of Lent and Chocolate"></head><body><p>This adaptation of Joanne Harris's novel lacks the seductive charm and magic of the original, but it succeeds on its own as a quiet film about a French village rife with personal crises.  When the mysterious Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), dressed in red capes, arrive in town on a day the wind from the North gusts open the church doors, interrupting the sermon on the first day of Lent, something begins to stir.  The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) knows it better than anyone.  Vianne opens a chocolaterie, serving up exotic confections designed to bring out the best in people, and relationships in the grim town shift.  Vianne seems immune to her own magic - until a band of gypsies and their leader Roux (Johnny Depp) set up camp on the edge of town.<br /><br />Director Lasse Hallstrom excels in his evocation of a small French village in 1959 and the people inhabiting it.  Despite its Swedish director, British author, and international cast, this film feels authentically French.  Its rhythms are mostly gentle, and its focus is on character rather than an intricate plot.  Juliette Binoche turns in a fine performance, even though her smile at times seems too vapid and easy for such a complicated character.  Judi Dench makes a memorable appearance as Vianne's landlady, a crotchety but spirited old woman who is estranged from her uptight daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss) and her grandson.  John Wood and Lena Olin also turn in strong supporting roles.<br /><br />Art house film addicts will want to see this, but more mainstream viewers may be bored.  Recommended for viewers who enjoy the leisurely unfolding of a quiet drama.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, But Not Great"></head><body><p>Watched this film on blu-ray last night (as the snow poured down outside.)  This was the second time,as I had seen it in the movies last September.  It is an enjoyable and exciting film, good but not great.  The problem is too many scenes go on way too long.  The opening scene in the film is suspenseful, but goes on way too long: about 20 minutes.  I felt it was too long in the movies and last night I almost immediately forwarded to scene 2.  There is one other excruciatingly long scene involving a couple of the "basterds" and a British spy meeting a German film actress and allied spy (Diane Kruger) in a bar.  This scene also goes on way too long but, at least, ends excitingly.<br />Speaking of the "basterds," they really do not play the major part in the film and are on screen rather sparingly.  For a film advertised as an action film, until the conclusion there really isn't that much action.  As for the actors, Brad Pitt has a few good scenes and his Southern accent is amusing.  However much of the film is spent with his chin out and a rather stupid expression on his face, he looks almost mentally retarded at times.  The major find in this film is Melanie Laurent, the french actress who plays the Jewish owner of the movie theater which Goebbels chooses for the premiere of his Nazi propaganda film.  This actress is not only beautiful, but gives an absolutely wonderful performance.  You cannot take your eyes off her when she is on screen, she reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn in that regard.  Diane Kruger is also excellent as the German film star, secretly spying for the allies.  And finally Christoph. Waltz, as the SS Colonel Landa, nicknamed the "Jew Hunter," gives a fantastic performance also.<br />There are numerous extras on the blu-ray including extended scenes (although many of the scenes really did not need any extensions.)  My favorite extra is a 2 part interview with Rod Taylor who has a short part as Winston Churchill.  He was one of my favorite actors growing up in the '50s and '60s, starring in 2 of my all-time favorite films: Hitchcock's "The Birds" and George Pal's production of H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine."  I especially enjoyed hearing Taylor relate how, years ago, Quentin Tarantino wrote him for an autographed picture which Tarantino still has.  I can relate to this.  I have written to Taylor on several occassions and have several very nice signed lobby cards from him, including one from "The Birds" which I have framed, hanging on my wall.  The fact that Tarantino sought Taylor out to play this small role heightens my respect for him.<br />In conclusion, this is kind of a fun fantasy to watch, if you are aware that there is more talk than action and some very long, long scenes.</p></body></html>

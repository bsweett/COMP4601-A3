<meta name="summary" content="Before you will die, you will se the Ring!"></head><body><p>What would you do if you knew you were in your last week on earth, before your death? Now normally, you don't know when death will come to you, but the characters know when they will die. And the legend happens that if you watch a video tape, you will get a phone call from a stranger, that tells you that you will die in 7 days, now how do they know if you watch the tape? When the movies opens, Katie (Amber Tamblyn), is at a cottage, with her best friend Becca (Rachael Bella), and they can't find something good to watch on TV, Becca tells her the legend of  a tape, and Katie infroms her best freind that she has already seen the tape, exactly 7 days before. Within seconds, the phone rings, and it is Katie's Mom, but before the night is over, Katie is dead, and Becca is scared by her own best freind's death. And now we meet her aunt reporter Rachel (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman), and she starts to work on the case of her niece's strange and sudden death. And she question's her niece best friends, a learns of the tape. Which leave her to the cottage that her niece was staying at the cottage that the time of her death. She chesk in at the office, and gets the same cottage, to take a nap in, before she returns home, and finds the tape in the office, takes it to the cottage, and watches the tape, and sees a girl on the tape (Daveigh Chase), and then  she gets the call, informing her "7 days". So now what she will do her final 7 days, she inlists the help of her ex-husband (Martin Henderson), on the case of  the tape. I first saw this when it played on ABC, earlier this summer, and I didn't even realzie it until I bought a copy that the movie is 1 hour and 55 minutes long. Now if you like scary movies, this should be your ticket, or stay away from the Ring.</p></body></html>

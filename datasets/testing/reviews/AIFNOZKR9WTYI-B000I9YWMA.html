<meta name="summary" content="Plagarism?!?!"></head><body><p>Kind of a mixed-up version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, wherein Johnny Depp smokes drugs and somebody else commits a crime.<br />The opening scene gives you a pretty good idea of the sort of movie this is going to be:  panning into a computer generated London abyss, we see varied scenes of filth and degradation, including a cameo by the elephant man.  I guess he was just happening by or somink.  Which brings us to the subject of Johnny Depp's accent.<br />While living in Japan I was once informed that a certain other gaijin male was a kind of laughing stock among the Japanese:  though he had learnt to speak fluent Japanese, he had apparently learnt from a woman and so he spoke fluent FEMALE Japanese.  Well, the same thing seems to have happened to Johnny Depp.<br />As to Heather Graham's accent, if I were the directors I would have taken a whip to her:  flogged her mercilessly.  Also, I would have insisted that she prepare for her role as a low-grade prostitute by working as a prostitute for some time.<br />But anyway, so Johnny Depp smokes stuff and somebody else knifes a prostitute in a dark alley.  They roust him out of the opium den in which he is languishing and take him by the scruff of the neck to get a load of a body in the morgue.  HE mumbles words to the effect that yeah, that was the broad he seen in his revery and it becomes clear that being bombed on opium is Inspector Depp's way of solving crimes.<br />The best thing to do, if you are compelled to rent - I mean buy, yes, buy - the film is to freeze-frame it on a shot of Big Ben that comes on about 40 minutes into the picture.  Just give yourself a hard copy right there and make up the rest of the movie in your imagination.</p></body></html>

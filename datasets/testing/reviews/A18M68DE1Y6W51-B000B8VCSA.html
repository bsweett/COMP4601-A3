<meta name="summary" content="As Good As the First"></head><body><p>This is a fantastic thriller, albeit a tad heavy on the car chases, but not so much that it takes away from the utter enjoyment of seeing Matt Damon reprise his role as Jason Bourne, CIA assassin-turned amnesia victim with a conscience.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Bourne and his girlfriend are living an idyllic existence off the radar on the coastline of India (beautiful photography, by the way). But Bourne has a sixth sense that he is being watched--despite his girlfriend's annoyance. And he is right. Somebody in Germany has committed a major political crime and managed somehow to leave Bourne's fingerprints at the scene. Bourne is being stalked by just about everybody, from the CIA to the FBI to the bad guys on the other side.<br /><br />As the tension builds, Damon performs brilliantly as a guy who just wants to be left alone--but whose survival skills, finely honed in another lifetime, come to the fore, complete with murder and mayhem.<br /><br />I hope Damon continues with this series. This entry was finely acted, beautifully photographed and edited, and just pure escapist fun.</p></body></html>

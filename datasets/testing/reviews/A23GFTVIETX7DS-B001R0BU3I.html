<meta name="summary" content="A Solid International Thriller That Occasionally Challenges Preconceptions"></head><body><p>Without Don Cheadle, "Traitor" would be just another international thriller about Islamic terrorists and the Americans desperate to thwart them.  Cheadle's Samir Horn, a conflicted man born in Sudan but now an American, manages to quietly charm and thus challenge preconceived notions of what it means to be a Muslim, what it means to be a terrorist, what it means to care so deeply about an issue that you are willing to risk everything, and what it means to assume you know what lies underneath.  That Cheadle can convey all this in an otherwise impassive expression is impressive.<br /><br />The film opens first with Samir as a boy witnessing his father's death in a car bomb, and then with him as an adult in the midst of a secret arms deal in Yemen interrupted by a surprise police raid.  When Samir earns the respect of fellow Muslim convicts, the film starts down the labyrinth of terrorist cells, motives, and subterfuge, followed step by step by two eager FBI agents (Guy Pearce, memorable as Agent Clayton, and Neal McDonough).<br /><br />When the film started, I was worried that it would play into all the stereotypes that put Muslims into a neat box labeled "terrorists," but Samir's girlfriend, whom he leaves behind, is an intelligent professional outraged  that the man she loves has dirtied the name of their faith.  And even some of the terrorists have doubts about what they are doing.  The behavior of the Americans isn't always ethical, either.  At the core of the movie, however, are two men, Samir and Clayton, who believe deeply in the line between right and wrong and who rely on their separate faiths.  Cheadle is more memorable in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R4T3U">Hotel Rwanda</a>, and Pearce more memorable (ha!) in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">Memento</a>, but both do admirable jobs in this film.<br /><br />Seasoned film goers will see the major twist long before it is revealed, but fortunately other, smaller surprises keep the plot interesting.  Although not the best thriller I've seen, Traitor is a solid, intriguing entry into the genre.</p></body></html>

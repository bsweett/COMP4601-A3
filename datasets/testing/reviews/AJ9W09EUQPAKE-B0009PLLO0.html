Nothing like the vicious and virtuous and God-like ambitious Alexander the Great. $300. Is that what this mess really cost? No, when these types of big budget movies work, like Gladiator, they are great. When they fail, they leave one almighty trail of waste that leaves the viewer thinking - why?<br /><br />Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother! Give us a break - she looks younger than he does in the film.<br /><br />An overblown campfest that leaves a very poor taste.</p></body></html>

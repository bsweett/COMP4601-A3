<meta name="summary" content="Good Cast Damaged by Sprawling Story: Still Depp Is Splendid"></head><body><p>Maybe you read here or somewhere else that &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; featurs Antonio Banderas as its star.  No, wrong.  It's real star is Johnny Depp, who steals the show in every scene he is in.  In fact, you really wish that director Robert Rodriguez chopped the overlong film again, collected the Depp parts  only, and re-edited it to make it far better than now.<p>The convoluting story defies our summery, so let it be short.  Antonio Banderas character is recruited by force to help the assasination of the Mexican president.  The mastermind of the plan is General Marquez, but the trouble is, a CIA guy (cool and ruthless Depp) is also behind it, having its own plan to accomplish.<p>I know screenplay writing is not what made the name of Robert Rodriguez.  Still, the last of trilogy beginning from &quot;El Mariachi&quot; is getting more and more sprawling, damaging the imapct of the entire film.  I like his gadgets; I like his style of gun-shooting; but this time he overeaches himself, intent on violence done without his grace.<p>But the most unforgivable thing is the way of using Salma Hayek.  You see her name on the second place of the credit.  But the time allotted to her is so short that her appearance is slightly better than cameo (and see the poster if you have a chance, which suggests her role is more substantial than it really is).  This is simply outrageous, and surely invites the criticism of being dishonest.<p>The cast is quite unique, making a list of character actors -- Willem Defoe, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, and even Mickey Rourke -- but the confusing story kills any opportunities for them to impress us.  And Banderas is not particularly good, looking as if he does not know what he really wants to do.<p>See this one as another showcase for Johnny Depp's talent.  Only his role is interesting, and the final chapter is virtually made for him, in which he has to fight under the most disadvantageous condition (see for yourself).  In that moment only, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; regains the thrilling moments as we once witnessed in &quot;El Mariachi.&quot;</p></body></html>

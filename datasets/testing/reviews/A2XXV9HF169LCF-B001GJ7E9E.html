<meta name="summary" content="Old-fashion high class fluff"></head><body><p>This movie reminded me of all the old black and white dance-and-banter movies I used to watch, with loads of style and deadpan wit, and a good coating of gloss. There isn't much substance-this isn't the sort of movie to go in depth- but there's some really surprisingly good acting. Brad Pitt is a down to earth, old fashioned skills sort of killer; Angelina Jolie is slick, high-strung, part of a big-money-and-loads of neat toys assasination outfit. They do a brilliant job. I really enjoyed it. There's an attention to detail in some aspects that my friend the gun enthusiast would get a kick out of. (Those yellow sunglasses actually have a purpose in top-level competitive shooting; they make your vision ever so slightly better.)<br /><br />My husband and I - both former military - watched it in the theater with a bunch of teenagers, and I think we laughed so hard we embarased them. It's really a good movie, it works on the blow-em-up level as well as a slightly more sophisticated one.</p></body></html>

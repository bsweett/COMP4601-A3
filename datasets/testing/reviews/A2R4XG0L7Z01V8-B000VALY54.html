<meta name="summary" content=""Do not play detective. This is not a book. This is not a movie.""></head><body><p>If you've never seen a Robert Downey Jr. movie in your life, this is the film to pick up and watch. Now. Without fail. If what you really know about Robert is what you've read in the press about his addictions, then you need to educate yourself. I needed to be educated. I was. Here I am, four star review.<br /><br />The film starts off with a thief, Harry, running from the police, and landing himself in an audition. He cries, he gets the role. Bang. (Or bang bang, if you will.) He gets invited to a random party, meets a gay private investigator, played brilliantly by Val Kilmer, and meets the girl of his dreams from a few years ago. Dead bodies appear, and they must find the clues, and solve the murders before it's them up next.<br /><br />But Harry is also narrating the movie. He can pause the film and fill you in on the background, remind you about something that happened previously in the film, or hilariously rewind the movie. (So funny.)<br /><br />The one liners in this movie are hilarious. Basically every line that comes from Robert & Val's lips are nearly always funny. This film has everything else a murder mystery lacks - a sense of humour. And Robert of course. There's lots of trademarks in this - death, trashy clubs, sex, the beautiful blonde, wrapped up corpses, crazy clues, and lots and lots of twists.<br /><br />Every male watching this as probably aspired to be someone as cool as Harry at some point in their life. He's cool, he's a 'good' criminal, and he makes the audience root for him. Paired up against Perry, the gay PI, every scene will raise a smile (if not something else!), and the two actors have perfect chemistry together, and they probably had a laugh off screen as well as on.<br /><br />I won't spoil the movie any more for anyone who hasn't seen it, but for god's sake pick it up! It's definitely one I'll be looking out for, cheap, as the one liners are quick and witty, and the actors are amazing in it. Also, it'll be good if I can figure out (and remember) the twists and turns before they come this time. But pick it up. Robert is actually an actor, not just press fodder.</p></body></html>

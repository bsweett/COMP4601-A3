<meta name="summary" content="Ever wondered why there were monsters under your bed?"></head><body><p>"Monsters Inc" gives one explanation.  You see, in a city called Monstropolous, their electrical power is generated by kid's screams. The monsters are actually more afraid of the children than the children are of the monsters.<br /><br />And that, folks, is the problem.<br /><br />As kids get more and more sophisticated, it's harder to scare them.  Monsters are working hard to make sure they have the power to keep their city running.  Sully (John Goodman) and his buddy Mike (Billy Crystal) are top-runners for the Scare Record, but they have stiff competition.<br /><br />Then, somehow, a kid gets loose in Monstropolous.  Sully and Mike take charge of her, but can they get her back to her home without being found out---or having her harmed?<br /><br />"Monsters INc" is a fun romp full of cute and engaging characters.  Definitely a must for collections of kid films of all ages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The First & StillThe Best King Kong"></head><body><p>With the recent re-make of this film, I hope more people take the opportunity to check this movie out, the original King Kong, if they've never seen it.<br /><br />This movie must have been astounding to the people watching it over 70 years ago. I doubt they'd ever seen anything like this, action-wise, and monster-wise. It is still fascinating today, even with the great advancements in special effects.<br /><br />Most action films from the classic years, from 1920 to the late 1960s had corny mostly unrealistic special effects but this film still holds up, extraordinarily so considering its age. The film also had a tremendous amount of action. People today are usually bored watching old black-and-white movies but they wouldn't be bored with this one. Once the "girl," Fay Wray gets captured by King Kong, the rest of the movie is one long action scene.....but not way overdone as the 2005 version was.<br /><br />Two re-makes and this old, old film still is the best King Kong. Amazing!</p></body></html>

What impressed me this time is the beautiful agent Maggie Q, whose moves are fluid and crisp, and Michelle Monaghan as Agent Ethan's new-wedded wife, Julia. The final sequences when Julia looked at the battered Ethan, pulled the trigger and later saved Ethan were beautifully captured. There was more to it than pure action - love was in the air. A twist as to who is the mole is also a pleasant surprise.</p></body></html>

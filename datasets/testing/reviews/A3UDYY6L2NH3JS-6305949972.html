<meta name="summary" content="Christmas is better than Halloween, but Halloween is best"></head><body><p>A film of great interest, artistically. It is a Christmas pantomime that reveals a very high level of technical perfection in  animation. It is a very good musical where music and singing are literally merged into the pictures. It is also a very profound film about children : their expectation of fear with Halloween and of joy with Christmas. Children are just like adults, dark on one side and colorful on the other side, and they don't want the two to be mixed or just to mix. This gives a great attractive power to the film for these children who will be panickstricken by the kidnapping and possible killing of Santa Claus, and who will be thrilled by the frightening characters that haunt our vision of Halloween and this strange night when ghosts come back to roam our streets begging for candy. A classic for children and a piece of artistic pleasure for adults.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

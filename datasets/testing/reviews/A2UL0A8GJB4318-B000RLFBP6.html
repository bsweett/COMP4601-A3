<meta name="summary" content="Brutal and Scathing Sci-Fi"></head><body><p>Before "Robocop" displays its extreme violence in a parade of bullets and blood, it opens with a newsbreak that details a world on the verge of disaster and a city out of control, Detroit.  While the world deals with Star Wars, impending Nucleur doom and war, Detroit deals with drugs, rampant violent crime and corporate scum who control the police, hospital system and prisons.  The one bit of actual integrity is the police, who still go out on the streets to try to find some order in the choas.<p>Now, "Robocop" is never as serious as I put on.  That newsbreak and corporate scum is scathing satire that prevails throughout the film on 1980s' America, hitting close to home.  Everything is privitized, the world on the edge of disaster and America riddled in crime and decadence.  Man in the future isn't pretty.<p>The police however, are trying to do some good in this world.  One of their men, Murphy (Peter Weller) ends up being shot to pieces by crime boss Clarence Bodiger (Kurtwood Smith) and his cohorts in one of films' most graphic sequences.  But Murphy returns, sort of, as Robcop, one of the company OCPs' projects to try to clean up crime (but only for a company project called Delta City).  Murphy, however, is still holding some of his shattered humanity, and when he learns of who exactly killed him, he goes on a revenge mission to find them.  He encouters Bodiger and his cohorts in a cocaine plant and an old abadoned steel mill, each attempts to kill each other.  <p>Besides that satire, director Paul Verhoeven is the films' insatiable and bloody energy, showing his fetish proudly for lots and lots of bloodshed.  But editor Frank Urioste and cinematographer Jost Vocano are the bulk of the reason why "Robocop" is a fluid, fast-paced action flick.  And writers Ed Neumier (who also signed on as executive producer) and Michael Miner make "Roocop" an intelligent and pessimistic view of the future.</p></body></html>

Any number of films have benefited from this type of &quot;remake&quot;. Just as many, though, have had little added. In effect being able to go back and re-edit a film as allowed artistic second guessing. Sometimes it's to the disadvantage of a classic.<p>Crowe's &quot;bootleg&quot; version of Almost Famous (released under it's original title &quot;Untitled&quot;) kind of falls between these two camps as nothing essential is really added back to the film. A pity this wasn't released like this previously as the running commentary between Crowe and his Mom is actually interesting.<p>Still, kudos to Crowe (and the marketing folks at Dreamworks)for the way this package is put together. The CD of unreleased songs and having both versions of the film make this an interesting boxed set. A pity that Apocalypse Now Redux wasn't released in this format (there's a good example of a film that would benefit this type of packaging. It would have allowed the inclusion of the original film, the re-edited version --in the slightly different aspect ratio--along with the stunning documentary Hearts of Darkness by Coppola's wife).<p>SInce music is so essential to all of Crowe's films I can't help but wonder what he will do as a film director/writer once he finishes mining the past. What happens when he hits his midlife crisis? Who know what artistic explorations might be in store...</p></body></html>

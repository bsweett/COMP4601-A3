<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>I saw this movie without really any expectations and was completely taken away by how great this movie really was.  It's one of the best films I've seen that really show the feelings between father and daughter, husband and wife, boss and employee...it was just all around a great, feel good film.  It really did make me smile.  I'm not sure what oscar season it would fall into, last years (which would be a shame) or this years but I would hope to see Quaid and Grace up for oscars, moreso Quaid than any.  I've always felt Dennis was a great actor, but this I feel was a turning point in his career...it proved to me that he is a talent to take VERY seriously.  Great job, and I'm pulling for you come oscar season.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good script"></head><body><p>I went to see a preview last night and I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent script (which is rare these days) and an exciting movie with many twists and turns. Michael Douglas and Keifer Sutherland are excellent in their parts. The ladies in the movie were their for their looks like Eva Longoria for example and the acting was so so on their part.</p></body></html>

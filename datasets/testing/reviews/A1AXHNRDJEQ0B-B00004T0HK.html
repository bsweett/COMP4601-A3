<meta name="summary" content="Good movie despite some flaws..."></head><body><p>While bringing up an important lessons about the wringness on neo Nazism & white supremacy, the over 'touchy feely'' and 'we're here to teach you a lesson'attitude of the film, using your standard Hollywood techniques (such as black & white flashbacks) was a little offputting.<br /><br />On the other hand, the performances (especially by Edward Norton), the direction & the storytelling made up for it quite well.<br /><br />The story starts in the present - Danny Vineyard (Edward Furlong) is in trouble at school again, because he wrote an assignment that sheds heroic light on Adolf Hitler. While his history teacher (a Jew who we later learn had dated Danny's mother, but was driven off by the rest of the family's attitude) would like to see him expelled for good, the school principal (who happens to be black) would like to give him another chance - and gives him an assignment - to write a paper on the effect his older brother has had on his life.<br /><br />The older brother, Derek (Edward Norton) has been a bright kid, but turned into a 'skin head' neo nazi at a certain point in highschool - and things just got worse & worse until Derek has been incarcerated for killing a black man who tried stealing his car. Being charismatic, he's the most dominant member of his neo nazi gang - led by an older man (Stacy Keach) who doesn't like to get his hands dirty, so he lets the boys (led by Derek) to do it for him. Danny is also affected by Derek's rhetoric, and turns into a skin head himself when Derek isn't home.<br /><br />While writing his assignment, Danny flashes back into the family's history, trying to undertand why his older brother went for the white supremacy rhetoric in the first place, and hears his brother's "change of heart in jail" story (that may be a little too graphic), when trying to save his little brother from a fate he now understand is wrong.</p></body></html>

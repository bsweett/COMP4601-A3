<meta name="summary" content="Landmark in Early American Filmmaking"></head><body><p>An original thought:  Carl Denham(Robert Armstrong), shameless huckster that he is who risks the lives of the unwitting for his own personal glory, should have took the bullets instead of Kong.  Instead, he gets to mouth empty platitudes about beauty killing the beast over poor exploited Kong's dead body.  The cops should have slapped the cuffs on him for putting the general public in harm's way.  Now that I've got that off my chest I can extoll the virtues of "King Kong".  This film is not only a technological marvel but an exciting edge of your seat adventure film.  This is a slam dunk with the convergence of great storytelling and excellent technical craftmanship adding up to a timeless masterpiece.  The creatures designed for this film by Willis O'Brien are so expressive and lifelike that they have more character than the human actors.  I'm hoping that Peter Jackson's upcoming remake has a fraction of the original's inventiveness.</p></body></html>

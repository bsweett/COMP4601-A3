<meta name="summary" content="An Absolutely Perfect DVD"></head><body><p>That King Kong is an undisputable classic that not only unshered in a whole new era of special effects and has influenced EVERYONE since (ask George Lucas and Jim Cameron, for two), but is also timeless as a classic in and of itself is a given for anyone who knows anything about movies, so why even get into that?<br /><br />What makes this DVD a complete gem is that the presentation is absolutely flawless. The film itself is complete and razor-sharp; It looks as if would had they found a pristine never-shown print somewhere.<br /><br />The extras are simply tremendous, and completely fascinating without ever being idol worship or techno-boring. It answers every question you've ever had about KK, and probably a few that never occurred. The spider pit sequence is absolutely incredible on several levels, the test footage is very cool, and the documentary on Cooper himself is interesting.<br />And the inclusions are very cool, too. If you consider yourself a film fan, buy this right now. It's an absolute must.<br /><br />This is how all classic films deserve to be treated on DVD!</p></body></html>

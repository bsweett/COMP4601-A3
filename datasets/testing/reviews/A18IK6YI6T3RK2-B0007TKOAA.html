It's totally offbeat, but so well done.  Giamatti, is first rate as always and Church is his perfect foil.  It's a touching film and you really pull for Giamatti's character, you so want him to find some happiness, I can't think of any actor working today that is better at these type of parts than Giamatti.  This film really is a true comedy drama, parts of it are just hilarious, but parts are so raw you want to look away..really a very good film.  If you appreciate top notch acting and quality film work, then you will like this film, pop the DVD in and stick with it, you will be drawn in.</p></body></html>

Yep, it surely is...although I must admit, I do have a soft spot in my heart for this big budget flop-o-ramas, especially ones starring academy awards winning actors/actresses.  The caramel nougat center of this movie is the core of the Earth has stopped spinning, causing problems in the magnetic field that surrounds the Earth, keeping the dangerous microwave and other bits of space radiation at bay.  What caused the core of the Earth to stop spinning?  Who knows?  But I bet it was something we did...it's always something we did because if there is anything I've learned from Hollywood, it's that humans are a self destructive lot, and we're not happy unless we're cutting down trees, pollutin' the oceans, or tearing up the ozone.<br /><br />Anyway, in a plot mostly lifted from a slightly less crummy movie (Armageddon), a special team of scientists is assembled to travel in a specialized ship, made of (get this) Unobtanium, to the center of the Earth and jump-start the now stalled core using nuclear weapons.  At a certain point in the movie (like five minutes in), you will have to turn the logical part of your brain off to be able to keep watching, as there are plot holes bigger than a house throughout the film.  I'm no geology whiz or an expert on physics as such, but I can tell when someone's trying to feed me a humungous, steaming pile of droppings, even if it's on a silver spoon, the silver spoon being all the high tech special effects, which looked good at first, but then became sort of cartoonish after awhile.<br /><br />It's funny how a bad movie can turn almost anyone into a fortuneteller.  By about an hour into the movie, I was able to correctly guess who was going to live and who was going to die within the crew with such accuracy that I was tempted to go out and buy a lottery ticket.  Equally amazing was how I was able to almost predict the order and manner in which the deaths occurred.  After determining that I have no divine powers of prognostication, I aptly realized that the script was actually telegraphing all the information needed to come to the conclusions that I did.  If you are unable to discern who will bite it and who will survive, it's only because you've probably lost interest in the movie or are laughing so hard at all its' flaws and gaping holes that you missed said elements.  I mean really, the only way it could have been made more obvious was if a neon sign appeared next to the character saying, "I'm going to die."<br /><br />So what happens?  Is the Earth saved?  Who survives?  Who dies?  Who cares...seriously, I felt all the actors did adequately well, but this turkey would have required nothing short of the hand of God for salvation.  My favorite scene, which isn't in the movie, was located in the Deleted Scenes section of the disc.  It involved the scientists witnessing a demonstration of a device that uses ultrasonic waves to pulverize rock.  The device, being rather small, made a pencil size hole in a rock, followed by a poof of smoke.  The one arrogant scientist then made a sarcastic statement about having to wear protective equipment for such a catastrophic event.  The character I liked the least was Rat, played by DJ Qualls.  He was the hacker supreme tasked with controlling all information regarding the catastrophic events caused by the loss of rotation of the Earths' core.  Your classical nerdy computer geek, he often referred to his skills as a hacker as his 'kung-fu', making such inane statements like, "My kung-fu is strong."  These attempts to make him an endearing character made me cringe, mostly because the movie offered little evidence that he was as good as he was supposed to be, creating programs and hacking sites and basically controlling information flow on the worldwide internet with relative ease.  A few keystrokes and he could access security of the highest levels.  If the Internet is as unsecured as it is in this movie, then we're all screwed.  Overall, while I understand these types of movies usually require a certain level of suspension of disbelief, this film asks way too much of its' viewers in that manner.  This movie is listed as a drama/sci-fi/action/thriller but really it's a fantasy.  If you keep that in mind going into this movie, you may derive more enjoyment out of it than I did, but I doubt it as it's derivate plot, clich&eacute;s and total lack of scientific credibility are so painfully obvious and the whole thing is just so damn predictable.  The mantra in making this movie seems to have been 'If you can't intelligently work out a plot detail, just make something up'.<br /><br />I do acknowledge that this film has the appearance of a more traditional movie, but seeing as how this is the 21st century, using certain methods used in the past to work through the plot doesn't hold water as it did in the past.  As our general knowledge increases through the myriad of outlets now available, we are generally more informed, and less likely to accept implausibilties as we were in the past in contemporary work such as this.</p></body></html>

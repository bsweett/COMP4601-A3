<meta name="summary" content="Stallone is a legend..."></head><body><p>This movie is awesome. For the average action movie fan, you'll enjoy the movie, for true Rambo fans, you'll be drooling. It is that good!<br /><br />Stallone thoroughly pulls off the part, do not listen to the critics. He still makes you fear and respect John Rambo.<br /><br />One of the smartest aspects of this movie, is that they added a group of side characters (mercenaries, snipers) that fill in the story well!<br /><br />You wont be disappointed with RAMBO!</p></body></html>

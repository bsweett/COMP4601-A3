<meta name="summary" content="Second Favorite of DH1, 2 and 3"></head><body><p>This is a review of Die Hard 1, 2 and 3. My favorite would be DH2, but DH1 really set the mold and probably should win the award for best creativity. I prefer the winter airport and snowmobile scenes of DH2 to the city skyscraper scenes of DH1 &#65533; it probably has a significant amount to do with where you grew up. Probably the same for the underground scenes of DH3, although I think DH3 was less well done from many perspectives (plot, acting, cinematography, sound). Through all of them, though, one cannot help but cheer on the good guy and be thrilled when he pulls another one off. Get all three and watch them some relaxing night.</p></body></html>

I'm not sure if I buy the whole Jesus bloodline thing, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of this well made film.  Tom Hanks does his usual good job, and is supported by a fine cast of players.  The film is layered nicely as one clue leads to another with a twist and turn here and there to keep you guessing.  The religious implications aside, this is a good movie that makes you think.  After seeing the film, I would say to go pick up the book which expands greatly on the story.</p></body></html>

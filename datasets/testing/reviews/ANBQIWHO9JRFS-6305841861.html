Lotsa people like to throw around the term horror-comedy when describing this, but I don't think that's quite appropriate.  While it uses a horror setting, it virtually never seems to be trying to work on a horror movie level, so I'm not really comfortable using the term horror in the description.  On the other hand, calling it a spoof or parody doesn't really decribe it either, as too much of the humor seems to be unrelated to the horror setting.  But, all that aside this is a pretty funny movie, and a rather 'cool' movie as well, for lack of a better term.<p>Unlike everyone else in the world, this is not my favorite of the series.  In fact, it's my least favorite.  However, it still stands up quite well, and is definitely worth your time.  Despite the fact that it shares the setting of the original, this one has far more in common with Army of Darkness then the original, as it focuses on fast-moving and ridiculous comedic setups.  It's largely a means for Campbell to do physical comedy and ham it up amusingly, and showcase lots of intentionally dated, but still cool special effects.  Sadly, Ash isn't quite as amusing as he'd become in the next film.  He's not nearly as angry/surly as he'd become, which I always thought was more important to humor of the film than the physical comedy. But he's still pretty damn amusing.  Raimi's visual flair is as good here as ever.  The 'force' shots are much improved from the already superb ones in the original.  The famed scene of it endlessly chasing Ash around the cabin is especially noteworthy.  He also does some nice stuff with the sky as well, particuarly a great shot of Ash in front of a ridiculously enormous sun.  <p>The film starts off with a simplified recap of the first film, concluding with Ash's burial of Linda and his being assaulted by 'the force'. The briefly possessed Ash is exorcised by the rising sun, but the bridge is still out, and there is no other apparent means of escape, so he is forced to wait it out in the cabin.  The first half of the movie, before the other characters arrive, is the better part.  Most of the stuff involving Linda is quite amusing, particularly her stop-motion animated dancing out in the moonlight.  The best part, however, has to be the scene where Linda's decapitated head attacks Ash.  It's simple, mindless physical comedy, but his frantically running around trying to smash it off is just great. Probably the best scene in the film. I'm also especially found of how the head just spontaneously falls on him from above, without any explanation of how it could've gotten in the cabin, or up above his head, for that matter.  The stuff with his evil and later severed hand is quite amusing too.  The fact that it is inexplicably talking all the time is the real kicker to the whole set-up.  The laughing house scene is quite cool as well, particuarly the disturbing deer head.  It's not really funny or scary or exciting, but it's very, very weird, and works quite well.  <p>The arrival of the other characters hurts the film a bit, partially because I find some of them to be rather annoying.(Most notably Jake, and, to a lesser extent, his girlfried, Bobbie Joe.)  Of course, I think he's meant to be a bit irritating, but that doesn't really make him much more enjoyable to watch.  Fortunately, he's largely redeemed by an extremely amusing death scene.  <p>Despite not being quite as consistent or energetic as the first half, the second half still delivers.  The fight with Evil Ed is a nice sendup of Shelley's death from the first film, and the final confrontation with Henrietta is delightful.(Film makers really need to use stop-motion animation more often these days)  The fight with the rotten apple head isn't quite as good of a climax as I'd have liked, but it's still pretty decent, and does a good job of raising the stakes in terms of sheer ridiculousness.(particularly when Ash plunges his chainsaw into the creatures eye, and it sprays out hideous blue blood)<p>A few closing notes.  First of all, as others have mentioned, although the DVD comes with both widescreen and fullscreen, the widescreen version just appears to have the top and bottom matted. (i.e. you see less in the widescreen version, not more) Since the Anchor Bay release comes with both it's not much of a concern, but it's good to know.  Secondly, this movie has a reputation for being very gory, which is not exactly deserved.  It's just too ridiculous to even be desribed as being gory in the conventional sense, as it generally uses ultra fake blood that isn't even red,(with either incredibly thick or incredibly water texture) and silly, incredibly plastery limbs.(That, and there just isn't all that much gore in it anyway) To say this is very gory is like saying that old Warner Brothers cartoons are very violent. You're technically correct, but you probably give completely the wrong impression to someone who's never seen the piece your talking about.<p>Anyways, this is good. Check it out.</p></body></html>

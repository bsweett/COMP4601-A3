<meta name="summary" content="Good actors save movie"></head><body><p>The cast of The Interpreter obviously saves this movie. Although the plot is intelligent enough, no way this movie would have been an outstanding success without the acting capabilities of Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman!<br />After Interpreter Kidman overhears some information she shouldn't have the rising tension is being displayed very well. However there is a very remarkable fact in this movie, that doesn't make any sense. Why isn't Kidman's part played by a black actress? Having white Kidman speak a native African language like this Ku is absolutely ridiculous! What was going through Sydney Pollack's mind when he had Nicole Kidman say lines like: "I'm going back to my people in Africa!"? (SARR)</p></body></html>

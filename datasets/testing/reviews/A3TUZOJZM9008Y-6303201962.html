<meta name="summary" content="The perfect Trek film."></head><body><p>The even movies in this series are the &quot;real&quot; Trek movies. ST4 had the whales. ST6 had the last of the old crew. ST8 had the Borg, ST10 had the Romulans and a clone. But ST2, ah ST2, that had Ricardo Mantalban giving William Shatner's scene chewing a run for it's money.<p>In fact, Shatner is relatively subdued for the better part of the movie. His Captain Kirk is feeling his age and faced with an estranged son that would prefer to remain estranged. Lost love and missed opportunities, and a tight reign from director Nicholas Meyer (Time After Time, ST6), help keep Shatner in check.<p>Also marks the screen debut of Kirstie Alley as Lt. Saavik.<p>The DVD package is put together very well. Once Paramount decided to start doing a good job with DVD special editions. They took it all the way to the bank.</p></body></html>

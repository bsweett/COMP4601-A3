<meta name="summary" content=""Dead Man's Chest" keeps the franchise rocking the Seven Seas"></head><body><p>Take your logic, your intellect, and your cynicism and chuck it over the side - the "Pirates" franchise is back and bigger than ever with "Dead Man's Chest."  And that's a darn good thing.<br /><br />This is a series that knows what it is - popcorn fodder extraordinaire.  I could try to recap the plot for you, but there are so many twists, turns, and subplots that I'd quickly run out of space. Suffice it to say that this is "Curse of the Black Pearl," only turned up to 11.<br /><br />What does it say about a flick when Stellen Skarsgard and Bill Nighy can play characters that resemble aquatic genetic mutations crossed with a zombie and still say that they get completely upstaged by another monster, the Kraken?  "Dead Man's Chest" is action, but with a brain and a wondrous imagination.  Too many sequels are extended reprises of the original, including dubious self-references to the first film.  While there is some of that here, most of it is done lightly and with tongue firmly in cheek - you can't help but grin when Jack Sparrow quickly mutters "Hide the rum" when encountering Keira Knightley's Elizabeth again.<br /><br />And ultimately Depp makes this movie, just as he did the first go-round.  Sure, he's surrounded by some excellent actors and special effects, but Depp carries this franchise as few have been carried - with a drunken stumble and a hilarious leer.  God only knows if Depp really hates or loves playing Sparrow, but he surely plays him with the same zeal that Mike Meyers brings to Austin Powers/Dr. Evil or that Jim Carrey brings to Ace Ventura - this is a character for the ages.<br /><br />Family-friendly but definitely scary at times when the Kraken shows up, "DMC" is a worthy second act in a three-act series - "At World's End" is teed up about as well as a next installment could ever hope to be.</p></body></html>

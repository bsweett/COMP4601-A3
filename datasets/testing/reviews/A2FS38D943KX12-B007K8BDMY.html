<meta name="summary" content="An examination of Treadwall which is as unsentimental as nature itself"></head><body><p>I would take issue with reviewers who characterize Herzog as being generally sympathetic with Timothy Treadwell.  I believe that Herzog regards Treadwell in much the same way he regards Klaus Kinski --- remarkable in one sense, but ultimately an impossible human being.  Herzog's veiled references to Kinski (during Treadwell's extended, profanity-filled rant about the Park Service) are hard to miss if one knows the background.  Herzog admires Treadwell as a film-maker, one craftsman to another, and there is no denying that much of Treadwell's footage is quite remarkable.  However, it takes a rather skewed perspective to believe that Herzog has taken up Treadwell's banner in any sense.<br /><br />Herzog makes clear that his view of nature differs sharply from the fantasy-land notion of nature that Treadwell constructed in his mind.  It is one of the few occasions that Herzog goes on record as specifically disagreeing with Treadwell, but Herzog's choice of footage allows Treadwell, through word & deed, largely to damn himself.  It should obvious to almost everyone that anthropomorphizing bears & foxes really isn't a very good idea at all, on multiple levels.  Treadwell's almost-disbelieving response when he finds animals killed, not by the poachers he was convinced were hidden in every copse, but by other animals, makes it pretty evident that his view of Benign Nature was largely divorced from reality.<br /><br />Herzog also observes that while Treadwell may have been dwelling in some type of Make-Believe Nature World, he was nonetheless quite canny and aware of the image he had carefully constructed and contained.  The conspicuous absence of the assorted girlfriends who accompanied him, as well as the multiple well-rehearsed takes and framing of shots, shows a man who had a very clear idea of what he was doing...at least on one level.<br /><br />Ultimately, what this film left me with was Herzog's examination of ego run amok, leading ultimately to a self-ordained destruction.  To me, Treadwell never seemed to approach fulfillment or anything approaching happiness, and don't think Herzog sees this in Treadwell either.  One is left then with an ego-driven belief in one's own importance and imperviousness, and where can that lead but hubris?  Even without knowing the background of Treadwell's story, one is certain from the first frame that Treadwell is screwed big time.  It isn't a question of things ending up badly; we've seen this before from Herzog.  It is the journey to the ultimate disaster which interests him.</p></body></html>

I believe the quality of the special effects were excellent and the story very good as well. The transfer quality of the Blu-Ray DVD was one of the best I have ever watched and helped make this movie special for me since my first viewing of this film was on my large screen home theater.<br /><br />I am surprised that this film scored such a flat 3 star rating but the statistics are what they are. These statistics probably reflect as much about us, the audience growing old watching Indiana Jones films as the movie makers.  All in all, I think it was a very good effort and within my small group of movie going friends I know this film was well thought of and provided a very entertaining evening.</p></body></html>

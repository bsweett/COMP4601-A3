<meta name="summary" content="The Precipice of Change"></head><body><p>My rating:  3.5 out of 5<br /><br />Premise<br />*A loose remake of the 1951 film; a UFO lands in Manhattan and an alien named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) appears, who is promptly shot by the military.  One thing leads to another, and Klaatu determines that humans must be destroyed in order to save the Earth.<br /><br />The Good Things<br />*Video/sound quality is perfect.<br />*Includes a commentary, some picture-in-picture features, some feaurettes, deleted scenes, trailers, a feature that lets you build your own robot, a digital copy, and a bare-bones version of the 1951 film in high-definition (which in itself is like a 4.5 out of 5 star movie).<br />*The movie has some extremely excellent special effects and some cool action scenes.<br />*Photography is excellent.  The visual style is good.<br />*Production design (props, costumes, sets, etc) is excellent.<br />*The movie bears some resemblances to the original; many of the same locales (like Arlington Cemetary) are used, GORT looks the same (only bigger, and made of nanites), similar characters, and so on.  This film also expands on certain areas; Klaatu has more omnipotent powers, there's much more military involvement, etc.<br />*Characters are not bad, for the most part.  Acting is good (even though Keanu Reeves is rather monotonous, it fits his character.  Only the little boy irritated me).<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*I hated the kid's character; he acted irrationally and hatefully, and I found it hard to understand him.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The story is not bad in general, but the second half of the movie does become predictable and contrived.  I didn't mind myself, but others may be severely dissapointed.<br />*The story's message is different from the original film, gearing towards environmentalism.  some folks seem to hate it, citing it as too obvious or contrived, or too weak compared to the original film, but I didn't mind.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm going to be dinged for posting a positive review on a movie that everybody seems to hate.  But frankly, I don't think this movie is all THAT bad; it just sucks when compared to the original, which had better writing, stronger themes, and classier photography.  But ultimately, it was a product of the 1950s, whereas this remake is the product of the late 2000s; both are representative of their eras.  The old version was simple, classy, and intelligent; the new one is loaded with style and action.  I found it quite entertaining, and a bit worthwhile on its own merits.  But, most people would disagree.  If you're really really interested, perhaps you should rent it first.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Instead of starting to bash Michael Moore, let's first sit and think for ourselves."></head><body><p>This Michael Moore film covers the below topics.<br /><br />(1) American Health care system critized to be a profitable enterprise setup by politicians for the benifit of politicians,Health insurance companies, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. It paints the  picture of this nexus between all of the above and defrauding the American people.<br /><br />(2) The support for social medicine or universal health care sponsored by government.<br /><br />(3) The portrayal of health care systems of Canada, UK,France and Cuba in good light while that of USA in a very poor light.<br /><br />(4) Paints the picture of the corporate greed of the medical insurance companies as against the better medical and health care system of the above mentioned countries.<br /><br />(5) We see interviews by patients or loved one of patients who died because those patients could not receive swift emergency medical care in time due to the hospitals not accepting the patients due to  their ineligibility of their health insurance<br />  plan to receive such a service, the denial of medication, or specialist doctor consultatation referral, or denial of specific operations that could have  helped save lives. We see of the insider whistle blowers of medical inusrance companies who talk about how it works inside. Claims agents get a better bonus based on how successful they were in  turning  down claims, the highest bonus being paid to he/she who denies the most claims and hence saving the company the most of the money<br /><br />(5) Takes a dig at US health care portraying Guantanemo Bay - medical facitlities to be the only place under US soil where universal health care is available.<br /><br />(6) Interview with french locals who talk about 5 weeks paid leave, maternity assistance by government, free hospitalisation and medical treatment and the stark contrast to that over here in USA riddled with this copay, deductions, hefty premiums<br />  and then denials of claims for genuine cases.<br /><br />(7) Norway where prisoners have spas and the maximum sentence is 21 years.<br /><br />(8) advocates support for socialised medicine, and de-privatisation of  the health care industry and putting it into the hands of the government. Advocates support for bill HR 676.<br /><br />Michael Moore asks a sincere question: why should the world's most powerful nation and one of the world's strongest economies have such a lousy and inferior health care system which has scant regard for it's citizen's welfare and greater regard for the profitable insurance companies. If nothing else this docuemntary makes us thing, so instead of starting to bash Michael Moore (CNN has bashed him enough, the big battle on TV with Sanjay Gupta), let's just sit and think for ourselves, try to research it out in our small way and then let's come to conclusions. You can't deny the fact that Michael has atleast triggered people to start thinking on this topic with as much attention and passion as is required. Because it is us who are affected by this issue. It concerns us and requires our research and thought.<br /><br />Also to be balanced it is to be said that to understand the implications of whether this socialised medicine will work in a country like USA (with the population of USA which is different from the smaller populations of European countries), how it will affect taxes ? , how good will the treatment be ? How much will be the waiting time ? Is a longer waiting time not justified if a larger number of people get the care ? Then again will the longer wait times mean someone not getting the quick aid he might get in the current system ? All these are not easy questions. These are questions which are better understood by economists, financial planners, doctors, philosophers etc because it is a complex environment with many variables. But we as a normal average joe person with whatever acumen is at our disposal have to take a stand one way or another.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

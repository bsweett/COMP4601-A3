<meta name="summary" content="Great adaptation but it's no Chicago"></head><body><p>I deliberately waited until all the hype was done; all the awards were won, and until I was no longer tired of Beyonce to view "Dreamgirls." It is indeed an excellent presentation.<br /><br />This film is a roman &agrave; clef about the onset and heyday of Motown and in particular one of the most popular R&B groups, The Supremes. We witness their ascent to fame, the divisions between the manager's wants and public tastes and their struggle to remain in vogue in a changing world of popular music.<br /><br />Director of Chicago, another fantastic musical, wheels in a star cast fully showcasing the razzle-dazzle and enchantment of the songs and glittery costumes and wigs by bringing in "Dreamgirls" to the screen. This excellent Broadway production of the 80s put Jennifer Holiday on the map. Apart from top-notch production standards, wonderful costumes, fantastic music, and excellent performances all around, "Dreamgirls" is indeed another wonderful presentation of a slice of African-American life/culture.<br /><br />After watching this I didn't think it was much of a musical so I don't feel its right to compare this to `Chicago' excluding one major scene on stage. I thought all performances were equally fascinating. It's a shame Florence did not have the happy ending Effie did, but such is life. Jamie Foxx gave an understated performance which I found believable. Eddie Murphy also gave a great performance whose impact and appreciation may have been lost due to Eddie's past comedic roles where he basically did the same kind of voice and facial expressions he used here for the Character of Jimmy and I am so glad he got a chance to sing a few songs. I felt this was a strong performance by Eddie especially the scenes where he didn't say a word and his face said it all. It would have been nice to see him win the Academy Award. But there is no denying that Jennifer Hudson overshadows all these Hollywood heavies in this movie with her knockout performance as Effie White. She owns every scene she is in. The part given more meaning for those of us who saw her through the "Idol" drama where she was accused of not having the "Depth" to compete. Well, after I first heard her sing on Idol I too believed she did not belong there....She belonged in a higher place....her voice was a force of nature. Her talent was bigger than IDOL. The dream has really come true for this dreamgirl and I certainly understand the standing ovations it got in some theaters and friends of mine who went to see it in theaters I attest to that.</p></body></html>

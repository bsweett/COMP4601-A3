I was just stunned how good they were.<br /><br />The actual filming is brilliant.<br /><br />The story itself is sometimes a bit weak, still it is from comics so you cannot expect too much there. Whatever short coming in the story was more than made up by some good acting. I thought that everyone played very well.<br /><br />Most entertaining, I would recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Oh what fun we have with so little"></head><body><p>The first Final Destination (I always found the title clunky but oh well) was a memorable entry in the teen horror genre since it wasn't self-referential and kind of dumb as the others. It relied on atmosphere and tension for their scenes whereas Scream or Urban Legend seemed to lack balls in their scenes. Of course the inevitable sequel comes out and this time it's packed with what the first one avoided slightly: gore. Strange as it may sound, this is gore done right. Yeah it's dumb, campy and little redeeming value but somehow you're just entertained by the whole thing.<br /><br />Taking place a year after the Flight 180 disaster from the first one, we now instead follow Kimberly en route to a vacation when she has a premonition of a brutal multiple-car pileup on the freeway and prevents another group of cars from going down the freeway. The pileup happens and the remaining survivors, along with Kimberly find out what the first group had to deal with: Death is mad people lived and he's back, but he's gotten a little bit more creative, and way more gruesome.<br /><br />In the film after this, Wendy (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) says "can you feel how vicious it was?" That pretty much sums up the approach this film and that one have with dispatching its characters. Unlike the first one which were more like freak accidents in a way, this almost seems like Death playing Mousetrap with that knocking over this which turns off that and makes this do that until splat, something happens. It's silly but for some reason, it's dementedly fun. You find it strange that you're getting such a kick out of seeing a guy "Cube"d to death (it's a movie, check it out). The opening sequence with the massive pileup is probably one of the most tension-filled and exciting car crash scenes in recent memory, not to mention it's quite gory. But it's presented in a way that you'll turn very paranoid whenever a big trucker is on the road with you.<br /><br />Is the acting any better? Well, no. The leads are usually the more better but nowhere near great acting. AJ Cook though does an admirable job as Kimberly and proves a good successor to the vision seer role Devon Sawa had in the first one. The rest? Very cookie cutter. The stoner to the impatient bi*ch with things to do to the brash, insensitive man, it's obvious they're just meant to be fodder for Death's viciousness. Returning is Clear Rivers (played by Ali Larter) who helps out Kimberly and her situation. She doesn't really make the film any better but can't go wrong with an additional hottie.<br /><br />For those looking for a simple fun horror movie rather than a serious horror movie pretending it's fun, can't go wrong with this entire series. Yeah, FD2 is filled with a bunch of nonsense but where else can you get a kick out of this stuff for a change?</p></body></html>

One can't help but wonder how that happened, considering how unusual and seemingly uncommerical it is. It is a film about style and mood, which means it is not a strictly staged and constructed production designed to funnel us through all the plot points and mandatory gunfights with a maximum of speed and a minimum of effort from either the producers or the viewers. It has a central plot, for sure, but nothing to demand the 3 hour running time. Not even half of that really. Instead of letting the plot create and then rule the world, Leone created a world and allowed the plot to creep its way through it.  This is something which is disappointingly rare in film, and Leone has made a film which is exceptionally good at performing this rare trick. This style can be a good or a bad thing, depending on who you are, but it's usually a good thing for me, and this film is pretty damn great film, no two ways about it.<p>The basic plot synopsis goes that the 3 titular characters are searching for a hidden treasure of Civil War gold, and though they don't trust or like each other, they need to work together to some degree because no one of them has all the information necessary to find the gold. That however, doesn't tell you a fifth of what actually occurs during the film, and nothing that really matters as far as watching or enjoying the film is concerned.  This is a genuinely epic tale, which is set in a dark, filthy and corrupt world.  This provides a strong contradiction, as there is no epic hero, and no fantastic setting, but instead we have a trio of outlaws, and the backdrop is a long, highly destructive war.(which the characters are not concerned with.) Thus the characters tranverse many miles and do many unlikely deeds, but they do not change the world, and do not care to.  And although they are all outlaws and killers, the sort of destruction they reap pales in comparison to what is occuring around them.  So as this and the other westerns of the era de-mythologized the old west, this film de-mythologizes the rest of the world as well, reminding us that violence, death and corruption were hardly unique to the old west.  Yet this is not all the film is about, and it isn't as dark and cynical as that may make it sound. It still has humor, still has excitement and intrigue and countless other things.(much like the real world) Wisely, no one theme or motif is allowed to dominate for too long. The tone shifts from the comedic to the hyper-dramatic to everything in between at various points in the film, and Leone does them all with ease.  <p>Contrary to my expectations it's Wallach's Tuco Ramirez that dominates the film, not Eastwood's Blondy.  Tuco stands in strong contrast to the other 2 leads, as he is a nervous, tittering character who is often played for laughs yet is still violent and deadly and occasionaly truly brutish and sadistic.  Lee Van Cleef is great as Angel Eyes. He manages to portray an utterly heartless and irredeemible character without turning him into a ridiculous caricature.  These two characters illustrate what makes this film so good.  They stand very close to the edge, nearly becoming overblown and ridiculous, but never going so far as to actually become so.  In many ways Eastwood's Blondy is the least interesting of these 3 characters, but is largely redeemed by the fact that he is, well, cool.  His cool demeanor and sardonic dialogue stand in opposition to the more extreme, polarized characters, and he thus provides a sort of base for the highly-dramatic and stylized film.<p>Good characters aside, the real strength of this film is in the visual and audio presenation. Cinematography and sets are fantastic.  Not so gritty as to be unpleasant to look at but not overdone and overly picturesque either.  Lots of great wide angle shots, particularly during the bridge scenes.  Morricone's famed score is great too. The main theme is overused a bit, but the rest of it is strong, particularly the brilliant Ectasy of Gold and The Trio in the closing scene of the film.  The gunfights are just great.  On one level, they are a sort of anti-action scene, as they are all build-up with little action.  The final shootout in the graveyard naturally stands out, and is one of the great scenes in all film.  It is a clinic in the Leone style, contrasting the beautifully conceived long shots with countless close-ups  of the 3 characters doing essentially nothing. 5 minutes pass between when the last word of dialogue is spoken and the first round is fired in what proves to be a very brief exchange, yet it does not disappoint.  The blaring score and the frantic editing just before the first blast are the true climax, and it is as effective as one could hope.  It is, as many have pointed out, dramatized and extended far more than is reasonable, but it holds up emotionally and visually and thus works beautifully.  The early scene between Angel Eyes and his first target is similarly effecting, and is another standout.  It's got darker more horrific scenes as well, such as Tuco's torturing of Blondy and his later torture at the hands of Wallace.  And many of the scenes with the armies have great sorrow and desolation. In fact, it pretty much all works, so while not every scene may be utterly necessary to move the plot along, they all manage to entertain in varying ways.  Most movies have difficulty entertaining on one level, so this is quite an accomplishment.<p>This is a fine DVD. It looks great, even the restored scenes.  Too bad they don't have old dialogue for them, and you'll definitely notice the new dubbing, but this should only be a mild annoyance at worst.  The extras seem pretty interesting, though I haven't watched them all.  All in all, a good version of a classic. Get it.</p></body></html>

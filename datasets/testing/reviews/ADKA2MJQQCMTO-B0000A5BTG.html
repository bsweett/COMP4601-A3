<meta name="summary" content="It's a summer movie ..."></head><body><p>I'm not really sure how to critique a movie that never really aspires to do anything more then what's already been done before. <p>That said, it was made in the same mold as Independence Day, Armageddon, the list could go on forever. If you liked one, you'll probably like the other. <p>What it has is a believable, although ridiculous, plot, a decent performance by the cast, and pretty good special effects. It's a pop-corn movie in the true mold of one. If you're expecting ANYTHING else you're wasting your time. If all you want is a mildly interesting action movie to kill two hours, you could certainly do a lot worse.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well worth a watch"></head><body><p>From writer/director Stephen Sommers, the man who bought us The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, two of the greatest action/adventure movies of the last decade, comes Van Helsing - a tale of a monster slayer who is sent on a quest to Transylvania to rid the world forever of Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and to save the life of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last member of Transylvania's royal family. To make things more difficult, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) discovers upon his arrival in Transylvania that he is up against more than just the humble vampire. Accompanying Van Helsing on his mission is Carl (David Wenham), a 19th century version of James Bond's Q who, among other things, exhales some truly great one-liners throughout the course of the film, a highlight of which is "Why does it smell like wet dog in here?". I remember this moment induced a huge roar of laughter at the cinema but without seeing the scene that preceded it it's a little hard to appreciate here.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman puts in a very admirable performance indicating once again why he is one of Australia's greatest exports. David Wenham's performance in what is essentially the role of comedic side-kick is extremely funny and entertaining. It is certainly a diversion from his previous roles and a very interesting addition to his repertoire. While playing the role of Count Dracula, Richard Roxburgh with his accent and wig is barely recognisable. He brings to this much-played character a very entertaining fresh twist - indeed it is the uniqueness of Roxburgh's performance that is particularly notable. Having been played so many times before it is becoming inherently difficult to bring something new to the character which Roxburgh has succeeded in doing. Kate Beckinsale very near revives her role from her previous film Underworld, once again trying to vanquish, among other things, werewolves.<br /><br />As you might well have guessed this is a film that relies heavily on the use of special effects and while at times they are spectacular (the horses jumping the ravine is certainly a highlight), this once again proves that effects don't make a film - writing does. While Sommer's intentions were good, if not a little ambitious, the film is a tad clunky at times and doesn't quite deliver in the writing department. That's not to say it a terrible film - nothing could be further from the truth, as it is certainly a worthy addition to the action/adventure genre. However, given my fondness for the two Mummy films it is inevitable that comparisons be made and without being too over-critical Van Helsing simply doesn't compete with either of them. Despite its short-falls Van Helsing is still a fun couple of hours and is well worth a watch.</p></body></html>

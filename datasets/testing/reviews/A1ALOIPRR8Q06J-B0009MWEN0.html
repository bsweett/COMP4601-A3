<meta name="summary" content="the war on...bugs"></head><body><p>STARSHIP TROOPERS is both brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick. The concept behind it and what you get on the screen is a perfect parody of infamous WWII propaganda films. TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized, jingoistic humans for senseless violence without conscience, comicly using a war of humans versus mindless, souless, agressive "bugs" to make the point. In the top 20 best sci-fi films ever and a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

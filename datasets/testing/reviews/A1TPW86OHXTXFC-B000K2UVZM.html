So The Black Dahlia looks and flows great, dripping with the 1940s crime-thriller atmosphere that James Ellroy described in his 1987 novel. On other levels -- plot (overstuffed), suspense (muted), acting (Hilary Swank as a femme fatale? Please!), posing (Scarlett Johansson plays dress-up as a mini Lana Turner), sex (it's all before and after) -- the movie is a bust. The setup is this: Two cops -- Lee Blanchard (a strong Aaron Eckhart) and Bucky Bleichert (a hopeless Josh Hartnett) -- become obsessed with the mutilation and murder of a starlet (Mia Kirshner). De Palma throws everything at the screen, but almost nothing sticks." Peter Travers<br /><br />Like most of you I read James Ellroy's 'The Black Dahlia' and this movie was a totally different experience. Not a good experience, I might add. Elizabeth "Betty" Short, a 22-year-old aspiring actress from New York who was many things to many people. A beloved friend all the way to prostitute. On January 15, 1947, she was discovered dead in a vacant lot Los Angeles.  Two new homicide partners are instructed to investigate this case. The entire city is drawn into the lurid world of the Dahlia's L.A.  "Black Dahlia takes its name and its inspiration both from the murder of Elizabeth Short (known as the Black Dahlia) in Los Angeles in 1947 and from the equally infamous Cleveland Torso Murders that were investigated by Eliot Ness and ceased just prior to the Second World War. Of course, both cases remain unsolved and it has been speculated that they may have been perpetrated by the same killer. Black Dahlia builds on this speculation and weaves in notions of occult rituals based on Norse mythology and of Nazi involvement via a shadowy fifth column at work in the USA."reports Elizabeth Young. The book was so wonderfully written that this movie was a bigger disappointment than it otherwise might be.<br /><br />"Determined to be famous, destined to be infamous, Betty Short affected more lives dead than she could possibly alive. She dreamed of being photographed for the big screen but wound up the pin-up girl of tabloid autopsy photos." Yahoo.<br /><br />This was a movie of mysteries, quandaries and suspense. It never lived up to its potential, and the acting left me feeling 'unfulfilled' and bored. Read 'The Black Dahlia' by James Ellroy but this movie is....<br />Not recommended.  prisrob 2-19-07</p></body></html>

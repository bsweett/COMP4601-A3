The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile Frank Darabont? The guy who actually managed to make two of the four half-decent feature-length Stephen King film adaptations in existence (Misery and 'Salem's Lot are the others-- don't you dare bring up The Shining) made... this? To be fair, though, the first hour and change is pretty good. But man, I can't remember the last time a Stephen King adaptation blew the ending so badly. I probably should have known what I was getting into when I saw the cast was led by Thomas Jane, who has a string of awful movies behind this one (including the should-have-been-stillborn King adaptation Dreamcatcher), but I still held out hope. How terribly wrong I was.<br /><br />Jane plays David Drayton, the successful artist who, the morning after a big storm, goes into town with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) to get some food and supplies to fix the picture window, through which a tree crashed. While they're in the store, a thick mist rolls into town, and brings nasties with it. Drayton and his neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who aren't entirely fond of each other, are trapped in the store with a number of other refugees, including the demented Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a religious nut who slowly begins to convince the people that the mist is a plague from God, and requires human sacrifice. Some army folks from the top-secret base up the hill, however, might have a different explanation-- if anyone can get them to talk.<br /><br />Like I said, the first hour isn't bad, even if Darabont does break one of the cardinal rules of a good monster movie (don't show the bad guy too much). After that, it goes way, way downhill, turning first into a mindless action movie and then into... I'm not sure I have the words to describe what it becomes next. Imagine the cheapest, most suck-out ending you can think of, and then multiply it by three. I mean, it doesn't even work within the context of the scene that came just before it, for heaven's sake. And King actually liked it? This is the guy who wrote "Survivor Type"? I weep.<br /><br />Turn it off after the first hour, and it's fine. **</p></body></html>

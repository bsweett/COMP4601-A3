<meta name="summary" content="Very creepy!"></head><body><p>This is a highly effective horror movie.  In short, a live-in aid/nurse takes a job at a very remote Louisiana home to care for an invalid, only to find out that the people are not what she expected, with an interesting voodoo twist thrown in.  A nearly constant mood of dread and eerieness is skillfully maintained throughout, and the ending/climax is well orchestrated with a few good twists.  Good acting, a good script and strong production values.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

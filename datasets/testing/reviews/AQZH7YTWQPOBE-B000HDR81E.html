<meta name="summary" content="Not sure why watching a dysfunctional couple is so funny"></head><body><p>There are some hilarious moments in this movie, but overall it just reminds me of watching a dysfunctional couple, which is more irritating than funny. It seems the script just finds a bunch of frivolous reasons for Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn to fight, and then lets them yell their heads off. Think of divorced parents fighting, and you'll get the idea. The Break-Up just doesn't do a good job of drawing out the humor of the situations, and instead comes across as a bit too serious.</p></body></html>

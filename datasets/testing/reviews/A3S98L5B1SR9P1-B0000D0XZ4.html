Firstly, a CGI computer animated Hulk who can leap like there is no gravity? What the? Secondly, Eric Bana (the actor who plays Bruce Banner) is looking like a tired kid who's had enough play and is saying "Let me out! I've had enough!" And the truth is, in an Australian interview with the Aussie star, he did claim to dislike working on the Hulk. It's a terrible movie in my opinion. Everything looks so fake due to so much CGI and Eric Bana is in it only because he gets paid so much money.</p></body></html>

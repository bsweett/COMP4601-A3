I had the pleasure of seeing this over Christmas with four kids - 3 girls and a boy, ages 13, 10, 7, and 5 - as well as my still single bother-in-law.  And, everyone in this very diverse group had a wonderful time.<br /><br />TANGLED follows the storyline of the Rapunzel fairy tale, so I won't retell it here.  However, Disney has added humor, music, and enough surprises to turn TANGLED into an delighful, modern story for the 21st century.  Like Tiana from The Princess and The Frog, Rapunzel is not your typical, faint of heart princess; when an intruder breaches her tower, she handily whacks him with a cast iron skillet and makes him her prisoner.  She boldly goes after her destiny and discovers who she really is.  As much as I like Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora, these new Disney princesses go after what they want, work hard, and, (with help from friends) succeed.  And along the way, they and the "prince" end up helping each other.  These are the role models I want for my kids!<br /><br />The animation in TANGLED is gorgeous, the music (Alan Menken!!!) is outstanding and catchy, and the voice acting is excellent.  Mandy Moore is on point as the spunky, strong willed Rapunzel, and she sings beautifully as well.  Donna Murphy (as the wicked witch) and Zachary Levi (as the roguish intruder) both turn in fine voice and singing performances as well.  The animal characters, Maximus, the intrepid war horse, and Pascal, the Jiminy Cricket-like chameleon, don't talk (for once!), but they convey more in expressions and actions than many human characters.  A lot of the LOL funny moments (and there are MANY in TANGLED) occur with these two, and they alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Overall, TANGLED is charming, entertaining, and funny - a treat for the entire family.  And I really love these 21st century Disney princesses; they are strong, independent, hardworking, kind, and loving.  Exactly the kind of young women that I hope for my daughters to be.</p></body></html>

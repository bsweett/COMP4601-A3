<meta name="summary" content="This is what happens when..."></head><body><p>You put a director who doesn't know how to handle the mythology correctly and allows the primary actor to direct from behind his back. His even mentioned that there was over FORTY minutes cut from the movie!<br /><br />I find it hilarious that the "Director's Cut" only adds in a pathetic THREE minutes into the movie, what happened to the other Thirty-Seven minutes? You know why its a "R" rated release now? Inside those three minutes, you will see a actors.. wait for it... Breast!<br /><br />Instant Rate R!.....<br /><br />I didn't like it when I watched it in the theaters. Something there that seemed to nag at me when I walked out at the ending, and I certainly don't like it even more when I found out what was happening behind the scenes to bloat this movie into the 200 Million dollar turkey it turned into! James Cameron spent close to 120 million ('80s/'90s bucks!) to make T2 -which was an Rated R movie no less!- and made a summer blockbuster. Mgee-whiz dumped something equivalent and laid a rotten egg because he couldn't control an actor.<br /><br />Typical hollyweird in action.</p></body></html>

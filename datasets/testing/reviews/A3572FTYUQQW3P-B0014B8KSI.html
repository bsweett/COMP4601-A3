<meta name="summary" content="Flawed but worth watching"></head><body><p>I want to say that I saw this film and really enjoyed it, but I don't think it was a film worthy of the rave reviews I see here.  It is a film that moves along and keeps your attention but once you have seen it you are left with a lot of questions because the film has some substantial logic flaws.  What was the point of the horses?  Why?  Why did he go to the card game when he had already paid off the gamblers?  Why were the bad guys still watching Arthur's apartment once it was sealed?  Why?  If the litigation had dragged on 6 years why had the new CEO signed the incriminating memo?  That would have been written at the outset.  Nevertheless these flaws only become relevant on reflection and do nothing to detract from the film as you watch it.  So the script is well written but flawed.  The cinemaphotography is good although  some of the closeups were way too close and did not show Clooney at his best. The editing has some issues as it leaves you wondering about how things happen.  Of course there was only one obligatory explosion and the now de rigeur profanity.  Hollywood seems to think that everyone uses extreme profanity in ordinary conversation in lieu of punctuation.  Of course this film also incorporates the usual subtext found in most films today and that is the government, CIA. Corporations,and executives are by definition greedy, corrupt, and rape the environment in the name of profit.  However, this message is delivered with great skill by Clooney, Wilkinson, and Swinton.  The camera was not kind to Clooney but he demonstrates his substanitial skill as an actor.  Wilkinson also does a good job as Arthur although he leans toward over acting -- still a very good job.  Swinton had the most difficult role and did a very good job as a person who is clearly in over her head.  She really doesn't know how to cope and is barely able to maintain her composure as events spin out of control.  It is unlikely she will get the praise she deserves because she is overshadowed by Clooney's ability and fame.  This is a good film and I really enjoyed it but in the end it is just another movie that shows how the hero fights "the man".  This film is interesting because in the end our hero manages to destroy the billion dollar corporation, the guilty executives, and the corrupt law firm defending them.  Sort of like a greek tragedy -- in the end everyone is desroyed.  Entertaining and for that I gave it three stars -- but obviously I am in the minority because everyone else seems to think this was an Ocar quality film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful Brad, Bana & Bloom Beat the Crap Out of Each Other"></head><body><p>This impressive looking production is long on action, special effects and beautiful male bodies but is just plain awful when it comes to story.  The Gods are surely NOT smiling.  It's like the Aaron Spelling version of the Trojan War.  "The Silly-iad."<br /><br />That said, TROY remains a heckuva fun way to spend a couple hours if you go in for epic matinee thrill rides.  It's just too bad Paris and Helen have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever...if they did, you could almost understand why a war was waged.  And Achilles's love interest directly feeds the warped notion that prisoners should fall in love with their captors.  Brad Pitt as Achilles is earnest and physically impressive, but he and the kid playing his lookalike cousin still seem like they walked onto the set straight from the Santa Monica pier.  Bana is much more in command of his role as warrior prince.  Poor Peter O'Toole as Priam turns in the second worst performance of his career (Did you ever see SUPERGIRL?).<br /><br />The DVD special features are lots of fun.  Too bad they couldn't have had some knowledgeable historian from the A&E Network do a commentary track to go along with it...would have been interesting to have that perspective.<br /><br />A feast for the eyes.  Just hit the mute button and enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spains submission to last years Oscar is not as strong as 2007's"></head><body><p>There's no coincidence that Guillermo Del Toro presents this film, because he was last years director of the mammoth masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a> That years Spanish submission. And hiding in his huge shadow is J.A. Bayona, the sole director of this film. When you mistakenly put Guillermo's name all over this movie you have to ultimately compare it to the impossibly high standards of his making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone (Special Edition)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7ODI">Hellboy (Director's Cut)</a>. And for a beginning director that's too pretentios to imagine, so I'm going to guess he had no idea that marketing would present his movie to be easily mistaken with Guillermo's. It has none of the stylistic visual flair or the rich storybook imagination that comes with a pure Guillermo film. This film sticks to a few camera filters that drain bright colors and paint a glum picture that sufficates beauty and strangle-holds the actors life essence. Sure, that is the point made by the DOP, but I don't like it. The story is intelligent, sensible, and matter-of-factly/completely boring. The ending is a thriller/suspense cliche. It's as if Sergio G. Sanchez, the writer, flipped through a typical 'how to write a screenplay' from Barnes and Noble and then predictably counted his Plot points and delivered on Night S. Ending <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL3T">Signs (Vista Series)</a> because it was cool.</p></body></html>

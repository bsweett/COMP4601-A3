But I first wanted to see the film that the TV series was based upon.<br /><br />This is a carefully crafted film about the somewhat dubious role that football is allowed to play in the lives of small town Americans.  What many people seem to miss in seeing the film is the deeply critical aspects of the film.  While the struggles of Permian High School to overcome the loss of their star player Boobie Miles -- who is portrayed as a 1988 high school equivalent of today's Darren McFadden of Arkansas (like McFadden, Miles is portrayed as someone who is spectacularly fast, a great receiver, and even an accomplished passer) -- take center stage, there is also a quiet but pervasive criticism of the role that football is allowed to play in people's lives in this small town.  There is the sadness of several former players who have never been able to find meaning in their lives after hanging up their cleats.  There is also the poignancy of people utterly obsessed with the failure or success of the local high school team, as if there was some connection between the quality of their lives and the fate of the team.  From the beginning to the end of the movie there is a sense that these are people without lives, so that while on one level we celebrate the victories of the team on another we experience a deep sadness.  I kept thinking of something Kierkegaard wrote while watching the movie.  He distinguished between the comic and the tragic, characterizing the latter as regarding with finite interest that which ought to be of eternal interest, while identifying the comic as regarding something finite as of eternal interest.  In this sense, the movie is at its heart a tragicomedy.  The movie doesn't explore precisely why these people have such sad lives, but it leaves no question at the end that they do.<br /><br />This is a very slick movie, which is impressive given that it was essentially a low budget film (it was made for around $30 million) with a very large cast.  As a result the film has pretty much a no name cast, the only actor that most people would be familiar with being Billy Bob Thornton.  But the film never reveals its low budget.  From beginning to end every aspect is highly polished.<br /><br />I mentioned the way that the movie criticizes our obsession with football and how this obsession is contrasted with the fundamental emptiness in the lives of the characters in the film.  The two characters who most display these aspects of the film are the aforementioned Boobie Miles and former star Charles Billingsley, played by country music star Tim McGraw.  The only thing that Miles has going for him at the start of the film is his athletic ability and as we hear him struggling to read a recruiting letter we realize that he is borderline illiterate.  When he learns that his knee injury is far worse than anyone imagined he realizes how little life has to offer him.  He is a man with rapidly collapsing horizons.  Billingsley, on the other hand, has only his memories of having starred for Permian.  He relentlessly drives his son to achieve a similar kind of success so that he can relive some of it vicariously.<br /><br />This film in the end is not a celebration of football, but a paean on our excessive obsession with what is, in the end, only a game.  It does not mean that football is devoid of all redeeming values, but it does mean to point out that there is more to life than football.</p></body></html>

Mark McPherson played by a tough talking Dana Andrews is investigating the brutal shotgun murder of Laura Hunt.  Hunt, a socialite and high powered advertising executive is played by a glamorous and confident Gene Tierney.  The film commences with Andrews interviewing the unquestioned star of the show, Clifton Webb, playing the celebrated yet cantakerous and acerbic critic Waldo Lydecker. Lydecker through his influence and contacts has elevated Laura from the stenography pool up the ranks in both her industry and society.  He was deeply in love with her and insanely jealous.<br /><br />Lydecker felt threatened when playboy Shelby Carpenter played by an oily Vincent Price moved in on Laura using his smooth Southern charm.  They soon announced their engagement to marry which was short circuited by her death.<br /><br />Andrews spending time in the murdered girl's apartment looking for clues finds himself becoming enamored with Tierney's portrait.  The plot takes an unexpected twist when Laura returns home after being away in the country to contemplate her potential betrothal and confronts Andrews.  Evidently someone else had been murdered but who and by whom?<br /><br />The major flaw in this otherwise memorable flick was the very obvious identity of the murderer.  The musical score was an excellent enhancement to the haunting mood of the movie.  Judith Anderson playing Ann Treadwell, a middle aged society woman in love with and bankrolling the seamy Price also was very good in her supporting role.</p></body></html>

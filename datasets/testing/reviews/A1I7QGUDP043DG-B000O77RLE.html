<meta name="summary" content="The other side of  a war."></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood deserves huge kudos for tackling the 'other side' of a big war movie, and so close to 'Flags of Our Fathers', which I also enjoyed immensely.  The Japanese actors are excellent and the dialogue was snappy and original, though I had to re-wind a couple times because my eyes couldn't keep up with the subtitles.  I tend to go 'cross-eyed' if it's fast.  I especially love the baker character who didn't really want to be there and left a young, pregnant wife at home.  The movie was excellent in showing how many get caught up in a war they don't necessarily believe in.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Watchmen"></head><body><p>I went into this movie hungry for another superhero movie.  It was one of those movies that I just had to see.  I did not read Watchmen the graphic novel, so I really didn't know what I was in for.  But that's part of the fun sometimes.  Unfortunately I cannot say this movie was a pleasant surprise.  The trailer showed me it had potential, which is really all I had to go on.  Call me crazy, but I prefer the traditional superhero movie without the gore and the sex and the bright blue penis.  But on the plus side, the special effects were nice, the fight choreography was pretty good, and some parts were really neat, like Dr. Manhattan on Mars.  He was a cool character.  I especially liked how he could dismantle and suspend things in midair, make clones of himself, teleport, and grow to a ginormous size.  Nevertheless, this is not a movie for children.  Get them a babysitter if you want to see this film.  Should you see this film in the theater, or buy it on DVD?  Tough call.  If you liked the darkness of the last 2 Batman films (with Christian Bale), you are in the ballpark of the dark vibe of Watchmen, but Watchmen has more sex and gore.  Maybe read a few reviews before you decide, unlike me, who just saw the trailer before seeing it.</p></body></html>

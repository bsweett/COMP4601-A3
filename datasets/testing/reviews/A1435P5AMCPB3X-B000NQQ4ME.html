<meta name="summary" content="Original story, but boring to watch"></head><body><p>This movie has plenty of quick and violent scenes, and the camera work and shots are excellent, but there is a ton of running, the character development is fair but flimsy, and overall this turns into a 2 hour film of a man running through the jungle.  Very simple premise, simple to watch, worth viewing once.  Not the worst movie of the year, but not the best.</p></body></html>

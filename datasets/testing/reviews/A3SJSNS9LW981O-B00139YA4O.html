<meta name="summary" content="The story: "Lost." The Viewers: "FOUND!""></head><body><p>Finally, finally, finally... there is a unique and original drama series on television!<br /><br />Everything else is old soap... CSI times twelve, Law and Order over and over, Desperate Housewives a sexed up, prime time soap opera...<br /><br />Finally, we have a series that offers almost everything. Deep, complicated and flawed human characters... mysterious puzzles... romance here and there...  and true chills and thrills!<br /><br />The only complaint I would have is that "Lost" moves at a snail's pace. Other than that,<br /><br />LONG LIVE "LOST!"<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

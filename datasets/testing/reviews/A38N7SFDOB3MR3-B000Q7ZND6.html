<meta name="summary" content="Worth a Viewing. 71 out of 100."></head><body><p>Constantine is the story of a demonologist/exorcist who was born with the unique and uncanny abilities to see and combat demons(and angels), and other creatures from hell. The story begins with the finding of the "Sword of Destiny" - the sword that was used to spear Jesus Christ on the Cross at Calvary - and ends with John Constantine battled none other than Lucifer himself.<br /><br />Constantine moves along at a good pace and provides an immersive story that will keep you engrossed. There are grand battles with flying demons, and a good working chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Rachal Weisz. Overall, you will walk away from Constantine having been entertained as well as glad you stepped into the fictional world of the "Hellblazer."<br /><br />There are some weak spots to the film. Keanu Reeves was generally very convining, but had moments (especially when he was smoking cigarettes) where he seemed a little off. There were also some blatant inconsistancies that can leave the audience scratching their collective heads. For example: in the first 45 minutes of Constantine, John Constantine is continuously smoking cigarettes, and we are shown (quite often) the severity of his lung cancer. Then, for seemingly no reason, this character issue is forgotten. There is no hint of cigarettes or lung cancer until one of the last scenes.<br /><br />Despite these odd defects, Constantine is worth viewing.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 71<br /><br />38 (out of 50).

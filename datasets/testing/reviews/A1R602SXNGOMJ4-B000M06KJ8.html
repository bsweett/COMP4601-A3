Kirsten Dunst was not very well suited at all for this character. Her performance came off as very artificial, not realistic at all.  Characters spoke in modern American English with a limited vocabulary (not even a fake French accent), the music was distracting and felt very out of place in nearly every scene, and because of the lack of character, I didn't care what happened to anyone. And it feels like it's about four hours long.  The film is utterly useless to anyone who wishes to learn anything about Marie Antoinette's life.<br />Apparently, Sofia didn't inherit the talent gene from Daddy.</p></body></html>

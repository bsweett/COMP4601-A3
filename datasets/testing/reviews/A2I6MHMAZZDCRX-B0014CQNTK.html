The father is her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).  Her first thought, naturally, is to have an abortion.  But when she can't go through with that, she decides to find a nice couple to adopt it.<br /><br />Of course, finding Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) was just the beginning.  She also has to tell her dad and step-mother (J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney).  And she has to carry the baby to term while attending classes at high school.  How will she handle the next few months?<br /><br />If you are thinking about seeing this film, you should take the PG-13 rating seriously.  The movie, especially the first third, is filled with crude language and talk about sex.  I expected that going in, but it still made me cringe.<br /><br />Fortunately, once the movie gets going those things are kept to a minimum.  The story is only slightly realistic, but I got so caught up in it I really didn't care.  They even manage to throw in a twist or two to make the movie unpredictable.<br /><br />This movie works because of the characters.  You absolutely love them from the start and want things to work out well for them.  And the characters work because the acting is universally great.  Ellen Page deserved his Oscar nomination.  In my eyes, the other standout is Jennifer Garner.  You could actually feel her character's longing to have a child.<br /><br />The movie is a comedy, and I did laugh out loud.  Most of the time, however, I chuckled and smiled.  Still, it had a warmth to it that was absolutely charming.<br /><br />Some critics have argued this movie glorifies teen pregnancy.  Frankly, that is a risk any movie runs when it tries to deal with a sensitive subject like this.  While it doesn't dwell on the negatives of the situation (hence my comment about the story not being realistic), it doesn't make things rosier then they are either.  In the end, it is a life affirming movie that is about people taking the twists and turns of life and dealing with them the best way they know how.<br /><br />And for that reason, I liked this movie.  Yes, the first third had me cringing more then I expected to.  But it was a film well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

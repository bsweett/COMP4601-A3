I already had a handfull of choices and I was stocking up for travel. I saw the cover and thought I might enjoy a sci-fi action movie so I bought it.<br /><br />It was a mistake FOR ME. Apparently this is a sequel and I was missing out on the origins of the story. The definitely handicapped my understanding and enjoyment of the events protrayed. What I did see was a fairly lavish action movie with some great lines and some great stunts. It meant very little to me, however. I think I need to see the prequel to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />You may want this movie but you should want its predecessor first.</p></body></html>

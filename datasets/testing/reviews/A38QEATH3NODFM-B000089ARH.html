A great film about a genious 15 year old true fan of music that gets the break of a lifetime to write for rolling stone magazine.  He gets to go on the road with Stillwater, a fictional band, in 1973. But the music is great, the story is good, and you really get to know the characters.  Definite collection film, also available is a directors cut.</p></body></html>

Perhaps the film was just not that good.  In fact, it was probably a bit of both.<br /><br />I suspect the New York fashion industry has its fair share of piranhas swimming about in the pond.  Yet, having said this, "The Devil Wears Prada" was simply an attempt to use caricature as a vehicle for comedy.  This works for a while but, at some point, it begins to wear a bit thin.<br /><br />Can I recommend this film to the reader?  Alas, no.  Save your time and money for something else.</p></body></html>

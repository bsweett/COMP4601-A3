<meta name="summary" content="By Far The Best Harry Potter Film!"></head><body><p>I'm NOT a Harry Potter fan! The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film -  very disturbing. But they finally  got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining!  It stands on its own.  It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it!<br /><br />After leaving the theater, it dawned on me that this story is truly from a European perspective. Anyone in Europe who has lived through War World 2 knows first hand what a powerful monster (dictator) can do to a society. It's not an abstraction, like it is for the vast majority of Americans. While Lord Voldemort  is physically portrayed as a devil, what he really is is a very powerful war lord. One that would be only to happy to destroy any person, group of persons or institutions that stand in his way of absolute power. He exists for no other reason. He's not after wealth or glory, just raw power!<br /><br />There's even a Neville Chamberlin character in this rather clever film. He and his allies are so blind to the obvious threat of war that they undermine everything they profess to hold dear. They are so arrogant and foolhardy they become caricatures of sheer stupidity.<br /><br />There is so much good that can be extracted from this story - what it means to a leader, that wisdom can come from the most unlikely of places, the importance of planning ahead, there is strength in numbers,  don't always believe what you read, improvise in a crisis,  help can come when you least expect it!<br /><br />I have high hopes for the final Harry Potter film. If Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is any indication of what is to come - I wait with great anticipation!</p></body></html>

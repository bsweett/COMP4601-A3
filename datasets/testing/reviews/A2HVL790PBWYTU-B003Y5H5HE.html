Yep, there is a heightened sense of reality in that the panoramic cinematography and the fabulous set designs evoke a childlike sense of wonder. There is a fairy tale ambiance of sorts. HUGO is a fable concerning an intrepid orphan boy and a long neglected artist, care worn and bitter and resigned to fading into obscurity.<br /><br />His pa deaders and his hard-imbibing uncle having amscrayed for parts unknown, young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) has been living in a post World War I Parisian train station, inhabiting the walls, navigating the catwalks and catacombs and precarious steps that make up the train station's dusty inner sanctum. Hugo keeps busy by doing his uncle's work. He's been secretly tending to the clocks in the sprawling train station. In his spare time, he strives to piece together a mysterious broken-down wind-up automaton that was abandoned in a museum. Hugo believes fervently that the little metal man, when functioning properly, will reveal a message from his father. But Hugo is stumped by a missing heart-shaped key which activates the automaton. Hugo perseveres, long as there's food to filch and his father's notebook to guide him and mechanical bits to steal from the toy salesman's booth.<br /><br />Hugo has an affinity for machinery, a knack for fixing gadgets. This serves him well when his luck runs out as a thief and he's nabbed by old Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), him what runs the toy booth. The furious Papa Georges nevertheless indulges in an act of kindness; he takes on Hugo as a booth assistant. Around this time Hugo meets Papa Georges' niece Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz), and so we're introduced to the film's best performance in my opinion. Chlo? Grace Moretz radiates a warmth and great charm. Her Isabelle is captivating and inquisitive and effortlessly rolls off literary references. I love that she savors them fanciful words, words such as "reprobate" and "clandestine" and "covert lair" lovingly tripping from her tongue. But Isabelle is tired of living vicariously thru books; she longs for an adventure of her own. And she embarks on one with Hugo. At one point, she's heard to remark: "This is marvelous. I feel just like Jean Valjean." Except that she's ever more lively than good old Prisoner #24601.<br /><br />It's interesting. The first half of HUGO tracks our scampering orphan's escapades and the tone is very much adventurous. But somewhere in the middle bits, it seems as if director Martin Scorsese finally put his foot down and decided to go ahead with what really drew him to this project. Scorsese loves cinema, and somewhere you must've seen him espousing a cause near and dear to his heart: the preservation of old films. His passion for old movies and the salvaging of them fold into this picture. I won't say what, but there is a huge reveal somewhere in the middle bits, and the tone alters some and the spotlight sort of veers away from Hugo, even though Hugo is still the catalyst to everything that happens hence.<br /><br />HUGO is a film for kids, but maybe not all kids. The visuals are dazzling and enthralling and whoever came up with them should be tapped for an Oscar nomination. For those who harbor love for silent pictures or are curious about the early days of cinema, the second half of HUGO is a marvel, as only an affectionate valentine by Scorsese could be. As in the source material, HUGO shines a light on a near-forgotten pioneer of cinema, a talent who once upon a time made over 500 films until the advent of the first world war and the movie audience's shifting tastes forced him to sell his films, of which celluloid were broken down to chemicals and refashioned into the heels of women's shoes. And you wonder why this old bloke is melancholy?<br /><br />I've isolated Chlo? Grace Moretz as my favorite performer in this film. Doesn't mean that the rest of the cast sucks asphalt. This is a terrific cast, from Butterfield to Kingsley to a fantastic Helen McCrory (who makes the most of her minimal screen time) to Christopher Lee (who lends benevolent weight as the librarian Monsieur Labisse). Even Sacha Baron Cohen restrains himself and is fine and funny as Gustave Gaston, the bum-legged Station Inspector whose mission in life - when not wooing the shy flower lady - is to corral all runaway urchins and send them packing to the orphanage. Cohen's antics and his lanky build remind me in some ways of a Keystone Kop or maybe Tony Azito who played the cowardly police sergeant in THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Some effective slapstick moments provided by Cohen... and that police dog.<br /><br />If immortal folks like Chaplin, Keaton, and Fairbanks evoke fond memories or some recognition, then HUGO treats you very finely. Location-wise, this is as idealized a version of Paris as you and I can hope to see. The automaton is a steampunkish concoction of gears and coils and springs and thingamajigs, and, early on, is what drives the narrative, piques our curiosity. The kid actors contribute mature performances. And because this is the kind of film that delivers the goods, chances are solid that, by the closing moments, our forgotten filmmaking pioneer will take taken his bows, remembered once more. HUGO isn't fantasy in the mold of Harry Potter and such. But Scorsese introduces an enchantment of sorts, one somewhat anchored in reality. But I've always considered Scorsese magical, even when his subject matter is scurrilous mafiosos (which by the way sounds like a nasty medical condition). Scorsese again demonstrates his great craft. To lift from Hugo Cabret's vocabulary, Scorsese is like... clockwork.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great film"></head><body><p>AT first I was concerned about this movie, about whether it would sustain my interest beyond the sheer force of the actresses involved.  Watchign Nicole Kidman first appear and then vanish like a wisp of smoke into Virginia Wolff was amazing.  Since To Die For, I've always thought her talented at the art of vanishing but she proves here again that its not a trick but a conscious ability.<br />Julianne Moore as always is a woman on the verge of....soemthing.....she plays longing well.  Someone who MUST make a change in their lives and who knows it.  Of the three actresses she gets to bridge the time frames of two of the characters to interact and though thsi requires heavy makeup, it sort of works.  Not very well but it does work.<br />Meryl Streep's piece is more ethereal because she's at the center of so many people's lives and expectations and she seems like she's been maintaining distance for awhile and no one has noticed.  The ability to play someone who wants to speak up but can't or won't is pretty incredible.<br />All in all this is a great film, and as always I advise patience with the film, its revealed how everyone is connected soon enough.<br />Ed Harris who's scenes are him floating in and out of dementia are also gripping as we only have Streep's character's adore for him to project what his life was like, who he was onto the canvas of someone in their last days.</p></body></html>

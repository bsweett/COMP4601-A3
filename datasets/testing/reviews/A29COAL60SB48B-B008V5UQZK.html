<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful movie"></head><body><p>Nia Vardalos's script bit into the stereotypes but it managed to not be stereotypical at the same time.<br /><br />The movie is about culture and ethnic identity, something that Americans were taught since Day One to reject because we're all supposed to be part of the big "melting pot."  It's the main reason why the majority of the folks who put this movie down here just don't get it.<br /><br />Too bad people couldn't pay attention to the beautiful and timeless Greek traditions that Toula explained in the movie and the fact that even though she was marrying outside of her ethnic group, her family supported her decision (begrudgingly) and not only gave her a beautiful wedding (in a Greek Orthodox church) but her father managed to put his feelings aside and buy his daughter and her new husband a house (even if it happened to be right next door).<br /><br />I guess, in the end, you have to be Greek (which I'm part, through my Italian side) or be a Greek-lover to understand and truly appreciate this movie.<br /><br />Thumbs up to Nia for an original script and a beautiful movie (and for casting extra cute John Corbett as the non-Greek husband).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too contrived, too complicated"></head><body><p>The interaction between Costner and Hurt works in spots in the movie, but that is about the only thing this movie has going for it. The plot is too contrived and complicated. Brooks's daughter drops out of college as a freshman, she is pregnant, she loses the car and is probably a mass murderer. Demi Moore is a homicide cop, going through a very messy divorce, is running from a mass murderer, and she is a millionare. She is very unlikeable and tougher than any man. Brooks commits a murder, but doesn't notice the drapes are open. Excuse me, this guy researches the couples he is going to execute for days. Everyone in the neighborhood knows that this couple has sex with the lights on and the drapes open. Brooks misses this fact in his research? This lapse makes it convenient for the neighbor who is a photogapher to catch him the act. However, the photographer wants to join in with the killing and not turn him in. This is lucky for Mr. Brooks and is unlucky for the photographer of course. How could the photograper plausibly think he could escape being murdered?<br /><br />The only thing this movie has going for it is that Costner does a decent job holding the movie together. The Hurt as the alter ego usually works. Demi does not work at all. The style of the movie smooths over the gigantic plot holes, but the movie is a mess if you start thinking about it.</p></body></html>

Director Lee, of course, has gotten some attention lately for his work on the film version of Marvel's _The Hulk_ (which I think is an excellent, excellent film as well as a true-to-spirit screen adaptation of the original Stan Lee/Jack Kirby comic-book series). And Yuen, of martial-arts-choreography fame, is especially well known for his brilliant work on the Wachowski brothers' _Matrix_ series (which are among my personal favorite movies ever).<p>If you like their work on those other films, you'll love seeing what they can do together. _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ is a triumph in every respect.<p>The cinematography is, in the literal sense of the word, spectacular. This is one of those movies that you can pause at _any_ frame and see an artfully constructed composition -- the lights and shadows, the colors, the placement of the human figures. And of course the Chinese scenery is magnificent. (Lee, who is from Taiwan and resides in New York, got special permission from the government of China to film his movie there.)<p>The martial-arts scenes, choreographed by Yuen, are more real than reality. If you haven't moved like this in your dreams, I don't envy you your dreams. Physical bodies may not move like this, but minds do.<p>And actually, 'choreographed' is a good description of _all_ the movement in the film, both physical and dramatic. The film (based on the novel of the same name) incorporates elements of Hong Kong wuxia films but takes up these elements into a higher and deeper synthesis. The plot ostensibly centers on the theft of a sword called the 'Green Destiny' by the mysterious outlaw known as Jade Fox (sort of a Chinese Zorro). But in addition to the intrigue and the undeniably cool martial-arts stuff, there are two romances, a whole lot of philosophical/spiritual tug-of-war in the subtext, and some sly, subtle, and subversive questioning of tradition, all of it rolled up into one big thematic package. And -- I'm not exaggerating here -- _every_ 'movement' in the film participates in its Taoist-spirited thematic development.<p>I could comment at length on the actors, but I'll restrict myself here to admiring the work of actress/martial artist Michelle Yeoh. I'm sure people in other parts of the world have known of her for some years, but (like many others here in the U.S.) I first saw her in _Tomorrow Never Dies_ and she was easily my favorite part of the movie. (For this film, incidentally, she had to learn to speak Mandarin. I'm certainly not the person to judge her performance in that respect, but people who know the language have said that she did her job well.) She's well paired with Chow Yun Fat (who here sports a funky Manchu hairdo). I'll also mention Tan Dun's captivating soundtrack.<p>The DVD has some nifty special features (including a commentary by Ang Lee and James Schamus, a making-of documentary, and a conversation with Yeoh), but the best part is the set of options on the audio portion of the movie itself. If you want to listen to it in Mandarin and hear the actors' original voices, you'll find the English subtitles quite sufficient. And if you want to listen to it in English, you'll find that the vocal overdubs are _so_ well done that you may not even notice that they're overdubs. Somebody took extra-special care with this stuff.<p>This is a nice package all around, with something for everybody who appreciates fine filmmaking. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

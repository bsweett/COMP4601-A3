The men of the unit don't remember much of what happened after the attack but they all remember that they were saved because of the actions of Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber).  After the conflict, Shaw was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor by his commanding officer, Capt. Ben Marco (Denzel Washington).  Shaw won the award and the recognition he received allowed him to successfully run for political office.<br /><br />Years later Major Marco runs into another member of his unit, Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) from those days who questions Marco about what really happened in the desert and asks him if he ever has any dreams.  Marco politely dismisses Melvin's accusations, but he knows he speaks the truth because he hasn't stopped having any dreams since he returned home and he spends his time off duty as a broken man.  Melvin's meeting sets off a chain reaction with Marco's brain and he begins to remember things better.  When he sees that Raymond Shaw has been nominated for a Vice Presidential nomination, he sets out to meet with Shaw and discover the truth.  It's a journey down a rabbit hole more terrifying than anything Alice ever met: from mind altering implants beneath the skin, convenient murders, brainwashing, with an international corporation known as Manchurian Global trying to covertly take over the world.<br /><br />When I first heard that Hollywood was going to remake THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, I was very skeptical.  The original film has become a classic example of political intrigue.  That film was made in the heyday of the Cold War and not only captured the hovering suspicion leftover from McCarthyism, but also portrayed the attempted assassination of a president, eerily foreshadowing what actually happened to President Kennedy just a few month later.<br /><br />Two generations have passed since original THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and the geopolitical landscape of the world has changed drastically.  Except for the overpopulated nation of China and a few small countries scattered around the globe, Communism no longer poses a threat to democracy.  In its stead we are faced with a new type of conflict that has no national, political, and religious borders.  This new conflict provides the opportunity for businesses to engage in legal international war profiteering, something that the world has never seen the likes of.  It is against this backdrop that the new THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is set warning not of sabotage from a foreign power, but of a secret and sublime internal takeover brought about by corporate greed.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  The acting is top-notch with fine performances from all lead actors (Washington, Schreiber, and Meryl Streep as Eleanor Shaw give Oscar-worth performances) and most of the supporting cast.  The script has been rewritten in such a way that it doesn't mess with the spirit of the original film and novel, but is able to add some new twists and present the troubling concept as a very real possibility more relevant than ever in our current political landscape.  The film has a great plot, wonderful writing, and some very powerful artistic and directorial techniques that add to overall tone.<br /><br />Of course, even if I believed otherwise I might not say it because even now they're watching you, you know.<br /><br />The DVD includes a commentary with director Jonathan Demme and co-writer Daniel Pyne, a couple of featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, outtakes with optional commentary, and Liev Schreiber's screen test.</p></body></html>

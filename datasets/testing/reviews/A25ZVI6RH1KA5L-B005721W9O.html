The story is about the actors from a short lived sci-fi show and what they do to earn a living, surviving on faded fame.  Amid the sci-fi conventions, store grand openings, and internal squabbles, they suddenly find themselves thrust into senario straight out of their old TV show.  It seems a distance race of aliens has intercepted television transmissions from Earth and regards what they see as 'historical documents'.  They mold their lives and civilization around this old sci-fi show, right down to creating an exact replica of the space ship from the show.  As it turns out, the aliens are in serious trouble and need the assistance of the Galaxy Quest members to help them deal with another, hostile alien race.<br /><br />Watching the actors now having to deal with the reality of the situation, as it were, is extremely funny.  All do a great job, but my favorite is Sam Rockwell's character, Guy.  He was the actor who was one episode and credited as 'Crewman Number 6'.  In his episode, he died in a horrible fashion, and quick enough as to never have gotten a full character name.  With this extremely minor claim to fame, he milks it for all it's worth, following the mainstay actors around on their convention and store opening circuit, like a parasitic organism hanging tenously on to the best thing he has going for him.  Once the fantasy becomes reality, he provides some of the most memorable moments with his constant fears that he will die in some horrible manner due to the fact that he was such a minor character on the original show.  My favorite lines in the movie comes from his character when he's looking at a tatical display and they are about to be attacked by an enemy ship...<br /><br />Guy Fleegman: Hey guys, there's a red-thingy moving toward the green-thingy.<br />Jason Nesmith: What?<br />Guy Fleegman: Red-thingy moving toward the green-thingy. I think we're the green-thingy.<br /><br />Anyway, I think this movie did a great job in having fun with the whole 'Star Trek' fans while not ripping them to shreds.  This movie has a tendancy to grow on you, with its humor and the special effects are quite good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too Much Action, Too Little Acting"></head><body><p>The film Eagle Eye advertised itself as an action/adventure film with an aspect of goverment intruige ("Big Brother is watching").  While the film definately delivers in the action department, there really isn't much else to it.<br /><br />The basic plot of the film centers on two ordinary people who are suddenly "activated" as terrorists and must flee for there lives while only taking mesages from all the electronic devices around them (cell phones, billboards, streaming text lines, LED signs, etc.).  As they continue to flee, they eventually figure out what is happening to them and begin hatching a plan to stop it.<br /><br />The reason why this movie fails, though, is that is doesn't focuses on the dramatic elements that are actually interesting.  Without giving any spoilers, the film would have been much better served focusing on two areas: 1. The technology behind why the two U.S. citizens are "activated" in the first place; and 2. The relationship between the two lead characters played by Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.<br /><br />Instead, however, this film is little more than one pulse-pounding action sequence after another with just enough (but much too little) exposition to move the plot forward to the next crazy chase scene.  Plus, the focus of the film seemed to be on the fact that the two citizens can be communicated with or found by any electronic device.  However, it covered much of the same territory that Will Smith and Gene Hackman did in Enemy of the State a decade ago.  There wasn't enough new material to really hook me into this plot thread.<br /><br />Thus, if you a huge fan of non-stop action in films, you will love this film.  If you need some character and plot development to keep your interest, though, then skip this movie, as you will just be disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unrealistic, but Will Smith and Kevin James are fantastic."></head><body><p>What you are about to see in no way resembles real life.  There is no date doctor that will cut down the boundaries between two people to get them to meet up.  There is no way a beautiful and famous movie star would hook up with an unemployed accountant the way they did in the movie.  And when it comes to dialogue, people just don't talk the way they did in this movie.  So, if you are going to see this movie, please understand that reality is not reflected at all in this movie.<br /><br />But if you would like a silly and cute romantic comedy, then you might want to check this out.... at a video store.  I wouldn't recommend buying it because I think watching it once will be enough.<br /><br />But I do have a bone to pick with the humor of this movie.  Every single funny part of this movie was shown in the previews.  There was nothing really funny that I hadn't seen before watching the movie.  All that was left was the kind of funny parts.<br /><br />And, let's be honest, if this movie did not have Will Smith and Kevin James then it would have been a complete dud.  Why?  Because they are fantastic.<br /><br />First, Will Smith.  I've always loved Will Smith.  He has a charisma that carries naturally on the screen and I look forward to every movie he is in (okay, I haven't caught "Ali" yet).  Though he plays the same character in every movie (goofy, funny, full of energy, and loveable) he is still a character that I can't get enough of.  And he doesn't disappoint in this movie.  For a first venture into a romantic comedy I think he did well with the script provided him.<br /><br />And then Kevin James.  I haven't watched his show "King of Queens" and I don't know of any movie he has done, but I really hope to see more of Kevin James.  He did his role well and I couldn't think of anybody else that could have played that part better.  Kevin James nailed his character perfectly.  I see a great star rising.<br /><br />So, who should see this?  Well, anybody who likes a decent romantic comedy or even a regular comedy should watch it once.  Rent it, don't buy.  Only people who rushed to the theaters and still love it would want this in their collection.</p></body></html>

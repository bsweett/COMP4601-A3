I bought the DVD because of the universal acclaim, as well as the fact that I enjoy good sci-fi. Well, this isn't so much sci-fi as much as a warning (as is most sci-fi); it could be a great argument for pro-life, and the repercussions are well examined. Clive Owen is absolutely perfect, a man who knows his limits but is caught up in something that his own sensibilities can't fathom. He doesn't know what's happening around him, but he has a solid sense of right & wrong. To try to explain more would be redundant, since previous reviewers have nailed the power of the film. The art direction is amazing in its bleakness, and the stunning cinematography can't be equalled. I've thought of this film many times since I watched it, but it may take a few days before I watch it again. Some of the images are in my head forever. This film requires concentration. I wish I could've seen it on the big screen. The DVD extras are plentiful and insightful. An amazing film achievement. Bravo, Senor Cuaron.</p></body></html>

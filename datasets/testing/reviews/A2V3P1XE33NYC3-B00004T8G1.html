<meta name="summary" content="The Way a DVD Should Look"></head><body><p>Thanks in large part to the frenetic efforts of John Carpenter, the horror film medium flourished in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Few fans of the genre need a reminder that Carpenter directed the classic &quot;Halloween,&quot; an independent film that went on to great success and eternal status as a cult classic. While the tale about the merciless Michael Myers certainly didn't invent the slasher film (look back to Mario Bava's classic &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot; to see an earlier effort), it influenced many others to carry the torch in the following years. Carpenter's follow up to &quot;Halloween,&quot; a nice little chiller called &quot;The Fog,&quot; moved rapidly away from a maniac wielding a knife and screaming teenagers, focusing instead on psychological terror and supernatural eeriness to scare the masses. Carpenter's recent films just don't compare with his early fright fests. That's a darn shame, but for horror aficionados, watching the troika of &quot;Halloween,&quot; &quot;The Fog,&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; will always deeply satisfy.<p>The citizens of the coastal town of Antonio Bay are proud of their town and its approaching centennial celebration. It's unfortunate the town harbors a gruesome secret dating back to 1880, but most of the residents know nothing about what the city founders did to the crew of the Elizabeth Dane on a foggy night back in the last century. Even the descendents of those hardy town fathers, one of them the town priest played by Hal Holbrook, aren't aware of the evil committed off of Spivey Point. When the discovery of a diary from one of the pioneering figures surfaces, it's far too late to stem the curse rising from the bottom of the sea. For the long dead crew of the Elizabeth Dane seeks bloody retribution for the crimes of Antonio Bay, and as the clock strikes midnight the townspeople have little idea of the terror moving in from the ocean. Now, everyone in town is fair game as ghosts with a grudge sweep through the streets. Possible victims include local radio station owner Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau), hitchhiker Elizabeth Stolley (Jamie Lee Curtis), Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh), and Nick Castle (Tom Atkins). As the body count rises and the fog grows thicker, the principal characters head to the local church and the final showdown between the ghosts and the townspeople.<p>I know several hardcore horror fans who dislike Carpenter's &quot;The Fog.&quot; They grumble about the lack of splatter effects, the reliance on fog as a crucial plot point, and the lack of screen time dedicated to Jamie Lee Curtis. Two of these arguments carry weight: there is a scarcity of gore and Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely not the star of the movie. Where I draw the line with these complaints concerns the claim that the fog doesn't provide enough chills. Like Stevie Wayne says several times during the movie, it's what's in the fog that brings disaster to the residents of Antonio Bay. The glowing, swirling mass hiding a hideous curse definitely worked for me, and it ought to work for other viewers as well. Cripes, this is a ghost story! What better way to introduce vengeful ghosts from a shipwreck than through a supernatural fog bank? Watching that pulsating fog roll in over the town bringing death to the descendents of the original settlers provided plenty of chills. Besides, if you really wish to criticize the film, look for a few improbabilities in the script. Why, for example, do the ghosts from the Elizabeth Dane seek to harm Stevie? She isn't one of the descendents of the town that the spirits hold accountable, yet the phantasms chase her with the intent of doing bodily harm. That question alone deserves more criticism than concerns over Curtis's screen time or a lack of gruesome scenes. Besides, Curtis apparently doesn't consider &quot;The Fog&quot; important enough to contribute a new interview for the DVD release. Both Janet Leigh and Adrienne Barbeau took the time to film a few comments, but Curtis is nowhere to be seen. <p>This DVD offers loads of extra goodies for the rabid Carpenter fan. Not only do you get an amazing transfer of the film in widescreen, you get other tidbits to wet your whistle. This special edition version comes with two documentaries about the film, one from 1980, the other made especially for this DVD. There are stills aplenty, a commentary with John Carpenter and screenwriter Debra Hill, tons of ultra cool television and movie screen trailers, a gallery of movie posters and advertisements, and a story board/ scene comparison. When you look at the price for the DVD, you know you're getting a great deal.<p>&quot;The Fog&quot; is great fun, a sort of old time horror tale brought up into the modern age. It's also neat to see John Houseman's introductory monologue outlining the tragedy of the Elizabeth Dane (along with Donald Pleasance's monologue in &quot;Halloween&quot; about Michael Myers, Carpenter knows how to create memorable background narratives!). Hal Holbrook's appearance here as the doomed Father Malone seems surprising, but the actor apparently appeared in another horror film around the same time, called &quot;Rituals&quot; in 1977. In fact, the ensemble cast does a great job in this creepy movie. If you're going to watch &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; anytime soon, you might as well throw in &quot;The Fog&quot; while you're at it. It's worth your time.</p></body></html>

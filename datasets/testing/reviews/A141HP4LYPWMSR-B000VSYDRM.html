<meta name="summary" content=""I Have To Learn How To Keep Smell" ~ The Unholy Quest For The Thirteenth Essence"></head><body><p>`Perfume' released in '07 is one of the most absorbing, unpredictable, titillating, genre free films I've ever seen. It is a stylish and atmospheric period piece, a taut and perverse psychological thriller, a demented romance, and a dark, edgy comedy all rolled into one very surprising movie. If that weren't enough, it's also a parody, allegory, fable and parable. I guess the bottom line is it leaves the audience with so many unanswered questions and possibilities you can make of it whatever you wish.<br /><br />The movie will simultaneously surprise, disturb, repel and fascinate the viewer as it moves upside down and back again on a dizzying rollercoaster journey through the visceral world of odors and scents that defined 18th century France. This film has it all, mesmerizing cinematography, haunting soundtrack, superior cast and an extremely unique storyline that will keep you wondering where it's all headed until the shocking end. Even if you don't like it, you won't forget it. 'Perfume' is a viewing experience extraordinaire, surely destined to become a cult classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="End Zone"></head><body><p>Two millennia hence, there is a barren planet which has at least one small area of fertile land.  To the east lies an ocean.  On the landward side, it is surrounded by an endless wasteland known as the Forbidden Zone.<br /><br />Living in this paradise are apes and humans.  The apes are the dominant life form; the humans are second bananas.  These humans have lost the capacity of speech.  They are uncivilized.  There lives are short, not because of disease, but because the apes are hunting them to extinction.<br /><br />The burgeoning simian society is made up of three classes.  There are the gorillas; their main activity is to hunt humans.  Those not killed are used for research and target practice.  Their General sent scouts into the Forbidden Zone; only one came back.<br /><br />Then there are the chimpanzees; they are the intellectuals, scientists, and veterinarians.  Although the gorilla's believe there is nothing to be learned by studying humans, they do allow the chimpanzees to examine and experiment on them.<br /><br />And lastly, there are the baboons; they are the administrators.  Most prominent, Doctor Zaius is the Minister of Science and The Chief Defender of the Faith.  He is privy to secret scrolls that, if revealed, would expose the truth about man and destroy the apes age of innocence.<br /><br />In the first movie, Taylor's starship crashes; he is captured, but then escapes with Nova into the Forbidden Zone.  In this sequel, Brent is sent to rescue Taylor, but his starship also crashes.  He meets Nova; she has Taylor's dog tags dangling around her neck.  Where's Taylor?  Why, somewhere in the Forbidden Zone, of course!<br /><br />If you have not seen the first move: 'The Planet of the Apes', you should watch it before watching this sequel.<br /><br />Picture: outstanding.  No cropping.  Sound: good.  Volume: typical.</p></body></html>

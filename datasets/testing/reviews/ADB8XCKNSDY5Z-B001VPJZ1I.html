<meta name="summary" content="Issues Hallucinations Raise"></head><body><p>I've always been fascinated by hallucinations.  So this movie naturally appealed to me.  It made me think, "My gosh, what if I'm like this guy and I've had a friend who isn't real all along?"  Holy cow.  Spooky.<br /><br />And the worst thing about it is the guy's hallucinations never go away.  He just has to pretend they aren't there.  What a bummer.  And some of those hallucinations were his best friends at one point too.  Geez.  Star Trek The Next Generation could do six full-length episodes based on the content of this film alone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in psychology, philosophical logic, insanity, or any combination of the three.  It can present you some mysteries, that's for sure.</p></body></html>

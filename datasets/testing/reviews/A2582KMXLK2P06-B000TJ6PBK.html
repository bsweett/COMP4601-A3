<meta name="summary" content="good, but could have been better"></head><body><p>I can't say I'm as thrilled with 1408 as most people.<br /><br />The movie did an INCREDIBLE job in the beginning building up suspense that the hotel room the main character wanted to stay in was full of unexplainable evil, and had a dangerous history of countless deaths over the years of the previous visitors that stayed in the room.  After all the convincing that the guy should NOT stay in the room from Samuel L. Jackson's character, I was anticipating what kind of danger this room would hold.<br /><br />The creepy build up as the guy (who was a book writer by the way) was approaching the room while walking down the hotel hallway was quite good too, with an elevator opening by itself, and flies buzzing over the food on the plates that were sitting on a tray outside a hotel room.  You could sense an enormous danger right around the corner.<br /><br />Once the guy entered the room and started experiencing how insane the room really was, this is where the movie started to lose me... but only a little bit.<br /><br />A nice twist having the Carpenters "We've Only Just Begun" constantly playing on the alarm clock radio, haha.  I love that song.  The history of the band itself was a tragedy, though I don't think the movie directors intended the band to be the focus of the storyline- it was just a random song they chose that was appropriate for the film because of the song title and the beautiful melody of the vocals worked REALLY work in this kind of uncomfortable setting.<br /><br />Anyway, once the guy started getting comfortable inside the room (or rather, UNcomfortable) strange things began to happen.<br /><br />Of course this is a horror movie, so the suspense started off slow and builded gradually.  Once the guy realized something was terribly wrong (and arrogantly thought beforehand that NOTHING would happen to him) he started having hallucinations.  It was a REAL challenge trying to figure out what was real and what was just the guys hallucinations creeping in.  Of course the evil in the room was forcing the guy to have hallucinations quite often about his dead daughter and almost drowning in a ocean (and waking up near a beach) but it was REALLY confusing to me what was really happening and what wasn't.<br /><br />I also feel the movie went a little too far with the creepiness and the hallucinations of the room.  Come on, the ENTIRE room turns into a freezer suddenly as the guy almost freezes to death?  The ENTIRE room floods with water as he almost drowns?  It went WAY too far sometimes and the creepiness went away as a result.<br /><br />1408 is quite entertaining as far as the action is concerned- one great scene right after another, and the film certainly LOOKS really good.<br /><br />Well, the film does make more sense in its conclusion.  I might give this movie a higher rating the second time I watch it, but as it is, it could have been a classic had some exaggerated scenes never taken place.</p></body></html>

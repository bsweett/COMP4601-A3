But when it comes to plot, characterization and the inevitable love interest, it's an entirely different story. Or, rather, it isn't one. And that's a problem. Hamstrung by repetitve romantic and 'character' scenes, the plot never gets off the ground. While this may have been a deliberate choice - a movie-length Act 1 to an endless series of sequels - it just isn't interesting. Rather than coming up with a character-establishing adventure which is thrilling in its own right (as Brian Singer did so well in "X-Men"), writer/director Mark Steven Johnson opts for a more schematic, episodic approach, yoking it all together with tenuous motivations and a ponderous explanatory voiceover. Perhaps aiming for a broader demographic than under-25 males, romance is over-emphasised at the expense of the edgier, darker undercurrents which could have been more interestingly explored. But maybe that wouldn't have helped. For me, there's always something a little silly about these comic book superheroes violently working through their childhood traumas. It works on the page, but on the screen it feels false: perhaps increased fidelity to visual reality demands the same at the emotional level. Ironically, without the antidote of much deliberate humour (used to great effect in "Spider-Man") we end up laughing anyway. As he so often is in other roles, Ben Affleck is spectacularly unconvincing as Murdock/Daredevil. Jennifer Garner makes an appealing heroine as Elektra, so it's a shame she won't be back. Colin Farrell as Bullseye finally gets to release the inner Irish wildman the tabloids keep telling us about, and is the only one who seems to be having fun. Michael Clarke Duncan booms his way through another scary-big-guy performance as the utterly superfluous villain (can anyone even remember what he wanted?). And John Favreau? I just pray he packed on the pounds for the role.</p></body></html>

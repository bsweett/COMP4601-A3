<meta name="summary" content="A classic in it's high definition glory!!"></head><body><p>This has always been one of my favorite series of all time. Especially the first and third installment of this wild, wild ride. So the minute I saw this available for preorder on Blu-Ray I was all over it.<br /><br />The sound is amazing and the picture is clear and beautiful. Notice I dropped a star on the review? It wasn't for the second movie (though the second movie is worth the demotion) but for the graphics being too good. Yes, too good. The graphics were so good you could see the actor's make-up. I don't think the producers expected to see this in high definition so you can really see the make-up and masks when they are trying to disguise or age a character.<br /><br />I'm so glad these came in. We watched them all almost instantly and intend to do that every year or so. I love traveling back and forth through time with Marty and Doc! I'm so glad they put this together in one beautiful package. This has been one of the highlights of my year!</p></body></html>

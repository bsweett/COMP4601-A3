Spoilers, natch. A lot of sand. Two mighty armies face each other and decide to let their top performers do the business. A brute of a man steps forward from Geezers FC. But the Greeks centre forward has had it away on his toes. "Where's Achilles?" bellows Agamemnon, reminding us that this is an age when men were men and sheep were nervous. A soldier is dispatched to a hut where a dirty haired rock God is crashed out with two birds, natch. "Oi, Kills, the boss says get your....self to the pitch, post Hector prompt!" "Leave it out. I've got a hangover." Hair of the dog later, Achilles gets himself to the gig. "I should kick your a**, kid!" Yells Aggy. "Oh, yeah, well your mouthwash ain't makin' it", Achilles comes back with. With a nonchalance Perry Como would envy, Achilles legs it towards the giant. Drop kick. Blinding left 'ook. Our 'enry goes face down. Sorted. Well, that's me sold on the film. I liked classical civilization as a kid and my sister says I've been in the closet longer than a geriatric moth, so it wasn't even a hard sell. <p>Brad Pitt is the business in this film. He plays Achilles as a living spear, and as you know a spear has two sides (this is where the review collapses into pretension.) When he gets a visit from a grieving father, his face crumples as if to say "don't lay this heavy trip on me, dude!" Remember Pitt's mannered performance in SE7EN? He no longer acts like he's got something to prove and the result is entertaining.<p>There's very little I don't like about this film. The sacking of Troy is deflated by an elegiac soundtrack. There's one of those long winded death scenes where they turn down the volume and the cast of thousands suddenly disappear to the John. When Hector exits stage left, a lot of the film's heart goes with him. Not really a criticism, as the same happens in real life when a great warrior checks out. Apart from that, this is one of the best films I've seen. The spectacle and violence is staggering. See it while you can on as big a screen as you can find because I've a hunch it's not going to be around for long, judging by the poor turn out. On a personal note, I'd just like to say I'm a bit of an Achilles. Every day an existential crisis, but will deliver the goods when necessary. No, really. look, Gary does mean 'spearman' in Anglo-Saxon, you know. I got a bright orange mug for Christmas that says so.</p></body></html>

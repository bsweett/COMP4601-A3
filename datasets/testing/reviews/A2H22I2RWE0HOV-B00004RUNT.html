<meta name="summary" content="Luc Besson Delivers Visually Stunning Sci-Fi With A Streak Of Brilliance"></head><body><p>There are two kinds of people out there:  people that love The Fifth Element and people that absolutely hate it.  It is very rare to find someone in the middle.  I know.  One of my best friends absolutely despises The Fifth Element.  This is one of the few thing that we differ opinions on.  Weird.<br /><br />The Fifth Element is definitely not a movie for the casual viewer, I think that is why there are so many out there who hate it.  If you just sat down and popped in the DVD and watched it for the hell of it, you would probably wind up hating it.  It is one of those sci-fi movies like 12 Monkeys or Brazil that you need to watch more than once to get it completely.<br /><br />The Fifth Element in sci-fi and it's a comedy and it's a drama as well.  There are so many things going on in it.  Bruce Willis is a cab driver who happens to be in the right place at the wrong time or vice versa when Mila Jovich plunges through the roof of his cab.  Jovich is the "Perfect Being" left on Earth at one time to stop ultimate evil.  Her return is the result of a crash that left her body completely destroyed except for one hand curled around a contol lever.  She is rebuilt by the government in an effore to stop the ultimate evil that is now  plunging towards the Earth to destroy all of mankind.  Corbin Dallas (Willis) has been reactivated with the military to complete a mission to save the world.  Gary Oldman & Chris Tucker also star as ounlandish characters.  Filled with awesome visual effects and hilarious situations, I can't help but love The Fifth Element.  I understand why one would hate this movie because it could be very confusing and thus considered stupid or annoying if it wasn't watched in the proper frame of mind.  Besson outdid himself here.  Great filmaking.  One Hell of a film.  If you haven't seen it, do so, because it's like nothing you have ever seen before.  If you have and you didn't like it, watch it again.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

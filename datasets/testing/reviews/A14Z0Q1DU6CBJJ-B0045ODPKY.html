<meta name="summary" content="TOO FAST no Character development"></head><body><p>Just because I issued only 3 stars to SALT, doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie. It is definately worth watching and entertaining depending on your taste in movies. Yet, in recent years, Hollywood, screenwriters and movie producers have taken a poor step in the keep em' happy direction. 'Keep em' happy' in the sense of the movie shouldn't stop. The audience paid for action and their gonna get it.<br /><br />Well, the audience is getting action, but at the expense of character development and setup and explanation and just plain mood. There is little to zero effort by the filmmakers to let us know what is going on inside the main character, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />The movie opens up with a violent scene of interrogation as Salt is beaten by N.Korean soldiers, accused of being a spy as she repeatedly assures them that she isn't a spy. The audience affectively wonders if maybe she isn't a spy and she is a victim of mistaken identity. Yet, as the scene breaks and she is escorted back to an American helicopter, released by some high power, the movie then jumps to a scene where we discover, quite unceremoniously that, well, she is a spy and an agent for the U.S. government.<br /><br />This pretty much sums up the entire movie from that point on. There are many twists and turns in SALT, but none of them have an ounce of setup or tactic to keep the audience guessing. Everything is right in your face and gets straight to the action, as if the entire movie viewing world weren't smart enough to be toyed with.<br /><br />None of the twists and turns in SALT, and there are many, garner a gasp, or surprise or any reaction other than, "where's the popcorn?"<br /><br />A good movie that will fall, if it hasn't already, into the pile of movies that will not be thought of ever again, 3 weeks after its video release.</p></body></html>

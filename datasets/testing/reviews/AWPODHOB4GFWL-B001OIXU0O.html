Donna (mother Meryl Streep) was once a wild child and now, twenty years later has a daughter, Sophie who is getting married.  They run a rustic hotel on a tiny Greek island.  The trouble is, Sophie never knew who her father was and neither did Donna.  Sophie figures out it has to be one of three men, so she seceretly invites them while mother Donna invite her two best friends making a perfect excuse to team up three couples during a wedding.  That's it.  Really.<br /><br />Even if you loathe ABBA, you'll find some good humor and songs here amidst the clever (if forced) storyline.  The songs and dancing action are non-stop, although some of the choreograophy could have been improved.  The visuals are stunning and Greece never looked so good.  Sure, some of the songs are goofball and corny, but they  carry the story and for the two male members of ABBA (Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus) to have created such a monster hit is remarkable.  Yes, Meryl Streep really CAN sing as good as the rest of the cast, but Pierce Brosnan is horridly, inexplicably painful to listen to.  No matter.  It's a simple, light-hearted film with lots of good music and good feelings.  The ending is hilarious.  Its just a good time for all.<br /><br />Dolby Surround makes a great mix for the view.</p></body></html>

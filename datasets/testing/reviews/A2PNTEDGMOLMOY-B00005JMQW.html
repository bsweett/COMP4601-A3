Roger Ebert, as I recall, has dubbed "SM2" the best comic-book movie adaption ever made.  Perhaps I was suffering under these high expectations, but I found "SM2" to be a rather pedestrian, "safe" story with weak characters . . . and colossal special effects that almost, but not quite, save the day.<br /><br />"SM2" opens with an imaginative comic-book montage that relates the key moments from the first movie.  As the movie opens, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling mightily to keep his life afloat.  No Bruce Wayne (heir to multi-gazillion dollar Wayne Enterprises), Parker is struggling to make it as a pizza delivery boy, closet superhero, and college student.  He does the superhero thing well, the college student thing poorly (a "genius, but lazy"), and gets fired as a delivery boy.<br /><br />He's also struggling with his romance with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) . . . if romance it can be called.  Mary Jane, now a successful actress, still carries a torch for Parker and suspects that he is Spider Man, but is turned off by Parker's perpetual demonstrations of indifference.  Of course, we know that Parker is "protecting" her by refusing to acknowledge his love for her . . . the scenes of tortured blighted romance between these two don't quite work, as the depression gets weighty (and on several occasions MJ looks sleepy rather than sad).<br /><br />Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) almost steals the show as the tortured genius scientist.  The Spider Man series appears to thrive on tragic villains . . . both the Green Goblin of the first movie and Doc Ock are ambitious-yet-decent men who get corrupted (or trapped, depending on your perspective) by the results of their ambitions.  Maybe it says something about me, but I prefer my villains to be straight villains, a la the Joker from "Batman."  Still, Molina offers several touching scenes and gives the best performance in the movie.<br /><br />Much of the movie is given over to Parker's various struggles with his identity.  These are interesting, but begin to flag as every single aspect of Peter's life falls apart, and there is even a relatively unexplained faltering of Parker's spidey-powers which is apparently connected to Parker's psychic struggles.  Sure, it's great to have a "human" superhero, but this note gets hit a little too often in this movie.<br /><br />The action scenes are fantastic, and are much improved over the first film, which had a slightly cartoonish air to it.  There are several scenes to marvel at, and make the movie worth seeing all on their own.<br /><br />Director Raimi continues one unfortunate trend from the first movie.  Both films are pretty family-friendly -- while there is some violence, it is not very bloody at all, there is virtually no profanity, and the romance does not get beyond a few kisses.  But both films go to great lengths to include shots of voluptuous women in clingy clothing . . . and this is just jarring.  In the first film, we were treated to an inexplicable "hello, nurse!" shot of the lovely Ms. Dunst.  We get more of this in "SM2" -- the worst example coming when a character swoops down over an amazed crowd, and two women gasp in astonishment, mighty bosoms heaving mightily.  Since this was obviously a shot involving great special effects, this is not an accident.  I ask -- why?  I understand that films want to avoid being too saccharine so as to be "uncool," but these cheap scenes aren't the way to go about it.<br /><br />A special effects bonanza and a decent story (as well as its other dubious "features" make "Spider Man 2" a perfect film for boys aged 10-15.</p></body></html>

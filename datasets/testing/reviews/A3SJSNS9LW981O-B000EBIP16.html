The child actors were perfect, the CGI creatures were perfect, the soundtrack... again, perfect (except for the pop music during the credits).<br /><br />A magical fairy tale, a metaphor for "The Greatest Story Ever Told."  Yes, the Gospel story used to be called this, modern critics would strongly disagree with this outdated sentiment. (Perhaps they'll award this title to "The DaVinci Code?") The strongest critics of C.S. Lewis' book and this mostly faithful movie are generally those who hate Christian belief.<br /><br />Yet consider, many stories borrow Gospel elements... including the epic "E.T."<br /><br />If you're not Christian, no harm, no foul!  This fairy tale has adventure, humor, beauty, tragedy and triumph. You WILL enjoy it, and your inner child with smile for days.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, the author of "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

It ranks somewhere in between "Street Fighter" and "Super Mario Brothers." The plot is this: an underground office known as the hive is infected with a strange virus and all the people as well as a few dogs turn into zombies. Yes, it's as pathetic as it sounds, but there's some pretty good action. For the most part, though, the film fails to generate the intense frights that the video games have. The zombies really aren't that terrifying, but the special effects and makeup are very well done. As for the story, it's only mildly interesting and very obviously incomplete. The ending is the best part of the film, gearing audiences up for a possible sequel. I hope they make a "Resident Evil 2." I found myself enjoying this one.</p></body></html>

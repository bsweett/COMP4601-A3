<meta name="summary" content="Rarely does a film come around so effortless in its emotional power and ability to raise our spirits..."></head><body><p>Russell Crowe completely devours his role in this impressive depression era biopic about boxer James Braddock.  His steely dedication to his character comes across with every minor shift of his facial expressions and impresses upon the audience a sense of pain and oppression wrapped in the warmth and appreciation that only a true master of his craft would be able to deliver.  Crowe has truly honed his craft over the past few years and has developed into arguably our finest working actor, and that's a fact I'm more than willing to argue!  Here, in one of his finest performances since his work in `The Insider' Crowe is able to transcend the screen and create a character that the audience can feel for, embrace and comfort and most importantly a character that the audience wants to embrace and comfort.  James Braddock is one of the most likable screen heroes in recent years.<br /><br />The film follows Braddock's fall from the top, a big home and a successful career till he finds himself living in destitution, relying on a prayer to get enough work throughout the week to feed his three children and keep his family warm.  Standing by his side through it all is his loving and supporting wife Mae, played by Renee Zellweger with the same effortless dedication found in Crowe.  Braddock struggles along trying to instill morals and faith in his children despite their horrible circumstances, and that's what makes this man so appealing.  When his son is caught stealing some food he still finds it important to teach his son the difference between right and wrong, making him return the food regardless of how much they could have used it.  They would survive, and they would do that with their morality in tact.<br /><br />Braddock finally gets his chance at redemption when he reteams with his former manager Joe Gould, played with fire and fervor by Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti who is just having a great breakthrough with his career lately.  Although times are hard and Braddock is far from the shape he was in while in his prime he still manages to capture the hearts of those in the community and eventual scores a fight against Max Baer, a ruthless fighter known for killing in the ring.  Mae is opposed and fearful of the outcome but James is determined to follow through and come out the victor.  The final fight is so brilliantly directed and choreographed that I'm still baffled at Howard's exclusion from the official Oscar race.  This is truly his finest film and his most effective performance behind the camera.<br /><br />The supporting cast is top notch as well.  From Craig Bierko's cocky and self-important Baer to Paddy Considine's troubled neighbor, all involved put in a good effort and elevate this film beyond the competition.  One of my favorite supporting performances of the bunch must go to Bruce McGill who just stole his scenes with his infectious anger and selfishness.  Paul Giamatti attacked his role with equal parts passion and integrity and comes off memorable and important, and Zellweger masters the entire look, feel and temperance of the era beautifully, but it's Crowe above all else who deserves the praise and recognition for his powerhouse performance.<br /><br />The uplifting and inspirational story of James Braddock will bring tears to your eyes and warm your heart as you watch this man put his family and his community before self.  Scenes where he offers his daughter his breakfast will leave you choked up and scenes where he pleads for a helping hand with his hat in his hand are especially effective and will have you balling like a baby, at least I was.  Howard and company beautifully capture the time, the place and the heart of this story and deliver one of the finest sports dramas in recent years.  `Cinderella Man' proves to be a complete and utter joy from beginning to end and a most memorable movie watching experience.</p></body></html>

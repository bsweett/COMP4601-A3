<meta name="summary" content="Good Xmas feeling, but OTT sympathy and too many characters"></head><body><p>I just saw this film in the cinema and yeah it is one of those films that everybody who is in the festive spirits will enjoy at the time but that is all really. It is nothing memorable, just sort of a 2 hour xmas time filler to get ya in the mood.<p>The premise is simple. Various persons each have a crisis love situation around xmas time and then eventually it tries to all come together. There is a lot of diversity in the various stories and it is very moochy, kissy, awww---shucks, kind of stuff. So take your girl to see it and I am sure she will be happy for the next few hours after it, but the film does lash on a bit with the whole emotion of love sort of premise that it is born out from.<p>The scenes with the aging old rocker are worth the admission fee alone. Just do not go in expecting a grade A comedy and you will enjoy your two hours.</p></body></html>

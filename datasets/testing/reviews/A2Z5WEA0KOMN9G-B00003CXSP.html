<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing...."></head><body><p>After seeing Gladiator, I thought it was cool that someone was going to do another Roman movie.  The Punnic Wars being one of the key battles for supremacy of the Mediterranean.  Rome had one city standing in the way of its domination and that city was Carthage.  There were three battles.  One of the battles involved a Carthaginian general named Hannibal.<br />This movie had me a bit confused as I was waiting for the climatic scene with the elephants crossing the Alps.  Especially since parts of it were shot in Rome.  Nor did I see any Centurions for that matter.<br />Anyways, I didn't really care for this movie.  It didn't seem like it had a plot other than trying to gross the heck out of the audience.  Whatever.</p></body></html>

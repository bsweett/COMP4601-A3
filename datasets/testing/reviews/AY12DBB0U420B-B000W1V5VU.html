<meta name="summary" content="Hopefully, There's Not An Ocean's Fourteen."></head><body><p>Well, let's see. First there was "Ocean's Eleven" and it was a mildly interesting, mildly entertaining, mildly amusing movie. No big deal, but above average. Then came "Ocean's Twelve" and it was just not a good follow-up. Well, what are you going to do? I've got this three-pack of Ocean movies so I bit the bullet and put "Ocean's Thirteen" on for late night entertainment.. Well, it was back to Las Vegas and that was a relief. Hmmm. The soundtrack seemed to be better and was actually more interesting  than the movie in a lot of places. Well, maybe that's trying to tell you something about the movie. That's right, folks. It was a snorer. The photography was good enough that it actually made Las Vegas look rather good. How do they do that? Have you ever been to Las Vegas? Have you ever looked at the city out and away from the tourist area? Well here I go drifting away from the movie again. I guess that's just how the movie went. Boring. I just couldn't keep my mind on it. My wrist watch seemed to be more interesting. It was something about stealing diamonds and such. And there was a lot of effort devoted to shorting the casino. And there was an earthquake machine. Oh hell, The production values were high and everything was well done. I just wish some more work couldn't have gone into the script. Also, I got awfully tired of watching Brad Pitt feeding his face. Hopefully, there's not an Ocean's Fourteen.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

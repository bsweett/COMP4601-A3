<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Sci-fi"></head><body><p>A dark and futuristic thriller, &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a clever and convincing addition to the somewhat tired and repetitive science-fiction genre. <p>In a flawed society after World War III, emotion and feeling are considered the proeminent elements that lead to the collapse and fall of social order, control and organization. So, the best way to avoid a disastrous scenario is to block or destroy any kind of emotion, building an apathetic, controlled and obedient society. <p>Christian Bale plays a special agent whose mission is to kill anyone who dares to defy the rules and actually gets to feel anything, and his task is well suceeded until a point where he starts questioning his system. <p>Director Kurt Wimmer manages to combine diverse references, from George Orwell`s &quot;1984&quot; to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot; or &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and delivers a consistent and gripping sci-fi thriller, even if its premise isn`t all that innovative. The futuristic society is dark and gloomy as it should, the atmosphere of the movie is dense and claustrophobical enough, the fight scenes are well directed and the plot presents some creativity (the ending, however, is a bit predictable, simplistic and anti-climatic). <p>&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is also a one-man show, where Christian Bale shows (again) that he is an enticing and credible actor, adding depth and presence to a character that could easily have been a cardboard tough guy. <p>Although it`s not as challenging as some of its influences, this cinematic experience is still a strong effort and an unexpected surprise worth discovering.</p></body></html>

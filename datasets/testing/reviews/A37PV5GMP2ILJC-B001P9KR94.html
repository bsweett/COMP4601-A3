"Paper Planes")<br /><br />And so it goes - the backdrop of a Mumbai slum and a popular game show, mixed with a love story, a drama, the exotic melodies of A. R. Rahman and the unmistakable voice of M.I.A.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)<br /><br />1. Boy from the slums grows up the hard way<br />2. He learns from his unforgettable experiences<br />3. Boy meets girl<br />4. Boy loses girl<br />5. Boy finds girl<br />6. Boy loses girl again<br />7. Boy finds girl<br />8. You guessed it!<br />9. Boy risks all to find girl again<br />10. He doesn't take "no" for a final answer<br /><br />This storyline sounds simple, but it's told as a series of flashbacks that will touch your every emotion. When a former street hustler turned tea boy (Dev Patel) inexplicably makes it up the ladder of the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" the suspicious host (Anil Kapoor) calls in the police, who proceed to extract the truth out of him in their own inimitable and sometimes shocking fashion.<br /><br />His sad story is revealed piece by piece, with an explanation of how he knew the answers to all the questions leading up to the big one, and the 20 million rupees.<br />We learn however, that he's really after a much better prize.<br /><br />Poverty, violence, religious intolerance, child abuse, betrayal and revenge are tempered somewhat by love, faith, hope, suspense, humor and music, and this exceedingly clever and well directed drama will have you laughing, crying, squirming and sometimes make you downright outraged.<br /><br />This is one you MUST see, and then buy so you can see it again. Great movie, great casting, great music, great sets, great story - too many "greats" to state here.<br /><br />This isn't one you should miss.<br /><br />Amanda Richards</p></body></html>

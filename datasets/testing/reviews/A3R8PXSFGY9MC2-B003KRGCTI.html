<meta name="summary" content="The Book of Eli"></head><body><p>`The Book Of Eli' explores one idea of what life could be like in a post nuclear war world. Here food, water, energy and books are hard to come by and every day is a struggle to survive. Eli (played by Washington) is known as a walker, who travels across the country (rather than living in a community) trying to subsist on meagre provisions and fighting off lawless robbers just to get by. He only goes into the communities (one of which that is run by the iron handed Gary Oldman) when he needs to recharge batteries or get extra water. He protects a sacred book which is highly sought after by other unscrupulous people and constantly moves west so that he can share his treasure with someone who may know how to do more good with it.<br /><br />This film had a bleak feel to it at first, with muted colours and lots of ash, but it soon began to feel like a cross between a Mad Max film, an action film (due to Washington's `kick ass' character who is more than capable of looking after himself against some rather unsavoury specimens) and a religious allegory about mans folly's and humanity. This was reminiscent of `The Road' which I saw recently and which is based along similar themes, but I found this films story to be more engaging and more uplifting at the end and much prefer it over the aforementioned film. The acting is pretty decent from all involved and Oldman plays his sneering bad guy role perfectly yet again. There is a good twist in the tale and some issues are raised about mans behaviour without moralising or preaching. Some people seem to dislike this film due to it's religious overtones, but to be honest these are pretty slight and are relevant to the story. All in all this was an enjoyable film and if `The Road' put you off post apocalyptic films, but the premise still intrigues you, then this is well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

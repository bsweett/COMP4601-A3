<meta name="summary" content="Weakest of the series but still hits good on Blu-Ray."></head><body><p>A new "cure" has been discovered by scientists and one very special mutant boy with powers to take mutant powers away, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is shocked about the announcement of this new cure for mutations as he wants a peaceful sollutions to the cure. However the mutant community is very upset over this including Magneto (Ian Mckellen) the most who now hates humans more then anything now, Cyclops (James Marsden) feels bad about losing the love of his life Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) died in that water wave but it seems that she has been reborn as Phoenix who has superior powers to her original but she turns out to be dark and dangerous. Magneto decides to declair war against humans while some mutants do like the idea of a cure especially troubled Rogue (Anna Paquin) who wants to be cured of her dangerous powers. It's up to the X-Men like Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Huge Jackman), and new member Beast (Kelsey Grammer) to stop this war before humanity is doomed including mutant-kind.<br /><br />A very weak finale to the major Marvel based movie trilogy! it's quite complex but does have an interesting concept about curing people who are different then any normal human being, replacing Bryan Singer with Brett Ratner is kind of a dumb move. The film unlike the first two are rushed but does introduce some more mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Angel (Ben Foster) and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) but the problem is that the story is prepostorous and the humor goes way too far unlike in the first two. The film does kill off some members of the X-Men but i ain't gonna tell you who for the film isn't as bad as fans proclaimed, it deserves another look since it's a very exciting finale of the series.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray gives off stunning picture and sound quality high theater-esque that will rocket your system on high with some fantastic extras like audio commentaries, Trailers, deleted scenes, Featurettes, a documentary on the trilogy, Still and video galleries, Vignettes and Blogs, and animatics.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly enjoyable film, few extras on the DVD"></head><body><p>Remy the Rat, unlike his brother, father, and extended family, refuses to eat just anything that he finds lying around.  He is a gourmand - sneaking into a human's kitchen to read her cookbooks, trying various mushrooms to try and find the best match to his cheese, etc.  When he ends up in Paris, he finds Gusteau's restaurant in a declining state - savaged by the critic Ego, with a head chef more interested in developing microwave burritoes than in cooking fine food.<br /><br />The biggest hurdle to enjoying this film, as mentioned in the Amazon description, is the fact that this movie is about rats.  Hundreds of them in some scenes.  Ironically, it's the success of the advances in computer animation that makes it difficult - these are not the rodents of "The Rescuers".  They are much more realistic and even I, who have no particular aversion to rats, was a little creeped out by the hyper-realism of Remy's rippling fur.<br /><br />Ultimately the story comes down to the conflict between Remy (and his human avatar Linguini) and the critic Ego.  The resolution of this conflict is so surprisingly satisfying and effective that it redeems the entire film, which is otherwise not particularly original.<br /><br />I can also report that this film works well for children.  Although too dialogue-heavy for really young children, my son inserted the film into his regular rotation starting about age 4.  It's not requested as much as Cars (obviously!) but it's certainly watched more often than Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., or Aladdin.<br /><br />This DVD has a couple of really good extras - the short "Lifted" (which, again, my 4-year-old loves) and the promo short "Your Friend the Rat".  But these two short films - grand total of maybe 15 minutes - is the sum total of all the extras.  There are no making-of featurettes, no director's commentary, etc.  For children, I'm sure they don't care.  For animation/Disney afficionados, this is disappointing to say the least, especially considering that Pixar commentaries are usually very entertaining and informative.</p></body></html>

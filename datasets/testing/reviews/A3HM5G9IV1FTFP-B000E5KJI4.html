And the characters in "Troy" are about as flat and two-dimensional as they come. Vain, horny Trojan Prince Paris (pretty Orlando Bloom) falls for sulky, kept-woman Helen (almost-as-pretty Diane Kruger), which pisses off her husband, Spartan ruler Menelaus, and gives his megalomaniacal brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox, always playing the a-hole) an excuse to invade Troy. Achilles (a buff Brad Pitt) agrees to help, not because he cares, but just because he has a hang-up about having his name in the history books, and Paris' brother Hector (studly Aussie Eric Bana) and father King Priam (a dazed and confused Peter O'Toole) both sacrifice their lives and happiness for the sake of Paris' bratty antics.<br /><br />"Troy" glorifies violence and aggressiveness, while dubiously suggesting that love and family are what's really important. With the exception of maybe Bana's Hector, the "great" and "epic" characters are all arrogant, whiny and selfish brats. All this I could forgive somehow, if "Troy" didn't commit the worst sin of all when it comes to big-budget, Hollywood films ... being boring.</p></body></html>

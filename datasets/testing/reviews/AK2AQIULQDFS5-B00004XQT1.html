<meta name="summary" content="Not just Social Commentary or Satire, its ENTERTAINING!!"></head><body><p>Why do you think movies like this rarely cross the 10 million box office mark, while &quot;Big Daddy&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; easily cross the 100 million mark... One might answer this question like this... &quot;People are Stupid&quot;.. but that's not the answer, it's because people (unlike critics) go to the movies for Entertainment.. If all the critics that raved about &quot;American Psycho&quot; had used the word Entertaining, it would have made about 60-80 million, and if it had Leonardo De Caprio like the producers wanted, it would be up with &quot;Titanic&quot;. <p>&quot;American Psycho&quot; is highly entertaining the whole way through, hysterically funny most of the way through and Ultra-violent for about 10 seconds, you average freddy 27 and Jason 49 have double the blood, triple the body-count and a &quot;Video Premiere&quot; sticker on there video cover. It really is not very violent at all. (am I just getting sicker, or is the world over-populated by cry-babies) If the film had been released in the time it was set, (the 80's) it would be slapped with a PG 13, released alongside &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Running Man&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot;, it would become a cult favourite with pre-teens, and would be lost among the sea of violent 80's videos at your local Blockbuster.<p>As your probably well aware, this film features &quot;SOCIAL COMMENTARY&quot; and &quot;SATIRE&quot;, these three words are scarier to the general public than &quot;PAULY SHORE&quot; and &quot;CHUCK NORRIS&quot;. The Second Roger Ebert and his peers utter those three words the box office drops 85%. (see Box office takes for &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, &quot;The End of Violence&quot; and &quot;Happiness&quot; for example)<p>Just like with every other movie on the face of the earth, if you have the slightest interest in it.. See it, don't be swayed by anything you hear, see it and make up your own mind.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sam Rockwell's "ordinary man" persona makes this movie work"></head><body><p>Earth's energy needs are met with the mining of the moon.  The process is so mechanized, only a single person is needed to operate the mining station.  Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell, is two weeks away from the end of his three year contract staffing the station, and he can't wait for it to end.  "Three years is a long time," he confesses in a message to his handlers on Earth.<br /><br />Sam's only companion is GERTY, an AI presence on the station transported around by overhead railings.  GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) also stands in as a cook, a hairdresser, and a medic.  To give Sam a "sense" of GERTY's mood, GERTY flashes a "happy face," "frowny face," or something in between on a little screen.<br /><br />Sam knows he is tired.  When he begins to see things on the station, he recognizes his mental exhaustion.  And when one illusion causes him to wreak his "lunar tow truck," the story gets very complicated.  He is rescued.  But... there is only him and station-based GERTY.  So who is his rescuer?<br /><br />Sam Rockwell's appearance and actions throughout mimic a person who lives in isolation.  He talks to his plants, is consumed by his hobbies, and yet demonstrates great competence at his job.  Sam wears a worn and dirty pressure suit, shaves when he feels like it, and is happy to have GERTY do the "housework."<br /><br />After things begin to happen, Sam Rockwell, the actor, does a tremendous job staying in character for the rest of the movie.  I can't picture, for example, Harrison Ford or John Travolta starring in Moon.<br /><br />I've watched this film twice, once on the big screen and again as a DVD.  It's great both ways.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

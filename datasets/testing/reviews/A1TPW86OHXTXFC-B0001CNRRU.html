<meta name="summary" content="A Walk On The Razor's Edge Between Life and Death"></head><body><p>"Though not depressing, because nothing this good is, the film is haunting -- a walk on the razor's edge between life and death." Liam Lacey<br /><br />For the first half hour I was confused trying to figure out the characters and how one minute Naomi Watts looked like a lovely woman and housewife, and the next a coke addict. Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu has directed this film which goes between past and present.  As a matter of fact as a critic stated; "the movie is like a mirror broken into hundreds of pieces and put back together one piece at a time."<br /><br />Naomi Watts is one of the most credible actresses of our time. She can become anyone she wants. Sean Penn as well, is IMO, the best actor today. Benicio Del Toro, plays the role of a man who is tormented. A tormented man who has found Jesus but still can't get away from his former life of crime.<br /><br /> Stephen Hunter has said that "21 Grams", which refers to the weight that a body eerily loses at the instant of death," could be construed as the weight of the soul -- is a pure theological argument, playing two theories of grace off each other."  This is a film that sends many messages. What does this all mean? Why do we care and why should we?<br /><br />"21 Grams" begins with an image of birds in an urban landscape, suddenly breaking into helter-skelter flight. That's Gonzalez I&ntilde;arritu's metaphor for chaos, for the possibility that life is random atoms splattered this way and that by other random atoms. That, too, is the narrative strategy: a confusing jumble of seemingly random scenes, beyond the capacity of human organization." Stephen Hunter<br /><br />This is a movie that begs for discussion and pondering. How can we begin to understand the meaning and the message from the lives of three humans as 'screwed up' as these three are by their circumstances? What can we begin to learn?  Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is a director of brilliance and it will behoove us to view all the films he has and will make.<br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 3-30-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MCH5P4">Babel</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N8A9">Amores Perros</a></p></body></html>

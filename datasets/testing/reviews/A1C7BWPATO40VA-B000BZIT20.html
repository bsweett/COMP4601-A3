<meta name="summary" content="Aliens FAN review"></head><body><p>I'm an old time Aliens fan. I use to sit in class and draw aliens on a piece of paper, the aliens found in this movie, not those little green men. Everyone thought I was nuts, but I sure fooled them, I'm crazy not nuts ha!<p>Read further down to have an overall fast rating if you want to watch the rest of the Aliens Trilogy set. This movie is one of the worst in the whole Trilogy. Why? They use about half of the movie to introduce the setting and object and characters of the movie. The action is rare and it is usually exciting for about a couple of moments, than it goes back to being suspense and talking.<p>However, don't be too upset. Aliens, which is part two where they just add an s, which I must say is very clever, is the best in the Trilogy. The action goes from mild, to medium, to a lot, and intense, and also introduces you to the massive alien queen. The graphics is awesome by the way, very impressed. Part 3 or Aliens 111 is plan weak, more or less like the first part, but watch it once and get ready for Aliens Ressurrection and Aliens VS. Predator coming out soon. If AvP sucks I'm no longer their Fan, blah!!!</p></body></html>

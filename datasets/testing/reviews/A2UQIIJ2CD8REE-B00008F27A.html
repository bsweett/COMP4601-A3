<meta name="summary" content="Pure awesomeness!"></head><body><p>A smart-alecky, average joe named Ash, after losing his girlfriend and his right-hand fighting demons in a cabin in the woods, gets spat out of a portal through time and lands smack dab in the dark ages, where two warring kingdoms also struggle with an invading force of pure evil gradually taking possession. They are the ancient ones, and only the chosen one has the power to defeat them. That chosen one, of course, is chainsaw armed, shotgun wielding Ash, AKA Bruce Campbell, vs. the Army of Darkness.<br /><br />Basically, this movie is pure awesomeness! I can still remember the first time I saw it. I luckily had become an Evil Dead fan in a few years earlier thanks to late night airings on the A&E network back when cable TV was much cooler (okay, well, you do have stuff like Walking Dead now, but also about ten million reality shows). However, I had no idea there was a third one being made, and when I went to see Army of Darkness with a friend in 1992, I really didn't realize what it was I was sitting down to see. Then, I saw the prologue. It was Evil Dead 3! And yet, this movie was sooo much more than the Evil Dead films! Okay, it wasn't scary like those ones were (well, they were to me as a kid watching them alone in the dark in the middle of the night), it was more funny. Army of Darkness is definitely more of an action/adventure/comedy than a horror film, though it still shares enough of the look, feel, and even scenarios of the previous two installments to work as a true part 3. And Bruce has really come into his own here, far beyond anything he was in the previous two films. He is the ultimate sarcastic anti-hero with the coolest gear and the best catch phrases! "Army of Darkness" is one of the best, funniest fantasy horror films you're ever gonna find, so make sure you check this one out! You'll see why so many people were excited to see Bruce in each of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. Yes, if you didn't know, Sam Raimi got his start with the Evil Dead trilogy!<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray, well,... some scenes look pretty bad, and this thing is pretty weak on bonus features. I hadn't gotten this on DVD (I had it on VHS forever though), so I was thrilled to get the Blu-Ray, but this "Screwhead Edition" definitely leaves a lot to be desired since there aren't many bonus features either. You get the alternate ending, which is hilarious, but I'm glad it wasn't the ending they used, and you get a featurettes that is mostly about the monster effects. It's pretty cool. But, that's it. Seriously? The Evil Dead movies had better bonus features. Maybe you're supposed to focus on the U-Control and BD-Live enhancements, but while I love bonus features, I don't bother with that stuff, just like I never used to bother with CD-ROM bonus features. Maybe if I had a wifi router, but right now I don't. Anyways, still a must-own movie, so I highly recommend picking this up. It will always been one of my favorites! I even dressed up as Ash for Halloween once, and I hope to do it again in the future (and maybe for some cons)!</p></body></html>

I went to see the film with some friends this afternoon. Much to my surprise I loved the movie from the wonderful casting of Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Helena Bonham Carter to the vibrant colors of the film. Billy Crudup plays Edward Bloom's (Albert Finney) estranged son Will who comes home because Edward is dying. Will wants to try to learn the truth about his father because his father had a reputation for telling tall stories. He wants to get to know his father on a personal level. Based on the Daniel Wallace novel (another book I need to read now that I have seen the film version), director Tim Burton weaves a tale that weaves back and forth from the present moment/reality to the past/fictional(?). Tim does a wonderful job of melding the past and present together. I never thought that Helena Bonham Carter was remotely attractive but I have to admit that she looked beautiful as Jenny, a friend from Edward's past. Alison Lohman looked convincingly as a young Sandra. She did look like Jessica Lange but younger. I loved Matthew McGory as the gentle giant Karl as well as the Chinese twins Ada and Arlene Tai as Ping and Jing. I didn't really think that Billy Crudup had much depth (maybe the depth of a dixie cup) as Will. I guess Tim could have cast someone much worse than Billy, like Billy Zane for example. Otherwise the rest of the ensemble cast in the movie put in outstanding performances. I also loved Steve Buscemi's character Norther Winslow and his transformation which I won't give away. I thoroughly enjoyed "Big Fish". There wasn't a single moment in the movie that I didn't enjoy. I didn't realize until the film first came out that Albert Finney played Daddy Warbucks in the film version of "Annie". I haven't seen Albert Finney in the movies in years. He looked quite different in "Big Fish". Just thought I would share that piece of information.</p></body></html>

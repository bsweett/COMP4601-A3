Yeah, the filmmakers play James Bond type music during the boat chase sequence, trying to establish that connection; and, yeah, the hero, Dirk Pitt, is adventuresome and scruffy like Indiana Jones. But to me, the strongest comparison is with the Michael Douglas character in Romancing the Stone. As a matter of fact, I can't think of an actor that Matthew McConaughey resembles more than Michael Douglas.<br /><br />I hate the comparisons with the novel. On the one hand, if you're going to base a film on a well-known book, make it as close as possible to the original while still maintaining your own vision. But then, on the other hand, why did the author, Clive Cussler, feel it was necessary for McConaughey to look so much like his character, Dirk Pitt, that he made him dye his hair? Wouldn't it have made more sense if the script and McConaughey's acting had resembled the character? But then, nothing about the background of this film makes any sense, even though much of it is covered in the extra features.<br /><br />The one thing that does make sense is Matthew McConaughey's motivation for making this film: to be like Dirk Pitt - i.e., to save the day and get the girl. Now, that's not exactly a brainy, innovative motivation; but then, neither is McConaughey or this film. We've seen it all before: good-natured, typically selfish, treasure hunting male; beautiful, compassionate, socially minded female; handy, faithful, wisecracking sidekick; power-crazed, ruthless villain bent on ruling the world. It would have been nice if they had given this well-worn formula a new spin.<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects of Sahara is the art direction. Visually the film is stunning, especially the locations. The opening sequence in which we take a tour of Dirk's workroom while the credits roll is both interesting and informative.<br /><br />And the dialogue is often entertaining for some light and witty bantering. But then we go off on a plot that is thin and getting thinner; until finally, by the end of the film, everything hinges on keeping a stockpile of disease-causing waste out of an African river that flows into the Atlantic Ocean, thus preventing the entire world from becoming infected and dying. Please.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment for me is that, by the end of the film, no one has changed. That is the earmark of a good story: the hero goes through something that causes him to change, hopefully for the better - but not Dirk Pitt. Even though he faces superhuman challenges that would break a lesser man, none of them seem to affect him. He's the same person at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning. Oh, he saves the day and gets the girl, but...shouldn't there be more? Based on the $69 million return on the $130 million invested, I'd say most movie goers believe there should.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

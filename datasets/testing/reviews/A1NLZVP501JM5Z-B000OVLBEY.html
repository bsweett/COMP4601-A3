<meta name="summary" content="Not bad, Not great, Alright Movie-3.5 Stars"></head><body><p>Wait for the DVD.  Yea I had a good, fun time watching this, but it was definatly not worth 20 bucks(Food, drinks, tickets.  Little bags of candy for 4 bucks!?  Such a ripoff.  Anyways...) its a fun movie, but it tries too hard, and it doesn't know what it wants to be.  For exaample, it has some pretty serious stuff going on(Demons, Satan, Hell) and it tries to make it into a campy Spiderman-like movie with "great" one-liners.<br /><br />The first problem is that Nick Cage is no Tobey Maguire.  I remember telling one of my friends that the movie was great as long as we didn't see Cage's face.  And the most I laughed occured when a baby(Yes a little baby, please people, don't bring little kids into movie theatres!)started crying right after Ghost Rider turned back into Nick Cage.  And I do seperate them because I rooted for Ghost Rider, I really did.  But Nick Cage........well......I wouldn't have been too heartbroken if he got beaten to a pulp.<br /><br />Getting back to the first's paragraphs problem.  So we've got Devils and stuff running around and the movie feels like a horror movie that doesn't want to be a horror movie.  I think this would have been better as a darker "R" rated movie.  Spidey and the Fantastic Four are built for witty one-liners and just campy fun, this movie had a serious feel to it.<br /><br />Now to the Direction.  Its not that great.  MSJ really needs to stop it.  Daredevil was an alright 3/5 movie, but it could have been so much more, just as this could have.  The effects are good, although some segments do feel like a video game.<br /><br />It does have some cool effects and the villains are nasty but Nick Cage brings it down.  I just could not see him as Ghost Rider.  Overall this is a cool, fun, little movie to watch with some buddies but it comes nowhere near the greatness of Spiderman or Batman.</p></body></html>

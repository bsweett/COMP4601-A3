<meta name="summary" content="A Search for a Lost Girl"></head><body><p>This film is set in 1868 Texas. Uncle Ethan visits his relatives in a dry dusty land. Ethan wears a grey coat and blue trousers. Ethan remarks about Martin's ancestry as if it was unusual. He gives a locket to Debra. Ethan's double eagles are freshly minted. [This could signify he rode with the James Gang.] Visitors drop by with news of a cattle theft. Could it be the feared Comanches? The house appears quite large inside, and well furnished. The posse follows the trail of the stolen cattle only to find them butchered. Was it a ruse to draw the armed men away? Whose home would be attacked? The returning men find fire, ashes, and bodies. Ethan, Brad, and Martin set out to search for those who attacked the family and rescue the kidnapped girls. The small group of white men are able to fight off a much larger group of Indians. Then they separate.<br /><br />The film follows Ethan and Martin on their search for Debbie. Brad attacked the Indians in revenge for Lucy's death. They return to the Jorgenson's home. Martin wants to join Ethan in the search for Debbie. [A $1,000 reward seems much too high.] A letter brings news to the Jorgenson family. [This is played for laughs.] We see a herd of buffalo, then a troop of cavalry. An Indian camp was massacred. Martin is now a widower. Ethan doesn't find Debbie at the Army post among the survivors. They continue to search. An old Mexican sells them news of Chief Scar. Has Debbie grown up? There is drama in the meeting, and the attack on Ethan and Martin. Ethan has made a holographic will making Martin his sole heir. Debbie is dead to him.<br /><br />Ethan and Martin return to the Jorgenson's home. They are wanted men for the deaths of Futterman and his men. Their daughter is set to be married to a man who is not her first choice. Martin and Charlie fight. The Cavalry arrives with news about Chief Scar being nearby.  What are Ethan's plans for Debbie? Martin wants to rescue Debbie. They attack the Comanche camp successfully. "Let's go home." Will there be a happy ending for all?<br /><br />John Wayne does not appear to be happy in this film. Was it changed much from the book? What about the charges against Ethan and Martin? What will happen to Debbie? Will Martin marry Miss Jorgenson? These loose ends are not tied up, as if they ran out of time or money to finish this film. What was the significance of Mose, a man with alopecia? This film is an example of myth-making, or revisionist history from Hollywood. I don't believe Indians would steal cattle only to kill them; its not cost-effective and goes against human nature. This novel was serialized in `The Saturday Evening Post', a popular literary magazine of that time. Its stories were often filmed.</p></body></html>

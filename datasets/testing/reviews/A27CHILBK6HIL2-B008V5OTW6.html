I don't remember the last time a film grabbed me and wouldn't let go like Munich did. Eric Bana plays Avner, who is hand picked by the Israeli government to track down and kill the Palestinian leaders of the terrorist group who organized the 1972 Munich hostage killings of eleven Israeli olympic athletes. Avner is a family man, he loves his wife and cannot wait for her to give birth to their baby daughter. He is then taken away from his family to fulfill this mission. He is the head of a group of five men, all with different specialties, and they must one by one track down and kill the Palestinian terrorist leaders. The film is a deep dark look into the nature of man, and you will be deeply moved by the actions taken and the journey that Avner completes. Spielberg gives the audience a lot to chew on, there are many different viewpoints expressed, but it's not solely a political film. Avner is a real character that people can identify with. His moral descisions and actions all paint his character for the audience to connect with. Geoffrey Rush turns in another brilliant performance as the man who secretly employs these men, and he represents the government's viewpoint in the film. All he wants is for revenge to be had. Avner enters this game with a similar viewpoint, he wants justice to be had for these brutal executions, but his character grows throughout the film and he comes to realize that violence as a tool is futile in the war to stop violence. We see two opposites in character with Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush, two people who will never see anything in the same light, and this gives way for the brilliant ending to the film. The film itself is made as if Spielberg spent months and months planning it, however they started filming in July of 2005 and had a December 23rd release date. That is simply amazing that a team of filmmakers were able to make a film this good in that amount of time. The scene structure is absolutely amazing. Spielberg will build tension within the scene by using a continuing shot and will not cut away. The camera tracking is unbelievable. Instead of having three or four cameras for one scene, he will use one. The camera will dolly, zoom, pan, and tilt to show the scene, but never cut away. The camera style is almost Hitchcockian, and it works to perfection. Every assassination that is carried out is intensly thrilling, and you will be coiled up in your seat for the entire film. It is gripping, emotional, intelligent, and raises enough questions for the audience to ponder. This is a master filmmaker at his best, the film is visually breathtaking and emotionally stunning.<br /><br />ACTING: Who knew Eric Bana would hold a leading role in a film like this, and pull it off with perfection? I don't see how he cannot get a nomination for this role, he was simply captivating. He handled this huge role and made it seem real, you feel every emotion that Avner is going through and that really helps the film's overall impact on the audience. The rest of the cast turn in great ensamble performances, and Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as always. The cast is perfect, no possible way it could have been better.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg knows exactly what's needed to create the perfect tone, and he can switch from heartwarming to disturbing in a blink of an eye and make it seamless. This film is gritty, violent, emotional, and will make you ask serious questions about the state of global conflict and the nature of man. This 2 hour 45 minute film will seem like an hour because there is not one dry spot in the entire movie, the audience is involved from the very opening to the closing credits. The film doesn't feel like a history lesson, it is an intense thriller made masterfully by Spielberg. It will stay in your mind long after you see it.</p></body></html>

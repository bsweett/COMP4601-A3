<meta name="summary" content="Philosophical fun"></head><body><p>An entertaining, high-energy film in which characters crash off each other like balls in a pinball game, spinning each other's lives into new trajectories.  This film tackles some serious issues but refuses to take itself seriously, thereby remaining light and entertaining at all times.  To what extent are our lives ruled by chance, and to what extent are our fates determined by personality?  Watching the different versions of Lola's run through town, we can see that the lives of various secondary characters take dramatically different turns depending on such apparently innocuous details as whether Lola runs by at a certain point in time or five seconds later.  Yet the fate of Lola and her boyfriend, Manni, always seem to be the same.  This is a rewarding film whether you or in the mood to ponder such issues or just to be entertained.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jason Statham is rendered dull in this lame sequel"></head><body><p>With a super packed ending consisting of a special effect plane instead of a real plane, this movie rocks (sarcastic laugh) No, to tell you the truth, Transporter 2 is a big messy silly actioner with no brains. Jason Statham (The Italian Job 2003, Snatch) returns to the role of Frank who is now helping transporting a kid of a wealthy man, played by Matthew Modine (Vision Quest, Any Given Sunday) and his wife, played by Amber Valetta (Hitch) When Valetta asks The Transporter to take her son to the doctor the next day, Statham agrees with the proposal, then when he drops off the kid things get a little array when he fights his way out, with the kid from the bad guys who want the boy. Then, the bad guys take the boy from him and Statham finds out later, after all those fights and a long boring chase scene that the main bad guy, Chiani, played by Alessandro Gassman, has a virus that he injected into the boy and everyone around the boy, excluding his mom and dad get infected and it kills all of them. The first Transporter was good, wasnt the best movie but it was decent...this, the sequel, is crap. The action scenes, when not sprinkled with special effect, are ok...the physical contact fight scenes...especially when Statham uses a fire hose and the beginning scene where he gets car jacked was a chuckle but this just doesnt cut the ice. Also starring Jason Flemyng (Snatch, Deep Rising), Keith David (Reqiuem For A Dream, The Thing) and Katie Nauta who wields two guns while wearing bearly nothing. Alessandro Gassman's acting was another bad part in this movie....keep the frickin' shirt on buddy.</p></body></html>

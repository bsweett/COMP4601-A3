The actors/actresses look like amateurs, much of the effects look very unrealistic, I never really understood the plot behind the movie (but I have a feeling it's anything but deep), Dracula looks like a "pale" Gary Oldman-wannabe (Oldman did the best Dracula ever by the way, so this guy should never have tried to copy him, it looks pathetic), you realize this project had the money, but no talent, no talent at all (rather impressive) - and of course I bought the darn thing without seing it first, my mistake. It's actually so boring I haven't seen the end of the movie yet, and I don't care who wins, who dies, nor how... The mummy was better, but rather thin that one as well - the mystery to me is how this director finds his producers and cast, these movies cost a fortune to make - but in my opinion he totally fails.</p></body></html>

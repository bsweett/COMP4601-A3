<meta name="summary" content="the conclusion of the saga (3.5/5)"></head><body><p>i found this concluding chapter of The Matrix trilogy much better than<br />the second installment and probably better than the first one.this one<br />was more coherent and made more sense story wise.plus there aren't as<br />many drawn out repetitive,and absurd fight scenes.this movie is<br />actually pretty exciting,particularly during the showdown between Zion<br />and the sentinels.but this movie,like the other two,borrows heavily<br />from other sources,most notably the Alien franchise,and the biblical<br />parallel is once again very strong.there are some logic gaps,and things<br />that don't make sense,but at least the story wasn't as muddled.to<br />me,this was the most satisfying of the trilogy.for me,The Matrix<br />Revolutions is a 3.5/5</p></body></html>

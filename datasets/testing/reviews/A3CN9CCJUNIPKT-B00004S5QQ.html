There are a lot of contenders -- "Seven Samurai," perhaps -- but it's hard to beat the magic of this grand Hollywood war-noir classic, with its snappy dialog, gauzy black-and-white cinematography and delicious acting.  Plus, it's a great propaganda flick and historical timepiece. Yup, pretty much my favorite.  One downside: I miss the days when you'd see movies like this in the theater and actually have a communal cultural experience with other human beings.  Still, now that I have it on DVD, I looking forward to enjoying it for years to come. We'll always have Bogie and Bacall.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="De Niro can't "de"-rect"></head><body><p>At 2 hours and 47 minutes this thing plods along and the worse thing about the DVD package is the extras are only "deleted scenes" meaning they actually edited this movie? What was it originally, an over 3-hour epic?<br /><br />I was pleading telepathically for Matt Damon's character to morph into Jason Bourne and start slapping people to wake up out of their comatose-like acting. Despite heavy hitters such as Angelina Jolie's lips, William Hurt's wig and Alec Baldwin's gut showing up to gain screen time, apparently Robert De Niro was too lazy to actually lift himself from a chair during two scenes in this movie.<br /><br />A complete mess at attempting to "explain" the CIA's rise in a movie. maybe it does depict accurately how the CIA started, works and goes about its business. All I can say on celluloid it's not worthy of watching unless you enjoy paint drying while waiting for a bus that never comes. Excuse the analogy but this topic is better served in book form or as a legit documentary. As a movie, this thing is a total snoozer.</p></body></html>

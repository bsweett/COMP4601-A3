<meta name="summary" content="A Rare Film That Is Historically Accurate & Entertaining"></head><body><p>MOVIE: This film is about the story of Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew on the HMS Surprise. The film takes place during the times of the Napoleonic Wars at sea. What makes this film a winner is the fact that it was able to stay incredibly historically accurate and still maintain is entertaining value. Most movies that try to be historically accurate tend to fail miserable due to them being . . . well . . . boring! Take Gods and Generals for example. Anyway, the film documents the adventures and journeys of this ship as it fights for their country and themselves. I guess what made this movie so exciting was the incredible sound and visuals. At $150 million, the movie was no cheap fare to make. Unfortunately it did horribly at the box office and was the reason that the movie was split between three different distributors (20th Century Fox, Universal, and Miramax). What really makes this film so enjoyable is the fact that it has such a fantastic ensemble cast. As you've expected, Russell Crowe is the star of the show, but without the supporting cast his performance would have gone to waste. A terrific film, one of the best of its kind, and something that you can take with you to history class and to your home theater.<p>VIDEO: The video of this DVD is incredible. Your HDTV will certainly get its run for the money, mine sure did. This two disc set comes in anamorphic widescreen in a 2.40:1 ratio.<p>AUDIO: Here you get an amazing DTS and Dolby 5.1 mix that will knock your socks off. The sound of this movie is incredible and needs mixes like these.<p>PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I have the two disc edition. I personally feel that the only reason why we have the choice of one disc and two disc editions is because of the poor performance at the box office. So in order to get as much money as they could, they put two discs in a fancy shmancy box and charge a lot for it. Then they give the option of a disc with absolutely nothing on it so buyers of the two disc set feel special. Honestly the extras are nothing to bananas over. It's not a great amount and they are not all that special. In this set you get trailers and tv spots, 70 minute behind the scenes documentary, how they adapted the movie from the books, moviemaking secrets, sound design featurette, cannon demonstration, 6 deleted scenes, multi angle scenes, and a split scene vignette. When someone buys something they always want it to be the better of its kind. So knowing how the human mind works, Fox released a bare bones release and a normal two disc set wrapped all pretty and slapped a big price tag for that. Naturally the consumer will buy the better set. I don't see why the consumer has to suffer just because their marketing failed during the theatrical release. The set is good though, I'm just complaining about how they released it and priced it, that's all.<p>Movie Score: (4 Stars / 5 Stars)<br />DVD Score: (8 / 10)</p></body></html>

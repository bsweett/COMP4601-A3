<meta name="summary" content="So-so, Entertaining, Light-Hearted, and Goofy Version of Marvel Comic Adaptaion"></head><body><p>Now there are so many films based on comic books or graphic novels, and Marvel has been playing important role in this trend, with the varies results.  And another one has arrived.  OK, now I've seen it, and I can tell you there are two good news about the live-action filmed version of 'Fantastic Four'<br /><br />1) The film doesn't take itself seriously.  Though the film starts from the "Episode I" of FF, Mr. Fantastic, Human Torch, The Thing, and Invisible Woman, the film's tone remains very light-hearted, making a good contrast with 'Batman Begins' or to some extent the same Marvel's film 'Daredevil.'  'FF' does not reach the lofty height of 'Batman' rightly knowing that's not where it should go, but it is at least much better than seeing how Halle Berry became Catwoman and received a golden Razzie award personally.<br /><br />In 'Fantastic Four' we see one failed experiment in outer space turn the five people into rubberball, fireball, rock, invisible woman, and iron man, and they worry so much about their changed bodies, but wait a while.  They soon discover what they can do with their newly acquired ability, and then actions start in the good, old fashion, that is, the good vs the evil.<br /><br />The story is weak, and sometimes 'disasters' happen because of our heroes' own carelessness (which undermines the plot), but the characters are interesting, and Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are all good, especially Evans as Johnny Storm.<br /><br />2) Other good news is that the CGI enhansed actions are reasonable if not perfect.  One of the best effects is huge body of Ben Grimm and his craggy skins, which are much more convincing than those of 'Hulk.'  Equally good is the effects of Human Torch, and added humor (mostly goofy kind) is helpful especially when we see these two characters exchanging some dialogues during their frequent squabble.<br /><br />Less successful is the romance part.  It only slows down the story, and Gruffudd and Alba has no chemistry between them that would make us care their love story.  And some CGIs, those of Mr. Fantastic in particular, need better technique for sometimes the live-action background and CGI created hands or legs, of which movement looks often awkward, just don't merge together.<br /><br />Light-hearted 'Fantastic Four,' often silly and goofy, intentionally goes against the grain, the trend of the comic hero with darker side like 'Spider-man' (another Marvel creation).  I am afraid that 'FF' is too light-hearted, but still enjoyable if you don't expect too high standards.  If you need to see better version of film about four characters with superpower and one bad guy, see 'The Incredibles.'</p></body></html>

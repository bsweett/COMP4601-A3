We see and feel a lot here and this film is in no hurry to rush to the climax as one is very likely to be hooked after the first scene.<br /><br />WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />'MASTER AND COMMANDER: The Far Side of the World', Directed by Peter Weir is a film based on two novels of the same names, set in the Napoleanic War by author Patrick O'Brian. Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, of the HMS Surprise. Aubrey a is an able, strong and popular commanding officer with a mission. He is in pursuit of a rather mysterious and powerful phantom privateer of the French navy - the Acherson. The search takes them to the South Seas and around Cape Horn.<br /><br />From the beginning, the film has a sense of adrenaline about it as we are presented with a few quiet moments before a battle with an unseen enemy. The ship, the sea, the men and the suspense of the unknown are thick throughout the opening scene which effectively sets the tone for the entire film.<br /><br />--* THE MAJOR PLAYERS *--<br /><br />Russell Crowe  - Captain Jack Aubrey<br /><br />Paul Bettany  - Dr. Stephen Maturin<br /><br />Billy Boyd  - Barrett Bonden<br /><br />James D'Arcy  - 1st Lt.

No featurette, absolutely nothing. I suggest if you want these features that you carefully check which edition of this fine film you are getting as there are at least 7 DVD releases listed at Amazon.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: ANOTHER TERRIFIC FILM THAT I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T LIKE<br /><br />This film really delivers on a number of levels; action, suspense, natural wonders, good music and most of all, the big payoff for watching it through to the end. We do finally discover whether the Captain is driven by blind pride [as his closest friend the doctor suggests to him] or grim determination in the face of England's enemies at a desperate hour.</p></body></html>

It's before all a fiction but the plot is well balanced. The only thing I didn't like is the 2 hours because It's pretty slow moving.For sure don't get this movie because you expect a true story or because you want to be scared.It's more kind of &quot;investigation &amp; suspense&quot; movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino is a textbook sadist"></head><body><p>It finally hit me while watching Basterds that QT is a complete and utter sadist. The best performance here is the film's main sadist, whom the director clearly identifies with to a large degree. QT delights as usual in showing extreme violence in great detail. Someone please tell me how Aldo Raine calmly eating his lunch while watching a man be beat to death with a baseball bat is in any way not as reprehensible as any Nazi killing. Please. The Nazis had their own self-justifications, too. Torture is torture, whoever's doing it.<br /><br />It's that kind of juvenile delight in others' pain that makes Tarantino happy. It's in almost every film he's done, with the exception of Jackie Brown, which along with Pulp is the only thing he's done that moved me intelligently. You can almost hear him salivating behind the camera as the sick stuff pulled from his warped sense of justice plays out on the screen. How is that masterful? Coppola is masterful; watch how the Godfather's violence plays out, then watch a QT film. That's the difference between art and psychosis, to my eyes.<br /><br />I'm sure the fanboys will dump all over this opinion, but then again, look at the folks who worship QT...and worship is the right word. The ones I see here in Austin, and there are plenty, seem to be just like their hero: the kind of guy who got beaten up in high school and gets revenge in delighting in others' suffering, real or cinematic. I saw the first few QT film fests he did here, and while his pre-screening talks were often interesting (and painfully hyper-speed; sniff sniff, hello Peru!), there was also a sense of a guy who thinks film is reality and that the rest of life is just prelude to the lights going down. Perhaps that's why he can't see how sadistic his own vision is.<br /><br />He found his perfect subject here, for who can complain about revenge on the Nazis? Yet it all feels to me no less disgusting than what the Germans were up to. Listen to Raine's first speech; that's promotion of genocide, pretty much. And the graphic displays of scalps being cut off? Come on, what exactly is the point of that except delight in other's suffering? Hate begets hate, and any truly mature filmmaker seeks redemption not in revenge, but in understanding and transcendence. Or, maybe I'm just wrong and it's all about an eye for an eye. Make them all suffer! In hi-def, with lots of blood and screaming! Yay team!!<br /><br />Yes, Quentin is a technically fine director, and the opening scene is good (though hardly the revelation many claim; there are plenty of war films with many more gripping scenes than that). But the whole Raines subplot is entirely unnecessary here, and seems to exist only to let QT and his fanboys delight in onscreen torture, supposedly justified by the other side's own atrocities. The main story is much more interesting, and if it alone had been the whole movie, it would be a much finer work. But Tarantino needs to torture people. He lives for it. And that's sadism, pure and simple.<br /><br />I did very much enjoy the performances of Waltz and Laurent, and the main story is decent enough (if totally unbelievable; Hitler brings all his top guys to a little theatre in France with almost no security outside? Sure.). But add that pointless subplot and the film becomes over two and half hours long, and that felt about 45 minutes too long to me. Take out the gleeful violence and suddenly it makes sense. But I guess that's not what Quentin's audience signs up for; they love the blood and gore and he's more than happy to deliver.<br /><br />He's got the skills, sure, but for my money he needs to dump the incessant violence and focus on character and plot development instead of seeing how many graphic killings he can insert into every film.</p></body></html>

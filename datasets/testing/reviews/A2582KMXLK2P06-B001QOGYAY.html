<meta name="summary" content="my goodness- a classic!"></head><body><p>The Lovely Bones tells the brilliant story of a normal girl just entering her teenage years who was murdered in the basement of a cornfield, and what it's like when she explores the in-between period of heaven and life.<br /><br />Throughout the film, you will be sitting there on your sofa totally amazed and guaranteed to express a TON of emotion such as crying and feeling sympathy, and even wondering yourself whether dying is anything like the way the girl in the film witnesses it.<br /><br />The special effects showing the magical places in between heaven and life are absolutely *spectacular* and gorgeous, constantly shifting from snowy mountains to beautiful country fields to spectacular lakes and enchanted forests... it's truly a sight to behold and really enhances the story because the atmosphere grabs ahold of your personal inner feelings and refuses to let go.<br /><br />Whenever the switch occurs from the real world to the pre-heavenly area of land, it's always a wonderful surprise when you're treated to how the girl communicates with, not only some of the people she meets there, but how she tries to reach out to her family. It seriously makes you wonder if any of this can even be possible.<br /><br />Now the OTHER part of the storyline is the real life situation involving the cops and the girls family trying to track down the killer, who coincidentally happens to live right down the street from the family's home. Throughout the film you will see the killer try to do everything in his power to avoid getting caught. You can probably guess what happens by the conclusion, but it's the WAY it happens -and the way everything builds with a ton of feeling (and magic) attached to every scene- that left me feeling totally satisfied.<br /><br />The acting is nothing short of astonishing from all the actors, actresses and children, the storyline is easy to follow and keeps your attention constantly, and the film is just really fantastic in numerous areas. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

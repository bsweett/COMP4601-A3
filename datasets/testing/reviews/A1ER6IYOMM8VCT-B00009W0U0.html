<meta name="summary" content="NOT BAD DISTURBING AND CREEPY FILM WITH SOME HUMOR! 3 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>This is one of the few movies I've watched lately that gave me the creeps. This is a horror film with plenty of wacked out and disturbing characters! The film starts out with the strangers on a deserted road trick, but it soon turns into something resembling the 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre, before going into an even more demented satanic zombie flick!<br /><br />The film did hold my interest for the most part...maybe the sexy little wacko Baby was responsible for that?! I've seen better, but I've seen so much worse and Zombie and the rest of the cast sure do pay homage to the old time horror films. You can find this one pretty cheap and if you like a little twisted gory horror,this might be for you!</p></body></html>

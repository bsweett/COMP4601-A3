<meta name="summary" content="The Rundown on Rock's new action film!"></head><body><p>The Rock goes from bodyslamming his opponents in WWE rings to doing likewise to the bad guys in The Amazon in his second major starring role. Unlike his role in the somewhat boring "Scorpion King", a prequel to "Mummy Returns" with Rock reprising his role from that franchise, the big guy actually gets to do some acting in this one. He's no Al Pacino here but he does have some decent acting chops. He seems to be going that Vin Diesel route here. <p>The Rock is essentially a loan shark who is sent in by his boss to retreive a wise-cracking treasure hunter named Travis Walker (Sean William Scott). As one might guess, Walker is rather hesitant to give up his mission and go home. Enter Hatcher (Christopher Walken), a mean-spirited overseer of sorts who breaks his deal with Rock's Beck and this results in battle after battle. Along the way, the mismatched duo comes in contact with hyper monkeys, exploding jeeps, and a rebel group that just happens to be led by the local bartender. <p>"The Rundown" has received some rather overblown reviews likening it to such classic buddy comedies as "48 Hours" and calling it one of the best action films ever. Reviewers like this seem to be so hypnotized by the "star power", thus ignoring a lot of other elements. Peter Berg gets props for the presentation. The action sequences look amazing but there are a lot of other things that aren't done so well. Looking beyond the glossy packaging, the script is thin. The comedic pairing of Rock and Scott is cute at times but nowhere near on the level of Nolte and Murphy or Gibson and Glover. Walken is always gonna be good but this is not one of his better roles. He is having fun with the role and so are we in watching him but he made for a much effective villian in the five minutes he appeared in "True Romance" then in the more than hour we get him here.<p>If you know what you are getting into, "The Rundown" is a real fun movie. I was not expecting too much from The Rock here but he surprised me. There is nothing "landmark" about this film though Berg's visual flare makes for something different. This movie is for the most part, a more visually-developed version of Deran Sarafian's "Gunmen" with a much more high-profile cast.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Harry to Peter: You Killed my Father, Prepare to Die!"></head><body><p>No, Harry Oswald doesn't go around quoting "The Princess Bride," or referring to Inigo Montoya's famous quest to revenge his father's death by a six-fingered man. However, he blames Spiderman for the death of his father (AKA the Green Goblin). He'll do anything to avenge his father, and that includes making a deal with Dr. Octopus.<br /><br />That, and several other excellent subplots help make Spiderman 2 the best screen adaptation of a comic book series. I argue that it is better than best-of-show in a genre, and can be placed in the echelons of great movies overall.<br /><br />Although incredible effects help create a real Spiderman, the movie excels because of the humanity of Peter Parker.<br /><br />Peter is in love, but isn't willing to tell Mary Jane. He uses Spiderman as his excuse even though it is old fashioned fear of commitment and rejection that are at play. Any teenager or young 20s man has felt that angst, and so we relate to Peter.<br /><br />Peter loves his Aunt May and the late Uncle Ben, and feels heavy guilt for Uncle Ben's death. It was Peter, after all, who let the thief who later killed Ben escape. The relationship between Aunt May and Peter is like a grandmother and grandchild, and is believable.<br /><br />Mr. Jameson is the least believable character, and the most caricatured. Snapping quickly at any opportunity to malign Spiderman's reputation, he acknowledges that Spidey's apparent retirement causes an increase in the crime rate.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />Peter tries to set aside his Spiderman persona to forge a real life. Too often, he found Spidey interfering with his ability to keep his word, to be on time, keep his grades up, to earn money and to keep and grow relationships.<br /><br />After soul-searching, he quits, and tries a post-Spidey lifestyle. He watches as police rush by a few times. When Peter saves a baby in a burning building without the assistance of super powers, only to learn someone remained in the building and died, he knows he could've done something.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Harry Oswald introduces Peter to his hero, physicist Dr. Octavius. Dr. Octavius is working on a project that can revolutionize and resolve the world's energy problem. During a demonstration, the experiment goes awry. Spiderman launches into action, and saves the day. Unfortunately, Dr. Octavius's beloved wife dies in an explosion, and the Dr. himself finds that the robotic arms he used to help with the experiment have fused to his nervous system.<br /><br />Raging against Spiderman for, as he believes, killing his wife, Dr. Octavius seeks revenge. Concurrently, he tries to rebuild the dangerous experiment. He needs rare materials, and deals with Harry, who also wants revenge. If Dr. Octavius captures Spiderman, Harry will give him the material.<br /><br />When Harry pulls out a dagger, ready to kill the bound up Spiderman, he pulls off the mask, and everything changes. How can his best friend be Spiderman?<br /><br />All of the while, Peter is trying to make ends meet. The cantankerous Mr. Jameson hires Peter to photograph a social event involving John, his son, a famous astronaut.<br /><br />It turns out that John is seeing Mary Jane, and becomes engaged to her. Peter's heart sinks, and he tries to talk her out of it and back into a relationship with him. MJ counters that she and Peter have no relationship to return to. It is over, and Peter knows it.<br /><br />When Dr. Octavius kidnaps MJ, and tells Peter to tell Spidey to meet him, Peter must decide if Spiderman must exist to save MJ, the world, but in doing so, lose MJ's heart.<br /><br />What will Peter choose? The love of a woman, or her life? It is an impossible choice, and replete with danger either way.<br /><br />The transition between comic book and movie screen has never been as smooth. Ang Lee's "Hulk," had no depth, just as Christopher Reeve's "Superman." Fun? Yes, but neither were great movies. "Spiderman 2" is a great movie.<br /><br />We forget who are the actors. Kirsten Dunst as girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson is fantastic, being beautiful and ordinary simultaneously. Rosemary Harris looks as much as like Aunt May as anyone could. Finally, Tobey Maguire is so perfectly cast as Peter Parker, that all is seamless.<br /><br />I fully recommend Spiderman 2. I'm ready for "Spiderman 3," and hope the producers realize that there is enough good Spiderman material to make another five movies as good as this.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></body></html>

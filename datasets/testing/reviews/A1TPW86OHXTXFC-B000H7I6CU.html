Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way.<br />Lightning McQueen: How do you mean?<br />Sally: Well, the road didn't cut through the land like that interstate. It moved with the land, it rose, it fell, and it curved. Cars didn't drive on it to make great time. They drove on it to have a great time. "<br /><br />'Route 66, Get Your Kicks on Route 66'- remember that song that solidified the reason for driving to the west on that great highway? As we all knew, the interstates took over and Route 66 is driven only for pleasure, now. Wait a minute, isn't that what driving and vacations are supposed to be?<br /><br />I am usually not an animated film fan, but I think I have been through a conversion, If I wanted to understand my three year old grandaughters fascination with someone called 'Lighting McQueen' I realized I had better get with it. She and I watched this movie, and I fell in love with the story, the animation, the color, the depiction, the soundtrack and the characters. Sally and Lighting' McQueen, Mater, and Doc. Who could better convey life's lessons than these cars in a movie directed towards all of us? Not only is this a knock-out movie but it kept my interest for two hours. My granddaughter told me "there are some scary parts, gramma, but they go by fast', and she was correct. The Director knows his stuff and the animators and illustrators and the entire kit and caboodle put together a story so well done that this is a must see.<br /><br />he cast of characters could not be better, what voices, what style, they convey the feel of the story with such joie de vive.<br /><br />Owen Wilson .... Lightning McQueen (voice)<br />Paul Newman .... Doc Hudson (voice)<br />Bonnie Hunt .... Sally Carrera (voice)<br />Larry The Cable Guy .... Mater (voice)<br />Cheech Marin .... Ramone (voice)<br />Tony Shalhoub .... Luigi (voice)<br />Guido Quaroni .... Guido (voice)<br />Jenifer Lewis .... Flo (voice)<br />Paul Dooley .... Sarge (voice)<br />Michael Wallis .... Sheriff (voice)<br />George Carlin .... Fillmore (voice)<br />Katherine Helmond .... Lizzie (voice)<br />John Ratzenberger ....<br />Mack/Hamm Truck/Abominable Snow Plow/P.T. Flea Car (voice)<br />Joe Ranft .... Red/Peterbilt (voice)<br />Michael Keaton .... Chick Hicks (voice)<br /><br />The theme of the movie is winning at any cost and life's little diversions that teach us well. Lighting McQueen is the star, but each and every character is integral to the plot and the movie. We all know that we can't have everything, but a little bit is ok!<br /><br />The soundtrack was scored by Randy Newman and it is fabulous. The music lifted me up and I recognized Randy Newman's stamp all over. Rascal Flatts sings the hit "Life Is a Highway," The highlight is Sheryl Crow's "Real Gone". John Mayer sings the theme "Route 66", and Chuck Berry's version is also included. "Opening Race," and "Bessie" does George Thorogood a turn. Randy Newman delivers a wonderful song in" Our Town," sung by James Taylor. The soundtrack is available on CD.<br /><br />The Director, "Lasseter tells Michele Norris how the idea for the film grew out of a two-month summer trip he took with his family after working nonstop during the 1990s. During that time, he directed the box-office hits A Bug's Life and both Toy Story movies, and served as executive producer for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo.<br />"I learned that the journey in life is a reward," he says. "It's about living every day to its fullest, and I knew that's what I wanted the film to be about." Lasseter talks about Cars, the challenges of directing an animated film, and how technological advances have -- and haven't -- affected his work. NPR, Morning Edition<br /><br />'Cars' is one of those movies that you tell friends about, urge them to see, by the DVD for family, and even promote this movie to your children.<br />So highly recommended. prisrob 01/01/06</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fast Backwards"></head><body><p>An interesting movie with a captivating (although not all that original) premise, &quot;Memento&quot; is a true cult film, one that tries to offer something slightly different and personal. The concept is good, but after the first half the movie gets a bit repetitive and unsurprising, culminating in a mildly disappointing ending. Still, the acting is top notch, since Guy Pearce truly is an excellent choice for the lead role, delivering a subdued and intriguing performance. Directing Christopher Nolan suceeds at creating a gripping and moody atmosphere with enough suspense and interest, grabbing the viewer`s attention. That`s particularly relevant, since in this story every detail counts. Well, the plot per se is hardly anything new, so what sets &quot;Memento&quot; apart from most thrillers is the way its story is told. As a whole, this effort is worthwile and appealing, yet it`s more cerebral, cold and distant than enjoyable, entertaining and warm. It`s also a bit too depressing, since the final revelation makes one look at the characters from a new (and darker) perspective. Still, &quot;Memento&quot; is a remarkable movie about human nature, lies, trust and love, providing a clever (perhaps too clever, by the way), unusual and witty mistery. It`s unfortunate that, at parts, it carries more style than substance, but it`s a solid cinematic experience nonetheless. <p>Worth a look. Or two, to confirm if it all makes sense after all (some details are contrived, yet overall it works).</p></body></html>

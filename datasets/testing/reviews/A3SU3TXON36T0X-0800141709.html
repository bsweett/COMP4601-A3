The film is regarded by many as one of the greatest classics of all time and satirizes the ludicrousness of such notions as Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.) and the horrors of nuclear war.  The film was made during the height of Cold War hysteria and shows the sheer lunacy and idiocy of the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union in their attempts to build ever greater weapons of mass destruction.  The film also shows the lunacy of scientists and generals who operate behind the scenes and plan to unleash these weapons upon an unwitting populace.  The film is meant to be a black comedy and thus features many absurd components which serve only to re-inforce in the mind of the viewer the horrible matters being presented in such a light-hearted manner.<br /><br />The movie begins with the lunacy of General Jack D. Ripper, who believes in a communist conspiracy to destroy the "bodily fluids" of the American people through fluoridated water.  Ripper decides to strike the Soviet Union with a nuclear attack and manages to do so without the authorization of the president by making use of a special emergency plan known as "Plan R".  The film then focuses on the men flying the plane which is set on unleashing this weapon upon the Russians, showing the conflicts that develop between them.  The film also features Peter Sellers playing Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, who serves as an important executive under General Ripper and tries to dissuade him from the attack.  The film then focuses on a special meeting of the president and his generals in the "War Room".  (One particularly humorous and memorable line from the movie occurs when the president makes the comment to one of his generals and the Russian ambassador that there is to be "no fighting in the War Room".)  The president notifies the Russians of the attack in an effort to thwart the attack and thus prevent a full scale and destructive nuclear war through the Russian ambassador.  Unfortunately, as it turns out, the Soviets have devised a "doomsday device" which upon the destruction of their own missiles will completely obliterate all life on earth.  Thus, the president must attempt to call back the U.S. aircraft which plan on unleashing this destruction before it is too late.  The film also features Peter Sellers as the Nazi mad scientist Dr. Strangelove who periodically alternates between giving the Nazi salute and addressing the president as "Mein Furher" and "Mein President".  Dr. Strangelove explains to the president how the doomsday device is to work and also offers up the possibility of an escape by a few selected people who will live under the earth in mines.  It should be pointed out that Dr. Strangelove is believed to be an amalgamation of the ex-Nazi scientist Werner von Braun and Edward Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb.  The film ends in a very disturbing manner as this terror is unleashed upon the world.<br /><br />This film remains an essential classic and is ranked by many as among the greatest of all times.  The message of the film is quite disturbing in that it shows how mass lunacy may break out and a nuclear war result.  Through the actions of madmen within the United States military and government, a nuclear war is made inevitable.  For those who lived under constant threat of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, such a possibility was a distinct reality.  Thus, while the film attempts to make light of this issue, underlying this humor is an all-too-disturbing reality.  This film is to be highly recommended to all thoughtful people who struggle with the notion that individuals in power continue to wield weapons of mass destruction and that they may be unleashed upon nations at any time.  While the Cold War is supposedly over, such weapons still exist and their reality remains all-too-apparent.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

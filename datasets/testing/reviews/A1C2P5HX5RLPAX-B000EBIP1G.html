I read the books and watched study versions of the educational films as a child. It's been years but the stories have always held a special place in my heart. The children were wonderful actors; the sets were beautiful; the special effects were excellent. Everything fit together perfectly. I was completely inthralled. I'll be rushing to buy this on dvd when it is released so I can watch it again and again. It's inspired me to dig out my book so I can read the complete works.</p></body></html>

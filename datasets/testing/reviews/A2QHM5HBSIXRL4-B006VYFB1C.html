<meta name="summary" content="Pitt, Miller, Zaillian, Sorkin and Hill nail the juxtaposition of Lewis' seminal book"></head><body><p>I've never been a big fan of Brad Pitt, but even I have to admit that he knocked it out of the park here on two levels: as the producer and driving force behind the film (even as it lingered in turnaround h-ll for years) and in his spot-on portrayal of Billy Beane.  I am, however, a long-time fan of Michael Lewis dating back to his debut with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039333869X">Liar's Poker</a>.  [Heck, I even read 'Losers' in its little-remembered original incarnation as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517286955">Trail Fever</a>.]  It says a lot that Lewis - skeptical as to how 'Moneyball' could ever be made into a film - has come out as a huge fan of the end product (I suspect - even though he took the money - that the same cannot be said of his view of the celluloid version of "The Blind Side").<br /><br />Lewis' hard-won approval says a lot about the combined talents of director Bennett Miller, screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, producer/star Pitt and an inspired cast, most notably Jonah Hill (an unlikely but relevatory pick as composite character, Peter Brand) and Phil Hoffman (who nails the dyspeptic Art Howe and his Venus and Mars relationship with Beane).  They distilled the essence of the story, delicately nailing the balance that Lewis achieves in the book: the juxtaposition of the deep-dive into the statistical arcania of Sabermetrics hard alongside rich character studies of the fascinating, complex Beane (Lewis knew he hit a goldmine there) and intriguing cases like Scott Hatteberg, a player whose career both defined and vindicated this new approach to baseball.  That juxtaposition is the Lewis oeuvre in a nutshell: it's the same feat he pulled off in "The Blind Side" (unlike "Moneyball," that film's makers gave only the briefest glimpse to the economics behind the fascination with Michael Oher's playing potential)<br /><br />About the only headscratcher here: why Paul Depodesta (Bean's real-life Peter Brand) would pull his participation from the film.  The guy's out giving speeches trading on that relationship (he even uses Lewis' agency), so why he passed on getting himself represented directly in the film doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.</p></body></html>

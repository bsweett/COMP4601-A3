<meta name="summary" content="Great sci-fi classic of alltime, as well as Drew Barrymore's adorable debut"></head><body><p>I was nine years old when I first this movie and it was great seeing again after 25 years.<br />The classic mega sci-fi hit about the lonely 10 year old boy who finds and befriends a gentle alien, is as wonderful as the classic ever was.<br />Elliot (Henry Thomas) stumbles across the alien who soon names himself ET, and soon his oldere brother Michael (Robert Macnaughton)  and his absolutely adorable 7 year old mischeivous sister Gertie (played by a vey young Drew Barrymore in her heartstealing debut performance).<br /><br />Some very memorable  secenes include the part where Gertie teaches ET to talk, where the kid's mother (Dee Wallace)  opens Elliot's cupboard and passes ET off as one of his toys, the tearjerking scenes of ET dying in the scientists medical facility, and of course the psychical connection of ET and Elliot, leading Elliot to experience the symptoms of being drunk in science class when ET is drinking the beer at home. Elliot sets all the frogs who are about to be dissected, free, and As the alien watches John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man, Elliott's psychic link causes him to kiss a pretty girl in the class he likes (Erika Eleniak) in the same manner.<br />humour includes the boys at school taunting Elliot that the alien he claims he has discovered is from 'uranus'.<br /><br />ET's later illness is paralelled by Elliot's illness and who can forget where Elliot, Michael and their friends on are lifted  their bycicles into the sky, while getting ET past the auhtorities.<br /><br />And then of course the scene where ET before being collected by his fellow aliens in the spaceship, says goodbye to Michael. Gertie and Elliot, and ET points to elliot's heart6 reminding him he will always be there.<br />Some really nifty reminders of the earely 80s teenage culture of the time including if you are really observant, Michael's space invaders sweatshirt.<br />This classic is as wonderful to see as ever for kids sseing it for the first time a smuch as  for adults taking a trip down memory lane.<br />It stands on it's own and was never spoiled by an attempt at a sequel (very wise of you Mr Spielberg!).</p></body></html>

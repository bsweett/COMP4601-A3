What would you do to Support them? What would you do to Provide for them? How can you Protect them...from the Evils of the world? Decisions, Decisions.... See how one man's Decisions lead to the creation of a &quot;Family&quot; of organized men who are at-odds with Society, The Police, The FBI...and each-other. A World within our world, yet completely outside of it--a world you cannot enter, unless you can drop the right name. I remember snippets of this film, from TV airings, as a teenager. Those images, saved in a backlog file in my brain, never really inspired me to rent this film. However, recent conversations led to me purchasing this movie and viewing it with Rapt Attention! I had no idea! The TV commercials for the movie did not do it justice. I thought it would be a long, slow, boring flick that you just sit-through to say you have seen it. WRONG ! This movie is Action-packed, from beginning to end! I had to rewind scenes and watch them Twice! Could Anyone have played The Godfather, other-than Brando (and, later, DeNiro)? I cannot imagine anyone-else playing this role.... Another review said that these people were born to play these parts. I agree. You will get lines stuck in your head, that you cannot unthink: &quot;Leave the Gun....Take the Cannoli.&quot; You will also understand movies like &quot;Robinhood, Men in Tights.&quot; I've watched that movie twice, never understanding the Dom DeLouise scene, until I watched The Godfather. This movie is not-only a Classic, it is an EXCITING Classic. Please, do not make my mistake, though! Get them ALL, before you start watching them! If you only get Godfather I, you will feel strangely compelled to run for the local video store, when the movie ends. Pile them all up and make a weekend of it. Godfather II is a little slow and dark, but is WELL-WORTH watching and Important for understanding III, which is Astounding. This series is definitely on my &quot;Top Ten&quot; List!</p></body></html>

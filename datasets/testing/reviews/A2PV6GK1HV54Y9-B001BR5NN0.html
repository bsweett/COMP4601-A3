Talented and an energetic cast which includes: Emilo Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, and Judd Nelson. This is a film I can watch over and over again, it's that good! If you want a great comedy/drama then The Breakfast Club is for you. Ally Sheedy steals every scene with her strange and lovable behavior. I highly recommend checking this winner out!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Halloween&quot; Redux"></head><body><p>If you ask John Carpenter how he got thru those long nights of writing out the screenplay for the sequel to &quot;Halloween&quot; his answer would consist of seven words - &quot;A 12 pack of Budweiser. Every night.&quot; He is also quoted, asking, &quot;How can you make a sequel to a movie that doesn't need one?&quot; In the wake of the monster success of &quot;Halloween&quot;, the film generated a lot of knockoff films. Some good, (&quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;When A Starnger Calls&quot;, &quot;Phantasm&quot;) and some real bad (&quot;Prom Night&quot;, &quot;Terror Train&quot; and pretty much the rest of the genre). So, it was inevitable that &quot;Halloween II&quot; would be unleashed. &quot;Universal Pictures&quot; threw it's hat in the slasher ring after it saw the unexpected success of &quot;Paramount Pictures&quot;' film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and bought the rights to two &quot;Halloween&quot; films (&quot;II&quot; and the awful &quot;Halloween III&quot;). &quot;Halloween II&quot; is a decent entry that has suspense, but, doesn't have the psychological hold the original has (for me this film is third best in the franchise right behind &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Halloween: H20&quot;).<p>Picking up seconds after the original, Dr. Loomis finds Sherriff Brackett and continues the hunt for &quot;The Shape&quot; known as Michael Myers. As for Laurie Strode, she's been taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, to tend to the severe wounds that were inflicted upon her in &quot;Halloween&quot;. Unbeknownst to all, &quot;The Shape&quot; knows where Laurie is and its only a matter of time before he gets to her.<p>This isn't a bad sequel, but, it does have some faults. The gore factor is turned up a bit (slashed throats are exposed, a burn victims face is shown up close, etc.). The scares are the jump out of the seat kind, rather than the psychological type that was evident thru &quot;Halloween&quot;. That film had exposed everybody's primal fear of having the feeling of being watched and turning around and no one is there (not so with &quot;II&quot;). By the time &quot;Halloween II&quot; was released, audience's tastes had changed for more gore, and out of the seat thrills (thanks to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;). Its like you could compare the first two &quot;Halloween&quot; films with two types of &quot;Coors&quot; beer, in the respect that &quot;Halloween&quot; is &quot;Coors&quot; and &quot;Halloween II&quot; is &quot;Coors Lite&quot;. Spooky stuff - less scary. Keep an eye out for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumni Dana Carvey (the church lady!) as a T.V. cameraman (you will have to pause your DVD player to see him).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nick Won't Be Making Deals With Murderers Ever Again"></head><body><p>Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) watches helplessly as his family is slaughtered by two thugs who break into his home.  Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is the prosecutor who, in order to maintain his high prosecution rate of 96%, strikes a plea bargain that shocks and angers Clyde.  The thug who orchestrated the home invasion, Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte), only receives a few years in prison while his partner, Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart), is given the death penalty.<br /><br />  Ten years later, Ames is being prepped for lethal injection, which is suppose to be painless.  However, chemicals are switched and his death is horrifyingly gruesome.  Darby is abducted and slowly tortured to death by having his limbs amputated without anesthesia.  Shelton is arrested for the murders and imprisoned.  Somehow he is able to continue killing everyone associated with the case.  Once a law abiding citizen, Shelton is determined to teach Nick that you should never make deals with murderers.<br /><br />  Expertly directed by F. Gary Gray and beautifully filmed in Philadelphia, "Law Abiding Citizen" is the best vigilante justice film I've seen since Charles Bronson starred in "Death Wish."  Gerard Butler and Jamie Fox head a stellar cast that had a great time working together on this film as evidenced by the commentary provided by producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel.<br /><br />  Gerard Butler, superstar of such megahits as "300" and "P.S. I Love You," gives a very convincing performance as a loving family man whose obsession for vengeance drives him to insanity.  Initially, I, along with many others, sympathized with Clyde's plight; I even cheered him on as he killed Ames and Darby.  However, the killing soon got out of hand and Clyde was quickly transformed from hero to villain.<br /><br />  Jamie Foxx ("In Living Color" television series) and Regina Hall ("Scary Movie" franchise) greatly surprised me.  I must admit to having never seen either one of them in a thriller.  Like Gerard Butler, both of them are well rounded performers.  Foxx's character, Nick, began as a type of self centered, materialistic villain who cared more about his success rate than the personal feelings of his clients.  To him, they were only statistics.  However, Nick undergoes a transformation while struggling to prevent Clyde from claiming more victims.  He lives to regret having made deals with the men responsible for slaughtering Clyde's wife and daughter.<br /><br />  Anchor Bay Entertainment has released a wonderful DVD presentation for "Law Abiding Citizen."  It has an anamorphic widescreen presentation of 2:40:1 that looks superb on a high definition television.  Subtitles have been provided for those of us who are deaf and hearing impaired.  There are some interesting special features that are essential viewing.  The most frightening one to me is "The Justice of Law Abiding Citizen."  It actually provides the loop holes (Felony Murder Rule, Exclusionary Rule and the Plea Deal) that made it possible for Darby to testify against Ames who received the death penalty even though it was Darby who committed the actual murders.  Forensic evidence and eyewitness testimony are also discussed in regards to how they can be perverted in order to free a suspect.<br /><br />  Trailers were provided for several movies:  "The Crazies" - a remake of George Romero's classic horror film; "The Men Who Stare at Goats" - a comedy of psychic experimentation starring George Clooney, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges; Michael Moore's documentary "Capitalism: A Love Story;" and the bloody and erotic "Spartacus: Blood and Sand."<br /><br />  If you enjoy watching vigilante justice films, then I highly recommend watching "Law Abiding Citizen."  It is a gritty, violent, emotional thriller that is quite provocative.  It asks the question:  "How far will you go to avenge the murder of a loved one?"  It makes the viewer wonder how unjust our justice system really is.  One thing is certain, Nick will never again make deals with murderers.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Long Ago and Far Away, Will It Happen Again?"></head><body><p>This was not a boxoffice smash as people just don't wish to be reminded of such calamity as happened at the 20th Olymiad in Germany in 1972.  Howard Cosell was there for ABC Sports and wrote a book about his involvement and the truth of the matter.  It all seemed like a bad dream.  There was terrible despair as it was kept out of the press as much as possible.  It was an echo of things past which sometime could be a precursor of things to come.<br /><br />Sometimes instinct compels you to say certain things to a certain limit.  Is it Joe Allen or Carl Hampton to blame for those awful, awful selections.  Who has the temerity to take responsibility for such a continuing campaign.  I simply can't give either the benefit of a doubt as both are cruel and mean grudge holders.  They continue to harass because of the power or ability, but it will backfire on both, whoever the culprit is.  The epitome of the flaws in today's society and radio in general.  It is a petty feud with jabs by Hampton against Allen.  It's a big sport to them.  It's sad they or the engineer (whoever hs may be) continue this charade of aggravation.<br /><br />Television is here to stay; it is the single most important medium of communication in the contemporary civilization.  Movies today exaggerate a situation or disaster, so that it is hard to know the truth or actual facts.  Cosell wasn't afraid to tell it like it is.  The movie, however, has much to be desired.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Creepy but Predictable"></head><body><p>Let it be known that Secret Window is as predictable as thrillers get and would usually be a movie I despise. Then why didn't I? For one, Secret Window is very well-made; creepy and effective and wonderfully shot. Johnny Depp is superb as always, and is joined by a great cast, which includes the beautiful Maria Bello, John Turturro, Charless Dutton, and Timothy Hutton.<br /><br />The suspense manages to build, slowly and steadily, to a very creepy, but predictable and unsatisfactory conclusion. Some may guess the twist long before the end credits, but even so, it's a chilling denouement and guaranteed to keep you in suspense until the somewhat ambiguous ending.<br /><br />All the performances are solid and the entire film makes an atmospheric use of handsome woodland and lakeside settings. Johnny Depp is an incredibly versatile actor and never disappoints with a performance. John Turturro does a memorable job as the man claiming to be the true author and Timothy Hutton is effective as the man who has stolen the affection of Depp's ex-wife. Mario Bello isn't given much to do but she is perfect as Depp's ex-wife and Charles Dutton never gives a bad performance. All of the proceedings are enhanced by Phil Glass' subtle background score.<br /><br />Overall, the film is well worth watching if you're a fan of Johnny Depp and enjoy a good mystery with a not so shocking twist.</p></body></html>

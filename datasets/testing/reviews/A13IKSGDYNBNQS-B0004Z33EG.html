<meta name="summary" content="One of Stallones best"></head><body><p>This is by far and away the best of the Rambo films, but funnily enough frequently forgotten, because the second movie was so much more successful. With elements of 'Deliverance' and 'Southern Comfort' this creates an atmospheric movie which is thrilling, entertaining and pretty violent as well.<br /><br />Stallone doesn't have to do much acting wise, but his action stuff is well done and generally he looks the part and is very believeable as a disgruntled Vietnam Vet. However its the always excellent Brian Dennehy as the local Town Sheriff, who has bitten off more than he can chew, that holds the film together, with another classy performance.<br /><br />IMO this is the only one of the first three Rambo films worth owning (I haven't seen the latest yet) and it should be in your collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Popcorn Movie"></head><body><p>I guess I don't understand the haters of this film. This was a fun pop-corn movie. You will always have the students of mythology hating anything that isn't verbatim to their gods and you will have those who hate anything re-made.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans is the story of Perseus, a son of Zeus, who must kill the kraken before it destroys some humans.<br /><br />Starring Sam Worthington as Perseus, Liam Neeson as Zeus (and really who else has the voice of a god?), and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, this film is as entertaining as any summer blockbuster.<br /><br />You have a group of men fighting giant scorpions, trying to take the head of Medusa, and riding a flying horse.<br /><br />The special effects are great. Go along for the ride and enjoy spectacle.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what they do for the sequel and I think I'd like to go back and watch the original because the effects they used for that movie was state-of-the-art at the time.<br /><br />Don't listen to the haters, this is a decent movie.</p></body></html>

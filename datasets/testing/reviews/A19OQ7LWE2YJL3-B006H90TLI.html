A few quirky features like a unique murder weapon, but another psycho killer ho-hum. I wasn't blown away. Josh Brolin was quite good as the protagonist, Tommy Lee Jones' role was rather small but well-played. The best part of the movie was the first 30 minutes. I was wishing he never went back obviously to the crime scene.<br />I thought 3:10 TO YUMA with Crowe & Bale was more riveting and had a better plot than this movie. But some people seem to go crazy over anything by Cormac MacCarthy.</p></body></html>

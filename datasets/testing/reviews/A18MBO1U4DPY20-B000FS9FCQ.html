<meta name="summary" content="EARNS RESPECT DESPITE CERTAIN GOOF-UPS"></head><body><p>The first half of this film has a great intelligent flow in terms of acting, dialogues, screenplay and background music. I loved V's introduction to the film and his dialogue delivery was very intriguing. Natalie Portman does a good job and she's proved her multidimensional side. This film has a few goofs but I'm not discussing them here, towards the second half it gets draggy and one feels the editing could have done more justice to the climax. The best scenes in the film are the ones where Natalie Portman gets a letter which she reads out and the writers' story of life is relived.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch in the theater.<br /><br />Overall - 8/10<br /><br />ps - I liked this film more than the newspapers said I would and more than most people did.</p></body></html>

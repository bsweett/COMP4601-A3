<meta name="summary" content="Fun and Outrageous"></head><body><p>"Kick Ass" is a spoof of superhero movies, but a very affectionate spoof.<br /><br />It's got a shocking amount of blood, shocking language, and at least one actor that verges on child-porn, at least in the eyes of some.<br /><br />But it's great.<br /><br />Very well written, has interesting characters (even the villains, who are cliches, are interesting), and a wildly skewed take on everything from teen nerdiness to who's really the baddest ass.<br /><br />And of course, best of all, the baddest of the very badasses is a skinny little 10-year-old girl with a purple wig.</p></body></html>

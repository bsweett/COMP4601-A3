<meta name="summary" content="Slam-bang entertainment"></head><body><p>One thing you can count on: When Angelina Jolie does an action movie, you know you're going to get action and plenty of it.  The action in "Salt" is so non-stop, so relentless, so slam-bang-in-your-face, that the film moves at warp speed and it's over almost before you realize it.  That the plot is patently ridiculous somehow doesn't seem to matter very much.  This movie is meant to be pure fun, and on that score, it delivers.<br /><br />Jolie plays Evelyn Salt (it's interesting that this role was originally written for a male actor, but Jolie proves she is more than able to handle it), a CIA operative married to a German scientist who specializes in all kinds of deadly spiders, who managed to get her out of a North Korean prison where she is being gruesomely tortured as the film opens.  But it turns out she may or may not be a Russian sleeper agent who is scheduled to go into action as soon as some very nasty stuff hits the fan; specifically, the assassinations of both the Russian and American presidents, and the detonation of a nuclear bomb or two.<br /><br />Salt's cover is blown (maybe) and she protests she was set up, but since nobody believes her, she's off and running in some really exciting chase sequences.  Jolie actually did some of her own stunts in this movie, although not the more dangerous ones such as jumping from the top of one speeding truck to another.  The real fun in this film comes from the fact that we can't really tell who Salt is.  Is she an American agent, or Russian, or Russian pretending to be American, or American pretending to be Russian?  By the end of the film we still don't know, but we know one thing: the way this film ends, a sequel is probably already on the storyboards.<br /><br />All of the actors give creditable performances, but Jolie's performance is what really makes you want to see this film more than once.  Tabloid gossip aside, she's a damn good actress, and she totally throws herself into this movie, literally and figuratively.  Tune in next summer (hopefully) for the next exciting episode.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/4/11:<br /><br />I just watched the DVD with all three versions of the film (theatrical release, director's cut and extended cut), and am wondering why in the world didn't the studio release the extended cut in the theaters?  It's a totally different ending, which I'm darned if I'm giving away, except to say that it's much more satisfying and makes for a vastly better movie overall.<br /><br />You can choose your version simply by going to the DVD menu, click on Play Movie, and then select whichever of the three you want.  The extended cut of this movie is the one to watch.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></body></html>

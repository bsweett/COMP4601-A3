Ray Liotta will probably never have a greater role than this since he has since fallen into doing B-movies or straight to video features. And Joe Pesci's Oscar performance as a psycho hood ranks up there with the best of Cagney. A little long perhaps but filled with juicy details of the mob and of course, DeNiros excellent performance. Also the HD DVD version of this classic adds a certain sheen to it all, though on Casino, it's even better</p></body></html>

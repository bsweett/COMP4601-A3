I'm Amazed!"></head><body><p>My Friend gets all these DVDs from Singapore, so I went over to his house to watch this movie and I loved it!<br /><br />The S/FX are amazing, especially the fact that this is in B/W with a splash of color! It has 3X story, and the blood looks so cool.<br /><br />But one thing- the UNREALISIM. It's a bit rediculous (I.E. The guy getting shot a zillion times and surviving and The guy surviving being hanged), but C'mon! It's just fiction!<br /><br />The story is about a B&W city called Sin City, and anything can happen! Jackie Boy is the best character, and he's so funny! I like his quotes (you're gonna love this baby).<br /><br />So see this today!<br /><br />UPDATE<br />3/7/05<br />So far only 2/9 ppl found my review helpful. WTF?? I wrote you a long and amusing review but u hate it. WHY?</p></body></html>

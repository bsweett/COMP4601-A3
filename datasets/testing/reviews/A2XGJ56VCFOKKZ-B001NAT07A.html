I'm glad I waited, though it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, and it could stand to be a lot better.<br /><br />First of all, choosing Halle Berry for the latest incarnation of Catwoman was the best decision the producers could make.  She makes a perfect Catwoman and does a great job.  Her costume is better than the one Michelle Pfeiffer used in "Batman Returns", though I still didn't like her mask.  Halle Berry is the best thing about this movie, especially with her whip appeal and sexy moves.  One scene I like in particular is the basketball game between Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) and Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), with the hip urban groove music matching the flow and rhythm of the game, which is more a physical flirtation between the two than an actual game.  This occurs when Patience is just learning about her new dexterous style.<br /><br />Now, for the bad...which is nearly everything else about the film.  The plot is flimsy and reminiscent of the first Tim Burton "Batman" film...cosmetics that does more harm and requires continuous use to prevent the scars on one's face.  Patience Phillips is a mousy commercial artist who is so timid and afraid of the boss (played by Lambert Wilson, best known as the Merovingian of the two "Matrix" sequels and essentially plays the same role in this film) that she takes his abuse and scorn.  Sharon Stone plays the wife of Monsieur Hedere, who's every bit as schemeing as her husband, though a bit more deadly.  This leads to the inevitable "cat fights" between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone.<br /><br />Someone complained about Patience Phillips being a mousy lady, but that's the point, at least with Selena Kyle (the original alter-ego of Catwoman).  The transformation of a mousy lady into a fierce, feline, femme fatale is the whole point about Catwoman and the empowerment of such a role.  That's why Patience is "mousy" at first.  What bothered me most about this film is Patience's sidekick, a white co-worker who practically pushes Patience on a date with Detective Tom Lone, and who wants the scoop on every little detail.  It was especially a cringe-worthy moment to hear this plumpy, dumpy white woman tell Patience, "give me my props!" and trying to act hip and cool.  It totally rang false.  The whole friendship between the two of them didn't see authentic, but was a mere contrivance to give Patience a friend that plays a semi-important role for the purposes of dialogue.  Now about that dialogue...very cliched and cheesy (such as Catwoman grabbing hold of a baddie's tongue and then saying, "cat got your tongue?").  The film is full of horrendous dialogue.<br /><br />Another complaint about the film is that too many scenes took place in industrial buildings.  It was just unoriginal and not very exciting.  It lends a sort of "been there, done that, seen that" blase to the whole film.  There's really nothing in here that screams to be seen, that just wows you the way the two "Spider-man" films do.  That movie has heart, this one doesn't.  My final critique is that the background music was often annoyingly distracting and didn't fit the scene (except for the basketball one-on-one game).  The people who made this film either tried to hard or didn't try hard enough...its not very original, exciting, or worth the money and time spent on it.  Halle Berry as Catwoman is the only good thing about this film and she makes it worth watching at least once.  Take her out of the equation and the film is third-rate, first draft stuff that should never have been given the greenlight.  Because this film bombed, there's little chance that a better made sequel will ever get made, which is a shame.  There's so many things one can do with a Catwoman film, but this film isn't it.</p></body></html>

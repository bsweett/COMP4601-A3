<meta name="summary" content="A Passionate Near Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is hugely ambitious.  He attempts to tell the story of the origin of the country in a violent, unceremonious bloodbath.  This is a wonderful film even for its flaws.  Just as my heading says, it is a near masterpiece.  The flaws are there, every reviewer will tell you this.<br /><br />One of the problems with the film is the character's motivations.  Amsterdam returning to avennge his father's death is perfect, but some of his actions seem faulty.  He appears to be fickle for no reason at times in the film.  Johnny (played by Henry Thomas) is the same way.  He betrays his "friend" for no other reason than to drive the plot forward.  I could go on in detail about the miscuses of other characters, touching on Diaz's lack of pickpocketing after it served its purpose for the storyline but I'll move on to what I liked about this movie.<br /><br />For one, it's absolutely beautiful, the sets, the lighting, the shots, everything.  The recreation of Old New York is magnificent.  I can't imagine why (COUGH*Harbey Weinstein*COUGH) the Academy did not award Dante Ferretti and Martin Scorsese for this wonderfully designed film.  The cinematography is just as excellent, with the scenes popping, figurately and at times literally, off the screen.  The colors are vibrant and exuberant, the buildings the pefect shade.  It looks remarkable.<br /><br />Another strong point is its absorbing power.  Once the story gets going, you just watch, amazed at what a great job Scorsese did.  It's not without its pacing problems, but it does a great job of keeping you entertained.  The last thirty minutes is when everything falls apart though.  The grand draft riots has no buildup.  It occurs, which, if it had happened at any other point in the film it would have been all right, at the end, when you need a dynamic ending to push the film into the epic stratisphere.<br /><br />A near masterpiece that, in the future, will be remembered as one of Scorsese's greatest accomplishments, probably right below <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RP2">Mean Streets (Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC18">Taxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062IVKS">Raging Bull (Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RKW">GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and in the same company with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCNV">The King of Comedy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1559409037">The Last Temptation of Christ - Criterion Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX8S">The Age of Innocence</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VZ9DK">Casino (Widescreen 10th Anniversary Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Now, for the DVD specs.  It features a great and informative comentary from Scorsese.  It must be heartbreaking talking over a truncated version of one of your most personal projects.  Two desing featurettes: Costume and Production.  A Discovery Channel documentary on the History of the Five Points, some other Five Points information and U2 "The Hands that Built America" (Golden Globe "Best Original Song" winner) video.<br /><br />Like stated, it's a near perfect film from one of America's greatest working and overall directors.  It's not a must see, but it's real close.  The violence may be a little unnerving but it's definitely needed to tell a story like this.  I hate the fact that the film's split over two discs but this still earns a high recommendation from me.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

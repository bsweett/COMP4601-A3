<meta name="summary" content="Dreamgirls rock the stage!"></head><body><p>The DREAMGIRLS rock the stage especially Jennifer Hudson,who rose to fame on AMERICAN IDOL and rose even higher in this film. Great moral support from Hollywood veterans Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover. This film was based on the Broadway play which debuted back in 1981. My earliest memory of DREAMGIRLS was the play,when I was a high school freshman back in 1985-86,I remember three black female students from my chorus class,rehearsed several numbers and performed them in either our Christmas concert or Spring concert. If you love soul music,you'll love this film.</p></body></html>

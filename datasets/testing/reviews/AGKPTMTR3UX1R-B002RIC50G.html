HANNIBAL RISING presents the infamous character brought so brilliantly to life by Anthony Hopkins in a surprisingly sympathetic light.<br /><br />Ten-year-old Hannibal and his younger sister Mischa, growing up in World War II-era Lithuania, are taken prisoner by a group of local Partisans who seem to have no loyalties whatsoever. During captivity, Hannibal is exposed to the most abhorrent of all atrocities. He spends the remainder of the film wreaking vengeance on the men who so profoundly scarred him.<br /><br />Lecter's behavior is violent and lurid throughout the film. Nonetheless, he is an avenging angel, albeit with a bizarre moral compass. This is more than can be said for the depraved people he targets.<br /><br />That being as it is, Lecter's intentions become not only understandable but laudable, even when his actions in themselves are repugnant. Questions of flaw, fault, and guilt tease the viewer throughout, forcing consideration of the conclusion that a dark justice is still justice.</p></body></html>

Based on the book by George Jonas, VENGENCE: THE TRUE STORY OF AN ISRAELI COUNTER-TERRORIST TEAM, it wrestles with the age-old question-- certainly one that U. S. leaders faced after 9/11-- of whether or not nations and individuals, for that matter, have the right to take an eye for an eye or take what they perceive as justice in their own hands without the benefit of a fact-finding tribunal. (The actor who plays Golda Meir says early in the film that "every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.") And what happens if you get the wrong eye, or if the eye is not guilty of this crime but of another just as heinous. And doesn't revenge breed more revenge and where does it all end? These are obviously hard questions. The film looks at both perspectives.<br /><br />Six members of the Israeli secret police set out to hunt down eleven Palestinians who allegedly were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of Israeli athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. (I still remember the sheer horror of watching the events on television and the sad but beautiful funeral music-- I believe it was something by Beethoven -- when the outrageous events occurred.) All the actors give superb performances. Eric Bana as Avner, the leader of the Israeli group is outstanding. He grapples with the morality question as what he is doing as a killer is contrasted with tender scenes with him and his wife and new baby whom he moves to Brooklyn. Daniel Craig and the other actors as just as good so Bana is just first among equals. The plot moves quickly and is convoluted although not impossible to follow. The sheer number of actors is rather staggering.  Tony Kushner of ANGELS IN AMERICA fame was involved in writing the screenplay. This has to be as good as anything Spielberg has ever done.</p></body></html>

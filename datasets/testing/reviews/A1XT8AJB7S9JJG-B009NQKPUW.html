<meta name="summary" content="For a guy who wasn't a huge fan of the "Alien" movies this was excellent. I really enjoyed it and recommend this. I say A."></head><body><p>"You don't understand, this place isn't what we thought it was. I was<br />wrong. We were so wrong. We must leave!" When scientists Elizabeth<br />(Rapace) and Charlie (Marshall-Green) discover a pictogram that matches<br />many others found around the world they think they finally have enough<br />evidence of life from other worlds. They along with many others board a<br />ship called "Prometheus" to venture many light years away from Earth to<br />test their theory. What they find is beyond what they were ready for,<br />and more then they can handle. I have never really been a big fan of<br />the "Alien" movies but this one looked really good to me. I have to say<br />this was much better then I was expecting. The beginning was<br />interesting and once it got going it was a very tense and a sometimes<br />scary experience. I have to admit that I was totally sucked in to the<br />movie and it made me want to re-watch the other "Alien" movies to see<br />if this one gave me new found excitement for them. I recommend this to<br />all sci-fi fans and for those that loved the original movies this is a<br />must see. Overall, an extremely entertaining adventure that is well<br />worth your time. The last scene gave me a chill. I loved it. The only<br />complaint I have is that Charlize Theron's character seemed a little<br />unnecessary. This like so many other prequels though fall in to the strange aspect of the technology of movies makes it seem like they had cooler stuff in the beginning of the sagas then in the originals which is set in the future. I give it an A.</p></body></html>

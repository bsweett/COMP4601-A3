<meta name="summary" content="INTENSE FILM, WITH FABULOUS CAMEOS FROM KINGSLEY + CONNELLY!"></head><body><p>Like Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley is a master of the unspoken. The subtleties of his facial expressions presented in moments of either joy or frustration are so masterfully restrained, it's a pleasure simply to watch him! <p>In "House of..," he plays an ex Iranian militiary man now working menial jobs in the US. It's probably a predicament that we rarely think about -- perhaps we'd prefer not -- and it's certainly a subject that Hollywood would rather brush by. But Perelman's film, based on Andre Dubus III's 1999 best seller, not only corrects this social/artistic delinquency but does it in such a bold and imaginative way and with such driving force that "House of Sand and Fog" works as much as a potent entertainment as it does as a morality play.<p>I haven't seen much of Jennifer Connelly before, but her absolutely knock-out presence on the screen as a murky character with an alcoholic past is dazzling. When the characters of Kingsley and Connelly finally clash halfway through the film, the film, having until then been a paean to silence and unspoken loyalties, becomes a terrifying thriller, riveting everyone with whom I saw the picture. Perelman moves from a mood piece to a suspenseful drama effortlessly. A jaw-dropping conclusion completes a powerful, unbelievably sad piece of work.<p>It's a harrowing story, cathartic and elegant, beautifully filmed, stirringly told. It will toy with your emotions and work them into a frenzy. What a splendid accomplishment for a first-time director. <p>Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

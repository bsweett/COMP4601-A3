X-Files alumni James Wong and Glen Morgan return to the series they helped spawn with Final Destination 3; which is sadly the worst installment of the series yet.  Rising star Mary Elizabeth Winstead (soon to be seen in Grind House and Live Free or Die Hard) has a premonition of impending doom on a rollercoaster ride, and wouldn't you know it as soon as she and a few friends exit that everybody dies painful and horrible deaths?  Anyone familiar with the first two films knows what's going to happen, the sad part is that this time around isn't as fun as the other two.  The first film was a surprisingly good thriller, while the lesser second installment was trashy fun.  Final Destination 3 just doesn't have that spark that made the other films guilty pleasures.  Not to mention that most of the actors are terrible to boot, but Winstead is plenty easy on the eyes.  There's some nice CGI generated gore effects, and some inventive deaths (you'll want to avoid tanning beds for a while); although many of which can't hold a candle to anything found in the first two films.  Final Destination 3 isn't absolutely horrible, but it's not the enjoyable, sleezy trash fest that one would come to expect from the series either.  New Line, who made a name for themselves with films like these, have given an overly generous heaping of extras to the DVD; some of which are worth checking out more than the film itself.</p></body></html>

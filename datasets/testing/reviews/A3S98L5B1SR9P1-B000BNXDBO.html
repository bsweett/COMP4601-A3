Although it does follow the same plot line as one of the films by the same director ("Dude Where's My Car"), it is lovable and the characters don't learn too many lessons. THANK the writers...There is no big moral and they don't sicken you with too much character growth. Go see the movie. Don't expect it to change you life, just expect to be entertained.</p></body></html>

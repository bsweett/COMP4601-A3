<meta name="summary" content=""Not As Good As "Unforgiven""></head><body><p>"Unforgiven" was Eastwood's finest work. It had incredible dialogue that explains their legends. "Unforgiven" had demensions in their character and had an incredible story. There is really nothing original about "Mystic River", or even an original twist.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />Jimmy,Dave,Sean. Friends who grew up in a working - class Boston. They drift apart after a terrible tragedy. Years later, brutal events reconnect them.<br /><br />This is a great film, I wish I could of given it five stars, but it's not original, but this film has great acting.  Tim Robbin and Sean Penn deserved their Oscar's.</p></body></html>

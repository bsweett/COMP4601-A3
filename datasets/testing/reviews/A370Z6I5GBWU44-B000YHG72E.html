<meta name="summary" content="Silly"></head><body><p>But rather amusing. Will Ferrell is hysterical in this film as an elf who has just discovered that he really is human, after having been accidentally taken from his home by Santa's sack of toys)<br /><br />Will must find his real father and acclimate to human life. Since he has been raised as an elf, this leads to some quite hilarious situations. He eats an insane amount of sugar, adding it to just about anything and brags about needing so little sleep along with making toys while he's in his father's apartment. The ending is a bit cliche and corny, but overall this is actually a pretty enjoyable movie.</p></body></html>

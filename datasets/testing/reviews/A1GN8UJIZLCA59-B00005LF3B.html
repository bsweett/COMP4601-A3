The film tells the story of a Federal Express employee, Chuck,  who is stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific.  He is forced to use his wits to survive.  The survival scenes are sandwiched in between Chuck's life in Memphis pre and post island.  The pre-island scenes show Chuck as a time obsessed man, whose main goal is to make certain packages arrive on time.  He shows off his tyrannical devotion to time in the movie's opening scenes where he is training people at a new depot in Moscow.  Back home for Christmas, we meet his girlfriend, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt.  On Christmas day he is called off again and he promises Kelly he'll be home for New Year's Eve and at the airport they exchange gifts.  Kelly gives Chuck a pocket watch and amongst his gifts is an engagement ring.  On this flight, the plane encounters turbulence and goes down.  The crash is a fiery spectacle that shows off Mr. Zemeckis' skill as a director.  Chuck is the lone survivor and he washes up on the island.  Armed with only a few items (ice skates, videotapes) from Fed Ex packages, he forced to adapt to live on the album.  His lone companion is a volleyball he names Wilson (the ball's maker).  Wilson is really an extension of Chuck himself as his &quot;face&quot; was created a bloody palm print of Chuck's own hand.  It is on the island where we see the acting skills that make Mr. Hanks the best in the business.  Through his struggles to make fire, eat, drink and eventually build a boat to leave the island.  He literally all by himself, with only Wilson to interact with.  Mr. Hanks' draws our sympathy and we share in his frustrations.  We feel his desperation and the scene where he kicks Wilson out of a cave and then desperately searches for him in the dark is utterly heartbreaking.  After four years Chuck leaves the island and is rescued at sea.  Upon his return to Memphis, he finds that he was of course left for dead and even buried.  Kelly has married and has a child.  In a tearful reunion, Kelly declares she still loves him, but they both know their relationship can't work.  Cast Away suffers in the scenes off the island as they filled with movie cliches and are stiff.  The scenes on the island are worth watching to see this generation's greatest actor shine.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One star for Connelly and Smith"></head><body><p>Jennifer Connelly and young Jaden Smith are the only reasons to watch this dreck. The rest of it is silly, dull, preachy, with cheesy effects and the most wooden performance yet (and that's saying something) by Keanu Reeves.<br />mild spoiler.....<br /><br />Apparently, we humans have trashed our planet so badly that other beings must intervene so save the other species by getting rid of us.  But then Keanu/Klaatu notices that a stepmom and son can have a tender moment, so he changes his mind and we are spared after all.<br />Have you had enough yet?<br />There's really nothing else to say.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two Stars Show How it is Done"></head><body><p>Just a note to indicate that the years intervening since this film appeared have done nothing to dull the luster of this thriller nor of the two stars who, singly and together, pretty much hold the stage throughout the performance. Credit should be given to everyone concerned with the film but it is the actors we get to see. The transition from joy- to terror- filled days is done well while the twists and turns make dramatic logical sense. Recommended for anyone who takes pleasure in the suspenseful.</p></body></html>

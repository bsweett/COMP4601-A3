<meta name="summary" content="Great acting; poor script and direction"></head><body><p>"Lucky Number Slevin" is chock full of fantastic performances from great actors like Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley.  Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and the rest of the cast also do fantastic work.  But the direction is poor.  We see the strings in a lot of the scenes; dialogue being fired back and forth in an artificial and stilted manner - the fact that's across the board means it's a directorial and not an acting problem.<br /><br />And the script.  Wow.  It's a second draft Tarantino clone that needed a couple more drafts to be worth shooting.  It's chock full of unbelievable coincidence, unnecessary complication, and uneven pacing.<br /><br />This may be worth a rent.  But "Lucky Number Slevin" should not be purchased until you've spent a couple dollars on a rental.</p></body></html>

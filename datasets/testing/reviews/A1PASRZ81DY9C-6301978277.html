Maybe it's the writing...maybe it's the direction...maybe it's the performances...maybe it's everything. This one was pretty much performance driven. However, I found the storyline to be weak and uneven at times. Whenever the mob guys showed up, Some Like It Hot wasn't what I hoped for overall. When the attention was shifted back to the trio, it's a very, very funny picture. Of the three, Jack Lemmon gave the best performance. Tony Curtis was always a talented actor and earned his due respect with his work. Marilyn Monroe was fair but largely buoyed by the two male leads. In fact, I can't really think of a film that she was a standout, alone from the rest of the cast. Let's not forget one more great performance: Joe Brown as Osgood Fielding III. All in all, Some Like It Hot is a funny picture, but I feel the mob angle took too much away from the central focal point of the comedy as the audience can see the rest of the band outright disappeared after the train. AFI had voted the film as the greatest comedy of all time. Please...</p></body></html>

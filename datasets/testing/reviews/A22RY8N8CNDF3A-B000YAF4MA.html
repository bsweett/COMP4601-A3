<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but Not Realistic"></head><body><p>The movie is entertaining, funny and poignant at the end.  We all have a list of things we want to do or accomplish in life, but haven't.  The "Bucket List" gives us a chance to see and live our dreams through the two elderly men,  Carter Chamberlain (Morgan Freeman) a happily married auto mechanic, and Edward Cole (a billionaire playboy).  Both happen to share a hospital room and both have terminal cancer with just months to live.<br /><br />When Edward Cole (who has billions and wants to spend it) was trying to convince Carter Chamberlain to take the time they had in remission to do things on the bucket list, he compared how fast the last 45 years of his life had went and how fast the coming months would go by.  Edward asked Carter if he rather go home to his family and have them adjust their lives and routines around his disease or celebrate what time was left?<br /><br />If you can take the leap of faith that terminal patients can run off for months without a care and enjoy every minute they have left - you get the message of the film and enjoy the life, love, laughter.</p></body></html>

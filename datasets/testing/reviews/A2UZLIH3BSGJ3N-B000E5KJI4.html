<meta name="summary" content="Better than Alexander"></head><body><p>This film wasn't as great as it was advertise,but it was WAY better than Oliver Stone's Alexander.Mostly because they were trying to pull off that "epic" film feel and they did.The action/fight scenes were done very well.Just enough blood to satisfy the "gore" fanatics out there.The story moved steadily and didn't  tred in one place too long.I have to hand it to Bradd Pitt,he muscled up for the part although it seemed as though there was some overacting done by him and some of the other actors.They sure did grease up Brad though,it looked like he was bathed in olive oil for every scene.Yuck!Good with food,bad on Brad.<br /><br /> Orlando Bloom was a sissy.I think they could have prortrayed him less as a wimp in love with Helen of Troy and more like a guy that could stand on his own.Maybe they were trying to be historically acurate to the Greek fable,but I found it annoying to hear him wimper and go on about how his love for Helen was so deep,he would sacrifice himself for her then get his ass kicked in by an old fart he should have cut to ribbons.I thought his older brother should have gutted him and thrown him over the boat in the begining of the film.<br /><br /> Lastly,was Eric Banna.He was (next to Brad) the highlight of this film.He really carried this film character wise.He is really turning out to be one hell of an actor,and well deserved.The next Russel Crowe?Maybe?If you want to see a bad ass film with Eric Banna,see "Chopper"(skip The Hulk).Some people liked Chopper,others did'nt but it was a fantastic film with brilliant acting done on his part.All in all,looks wise,story/plot....Troy was a good,watchable film.Perhaps a bit long,but hey...isn't that why they call them epics?Its well worth watching the one time,I'm not sure I'd want to own it.Boycott Alexander,it was a piece of S*&%#!@#%&!</p></body></html>

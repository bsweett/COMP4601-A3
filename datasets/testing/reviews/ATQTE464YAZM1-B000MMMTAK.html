<meta name="summary" content="I like-a this movies! Is very nice! High five!"></head><body><p>I saw this film a bit late. All my friends were about it, and it seemed like any where I went with them they were quoting it. This actually worried me somewhat - I've had experiences like this in the past and when I go see the movie I find it bad or simply overrated. Thankfully, when I saw this on DVD at last, it was not one of those films.<br /><br />"Borat" is a mockumentary centered around Borat, the Kazakh journalist from the Ali-G Show, who ventures to New York City to find out what Kazakhstan can learn from America. Catching a rerun of "Baywatch," Borat finds himself in love with Pamela Anderson and convinces his friend Azamat that they need to head to California for further research.<br /><br />The journey is essentially a series of Borat skits tied together by the Pamela Anderson storyline, in which Borat talks to real people pretending to be a serious journalist. Regardless of this thin plot it is still an enjoyable movie. Each scenario is just as funny as the last, and even though there was a lot of outcry over how this film portrayed Kazakhstan I think it makes fun of America just as much. While calling Sacha Cohen a genius might get me heckled, he is really clever in the way that he can call people out on the faults of their beliefs while playing dumb the whole time. For example, there's a scene where he's riding in an RV with some frat house guys who exclaim, "Remember, when you have sex with a girl, don't call her back!" Borat laughs and says, "Because you don't have her number, right?" The guys look at one another and stutter, and eventually mutter something along the lines of, "Well...you know, it's an honor thing, it's about respect." There's another scene where he's at a rodeo as a special guest and opens up with, "We support your war on terror!", gets applause, then starts saying more and more ridiculous stuff ("May George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq!") and STILL gets applause.<br /><br />Actually, truth be told, it may not be a movie for all tastes. There's a wrestling scene in the hotel room that will haunt your dreams and retard sleep for nights to come. This is another example of one of those films you either love or hate, and I happened to love it. So go ahead, check it out. Who knows, you may love it PAUSE not.</p></body></html>

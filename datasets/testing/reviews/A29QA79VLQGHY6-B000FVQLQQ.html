<meta name="summary" content="Interesting package; sound has problems"></head><body><p>The DVD of Ron's Howard's Oscar winner about troubled math genius John Nash tops the theatrical experience, despite some technical flaws. The video looks handsome in its scenes of Eastern academia, fall colors warm but a bit flat at times. The nightmarish cold war scenes impart a definite chill with midnight-rendezvous blacks and cobalt blues. True flesh tones help sell Greg Cannom's often terrific makeup work. <p>James Horner's swirling, math-inspired music sinks deep subwoofer roots via the Dolby Digital. The dialogue sounds muffled at times. Star Russell Crowe, in particular, seems to swallow more than a few lines, but it sounds like a mix or production issue. The problem can be mitigated by hiking your center speaker volume -- a fix that's a [bad] throwback to the early days of the DVD format. On Howard's commentary, the review disc's center track took a sudden leap in volume (at 1:49). Surround was OK but not much of a factor.<p> In his commentary, Howard does not address the various controversies surrounding "A Beautiful Mind" and its many fictions, but he shares some of the internal debates over the film's tricky "delusional" scenes. He points out clues planted along the way for those working on the movie's mysteries, "wondering if we were going to get caught." While Howard works hard at being a good host, his understated commentary does become hard to sit through as the movie passes two hours. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, whose adaptation won the Oscar, seems more at home with the commentary process. He does, however, repeat many of Howard's observations. The special features include some interesting shots of Crowe and Nash on the set, looking like bookends of a life. The section on makeup (the characters age a half century) is fascinating.</p></body></html>

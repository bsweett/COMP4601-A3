<meta name="summary" content="Wade In The Water"></head><body><p>A million different water references popped up when I first thought of writing this review.  From the standard "all wet" cliche to "drizzly drips," I thought of them all.  "Dark Water" is, like a thousand other mediocre flicks these last few years, based on a mediocre Japanese horror flick by overrated Japanese writers about a creepy ghostchild that uses the "boo!" factor to a tiring degree in an attempt to scare the audience.  I'll admit that "The Grudge" actually had a couple of these moments, so did "The Ring," but "Dark Water" has none of this.<br /><br />It drips along at a snails pace with only slight hints as to what is exactly going on.  We're thrown off the trail by Jennifer Connelly's character a couple of times when she seems to be losing her mind.  In this film, she's fighting through a really nasty custody case with her ex, and as part of her struggle, she moves into a bleak apartment complex occupied by a wasted Pete Postlethwaite and John C. Reilly.  Both of these actors are ten times better than this film allows them to be, though Reilly manages to toss a little humor into his character.  Dougray Scott is pretty good as the ex, and Tim Roth turns in the top performance as Connelly's caring and daring lawyer.<br /><br />As the story puddles from dull moment to dull moment, Connelly and her daughter begin to have "experiences."  The daughter has the most contact with "something" in the beginning of the flick, but as it continues, the story centers its focus on Connelly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film ends with a literal splash, but not a great splashdown.  Connelly and company were wasted in this boring and uneventful flick.  I'm sure that if you're a fan of the other snoozer "horror" from Japan as of late, you'll probably drink this wet dog right up.  With that in mind, be prepared for more of the same Japanese scares.  If that's your bag, pick this up.  If you prefer your horror with more of an actual story, "Dark Water" will leave you feeling all wet.</p></body></html>

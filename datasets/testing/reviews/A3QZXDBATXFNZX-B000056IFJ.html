I liked this movie and its one of my favorite's there is not much more I can say except that its a good movie and I loved it. This film just came out not to long ago on a great DVD totaly remasterd and lots of other goodies including delated scenes. This is a great sci-fi and a brillent movie thanks to James Cameron. You can also get the 2 disk DVD of T2 witch is another great DVD with a version never seen witch adds more than 20 min to the picture.</p></body></html>

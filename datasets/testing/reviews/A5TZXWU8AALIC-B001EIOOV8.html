GOODFELLAS was just one hood's story of the Mob from the 1950s to the 1980s--very smooth and steady.  But CASINO was not only spread out over three interesting characters, but it also tried to tell the story of Las Vegas itself.  At least Vegas of the 1970s.<br /><br />(To be honest, as much as I love Robert DeNiro, I thought his character would've been more interesting if he'd been played by a less powerful presence.  I don't have a problem with his performance--he was great--but I think someone a little less threatening would've made Pesci's monster scarier.)<br /><br />To pack it all in, CASINO had an almost-nonstop narration from a lot of the characters.  After my first viewing, I felt as overwhelmed and frazzled as a weekend in Vegas.<br /><br />I know these almost sound like complaints, but they're really just quibbles.  It's Scorcese, DeNiro, Pesci, another true story of crime and life and death in America.<br /><br />And Frank Vincent, after getting slammed in a car door by Pesci in RAGING BULL and getting stomped, knifed, and shot by Pesci and DeNiro in GOODFELLAS, finally gets some payback this time around.<br /><br />I'm glad I waited for this edition: I loved the outtakes with Scorcese's mom shooting her scenes of reacting to bad language (and scolding her own son when he repeats a line!), and, since this is a true story, you can watch the History Channel's show about the real story with the real people.<br /><br />The cameos are great: Don Rickles, Dick Smothers, L.Q. Jones, even Joe Bob Briggs.  The current mayor of Las Vegas appears as who he was back in that day: a lawyer who actually represented the guy Joe Pesci plays.<br /><br />CASINO is a sprawling but finely-crafted film about a Vegas that just doesn't exist anymore.</p></body></html>

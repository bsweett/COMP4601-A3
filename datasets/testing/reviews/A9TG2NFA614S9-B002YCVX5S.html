He directed and wrote the film. He's a very imaginative moviemaker who is a fanatical movie buff, very interested in the writing and the dialogue, and he has some American Indian ancestry which will explain a number of features of this film. Sit back and savor the story and the way it is told. It is at times leisurely paced because he wants moviegoers to relish the dialogue. It's a moviegoer's delight with a lot of inside movie stuff going on.<br /> It's a rousing action-adventure yarn, melodramatic, and in the best movie tradition. There's some hammy, over-the-top acting, a lot of violence, and a very cleverly devised screenplay. You'll see flashbacks that help to elucidate the story or characters, and the names of some characters will be telegraphed with written headlines. French and German dialogue is accompanied by subtitles; all of these are trappings which help to validate the narrative. The movie starts with a soundtrack from a Western that may get you in the mood for this serious fantasy.<br /> The scene is set mainly in occupied France in World War II, and you'll see Hitler, Goebells, and the rest of the top Nazi crew.<br /> Central to the the movie's storyline is Colonel Hans Landa, "the Jew Hunter" of the Nazi SS, played by Christopher Waltz who won an Oscar as best supporting actor. At the beginning of the story he is tracking down a Jewish woman, Shosanna, who is hiding out on a French dairy farm. She escapes and later takes over her aunt's art cinema in Paris. A German soldier, Fredrick Zoller, a hero sniper who has killed 350 of Germany's enemies, falls for her. Goebbels has made a propaganda film, "The Nation's Pride", retelling the soldier's exploits, and it's going to be shown in Shosanna's theater at the urging of Fredrick. All the German bigwigs will be at the premiere.<br /> Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine (remember gravelly-voiced Aldo Ray, a movie star a few generations back) who is leading a squad of eight Jewish-American soldiers. They have been parachuted behind enemy lines, and are terrorizing, mutilating and scalping German troops, Apache style.<br /> An Italian movie with the same title was made in 1978. Are we really to take seriously a film in which the German actress and double agent is named Bridget von Hammersmark?<br /> Pitt and his gang are planning to blow up the cinema, but Shosanna is planning her own vengeance. The long scene in the tavern with the British implant and Bridget is suspenseful because we get the feeling that the Brit's German is going to give him away to the SS officer. The scene in which Landa matches a shoe to Bridget's foot is reminiscent of "Cinderella", but so devastatingly different in outcome.<br /> Sit back and let this movie captivate you and don't worry about historical accuracy. It's old-fashioned moviemaking magic at its best.</p></body></html>

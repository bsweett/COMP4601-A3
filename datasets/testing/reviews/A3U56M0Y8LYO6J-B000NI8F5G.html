The songs from The Sound of Music are still being hummed to this day. Credit must also be given to the demented but widly entertaining South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. But the granddaddy of the genre has to be Singin' in the Rain. Seeing Gene Kelly dancing drenched down the street has become one of the most iconic of movie images. Never has there been a better leading man for the Hollywood musical. The movie chronicles the transition period when silent films evolved into talkies by showing all the amusing growing pains producers, directors, and actors experienced. You can't help but smile when you see microphones being hidden wherever there was room or shudder when you hear the shrill voice of a silent film star who's career will come to an abrupt end with the advent of the voice track. Mix brilliant supporting turns by Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds into the equation and the result is classic cinema. The Good Morning number and the Make 'em Laugh number still amaze but what can top the Singin' in the Rain number? It's timeless and a fitting legacy to the great Gene Kelly.</p></body></html>

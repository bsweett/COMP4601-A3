He's a middle-aged man in a track suit, he's had several women in his life. The day that one of them leaves him he gets a letter; he doesn't know which one of his ex-girlfriends it's from, but she says in the letter that she had his baby 20 years ago. With the help of his Ethiopian neighbour (cue opportunity to have Ethiopian jazz in the soundtrack) he works backwards and comes up with five names. So he goes to visit several of them to try and solve the "mystery." There's not much mystery, but there's an opportunity to film several episodes. The first one is the best - Sharon Stone, and her "daughter" Lolita, played by a magnetically horny Alexis Dziena. It goes downhill from there. A lot can happen to people in 20 years - some end up in loveless marriages with real estate developers, some become psychics, while others slum it as biker chicks. But life is long and good things can come of it if you're Bill Murray and you don't take things too seriously or get delusional about a son you may or may not have. There's always tomorrow. The film uses quite good songs in its soundtrack (including, briefly, Sleep), and the fantastic "There Is An End" by The Greenhornes with Holly Golightly. Great boogie woogie retro rock with cool old guitar plucking. Crazy, dad, crazy...</p></body></html>

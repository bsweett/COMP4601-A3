<meta name="summary" content="Watch This If Only For Leo's Pronunciations"></head><body><p>Shutter Island is not a film I expected to like. A psychological thriller with touches of horror and jump scares? Boring. And it would be too in the hands of literally anybody else. Instead, we have Scorsese making moods like it's nobody's business & creating atmosphere while still balancing those pesky things called plots and characters. Leo makes good use of the accent and brings some humanity to an otherwise messed up man.<br /><br />Granted, one could only come to this conclusion after the end of the movie since the movie lives or dies by its 3rd act. Personally, I think they did a great job with it. It's unrealistic as all get out, but Scorsese sells you on it, and rest assured if you go back through the movie, it still mostly holds up with the twist. But here's the thing, without the twist, it would be a fairly generic and boring film, even if everything else was the same. The ending and the reveals/twists bring a quiet intensity to the proceedings which lead to some good emotional and dramatic moments, and somehow makes the rest of the film worth it.<br /><br />Overall, if you like a good Scorsese mood piece, then by all means watch this movie. It's not a brilliant movie, and we could debate the warrant of that ending all day long, but in the end, Shutter Island is pretty entertaining.</p></body></html>

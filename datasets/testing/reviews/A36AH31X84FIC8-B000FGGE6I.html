<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Violet Film."></head><body><p>I Just Watched this film the other day and just loved it. Milla Jovovich yes she is easy on  the eyes she quite lovely, i have to say that i  heard awful reviews about this movie so i did'nt and  go see on the big screen  i wish i would've though this film is total eye candy it's just wonderfully photographed. for those of you expecting  this movie to make a whole alot of sense then i would suggest you throw  your logic brain out the door and enjoy the movie otherwise you'll make yourself crazy because there is little or no plot  just a simple outline of a story and alot of action shooting etc. the  story takes place in  the future as all sci-fi films do this film reminded me matrix and kill bill but not as bloody as bill. it's PG-13 for violence, some lauguage, mild brief nudity in a scene but  you don't see much it's a  backshot so nothing for parents to worry , but all the same parents can screen it before letting their kids see it . But i would recommended this not for young kids ,Only Teens to Adults .</p></body></html>

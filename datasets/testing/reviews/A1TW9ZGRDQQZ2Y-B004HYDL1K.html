They should have paired it up with Piranha 3-D and called it Grindhouse 2. Ever since the fake trailer in Grindhouse, fans have been calling for a feature length version, starring one of the toughest looking dudes to ever grace the screen.<br /><br />It's about time Danny Trejo, who I can't believe is 66 years old, finally gets the lead role. While he plays a great quiet menace (few faces can strike fear with just one look), he is supported with maybe the best cast ever to be assembled for a pure trash (in the best sense) film. Robert De Niro, Steven Segal and Don Johnson all play villain roles and they seem to having a blast. This is Steven Segal's best work (not saying much I know, but he fit's the part) and Robert De Niro, who seems to be channeling some of his Cape Fear accent, hasn't done anything this memorable in the last decade. Of the three main female roles, only Michelle Rodriguez leaves an impact. Jessica Alba is okay, but not all that believable, and Lindsay Lohan's character seemed like an afterthought. Cheech Marin provided a couple of good laughs, one having to do with...you guessed it, a certain green substance.<br /><br />I was worried the whole political message about illegal immigration would be too much, but it fit the mold of the story and didn't get too heavy. The script takes itself seriously for the most part, but there is a decent amount of humor. There was actually a bit more to the plot than I had expected going in, but don't worry, you'll still get plenty of lines made of only the sharpest cheese.<br /><br />The fight scenes and gore are fantastic. Machete likes to lop off heads and body parts using his namesake, but that doesn't stop him from trying out the occasional pistol, corkscrew, pimped out weed wacker with saws for blades, hospital knives turned into a swinging mace, a mini-gun strapped to the front of a motorcycle, and many, many more. Did I mention that he uses some poor guys' intestine, while he's still alive, in order to jump out a window and reach the floor below? So sick, yet so undeniably creative. The fights are edited in quick Robert Rodriguez fashion, but you never really lose sight of what's happening to who.<br /><br />On the downside, even though it didn't drag bad enough for me to check my watch, around 10-15 minutes could have been trimmed off to make it flow a little better. Oh, and what the heck happened to Tom Savini's character? He just vanished.<br /><br />The movie ends by claiming Machete will return in the sequel, Machete Kills, and the third entry in the trilogy, Machete Kills Again. I guess it's really more of a joke, unless it does well enough at the box office.<br /><br />This is the guy movie The Expendables wishes it was. I thought Stallone's effort was average, especially now, after seeing just one lone man with more raw toughness oozing out of his worn and scarred face than all those Expendable guys combined.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good movie but..."></head><body><p>Cinderella Man is a good historical movie, set in the great depression and based on James Braddock, a boxer who overcame all odds. He is played with great poise by Russell Crowe..and Rennee Zellwegger does a good job as his wife. Paul Giammatti is also good as his coach but sometimes is annoying.<br /><br />So the acting is good for one. The boxing is realistic and all but...I think I know why this wasn't a hit at the box office. For one because American audiences usually prefer garbage like Mr. and Mrs. Smith but also because of the timing. This movie came out a couple months (more than a couple probably) after Million Dollar Baby. And the reason I didn't want to see it for one was because I had already seen Million Dollar Baby and wasn't interested in seeing a clone set in the great depression.<br /><br />So yeah, it's a good movie with good acting but it's just not original. It's the male version of Million Dollar Baby and in all fairness, there wasn't a need for that version. Oh and yeah, Million Dollar Baby is a better movie.<br /><br />Sure it's a good movie, but it's not original. And originality is something that I find to be important in movies.</p></body></html>

("Who watches the watchmen?")"></head><body><p>Watchmen, the graphic novel by Alan Moore upon which Watchmen, the film, was based has a huge cult following. From the DC Comics Vertigo line, it is a comic book for adults. Not just because of the graphic violence, and graphic, if not quite pornographic, sex, but also because of the philosophical, psychological, and the historical content. Allusions to Aristotle and Allen Ginsberg's Howl are mixed with cultural references to Lee Iacocca, JFK, and Richard Milhous Nixon. Laced with post-modern irony throughout, we have a comedian with a very perverse sense of humor; a sociopath vigilante whose face is an ever shifting Rorschach pattern; a physicist endowed with strange powers after a tragic accident and ominously named Dr. Manhattan; and another who takes his name from the famous sonnet Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias: I don't mind being the smartest man in the world; I just wish it wasn't this one.<br />==========<br /><br />The climactic scenes of Watchmen take place in 1985, but it is a parallel universe to our reality with a few interesting twists: Masked and caped super heroes are a part of everyday life, and have been since before WWII. Nixon doesn't resign in disgrace after Watergate, but serves for three terms. Nixon uses Dr. Manhattan as a secret weapon to win the war in Viet Nam, and Viet Nam becomes the 51st state of the U.S. The U.S. is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia, and the tension is higher than it was at the height of The Cold War.<br /><br />--------------<br />Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II: What happened to us? What happened to the American Dream?<br />Edward Blake / Comedian: "What happened to the American Dream?" It came true! You're lookin' at it...<br />==========<br /><br />Though Alan Moore preemptively disowns all filmed adaptations of his work, I can't imagine a more faithful adaptation. I admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but that will soon change. Meanwhile, you can see that a lot of the storyboard shots were taken from the comic's panels, and not only the story, but the original artwork was respected. I love the look of the film, a kind of gritty realism that wove the superheroes seamlessly into the tapestry of their times. The 40's era scenes were true to their period, and likewise, the scenes in the 80's also captured the 80's zeitgeist. I love Nite Owl II's Owl Craft, the way it looked as it cruised over the city, those big round windows like the owl's eyes. The only false note for me was Dr. Manhattan sometimes looked like an animation superimposed over live action--which I suppose he was. Still you could tell that they used some very sophisticated special effects, trying some new things that almost worked, but most worked spectacularly well. And Dr. Manhattan, put on some pants!<br /><br />-------------------<br />Laurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre II: The most powerful thing in the universe... still just a puppet.<br />Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: We are all puppets, Laurie. I'm just the puppet who can see the strings.<br />==========<br /><br />I have to hand it to Director Zack Snyder and the cast. Especially Malin ?kerman as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II. The scenes where they suit up in their superhero costumes and cruise the night in the Owl Craft, which was for them a kind of aphrodisiac, were excellent. It brought to mind a similar scene in The Losers, also highly recommended, where Jeffery Dean Morgan (who plays The Comedian in Watchmen) and Zo? Saldana also use fighting as foreplay. Patrick Wilson not only captures the heat, he also portrays Dan Dreiberg as a stodgy middle aged fuddy duddy when he is not in his Nite Owl II costume. Malin ?kerman is excellent both here and in scenes with Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, who is growing increasingly distracted by the threat of a nuclear Armageddon, and more and more detached from any human connections. Laurie is a complicated woman, who also has major issues with her mother, Sally Jupiter / Silk Spectre, played by Carla Gugino. Don't even get me started on her Daddy issues.<br /><br />Still, when it comes to major issues, no one tops Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach. His name refers to the Rorschach inkblot test used in psychotherapy, and he wears a mask with an ever shifting Rorschach pattern on it. He doesn't call it a mask. He calls it his face. Rorschach channels his sociopathic urges into vigilante actions, like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Like Travis Bickle, he waits for that Someday. "Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets."<br /><br />-------------------<br />Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll whisper "no."<br />==========<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Matthew Goode as Ozymandias round out the band of Watchmen, and Alan Moore, though he has vowed never to watch the film, couldn't ask for a better portrayal of his characters. I was ready to write off Jeffrey Dean Morgan after first seeing him on Grey's Anatomy, especially when his character came back as a ghost, but thankfully I gave him a chance here. He was excellent as The Comedian, though he never told a single joke. Maybe that was the punch line. He is also a winner in The Losers.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Edward Blake / Comedian: Once you realize what a joke everything is, being the Comedian is the only thing that makes sense.<br />==========<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder made excellent choices in music, using several iconic songs that could almost be too powerful and distract or overwhelm the narrative were they not placed in exactly the right time and place. Three Dylan songs: Blowin' In The Wind done by Dylan, but All Along The Watchtower in the famous Jimi Hendrix version and Desolation Row done by My Chemical Romance. Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen has been used in countless films, but nowhere as appropriate as here. We also get 99 Luftballoons by Nena, The Sounds of Silence by Simon and Garfunkle, and Boogie Man by K.C. and the Sunshine Band! Get down tonight!<br /><br />-------------------<br />Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor... I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.<br />==========<br /><br />The bottom line is Watchmen is a very watchable movie that combines comic book action with deeper, more adult themes. In a perfect world it would be watched by more people, but it appeals strongly to its cult audience, kids who have grown up on comic books, and who still enjoy reading comic books, but demand a more sophisticated, grown up story.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: They claim their labors are to build a heaven, yet their heaven is populated by horrors. Perhaps the world is not made. Perhaps nothing is made. A clock without a craftsman. It's too late. Always has been, always will be. Too late.<br />==========<br /><br />Los Links:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO5M">Shutter Island</a> (2010) Jackie Earle Haley was George Noyce<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG99G8">The Losers</a> (2010) Jeffrey Dean Morgan was Clay<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300 (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2006) Directed by Zack Snyder<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FS9FCG">V for Vendetta (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2005) (based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQHXNW">Match Point</a> (2005) Matthew Goode was Tom Hewett<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX">Sin City</a> (2005) Carla Gugino was Lucille<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXI1">Death to Smoochy (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2002) Danny Woodburn was Angelo Pike<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXWJ">Spy Kids</a> (2001) Carla Gugino was Ingrid Cortez<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXMG">Almost Famous</a> (2000) Billy Crudup was Russell Hammond<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTUE4">The Day of the Locust</a> (1975) Jackie Earle Haley was Adore<br /><br />-------------------<br />Aristotle: "Pios tha filatei tus filakes?"

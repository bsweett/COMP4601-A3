I absolutely loved her previous film "Lost in Translation" (it has now become an absolute favorite) and my curiosity was peaked by the high energy trailers for the new film, that anachronistically mixed 18th century images with a '80s punk/pop soundtrack.<br /><br />Well, I wasn't disapointed. Once again Coppola has produced a wonderful film, that just takes your breath away with both it's beautiful 'in your face' cinematic visual imagery and an emotional character study of a young French Queen, who is primarily remembered by history for her materialistic extravagance and unfortunate end.<br /><br />Coppola's film (based on Antonia Frasier's biography "Marie Antoinette: The Journey") takes an impressionistic viewpoint of the young Queen. Marie (Kristin Dunst) is a beautiful, fifteen year old Hungarian princess, brought to the Court of Versailles to marry the equally young, Louis XVI. Her family wants the marriage to secure a Franco-Austrian alliance, while the French want her for one reason only...to produce an heir for the throne. Until she does this, her title and place within the socially/politically vicious French court is on unsound footing.<br /><br />The film follows Marie's emotional metamorphisis from a shy, lonely teenager to an extravagant young woman, who loves both high fashion and partying. She becomes the 'A' list celebrity of her day. Finally we see Marie become more reflective as a caring wife and mother. But by the time she finds maturity and some emotional closure in her life, the angry mobs of (unseen) peasants are at the palace gates.<br /><br />Once again Sofia Coppola produces a stunning film. Not unlike "Lost in Translation", she transports us to what seems like the caccoon of another world, where we follow the life of a lonely young woman. Everything about this film is brilliant. Kristin Dunst gives a great performance and really is the movie's emotional core. The supporting cast, which includes Jason Shwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis and Molly Shannon are quite good as well. I'm also impressed by the beautiful cinematography, art direction, costumes and locations.(Where are the multiple 'Academy Award' nominations?) All these aspects readily contribute to recreating the extravagance of the French Court. It's a visual feast for the eyes!<br /><br />Finally, I want to mention the vivacious, high energy soundtrack made up of mostly punk/pop songs of the eighties. Some critics have been negative about using this type of music for the film. But I really think it contributes to the portrayle of the boisterous spirit and wild lifestyles of the characters. If Marie Antoinette were alive today, she just might be listening to "Bow Wow Wow", while she drank champagne at some debauched party! (Sofia you can make a 'mix tape' for me any day!)<br /><br /> A great movie! Highly recommended! Can't wait for the next film!</p></body></html>

So after a box office failure with Mars Attacks!, he returns to the more gothic dark flavor which can be seen in Batman and Beetlejuice. Plotwise, it's not the best but visually it hits its mark.<br /><br />It's a pretty common story but as usual, Tim takes a story and changes it a bit. Here we have Ichabod Crane, a New York constable with ideas about experimental medical gadgets, he gets assigned to a small town called Sleepy Hollow, where grisly murders have taken place. People have been found decapitated, their heads missing.<br /><br />Arriving in the town, he finds himself not being really welcomed by the townsfolk who tend to have big secrets. But soon, Ichabod starts to learn and try to solve who's behind the murderer: a former Hessian mercenary who came back from the grave as the Headless Horseman.<br /><br />Before I get into the look, I have to mention the plot. You know that segment in a movie where the villain explains the plot and puts all of its small details into order? Well this has it and you're still like wtf? One character goes "five victims and four graves" and we know one was a woman. You already know why there's 5 isn't there? And yet they actually spend some minutes on this?<br /><br />Now for the look of the film. Sure it's not some spectacular landscape images or beautiful gardens, but oddly enough it looks beautiful. However there is one scene where Ichabod's mom in a flashback spins around and the camera pans around them. Great shot. One thing that isn't really here is his distinctive sense of humor. There's scenes that he might find hysterical but you're a little huh? After a kid asks someone if they know of the Headless Horseman, a woman does that finger across the neck and he goes "that'd be him." Ooh, knee slappingly funny.<br /><br />Johnny Depp proves he's still one of the better actors this generation with his portrayal of Ichabod as someone who thinks he's buff and macho but deep down he's quite squeamish and awkward. However he was little to no chemistry with Christina Ricci. And hey look: a bunch of Sith Lords in one movie. We got Ian McDiarmid(Emperor in Star Wars), Ray Park(Headless Horseman in fight scenes but he's Darth Maul) and Christopher Lee(Count Dooku but here he's Ichabod's superior).<br /><br />The film is rather suspenseful but not scary, quite gory but not vomit inducing. It's the kind of film that when there's no action or great looking scenery, you want the action and fortunately this has it.</p></body></html>

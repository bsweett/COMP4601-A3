<meta name="summary" content="Really Gross"></head><body><p>A lot of people keep calling this a Quentin Tarantino film.  He did not direct or write it.  It is written and directed by Eli Roth of Cabin Fever fame.  Quentin is his friend and encouraged him to make the movie, and signed on as a producer to help promote the film, but it is not a Tarantino film.  The film itself is an ultra violent film with tons of disturbing images.  If you are a 70's horror film fan, such as Last House on the Left, this is the modern day equivalent to it.  You have lots of sex and nudity, then some sick torture, and by the end, a nice revenge film.  For those who saw Cabin Fever, this film is even more extreme, and the humor of Cabin is left behind.  I really enjoyed the film, but I would not recommend it to anyone by a diehard horror film fan, or someone who wants to gross out a squeamish girlfriend.</p></body></html>

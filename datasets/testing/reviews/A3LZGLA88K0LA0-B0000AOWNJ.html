<meta name="summary" content="GIVE ME A RING SOMETIME?"></head><body><p>Several horror films of the past thirty years or so have become "classic" expressly due to their chilling atmosphere, unusual photography, and enigmatic endings:  "Carnival of Souls," "The Haunting", "The Others", to name a few.  Along comes this flashy terrorfest called "The Ring."  Admittedly, it has some truly disturbing and unsettling moments, including the strange death of a horse on the ferry boat; the emergence of a little girl from a well and through the t.v., to name only two.  Naomi Watts is very good as the heroine, looking somewhat like a younger version of both Nicole Kidman and the divine Lara Parker.  Martin Henderson has a boyish charm, yet soft machismo, that makes his Noah expand beyond the cardboard character he's given to play.  In the version we bought, ten minutes of some kind of "footage" are tapped on the end, without explaining exactly what this footage is or what it's doing on the tape.  Actually, some of the unused footage helps clarify the plot a little better.  The footage suggests that the video tape ends up in a video rental store; woe the viewer who watches this one.  And that's where this movie's strength truly lies---the horrifying video is so surreal and frightening, it's like watching your own worse nightmare come to life.<br />The cinematography, atmospheric music by Hans Zimmer, and a small cameo by the brilliant Jane Alexander, also help elevate this movie.  Watts is good to watch, there are plenty of scares; just wish I truly knew what the heck happened!<br />RECOMMENDED FOR TRUE FRIGHT FANS!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I love this movie!"></head><body><p>I really like the aging Diane Keaton ever so much more than I did the Annie Hall-ish, squirley younger Keaton with her annoying mannerisms. She is at her best in this laugh out loud (and sob out loud, as well) film. In fact, "Something's Gotta Give" is also a superb vehicle for the talent of Jack Nicholson. Were Keaton and Nicholson ever a real-life couple? I ask because there is such chemistry at work between the two!<br /><br />Real life--yes, that area where older men--wrinkled, weightier, and richer, date young women who still have dew on their skins. As Amanda Peet's character reminds him: "You don't date women over 30." The older (and larger) he is, the sillier he looks with these women. And intimacy? Do those young women really--well, you know.<br /><br />Am I saying that older men are repugnant? No, of course not, but the movie itself makes my point. Where is the comfort level for a couple in a relationship? Where is a real sharing of life? With the couple of similar ages, similar life styles, similar experiences, or the relationship in which one is trying to stay young and the other is seeking what?--riches, a good time, what?<br /><br />Jack's character Harry has never been in love and finds himself in a dither concerning what it might mean for his life. Give up those under-30's? For a woman his age? The initial idea of kissing Erica's (Keaton) less dewy mouth makes his face screw all up. Enter Keanu Reeves, a doctor who treats Jack's heart attack and becomes part of the triangle. The doctor has long admired Erica's talent as a very successful playwright, thoroughly familiar with her work. He is smitten.<br /><br />Reversing the older man/younger woman scenario to older woman/younger man is quite interesting. Keaton plays it for all it's worth. Reeve is an excellent casting choice here in making this combination work. (But Demi and Ashton have already shown us that.)<br /><br />When Harry meets Erica at her house on the shore (outside New York), he is there with her daughter, one of those dewy younger women, for their first-time experience. A heart attack stops the action, setting up a scenario for him to get to know a woman his age. Their sex scene (which reveals very little) is one of the two funniest sex scenes I've ever seen. (The other was Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson trying to imitate early television scenes in which one foot is always on the floor.) The scene is also poignant.<br /><br />When Harry returns to the city, Keaton believes they actually have something. When she sees him out with one of the dew creatures, she is heart-broken. I sobbed with her for the next few scenes (and every time I watch the movie again). Enter the doctor to mend her broken heart.<br /><br />Paris is the scene of reconciliation. Ah, Paris, that city of romance. The one false note of the film is Keanu's reaction to Harry and Erica.<br /><br />"Something's Gotta Give" is an excellent film which addresses issues of an aging population seeking love. Romance? You bet! Reconciliation? Oh yes! But first, something's gotta give!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great White Buffalo...great white buffalo"></head><body><p>If I understand the meaning behind the great white buffalo alluded to in HTTM, I can unequivocally say this film is in and of itself a great white buffalo.  From the title to the closing credits, this movie is an absurd, preposterous concept that absolutely works and had me crying tears of laughter.<br /><br />Four downtrodden, depressing friends get together for a wild male weekend full of cavorting and camaraderie at a ski resort.  This ski resort is special because it's where three of them had some of the most memorable experiences of their lives in the 80's, and the trip is meant to reinvigorate youthful momentum and break adult monotony.  Unfortunately, the resort is now in shambles, not nearly what they remember, and depressing as hell.  Not what they expected.  When the four decide to obnoxiously drunk in a hot tub, you know what happens next: They are transported back to their debaucherous and exciting 20-something lives of Winterfest '86 where they careened recklessly down the slopes, dove face first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C20VRS">Scarface</a>-style into mounds of drugs, and bedded bimbo ski bunnies dressed in atrociously colored yet wonderfully form-fitting 80's attire (spandex is a privilege, not a right).  The rest is side-splitting comedy, as the foursome must make every attempt to make their way "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXIDVI">Back to the Future</a>" while possibly righting past wrongs.<br /><br />The main cast (John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, Clarke Duke) is perfect together.  Tons of chemistry.  The supporting cast is just as good: Chevy Chase is the aloof hot tub repairman; William Zabka is the same character William Zabka always plays; and Crispin Glover is the oddball, one-armed* bellhop (a great touch considering his McFly roots in Back to the Future).  It's just too bad they couldn't find a bit role for Michael J. Fox.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the FACT that Rob Corddry absolutely steals every scene.<br /><br />With 80's references to pop-culture, music, fashion, politics, and everything else, the movie is packed full of hilarity.  When Robinson gets onstage to relive his musical glory days, I defy you not to bob your head and snicker at his "new" song.  When Corddry wakes up hungover in the hot tub and says hello to a squirrel in his own special way, there is no way you don't laugh.  And the "gag" joke between Zabka and Corddry is epic.  With the exception of the awkward insertion of a new love interest for John Cusack - a subplot never fully developed - the entire film is a compounded running joke that will evoke great memories for those who are fond of the era, mixed with various forms of laugh out loud comedy.  Add in an awesome soundtrack and a predictable yet completely fulfilling twist ending (it's the ultimate what if we all imagine if we were allowed to time travel), and this movie is easily the most enjoyable of the year.  While not quite on par with the cult status Hangover deserves, this film is very comparable, quotable, and hilarious.</p></body></html>

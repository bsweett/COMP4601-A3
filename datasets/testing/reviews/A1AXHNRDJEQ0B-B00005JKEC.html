<meta name="summary" content="TRAINING DAY"></head><body><p>The movie itself has a somehow perdictable story but the acting which is superb, lifts the story above its 'standard' plot.<p>Alonzo's intentions about Jake's 'Training Day' are not what Jake (and us) think they are at the beginning of the movie. Alonzo's original intentions seemed to be to shock him and corrupt him - he perceives Jake as innocent, and wants to have some 'fun' with him. A good example of that is what he says after the squad kills Roger - he's been plannig Jake's day for a week. That's obvious on a second watching: he made sure he'd have PCP laced weed pretty early in the day, and knows how to push Jake into smoking it - just to make sure he has something he can control Jake with if he needs to... But he hardly has to use it against Jake throughout the day: he's in total control, and knows the turf, and the 'street rules' - unlike Jake, who's new and too idealistic to unerstand them - at least at first. The 'Training Day' isn't meant to train Jake to join Alonzo's unit, but after it's over Jake has received some valuable training: how he can survive in the streets. Some of what he learns comes from Alonzo, but he manages to combine it with his own common sense - by taking the girl's wallet, he eventually manages to save his own life, even though Alonzo discourages him - after all, Alonzo's 'Street Justice' has been done. This goes against another one of Alonzo's lessons: don't show your sensitivities to the world. But by showing it in case of the girl - again, he manages to not only save his life, but to establish a connection with Smiley, which might help him later on.<p>As the day (and the movie) progresses, we see that Alonzo's attitude towards ake changes - he starts taking him seriously, until he realizes how much Jake doesn't fit in when they raid Roger's house. But he still doesn't take him seriously enough - when Jake comes by his house after survivng the poker game, Alonzo still tries to pretend that it was all a test, and having survived the experience made him get into the squad. But Alonzo hadn't realized that he'd taken it too far, just as he doesn't realize it about other events in his life - he thinks that the neighborhood's fear of him is respect, for instance. Or his son -the little boy trusts Jake after only one meeting more than Alonzo could ever hope for. And this time - Alonzo isn't able to use his charm or force as a policeman to get out of this situation...</p></body></html>

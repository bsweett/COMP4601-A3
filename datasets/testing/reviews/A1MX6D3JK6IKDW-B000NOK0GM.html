<meta name="summary" content="THE CRIME OF HARRY LIME"></head><body><p>Classic post World War 2 film, appropriately shot in black and white. This film seems to hold up better than most, but would tend to appeal mostly to collectors or cinematic students. Vienna in those days was partitioned much the same way as Berlin for a short time after the war, and Cotten is back trying to determine the fate of an old friend, Harry Lime. All reliable sources have Lime either dead or missing in another quadrant of Vienna. The police know Lime well, giving Cotten a tour of a local hospital, where Lime's racket of selling watered down penicillin at inflated prices has permanently ruined many lives, mostly children. The old friends meet on a ferris wheel, Lime admits his guilt, and soon it's Cotten and the police against Lime, accompanied by Director Reed's use of zither background music, which drives this reviewer crazy. The climax is grotesque and painful, but fits the entire tenor of the film. The story is well told, and the minor players, save for a whining tot, all play their roles well.This production is an old favorite of mine. Give it a try!(Obvious reporting error-Film was made in 1949, not 1933 as listed).</p></body></html>

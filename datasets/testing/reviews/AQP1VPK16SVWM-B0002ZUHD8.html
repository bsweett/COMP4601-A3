Fortunately, the stylish direction, sharp performances and flavor of the time saves this film from falling into &quot;TV movie&quot; territory. In this retelling of the Arthur legend, we're given a more &quot;realistic&quot; take on Arthur. Based on evidence that Arthur may have been a Roman soldier serving in Britian, we meet a man who values honor, democracy and always remains true to his knights. <p>Arthur and his knights are indentured servants forced to serve in the military for Rome. They've done their time and expect the new Bishop to provide them with papers giving them their freedom. The Bishop has other plans, however, and asks Arthur and his knights to go on what amounts to a suicide mission. They're charged with saving a Roman family surrounded by invading Saxons. To do this Arthur must travel through hostile territory where native Brits led by Merlin ambush and attack the Romans with regularity. <p>Arthur agrees because of his duty to Rome but also so he can see Lancelot, Gwain and the rest of his surviving knights (there are only six now)return to the homes they gave up when forced to serve Rome. <p>Well directed by Antoine Fuque, &quot;King Arthur&quot; follows in the wake of John Boorman's early 80's retelling &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Beyond the basic characters, there's little in common between the two films. That's to the former films advantage. The splendid action sequences and beautiful cinematography as well as the strong performances save &quot;King Arthur&quot; from becoming &quot;Robin Hood Price of Thieves&quot;. &quot;King Arthur&quot; compares well with other films looking at the same themes although the characters are sketchy at best and we're never given any background on any character except for Arthur and Lancelot. The other knights kind of melt into the background because of this. <p>&quot;King Arthur&quot; provides an enjoyable evening of entertainment but it isn't without some severe flaws. Luckily, the talent of the director, cast and the production values overcome any shortcomings in the bold, imaginative but underwritten script.</p></body></html>

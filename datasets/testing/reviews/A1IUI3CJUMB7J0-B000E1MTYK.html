<meta name="summary" content="The best harry movie yet..the best movie of 2005"></head><body><p>Great from start to finish. It's rare that a movie series gets better as it goes on. The first movie was great, the second was not as good as the first but still great, the third one was better then the second but not was good as the first and this one beats them all. I loved it from start to finish and I did not really enjoy the book I found it long and  borning. The movie cuts lots from the book but that's good the book was boring. The acting is great and the story was great. The story is more grown up, scary and the ending is just excellent. When the movie ended I was so mad becouse I did not want it to end. The best movie of 2005.</p></body></html>

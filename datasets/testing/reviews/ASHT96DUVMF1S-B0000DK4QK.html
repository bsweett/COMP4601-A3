<meta name="summary" content="It was Hell to watch"></head><body><p>At first seeing the previews for From Hell I thought of a great movie depiciting the murders of Jack the Ripper.  This movie falls short of anything to do with Jack the Ripper.  From Hell is about Depps drug addiction and his love for a hooker.  Both the Characters and the plot are thin as paper.  Small bits of info are given throughout the movie leading to nothing. I and my friends were completely bored.  Once people start getting up and begin talking you know a movie has fallen short of what it set out to accomplish. I keep looking at my watch just waiting for it to end.  Rent but only in need of a movie.</p></body></html>

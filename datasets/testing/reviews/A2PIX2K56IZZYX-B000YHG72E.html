<meta name="summary" content="Very cute, very funny..................."></head><body><p>I forgot how much I liked this movie until just watching it a 2nd time. It's quite funny and very charming. Let's face it, there are so many bad holiday movies, so it's always a welcome surprise when you find one thats as good as this one is. Plus, it's one of those rare occurences when both children and adults can watch a movie and have a good time. Watching this helped me forgive Will Ferrell for Bewitched and Melinda and Melinda, his last two movies that really stunk. He is perfect here, innocent, hilarious, very fun.<br /><br />Will Ferrell obviously has a gift for physical comedy, but his delivery in "elf' was right-on, his sadness when he realizes most people's X-mas spririt generally sucks was perfect, and the chemistry he has with his real father, played well by James Caan , is wonderfull. You see Buddy (Will Ferrell) was an orphan baby raised by elves, mostly by Papa Elf played perfectly dead-pan by Bob Newhart, but he feels he does not fit in with the rest of the elves so he heads to New York City to find his real dad.<br /><br />Upon arrival in the Big Apple, Buddy goes through all kinds of mis-adventures, all very funny and sometimes sweet and sappy, but thats ok here, it fits and does not feel thrown in our faces like most holiday fare. He finds his dad is on the naughty list and also helps Santa (Ed Asner, great casting by the way) get the world back into some Christmas Spirit. Buddy also finds some time to fall in love with a department store elf he works with played lovingly by Zooey Deschanel, whom I am really starting to enjoy, this is the 3rd movie I've seen her in, and I like where she is heading.<br /><br />So, great cast, lots of laughs, harmless fun, any problems you ask? Not really, Mary Steenburgen plays James Caan's wife and she  really didn't provide much, she used to be such a good actress, but as of late it seems, um, lacking....? Also at only 95 minutes, this could have been a little longer, maybe show us more Buddy trying to 'get' New York, but over-all, not a whole lot to complain about.<br /><br />So, here is the perfect night's viewing for you and your kids if you ware looking for an X-mas night 1.Elf 2.Polar Express 3.Nestor the Long-Eared Donkey 4.The Little Drummer Boy, and finish it up with It's a Wonderfull Life, I'm telling you people this is fool-proof, great viewing, I promise.<br /><br />Happy Holidays!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />acting...........4 stars, Ferrell and Caan are magnificent<br /><br />directing........4 stars, Jon Favreau (Swingers, Made) does comedies very well.<br /><br />special effects.....4 stars, X-mas settings are beautifull, as are the North Pole shots<br /><br />comedy rating......4.5 stars, I laughed alot, Bob Newhart is priceless!!!<br /><br />quality...........4.5 stars, Simple yet a joy to watch</p></body></html>

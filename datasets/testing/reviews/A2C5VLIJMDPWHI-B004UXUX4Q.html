In the beginning of the movie, it made me wish I was back in Maui because of the beautiful scenes and music. Then the movie started and it went downhill from there. Most of what I saw was about two incredibly bratty kids (one a college student) who curse, throw up their middle fingers, disrespect their father and think it's OK to completely ignore anything he says. Then the college student brought along her incredibly tacky guy friend who thinks jokes about mentally challenged people and the elderly are funny. That's in addition to making fun of a grandmother with Alzheimer's and not knowing how to greet a friend's father. I liked watching George Clooney, but the rest of this film was a waste of my time. By 56 minutes I gave up. I thought it was ridiculous to try to find the "other man" to let him know Clooney's character's wife was about to have the plug pulled. When I think of good movies that fight to get filming money and then see this kind of stuff make it to the big screen, I realize time and time again how Hollywood gets it wrong. I don't even care what the ending was. I didn't like any character but Clooney's and got tired of people chatting with him about Hawaiian property. If I was him in this movie, I'd pull the plug on myself. I definitely could've given this movie a better shot if the supporting actors' personalities weren't so irritating. The only thing that I applauded was the grandfather who gave the irritating family friend a black eye. Go Grandad! You needed more characters like him and less characters like the daughters and the friend. Then I'd have watched the other hour.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek: Let's Do A Zombie Movie"></head><body><p>This movie soars above the previous outing in film-making quality, writing, action and just about any way you can think of. It is also much darker, contributing to this outing becoming the first movie in the Star Trek series to receive a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />Taking a page from the lesson learned from The Wrath of Khan, they decide to bring back a known foe: the Borg. Granted, each time we meet the Borg, it is a different group, thus not necessarily qualifying as a simple recurring villain, but given the hive-minded nature of the Borg, it makes little difference. They are all basically programed to behave the same. However, while TWoK showed Captain Kirk being pursued by a man who felt wronged by him (even quoting Captain Ahab in his last moments before dying), here we see our beloved Captain Picard take on the role of Ahab in his personal quest for vengeance against the cybernetic whale that had crippled him so many years ago. (Again, "Moby Dick" is brought up specifically in this movie too.)<br /><br />As a first motion-picture outing for director Jonathan Frakes (who had directed several episodes of the series), this more than satisfies. In coming up with a directorial style for this movie, he watched movies like Alien, Jaws, 2001, Close Encounters, etc. and it shows. He more than competently creates a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere, yet still manages to appropriately work in bits of humor (a standard of Star Trek).<br /><br />The effects are great, the performances top notch and the DVD is a must have.</p></body></html>

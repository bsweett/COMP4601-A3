The story surrounding a young girl possesed by a demon is a true good vs evil story that will scare the hell out of you in the process. The actors,Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, (all recieved Oscar nominations) are at thier best. This movie is not for the weak of heart. It is a scary, powerful, movie. I saw this when it was re-released and it was just a powerful. If you have never seen this film rent, or buy it, today.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting telling of the tale, slow to get going."></head><body><p>I have no idea how historically accurate this movie is but it does have an interesting take on the old legends.<br /><br />The level of detail was interesting, the plot wasn't to bad either- just took upwards of half the movie to really get going.<br /><br />If the movie is historically accurate Arthur's knights were a people called Sarmatians but the look of their recruitment scenes (drafting?)and the use of the term "Rus", made me think of what is today Russia. That's quite a change from the usual idea of being from what is now Britain.<br /><br />I noticed several men wearing what I'd call a buzz haircut, kind of a long stubblecut- I don't think that can be accurate given the haircutting tools they'd have had.<br /><br />The story is interesting , Arthur & his men have fulfilled their enlistment agreement and on the day they were due to go free they get one last mission. They are sent north of Hadrians's Wall (that is an impressive set) to rescue a Roman family from the advancing enemy ( I think it was the Woads- Celtic Britons, not the Saxons who are also invading Britian). Arthur and his men aren't at all impressed with the family but they do their duty and bring them south, along with their worker's families and some captive Woads (Guinevere is one of these)which Arthur has freed.<br /><br />Back at the base Arthur decides to remain behind in Britain due to his disgust with what Rome has become (the depiction of the supposedly Christian Romans may offend some but the actions shown are similar to what some early types really did do). Having already defeated the advancing Saxons in one battle in the run to the south Arthur and the Woad people get ready for another battle, this time at Hadrian's Wall. Arthur's men return in time to help out, this is where the movie really gets going- something over an hour into running time. It's a big battle, look at the DVD extra stuff on it, and Arthur is of course victorious.<br /><br />I liked the look of the sets, and of most costuming, the battles looked very well done, I even liked the way many details of the Arthurian legend were worked into the plot ( just differently enough to be something believably and gradually changed over time).<br /><br />I found it hard to accept that Arthur and his men did not wear anything on their heads until the big battle, no matter how hard they fought or how cold it was. I also didn't like their camping out in some freezing woods without any real weather protection. The Woad women going into battle, no problem except for the tops they wore, I think those people would likely have gone into battle bare chested -men or women.<br /><br />I found it interesting that there was no swearing, surprisingly little blood or flying body parts ( was that to help the rating and film budget?).<br /><br />The movie is all right, just slow going, I may skip most of the first half the next time I watch it.</p></body></html>

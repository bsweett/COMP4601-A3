For those who haven't heard the plot a million times already, I'll recap. The Dreamettes, fronted by belter Effie (Jenifer Hudson, totally earning that Oscar) catch a lucky break and start working as singers for a fading James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy, a revelation as a mash-up of sixties soul singers from Wilson Picket to James Brown to Marvin Gaye). The ersatz Berry Gordy character Curtis Taylor Jr (a lackluster Jamie Foxx) decides to move the less powerful but prettier Deena Jones (Beyonce, giving an eerie Diana Ross impersonation) to the front of the newly christened Dreams. As the sixties and seventies cascade about them, the conflict between these four drives the movie and the music.<br /><br />Fortunately for "Dreamgirls," the musical performances carry the day. I don't find many of the songs here to be all that memorable - other than "One Night Only" and "Cadillac Car," I have a hard time humming any of these once the DVD is over. But to see Hudson bring the house down with her version of the original centerpiece "And I'm Telling You Now I'm Not Going" is an astonishing career-maker of a scene, and Murphy steals the show just about every number he does. (As for all the Theatre Snobs decrying Hudson Vs Holliday, did you ever stop to think about how few people actually SAW the play with Holliday in it? Like, over 20 years ago? It's like saying the current stage play of "Mary Poppins" will never be right because Julie Andrews isn't in it.)<br /><br />THAT grouse aside, "Dreamgirls" is not without its flaws. As previously stated, Jamie Foxx seems miscast here. While Murphy is brilliant, the wide range of styles he's run through (from James Brown bark to Marvin Gaye 'message song' croon) seems unwieldy for the character. Anika Noni Rose is bubbly and fun, but gets little by way of memorable scenes. With those out of the way, I still enjoyed this. Watch for the cameos from John Lithgow and Loretta Devine (Lorrell Robinson in the original Broadway production) as the jazz singer in the wake scene.<br /><br />I am happy to see "Dreamgirls" as the success it's become. It gives me hope that the Movie Musical genre that has been given shots in the arm via "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QZ7U">Moulin Rouge!

Now do I have to say that this contains some of Danny Elfman's most fantastic music. This is absolutely incredible. The stop-motion animation featured here is so much better than the crappy CGI animation found in "Chicken Little," "Kung Fu Panda," etc. The songs are quite catchy, and I find myself humming them after I see the movie, and listen to the soundtrack. The character designs are spectacular and purely Burtonesque (even though Burton didn't direct this film). It's a fantastic movie, and it first both Halloween and Christmas respectively.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></body></html>

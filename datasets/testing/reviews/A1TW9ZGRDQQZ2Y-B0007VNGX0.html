<meta name="summary" content="Wasn't a big fan of the first RE film, but this one is good!"></head><body><p>I just got back from seeing this film and it was way better than I thought it would be. I thought the first Resident Evil was okay, but Apocalypse is an even better action/horror film. This movie really flies by with an action scene occuring about every five minutes or so. This film is not brain candy, but eye candy like this is always a treat to me. The action scenes are well done even though the gore is tamed down a bit (don't worry there is still blood and tons of violence). Milla Jovovich returns and really plays Alice tough, yet sexy at the same time. Who would have thought a skinny model would make a great female action star? Sienna Guillory is even sexier in my opinion as Jill Valentine and I'll look forward to seeing more of her in the third RE film. Oded Fehr is a pretty good actor and will have you rooting for him and Mike Epps steals the show with some funny lines. I'd say almost everybody in the theater I saw it with seemed to say good things about it as they were walking out. I really didn't expect to like it that much, but I truly had a great time. I think it is just as good as the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead and the improved CGI over the crummier effects of the first film is a big plus as well. A must see on the BIG screen for all action fans who want to see two attractive female leads kick butt!</p></body></html>

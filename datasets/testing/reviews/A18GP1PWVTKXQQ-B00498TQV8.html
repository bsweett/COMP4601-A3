<meta name="summary" content="Meth replaces Moonshine in this updated tale of hillbilly stereotypes"></head><body><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Wikipedia informs us that the classic 'hillbilly' stereotype began during the Great Depression. The image was one of "the poor, ignorant, feuding family with a huge brood of children tending the family moonshine still." Filmed in the Ozark Mountains, 'Winter's Bone' continues to advance the same stereotype--this time however, the 'hillbillies' are not making moonshine but rather cooking up the more deadly brew of methamphetamine.<br /><br />When we're first introduced to the film's protagonist, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), she's taking care of her almost catatonic mother and two much younger siblings. The family is so destitute that at one point they shoot squirrels and eat them. One wonders why no social services agency becomes involved with this family. After all, the local sheriff is quite familiar with the family's situation--that Ree, a 17 year old minor, is caring for the younger siblings and the mother is a virtual basket case. Wouldn't the sheriff have been obligated to report the family situation to social services so they could be placed in foster care? After all, if something happens to those kids and law enforcement was found to know about it, they could be held liable along with the county for not calling in various helpful authorities.<br /><br />The inciting incident occurs early on when a bail bondsman informs Ree that she has a week to find her meth-selling father who has used the family home as collateral to be released on bond. Ree seeks help from various relatives including 'Teardrop', her uncle, who at first wants nothing to do with finding brother Jessup, Ree's dad. Teardrop's strategy is to intimidate his niece, so that she won't get into trouble when the meth dealers get upset over her snooping around trying to find her father. It's established early on that people in town are scared of Uncle Teardrop due to his deep-seated anger management problem (Teardrop likes to smash car windows and refuses to get out of his own vehicle when ordered by the police).<br /><br />Ree eventually contacts other members of the community who she is supposedly distantly related to. One of these men is Thump who heads a group of meth-dealing bad guys.  He gets the word out that Ree should not be snooping around but she won't listen.  Because of the hillbilly code, he ends up sending the womenfolk to beat Ree up. Finally Teardrop levels with Ree, explaining that her father was killed because he was an informer. I had a hard time believing that Thump and his men didn't kill Ree outright as she was doing all that snooping around. You would think that meth dealers wouldn't give a hoot about some old hillbilly code about not hurting a woman. And then despite the fact that they outnumber Teardrop, Thump and his men somehow accept his word that Ree won't snitch. Unlikely. And then they capitulate and send the womenfolk to cut off Ree's father's hand, as proof that he's dead. And here his daughter accepts that? The point I guess is that people are so intimidated by meth dealers, that their spirit is completely crushed. So Ree makes a 'deal with the devil' in order to save the family. You've got to assume that law enforcement is so totally corrupt that they look the other way in every case. Here, Ree assumes the police know about what's happening and will take no action. So there's not one good person in law enforcement who might try to do something? So they're all completely intimidated and ineffectual? No higher authorities become involved in cases like these?<br /><br />Sure there are cases where people are intimidated and refuse to cooperate with law enforcement. But if everyone did that, the vast majority of criminals would get away with their crimes. So you have to buy this whole scenario and I have trouble doing that.<br /><br />The problem with 'Winter's Bone' is that most of the hillbillies are creepy, malevolent figures, reminiscent of some of the unpleasant characters in the film 'Deliverance'. Ree comes off as hardly heroic, refusing to rat out her father's killers in a desperate bid to save her family.  It's understandable but nothing to cheer about.  Similarly, we're asked to sympathize with Teardrop too as he's saved his niece from the clutches of murderers--but he too is complicit in his brother's murder.<br /><br />'Winter's Bone' was directed by Debra Granik, a Columbia film professor. She is to be admired for using some local talent during the filming and does a fine job in getting good work out of her director of photography and editors. Nonetheless, her big mistake was deciding to adapt the source material, a novel which apparently promotes the idea that there is a community in the Ozarks who are completely unlikeable and have little or no redeeming qualities, due to their association with the methamphetamine trade. Even if we accept the idea that there is an underclass of such people, how about humanizing those characters by giving them some kind of personality, instead of depicting them as suffering from a terminal case of uncontrollable hostility?</p></body></html>

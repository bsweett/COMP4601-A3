Ultimately, this isn't a plot-driven thriller - it's the story of a man who is given the chance to take a stand and thereby prove to himself that he has what it takes to change his life.  For that kind of story, plot runs a distant second to character - and there's absolutely nothing formulaic about Stuart Beattie's wonderfully original characters, nor the ways in which Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx bring them so vividly to life.  The strength of characterization in the writing and performances is phenomenal (check out how much we learn about Max in the cab depot before he says even a single word).  Tom Cruise might be all over the posters for this movie - and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in seeing him play a mesmerizingly ruthless bad guy - but Jamie Foxx is the real star.  He walks the line between strength and vulnerability so expertly you never know which side of it he's likely to fall.  The situations Beattie's script puts them in are wonderfully unsettling, the dialogue is crisp and intelligent, and the music and editing conspire perfectly to create an experience which is horribly unnerving but never less than totally compelling.  Mann's visual style is typically excellent, giving L.A. both its dreamlike expansiveness and gritty immediacy.  It's an utterly unromantic vision of the city, yet it makes you want to go there right now.  That's the touch of a great director.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It Holds Up Very Well"></head><body><p>"Laura" (1944) has a tour de force performance by Clifton Webb and a so-so undistinguished outing by Vincent Price. It's a classic movie detective story of the film noir genre with its haunting iconic theme music of the title song. Gene Tierney is the murder victim, and Dana Andrews is the detective, Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, who falls in love with the deceased. Webb plays Waldo Lydecker, a snide, nasty columnist and radio broadcaster who can make or break careers.<br />Price is a gigolo named Shelby, a Southern smoothie, who is beloved by Ann Treadwell played by the noted actress Judith Anderson who became famous for her portrayal of Euripides's Medea.<br />The movie in black and white holds up very well, and has a solid plot although some of the alibis get convoluted at times--especially Vincent Price's. It's Hitchcockian which is all to the good. It's based on a Vera Caspary novel.<br />It's rather strange that Dana Andrews does all his investigating without a partner, travels in cabs, and that he lets Webb tag along while interviewing suspects. To Andrews women are dames or dolls which makes him crude in Lydecker's eyes. Laura's successful career in advertising was the result of Lydecker's sponsorship.<br />Make sure you stay with it for the last twenty minutes because it becomes very suspenseful and is cleverly worked out. It's ell worth seeing or revisiting.</p></body></html>

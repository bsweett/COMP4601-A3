<meta name="summary" content="Best Arnold movie ever!"></head><body><p>Is it me, or has Arnold's acting skills gone down hill over the years? He did a fine acting job in predator, but his movies since then, you almost wonder if he ever had any experience acting at all. I know that we all say, hey it's arnold, he doesn't need to be an oscar winning actor to be popular and likeable. All his movies, and corny calling card lines like I'LL BE BACK, doesn't change the fact that his movies are mainly "action". Blowing things up, shooting bad guys, chopping arms off, and yes he has done some extremly odd movies, such as "junior" (Oh my i'm almost ashamed to mention that I've seen it. It was horrible.) He should have just stuck to what he is good at. And that is sci-fi/action-thrillers such as PREDATOR. You still can enjoy predator to this day. The most unforgettable scene is when the alien takes his mask off for arnold. The face looked so real. It was all like moist, and freckled, and his teeth were shiny and yellow, and his gums were pink with saliva and he had that disgusting triple opening type jaw. And teeth both inside and outside of his mouth. How did they pull off such genius make up effects, or even the face itself. That is one hell of an imagination. If you saw this film for the first time, without knowing the date of when it was made, you'd never believe the date was 1987. I don't even believe it. I also think that the action music added to the intensity. I miss these type of movies. How can anyone say the 80's sucked. Like 90 percent of all my favorite movies were made in the 80's, and they were so creative that writers copy the ideas to this day. Of course we can't forget the occasional corny 80's flicks, but you can't say no good movies were made in the 80's. This is by far the best alien movie ever. The writer obviously knew about predatorial behavior. IE. when the alien is eating his dinner, and he rips out the flesh of that guy, and screams into the darkness like a hungry wolf. The fact that his main advantage is he can camoflauge himself like many animals can do in the jungle (changing color when they feel thereatened to blend in with the jungle.) It's as if the alien was made for the jungle. Next, tracking the soldiers by their body heat. Like snakes do. Rapid movement and body heat. But then you know he is from outer space because of his heavily equipped body, weapons, aimers, controllers, lasers, knives. You almost stop believing that they can even kill it. And at the end when arnold discovers he too can be invisible with mudd, was GENIUS. Too bad he falls in the pond and it all washes off. The guy who played the alein was this big and tall black guy. I forget his name but he also had a small part in the movie i think, as himself. He must of been hella hot in that space outfit. This will always be one of my favorite movies. I saw it when i was a kid, and still love it. It's entertaining, funny, scary, intelligent, intense, and a classic. It is great.</p></body></html>

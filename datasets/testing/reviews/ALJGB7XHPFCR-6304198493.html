<meta name="summary" content="This movie is Orca Fat (pretty darn good)"></head><body><p>This is the unique story of 5 criminals and an anonymous crime lord. This movie is a masterpiece with an amazing ironic climax.  A few may say the movie is wierd or complicated, but they just didn't understand the thing.  The Usual Suspects is not your usual film, and will probably need a second viewing in order to fill in the gaps in your mind as well as the questions that hit you time after time. This story is great because the plot does nothing but puzzle you for the entire duration of the movie, then in the last 2 minutes most of your questions are answered and you can lean back in your seat holding your head thinking &quot;what a great movie that was, but I think I have to watch it again because there was something I didn't quite understand&quot;. No matter how many times you watch it, you always seem to pickup something you didn't quite understand or catch the last time. The scenes don't get boring, the action doesn't just jump in at the opening scene, the films is filled with those catchy film dialogues that are nothing but great, and the climatic twist will leave most of you banging your heads with frustration because you had no idea what was coming to you. The well-chosen cast sinks into the plot and is so well constructed and believable that you're going to hope its all fiction. This movie is ironic, suspenseful, mysterious, classic and most importantly, cool. This film is a classic that we can compare all other movies to.</p></body></html>

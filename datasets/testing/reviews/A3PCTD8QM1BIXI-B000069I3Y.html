<meta name="summary" content="Nice movie with a crap ending."></head><body><p>Channging Lanes is one of few films that can start out great and then have a crappy enidng. After one leaves the film you still liked though.Roger Michell who previsouly directed Nottitng Hill does good with this little thriller and Ben Affleck & Samuel L. Jackson are good in the leads. The screenplay by first timer Chap Taylor is also very good however I do wish that the ending that was originally involved Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson getting into a fist fight that leads onto the balcony was used but hey the world ain't perfect.</p></body></html>

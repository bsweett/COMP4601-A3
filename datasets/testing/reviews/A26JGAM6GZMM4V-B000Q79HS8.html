<meta name="summary" content="A worthy sequel"></head><body><p>Crisply directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, this film offers almost constant high-speed action. As in The Bourne Identity, the young protagonist suffers from amnesia. His nightmares, hallucinations, and mini-epiphanies have yet to reveal all that he wants to know about himself and especially his past. He does know, however, that he was once involved as a highly-skilled assassin in a "black ops" project (code name Treadstone) sponsored by the C.I.A. As this sequel begins, Bourne and companion Maria Kreutz (Franka Potente) are happily settled in a seaside village in India, presumably out of harm's way. And then....<br /><br />Tony Gilroy's screenplay is based on the second of three novels written by Robert Ludlum which comprise "The Bourne Trilogy." The acting by members of the supporting cast (notably Joan Allen and Brian Cox) is consistently first-rate. Credit Oliver Wood and Dominic Watkins with the cinematography and production design which recreate violent, often deadly encounters in various locations through which Bourne flees or pursues his adversaries. He eventually establishes his "supremacy" but at a substantial cost as the film ends. I now await the adaptation of The Bourne Ultimatum, hopeful that it sustains the same high level of quality in terms of storytelling, acting, and production values. That said, I agree with others who have noted the lack of variety in the pace of plot in The Bourne Supremacy, and, the need for character development in greater depth. On balance, however, I think this is a highly entertaining film.</p></body></html>

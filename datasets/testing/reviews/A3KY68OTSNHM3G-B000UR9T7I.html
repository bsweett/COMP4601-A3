Peter's life is going very well; he's doing well in school and his relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) couldn't be better.  Plus, he's just saved the police chief's daughter from certain death.  Now, he's being awarded the key to the city.  Life couldn't be much better, right?  Wrong!<br /><br />Harry Osborne (Franco) still blames Spiderman for the death of his father.  So, Harry's taken on a persona of his own as the New Goblin.  He and Spiderman fight it out over New York, but Spiderman managed to knock Harry off of his futuristic surfboard.  Harry ends up in the hospital with a loss of memory.  For the moment, Harry doesn't remember anything of his encounter with Spiderman, and he and Peter become friends again (or so it seems).<br /><br />Peter learns more about the death of his uncle.  He finds out that the man who was arrested for the killing was not the killer at all.  The real killer turns out to be Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church).  He escapes from prison and flees from the police, but something happens to him as he's fleeing.  He runs into some sort of physics lab where his bodily chemistry is altered.  He can now assume shapes in the sand and turns once again to crime.  He and Spiderman have several run-ins, and he's given the name Sandman.<br /><br />Peter is also going through changes of his own.  Some symbiotic being has attached itself to Peter's Spiderman suit.  It gives him a new sense of strength and power, but it also takes its toll on Peter mentally.  He's become stronger, but he's also become more abrasive and brash.  Mary Jane has noticed the change in Peter, and she's feeling more distanced from him.  Mary Jane decides to visit Harry, and they share a kiss.  Mary Jane runs from the house, but the kiss has triggered Harry's memory.  He again goes searching for Spiderman.  The two fight it out, and Spiderman leaves Harry for dead.<br /><br />Another enemy for Spiderman emerges in this film.  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is a new reporter selling pictures to Peter's newspaper.  J.J. Jameson likes Eddie's pictures better than Peter's and tells Eddie if he can find a picture of Spiderman "with his hands in the cookie jar", he'll get the open reporter position on the paper.  Eddie submits a picture to J.J. of Spiderman holding a bag of money in front of a bank, and J.J. gives him the job.  Peter finds out and claims that the picture is a fake.  The paper finds out that the picture is indeed a fake, and Eddie is fired.  He vows revenge against Peter.  Eddie goes to church and hears noises from the bell tower.  The noise is Peter trying to rid himself of the symbiote.  The symbiote falls on Eddie and soon, he has transformed into Venom; a villian intent on destroying Spiderman.<br /><br />Soon, Sandman and Venom have teamed up in an effort to destroy Spiderman.  Eddie has captured Mary Jane and placed her 80 stories above the ground inside a taxi cab.  Peter sees the events unfolding on television and goes to help.  He first stops at Harry's house to ask for his help, but Harry doesn't give in (by this time, Harry's butler has told him the truth about his father's death).  So, Spiderman goes off to fight the two  villains alone.  Will Mary Jane survive?  Will Harry come to help Spiderman?<br /><br />I thought this was the best of the Spiderman movies so far.  The acting is great and its always nice to have the same actors continue with their roles in sequels.  There is a lot of action and characters to keep track of in this movie, but everything is tied up at the end.  The ending leaves the door wide open for a fourth installment, which I'm sure will be coming soon.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and see if Spiderman can defeat the new villians as well as the enemy within himself.</p></body></html>

This time, we have a remake with Anthony Hopkins (as Daddy Talbot) and Benecio De Toro (as Laurence Talbot), plus some special effects that we not available in the old days.<br /><br />We begin on a full-moon night in England, in 1891.  Daddy Talbot's other son is walking through a wooded area and attacked by a horrible monster that slashes him apart.  The Talbot man's fianc&eacute; writes his brother (Larry), who is living in New York.  Expressing concern for her fiance's disappearance, she asks Larry for his help.<br /><br />Larry arrives at the family estate, an old English manor in disrepair and finds his estranged father alive and well, accompanied by the family dog and a man-servant from India.  The son/brother's body had just been recovered.  Larry travels through the English countryside to a small town to see his brother's body, which is being kept in a meat house pending the burial service.  Of course, Larry has to pull back the sheet, and sees the body looking pretty bad.<br /><br />Back at the family estate, Larry begins having flashbacks about seeing his mother dead from what appeared to be a suicide when he was a young boy.  After her death, Daddy sent him to an asylum for a year and then sent him off to live with a relative in New York.<br /><br />Larry is determined to find the beast that attacked his brother and decides to visit the gypsy camp one night. (Duh--would you go out at night when you knew there was a werewolf in the area and it was a full-moon night to boot?  I hope Larry doesn't tell "blond" jokes :-).  Of course, you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to guess that Larry gets attacked and bitten by the wolfman.  And so it begins--once bitten. . .<br /><br />Larry is sewn up by the gypsy woman and returns home.  A Scotland Yard detective shows up at the manor to investigate and a few unpleasant comments are expressed by both men.  Shortly afterwards, Larry begins to change.  He has some scary nightmares and he begins to develop sight, hearing, and smelling sensitivities.  His body begins to change before our eyes one night and he goes on a killing spree.  The change is done well, too.  Needless to say, the local villagers are severely spooked and the story continues to reveal some additional information.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie.  I thought it was well done and added a few new things just to keep the story fresh.  Anthony Hopkins was wonderful in his part, but don't let this worn-out but classy gentleman act fool you.  He is a not a very nice guy.  Benecio De Toro was also wonderful in his role.  The orchestra music added to the film and the visual effects were wonderful.  There were also some nice scenery shots of London and the English countryside.<br /><br />This is NOT a movie for your young and impressionable children.  There is blood, guts and gore for shock value, murders, and asylum torture.  Heads and body parts are ripped off and people are gashed open.  Your children will have nightmares over this stuff.  If you can take that stuff yourself, then this was a really good movie.  (Normally, I won't go to this kind of violent film either, but, I grew up with the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula stories, so I had to see it.)</p></body></html>

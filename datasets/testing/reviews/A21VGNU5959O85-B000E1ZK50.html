There were so many things wrong with it. Dracula had a draconian mullet pulled back in a banana clip in a world where we have come to know dracula as a smooth talking, handsome smart coffin dweller, this one must be a distant cousin who crawled out of the compost heap behind the trailor park, Hello he has to kill all the Valarius family and doesnt just take them out when they are sleeping at night? The CGI was laughable, Dr Jeckl was supposed to be, according to the "behind the scenes" guys the "most realistic CGI ever made" AHAHAHAHA, they have got to be joking. They dont explain why Draculas nasty little children who reside in Gremlin rip off sacks of goo, need to be electrified to live. Hugh Jackman is a talented actor as well as Kate is a great actress but both of their characters wouldnt stand a chance against the Awesome personalities of Selene from underworld or Wolverine from X-men. I guess they had to work with the crappy juvenile script they were given. Van Helsing is a wreck all around, reinventing myths and ehem sucking the life out of great characters.</p></body></html>

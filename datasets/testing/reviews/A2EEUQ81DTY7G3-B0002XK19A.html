This movie. However, proves to be even better than its predecessor. Two years on, Mary Jane, played by the lovely Kirsten Dunst, has gotten on with her acting career, and is dating an astronaut. But she is still pining for the man that she wants Peter Parker to be. Peter, played with an fresh-faced ease by Tobey Maguire, is having a terrible time - having been fired twice from a pizza-delivery service, and at the Daily Bugle for not taking enough photos of Spider-Man. He's also in trouble from his college professor for being lazy and for not doing his homework. <p>Meanwhile, Aunt May, played with a delectable veracity by the wonderful Rosemary Harris, is being thrown out of her apartment, and poor Peter thinks he caused it all, including the strain on his friendship with young Harry Osborn who holds Spider-Man responsible for the death of his father. When Peter visits Alfred Molina's devilish Dr. Otto Octavius a scientist who is researching fusion, he witnesses one his experiments running out of control. Changing into Spiderman, Peter witnesses Dr. Octavius turn into a raving monster, complete with robotic malevolent tentacles. Spurned on by the unfortunate death of his wife, Octavius tries to wreak havoc on the whole of Manhattan.<p>Spider-Man 2 has all manner of fancy CGI improvements on its precursor, but in the end it's the old-style action sequences that carry it, along with the continued development of the characters. The movie is also gorgeous to look at - the colours are vibrant and rich, and Manhattan looks just beautiful. The film also has a strong sense of pacing, with the quieter moments of repose between MJ and Peter juxtaposed well with frantic rapidity of the action. There are some great effect scenes, particularly when Aunt May swats Octavius with her umbrella as he scrambles up the side of a building. There's also a climactic scene involving an elevated train where Spider man tries to stop it from crashing into the East River.  <p>Kirsten Dunst brings a quiet, feline beauty to the role and there's no doubt that she's a remarkably adventurous young actress who is going to go a long way in Hollywood.  Dunst invests the lovely M.J. with a sturdy willfulness that leaves us confident she can take perfectly good care of herself. And then there's the wonderful Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman, who imbues the character with a sense of honestly and freshness that is impossible not to like. Spiderman 2 is one of the best actions films of the year so far, and probably one of the greatest superhero films of all time. Mike Leonard July 04.</p></body></html>

I think that this classic will be treasured always and to me it has enough scares in it!!!!!! When dead people won't stay dead its up to this group of survivors to stay away from the dead or else they become one of them!!!!!! Like i said before Night of the Living Dead has been out for years and when they remade this one it was not as good as this one here and if you love horror movies then go out and pick up this true horror classic for you dvd collection!!!!!!</p></body></html>

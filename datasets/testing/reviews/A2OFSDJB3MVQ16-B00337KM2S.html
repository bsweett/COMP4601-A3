<meta name="summary" content="Reitman and Clooney combine to make this one of the best of 2009"></head><body><p>Although I was cool to director Jason Reitman's first two films, "Thank You for Smoking" and "Juno", this dramedy signaled his maturity in the ranks of the top directors of today like Scorsese, Katherine Bigelow(The Hurt Locker)or James Cameron (Titanic, Avatar). For one starters, it has a smart well written script and a top notch performance by George Clooney which will certainly earn him and Reitman Oscar nods. Plus the supporting characters are also well drawn out and performed to perfection by Anne Kendricks, Vera Farmiga, J.K. Simmons and Danny McBride. I won't go to much into the plot except to say it is about the rude awakening of a man who's been "up in the air" far too long to recognize his own humanity.  If you love great dialogue and acting, do check this out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, lousy, cheap, terrible BluRay version"></head><body><p>The movie, well, it's still great. This commentary is strictly on the BluRay version.<br /><br />Extras: Minimal<br /><br />Video Quality: Terrible. It looks like an old, damaged, partially burned film was used as the master. There are scratches, black marks - even jitters. More like a drive-in movie that was played 100 times too many. All that was redone was some of the text. The classic scene when Arnold stands up - in the left portion of the screen is this dancing black burn/scrape the size of a large rat moving up and down the screen.  When Kyle lands in the alley, it looks like there are coffee grounds on the lens.  It's that bad - seriously.  The only part (and I do mean part) that anyone took time on was Arnold's front nude scene when he walked towards the punks, seeking clothing. You clearly see said "part" dangling and bobbing. Nuf' said.<br /><br />The opening menu reminded me of some cheesy fan website. The button audio was 10x louder than the background audio. Each time I arrowed up or down, I thought I'd blow a speaker. Even the rendering was poor - too few frames, so it's jittery.  I picture someone at the studio yelling "Hey, I need an intern to learn BluRay mastering - here's some software, a video camera, some film and the keys to the screening room. Do me proud."<br /><br />DVD quality: Well, the menu froze several times for around two seconds. The opening titles froze for a second.  The movie froze several times for a second or two.  I have a new, version 2 BluRay player and around 20 BluRay movies. This is the ONLY one this has happened on. This is a minimal quality, no frills (not even a one page insert), low-budget production.  To be honest, I think my DVD version is better (except for the audio.)<br /><br />Audio: Phenomenal. True 5.1 - the rumbles shake the rafters, gunfire and plasma rifle lovers can rejoice.  Arnold's stoic accent thunders.<br /><br />Skip it.</p></body></html>

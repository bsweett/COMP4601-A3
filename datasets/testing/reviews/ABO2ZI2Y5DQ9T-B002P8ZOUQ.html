<meta name="summary" content="Such a Waste of Potential"></head><body><p>While watching "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," I couldn't help feeling something is missing here, in this special effect-laden "prequel" to the "X-Men" franchise. It has a lot of actions, but though they are entertaining enough, none of them is really imaginative and some effects look a bit cheesy. It has a lot of characters (including young Cyclops), but none of them are really interesting with no plot or character development. But perhaps what "Wolverine" doesn't have is the soul - soul of the characters including Wolverine himself.<br /><br />What you have instead is typical cardboard characters and uninvolving romance / revenge story. The new film tells the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), his half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) and Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy military organization. Sadly, the conflict or complexity within the characters that made the two Bryan Singer-directed "X-Men" films something special is totally gone. Victor and Stryker are both stereotyped (psychopathic villain and military villain) and Wolverine is the hero bent on revenge. Such a waste of potential.<br /><br />But of course, it might be that the new film wants to be something different, something with lots of actions and visuals. The filmmakers (including Hugh Jackman himself as co-producer) are entitled to that. However, I don't think Gavin Hood (best known for his Oscar-winning "Tsotsi") is the best choice for that job. With poorly-edited actions and not-so-impressive effects, the thrills and suspense is half gone especially when most characters are too stupid to know the obvious results of their choice.<br /><br />What "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" really needs is a good story with more complicated characters like Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier. And veterans like Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart (the latter seen very briefly) whose acting bring the characters to life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It was Laura, But She's Only a Dream..."></head><body><p>What a super movie! A gorgeous young woman is killed and the detective assigned to the case (Dana Andrews) becomes obsessed with her portrait. Suspects include her fiance (Vincent Price), his sugar-mama (Judith Anderson), and a sarcastic radio star (Clifton Webb) who loved her.  The actors are all elegant, graceful, and beautiful, especially Gene Tierney as Laura. The theme music is, of course, very important to the movie. It's all handled with great style. You'll love it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Timeless crime masterpiece about respect, intimacy, and rules"></head><body><p>I am completely ashamed to admit as an amateur film buff that I just watched "Heat" for the first time, 21 years after it appeared in theaters. I've caught bits and pieces on cable over the years, but have never seen the entire movie until now.  Wow, what a timeless masterpiece!  The criminal element and the investigative process converge in perfect movie harmony in the film on such an intimate level that the last moment is a genuine, flawless finale.<br /><br />The surprising aspect to the film was the intimacy revealed in all the characters, their relationships, and the consequences that occur when you violate your own rules.  There were at least six relationships interwoven into the heart of the movie adding power far beyond the criminal plot, but each essential to the story.  The resolutions of the relationships within the plot resulted in the film lasting three hours, but nothing could have been excluded.<br /><br />The acting was incredible.  The direction and cinematography perfect. If you have not watched "Heat," do so.<br /><br />Now, there are a lot of choices you can make to add "Heat" to your library. I purchased an inexpensive DVD Quad-Pack here on Amazon that included "Heat," The Devil's Advocate," "Insomnia," and "Seven."  The DVD transfer was exceptional on all the movies, a rare find in a Quad-Pack.</p></body></html>

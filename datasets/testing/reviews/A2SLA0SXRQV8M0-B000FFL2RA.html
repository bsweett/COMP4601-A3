<meta name="summary" content="Self-Hate Guilt Trip"></head><body><p>A self hate guilt trip, this movie deals with the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. I have no problems with the Crusades being told from the Muslim point of view; the problem with this movie is that the Christians are shown as oozing self hate, doubting their mission in the Levant, when in reality, even this late in the Crusades, they deeply believe in the righteousness of their cause (the movie is otherwise relatively accurate in historic terms). Add to that that the action scenes are very poor, that the acting is uniformly bad (Jeremy Irons is particularly terrible, but you can't forget the awfulness of that new invention of the star system, Orlando Bloom, a stand-in for Argentine footballer Ariel Ortega) and you have a very disappointing movie.</p></body></html>

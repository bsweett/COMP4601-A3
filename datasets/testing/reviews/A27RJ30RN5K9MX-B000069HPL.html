<meta name="summary" content="The funniest movies I have seen in years"></head><body><p>Peter Gibbons ( Ron Livingston)is fed up with his life and wants to make a change. He decides to try hypnotism, to put him in a better mood. However, the hypnotist suffers a heart attack and dies right before he can snap Peter out of the trance. Now Peter doesn't have a care in the world, and is determined to get fired from his boring cubicle existence at Initech Corporation. Armed with a leisurely new attitude, and a sexy new girlfriend (Jennifer Anniston), he goes out of his way to neglect his job. However, this is where the story gets interesting, because it quickly gets Peter promoted into upper management. His two friends Samir Nayeenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman) always play by the rules. Unfortunately, they are fired due to cutbacks. So to get even, Peter and his two friends devise a plan to rip off the company. <p>This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Everyone can relate to the story, because at one time or another, you have hated your job and wanted to do something about it. The characters in this movie, actually get to live out that fantasy. The acting is great all around. Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter. Everything he does to upset his bosses and neglect his job is outstanding. David Herman and Ajay Naidu are extremely good as well. However Gary Cole gives the film's best performance as Bill Lumberg. "Uh Yeahh Peter...What's Happening." He goes out of his way to make the employees miserable, from having them work on the weekend, to stealing poor Milton's stapeler, and moving him into the basement. Jennifer Aniston does a nice job as well. Watching her fight with her boss over the pieces of "flair" is priceless. The two Bob's played by John C. McGinley and Paul Wilson are hilarious! Last but not least is Stephen Root as Milton. His obsessions with his stapeler and his overall personality will make you laugh and feel sorry for the guy. <p>"Office Space" is a comedic masterpiece. We can all relate to the story, the laughs are non-stop, and all of the actors are fantastic. My only question is - Why couldn't FOX put out a better DVD? With how funny the movie was, you know there had to be tons of outtakes, and plenty of deleted scenes. So where are they? There are absolutely no special features whatsoever. To make things even worse, the presentation of the film itself was barely above average. This may be the one time that you should go with the VHS version of the film.</p></body></html>

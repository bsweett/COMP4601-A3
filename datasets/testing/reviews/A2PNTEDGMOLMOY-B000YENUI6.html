<meta name="summary" content="Viggo Mortensen disappears into y et another fantastic role as a Russian gangster"></head><body><p>London over the recent years has become sort of a Casablanca of the world of  high finance, home to anyone and everyone with a billion or two.  Once you're dealing with that kind of wealth, very few people ask serious questions about where the money comes from.  To say that there are some seriously wealthy Russians with murky pasts currently residing along the Thames is like saying there are a few computer geeks in Silicon Valley.<br /><br />And so it is that David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen reunite after 2005's "A History of Violence" for another sterling film focusing on the darker side of human nature.  The movie opens with an assassination (throat slit in a barber's chair) and a death of an innocent girl (giving birth to a her daughter).  The girl is a Russian, Tatiana, and the London midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts), who helped deliver her daughter takes it upon herself to find the orphan's family.<br /><br />Her only clue is Tatiana's diary, and it leads her to a Russian restaurant, owned by the suave, unsettling Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stall).  Semyon shows a disturbing interest in the diary and offers to help Anna translate it.  And so Anna finds herself slowly brought into Semyon's criminal world, for the restaurant is a mere front for Semyon's other, more lucrative businesses.<br /><br />Semyon has his own issues.  His son, Kirill (Vincent Cassell) is a drunken wastrel, and does not compare favorably to the hired help, Nikolai (Mortensen).  Nikolai is allegedly the chauffeur for Kirill, but he's clearly the guy who gets things done and cleans up after Kirill's mistakes, as Nikolai proves when he calmly disposes of the evidence of a murder.<br /><br />This is a movie of atmosphere and tension, where tattoos can say more than the longest speeches.  Mortensen practically disappears into Nikolai, but that shouldn't be a surprise for anyone who has watched him act before.  Nikolai has some charm and some compassion, but it is wrapped up in so many layers of ruthlessness and fatalism that it only occasionally gets a chance to rear its ugly head.  Mortensen is so perfect for this part that it's hard to appreciate how perfectly he was cast in "The Lord of the Rings" and "Hidalgo."<br /><br />Cronenberg deftly weaves a complex web of deceit, betrayal, and devotion - this is not a movie you should watch with one of those friends who prefers to yak yak yak and expect you to "tell me what's happening."  The entire plot can turn on a quick aside or terse conversation, but the movie rewards the diligent viewer.<br /><br />This is also an extremely violent movie, culminating in one of the best fight scenes in any movie when Nikolai fights off two Chechen mobsters out for revenge, armed and clad with nothing other than his tattoos.<br /><br />Mortensen deserves an Academy Award, and it's possible that if he wins one in the next couple of years, the award will be payback for passing him over for this performance.  Wow.</p></body></html>

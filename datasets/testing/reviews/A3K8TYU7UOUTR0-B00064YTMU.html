<meta name="summary" content="Mr. Mann, please come back to us!"></head><body><p>Hollywood is about Fantasy. If you want "reality" go shopping at Publix. Yet, the real secret to a great film is that something essential about it must be anchored to an aspect of reality. In terms of supplying "reality" the filmaker has to toss the viewer a bone, after which the viewer eagerly fills in the gaps. Well, Michael Mann tosses us no such bones here. The very essential premise; i.e. a high-tech, highly paid hit man decides to kill a series of eye-witnesses by enlisted the aid of a cabbie, is so fundamentally stupid the remainder of the film spins away into nothing.<br /><br />It really isn't necessary to enumerate the problems with this concept. Anyone that has ever flagged down a taxi, anytime or anywhere in the world, can immediately see the long list of obviouis problems.<br /><br />Secondly, all the key witnesses to this hugely important trial are simply available for the killing. Not a one of them is under police protection. Christ, who needs an overpaid hitman for this job?<br /><br />All in all, a very sad outing for Michael Mann, who normally delivers a tremendous film. Is this really the director that brought us that crime masterpiece, "Heat"? --Mykal Banta</p></body></html>

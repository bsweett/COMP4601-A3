The key words are 'Motion Picture' - whilst the subsequent 'Star Trek' were often better, this was the only attempt to make  a truly 'cinematic' 'Star Trek' film.<p>The story behind the making is  probably more interesting than the film itself. In brief, it grew from an  aborted 'Star Trek: Phase Two' television series, and was produced with a  large budget by Paramount's motion picture division. A troubled production,  marred by an aborted initial set of special effects, led to a production  that was delivered at the last minute, and over budget to the tune of 30  million dollars - a lot in those days, and twice the expected cost. Coupled  with a bad critical reception, it almost killed off the franchise, despite  eventually turning a profit.<p>The good things - Douglas Trumbull's effects  are striking, dark and mysterious, much closer to 'Alien' than subsequent  'Star Trek' films, and space seems a much more dangerous place. Jerry  Goldsmith's music is the exact opposite of his 'Planet of the Apes' work -  lush and melodious, it has to do an awful lot, as Robert Wise's direction  is often very slow and ponderous. There's a memorable, loud 'twannng' noise  in there that became a cliche in subsequent sci-fi films. Furthermore, the  opening sequence, as Klingon battleships are knocked out of the sky by a  malevolent force, is fantastic.<p>On the other hand, the plot is very thin  for the two-hour running-time (Kirk and Co. inspect new Enterprise - Kirk  and Co. fly towards giant energy cloud - Kirk and Co. deal with giant  energy cloud - end), the costume designs have dated horribly (if they were  not dated already), and the film spends so long pondering supposedly deep  questions of life, the universe and everything that the people seem to get  lost.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Superb Film About An Outstanding & Candid General"></head><body><p>General George S. Patton Jr. (1885-1945) was one of America's most outstanding generals and strategists during World War II, but his tendency to speak very candidly and crassly often got him into trouble with the public and higher ranking officers.  Labeled by newspapers as "Blood & Guts", Patton demanded discipline from every soldier under his command.  He loved to study about ancient battles and saw himself as one of many reincarnations of various warriors who had fought battles throughout 2000 years.  He loved war and knew nothing else.  Beginning in 1942, General Patton commanded forces in North Africa fighting against the occupying German forces under the command of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.  Following victory in North Africa, he commanded the Seventh Army during the joint invasion of Sicily.  British forces that also invaded Sicily were under the command of the revered Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery.  Following the allied invasion of France in 1944, General Patton was given command of the Third Army and swept across France at record pace.  His juggernaut was also successful in relieving the beleaguered American troops trapped in the city of Bastogne, France.  He was also one of the first American commanders to discover the horrors of Nazi concentration camps.  Considered by many to be a prima donna, he had no tolerance for any soldier suffering from "shell shock" or "battle fatigue"; instead he labeled such as a coward.  He wrote a book entitled "War As I Knew It" that was first published in 1947, two years after his death from a car accident.<p>Based upon the two books "Patton: Ordeal and Triumph" by Ladislas Farago and "A Soldier's Story" by General Oman N. Bradley, director Franklin J. Schaffner created the film "Patton" in 1970 starring George C. Scott as the outspoken General Patton, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  (Scott refused to accept the Oscar on the grounds that he did not consider himself to be in competition with other actors.)  The film begins with Patton standing before a giant American flag and giving a speech to troops that have been placed under his command.  Following the speech, the film documents Patton's life between 1942 (when he begins fighting Germans in North Africa) and 1945 (shortly after the defeat of Germany).  <p>Aspects of the film that well depict General Patton were the competition that he felt with Field Marshall Montgomery (Michael Bates) and personality conflicts with General Bradley (Karl Malden). Of course, since the actual General Bradley consulted directly on the film, the portrayal of Patton could be regarded as being slightly biased.  Also depicted were Patton's slapping of a frightened soldier (Tim Considine) whom he also accused of being a coward, as well as candid comments made in Knutsford, England, that made Patton a public relations liability for the Allied Command.  Sadly, not shown in the film was the liberation of the concentration camp at Buchenwald by the Third Army.  There, General Patton was the first American commander to order nearby German civilians to tour a liberated concentrated camp: a precedent adopted by other American field commanders.<p>Franklin J. Schaffner received the Oscar for Best Director for "Patton" and the film also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound and Best Writing.  It also received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Visual Effects.  At 170 minutes, the film does not seem too long.  Instead, the various battles were done very well and George C. Scott's excellent portrayal of General Patton is completely engaging.  Overall, I rank "Patton" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend the film to everyone.  General Patton was instrumental in the Allies' decisive victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.</p></body></html>

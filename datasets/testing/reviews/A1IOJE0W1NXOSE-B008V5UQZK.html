They are so entrenched in their own ethnicity that imitations of Greek statues adorn their lawn and Toula's father can prove that every word in the English language originally comes from Greek.  Nia persuades her parents to let her attend college and she has a physical transformation which leads to a romance with an engaging Anglo teacher, played by John Corbett.  There is a predictable clash of cultures when the two young lovers meet one another's families and the working out of these problems is the meat of the film.  Toula vacillates between love and embarrassment for her large family who talk too loud, eat too much, and get into each other's business.  If you need a good laugh and a "feel-good" movie, this one's for you!</p></body></html>

It's sappy, but it works, not least because it's been an entertaining ride getting there with two sympathetic and scrappy lovers.  The closest ancestor of Across the Universe is Moulin Rouge, a movie I found just annoying.  Not so with Universe -- most of the Beatles songs are performed adequately or more, and some, e.g. Dear Prudence, Revolution, and She Came in through the Bathroom Window, mesh nicely with the loose plot.  It's not the least about the Beatles, but is loosely about the 60's as seen through some of the Beatles' songs.  Call it the 60's that nobody and everybody lived.  Many of the sequences are drenched in color, and a few are over-choreographed, to simulate -- perhaps -- the distortion of color and time when high. But most of Across the Universe is a rush, and the dancing, when not over long, is high energy and imaginative. In the end, the movie may be like the 60's themselves, a great run, a little silly, and not quite as world turning as some of the participants may have wished or believed.</p></body></html>

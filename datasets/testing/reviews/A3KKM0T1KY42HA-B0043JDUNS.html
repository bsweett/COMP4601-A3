<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man Lives Again"></head><body><p>What makes the Iron Man movies great is that it all looks so real and Director Jon Favreau does an excellent job making it all believable too. And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an "iron" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but can fly.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of the eccentric, wise-guy Tony Stark than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark in Iron Man 1 and he hits it on the head again in 2! The rest of the cast, including Mickey Rourke, and acting in the movie were terrific. Rourke has about 3 lines in the movie, but that's all he needed. His character was well played and effective. And kudos to Sam Rockwell for an equally effective Justin Hammer portrayal.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 picks up where 1 left off and has Rourke as Ivan Vanko out to avenge is father for a slight by Stark Industries. And Justin Hammer is just the man to help Ivan exact his revenge. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing once again has the viewer clamoring more Jon Favreau's in Marvel's series of Avengers related films over the next several years...I can't wait.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 lost a little of the original shine that 1 had, but it's still an excellent movie. Worthy of collection and at minimum a Netflix must.</p></body></html>

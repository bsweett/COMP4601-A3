<meta name="summary" content="Very Artistic, Visual &amp; Really Moves!"></head><body><p>I've frequently found German cinema to be too depressing for my own taste as has my husband.  However, this film got rave reviews on my film listserv so I had to give it a chance.  I was drawing when I put it on the video  player and, five minutes into the film, I had put away my drawing, not to  touch it again until the movie was over!  That is how much this movie  grabbed my eye.  The director has quite the artist's eye and takes us  through 3 different visual versions of reality for Lola as she runs to try  to save her boyfriend's life.  We see how very small increments of time can  make vital changes to the opportunities and chances one has in life,  including whether one will even continue living!  There is not a second  wasted in the telling of this story and it is told very visually instead of  being laden with dialogue.  Lola has some very dramatic encounters with her  father, a banking executive, in these 3 versions of her running. At the  end, you feel very aware of how close you might live to momentary disaster,  especially in light of the effects of Lola's runs to the pedestrians and  drivers on the streets where she runs.  We found ourselves very caught up  in the film and wanted our own copy of it as soon as it was over, which we  did get.</p></body></html>

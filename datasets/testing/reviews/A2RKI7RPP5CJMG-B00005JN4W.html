<meta name="summary" content="Something For Everyone"></head><body><p>All of Pixar's films have been very good in my opinion, but each one seemed to either lean a little to the youngsters(Finding Nemo, Toy Story) or to the older folks(Monsters, Inc.)  "The Incredibles" manages to dance the line between all demographics and comes across as the perfect mixture of young and old wrapped into one.  It has slapstick, silly humor for the very young, it has adventure and suspense that will knock the socks off of older children and young teens, and it has a brilliant storyline that pulls in the older audience.<br /><br />We've all wanted to be great at sometime in our lives.  Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl, are given that chance.  But thanks to a few snakey lawyers and their lawsuits, our heroes are driven into a sort of witness protection program for superheroes.  Unable to deny his need to protect the innocent, Mr. Incredible, along with fellow ex-superhero, Frozone, secretly helps out those who are in need of a hero.  Of course, this all leads to a trap that is set by Mr. Incredible's arch-nemesis, Syndrome.  What follows is a family adventure that encompasses all age groups.<br /><br />My daughter, who is three, was scared a little when the Incredible children are chased by a few mechanical monstrosities.  What amazes me is that she loves to watch the ogres in the "Lord of the Rings" films and they don't phase her one bit.  All I can come up with is that she is scared because other children are in harm's way.  Anyway, there is no foul language or themes that will drive away viewers.  Everything is fairly safe, but it holds your attention the entire time.  Folks with meek or quiet children who scare easily may want to preview this one before letting the really young'uns watch this, but I don't think there is too much contained herein to offend.<br /><br />Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee master the attitude, style, and charisma of their respective characters.  It's amazing how Pixar can manage to take actors and actresses whose stars aren't quite as bright as many others and crank out a great movie.  They have restored my faith in REAL actors.<br /><br />The action is fast-paced and fun to watch.  If you like the action in "Spider-Man" or "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," you will not be upset.  The whole film has that "comic-come-to-life" feel about it.  There is suspense, drama, and some sweet moments as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I'd give it five stars, but the only detraction I have is that the movie does run quite long.  That's not a good thing if your three year-old is the type who can only handle about an one-and-a-half hours of "sitting quiet" time.  If you don't have kids, consider this a five star flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Close Encounters of the Third Kind."></head><body><p>This movie is a bit overhyped, I am not going to argue the movie has good acting and special effects,and that perhaps we may not be alone. I really like the scene on the highway near the train tracks and The chase,*SPOILER*but really "Roy" is such a jerk and leaves to join the mothership? I would hope they torture him up there for being such a bad father and husband. probe him good. I also dislike spielberg for commenting "If we can communicate with beings from another planet peacefully then why not The Reds during the Cold War?" something to that effect. Spielberg must be one helluva naive person to state something like that and believe it. I also believe that Aliens wouldn't come here, Humans are too dumb,why bother. And if they did come they would probably destroy us.<br />I would never want to have an encounter, The movie itself is not bad,but you go back to one place(India) then another (Muncie,Indiana) why not focus on One place and one plot? I prefer Signs to this. And the end of this movie totally killed it for me.See for yourself whether you agree or disagree with my review.it's not a bad movie  but certainly could have been better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Imortalization of a Classic"></head><body><p>At first I was really skeptical at the idea of a 1080p version of a film made more than a half-century ago.  Blu-Ray renditions of classic films such as Top Gun and Ghostbusters leave considerably more to be desired since most movie watchers could care less about the plethora of special features per disc.  This begs the question of "why should we watch classics on Blu-Ray beyond two dozen different commentaries that couldn't be fit on a single DVD disc?  As such, I was curious to see how Sony would remaster the classic with Blue-Ray capabilities.<br /><br />After watching Snow White on Blu-Ray, my skepticism still remains albeit the film did, to a certain extent, exceed expectation.<br /><br />The film is, indeed, completely remastered in a fashion akin to how George Lucas re-rendered/restored numerous scenes in the original Star Wars trilogy (albeit w/o additional scenes).  The animation is considerably improved upon as the flow seems to be more fluid if not seamless.  It bears a certain resemblance to cell shading although that would be a reasonable stretch.<br /><br />Pertaining to the special features, I'll be bluntly honest here.  I could care less about the silly flash-esque games, the documentaries, storyboards, family game night features, sing-a-long, crap.  I'm sure some kids and film afficianados will appreciate said features, but to the majority of us movie watchers forking over the capitol to invest in a Blu-Ray player we typically have one thing on our mind; high definition viewing.  As such, I really cannot speculate on the alleged awesomeness that is the special features on the disc since I would rather throw in Uncharted 2 into my PS3 and play that instead.<br /><br />However, the digital re-rending/restoring of Snow White was impressive enough to justify obtaining the Blu-Ray copy over a regular DVD disc of the film.  Well done Disney!  Now bring out Beauty and the Beast and Lion King in Blu-Ray before I go buy Mass Effect 2 on my 360!  :P</p></body></html>

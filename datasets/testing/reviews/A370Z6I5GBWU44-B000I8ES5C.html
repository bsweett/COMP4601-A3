There's great kung fu scenes in here and funny dialogue, and a great cast of characters with some cool lines and actions. I have to say that my favorite character in the entire movie is the landlady.<br /><br />I only have one quibble - I would have loved to see the cute deaf girl deliver some kung-fu action at the ending, since I felt that her forgiveness was too easy. It would have been cool to see her deliver some cool moves and kick him around before she took his hand. The 'Palm of Buddha' was an awesome move, and if it were real, wow! Overall a great and funny movie with the right mix of comedy and action.</p></body></html>

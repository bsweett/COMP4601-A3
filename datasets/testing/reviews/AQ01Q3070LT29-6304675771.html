David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are together again for the Audio Commentary of this Collector's Edition of the now-classic An American Werewolf in London (1981).  They laugh together as they share their memories about filming the movie and share some interesting tidbits for you.  Bonus materials: An original five-minute featurette on the Making of An American Werewolf in London (Behind-the scenes).  A new 18-minute interview with John Landis.  An 11-minute interview with Academy Award winner Make-up Artist, Rick Baker. Also a very interesting featurette with David Naughton and the make-up crew on the casting and molding of David's hand and arm.  The Outtakes are for ADULTS ONLY to see and hear.  One outtake is pornographic.  Absolutly the best werewolf film ever made.  It's scary and made as a comdy too.  It gave me the chills in the movie theatre.  Goosebumps all over my arms.  David Naughton (Dr. Pepper commercials, "Makin' It" tv-series and song) is perfect in the lead role.  Griffin Dunne plays David's friend.  Jenny Agutter (Logan's Run [1976]) plays David's nurse and soon to be his lover.  Lila Kaye plays the barmaid.  The special effects in this film were new at the time.  No computer imaging in this one because it had not been invented yet.<br />  Not for children to see.  Film includes male frontal nudity, female nudity, pornographic scenes and audio, and very bloody and gory violence.<br /><br /> ***Update: A new Hi-Def and Blu-Ray DVD version,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304675771">An American Werewolf in London</a> will be released September 25, 2009. Lots of Special features included.<br /><br /> Make-up artist Rick Baker has also worked on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO0W">The Wolfman</a> (2010) starring Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Movie You Won't Forget"></head><body><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is another fabulous movie from writer Charlie Kaufman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007AJF8">Being John Malkovich</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation (Superbit Collection)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000714E6">Human Nature</a>).  Joel Barish wants to forget his former girlfriend so he goes to a company and gets his memory erased.<br /><br />This movie is wonderful and really makes you think.  I recommend that everybody should see this movie.<br /><br />The DVD, which is an upgrade from the single disc features a few more things.  Not only do you get the same features from the first disc (which very well may be that first disc) you get a second disc full of other features.<br /><br />There's a second interview with Kate Winslet and Michel Gondry (the first contained Jim Carrey and the director).  A feature for Michel Gondry himself and more deleted scenes from the movie.  There's even a commemorative photo book.<br /><br />This DVD is highly recommended.  The movie's one of the best of the year.</p></body></html>

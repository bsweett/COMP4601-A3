She was also nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance in this sequel.  Beeban Kidron whose Hollywood directorial debut was for "Used People" in 1992 and also had a moderate hit with "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar," takes the slapstick and pratfalls to the next level in her work on this film.  The pacing on the film is brisk and keeps us riveted to the fine actors' performances.  Zellweger has gone from success to success with her Oscar nominated performance in "Chicago" and her Best Supporting Oscar win for "Cold Mountain."  She puts on a few pounds and makes Bridget seem like a real woman caught up in the strangeness of her life.  The sequence in Thailand where she lands in a jail and teaches all the Thai inmates to sing is hilarious.  What really works about the film is the romance.  As Mark Darcy, Colin Firth has a magnetism that he's been able to show repeatedly on film ("A Month in the Country," "Valmont," "Circle of Friends," "The English Patient," "Shakespeare In Love," "Girl with a Pearl Earring").  As the somewhat stiff barrister, he shows great heart while still maintaining that British reserve.  The fight sequence in the pond with Hugh Grant is hilarious.  The DVD extras where Grant & Firth repeatedly put each other down like, "He's gaining some weight," or "He's showing his age," is good-natured fun.  Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is again one of Britain's best comic actors with great timing and charming good looks.  While Cleaver is as sleazy as ever, he's also hilariously sleazy, and the audience feels that the character just can't help himself.  All in all, while a bit more slapstick than the first film, this sequel puts a smile on your face and is a satisfying good time.  Was it good for you?  :)  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's about time..."></head><body><p>After a decade the story is finally on the big screen.  After years of novels and comic books we get to see Predators and Aliens go at it on the big screen.  For those of you only use to the Alien and Predator films there is one thing I should point out.  I could point out more, but I don't wish to spoil it.<br /><br />For those Predator fans who might get upset because it seems the hunters have tossed out the rules, the rituals of the hunt, please remember that different prey is hunted in different ways.  And even Predators toss out the rules when things go wrong.<br /><br />As for the Aliens they still scare the sh*t out of me (like they did in their first two movies).  Shiny, wet, evil creatures!  Yuckie-pooh!  They even surprised me in their first encounter with the Predators and gave the movie a cool ending!<br /><br />Oh, and I guess the humans did OK also.<br /><br />Just sit down, eat the popcorn, enjoy the film and don't worry about the shadows moving about in the dark theater.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Fun; Excellent Action; Two Disc  set review"></head><body><p>The story in this film is very ornate, and its not as gratuitous as some might want you to believe.Blade and Co are summoned to help the regular Vampires fight off a "Common Enemy", which is part of a story that has many twists and turns.<br />Overall, its indeed very cool, is a notch up from the first BLADE, but has the "Del Toro" factor; that is, Del Toro seems to know he is ramping up a Franchise, but he also adds his own little twists and, in a word, perversions. Possibly the key addition to this world, is Del Toro's attempt to remove the sub-text of why Vampires do what they do, and to change the "Anne Rice" factor.<br />The DVD  extras are superbly plentiful in this  set. Two Sets of commentaries on disc one ( go for the Wesley Snipes and David  Goyer commentary first, in my view, since that is the most entertaining, and Del Toro's and Frankfurt's commentary is basically a lot of stuff that might be something you need to know as a fan, but not as a movie fan, maybe as a movie maker, and certainly shows that an excess of perversion never stopped amnyone from making good films).<br />Disc two has two main sections. There is no doubt that Del Toro is creative, however his little obsessions are a tad too much when viewed and heard in this context. The Making of Section is probably the best item to view first. And in the out-takes and deleted  scenes, the commentary is sometimes useful, but is often just plain off the yuck scale. So, its good to see the deletes and out-takes, which are, I think ( my opinion) mostly done correctly, some deletes are just on the level of "Why?", and the out-takes are fun.<br />All in all a pretty excellent Value Package. Done before Del Toro did  HELLBOY, it is very illustrative of his creative skill and indulgence in some weird obsessions.</p></body></html>

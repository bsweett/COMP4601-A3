<meta name="summary" content="A Great Story Ruined By War Porn and Medical Experiment Gore"></head><body><p>I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares!<br /><br />A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that?<br /><br />If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)<br /><br />The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.<br /><br />THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!<br /><br />Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!<br /><br />See:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1475075049">Save Me the Aisle Seat: The Good, the Bad and the Really Bad Movies: Selected Reviews by an Online Film Reviewer</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456312812">What's A Nice Actor Like You Doing In A Movie Like This?: The ultimate guide to the most embarrassing movies in history, and the celebrities who appeared in them.</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1446522814">War, Sadism and Pacifism - Further Essays on Group Psychology and War</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076791547X">Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present</a></p></body></html>

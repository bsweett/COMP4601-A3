<meta name="summary" content="Clark Kent returns"></head><body><p>That doesn't make for a great movie title perhaps. But, the truth of the situation is that (despite what the intro to the George Reeves TV show said) "Superman" is the disguise, and it is Clark Kent who Kal-El really is...adopting a disguise that he wears when he conducts his super-feats, to protect his own identity and privacy, and to protect his family.<br /><br />I enjoyed Superman Returns a great deal, but it didn't ring perfectly for me in just this one area. While Clark returns from his 5-year voyage, to his parents' farm first, and spends time with his Mom, and then goes back to Metropolis and gets his reporting job back at the Daily Planet, he doesn't actually do any investigative reporting, as he is well known to do. On the other hand, perhaps he's just out of it, from his long trip, just a little. It's a small thing, this detail, in a story that otherwise worked quite well for me. It's clear from Clark's actions that it is as Clark, rather than Superman, that he wants to interact with Lois.<br /><br />Our story opens with Clark returning from a 5-year trip, to Krypton and back. He describes Krypton as a "graveyard" to his mother upon his return. After his short stay with his mother, he heads back to Metropolis, where he gets his old job back, and slowly falls back into his interrupted old life...but with the twists that a five year gap can bring: the love of his life has a child, a fiance, and has moved on.<br /><br />In the meantime, Lex Luthor has also been toiling away. He has a plan (you'll recognize an old theme in this plan of his), and he needs--and steals--Kryptonian technology to execute it. When he hears that his old nemesis has returned, he adapts his plan so as to exact his revenge. Lex's grudge against Superman has strains of truth to it, as he compares Superman to the Greek Titans, and himself to Prometheus...it bears some thinking about.<br /><br />I can't say much more, without spoiling the movie for you. So, let me close with a few other comments. The movie sounds great, re-using the old, familiar themes. The acting...well, it's all reasonably solid, and no one should ever be expecting Oscar performances in these types of movies. The attention paid to the Superman mythos was great to see, from the small touches like the photograph in the Kent home, to the familiar look of the opening credits. And the memoriam in the closing credits was nice to see.<br /><br />It's summertime! Beat the heat, get into the theatre, and enjoy the movie!</p></body></html>

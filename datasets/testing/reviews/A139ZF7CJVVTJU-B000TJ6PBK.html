His record speaks for itself.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451188462">Sometimes</a> he can be brilliant.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169514">Other</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0453007449">times</a> (and this is more often the case), he starts off with a captivating idea, but never seems able to wrap things up with equal captivation.  And then there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525941908">the moments</a> where he's way off the map in all directions.  It's no biggy, considering how prolific his career has been.<br /><br />"1408" was a short story of his that was meant to be more of a creative exercise than anything else.  I've never thought King was much of a short story writer -- his imagination needs room to stretch; "1408" the story isn't so bad, but I remember wondering how on earth they planned to stretch it out to movie-length.  The writer in King's tale isn't in the deadly room for ten minutes before the story comes to a close.<br /><br />It's hard to tell how long Cusak's Mike Enslin ends up in the room.  An hour at least.  The hotel room's powers make it hard to trust one's perceptions.  In fact, the whole of its horror is all about twisted perceptions, and therein lies the flaws of "1408."<br /><br />Enslin is a hack writer (once talented and profound) who makes a living by exploiting areas that are supposedly haunted.  Due to a personal tragedy, Enslin is dead-set against belief in any kind of spirit world, making him both a hack and a hypocrite.  It isn't long after he's shut the door of "1408" behind him that his beliefs are tested by the room's weird, ambient horror.<br /><br />Well, it's not exactly horrific.  King comes up with scary images, but without any supporting substance, they're really nothing more than images.  Bleeding walls.  Paintings with changing pictures.  Menacing spirits that appear and disappear.  Sure, it's creepy, but what's there to it?  As far as "1408" is concerned, there's only one goal: to drive Mr. Enslin mad enough to end his own life.<br /><br />Cusak bears the lion's share of what makes the movie worth watching at all (Samuel Jackson is the other name of note, but all he does as far as this film is concerned is chew on both cigars and scenery).  Enslin's history with his wife and daughter, added for the film, make his experiences noteworthy, although not terribly frightening.  You want him to get out of the hotel, but the room's machinations are just a series of mental tricks.  Psychological horror is what it wants to be; random oddities is what it turns into.<br /><br />King's stories, as far as their successes and failures go, are less about execution and mostly about the concepts that drive them.  "1408" struggles with both.  Cusak keeps things fresh and interesting, but I can't say the same for the hotel room in which he struggles to survive.</p></body></html>

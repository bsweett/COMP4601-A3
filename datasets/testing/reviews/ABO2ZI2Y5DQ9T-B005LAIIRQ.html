Without his strong performance "The Grey" would have been an unwatchable mess.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays John Ottway, a man hired by an oil company in Alaska to "protect" the workers from wolves by shooting them. Ottway take a flight with the crew of oil workers, but his plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness. The premise may reminds us of "Alive" (1993), a film based on true events, but "The Grey," directed by Joe Carnahan ("Narc" "The A-Team"), it seems, aims for something different - something more mystical.<br /><br />Thus grey wolves are depicted as very violent creatures with uncanny abilities to spot the humans. I do not disagree with the idea of turning wolves into symbolic presence, but I still don't know whether I should take the film's story seriously or not. While Joe Carnahan's approach to the subject matter of survival tends to emphasize the realism (with the spectacular visual of the freezing snow and wilderness), the story that unfolds here often looks like an action-movie template, with a group of blood-thirsty wolves (special effects included) and cliff jumping.<br /><br />Some viewers would find the film's abrupt ending (including one post-credit scene) unsatisfactory (is there an alternate ending?) Some may find the film's tone too depressing. But what I didn't like about the film is its lack of credible motives on the humans' side. Why do they have to leave the plane, for instance? Neeson's character explains, but never convinces, as his character, if not his performance, lacks the credible voice of Jack London, who would have given some advice to filmmakers.<br /><br />"The Grey" has two good things in it, Liam Neeson's acting and beautiful photography. Two stars for them.</p></body></html>

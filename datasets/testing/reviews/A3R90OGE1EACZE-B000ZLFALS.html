<meta name="summary" content="Best Movie ever"></head><body><p>The premise of the movie is interesting. A Liverpool ship worker named Jude (Jim Sturgess)goes to the United States during the 1960's to find the father he never knew. He meets up with Max (Joe Anderson) at the college Jude's father works at and they become friends. Jude then falls for Max's sister Lucy while Max gets shipped to Vietnam and Lucy joins the cause as well.<br /><br />What makes the movie extraordinary are the Beatles songs that are interwoven into the story and the way that the characters sing them (especially Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson.)<br /><br />A very powerful movie whose music will stick with you long after you see it.</p></body></html>

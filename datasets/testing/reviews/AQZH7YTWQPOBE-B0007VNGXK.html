<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>I loved Guillermo del Toro's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a> and heard he was going to be directing the new Hobbit movie, so I thought I'd check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a>. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. I generally like films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZ9E">X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)</a>, and superficially this movie was like those - the freaky superheros, the deranged villains. Visually, this is a strong movie and I can see del Toro's hand in creating a dark, visually arresting film.<br /><br />However, the plot and the acting were lousy and cliche. Unlike in a film like X-Men, with the subtle and charismatic Magneto, the villains in Hellboy were a clownish Nazi and, I kid you not, Rasputin the Russian monk. Hellboy himself, played by Ron Perlman, was hard to take seriously. He acts too much like he wants to be tough, but comes across as trying too hard.<br /><br />The story involved secret gates to hell which led to things that looked more like aliens than demons. There are also tons of lose threads - is it really likely that all of the hell hounds were located in one place? If the monster at the end was a "god," as Rasputin says, why was it so easy to kill?<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but just couldn't. At least the fish guy was pretty cool.</p></body></html>

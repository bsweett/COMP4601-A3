<meta name="summary" content="A disappointment"></head><body><p>I will try not to title the review with any references to sleep, or lack of it. Nor will I mention things like Al Pacino sleepwalking through his role. But it seems that this film was shot to make you have empathy with the lead character, a cop who has insomnia in a land where the sun never sets. Pacino does a credible job as a cop who really needs a good snooze, but all the pacing did for me was make me want to nap myself, and that's the problem. <p>The disappointment is that I was looking forward to the movie, especially the interaction with the killer. This is not the first movie that Al Pacino plays a cop who verbally confronts the bad guy before the inevitable violent end. He did it in "Heat" with Robert DiNiro, and in that picture there was blazing chemistry. Once again, maybe it's the sleep thing, but I really think the whole insomnia issue prevents any real electricity from happening. <p>I would have liked to have seen the movie redone without the whole lack of sleep thing. It drains the energy from the film. Robin Williams has shown he's a good dramatic actor, and can make a great villain, but let's try it again some time with Pacino in something different.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not One, But TWO Versions Of The Classic Novel, And More, Included In This Epic Collection."></head><body><p>You read it right, folks. Not one, but TWO splendid film versions of General Lew Wallace's timeless story of a Prince Of Judea and his encounters with the Prince Of Peace are included in this epic collection. The first is the one we all know and love...the 1959 version starring Charlton Heston. Winner of 11 Academy Awards (a record which has been tied twice [once, I think, unfairly, in 1997] but hopefully will never be surpassed), William Wyler's epic blockbuster combines spectacle with the human drama of a man fighting for revenge and receiving redemption in the process. Every Oscar the movie won, it most definitely earned. I grew up watching the 1959 movie, and it's one of my favourites. Besides the well-known chariot race scene in Part II, the best scene is the one where Esther sees Miriam and Tirzah as they prepare to go to the Valley Of The Lepers. Just a heart-wrenching scene, and Mr. Rozsa's haunting score for the scene makes it all the more profound. The second version may be less well-known, but it's a classic, and the one that spawned the 1959 remake...the 1925 silent film version, now with restored Technicolor sequences and a score by Carl Davis recorded in 1990. I highly recommend both film versions. Miklos Rozsa's score for the 1959 film is well-done, and rightfully beloved, but the score for the 1925 film (especially Track 8-"The Chariot Race") is equally impressive, and well-done. This 4 disc set also include two documentaries, screen tests, trailers, footage from the 1959 Academy Awards and more. You can't go wrong with "Ben-Hur." One of the greatest novels of all time is now TWO major motion pictures, and for the first time, both of them are available together. My only complaint (which is fairly minor) is that when you click on one of the menus, there's a screenshot of a deleted scene. The scene is not included as a bonus feature, and I'm curious to know why it was cut from the film and if the scene still exists. Rated G.<br /><br />The unauthorized 1907 silent film of "Ben-Hur" is available on YouTube for viewing.</p></body></html>

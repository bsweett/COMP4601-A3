Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is the "white trash" waitress who is desperate to better herself and persuades Dunn to take her on as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  They have both been pretty beaten up by life, but their new-found affiliation brings them fame, fortune, and, most importantly, a surrogate father-daughter relationship that is immensely healing to them both.  Little do they realize, the cruelest blow is yet to come.<br /><br />The story could be criticized as clich&eacute;, but that would be like criticizing the coat-hanger and ignoring the garment it displays.  This is not a plot-driven film.  Director Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis have given us fully developed characters and the cast, including the wonderful Morgan Freeman, have brought them powerfully to life.  The end of this film is just gut-wrenching.  I have never before seen such a genuinely effecting performance from Eastwood, who eschews his usual stoic, clenched jaw persona to deliver an Oscar-worthy performance.  Swank is amazing as well.  This is a great film./</p></body></html>

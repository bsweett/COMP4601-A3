I wisely chose to watch Kung Fu Panda.<br /><br />I was curious as to how Kung Fu Panda would present itself: as a Lion King-style retelling of ancient Chinese myth, or as a love note to kung fu films from an American perspective.  I'm pleased to report that it's the latter.<br /><br />You know the story: Po (a restrained Jack Black) adores the Furious Five but is too fat and slow to ever hope to become one of them and then fate does precisely that. It's the heroes who have the real problem (each representing a different kung fu style and all voiced by a roster of celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu). Struggling most of all is Master Shifu - a bit redundant, if you know the definition of Shifu - played by Dustin Hoffman (wouldja believe?) who is still suffering from the betrayal of his first and best pupil Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />What's surprising about Kung Fu Panda is how adult the story is.  The word "kill" is mentioned several times.  Tai Lung and Shifu have a physical conflict that is much a battle of philosophies as it is a father and son having an argument.  And the plot is beautiful in its symmetry, perfectly tying in every element: from the modified style of kung-food training that Shifu teaches Po to the revelation of Po's (we can only assume adopted) duck-father's secret recipe to the fact that Po is immune to acupuncture (because he's so fat, of course) Kung Fu Panda is tightly scripted and wrapped up in a beautiful package.<br /><br />The movie itself (what I could see on the tiny airplane screen) is beautifully produced.  It ranges from Chinese-style art to realistic but soft-colored tones, to bursts of color amidst pitch darkness.  The fight scenes are all in exciting locations: in a prison, on a rope bridge, in an ancient temple.  It's like a videogame, only you're watching the fat guy character nobody wants to play. It was beautiful enough that I had a pang of regret that I wasn't watching it on a big screen. Or even a medium screen.<br /><br />For kids, Po is a great tale about overcoming obstacles by being yourself.  For geeks, Po is a hilarious new hero archetype: the fanboy as hero, a fat, slobbering devotee who knows more details about the Furious Five than they know about themselves.</p></body></html>

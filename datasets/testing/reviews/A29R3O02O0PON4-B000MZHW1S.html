Conflict diamonds are basically those that are mined in Sierra Leone, but then smuggled into neighboring countries like Liberia (which was lead at the time by Charles Taylor) and then sold on the black market for much more than what the government Sierra Leone would be willing to pay and then sell them for.<br /><br />This lead to a group of rebels (the RUF - Revolutionary United Front) to spring up to oppose the government.  However these rebels were brutal in their diamond mining process.  They'd shoot anybody that didn't provide their share of slave work to mine the diamonds, basically.  This got to the point of slaughtering entire villages and then even the capital city, Freetown.  It wasn't until 2003 when a Treaty was signed by all diamond-producing African countries to keep "conflict diamonds" out of Western retailers.  However, this treaty isn't perfect and even to this day, many diamonds make it through this somewhat loose treaty and make it to stores near you.<br /><br />I may sound like a bleeding heart liberal on this issue, but this is pretty much the only issue I feel this way about.  I'm pretty much a hard conservative when it comes to everything else, but mining diamonds is pretty much legalized slavery and people die for the slighest infringement on their so-called duties.  Women really need to think twice before they request a huge rock from their fiances.  How many people have to die for you to wear a piece of ice?</p></body></html>

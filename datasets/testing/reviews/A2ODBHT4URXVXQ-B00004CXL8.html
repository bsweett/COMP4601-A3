<meta name="summary" content="Oh boy. This movie is just about as good as it gets"></head><body><p>Somehow Helen Hunt manages to stand up to the power of Jack Nicholson in this role - and I can't think of many other actresses who would have been brave enough to try. But she does, and she does it well.<br />Nicholson is a writer of romance who struggles with OCD and MUST be waited on by Hunt in his neighborhood restaurant; all the other waitresses cower at the possibility of interacting with him, but she smacks him into place, tells him where to get off, and puts his food in front of him. She's got a severely asthmatic son, and when caring for him causes her to miss work, Nicholson steps in as the fairy godfather.<br />But, see, there's a real fairy in this movie: Nicholson gay artist neighbor (Greg Kinnear) who gets bashed up by thugs and loses everything, nearly including his dog, whose trip down the garbage chute is a side-splitting opening scene to the movie.<br />Can't say a lot more without ruining several of the subplots without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it yet. Let's just say that by the end, there's a glimmer of hope that the love (albeit reluctant love) of a good woman just may tame Nicholson's OCD demons.</p></body></html>

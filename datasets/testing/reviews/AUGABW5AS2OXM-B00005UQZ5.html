<meta name="summary" content="A Superior Movie!"></head><body><p>I always enjoyed the television series. The movie was just as good. Tommy Lee Jones played his role as a U.S. Marshall to the hilt. Harrison Ford was above average in his role as the wrongly accused doctor. The bus being hit  by the train was a unique special effects act. The plot of this movie was  outstanding as well. This movie even had the one armed man as the killer  just like the series that was on television. The associate of Dr. Kimbell's  being a party to the murder was another<p>unique twist. This was a well  written story as well as a fantastic movie. I have watched this for the  100th time. I will watch it 100 more times.Buy this video,you will not  regret it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrible Disney stuff"></head><body><p>This stuff was meant for children. Please do not watch this if you like the phantasy genre as this is like watching Lord of the Rings with only Hobit action. The four children from the cast do give things a try, but the lines that they are to pronounce are deeply annoying and very likely from another century. Especially the youngest girl truly got on my nerves! This is probably the clearest resemblence with Lord of the Rings as Frodo and Sam had lots of these tear jerking lines as well. The only violence you will get to watch in Narnia received a Disney treatment and the creatures Disney's studio came up with here are no fun at all. After half an hour I could not resist to use fast forward anymore. (SARR)</p></body></html>

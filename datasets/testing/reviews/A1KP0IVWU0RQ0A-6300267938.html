<meta name="summary" content="ford and wayne team for the 12th time and make the best western and wayne gives the proformance of his life"></head><body><p>i had the pleasure (i'll never tell how) to see this fantastic two disc transfer of ford and wayne's greatest teaming.the movie has never looked better,almost like it was made yesterday.the color and sound leap off the screen at you and the extras are all that a ford or wayne fan could want.<br /><br />  the story(part of which inspired star wars) of a returning civil war vet eathan edwards(wayne in a stark unforgiven role of the racial intolornce of the western hero).after  indians raid a settelement the men ride out to catch them. but it is a ruse as the indians attack the homestead while the men are away. edwards brother and family are killed and his young nince is taken hostage.<br /><br />  edwards then sets off on a mission to find the girl and much like capt. ahab nothing,not time,not money,or the fact that she may be a wife to one of the indians will slow him down. as the hunt goes on it becomes clear that eathan plans to kill her when he finds her,not the wayne hero that we are used to.<br /><br />  with a very famous last shot (that looks better than it has in years ) i can't say enough about how well they have done puting this two disc set together.<br /><br />  if you love westerns or just love great movies,YOU MUST HAVE THIS SET!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

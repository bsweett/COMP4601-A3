You're going to have to talk to the kids after the film to make sure they don't rebel against you.  Sure, it has plenty of good messages and humor mixed in there, but it doesn't hold down the subversive spirit of rock, which is envigorating.  Certainly the film is humorous and inspirational, but the plotline makes it sound like self-absorbed loafer dupes people into doing something that he couldn't have done himself and is forgiven. In other words, there's such a levity to serious subject matter like this that some people don't even realize how wrong Dewey's motives are. I have to give Jack Black and Richard Linklater credit because I don't think that anyone else could have pulled it off.  As for the DVD, it's excellent.  It captures the adult perspective of Black in the making of featurette, commentary, MTV's Diary of Jack Black. It also captures the kids who are broad draw for the film in the featurette, Toronto Film Festival Diary, commentary, and a portion of Jack Black's diary contains footage of them rehearsing songs for the soundtrack.  This DVD captures all the perspectives that you would like to see as a filmgoer who loves the film, like me.  Mike White, thank you for writing this for lovers of Black and Rock.  Extra points for acting in the movie as well, you were perfectly cast. That is all.</p></body></html>

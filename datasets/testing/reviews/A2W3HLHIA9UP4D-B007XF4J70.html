With all the hype that comes with this film, as well as many other "classic" films, such as "Citizen Kane", I was expecting a big let down. I'm from the younger generation, and a lot of these old movies made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, just don't appeal to me most of the time. But I must say that this film wasn't that bad. The plot stayed interesting and the ending had a good twist as well. However, I don't think that this movie should be recognized as being one of the best films of all-time.</p></body></html>

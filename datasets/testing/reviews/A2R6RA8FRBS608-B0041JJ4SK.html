<meta name="summary" content="The perils of youth make for a good time movie! GRIN"></head><body><p>Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle is indeed the plot of the movie; but make no mistake about it-it's a fun movie with some good twists and turns to make the ride fun. Of course, one night the two young men, Harold and Kumar, get the munchies and set out for some White Castle sliders. But can getting there be smooth? No way! We'd have no picture! GRIN<br /><br />Along the way to White Castle everything goes wrong but comes out funny for the audience, True, some of this isn't the high class type of subtle humor-but then if you're going to see it after hearing the title you wouldn't care, would you? (If you need Gone With The Wind, move along and skip this movie. If you liked Dude, Where's My Car?, then you'll LOVE this movie.)<br /><br />Harold and Kumar have to go through just about everything in their quest for White Castle sliders. They meet a sexy woman who wants them-but then they get turned off when her husband also wants into the bed! They are harassed by a tough gang, chased by cops, and have a "swell" time with a rabid raccoon.<br /><br />Younger people will have an easy time identifying with Harold and Kumar. It's also great that they include some things about the nastiness of humdrum work days with nasty politics. You wind up routing for the two heroes to get there! The fact that Harold and Kumar are Asian and Indian help flesh out their personalities and idiosyncrasies, too.<br /><br />But there's more! GRIN The DVD is unedited which may make you like it more; but maybe then you might not want to play this when the little ones are around! Doogie Howser, M.D. (Neil Patrick Harris) gets some screen time, and there are cameos by Jamie Kennedy and Ryan Reynolds.<br /><br />If you want to just relax and enjoy a fun movie without having to think too much, this is the movie for you. John Cho and Kal Penn do a great job of playing Harold and Kumar and the action moves swiftly, keeping people entertained.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood'ish Relevance minus Mainstreamish Touches"></head><body><p>Into The Wild is a Sean Penn film. He is the same guy who acted in the film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High as the indulgent youth with standout hair. Like you, I haven't watched half of the films I've been meaning to watch in 2007, so the fact that i watched this film was a big deal. It was Eddie Vedder's Society that piqued my interest. I watched this film five days back but it's one of those rare philandering seaking films, the relevance of which substantiates in days from first viewing.<br /><br />Into The Wild is not for all audiences but just like the man in the film, a 23 year old like me found it quite appealing in ways not quite comprehensible. To say the film is beautiful and profound would be apt. There are many scenes and locations which make me wonder how reading the book might have been. I like reading books but due to lack of an attention span and patience with one's self, I will never get around to reading this book.<br /><br />The film had flaws but it's only because this cynic won't let go that easily. I thought his reasons for being the way he is were showcased in a way not quite parallel than might have been true. I don't think it was the circumstances in his family that led him to be the way he was  but moreover, it was the unquestionable zeal for life in comradery one finds with nature that would egg him on.<br /><br />To all my fellow 23 year olds, watch this film.<br />To all Eddie Vedder fans, check the soundtrack out.<br /><br />I'm now left wondering how I should update my boring sense of adventure. Into The Wild stays.</p></body></html>

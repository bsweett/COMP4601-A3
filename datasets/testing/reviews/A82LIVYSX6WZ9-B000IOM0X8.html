<meta name="summary" content="Sahara is better then National Treasure.....a good time"></head><body><p>Matthew McConaughey (Dazed and Confused, Reign Of Fire, EDTV) and Steve Zahn (Suburbia, HappyTexas, JoyRide) play Dirk and Al, two treasure seeking guys who set out a journey to find a ancient civil war ship with a treasure of gold coins and Penelope Cruz (Woman On Top, Vanilla Sky, Blow) plays a doctor sent to Mali in which people are being poisoned. Some pretty good action sequences boosted by the 2 male leads' lively performances. William H. Macy (Cellular, Boogie Nights,Focus), Lambert Wilson (The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, Timeline), Patrick Malahide and Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty, The One, Broken Arrow) also star. Much funner and better then National Treasure, though in this one they should of trimmed the time down a bit...the time kept on dragging but still its a good action/adventure movie chock full but not the best. Based on the bestselling book by author Clive Clussler.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Comic Book Flick"></head><body><p>Worthwhile flick, another film based on a comic book character and worthwhile. Not only seeing Tony Stark in the lead as Iron Man, but co starring a Rhodes guy as War Machine, who is a black ripoff of Iron Man. They are both in the military and get rewarded at the end. I thought it was worth seeing. Special effects galore.</p></body></html>

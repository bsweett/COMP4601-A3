Then, upon watching this episode, we would realize that not all of our questions were answered, but instead left on the table to allow us to figure out ourselves or not at all.  That was a huge downfall for The Forgotten that really irritated me throughout the picture.  Here we had the gorgeous concept of abduction, a mother's ability never to forget the child she lost, and this enormous possibility of government conspiracies, but it literally went nowhere.  Throughout the film new concepts, new ideas, and possibilities that seem endless constantly attack us, but we are given no explanation.  That is what bothered me the most.  We had the framework for a very decent little sci-fi thriller, but instead director Joseph Ruben decided to go with a familiar story that would appeal to a non-intelligent audience instead of a crisp thriller that could have really bent your mind.  I wanted my mind to wrap around this film, but instead I think my mind fell asleep.<br /><br />Julianne Moore did a decent job in this film, but perhaps gave a bit too much emotion behind her character.  If she wasn't crying than she was screaming or running.  I wanted to see the strength of this woman and her perseverance to find her missing child, not this emotional nutcase that has a reaction to everything that happens to her.  I know that Moore can do a very emotionally heavy film, but I didn't think that this project needed her to be at such a top level.  Perhaps that is what was wrong with this film.  The focus was completely off.  Here we are focusing on the emotional struggle that Moore is going through, when we really should be trying to uncover the truth behind the disappearance.  There was nearly no attempt to find out the truth.  For some strange reason, I remember feeling like the honest truth was difficult for our actors to say.  I felt as if they were forced into this side event that would stop Moore from being so emotional.  Or, perhaps, nobody really knew what the truth was.  Here we had this huge surprise Shyamalan-esque styled ending, but I never really felt as if the actors were on the same page.  I could hear Ruben gasping from excitement in the background, but Sinise, West, and even Woodard seemed less surprised by it all.<br /><br />I think that this film didn't do as well as hoped because the lines between what type of genre this was were skewed.  Was it a sci-fi?  People flying up into the air just doesn't quite do it enough for me (kinda felt like a cheap way of explaining things).  Was Moore really just imagining all of this?  Yet another question that needed a definite answer by the end because there were so many other elements happening that a direct answer would have only strengthened the entire film.  Did anyone really care why the child was abducted?  It seemed a bit flimsy to me, but again, I am no mother.  I needed something, perhaps others did not, but there were these huge gaping plot holes in the film that needed to be filled somehow, but apparently the repairman couldn't make it to the set.  We just jumped from moment to moment without any further explanation or reasoning.  I cannot express this enough.  That is the ultimate downfall for this film, the utter lack of coherence and connection between everything.  I felt like I was watching a connect-the-dots that followed no order and the performers just went where ever they wanted instead of going from point A to point B.<br /><br />I think I have gone a bit sidetracked here, but when I think of this film, I just cannot put everything together.  I don't need something handed to me on a silver platter, in fact, I love movies that make me ponder the truth.  The sad part about The Forgotten is that I nearly forgot why I was watching it midway through the film.  I was connected to nothing and the unanswered questions that only broadened the scope of the film into this massive ordeal that nobody, from the director to the actors could handle.<br /><br />I would also like to comment on the DVD itself of this film.  For me, the theatrical version was much better than the extended version.  I have heard others say that they would prefer to watch the extended because it gives us a better answer to the end (and I won't get into unanswered questions again), but for me the original ending was a hair better.  Perhaps it is because I watched the extended first and it gave me such a sour taste in my mouth that the original might have just helped dissipate that sour sensation.  Either way, that is my two cents.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was nothing more than just your standard issue sci-fi thriller that could have been pushed into the category of interesting or creative if it wasn't so clich&eacute;d ridden with this overwhelming desire to be "secretive".  The secret is given away by the middle of the film, which still doesn't answer the questions that we have.  Ruben was working with too big of a concept for his britches with this project and you can tell by the finished product that more could have been done to capture the sensationalism of aliens and abduction.  It has been done before in other films, why couldn't he do it here?  Yet another question that will never be answered as this film becomes just another cinematic mediocrity.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></body></html>

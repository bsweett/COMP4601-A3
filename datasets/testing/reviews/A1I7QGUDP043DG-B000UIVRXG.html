<meta name="summary" content="Comedy with a twist."></head><body><p>Talk about your 'twisted comedies'! I loved it! There's plenty of shock factor mixed in with the laughs. I never would've guessed the end half of the movie would turn out the way it did. A cop who takes his job too seriously is sent out to a town that appears to be 'Mayberry'. Appearances can be so deceiving. Very entertaining film.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

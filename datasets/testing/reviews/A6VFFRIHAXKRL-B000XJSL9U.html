Live Free or Die Hard is just a fun ride with Bruce Wills reprising his McClane role also starring Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gaberial Justin Long as Matt Ferrell & Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy Genaro McClane. Your plot is the most straight forward of any of the Die Hard movies basically this guy Thomas Gaberial once worked for the Government & was fired for some s**t he shouldn't of done & him & his team are going to shut the entire country down by cyber terrorism. John McClane has to protect this kid Matt Ferrell from these terrorist's also his daughter is kidnapped. I know this wasn't the best explaination of the plot but it's straight forward. My only complaints were PG 13 & Timothy Olyphant was 1 dimensional & looked like he was talking through his teeth a lot. I mean didn't Olyphant watch Alan Rickman or Jermy Irons or even William Sadler. He wasn't terrible but Colonel Stuart had more personality. The action was very good the effects were top notch I'm sure that CGI was used but as long as it's good CGI I have no problem with it. So I like this but not as much as 1-3 becuse of PG 13 rating. I haven't seen the unrated version I would like to. Some weird things was 1 of the original titles was Die Hard Tears Of The Sun Justin Timberlake was in talks to play Jack McClane John's son. In fact the original plot had Jack McClane as the hacker. Brad Renfro auditioned for the Matt role. Ben Afleck was 1 choice to play Jack when McClane's son was involved in the original script. Jessica Simpson auditioned for the role of Lucy McClane. It took 4 months to edit the video package that was used as Thomas Gaberial's warning. This was originally not written as a Die Hard sequel. This was the only Die Hard sequel not mentioning the events of the Nakatomi towers. Ok something that makes me say what? Is oh it's unrealistic. DID YOU SEE ANY OF THE 1ST 3 MOVIES! Cause this is a Die Hard movie not a safe watered down Matt Damon action movie. I just wish we could've had a more charismatic villain. Justin Long was no Reginald Vel Johnson or Samuel L Jackson but I liked him & Lucy in this movie So they gave good performances. . Other than PG 13 I'm  cool with this movie it's a good sequel.</p></body></html>

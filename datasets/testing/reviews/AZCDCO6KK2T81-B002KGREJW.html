<meta name="summary" content="A dysfunctional family that manages to function"></head><body><p>This is an odd film and it's down right creepy in places, but it also makes you smile too.  In that sense it is like real life.  Many families today are dysfunctional and, sadly, many end up breaking apart.  This film, contrary to some critical commentaries here, does not glorify the dysfunctional family as much as it seems to respect those that manage to stay together and support one another in spite of their idiosyncrasies, issues, self-absorbed claptrap and the like.  These characters aren't all likable, but that makes them all the more real.  That doesn't mean that their dysfunctional behaviors are being "glorified" as I've seen written in some reviews here.<br /><br />Yes, the grandfather is something of a stereotypical old pervert who loves to use the "f" bomb at every turn, and is an addict to boot, but no one will doubt that he loves, even adores, his granddaughter, and even though he appears to be very intolerant of his self-centered, narrow-minded, unforgiving son, he loves him anyway and even tells him how proud he is of him even when he doesn't agree with his mission in life, which fails.  He at least admires his son's guts in trying to succeed at something.  I think that is the focus here and not his flaws.<br /><br />Yes, the son seems to be a stereotypical self-absorbed, intolerant, cold, and counter-cultured just for the sake of being different teen-ager, but he really does love his family.  His shirt, "Jesus was wrong" notwithstanding, doesn't make him anything more than a confused teen-ager with a heart he tries to hide.  He even apologizes to his family at one point.  To point to this film as anti-Christian is just reading too much into it (the shirt, the conduct of the actors and so forth).  If we use this character and his famous shirt as an excuse or evidence that this film is somehow anti-Christian, then we ignore his good qualities that are far more memorable and far more important than his poor fashion counter-culture t-shirt.<br /><br />My only real issue with the film it that it is very unevenly paced and that often puts off an audience.  Regardless of that the acting is nothing less than terrific by all the actors involved.  Toni Collette is perfect as the caring by burned out wife to a pipe-dreaming husband, excellently portrayed by Greg Kinnear, who hopes to be the next self-help guru.  Alan Arkin is convincing as the grandfather and a very restrained Steve Carell is perfectly cast as the gay brother who attempts suicide early in the film.  Paul Dano gives a interesting performance as the son who can't stand living in the "hell" of his dysfunctional family.  Lastly Abigail Breslin, "Signs" fame, is wonderfully cast, as the forever optimistic girl who longs to be the next "Little Miss Sunshine", but already is in our hearts and her family's hearts.  She is just irresistible in the role.  Just as every large family seems to have the black sheep, the responsible one, and the one that everyone can rely on to bring a ray of sunshine onto any family tragedy, so this family has Breslin's character.</p></body></html>

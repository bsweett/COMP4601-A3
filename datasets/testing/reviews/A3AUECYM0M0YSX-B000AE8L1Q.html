<meta name="summary" content="* * 1/2  Desperate Housewife"></head><body><p>A romantic comedy with the likes of Joan Allen and Kevin Costner should catch fire, shouldn't it?  So why is this "witty" and "poignant" character-driven film from writer/director/actor Mike Binder flat as a pancake?  Maybe because it's not witty nor poignant, but it seems to think it is.  The Upside of Anger trots out tired cliches--the bored and boozy suburban housewife, the middle-aged has-been trying to find himself (Costner stretching himself in another washed-up baseball player role), the daughters coming of age, dealing with sex and boyfriends and having runs-ins with mom every other day.  There doesn't seem to be a big point to it all--does Binder think he's telling us anything new?!?  There are also way too many cribs, or attempted cribs, from Terms of Endearment, including a sudden serious hospital illness, to make this seem like anything more than a tired conceit of a movie wallowing in pretention.  (Plus it just reminds you how fresh Terms of Endearment was in 1982.  But 2005 is not 1982.)  Allen, always natural and effortless, gets to strut her stuff as the middle-aged mom with a fondness for Grey Goose vodka; Costner is well-cast--he never displays much range but in the right role he fits like a comfortable old pair of shoes.  Binder gives himself a major role as a radio producer in a subplot that goes littlewhere and seems more like a vanity trip than an exploration of anything germaine to the movie.  The love interest of one daughter, Dane Christensen, has a pointless role, that climaxes puzzlingly when he smashes through a glass window while bungee-jumping from a tree (and if that makes little sense to you, it makes even less sense in the context of the film).  The four daughters themselves (Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood) are bland and interchangeable--maybe one daughter less and one subplot less would have given the movie more focus.  But even better would have been more unique situations and setups for the conflicts, which are as forseeable as an Iraq quadmire.  Too often in this movie mom just pops off on the typical things TV and movie moms pop off on all the time: mouthy children, the claustrophobia of suburbia, neighbors who want to get them between the sheets.  Although the film tries the patented James L. Brooks formula of lurching from hilarity to pathos in an eyeblink, here the quips aren't funny, the drama not fresh, the psychological underpinnings pedestrian.  We've seen it all before--on Desperate Housewives, for example, to which stylistically this movie bears more than a passing resemblance, especially when it comes to the undistinguished music score (amazingly, composed by Alexandre Desplat, who turned out far more unique and extraordinary work for the Nicole Kidman film Birth; this one he seems to have phoned in).<br /><br />Well, we've *almost* seen it all before.  At the very end there is a twist so unusual that I have to admit I was totally taken by surprise for once.  The official Amazon review calls it "wrongheaded," but I disagree: this oddball direction is just what the rest of the movie needed.  But is it worth waiting two hours for?  For me, the answer is definitely no.  Joan Allen, I love you, but better luck next time.<br /><br />The DVD looks great, with a near-perfect transfer.  There are commentaries and the obligatory "making of" documentary, but this film left me so bored that I cared about neither.  More tellingly, there's a trailer that has the life and snap and energy that the film itself desperately needed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great comedy movie with gut busting gags"></head><body><p>I have to say this movie was very funny to me. They got very carried away on the movie, but I enjoy all the crude humor, slapstick comedy moments, and a few moments were I thought this could happen to anyone.  Plus their were a few scenes that made my gut and ribs hurt like crazy from laughing so hard.  So if you need a good comedy movie with over the top gags and humor then pick this DVD up and keep the laughs going all night long while hanging with friends or just having an eveing of unwinding with drinks and whatever else you desire for the night.</p></body></html>

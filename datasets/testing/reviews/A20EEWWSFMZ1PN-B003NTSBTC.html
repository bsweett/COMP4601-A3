<meta name="summary" content="Updated "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (1920)"></head><body><p>The date is 1954. A patient is missing from an asylum (Ashcliff). Yet it seems impossible. So ex World War 11 soldier, now U.S. Martial is sent to investigate. What he finds or does not find on the island of secretive people will intrigues us as the story mores into much more than a simple investigation.<br /><br />If the Dr. Caligari story had not been done repeatedly so many times over the years, this film may have been surprising and more enjoyable. As with all hybrids, there were some tossed in dashes of "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962), "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956) and maybe the kitchen sink for good measure and voila. Does Marin Scorsese think no one goes to the movies? He cannot be that naive. At least the actors (well known) were really acting and not walking through the script. Leonardo DiCaprio is believable as Teddy Daniels. The music is also a character and does not overwhelm the dialog. A nice touch was any blood looked more like theatrical makeup so it did not overwhelm the story.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare to others.<br /><br />I have to admit that I have not read the book yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAH9YI">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Enhanced) 1920</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000066AXE">A Beautiful Mind (Full Screen Awards Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767821629">The Thirteenth Floor</a></p></body></html>

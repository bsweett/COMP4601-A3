I am sure you know what it's about. What Cameron Crowe has done, is design a world that seemingly you feel a part of. This utopia where dreams in fact can and do come true, where if you just have some guts and some brawn and go with your heart, the road may lead to a different path than you first intended, where music placed in the most perfect of scenes can transport you to a time of endless love and karma and you can, if only for an hour or two, wonder why the world can be so cruel and unkind. Kate Hudson is radiant. I fell in love with Penny Lane. I wanted to run my fingers through her hair, let her cry on my shoulders, sing to her. I feel in love with Billy Crudup, his passion for music ignited another fire in me that was brewing for some time: to get out and see the small things that perhaps in the day to day heydey of living, I take for granted. If you haven't seen this yet, take the plunge, watch more filmmaking that crosses the threshold from simply a movie, to a journey.<br /><br />That my fine friend, that in all its joyous craft and benevolence is what Almost Famous is to me. A journey of the heart, a journey of the soul and a journey of a boy and a dream and the perservarance to give it all he could. Truly something that finally deserves 5 stars in my book. Cameron Crowe is a powerhouse with this motherload!<br /><br />So grab a handful of this and run with it, it deserves a place in your heart as well.</p></body></html>

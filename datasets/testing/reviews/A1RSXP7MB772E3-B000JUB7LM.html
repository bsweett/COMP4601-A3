<meta name="summary" content="the most heart felt story I have come across from the seats of the cinema."></head><body><p>The movie begins powerfuly, showing in development, characters that in the end, you will cry for, mourning painfully as you would for someone whom you truely care for.<br /> So ironic Clint is, a man known for his violence, but alas in the autumn of his life he has viewed violence in the horrific consequences that they come with. As in mystic river or Unforgiven, and lastly, and more importantly Million dollar baby. Hilary Swank was bred for this role, calling on her youth experiences in interviews, but like her character, who was driven and all heart, needed temperance from a wiser sort: Clint Eastwood. Eastwood seems to have the unflagging spirit that is throbbing in his films, when you think he is down and out of his career and you think it is over for him, he comes back anew!<br />  It gives me hope, watching films like this, a rekindling of past flames for film, that honestly, has died down, but every now and then is stoked by fine surprises! In an age where the latest trend is what was last best to sell, it is refreshing to see someone so romantic of times now past. Eastwood is a zeitgeist for his time, where movies were original and always changing, compelling viewers to go to the cinema and experience something creative. Not re-hashes and countless sequels! All of these things can be said of Million dollar baby, which I adore.<br /> Don't look to find politics in this beautifully poignant film, where, if you have the ill will, could fine. Instead, rather appreciate the story, because lets face it, Clint is not political in this film. Meaning he does not draw you to one side of a battle of controversy, or to the other. It is a movie you will not find in the documentary section, it is a piece of work, meant to be expressive emotionally. Not meant to pitch a campaign.</p></body></html>

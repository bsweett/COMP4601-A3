<meta name="summary" content="Saw Will Interrupt Sleeping Patterns..."></head><body><p>The nature of human motivation has usually two different sources that elicit a certain behavior.  These sources are either extrinsic or intrinsic.  Intrinsic motivation stems from within a person while the extrinsic source is influence generated by someone or something else.  Whether the source is external or internal it also presents a further division in needs and desires.  Needs being what a person requires to survive, and desires illustrates what a person wants.  Saw presents situations where human motivation is put to the test in regards to survival and the desire to live.  However, the situation that Saw presents comes at a dreadful price, which will undoubtedly terrorize the audience's own consciousness and perception of human needs and desires.<br /><br />The opening of Saw introduces two characters chained to heavy pipes in an abandoned bathroom at some unknown location where no one can hear them scream.  The room has intense lighting once the lights are turned on, which tosses no shadows of either character. In essence, it is a visual analogy for how their persona will be scrutinized by both parties, as the light will reveal everything.  Quickly one of the men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), questions why they are there because if someone desired them dead it could have been accomplished long ago.<br /><br />When the light is turned on for the first time, Adam (Leigh Whannell), discovered that he is not alone in the room, as between him and Dr. Gordon there is a corpse with a gun in it's hand and a tape recorder in the other.  It seems as if the corpse has blown away part of his own cranium with the gun in his hand.  Under the intense light the two chained men begin to search for ways of escaping, while they begin to discover small clues of what is expected out of them.<br /><br />It seems as if Adam is expected to kill himself, which he finds out through a tape that he finds in his own pocket.  Dr. Gordon discovers a similar tape and a bullet in his pocket that expresses anticipation in regards to Dr. Gordon who is expected to murder his new roommate.  The two men have a little more than six hours to find a solution to their deadly predicament.  During these six hours the audience is drawn into a number of flashbacks that provide information of how they were chosen to participate in this sick game.  It is also revealed that Dr. Gordon is aware of who the person is that has chained them in the unfamiliar room.<br /><br />Through Dr. Gordon it is disclosed that a serial killer that goes by the nickname Jigsaw has taken them hostage and chained them.  The killer himself has never actually killed someone, however, he has planned some truly grotesque schemes that have led to a tormenting death that has delivered pain of inconceivable magnitude.  The great extent to which the Jigsaw killer has planned his bizarre schemes will display a man with enormous amount motivation to seek some form of enlightenment in an outmost horrific manner.<br /><br />Saw dwells in the twilight land as it offers the audience a haunting journey that plunges deep into the darkness of the human psyche where nothing is sacred, as human motivation to live is skewed by an external source.  A mind to generate such horrors illustrates deep insights into psychology and human behavior, but it also displays the eccentricity of a creative mind.  James Wan and Leigh Whannell who created the story together offer a horror tale that evokes nightmares and difficult sleeping patterns in retrospect of the cinematic experience.<br /><br />The film had a good beginning theme, however, after about an hour and ten minutes the film seemed to begin slowly spiral downwards.  Nonetheless, Saw offers a truly ghastly film experience, which is built on good script and good mise-en-scene that helps enhance the terror in the story.  The camera work elevates the film, as it brings moments to the audience that will awaken feelings of revulsion and dismay.  In the end, do not expect a good night sleep, as Saw will haunt the mind for sometime after the end credits have been burnt into the retina of the audience.</p></body></html>

The acting ...you can't blame the actors. They could only work with the lines they were given.  The special effects were not too bad. The ending does make it worthwhile though. The effects in some of the scenes are good and advance what we saw in T2.  I was hoping that Stallone would be a cybernetic rival to Arnold..but I don't think they could agree on who would get more screen time.</p></body></html>

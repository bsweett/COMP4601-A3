<meta name="summary" content="A finest crafted suspense thriller with an O Henry twist"></head><body><p>With references to Hammer horror films and The Innocents (one of the best suspense thrillers of its type and a great ghost story as well based on Henry James' Turn of the Screw), The Others is the type of film America has forgotten how to make. It's intelligent, well acted with interesting twists and turns in its plot. I suspose The Others has as much to do with gothic thrillers as it does with more horror films.<p>Anyone expecting a jump out of your seat, blunt witless horror film should look elsewhere. Yes, the director does linger a bit too long on his mystery and it does take a bit too long to reach its climax but, on the whole, the film is a rewarding bit of entertainment. The performances are top notch and, again, the acting references the melodramatic style of Peter Cushing or  period dramas from the 40's and 50's. Kidman in fact is a perfect female counterpart to Cushing. Cushing's edgy, almost over the top performances were a highlight of even the weakest Hammer film. Here Kidman's acting choices seem inspired by both Cushing and the stable of Hammer actors from the 50's (including the underrated Michael Gough and Christopher Lee).<p>It's not The Matrix nor does it pretend to be. This fine film is a throw back to an older film tradition where a director actually expected intelligence from his audience. Approach The Others with an open mind. It's rather ironic, because I read a review posted at amazon that claimed Alien was a lame horror film. Remember, that horror is showing the audience but suspense is withholding until the very last minute. The later takes more skill. Hitchcock was a master of suspense (much like Ridley Scott is at his best). It's always scarrier not knowing what you're up against than having it all laid out for you.</p></body></html>

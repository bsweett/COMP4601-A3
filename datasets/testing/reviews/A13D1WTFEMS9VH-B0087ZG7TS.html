It is beautifully filmed and acted, but at the same time it hops around so much in POVs and time sequences that you lose your way - and interest. What's really going on and what is purely imagined? Even though this is integral to the story itself, the final payoff -- which you may find yourself tapping your toe awaiting -- is more, "Are you kidding me?" than "Wow!" American audiences may also find these emotionally straightjacketed Brits so intolerable that you'll want to scream, "Jesus Christ -- just tell her you love her already and kiss her!" Then there's the assortment of accents, some of which are so thick and mumbled I had to turn on the closed captions in order to understand them.<br /><br />'The English Patient' this ain't. More like, 'Better Be Patient, 'Cause it's English'.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another cute Disney flick"></head><body><p>All the big pieces fit the Disney formula: princess in distress, lovable rogue, wicked stepmother/senior advisor, a few musical numbers, and a Jiminy Cricket character - Pascal the chameleon, my favorite to date in his line of descent. Like any good recipe, though, it's what they do with familiar ingredients that makes this dish especially tasty.<br /><br />Rapunzel, although she has plenty of the pining princess about her, wields a mean fry-pan, though. Maximus, a mighty battle steed, gets some great parts to play, too - some of his "scent tracking" moves are a riot. In fact, anything the animators could do to make this a visual treat they did beautifully, including all the characters' motions as well as the ever-present hair. And the den of thieves - well, they're nice thieves. As happened with the little mermaid and so many other old stories, the Rapunzel of the classic fairy tales might not survive Disneyfication. Well, it's a fair story anyway, with plenty of adventure but with nothing truly dark enough to upset the little kids that thronged  the showing I saw. As always with Disney flicks of this kind: good, but forgettable.<br /><br />- wiredweird, reviewing the 2D release to theaters</p></body></html>

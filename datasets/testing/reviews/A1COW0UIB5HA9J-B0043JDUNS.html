<meta name="summary" content="Very good sequel and a solid blu-ray"></head><body><p>After the events of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) has revealed to the world and himself that he is Iron-Man as he is making history. Ivan Vanko (Michael Rouke Jr.) avenges his father's death whom his father believed his ideas were stolen by the Starks years ago, Ivan becomes Whiplash who is hellbent on destroying Stark. However, Tony is dealing with some health problems from that radiation of his artificial heart energy source but needs to make an improved one that can cure him and make him better. Now with the help of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), James Rhodes (Don Chadel), Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and BlackWidow (Scarlett Johanson) he must conflict an enemy worse than the last one he dealt with.<br /><br />A terrific and entertaining sequel to the surprisingly well done 2008 Marvel film, Jon Feravue returns back as director. I like how this movie deals with conflict including great character development and good acting. The action sequences are even bigger this time around including a very satisfying race track sequence that is just mind-blowing. There's also psychological issues in the film on the main character's conflict about what he is dealing with even with his love for Pepper. I should say this is a very good sequel that sets up for "Thor" at the very end of this movie.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray/DVD combo offers fresh brilliant picture and sound quality that skyrockets to the roof with wonderful extras like audio commentary, Footage Scan Mode which explores SHIELD data that pops up during the movie, The Vault which digs deeper into weapons and all that kind of stuff. On-and-off storyboards and animatics during the movie, 8 deleted scenes, documentary, featurettes, art galleries, trailers, music video and Marvel trailers.</p></body></html>

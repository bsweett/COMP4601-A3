<meta name="summary" content="Makes adults into kids again , very funny & entertaining"></head><body><p>I loved this film because of the James Bond influences , which  are in the plot , the music and the atmosphere also - at times .<br /><br />It was funny and quite poignant at times . I have no problem with something that is designed to be for mass acceptance if it's this good . I knew I was getting subtly manipulated , but at least this is only a movie .<br /><br />How any other adults have enjoyed shows like SHREK and FINDING NEMO ? I have and look forward to others like them .<br /><br />If only the live action comedies were as good as these animated ones .<br /><br />This is a great little diversion for those looking for a popcorn movie .</p></body></html>

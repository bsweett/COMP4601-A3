<meta name="summary" content="Great Special Effects, but Little Else"></head><body><p>Day After Tomorrow is a great film in the visual sense. It uses all sorts of excellent special effects to make it look like the planet Earth is about to be overtaken by weather- related disasters. But aside from the great special effects work, this film is really nothing special.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is the main star in this film and, once again, his performance is only average. The other actors/actresses in the movie are also average. None of them delivers an Oscar- caliper performance, but none of them are really bad, either. In this area, the film gets a passing grade, but not by much.<br /><br />The other problem I have with this movie is the plot itself. With a story like this- one of such Earth shattering, weather- related proportions- so much could have been done to make the movie more interesting and more entertaining. But the director, Roland Emmerich, decides instead to make the film rather dull and forgettable. To give you an idea, one of the major parts of the storyline involves Dennis Quaid heading for New York to find his son. All of these global weather changes are taking place all around and people are fighting for their lives and here's Dennis Quaid's character hiking through the snow to reach New York.<br /><br />Political messages pop up all throughout this movie and I don't know if the director was trying to push a particular point of view or not, but it seems like he was. The topic of global warming and its potential to be a disaster, the subject of foreign debts owed to U.S. banks, and other political talk come up throughout the movie and it appears that Emmerich is trying to persuade viewers to take political action.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, but only because of its great special effects. The rest of the film- the acting, plot, script, etc.- are average or below average. But watching those gigantic waves crashing through the streets of New York City makes this film worth a look.</p></body></html>

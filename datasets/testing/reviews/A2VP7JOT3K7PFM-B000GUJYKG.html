<meta name="summary" content="Story about a cop who is "the fly in the ointment...the monkey on the wrench, the pain in the a*s""></head><body><p>+++++<br /><br />"You got thirty or so hostages on the thirtieth floor [of the forty-story Nakatomi Plaza building located in Los Angeles].  The leaders name is Hans...They got a[n]...arsenal here...missiles, automatic weapons and...plastic explosives...They're down to nine [of twelve] now...these guys are mostly European judging by their clothing labels and cigarettes.  They're well financed and very slick...Add all that up...you got some bad-a*s perpetrators.  They're here to stay."<br /><br />The above is what New York city cop John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is on the building's 35TH floor, says on Christmas Eve by walky-talky to L.A. cop Al Powell (Reggie Veljohnson), McClane's cop outside the building contact.<br /><br />How did McClane get himself into this situation?  He has just arrived in L.A. and the Nakatomi Plaza building to spend the Christmas holidays with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) who works for the Nakatomi Corporation and is at the Nakatomi office Christmas party with the other employees.  (The building is empty except for those employees at the office party.)  But as John waits for his wife's office party to end, "terrorists" take control of the building.  As Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his fellow "terrorists" take hostages (McClane's wife being one of them), the bare footed McClain slips away unnoticed with only his service revolver, his cunning, and plenty of chutzpah.  The fun and action now begin as the lone McClaine attempts to save his wife and the other hostages.<br /><br />As the movie continues, others outside the building get involved: the L.A. police department, the FBI, and the television news.<br /><br />Note that McClane is just not fighting the "terrorists" but fighting the building as well as he tries to maneuver his way through it.<br /><br />The acting is in a word: fantastic.  Whether Bruce Willis as John McClane is climbing up an elevator shaft, throwing himself off an exploding building, or racing barefoot across a floor littered with glass, he holds our attention while we as watchers hold our breath.  Willis as a "good everyday guy" trapped in a situation fighting alone against overwhelming odds is the perfect blend of vulnerability, machismo, smart-aleckness, bravery, and funny one-liners.  (In fact, there is humor throughout this movie.)<br /><br />Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber redefines the action genre villain.  His charm lies in a volatile mixture of violence and cunning, all hidden in a gentleman's civility.  Bottom line: Hans is no ordinary "terrorist."<br /><br />All the supporting cast give solid performances.  Noteworthy are Bonnie Bedelia (as the wife in danger), Reggie Veljohnson (as McClane's cop-on-the-outside contact), and William Atherton as a slimy, tabloid journalist.<br /><br />The special affects in this movie are a sight to behold.  All background music adds to each scene especially Beethoven's "Ode to Joy."<br /><br />This movie is based on the novel "Nothing Lasts Forever" (1983) by Roderick Thorp.  It was later renamed "Die Hard."<br /><br />This movie has, so far, spawned two sequels: "Die Hard 2: Die Harder" and "Die Hard 3: Die Hard With a Vengeance."<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras, all of them interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, with explosions, guns, shattering plate glass windows, and death-defying jumps, "Die Hard" stands out as "the" action movie!!<br /><br />(1988;  2 hr, 10 min;  wide screen;  55 scenes, rated `R')<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant Triumph For Sean Penn, Gus Van Zant & Cast!!"></head><body><p>I am so glad that this story has been told and done such justice<br />by the great Sean Penn as Harvey Milk, a true pioneer &<br />sacrificial lamb in the ongoing struggle for gay rights in america!<br />Gus Van Zant's direction was great, Josh Brolin perfectly<br />captured the tortured, angry & confused Dan White, who<br />murdered both Milk & Mayor Moscone and got off with basically<br />a slap on the wrist for it! Kudos also go to the other<br />stellar cast: Emile Hirsh, James Franco, Diego Luna and others.<br />I'm glad that the younger generations of gay, bi, and<br />supportive straights can have a chance to learn of<br />Harvey Milk and understand the heavy price that has<br />been paid for the few freedoms that gay men & women enjoy today,<br />and how easily it can all be taken away if they don't know<br />their history or become too complacent in the struggle<br />and stop fighting.<br />In 1978 it was Proposition 6, which Milk helped get overturned...<br />today, almost 30 yrs to the day, it was Proposition 8 which<br />got voted in and took back some of the freedoms that young<br />gay people just took for granted and assumed were their just due.<br />I was a 14 yr old kid, just coming into the knowledge of my<br />homosexuality at the time that Milk & Mayor Moscone were assassinated.<br />I didn't get the full gravity of what had happened at the time,<br />but I knew it was something tragic and pivotal!<br />Of course years later, at the age of 20 in 1984, I saw<br />"The Times Of Harvey Milk" and was brought into full<br />knowledge at that point.<br />"NEVER BLEND IN, NEVER SLEEP, & FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!!"<br />Became my mantra from that point on! (-:<br /><br />God Bless Mr. Milk for his courage to bear the weight of<br />the cross he carried for gay men & women in a time that was both<br />magical & scarry!--It's not everybody who can rise to the occassion<br />and stand up in the face of opposition and threat of death!<br />He truly laid down his life for his beliefs and for gay people!<br />My only points of contention were that they should've delved<br />into Mayor Moscone a bit more because he was a freind to<br />Harvey & his struggle and was well respected too!<br />He was a heterosexual man who was open-minded, educated,<br />fair & just in his heart and a loyal family man and freind.<br />He too died because he had the conviction to stand up for<br />what he felt was right, and as many tears were shed for him as<br />they were for Harvey Milk. He should always be remembered<br />and revered as well. Also, I thought they could've<br />found a more believable actor to play the iconic Sylvester...<br />if Harvey was the Mayor Of The Castro, Sylvester was<br />surely it's Queen!-- But then a biopic should be made<br />of his life as well! (-:<br />All-n-All, a great job though!<br /><br />R.I.P. Harvey Milk (1930-1978)<br />Mayor George Moscone (1929-1978)</p></body></html>

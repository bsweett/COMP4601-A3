I was trying to get a copy of Burt Reynolds's film of the same name, and got this one instead. A bit miffed at receiving the wrong disc, even though I saw this film a few years ago and knew that it was good, I decided to make the best of a bad situation and just rewatch the thing before sending it back. No sense in wasting a rental charge, eh? After all, it could have been much worse; they might have sent me something like "Sex in the City" or a Meg Ryan film. Anyway, arguably the most memorable elements of "Heat" include the pairing up of long time veteran actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, and the shoot out in the streets of Los Angeles that eerily foreshadowed a real event several years later. But "Heat" is much, much more than a vanity project or a footnote in the history of real life American bank robberies. This is a darn good action thriller that still holds up ten years after Mann wrote and directed it. The fact that Michael Mann plans on bringing "Miami Vice" to the big screen in the next year or so (groan) should in no way diminish what he's accomplished here.<br /><br />The film opens with a smoothly planned armored car robbery orchestrated by master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). Something goes horribly wrong with the job, though, when one of Neil's underlings guns down a couple of the guards for no reason. Although McCauley doesn't know it at the time, it is this event that spells his ultimate doom. Veteran homicide detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) signs on to the case, and he's a cop's cop, a real go getter that grabs hold of a case with both hands and doesn't let it go until he's got his man. He foregoes everything in his life, his marriage to third wife Justine (Diane Venora) and his relationship to her troubled daughter, to pursue bad guys. Oddly enough, Neil McCauley does the same thing. He's so involved in planning and carrying out his next heist that his personal life is a vacuum. Even when he strikes up a relationship with the pretty Eady (Amy Brenneman), he can't let go of his work. Other characters in the film have the same sorts of problems, especially McCauley's partner Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd), who quarrel constantly about money and Chris's lifestyle.<br /><br />Hanna eventually discovers that McCauley and his goons are the guys behind the armored car heist, and McCauley learns that Hanna's on his trail at roughly the same time. In order to size his nemesis up, Hanna pulls over Neil on the highway and invites him to a restaurant down the street so the two can talk. It's an interesting scene, probably the best one in the movie, as both men dance around the other trying to get a feel for each other. They each come away from the encounter impressed with the fortitude of the other, recognizing that they both possess the same steely eyed determination to get what they want, but neither man plans on shying away from the coming conflict. That conflict comes when McCauley accepts a job requiring him and his gang to rob a downtown bank. They get out of the building with huge bags of money just fine, but Hanna and his "gang" of cops are right there to meet them. The resulting gun battle is breathtaking to behold, almost like a ballet of blood and bullets in the streets of Los Angeles. McCauley and Hanna escape the bloodbath to fight to the finish later on when Neil's failure to check his obsessive thirst for revenge leads him right into the detective's hands.<br /><br />The action scenes definitely grab your attention, but they play a minor part in the movie. "Heat" is all about the performances. It's astonishing to see this many recognizable faces in one film. Jon Voight plays a rough talking, pony tailed advisor to McCauley. Tom Sizemore turns up as one of Neil's reliable colleagues. Wes Studi, who also played a cop in Chris Eyre's "Skinwalkers," plays second fiddle to Pacino's detective. Look for Mykelti Williamson, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Jeremy Piven, Tone Loc, Xander Berkeley, and Bud Cort in major and minor roles. Wow! I'll bet Mann only had to say, "I'm making a film with De Niro and Pacino in it" to get people to sign on the dotted line. A few of these characters get their own minor stories that play out underneath the larger Pacino/De Niro confrontation, and Mann integrates them all masterfully. About the only problem I had with the film is that we don't get enough information on Kilmer's character's tumultuous relationship with his wife. We do learn enough to go on, that he's got money problems, but I wanted more.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed with the extras on the disc, mainly because there weren't any. At least the audio quality sounded great, particularly during that shootout. The gunfire was so loud coming out of my sound system that I'm surprised the neighbors didn't call the cops. The picture quality is good, too. They really ought to release a super duper special edition of this film, a version with commentary tracks, behind the scenes features, and deleted scenes. Clocking in at an impressive three hours, "Heat" is one of the better action films released by Hollywood in the last twenty years, a film that literally transcends the genre due to its intensive character driven plot. If you haven't seen it, better add it to your list soon.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beyond What I Have Expected of Kevin Spacey."></head><body><p>First of all, I am not that familiar with Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee's work, so I won't be able to make much of a judgement about the impersonations by Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth. I have hesitated on seeing this film, because I never expected to see Kevin Spacey in a musical biopic. To my surprise, I found his performance and singing to be very impressive. He really captured the essence of the old Hollywood performing style. His dance and singing gave me flashbacks of some of the old movies I have seen years ago. Kate Bosworth is convincing as Sandra Dee, because her youthful beauty is perfect to play her. I had no idea that Dee was not as sweet and nice like her movie images. She smokes and swears throughout the movie.<br /><br />Brenda Blethyn is amazing as Polly(Darin's non-biological mother who taught him to become an entertainer). Once again she proves that she's one of the best and versatile actresses from England and she does a very good American accent. Polly dies when Darin rose to the top of stardom as singer and movie star. Darin eventually persued the lovely Sandra Dee when when they were making a film together in Italy. Despite the disapproval of her controlling mother(Mary, played by the scene-stealing Greta Scacchi), they eventually fall in love and get marry.<br /><br />Life is good to Darin, he has money, a beautiful wife, a successful career, and gets nominated for an Oscar. Then his life goes downhill when his career comes crushing down.  He eventually have to go work the stages of Las Vegas in his prime in order to stay in the game. During that time, his biological mother confessed to him that Polly was not his real mother, and he was shocked by the news.....<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this film more than De-Lovely and Ray, because it's not as depressing, and it's more of a feel good musical biopic. This is probably Kevin Spacey's best work since American Beauty.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You're Never Too Old For An Adventure"></head><body><p>From the moment the silhouette of that famous fedora crosses the screen, you'll feel that old surge of movie-house giddiness that you felt the first time you went to a darkened theater to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>. Indy is older...a bit greyer and a bit creakier, but he still has a killer smile and a rapier wit to go with that twinkle in his eye. So when the nasty Ruskies (the Cold War now replacing WWI) kidnap Indy and take him to Area 51, the thrill ride kicks in almost from the very start to the sounds of Elvis Presley and John Williams.<br /><br />Seems the mythic artifact this time around is an alien skull, and the Russians want it. A kicking Cate Blanchett is Col Dr Irina Spalko, Soviet Psychic Baddie who has kidnapped Professor Oxley (John Hurt) and Marion (the welcome return of Karen Allen), and "Mutt" (the ubiquitous Shia LeBeouf) now enlists Dr Jones to help rescue them and save the world. Along the way, they must overcome a nuclear blast, carnivorous ants, waterfalls and the usual cavalcade of bad guys with guns in moving vehicles. Yes, the plot is obvious. But when you watch the older DVD's, I was a bit taken aback at just how obvious the old plots were. As Dean Stanforth says early in the film, "We seem to have reached the age where life stops giving us things and starts taking them away."<br /><br />"Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull" is no-where near as bad as some of these aging fan-boys make it out to be. It's a darn sight better than 1984's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a>, and lacks only the magnetic presence of Sean Connery to equal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>. The humor of the originals is intact, and Jones/Ford takes the wind out of the aging issue with some great lines and sight gags (fave line from Mutt - "for an old man you ain't bad in a fight. What are you, like 80?"). The usual wild white-knuckle chases through the jungle are terrific, even if you've seen it before.<br /><br />Ok, so the alien thing might be a bit harder to swallow than Holy Grails for the X-Files generation. And I did kind of miss the old fashioned non-CGI booby traps. But that doesn't detract from the basic fact that this is Steven Spielberg and George Lucas firing on all cylinders, and a welcome addition to the Indiana Jones Legacy.</p></body></html>

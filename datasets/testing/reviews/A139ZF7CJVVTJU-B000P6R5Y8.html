<meta name="summary" content="Reality Check"></head><body><p>As a movie about the lost powers of the imagination, "Terabithia" is a mixed blessing.  Kids today have a lot of digital and electronic crutches on which to prop up their creative spirit; it's nice for a story to encourage the limitless scope of the human mind.  Fifteen year old Jesse Aarons, an aspiring artist, has a home life that offers little in the way of dream nourishment, so it is no surprise when he quickly befriends the New Girl In School, Leslie Burke, a young naif with a spirit as wholesome and wide-eyed as her cute little face.<br /><br />Jesse and Leslie soon discover their own little paradise in the woods behind their house.  They call this land Terabithia and dress it up with their "wide open" minds.  Disney helps the jaded viewer out by giving us sometimes rich, sometimes ambivalent CGI depictions of their pretend world, but they are rare.  This is just as well; the movie wants us to rediscover the wonder of our own minds, but it leaves very little of the story up to our own imaginations.<br /><br />I have to wonder if the emotion of the film (and it wants to have so much emotion) wouldn't have more impact if there was more humanity to back it up.  It shows us a world of heartless bullies (some misunderstood and hurting; some just plain malicious), pesky but endearing little sisters, and happy vs. struggling homes, and then balances this out with brief moments of care-free, play-land giddiness.  It can't have both, at least not in equal measure.  It sacrifices some of its heart and soul for the kindling flash of its fantasy world, and vice versa.<br /><br />By the time Jesse's absurdly hot music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, offers (out of the blue!) to take him (alone!) to a museum, it's hard to figure out just what is real and what isn't (this movie's world must exist before things like permission slips were invented).  At any rate, this becomes the marker for the movie's last bit of credibility, where Jesse and Leslie's world runs headlong into harsh reality.  What follows are a series of events that pretend to be saturated with import, but which are instead progressively longer and more maudlin.  By the time all was said and done, this reviewer felt cheated.  The flick pretended to be magical, but I could see the rabbits hiding in its hat.</p></body></html>

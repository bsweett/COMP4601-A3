<meta name="summary" content="Emperor Penguin's Life Struggle Captured"></head><body><p>DEFINITION OF "DOCUMENTARY": 'Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration.' *** I've mentioned the definition here because some reviewers perhaps don't understand what a documentary is or what it's supposed to be. There are no bombs exploding, no Hollywood movie stars here, no wiz-bang CGI special effects. Knowing what a "documentary film" is supposed to be - maybe they would have rated this film (or any other documentary) higher (?)<br /><br />THE FILM: Amazing. Joyous. Sad. Sweet. Remarkable. This (almost) 80-minute film presents the year long struggle of the Emperor Penguin in the freezing Antarctic. Starting out in the penguin's ocean home, making the arduous 60+ mile journey to their mating grounds, the 2 week long mating ritual, the mother bird laying a single egg, the mother's trek back to the ocean for food, the fathers staying with the eggs for 2-3 months, the mother returning and then the male goes back to the ocean to feed... and this back-and-forth trip by each sex happening several times until the chick is several months old. Not to mention all this happens with the egg exposed to the frigid air and touching the ice for only seconds at a time, or it would otherwise freeze. Then it's the trek back to the ocean for everyone that survived. Much praise goes to the film team for spending 13 months of their lives to bring us this feature. The brutal cold (average -50 to -80 degrees), sever wind (20-120 mph), no food, and little or no light during the winter months makes you wonder - how do the penguins do this year in and year out (for thousands of years). An incredible journey. Sound is crisp Dolby 5.1 and the cinematography is grand.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Bonus features consist of 2 documentaries - 1. "Crittercam" a 25 minute segment showing the penguins strategies for eating and survival underwater, and 2. "Of Penguins & Men" an approx 50 minute behind the scenes look at the penguins and the team making the film. Also included is a classic Bugs Bunny short cartoon "8 Ball Bunny" from 1950.<br /><br />OTHER WORTHY DOCUMENTARY FILMS: If you're into documentary films, check out "Touching The Void" (2003), "IMAX: Dolphins", "IMAX: Africa - The Serengeti", and Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me". All are eye-opening educational experiences.</p></body></html>

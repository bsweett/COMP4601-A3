<meta name="summary" content="Pulp Fiction"></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino's ultra-hip film that put John Travolta back on the map is one of the most effortlessly entertaining films in cinema history. The top cast of Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis are all great in their decidedly off-beat roles. The unique approach to the material is played out in the grandest sense, with the &quot;backwards&quot; events and commendable wayward camera techniques. The classy soundtrack (one of my favourites) is equally impressive. At times confusing, it's a film that has to be watched several ways through get the jist of it. Tarantino's hard-as-nails direction makes this one somewhat hard to sit through. With the comical M.O taken with people getting four shades of guano blown out of them, it proves to be an uneasy watch. But it's enjoyable on so many levals, including counting how many time the &quot;F&quot; word is said. Zilch DVD extras, dissapointing for such a groundbreaking film.</p></body></html>

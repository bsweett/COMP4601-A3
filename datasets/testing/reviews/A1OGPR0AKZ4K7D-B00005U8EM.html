It has a powerful combination of great writing, a wonderful cast, and even a lesson to learn.  It also has a nice combination of comedy and romance, so that neither are neglected.  Bill Murray is phenomenal!  He starts out this shallow shell, and undergoes character development and change, but it is gradual and believable.  Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot were great choices for supporting characters.</p></body></html>

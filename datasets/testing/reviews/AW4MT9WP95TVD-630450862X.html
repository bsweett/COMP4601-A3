<meta name="summary" content="Amazingly thrilling and moving horror film"></head><body><p>Other than Delores Claiborne, I still think Carrie is the best adaptation of a Steven King novel.  The diary format of the book is shelved for straight narrative and it is beautifully told and brilliantly cast.  Spacek and Laurie deservedly received Oscar nominations, Allen, Travolta. Irving and Soles are perfect for their parts.  Very gorey and frightening at times, it's still heartbreaking and moving at others.  This is one of DePalma's best achievements and even at its age, it's timeless.  One of the best horror flix ever.</p></body></html>

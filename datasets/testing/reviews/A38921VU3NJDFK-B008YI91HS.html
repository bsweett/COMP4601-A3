<meta name="summary" content="Jurassic Park (1993)"></head><body><p>Another instant classic from Steven Spielberg, this spectacular translation of Michael Crichton's famous novel entertains with constant, enduring bouts of excitement and a full plate of terrorizing sequences as memorable as they are awe-inspiring. A forewarning of the possible cataclysmic effects of meddling with biology and genetics, Jurassic Park exercises one of the most engaging, smartly-conceived plots in Hollywood history--simple, yet beyond the realm of most peoples' imaginations. Spielberg's use of special effects (in particular, animatronics) is absolutely perfect--the dinosaurs are more realistic than anything similar that anyone's ever seen. This film's cast is pleasant and applicable, and its sound effects rival its visuals, making it one of the most technically flawless films of all time. For any film aficionado, this is an absolute essential piece of any DVD collection.</p></body></html>

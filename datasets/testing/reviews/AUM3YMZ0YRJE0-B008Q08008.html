<meta name="summary" content="polanski does it again..."></head><body><p>not only has he made another unbelievably excellent holocaust film, but he it bears his indefinably quirky stamp.  While the basics of the film have been covered in the reviews, what struck me was that this protagonist is not some superhuman hero type, but merely a highly talented man trying to survive - he avoids fighting, relies on his elite contacts, and ventures out only when he can't avoid it.  Lots of his time is spent in solitude, waiting fearfully and introspecting.  This made him a kind of everyman, with whom I for one could identify far more than some otherwordly figure like Martin Gray, whose story of survivaly is as intimidating as it is fantastic.  This film reveals how most of us would have gone about trying to survive:  it required pluck and courage, but also luck and avoidance of danger.  The acting is also perfect.<br /><br />Also, the extra of Polanski speaking aobut his childhood - and how he survived a near-identical situation, is incredibly moving and fascinating.  This film is perhaps his most important, for himself.  One wonders what his career would have been like had he stayed in Hollywood.  I must say that, given the repertoire of films he has done since then, such as this or Tess, his first-rate talent was not diminished.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is one of the first films I will show to my children when they are ready to learn about the holocaust.</p></body></html>

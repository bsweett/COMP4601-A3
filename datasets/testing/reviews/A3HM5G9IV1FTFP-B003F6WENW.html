<meta name="summary" content="Mildly Amusing"></head><body><p>"Wedding Crashers" is clearly aiming to be a raunchy comedy with a heart of gold the way "The 40 Year Old Virgin" was. But where "Virgin" succeeded in being both uproariously funny and genuinely touching, "Wedding Crashers" only comes across as mildly amusing. Vince Vaughn is funny and charming as usual, playing a motormouthed, hapless rascal. As his wedding crasher buddy, Owen Wilson basically just phones in his performance, and I almost can't blame him ... he's basically been "that guy with the nose and hair" in every recent Hollywood buddy flick. Rachel McAdams, who plays Wilson's love interest, is absolutely adorable, and steals the film, but it's too bad that her romance with Wilson isn't nearly as believable as she is. As for the comedy, some of the jokes hit and some of them miss, making "Wedding Crashers" a pleasant but uneven and lukewarm film.</p></body></html>

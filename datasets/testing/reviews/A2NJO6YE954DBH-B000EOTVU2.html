<meta name="summary" content="They play dirty  Down Under when it comes to Splatter Flicks"></head><body><p>"Wolf Creek" is one of the most brutal splatter slicks I have ever seen.  I watched it during the daylight with the shades up and that did nothing to mitigate the bad parts of this one.  If you are tired of horror films that wimp out and/or rely too much on special effects, then this 2005 effort from Down Under is for you.  If you watch horror films for the cathartic experience, then stay away from this one, because once you climb down into the abyss on this one you do not really get back out the whole way.  Not even close.<br /><br />Liz Hutner (Cassandra Magrath), Kristy Earl (Kestie Morassi), and Ben Mitchell (Nathan Phillips) are a trio of young adults who decide to go hiking in the remote but scenic Wolf Creek National Park in the Australian Outback.  On the way there they stop at a roadhouse and Ben has a run in with a mean looking customer, which is the sort of thing that does not bode well for young people in splatter flicks.  But these three have no idea.  It takes a while for things to start going wrong and a bit longer to get to the point where the bad things start happening and start building in intensity.<br /><br />In the featurette on the DVD McLean talks about wanting his serial killer, Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) to be an Australian icon and a counterpart to Freddie and Jason.  But Mick's humor ring hollow compared to Freddie because he is not a supernatural being and his victims are not stupid, oversexed teenagers who are killed in creative ways that allow you to take perverse pleasure in their deaths.  Mick takes out people the old fashioned way, with a knife and a high powered rifle.  "Wolf Creek" does not allow any buffers between you and the violence.  This guy is a sick bastard.  He is not particularly inventive when it comes to hurting people, he is just brutally effective in what he does.<br /><br />For many viewers the fact that is takes a while for things to start happening in this one will be sufficient reason to knock down the rating one star.  Not much happens in the first half of this film and it is not like the character development of Liz, Kristy and Ben is all that important.  But for me the part where I did the deduction comes when the victims have their best chance to get out alive.  Now, if there is one thing we have learned from these splatter flicks it is that the killer is down but never out.  When you get them down, do not stop, do not pass go, and do not go running off so they can chase you down.  Do whatever you need to in order to take them out.  Given that premise, if you have an empty gun and are precluded from shooting them, then it should be obvious where to hit them.  Unfortunately, that proves to be too obvious for the characters in this movie.  Still, the ending does not play out the way you would expect and there is a rather interesting shell game when it comes to who is the hero, which earns bonus points.<br /><br />I was curious as to what exactly were the true events on which "Wolf Creek" was based, because for all I knew it could be the statistics thrown at you in the beginning of the movie regarding how many people are lost in Australia each year.  But it turns out there is the case of Ivan Milat, a serial killer who was convicted for what are called the "Backpacker Murders" in Australia, and last year Bradley John Murdoch was convicted for killing a British backpacker.  Of course these simply serve as an inspiration for writer-director Greg McLean the way Ed Gein inspired "Psycho" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."  Besides, the question with splatter flicks is never whether they are true, but whether they come across as being real, and this one is ahead on that score at the end.</p></body></html>

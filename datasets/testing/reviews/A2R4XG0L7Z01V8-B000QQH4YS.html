<meta name="summary" content="Robocop vs Terminator?!"></head><body><p>First time I've ever watched this movie, and I only watched it cos I got it as a Christmas present. I was surprised how good it was! OK, it's a bit slow to start with, and I was getting slightly annoyed with the constant TV news clips.<p>I got the box set of the trilogy, and found there were two versions of the film to watch - the theatrical version and the director's cut. Which isn't something you often see on DVDs. Of course, I chose the director's cut, and regretted it. My dad had seen the original, so he was noticing the bits that weren't in the original. And I couldn't look at the screen, especially when Murphy was getting shot to smithereens. It was so graphic! You can see why it was probably sliced when it went to the cinemas. I didn't really notice what else was maybe sliced out. <p>Nancy Allen also stars in this. It took me a while to place her, as she a very severe, bad 80s haircut in this, but when I did place her, I couldn't believe it! It's Chris Hargensen from Carrie! The bad girl who pulled the rope on the bucket of blood. <p>Towards the end, you also see Robocop take off his headgear, which I hated, due to the fact that his face is so stretched! Ugh. Not a pretty sight. <p>I've always heard this film compared to Terminator. It is slightly. I found myself sympathising and feeling sorry for Robocop, the same way I did with the Terminator (mainly in the second &amp; third movies though). Robocop evokes the same feelings in you that happened during Terminator - if you don't have a heart of stone that is.<p>The action only really starts towards the end of the movie, and you feel so sorry as you watch Robocop have flashbacks of his previous life etc. But after watching the first one, I'm glad I have the second one to watch when I feel like it - I've been told bad things about the final in the trilogy!</p></body></html>

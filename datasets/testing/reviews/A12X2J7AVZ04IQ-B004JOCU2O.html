<meta name="summary" content="Another Tony Scott crowd-pleaser"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed "Unstoppable" for lots of reasons. There's very little soap opera back-story, as in so many disaster films, and the story gets off the platform from the beginning. At a crisp 96 minutes, this story that is "inspired" but not "based" on actual events is no end of fun and excitement. Acting is fine, and the editing is remarkable, as are the special effects.There's time to know the characters' motivations without intruding on the action at hand. This review may never be read, but I was compelled to get in my 5-stars. I had no problem with my enjoyment of "Unstoppable". Comparisons to "Runaway Train" with Jon Voight ('85) are not realistic. Different venue, different situations. The DVD I watched (Netflix) had no extras. That would've been nice.<br />UPDATE (8-24-12): So very sorry to hear of Tony Scott's tragic death. He will be missed.</p></body></html>

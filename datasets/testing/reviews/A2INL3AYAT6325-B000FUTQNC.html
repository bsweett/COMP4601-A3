<meta name="summary" content="Good, but could have been much better"></head><body><p>I have been a fan  & collector of Harrison's for  26 years now.<br /><br />I USED to be first in the door opening day for his films.<br /><br />This film was good.  But, COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.<br /><br />Some of the scenes just DID NOT work.<br /><br />Ending of the film, just walk away & that was it.  NO clearing up the whole situation to show the Jack character was innocent & only did these things because of the situation with his family.<br /><br />Did NOT like the children.  The boy Andy, bad.  When the bad guys first break in their home he is sacred of them but the next morning, "OH BAD GUY IS MAKING PANCAKES SO I GUESS HE IS NOT A BAD GUY".  Then, with a medical problem there is only 1 medication dose in the whole home to help him.  As a diabetic since the age of 6 you have MULTIPLES in the home in case of emergency.  Too easy a plot "twist".<br /><br />Kids do NOT pay attention to their parents, just the TV, computer or to music.<br /><br />Some of this were similar situations that happened in "Patriot Games" & "Air Force One".<br /><br />Like I said above, good film BUT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.<br /><br />DVD package.  At least Warner Brothers gave up on those card board (CAN NOT STACK THEM) DVD packages.<br /><br />BUT, YET AGAIN, A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME, NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST INSIDE THE DVD PACKAGE OR ANY OTHER FILM INFORMATION.</p></body></html>

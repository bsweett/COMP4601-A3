<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece made better"></head><body><p>Has it really been ten years since writer/director Alex Proyas (The Crow, I Robot) first unleashed the highly influential, groundbreaking, and underrated Dark City?  Yes it has, and to celebrate being a decade old, Dark City has finally been re-released as a Director's Cut that preserves Proyas' original vision.  Upon first viewing this director's cut of Dark City, you will notice some subtle differences, all of which help make Dark City even better than it was before.  Gone is Kiefer Sutherland's opening narration, leaving the viewer to attempt to figure things out for themselves before the plot exposes itself.  The special features carry over the commentaries from the previous release (including the one with film critic Roger Ebert, who called Dark City the best film of 1998), as well as some new featurettes that find Proyas and co. retrospecting about making the film.  As for the film itself, I won't go into story details since you can find them on this page, but let it be said that Dark City is a film you will not forget.  Innvoative for it's time and pre-dating anything The Matrix would do by a year plus, Dark City is a spectacular science fiction feast for the senses.  If you've never seen the film, you are indeed doing yourself a disservice.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A classic Hollywood thriller"></head><body><p>Things have really changed in Hollywood in the last decade.  I can remember back about 7 or 8 years ago, when the thriller/suspense genre was one of the most successful types of movie to make.  When Michael Douglas was in his heyday with films such as Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, A Perfect Murder, and others, those were the days of the Hollywood thriller.  Regretfully, since the genre was so popular, most original ideas have long since been done and redone.  Derailed is one of the best thrillers that I have seen since the "heyday" of Hollywood thrillers.<br /><br />To not give anything away, I will keep the summary to a minimum.  Charles Schine is a mid-level executive at a commercial marketing firm.  He has a strained relationship with his family due to outside, uncontrollable circumstances.  Charles meets Lucinda Harris one day on the train to work, seemingly an act of fate.  Everything is going normally, with Charles and Lucinda about to commit adultery, until they are interrupted by an armed man with extremely bad intentions.  After the initial incident, Charles is sucked into a game with the perp, otherwise known as La Roche, that involves giving away his family's life savings to keep his mistakes a secret.<br /><br />While the movie definitely goes by the classic thriller formula, that, in part, is what makes it so enjoyable.  It does a great job of making you despise the villain, and Clive Owen is great as the sad, yet well-meaning and genuine husband.  Jenifer Aniston gets second billing in the film, but her role takes a back seat to Owen once the bad things start to happen.  Not only does the film do a great job of getting the viewer involved and caring about the main character, but it also makes sure to make the ending as enjoyable as possible.  The addition of a couple of good twists only serves to make the movie better to look back on once you've watched it the first time.  In fact, I would say that the ending of the film makes it worth watching the movie a second time to see what you can catch that might actually clue you in as to what is actually going on.  In short, this movie was a huge surprise to me.  I wasn't expecting too much, but it turned out to be a great throwback to the amazing thrillers of days gone by.</p></body></html>

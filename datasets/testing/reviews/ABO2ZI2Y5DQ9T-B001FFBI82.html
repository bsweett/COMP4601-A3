<meta name="summary" content="War without Battle, Film without Heart: War Film with Very Cynical View on the Marines or Anything"></head><body><p>Sam Mendes' account of the Gulf War, based on the memoirs of the same title, is as hollow and empty as his much overrated `American Beauty.' By the word `hollow' I am not trying to describe its content or story which avoids the clich&eacute;s of the war films. The biggest and fatal flaw is that the sneering attitudes of `Jarhead' about the characters it describes.<br /><br />You don't need any minute summery of the film. It is about one soldier's look on the war, which could be different from the other soldiers', or could be just the same. Though I haven't read the book, it is clear that the film thinks it important to keep the touch of the first-person account of the Gulf War written by former Marine Anthony Swofford. At least I thought so in the first half of the film, which is devoted to the descriptions of the marines' boring and almost aimless life in the desert, just waiting for the war. Well, I have never been in the Marines, but it looks real.<br /><br />But as the film goes on, I started to doubt. I do not hate the film because few things happen in the film (because that is exactly the point of the film). On the contrary, too many things happen in it, all of which attempt to give an emphasis upon the emptiness of the war and the life of the Marines. If marines would hate the film because of the negative images of them with crude and immature behaviors, it is understandable. You would keep thinking, either amused or disguised, "Is this reality?" You never know, because this is after all the first-person account, but the film's real problem lies behind that.<br /><br />In spite of the strong acting (I agree reluctantly) from Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford, the characters in the film look like amalgam of many exaggerated traits of the Marines. Look at Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) the `spotter,' who can keep cool at various trying experiences in the desert, but suddenly blows it at the moment when he is denied one thing - killing. Look at Staff Sgt, Sykes (Jamie Foxx), mouthy stereotype who suddenly speaks (briefly, as usual) of his background before the burning oil well. Mendes means something profound in these scenes, but what we see is typical war film formula that could have been more effectively done with better hands like Samuel Fuller who really went to war. And behind all of the negative images you can see the sneer of the director who really doesn't believe in anything, who doesn't care the characters even if they are based on t the real-life people.<br /><br />But after all, what kind of film, whether it is about war or suburbia, can we expect from Sam Mendes, who is a master of cynicism? It is beautifully shot cynicism, but cynicism never believes in anything good in humans. And it is always afraid of finding some merit in what it is sneering at.</p></body></html>

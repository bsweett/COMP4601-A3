<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely the worst movie!"></head><body><p>I could list a whole string of adjectives, but I don't have even an interest in doing that. Just the bottom line: "Bridesmaids" is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br />Nothing aroused pity or awe. Nothing was redeeming. There was nothing to celebrate. Absolutely nothing made me smile, not even inside and this is supposed to be the Comedy of the Summer. All I can think of is the bride-to-be squatting in the street in her soon-to-be wedding gown and having a diarrheric outburst after eating spoiled food. It was not a funny moment. Or picturing that awful woman slinging her leg on the door post while the air marshall was trying to get to his seat. Or that awful Kristen Wiig destroying the bridal shower decorations and food because she was jealous.<br /><br />The whole movie had the feel of Saturday Night Live to it, not the various old Nights, but the current one that is vulgar and foul beyond belief, lead especially by one of the most obnoxious "comedians" to ever hold sway over the show. I'm sure Phil Hartman is rolling in his grave.<br /><br />The poor Irish actor, who was stuck as Kristen's love interest--I mean, how did he get in there?<br /><br />That's all I care to say about this pitiful movie.</p></body></html>

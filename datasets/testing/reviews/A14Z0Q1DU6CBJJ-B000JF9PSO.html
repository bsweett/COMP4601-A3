<meta name="summary" content="BEST FILM OF THE YEAR"></head><body><p>Why do I think so?<br /><br />There's no Jack Nicholson, no Spielberg, no Peter Jackson, but what it does have is an incredible attention to detail and realism that will have you riveted from beginning to end.<br /><br />Each frame of film captures the heart-breaking moments as the passengers unknowningly board UNITED 93, not unlike any of us would at any occasion, or the hectic job of an air traffic controller and the mistakes that were made, the red tape and numerous hoops that people had to jump through to get things done, all being too late, the insanity that drove the CULTISH Muslim terrorists to murder thousands on that day in the name of GOD, and ultimately the passengers of 93 that realized their fate and did the only thing they could... fight back.<br /><br />UNITED 93 is not to be missed and without question should at least be a nominee for a 2006 Oscar for best picture.<br /><br />The genius of UNITED 93 is that it didn't play like a movie. It's unconventional storytelling method is quite simply, REALISM. The documentary feel. Many of the air traffic controllers and FFA tower operators played themselves, really lending to the realism of the film. The actors didn't play like actors... they are real. They do their jobs and their roles so capably, you don't think you're watching a film. You are watching the real events.<br /><br />Finally, UNITED 93 will pose questions. Like any great film should. Why were the heads of the FAA and the military so slow to react? Why did they doubt when they were told what was going on by a air traffic controller? Why wasn't the government brought into the loop sooner? and finally, how can Muslim men be so brainwashed, that they could believe that GOD, could condone and ask them to MURDER thousands of people who are peaceful, going to work and of many different races (many fellow Muslims) and countries.<br /><br />They have obviously never been to New York City to see how EVERY race, religion, creed and sex is welcomed and has been thriving peacefully for years... together.<br /><br />UNITED 93 is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

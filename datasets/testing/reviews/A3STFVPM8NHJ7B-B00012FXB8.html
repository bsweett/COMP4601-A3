<meta name="summary" content="The greatest box set ever...perhaps"></head><body><p>I purchased this set over three years ago and I never had a problem with it. Then again, I sold it because I never really watched the films. Ive been watching more movies lately and gave this set anther go round. Plus I have a surround sound, so that should be fun. Its probably the greatest box set ever because of the contents. While some movie box sets are good they always seem to forget something. Whether it be a movie because it wasnt made at the studio or extra features, there is always something missing. This set has nothing missing. All four films plus four director cut versions of the films and extra features that i'll probably never see it all in my life. Its a good boxset and it has never been duplicated. I wonder why.</p></body></html>

What starts out a great update of the 'zombie' idea with some end of the world flavor one eighties into something about as terrrifying and engaging as the undead dance sequence from THRILLER.  It's dissapointing really, the film has an darkened look and feel that would've been great given a better script.  A great modern day, realistic survival/zombie film has yet to be made, because this is not it.  Unsympathetic characters are half of the blame and we've seen them before in dozens of genere films.  I hate watching a movie where the players act in a fashion that no human being would behave.  The old cliche where the lone person goes into the dark, creepy room just to look around has been over-overdone.  I understand a film such as this is already stretching the bounds of reality, however can't one be made that's somewhat realistic?  There a plot points-a-plenty that go unexplained, as well as twists that just didn't work, making for a strangely unexpected second half.  On par with RESIDENT EVIL (the movie, not the video game, which is a far better apocalyptic zombie experience than this), which isn't that good itself.  I might have been expecting too much here, but the end result could have been so much more than horror retreads filmed with flair.</p></body></html>

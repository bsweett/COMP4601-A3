<meta name="summary" content="Plot and dialogue can't back up visuals"></head><body><p>It's a world when tomorrow held promises of a bright future. Urban America, 1920 or so, and technology has managed to surpass the technology of 2004 in some ways, but is still charmingly cloaked in the clunky nuts and bolts of Rosie the Riveter. There's a comic book feel as giant robots invade the city, and Jude Law appears in a single-man plane to repel them with machine-gun fire. The plot unfolds to encompass more of the world, and eventually we learn that an evil scientist is gathering animals into a noah's ark, so that he can destroy the earth and make a paradise among the stars. The movie looks cool, with a soft lens filming technique and an all-CGI background that combine to give us a unique feel. But the plot is silly even in the rare instances when it is believable, and the screenplay can't give us any more than a caricature of the era. It succeeds on an "Indiana Jones" kind of level, but I wanted more cleverness to be inserted into both the dialogue and the plot to accompany the technical wizardry.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Say what you will about Tom Cruise, he is a credible actor &"></head><body><p>sometimes makes a good movie. The Last Samurai is. Historical? Hardly. Take a few grains: yes, Samurai existed in Japan as an ancient, militaristic culture, a law unto themselves, & Japan was opening itself up to the west at the time of the movie (1876). Aside from that... Cruise is an emotionally damaged hero of the civil & Indian wars. He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force. Who is the enemy? The Samurai, who are much admired & feared through-out Japan. They refuse to surrender to modernity & give up their way of life. In battle he is captured by the Samurai. Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe. He is impressed by Cruise's fighting skills & spares him. Can you guess the rest? Of course. It's right out of Dances with Wolves but probably less accurate. While a prisoner he adopts the Samurai lifestyle.  Oh the pain, the inner conflict, the over-acting. I said it was a GOOD movie (C+). That's it. The Samurai are doomed, destroyed by time  more than anything else. Well done battle scenes. Lots of really good extras in this two disc set. Cruise is really charismatic & likeable in the extensive interviews he gave. He put a lot of time & effort into this movie. Lots of background & interviews with other principals. They even had The History Channel episode History or Hollywood? about the movie & the "history" behind it. In some ways the extras are better than the movie.</p></body></html>

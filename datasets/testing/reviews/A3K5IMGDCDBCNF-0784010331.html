<meta name="summary" content="&quot;See you at the party Richter.&quot;"></head><body><p>Total Recall is one of those movies I can watch over and over and never get sick of.  It is what every true Arnold fan wants in an Arnold flick.  And aside from being one of Arnold's best films it is a very great sci-fi flick period.<br /><br />Arnold plays everyman Douglas Quaid, a guy living an average life on the near future earth who is obsessed with the idea of going to Mars(which is colonized).  He decides to go to a futuristic company called Recall, which sells it's customers memories of vacations they did not really take.  Quaid decides to do it and while the salesman is making his pitch he poses the question, &quot;what is the same about every vaction you have ever taken?&quot; The answer: You.  So Quaid buys the secret agent package and that is when the action begins.  Suddenly everyone is out to get Quaid and he can't figure it out, all he knows is he has to get his &quot;a** to Mars.&quot;  He does and the film really takes off with mutants, rebels, women, corruption, double crossing, heavy carnage, planet saving, and Arnold, smack in the middle of all of it. <p>The story in summary can actually be found within the movie, which is a very unusual plot device, but it works in this film.  The guy at Recall says by the time this is over you will kill the bad guys, get the girl, and save the planet.  So is Total Recall a dream or a reality.  This question is one of the things that makes it such an engaging movie because you don't know.  Really though the best part of this film is Arnold.  He is in tip top form in this film and it is certainly one of his best.  The character allows him all the elements to shine, odds against him, guys always trying to fight him, lots of guns, and terrific one-liners. Paul Verhoeven(Robocop, Basic Instict) has crafted a awesome film.  The set direction is great and it makes the fantastic action that much better.  Sure Verhoeven may get a little carried away with violent nature of his action, but would anyone really want this film any other way?  Not me.<p>Total Recall is a blast.  On an additional note I just picked up the DVD Collector's Edition and it is a must have for fans.  The commentary with Verhoeven and Arnold is hilarious and the making of's are very well done.  This is one of those films that will become a classic over time because that is what it is, CLASSIC.</p></body></html>

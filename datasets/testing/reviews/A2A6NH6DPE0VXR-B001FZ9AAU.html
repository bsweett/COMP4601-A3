<meta name="summary" content="A Summer Movie That Doesn't Disapoint"></head><body><p>Iron Man is a Marvel Comic movie that doesn't disapoint. It's better than Spiderman 3 "which even Fantastic Four 2 was even more fun than" with more wit and a lot less whining, crying and.... disco dancing. Hell it's the best Marvel movie since Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2. It slowly picks up which is why it gets compared to the Hulk by some people. However it's always entertaining and more fun than the Hulk.<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr's Stark slowly becomes Iron Man but the movie is never boring since Downey carries the film well with his quick wit. It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark. He also has chemestry with Gwyneth Paltrow who has a quick wit of her own here as a trustworthy employee of his. Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend. I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner. When there is action it's super cool and well done. But the movie wouldn't have been as good if Robert Downey Jr. wasn't casted. He's not just funny here but he shows that he can handle playing the heroic type and he does it well.</p></body></html>

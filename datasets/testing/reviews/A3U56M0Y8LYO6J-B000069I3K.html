Angst, disillusion, and loss are such common themes in cinema that it makes one wonder if film is indeed an escapist refuge from the real world or just a mirror of our own sobering existence.  Films that accentuate all that is good in life have been in short supply since the medium first gained widespread commercial appeal.  Only once in a while does a film like "The Wizard of Oz," "It's A Wonderful Life" or "The Sound of Music" come our way to make us feel good about ourselves.  Steven Spielberg's &quot;E.T The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is another such film. <p>A spaceship lands one night and its alien inhabitants disembark in search of plant samples.  When the ship leaves to avoid detection, one of its crew is left behind in the forest.  This lost creature finds refuge at the home of a boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas) and the two of them forge a strong friendship.  When the government tries to seize the alien, Elliott and his supporters foil their plans and escape with the little visitor so that it can rendezvous with its spaceship and return home.  <p>The most fascinating aspect of &quot;E.T The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is how lifelike the alien is.  So convincing are the special effects that we have no trouble accepting the strange little creature as a living being.  The manner in which it interacts with its surroundings and with its supporting human performers is the definition of cinematic magic.  Thomas also deserves his fair share of credit for the film's success.  It is difficult enough to deliver a strong child performance but to do so while acting opposite a mass of puppets and animatronics is especially noteworthy.  &quot;E.T The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is one of those films that celebrates the joy and adventure of childhood.  It is a suburban fairy-tale that will enthrall and delight youngster for generations to come.  It is also a reminder of the tremendous contribution Steven Spielberg has made to American culture in his lifetime.</p></body></html>

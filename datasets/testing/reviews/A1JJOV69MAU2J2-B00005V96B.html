<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful family movie & the best extras ever on DVD..."></head><body><p>The folks at Pixar have really outdone themselves with this joy-filled DVD package, which I was lucky to receive about a month before the official release.<br />If you have not yet seen the movie, have no fear, buy the DVD, do not rent. You will not regret it. Wildly imaginative, totally hilarious and yet filled with deeper meanings and fine acting, Monster's Inc. is first-rate family entertainment that rewards multiple viewings.<br />And like other Pixar pictures, Randy Newman's unique musical talent is a wonderful antidote to the schlock you will find in other companies' animated pictures.<br />As for the 2-disc DVD set, the bonus disc alone is worth the price of admission. Most DVD "deluxe" packages that I have seen to date have a haphazard collection of lame "making of" features, a few deleted scenes and previews. Not with Monsters Inc. This well-thought out disc is packed with fun games, entertaining documentaries on the movie and on the crazy people at Pixar, and the bonus "Mike's New Car" short among the hours of features on this disc. Instead of 90 minutes of movie, you are really getting four or five hours of real entertainment.<p>The director's commentary track is also a well-thought out addition to the disc, not just an annoying throwaway that you will find on other discs. My wife and I really enjoyed the story behind the story, and the fun that the Pixar folks had in making this movie is infectious. <p>I can't recommend this enough.<p>Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will never look at rats the same way again."></head><body><p>Pixar and director Brad Bird hits another one out of the park with an entertaining, funny and even informative take on haute cuisine. Ratatouille combines themes such as a rags to riches story, father and son dynamics, living a double life, and of course rats and food. Pixar has always been good with smart family entertainment and this movie is no different. My four year old son loves it. My 20 year old daughter loves it. I love it. This is one of those films that will undoubtedly endure the test of time.<br /><br />The basic story is a rat with a keen sense of smell and a love for making food gets separated from his family and ends up at the restaurant of his favorite chef. In a strange turn of events Remy (the rat voiced by Patton Oswalt) creates a soup that everybody loves, but credit was given to the garbage boy. Remy and said garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) come up with a plan to keep Remy cooking with Linguini as the cover. From there you get plenty of hijinks, cartoon thrills, a little romance, some character development, and all around fun times.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how good the animation is on a movie. If the script doesn't deliver the movie won't either (just look at Final Fantasy). Ratatouille's is sharp. It hits all the marks in story development and gives a really nice pacing on events. My only gripe is there was an action scene or two that felt forced just to add some excitement while not really lending to the story very well. Other than that the plot was pitch perfect.<br /><br />While a great story is the backbone to a good movie good animation doesn't hurt. I can't really say much that most people who watch Pixar movies already know. The animation excels. The fine details from the hairs on the rats and humans to the look of the food to the stylistic backgrounds. It all shows quality. I can't help think a bit of The Incredibles theory is in the design, which would make sense considering Brad Bird directed that one too.<br /><br />Another thing that can make or break the immersion level of an animated movie is the sound and voice acting. Pixar always finds a way to get the best out of their actors and make them sound like professional voice talents. It's all great, but I would like to make note of my personal standouts. Lou Romano as Linguini gives a ton of character for somebody who doesn't have much of a voice acting background (he's a design artist). I didn't recognize comedian Janeane Garofalo as Colette she was so convincing. More so for Ian Holm as the main villain Skinner. He knocked it out of the park for me with that outlandish character. Then you have Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. This man steals the show with his voice and the subtle intonation in his performance resonates.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is a re-release of the 2007 Blu-Ray with an additional DVD version added. The special features are identical to the previous release. Here's what you get(* denotes feature on the DVD as well):<br /><br />Pixar Shorts*:<br /><br />Lifted - One of my favorite shorts about an alien abduction... final exam. The human character looks a lot like our human hero Linguini from the movie.<br /><br />Your Friend the Rat - This is actually a very educational and informative short on the history of rats and their relationship to human society. It's told by Remy and his brother and is very entertaining.<br /><br />Fine Food & Film* - Interesting featurette with Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller on the food designed for the movie.<br /><br />Cine-Explore - Tons of mini documentaries and interviews can be picked up while watching the movie. Just about everything you wanted to know. I believe you can get this stuff on the main menu as well without using Cine-Explore.<br /><br />Gusteau's Gourmet Game - Never played it. Supposed to be Linguini making food during an increasingly busy meal rush.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes* - Three of them, and they are not finished beyond rough animation. Interesting stuff, but nothing you would have missed.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes R.I.P. - More deleted scenes. I haven't seen them, but I heard they are better than the previous deleted scenes.<br /><br />I am assuming the Easter Eggs are also still in here. Wait for the rat to appear on the main menu and then hit the left directional key. You get five bonus items on an hidden menu.<br /><br />Ratatouille is an amazingly entertaining film and this release has a lot of great extras on top of a great movie. If you have one of those households that has both Blu-Ray players and DVD players (maybe in the kids room) this is a good buy as it keeps both version inside one case. If you are a BD or DVD only household it may be better for you to go for the 2007 release if it's cheaper.</p></body></html>

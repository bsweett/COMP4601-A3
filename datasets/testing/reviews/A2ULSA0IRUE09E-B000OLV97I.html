I don't know whats worse - the blatant rip-offs of "The Lord of the Rings" and "Star Wars" or the very weak casting. And lets not even start on the dialogue.<br /><br />I think the main problem here is the casting. The young boy they selected to play the lead is not at all convincing or a very good actor in any sense of the word. Then there is the strange problem of character and place names. I swear, its as if the writer was so unimaginative that he actually fused together various names from LOTR and Star Wars to create new names for everything here. Pathetic.<br /><br />The dialogue is beyond bad. The language used in the book was pretty pedestrian (at least there was an excuse due to the young age of the author) but for a script to sound so sad is inexcusable. Here are a few gems (read and weep!):<br /><br />"What wisdom can I give people that they haven't already learned? What feats can I achieve that an army couldn't do better? It's insanity!" - by Eragon<br /><br />"My mind is the only sanctuary that has not been stolen from me. Men have tried to breach it before, but I've learned to defend it vigorously, for I am only safe with my innermost thoughts."<br /><br />"Oaths betrayed, souls killed, eggs shattered! Blood everywhere. Murderers!"<br /><br />"You are an enigma, Eragon, a quandary that no one knows how to solve."<br /><br />Add to that the numbing performances of all concerned. To be fair, the dragon special effects were very good, but this has been done better in countless other films.<br /><br />At the end of it, this film gives off a very "cheap" look. It looks like something that was produced for the Sci-Fi Channel but then someone had the sick idea to actually release this to mainstream theaters. Bad idea. No wonder this flopped (as it should have), as it has no redeeming features that I can think of.<br /><br />Not Recommended. You deserve better than to spend your money on this nonsense. And if you're thinking of watching this with your kids, you can do MUCH MUCH better elsewhere, with either "Gormenghast" or "Faerie Tale Theater".</p></body></html>

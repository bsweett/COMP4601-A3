<meta name="summary" content="it takes time to develop that's for sure"></head><body><p>Hostel can best be described like this- the first half of it focuses around nothing but sexual acts involving young college boys in Belgium attempting to score with the very attractive near-supermodel quality women that roam the streets over there (and boy are they ever hot!) and the second half is when the actual horror finally gets underway so we witness some gruesome cutting and chopping involving knives, chainsaws, and sharp blades.<br /><br />Some of the horror is especially disturbing in a mentally screwed up kind of way, especially near the end when the Asian girl gets her eyeball ripped off and yellow mustard drips down her socket.  Later on she realizes while seeing her reflection that she can't go on living in such a way so she then immediately jumps in front of a train and kills herself, shocking all the concerned people around her.<br /><br />The problem is that the first half is so focused on everything *except* horror that it might not be worth the wait for the actual suspense and horror to develop.  It's supposed to be about a twisted man who captures and butchers young people but... the storyline mainly sticks with the college kids and avoids any kind of compelling storytelling.  I admit it was sort of cool how the captured kids would scream and scream and yet, no compassion on the part of the killer would occur.  Oh, and without spoiling the ending, the gruesome, bloody scenes that take place then happen to be exceptionally low budget.  Not sure if others would agree.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad horror flick by any means, and I admit that because the women were so attractive I didn't mind the first half of the film at all, but those looking strictly for horror will be disappointed with the lengthy waiting period.</p></body></html>

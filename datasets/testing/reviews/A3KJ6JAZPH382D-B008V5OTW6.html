We want them all dead."></head><body><p>The opening sequence of "Munich" relies heavily on ABC news footage about the murders of Israeli Olympic athletes in 1972. They are the most frightening and harrowing things about this movie, if only because we know that this particular nightmare really did happen. What came after, as documented in the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743291646">Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team</a>," was that the Israeli government decided to covertly kill the men they had identified as having a hand in the Black September assassinations.<br /><br />From there, "Munich" plods and meanders, striking a poor balance between the dreadful acts of Black September with the emotional/psychological state of Avner (Eric Bana, excellent here) and his cohorts. The dramatizations of the revenge killing do overstate what really happened - according to the book - and a very important endpoint is omitted. Avner is unceremoniously dumped by his employers once he backs away from this assignment; no money, no identity and no proof about what he did. It makes the final blathering about "The Cycle of Violence" ring a little false as Steven Spielberg pulls away from Avner and Ephrain (Geoffrey Rush, also well done in a creepy way) to expose the World Trade Center. "Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values," intones Golda Mier as she issues the order to send assassins after the murders. Yet the questions begin to creep in over and over as the Black September organizers fall and are replaced...and Avner discovers that he and maybe his family have become the hunted...where does it end? Avner begins to pull away, bemoaning "Every man we've killed has been replaced by worse!"<br /><br />Other than the politics of the movie and the personal conflicts - there is a lot of talk about what it means to be a Jew and losing/keeping your soul - "Munich" is supposed to come off as a suspenseful spy flick. The passages between events are too long, the transitions too uncertain, however to maintain that suspense. The drawn out ending adds nothing to the movie, either. Reportedly edited on the fly with shots finalized within two days of shooting in some cases, one wonders what a little more time spent on a judicious edit might have accomplished. Tony Kushner's script is a stilted mess of pretensions and really could have been trimmed back.<br /><br />It leaves "Munich" as a movie with such potential to tell a story and offer a moral lesson trapped in a moribund film. Speilberg's breif explaining his motivations for "Munich" and wanting not to make a statement about Israel's morality but about the "unintended consequences" of violence at the begining of the DVD actually say more about the movie than the movie does! The horrors of Munich 1972 should not be forgotten, but this isn't the movie that captures why.</p></body></html>

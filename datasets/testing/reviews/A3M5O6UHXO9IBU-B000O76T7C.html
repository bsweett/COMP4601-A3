This despite the fact that the crew never does anything remotely knock-off-able. Well, they do accuse engineer Brett of being a parrot. "KNOCK IT OFF! KNOCK IT OFF!!!!" Yells Dallas and flings himself around the space cabin in apoplexy. Goodness, isn't he getting enough? Sleep, I mean. Apart from months in hypersleep, of course. "Thrill me" Dallas then sneers at crewman Lambert. I wish she would. Anything to cheer the shabby old misanthrope up. He's about as much fun as finding yourself trapped in a lift with a carnivorous alien life form. Which, curiously enough, sums up the plot. But the alien has not reared it's ugly head yet, so why is Dallas making with the negative waves all the time? Upping the ante, he tells Parker that he doesn't want to see any heroics out of him. But he hasn't so far as Parker didn't even want to land on the ruddy planet in the first place. Unlike Dallas, who couldn't wait to get down to the surface. It's such a miserable place, who better than Dallas to acquire real estate at drop down prices? Dallas then abdicates his captain's duty of plunging the crew into a state of clinical depression every twelve minutes by going into the shuttle to listen to classical music. Will the crew lock him in for the duration? Knock it off. When the alien does finally appear, Dallas treats it as an annoying distraction from his life long mission to be as grouchy as possible with a loud beard. So he announces to the crew that he intends to go into the duct to tell the alien to knock it off. Curiously, nobody objects.<p>Ridley Scott does the commentary. I wish he'd knock it off. For instance, he suggests Ash's odd reaction to Ripley's assault on him was due to the fact that he'd never seen anyone cry before. What about Lambert in the previous scene? Mr Scott, I don't want to see any heroics out of you. In future, just thrill me, will ya?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An under-rated masterpiece"></head><body><p>A compelling tale of power, money and depravity sets the tone for this riveting crime drama. Casino has always been compared to Goodfellas and indeed one of the few variations is that this film is set in the heart of Las Vegas but the film holds enough merits to make it distinctley unique within itself and deserves to be judged on such. Robert De Niro heads the excellent cast, playing Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a master bookie turned big-shot casino manager who's astute head for business quickly deserts him when he marries ex-hooker Ginger McKenna (played convincingly by Sharon Stone). Sams boyhood acquaintance, Nicky Santoro (a superb turn from Joe Pesci) turns up with an ambitious agenda of his own thing that takes things on a further downward spiral.<br />Casino was written by Nicholas Pileggi (who received an oscar nomination for Goodfellas) who goes for absorbing realism, expertly drawn characters that are played with raw, instinctive conviction and a host of intriguing subplots. There are plenty of stomach-churning scenes of violence with such graphic images of a victims head being squeezed in a vice being one of the most brutal acts displayed in the film. The films well-thought out structure is accompanied by an enthralling and sizzling soundtrack. A genuine masterpiece!</p></body></html>

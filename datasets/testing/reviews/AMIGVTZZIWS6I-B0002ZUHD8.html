<meta name="summary" content="Braveheart meet Excalibur"></head><body><p>This film tries so hard to bring a sort of historical "accuracy" to the legend of King Arthur that it loses much of the wonder, excitement, and romance of Arthurian Legend.  No, I was not expecting a Mists of Avalon fantasy, but I also was not expecting this violent tour of the Dark Ages.  Now, I've never seen the the PG-13 version so I don't know if the violence was toned down (I expect it would have had to been less to get a PG-13), but the violence in this film is a bit much at times and with the blue-painted Celts it was like a British version of Braveheart.  At one point there is even a big speech reminiscent of Mel Gibson's freedom speech in Braveheart.  If Clive Owen had uttered "For Freedom!" I would not have been surprised.  The major positive of this film are the actors. Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, and Keira Knightley are good considering the material they are forced to recite.  Ioan Gruffudd, in particular, was very good.  I look forward to seeing him in the Fantastic Four.  Overall, this film suffers from trying to remove the fantastical elements that have allowed the legend of King to endure for more than a 1,000 years.  Give me Excalibur, John Boorman's classic retelling, any day.</p></body></html>

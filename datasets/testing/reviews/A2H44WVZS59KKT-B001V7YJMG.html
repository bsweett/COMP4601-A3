I thought the casting for the U.S. film was superb.  I liked Eli (although not as much as Abby) in the Swedish version but Oskar, with his nose running all the time, I could not stand.<br /><br />I thought Eli's eyes were great.  I liked the scene with the crane taking the body ice cube out of the frozen lake.  I liked the acid burns better.  But, all in all, I much preferred the U.S. version.<br /><br />Both versions (and this one gets the major kudos since it was the original) are unique, very frightening, have well-done cinematography and did I say they were scary?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, poor DVD"></head><body><p>Nia Vardalos is a veteran comedienne from the Second City group in Chicago.  This film is a catharsis of sorts, as only a gifted comedienne can present: growing up as one of the few Greek girls in Winnepeg, surrounded by blonde Anglos and Ukrainians, she undoubtedly felt left out and turned to comedy to be accepted.<p>This film is beautifully performed and written.  Vardalos herself plays the heroine, Toula, who is painfully shy and somewhat downtrodden, living in the shadow of an older, &quot;perfect sister.&quot;  When she decides to make something of herself - by going to college and specialising in &quot;Computers in the Travel Industry,&quot; she is noticed by a typical white-bread American, Ian Miller.  The movie follows their courtship with special emphasis on the contrast between Toula's Greek and Ian's WASP families.  Of course, since this is a comedy, everything is exaggerated - Ian's parents are stiff and reserved to a fault, while Toula's house is filled with 50 relatives at any given time.  There is also some fun inter-generational humour, as Toula (and her brother) try to break free of the old-world mold of their parents.  Some of the funniest moments are Toula's father lamenting that her over-education led her astray (i.e. into the arms of a non-Greek).<p>Although such a description implies there is an undercurrent of racism (or, at least, ethnic chauvenism), the movie is never mean-spirited.  In fact, it's almost naive in its good-naturedness, in that everyone ends up getting along and the two families come together wonderfully.  If only real life were as life-affirming as this film!  It is family film in that it is funny, warm-hearted, and contains no unsuitable material, although I suspect younger children will find the plot boring and not get most of the jokes.<p>Unfortunately, this DVD version is not up to the standards of the film.  The commentary, mostly by Vardalos, is interesting and points out a number of true-to-life events that were incorporated into the film, in addition to pointing out various friends and family members that appear in the film.  However, there are no cut scenes, no documentaries, etc.  Worse still, there are something like 7 ads for other movies at the beginning of the film, that you have to manually skip - this is a sure-fire way to anger your audience before the film even starts.  Finally, on top of all that, the box promises both widescreen and pan-and-scan, but the disc I saw only seems to have P&amp;S, which I hate.  You only get to see 2/3 of the movie that way!</p></body></html>

Since the dawn of human civilization when cavemen drew on walls to showcase fantastic, possibly even exaggerated, achievements of the people of the era, man has sought to express stories of ?heroes?, whether they be true or legendary, through the use of pictures so that other people in their travels through the land would know of that person?s great achievements and spread them throughout the tribes. In the centuries that would follow, this method of communication would be passed down to the ancient Egyptians who would develop the pictorial language which they would use the walls of their temples to tell the legends of their gods and their deceased rulers. Even to this very day this language art form can be found in the average comic-book shop but the surge of comic-book franchises quickly being adapted to the big screen can lead to its demise, with more interested in the aspect of profits rather then the messages their art expresses.<br /><br />The story centers on a man whose survival from a tragic train accident begins to unravel a mystery into who he actually is and what he was destined to do with his life. While on a train ride from New York, which he had gone to seeking a higher-profile security position, to his home town of Philadelphia, David Dunne contemplates on his life and wonders why he has this inscrutable feeling of sadness, one of which he finds himself with each and every day of his life ever since a near-fatal car accident years ago brought a direct halt to his college football career. With a flash, David finds himself lying on a bed within a hospital with no clear understanding of how he got there. After receiving strange looks from doctors and nurses checking in on him, David discovers that he is the lone survivor of a tragic train accident that took the lives of one hundred and thirty-one people. Not only that but after careful examination there appears to be not a single scratch, bruise, or mark on David?s body. David begins to fall deeper into seclusion and sadness contemplating on why he alone survived the train accident but so many more fortunate innocents did not. Why was he special? After attending a memorial offered to those who died in train accident, David discovers a note on the windshield of his car that asks the question, ?How many days of your life have you been sick?? After meeting with the mysterious Elijah Price, who Dunne first dismisses as a man who?s sickness (low protein that makes he?s bones easily breakable) has taken over his sanity, David takes the opportunity his survival from the train accident has given him to patch up the relationship with his wife and son. But the more David puts off the eccentric comic-book curator, Elijah Price, the more the truth behind the great mysteries of his life is revealed to him, in that the David may be one of the great ?superheroes? Elijah?s comic books once harkened about. The story for Unbreakable may not have had quite the impact director/writer M. Night Shyamalan had been hoping for in its initial release and that may be attributed to the fact that it was created well before its proper time. For those who witness the magnificence of this film will find its thought-provoking concepts of heroes and villains, both in the comic-book world and how those are reflected in every day life, absolutely chilling, more so when one factors in the film?s pre-9/11 release.<br /><br />As with most M. Night Shyamalan films, the cast of Unbreakable, namely those who?s screen time consisted of more then a mere cameo in the film?s nearly two hour timeframe, is remarkably limited with the course of the film?s story centralized on the actions of two characters that of Bruce Willis? David Dunne and Samuel L. Jackson?s Elijah Price. Bruce Willis? performance is nothing short of spectacular but even that heap of praise may be selling his role short. In essence, Willis takes on the type of role his co-star in The Sixth Sense, Haley Joel Osment, dealt with, that being a character that is so sensationally challenging and complex that only the most talented of actors can pull off the role. Not only does Willis have the play the role of the victim early on in the film but he has to seamlessly transition from that aspect to that of the rising hero by the film?s end, which not easy to do in any film and even more difficult with a script as intricate as Shyamalan?s. Samuel L. Jackson does a magnificent job in the role of Elijah Price, the mysterious comic-book artwork curator who uses his knowledge of the comic-book universe to reveal to David Dunne his true identity. The reason his role works as well as it does is the way both Willis and Jackson play off each other and how the character, while in the process of helping Dunne realize who he is, hints at the secret identity he has held back from everyone including himself. The only complaint came from Robin Wright Penn?s role as the wife of David Dunne, none of which concerned her particular portrayal of the character but rather the way she was scripted. Either she?s too whiny or she?s sitting idly in the background contributing nothing to move the story along. If were given more to do or she had a greater impact on who David Dunne will become by the end of the film, we would care more about her character but that doesn?t exist in the film audiences are seeing now.<br /><br />Overall, Unbreakable was greatly underappreciated at the time of its late 2000 release but since then the traumatic events that occurred on September 11th, 2001, as well as the realization that America is, and has been, in a war to combat terrorism, not only in our country but abroad, have made this film of greater significance to see in this time of our nation?s history. Triggered by those events, Americans have awakened to the truth, much in the same way David Dunne did, that ?there are extraordinary things inside themselves, as well as others? and we need not look far and wide to find ?supermen? when they live amongst us in our daily lives. Shyamalan demonstrates an increasing sense of maturity both in the script?s sophisticated dialogue as well as in the style in which he sets the complex group of characters. The rising director never ceases to amaze his audiences with the haunting atmospheres in which he set his films and the driving messages he invokes within in each and every one of them. All that can be said about this film is that it the Shyamalan?s best film to date, though Signs does come pretty closes to matching up with it based on overall satisfaction and quality. For those who have been significantly effected by the events of September 11th, whether you be a family member of a victim or simply another average American horrified watching the aftermath, Unbreakable the definitive film to raise your hopes and show to you that there are ?heroes? all around us, some whom need only to know it within themselves for that ?hero? aspect to find its way through their actions.</p></body></html>

A great film reminiscent of Doc Hollywood, but done nascar style. Lightning Mcqueen is a hot shot rookie racer who gets stranded in a small town after getting scared and tearing up main street after a string of missunderstandings.  After being forced to stay and fix his damange, he grows to like the quaint settings, and it's inhabitents, including the Tow Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy.  A tale of Love, Friendship, Loyalty, betrayal, and trust.  It has it all.  For the kids, yes... no worse than what bugs bunny used to have in it.  Buy this, You will like it!!!!</p></body></html>

Well, maybe; I'd certainly put it in the running for that title.<br /><br />Gene Wilder is young Victor Frankenstein, who goes to the length of changing the pronunciation of his name ("Frahnk-en-steen") in an attempt to distance himself from his notorious grandfather. But when he inherits the Frankenstein spooky old castle in Transylvania ("Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?"), he soon falls under the spell of the violin music, the spider-webbed equipment, and the notebooks of his grandfather, carefully preserved by his grandfather's former lover (played to perfection by Cloris Leachman, the horses whinny in fright every time her name is mentioned). He also has the grandson of his grandfather's assistant Igor (That's "Eye-gore" he says, after Frankenstein corrects him on the pronunciation of his name), and a "lab assistant" named Inga, played by Teri Garr. ("Goodness, what knockers!")<br /><br />He left his devoted fiance back in the city (Madeline Kahn), but she eventually shows up at the castle.<br /><br />Of course they manage to reanimate a monster similar to his grandfather's, except this one has a zipper in his neck. He's played by Peter Boyle, who dutifully goes through many of the cliche scenes from the original Boris Karloff rendition, turning each one on its head. My absolute favorite is the blind hermit who so thoughtfully offers him soup, wine and a cigar.<br /><br />There are so many inspired twists to this movie that I'd hate to ruin any of them for you. But I'm betting you will never again be able to hear the song, "Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life" without getting slightly hysterical.</p></body></html>

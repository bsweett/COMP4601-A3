Washington plays Creasy, a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption. He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past. It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed. With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before. But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does. Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose "La Hermanidad" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.<br /><br />Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, "Man on Fire," astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.  Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. While the two leads carry the film, there are only mediocre performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini.  "Man on Fire" is saved by Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.<br /><br />'Man on Fire' had potential to be an outstanding film, being based on a great novel but Scott and Helgeland ultimately cut short on the relationship in order for action. Dizzying, MTV-like editing is used for many of the action scene and it feels as if Scott is trying to emulate both his brother, Ridley and filmmaker Oliver Stone. In 1994 Stone released "Natural Born Killers" which used aesthetics as a focal point to the narrative of the film including some hyper-real scenes. Scott seemed to favor using a similar technique in "Man on Fire" however the negatives outweigh the positives. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is at once ferocious, especially considering his work on films like 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Swordfish'. Christian Wagner (True Romance, Mission: Impossible II) edits with the same kind of speed but instead of adding to the film it also subtracts. The action scenes feel unnecessarily disruptive and it's when the violence on screen happens that Scott actually gains momentum. These scenes last more in the memory than the relationship. Helgeland's script dramatically makes cuts to the novel, and frankly it's uncertain that he even read it! Characters are made into two-dimensional pawns, the setting is changed from Italy to Mexico City, and whole chapters of character development are swiftly cut.  In the end 'Man on Fire' gives into the typical formula. The visuals can be arresting, the action is entertaining, and the leads are worthwhile but the mess created by the filmmakers ultimately drags it down.</p></body></html>

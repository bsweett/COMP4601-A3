He seems to take his characters and their development quite a bit more serious than in his previous effort.  I actually felt some attachment to Jay Hernandez' character once he realizes what's happening in this tale.  With that said, however, I wouldn't rank "Hostel" among the top thrillers or horror flicks in the genre.<br /><br />First off, just having a lot of gore and blood pumped on to the screen doesn't make a film scary.  Many of today's horror fanatics seem to believe that, but those are the same people who cut their teeth on "horror" like the "Scream" series and the later, lesser "Friday The 13th" and "Halloween" sequels.  Introduce these same people to films such as the original and remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and they'll get a little better dose of terror.  These films actually had terror and suspense in them coupled with the gore.  In my opinion, gore is nothing more than icing on the cake.  I've seen plenty of gory films that weren't even as scary as "Jurassic Park."<br /><br />Another thing that drops "Hostel" down a notch is that it lacks a true hero or heroine in the story.  Sure, Hernandez does attempt to save a fellow torture victim, but before all of this his a typical, American butthole.  You know these types of people, they believe that the world is their oyster and mommy and daddy will always be there to bail them out.  Though Hernandez' character does sort of capture me in the end, he just isn't a likeable enough character who I'd want to cheer on.  In fact, his friend played by Derek Richardson is a more likeable guy.<br /><br />Some of the finer points of this flick include the fact that there is no one bad guy.  The baddies are folks wealthy enough to pay to torture and kill someone for their own pleasure.  None of these characters are of the enjoyable type.  One of the sickest sequences in the film isn't someone being dismembered, but it's the interaction between Hernandez and a soon-to-be torturer describing how great the rush is of offing somebody.  The guy has no remorse or concern in his eye, just the urge to feed his addiction.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how Roth constantly tipped off the viewer of the impending doom for the primary characters.  Slight looks to each other, creepy train passengers, and even the gloominess of Slovakia all pose as wonderful harbingers of what is to come.<br /><br />In the end, we have a solid attempt by Roth to seek out the bowels of mankind.  He almost attains it, but focuses too much on gore and leaves the solid and potentially great plotline to drown in a pool of its own blood.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of the gore genre and Roth's first flick, "Cabin Fever."</p></body></html>

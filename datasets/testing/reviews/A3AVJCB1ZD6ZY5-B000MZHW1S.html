That includes ivory, rubber, gold--and now, diamonds.<br /><br />This is Africa.<br /><br />Press gangs of rebels conscripting men at gunpoint, taking them away from their families and forcing them to work mining for diamonds.<br /><br />Rebels handing guns to young children and turning them into soldiers.<br /><br />Young women selling their bodies on the street assuring the customer they are free of HIV.<br /><br />Diamonds being sold by rebels to finance wars to overturn the government.<br /><br />The governments only staying in power long enough to rob the treasuries and then going into exile elsewhere.<br /><br />Mercenaries playing both sides of the fence.<br /><br />Diamond companies tacitly financing the war by buying 'blood diamonds' from rebels, then storing the diamonds to limit their supply so their profits are still high.<br /><br />This is not just the story of one mercenary and Sierra Leone native's quest to retrieve and sell a large carat pink diamond.  It's the history of a country.<br /><br />The story's hard to watch, but very real and worthwhile.  James Newton Howard does an amazing job with the soundtrack, which touches the scene in just the right way to emphasize the director's point.</p></body></html>

A few people have noted the strong sexual content in the film, and to them I say "read the back of the disc"...it clearly states `Rated R for strong sexual content and language' so don't complain about what you already knew.  If that sort of thing offends you then you shouldn't have rented the movie.<br /><br />That off my chest, this film, as I mentioned, is saved from being forgettable by a brilliantly funny and heartwarming script that couldn't have been better executed.  The charm and wit of the film come from none other than our pair of stars, Pierce Bosnan and Greg Kinnear, who couldn't have been better suited for the task.  The two actors play off each other with such genuine warmth and such natural comfortableness that you never see Greg and Pierce but only Danny (Kinnear) and Julian (Bosnan).<br /><br />The film opens with Julian finishing a job.  Julian is a `facilitator of fatalities' or in human terms a hitman, working for corporate businesses and killing for lots of money, making certain people disappear to help business deals go through.  Julian is a crude, rude, perverted, horny, (I think somewhat bi-sexual) man who hasn't a friend in the world, but an address book full of acquaintances.  He has a boss (Philip Baker Hall) who views him as expendable and a personality that usually pushes others far away.  That was until he met Danny, a struggling salesman who's in Mexico on business the same time as Julian.  They meet by chance in a bar, and after a few uncomfortable moments (Julian makes a pass at Danny which is downright hilarious) and a few kind words, the two part ways on not so nice terms.  Over the course of the weekend though the two do become friends and share a secret that ensures their permanent friendship.<br /><br />Six months later Julian shows up on Danny's doorstep.  Danny's wife Bean (Hope Davis) is both mortified and curious of their new houseguest, but it's not Bean Julian is interested in.  You see Julian has screwed up.  He's burnt himself out and botched a few jobs and now his agency wants him dead.  There's just one catch.  If he completes one last job he's off, clean and clear.  But he can't do this alone.  He needs Danny's help.<br /><br />And that's all I'm going to tell you.  You're better off watching the rest to find out for yourself how it all goes.  It's funny and touching and entertaining til the very end.  Pierce Brosnan was snubbed royally at the Oscar's this year for his portrayal of the lonely, desperate, over worked and under loved Julian is priceless and a masterclass of acting talent, and Greg is really starting to prove that his nomination in '97 was not a mere fluke but that he really did deserve it.  Great movie from start to finish so check it out...if it won't offend you!</p></body></html>

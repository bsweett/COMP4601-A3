<meta name="summary" content="A must have!"></head><body><p>This is a fabulous boxed set, especially if you can get it at a decent price. It is available on-line and in some shops at very comptetitive prices.<br /><br />Alien and Aliens are already classics (as everybody knows) and merit repeated viewings.<br /><br />The 3rd and 4th are not up to the same standard but have their moments.<br /><br />There are 9 DVD's in total.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains both versions of Alien + Commentaries<br /><br />Disc 2 contains documentaries on Alien<br /><br />Disc 3 contains both versions of Aliens + Commentaries<br /><br />Disc 4 contains documentaries on Aliens<br /><br />I have watched these and they are very good. Especially in relation to creating the special effects and James Cameron working in the UK at Pinewood (there were problems - indeed almost a strike!).<br /><br />Disc 5 contains both versions of Alien3 + Commentaries<br /><br />Disc 6 contains documentaries on Alien3<br /><br />I have watched some of this and there is some fascinating information on the original script and director.<br /><br />Disc 7 contains both versions of Alien Resurrection + Commentary<br /><br />Disc 8 contains documentaries on Alien Resurrection<br /><br />Disc 9 More Extras<br /><br />All in all a superb set to get.</p></body></html>

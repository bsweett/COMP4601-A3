<meta name="summary" content="VERY NOIR"></head><body><p>This is a unique film, it's dark even by director-writer Fincher's standards.  It's a great movie, but you feel like you need to shower after seeing it.  The ending is of course infamous, but the film is so much more than the ending, and Freeman as always is great, as for Pitt, well I'm not a fan, but he works in this film.  Fincher has a thing for deep noir and this is dark, if you like suspenseful thrillers then you will really like this film, but not for the squeamish I assure you.</p></body></html>

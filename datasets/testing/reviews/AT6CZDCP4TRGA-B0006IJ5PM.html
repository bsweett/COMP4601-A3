<meta name="summary" content="Very good, but could've been great..."></head><body><p>...if it hadn't pulled its punches: I pretty much have to agree with the review in Salon.com (which you can find at rottentomatoes.com), this film is brilliantly shot and acted, but the director cops out halfway through and turns it into just another sports-as-character-formation cliche.<br /><br />The first half of the film touches on some uncomfortable truths about high school (and collegiate) football: that too many people, esp. in tiny backwater towns where nothing else ever happens, live vicariously through them and therefore place an ungodly and uhealthy amount of pressure on the kids playing it.  That these types of towns and schools have their priorities ass-backwards when they funnel all of their resources into their sports programs and exorbitant stadiums rather than education, which shortchanges the other 95% of the students who DON'T play sports.  That these teenage gladiators get put on a social pedestal but often end up getting the short end of the stick because they are given a free ride through school and therefore get very little real education, i.e. very little real-life job prospects if they fail (as 99% do) to make it into the NFL.  The clincher is the ending credits when there are little blurbs about what each player ended up doing later in life---the sensational star running back (aptly nicknamed "Boobie") is vaguely listed as "now living in Somesuch Small Town in Texas with his two kids" instead of describing what sort of menial job he likely ended up with whereas all his other teammates' blurbs do include their job descriptions.<br /><br />However, if you can detach yourself from those painfully obvious realities and evasions, this is still a very entertaining film, better than any other football film I can remember.<br /><br />This film could've been a scathing and courageous indictment of the cult of spectator sports; instead it settles on being just another validation of that toxic subculture.</p></body></html>

I like the action!  I like the drama!  I like the bonding between Denzel and Dakota characters.  "I'm the Lost Sheep that got away" "You think God will forgive us for the things we've done?"  I like this movie and how it should "there's no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends."  Its a good movie!  My life for my friends life so that they can live.  The Swimming was touching!  The screams of a the little girl shouting for the Bodyguard was almost realistic!  I was at the edge my seat.  "It's between God and them, its my job to arrange the meeting!!!!" I like this movie and its a must OWN!!!! BUY!!! IT!!</p></body></html>

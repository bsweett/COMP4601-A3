<meta name="summary" content="The Sequel to "Desperado""></head><body><p>This sequel to Desperado is absolutely great. Antonio Banderas plays the outstanding role of a man with great respect for life and love, yet troubled by memories and a thirst for vengance that curdles within his soul. There are several extraordinary twists with pretty boy Enrique Iglesias and nonchalant Johnny Depp, but this is definitely a great action/drama film. Once you watch it, you'll want to buy it. And if you do buy it, get the Superbit Edition DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Remake!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Having seen all the Amityville Horror movies, I believe that this is the best one ever made. The original was a Good movie for being a older movie but this updated version brings us alot more. The house used in this movie is awesome. The movie begins with us seeing what really happened many years ago in the Defeo home. We see William Defeo shot to death every member of his family while they lay in their beds. What makes this movie even more great, is that actual footage from the real event is used in this film.... from police footage to the actual family members laying dead in a pool of blood in their beds. This movie, like the first shows the Lutz family move into the Defeo home because they get such a good buy on the home. Little do they know what lies ahead. This movie is excellently casted with great special effects. It is truly a edge of your seat movie. A thrilling and suspenseful remake. We see a once happy family start to fall apart as the home takes it's toll on George as he begins turning on his family. Mrs. Lutz realizes that when George is away from the home, he feels and looks much better than when he is in the home. She does research on the home and finds out that many years ago, a man named Katchum used the basement of the home as a torture chamber. After seeing this, she realizes that they must leave the home before the home destroys the entire family. Great from beginning to end. There are no dull or disappointing moments in this film. Truly one to own!</p></body></html>

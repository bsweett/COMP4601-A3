The Black Dahlia is the kind of 2 hour movie you wanna see when you have trouble falling asleep but need to watch moving objects on a television screen.  There was no suspense in this crime drama, and honestly, the best part of the film was the boxing segments in the beginning of the film which truly showed some graphic violence and excitement.  Otherwise, I was totally bored and recommend avoiding this movie at ALL costs.  The only thing nice about the film was the scenery presentatation which truly looked like something from the 1940's.  The suspense came in the way of slowly-moving scenes that bordered on old-fashioned romance segments and soft-soften romance bits.  Yuck.  A film you need to NEVER watch under any circumstances.</p></body></html>

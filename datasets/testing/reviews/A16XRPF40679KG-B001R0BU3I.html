<meta name="summary" content="well made espionage thriller"></head><body><p>This movie is a very thoughtful and well made espionage thriller that in the past would fit in with infiltrating Communists or drug gangs , Nazi's or whoever.  The story is a old one  in that regard , as the infiltrator begans to care about the some of the people he is now accepted as part of their organization. Like any undercover person the job is a rough one that takes a terrible toll on the infiltrator. Don Cheadle also gives a near perfect perfomance as the lead character and one can only hope that someday he gets the right role to land him a Oscar.  The supporting cast is excellent as well  and this is a A list movie with A list talent all the way. What makes this story interesting as well is the focus on the decent Muslims who feel that terrorists have hijacked their religion and then fight back against them. Sadly there are too many silent voices in that regard accross the world.  Like most modern movies this movie just shines on blu ray, there isn't a line or smudge in site.  Blu ray equals classy transfers and top notch sound.  So this very well acted terrorist espionage thriller is well worth a watch especially on blu ray.</p></body></html>

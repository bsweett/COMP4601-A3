<meta name="summary" content="EMINENTLY WATCHABLE, IF ONLY FOR ALIENS IN EGYPT"></head><body><p>Fantastic story of intergalactic travel that's certainly a worthy rental. Imagine a cross between the Twilight Zone and The Ten Commandments spruced up with laser guns and bazookas. Mili Avital is quite the bomb as Sha'uri. Keep an eye out for Horus (Djimon Hounsou), none other than Cinque from 'Amistad.' Russel and Spader need little applause, they go about their business with a single-minded devotion. Don't expect E.T. type wonder and awe at every alternate pace, the whole extravaganza is fast-paced and compulsively watchable in a way that only a foolhardy scifi movie can be. Highly recommended for people looking for some action.</p></body></html>

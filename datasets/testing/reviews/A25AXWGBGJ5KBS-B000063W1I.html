It just makes what's already there look a little nicer.<br />OK...'way nicer. This DVD looks crisp and fresh, with bright colors and gobs of detail.<br />E.T. was the pre-eminent filmgoing event for a generation, the group after &quot;Star Wars&quot;.<br />And with good reason. It's a perfect film.  It hasn't aged a bit. Or I should say it's aging ridiculously well. Or is it &quot;ageless&quot;?  Whatever. You get the point.<br />In fifty years, this film will be as beloved as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;...or as any Disney flick...<br />Henry Thomas puts on a performance that ranks with ANY ever delivered by a child actor, and it is his believability that make ET real to US. I find myself getting all choked up over this rubber blobby thing with a red flashlight in it's chest, and it's all Mr. Thomas' fault.<br />Mr. Spielberg probably has a little to do with it as well.<br />Drew Barrymore has phenomenal comedic timing in this movie, whether that's through the magic of editing or coaching or what. But after nearly every line of hers, I busted out laughing.<br />No matter how many times I see this movie...last night being the first time in a few years...it still &quot;gets&quot; me. And I'm not easily &quot;gotten.&quot; Hardly ever. Maybe twice, in literally thousands of movies.<br />This is one.</p></body></html>

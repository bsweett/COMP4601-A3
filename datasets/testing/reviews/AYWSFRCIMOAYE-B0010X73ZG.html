<meta name="summary" content="The BEST Horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novel."></head><body><p>This movie is the BEST Horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. The special effects are lively. The plot is suspenseful and full of twists. The acting is good.<br /><br />What I like the most is it REALISTICALLY deals with ORDINARY PEOPLE'S psychology. For example, when it was clear anybody who left the supermarket would be killed, a lady asked "Who wants to escort me to my car? I need to pick up my children from home". All the men and women would not help her. It emphasized the fact that when death is lurking around, everybody is for himself.<br /><br />From my interpretation, this film also conveys a message that "When human beings play God, the consequences are extremely unbearable."<br /><br />**** Warning. SPOILERS. Please do not read the comments below if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie. ****<br /><br />There are two situations that back up the message above. First, the military experiments opened the window to the other world. That was when  the monsters came to town.<br /><br />Secondly, at the end, the male character took the matters in to his own hand. Instead of letting other people decide their fate, he made decision for them. It turned out to be more disastrous than it should.<br /><br />This mvie is on my list of BEST HORROR MOVIES of All Time.</p></body></html>

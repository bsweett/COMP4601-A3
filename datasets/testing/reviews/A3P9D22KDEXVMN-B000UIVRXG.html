<meta name="summary" content="Hot Fuzz is Hot!"></head><body><p>Hot Fuzz is very funny, with some excellent action scenes.  Simon Pegg is just hilarious, and he has a great chemistry with the other actors, especially Nick Frost.  The English humor - or should I say humour - is fast and furious in this movie.  The Sleepy Hollow of a town and its excellent scenery are an unusual location for the fast moving criminal activity that follows.  Not for kids with its R rating, there is plenty of violence and off color jokes.  A 4-star thrill ride with laugh after laugh.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very fine remake!"></head><body><p>On august 18th 1973, a group of young adults are traveling on a summer drive in Texas picking up a hithchiker who just commited suicide in their van, they decide to seek help at a old farmhouse. However they discover something shocking, that it's a deathtrap with a demented cannibal family including "Leatherface" ( Andrew Bryniarsky)and a insane sheriff ( R. Lee Ermy) who wants them all dead and for supper.<br /><br />Fine remake of the 1974 horror classic even though it wasn't broken and didn't need to be fixed! when i first heard that there was a going to be a remake instead of a sequel to the Tobe Hooper classic, i was outtraged with the other fans but it turned out to be a nasty suprise even though it's not as good as the remake of "Dawn of the Dead". There's plenty of torture, gore, good camerawork, decent acting, and shocks abound even though it doesn't hold a punch or candle to the original classic but as good as that one and of course part 2 with Dennis Hopper and part 3.<br /><br />This 2-disc DVD is jammed with extras like commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, alternate ending & openeing, screen tests, trailers and TV spots, music video, and galleries including trailers to other New Line movies.<br /><br />A nice addition to your horror collection or if you like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series!</p></body></html>

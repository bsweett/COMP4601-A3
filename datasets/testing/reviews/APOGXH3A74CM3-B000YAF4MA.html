<meta name="summary" content="A thoughtful comedy"></head><body><p>Comedy works best when there's a grain of truth to it, and when it's provocative.  We get both here.  Taking on the topics of cancer and death isn't easy under any circumstances, let along trying to make a compelling movie out of them.<br /><br />And yet, that's what we have here.  A serious and lighthearted film all rolled into one!  Yes, that's what it is.  A journey of discovery, and of coming to terms with death and the measure of one's life.<br /><br />And like life, we get both laughter and tears.<br /><br />Well done!</p></body></html>

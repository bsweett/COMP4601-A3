It's a visually stunning adventure epic that even has a message at its core (although Gibson doesn't beat us over the head with it). Jaguar Paw and his people are attacked and kidnapped to be used as sacrifices for the Mayan gods. It seems that as they have strip mined their own land to build greater temples, they've also caused famine, disease and death to take hold as well. Paw must escape to save his pregnant wife and son who were left behind and are hiding before it is too late.<br /><br />The second half of the film reminded me quite a bit of both Cornell Wilde's "The Naked Prey" and "The Most Dangerous Game" with its cat and mouse chase through the rain forest as Janguar Paw is pursued after he escapes. You should be aware that the film is in ancient Mayan with English, Spanish and French subtitles. The film received an "R" rating for violence probably deserved given the graphic nature of the first half and last third of the film.<br /><br />The film provides an interesting parallel for our modern world; the Mayans (like today) end up destroying much of their world in pursuit of building larger monuments to their greatness and living out their fantasy as the pinnacle of modern civilization. The result is famine, deforestation, disease and death.<br /><br />The sharp direction, performances, cinematography and music allows the viewer to overlook some of the minor flaws of the film such as the simple story.  He also clearly has an innate sense for the power of cinema--the image and he lets the image carry the story knowing, in a sense, that it makes up for the weaknesses of the story itself. Gibson's ecological parable has a corker of an ending that comes totally out of left field (in fact Gibson in his commentary states that the film was originally build around this conclusion which was meant as something of a joke. Surprisingly, that conclusion works very well indeed).<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds stunning. While the extras are somewhat meager (only a short documentary on the making of the film, a deleted scene and a commentary track by co-writer/director/co-producer Gibson with co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia)they aren't fluff. The documentary shows the challenge that Gibson and his crew faced in building many of the massive sets, providing make up for a large group of people and working largely with non-actors.<br /><br />Hopefully a deluxe edition will be in the pipeline at some point with some historical featurettes/documentaries. While the film isn't 100% historical accurate, Gibson uses the trappings well and incorporates as much as he can into the film to give it a feeling of "reality". This is a well made, visually stunning film that deserved a far better outcome at the box office.<br /><br />Sure, this film is a variation on the noble savage theme again but Gibson does such a marvelous job with the material that I'm willing to overlook the cliches of the story itself. Gibson doesn't get preachy in his message but just lays it out there while allowing his film to do the speaking for him.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS, BUT I THINK THIS MOVIE ROCKS!"></head><body><p>All right, I know that some people aren't going to like this movie, but as of me: I LOVE SUSPIRIA!!!!! Just wanted to make that clear, heh.<br />-Now, I will admit that in between the murders, the pace can slow down a bit. But if you're a horror lover or a gorehound, you NEED to see this movie, if only for the kills! Watch in the first where the girl that runs away from the ballet school gets absolutely SAVAGED! It's no wonder Entertainment Weekly referred to it as "the most vicious murder in a horror movie".<br />-The supernatural feel, surreal images and tone, amazing color and unfamiliar setting are absolutely beautiful. This has got to be the most beautiful and mesmerizing display of shocking horror cinematography ever. The foreign setting definitely helps, and captivates the viewer, especially if they're looking for a movie that's just as atmospheric and supernatural as it is bone-chillingly terrifying. So surreal and astounding...LOVE IT!<br />-I found the two-disc version at a very reasonable price, and this is, of course, after I saw it four times before owning it!<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE. IT ISN'T THE MOST FAST-PACED MOVIE EVER AND IT MAY SEEM TO RUN A LITTLE LONG. BUT IF YOU HAVE PATIENCE, WANT SOMETHNG HORRIFYING, VICIOUS, BEAUTIFUL, SURREAL, GENIUS AND GROUNDBREAKING, SUSPIRIA MAY BE AS GREAT A MOVIE TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME.<br />So as you can tell I think this movie rocks! Just watch it with an open mind, be patient, and expect the hardcore horror mastery via Italian director Dario Argento. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

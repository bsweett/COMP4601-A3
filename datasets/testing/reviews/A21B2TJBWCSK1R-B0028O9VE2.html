<meta name="summary" content="Not Your Typical Sandler Comedy"></head><body><p>James L. Brooks' latest movie, Spanglish, seemed to fly right under the critical and commercial radar despite the presence of Adam Sandler. Perhaps it was the misleading trailers that pegged the movie as some kind of goofy Sandler comedy. This couldn't be farther from the truth as the story is told by a young Mexican girl named Christina about her mother, Flor and their misadventures in America.<br /><br />Those expecting Spanglish to be a typical Sandler movie will be disappointed. Brooks prolongs his first on-screen appearance for as long as possible and when it does happen it is in a subtle, understated way with no fanfare. For the first half of the movie, Sandler plays a supporting role, allowing the other actors room to do their thing and then, in the last half, he comes to the foreground as the drama between him and Leoni's character comes to a boil. As brilliant as he was in Punch-Drunk Love, Sandler is even better in Spanglish, dropping most of his usual schtick by playing a nice, normal guy who loves his family. He hits all the right comedic beats but in a quiet, restrained way and ably handles the serious moments too.<br /><br />Ultimately, Brooks' films are about tolerance and optimism in a time when our society is so cynical and jaded. His movies happen in spite of the world outside. Very few mainstream American films deal with class differences and Spanglish tackles it head on as Flor and her daughter's Mexican heritage clash with the Clasky's upscale world.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director James L. Brooks and the film's editors, Richard Marks and Tia Nolan. He speaks eloquently about Spanglish with the editors chiming in occasionally.<br /><br />There are 12 additional scenes, totaling 30 minutes, with optional commentary by Brooks and his editors. We see some of the footage of Flor and Christina in Mexico and a funny scene that gives Georgie more screen-time and pays off an earlier gag where Evelyn was teaching him jazz songs. With most cut footage it is readily apparent why they were cut but most of this footage is excellent and could have been kept in if it hadn't extended an already fairly long movie.<br /><br />"HBO First Look: The Making of Spanglish" is a standard press kit featurette with soundbites from Brooks and the cast mixed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />"Casting Sessions" features footage of some of the supporting cast auditioning for the movie with optional commentary by Brooks. It becomes immediately obvious that these actors were perfect for their roles and that Brooks is a genius at casting his movies.<br /><br />"How to Make the World's Greatest Sandwich featuring Thomas Keller" features footage of the chef (and film's technical advisor) showing Adam Sandler how to make the killer looking (and apparently tasting) modified BLT that his character makes in the movie. Brooks narrates this extra which, in a nice touch, includes written ingredients and instructions so that you can make it on your own!</p></body></html>

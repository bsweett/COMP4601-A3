<meta name="summary" content="not dark enough in tone; too dark on your home screen"></head><body><p>You can read opinions elsewhere as there are 575 of them on .com as I write this. Saw this for the first time in whole in 2010 after Inception came out. I have to say there is stuff in Dark City I thought Inception lifted and did far better especially the creation of these new worlds where buildings arise and fall at night (in Inception case it's in dreams).<br /><br />What doesn't work in this movie is it is too dark--not the theme but the lighting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the title is Dark City but it is hard to see anything on screen at times.<br /><br />Also, what is up with Kiefer Sutherland and what seems like his attempt at a Peter Lorre accent?<br /><br />Felt the story was unique and had legs but the execution of it was, well, the whole thing looked a bit like a made-for-TV movie. I know there are comparisons to Fritz Lang's Metropolis but this movie is not even remotely close to the genius of that man's filmic vision.<br /><br />To top it off the extras are laughable on this version of the DVD. All we get are notes and still pics. It's ridiculously bad. You may have just sent people to a Web site if you were not going to have a "making of," etc.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a ripoff! Wait for a new edition!"></head><body><p>I am not going to talk about the movie as the star I am giving it is to the DVD release of this film.<br /><br />Yeah, two different version are released, the regular and the so called 'Stan Lee's edition'<br /><br />My problem? Both editions contain a single DVD. This movie was released in region 4 in Mexico weeks before it hit the shelves in the US in a far superior 2 DVD boxed set. Yeah, you read correctly, the first DVD contains the movie in the same edition as this one with the deleted scenes and the second DVD is loaded with interviews, trailers, animatics, documentaries (including Brett Rattner's diaries and the 'Evolution of the trilogy') and extra features. The bonus disc is already produced and finished yet not released in the US.<br /><br />Get ready to buy within a couple months the 'X3.5' or whatever crappy name they give to this movie on a 2 disc edition.<br /><br />Since I have a multiregion DVD player I am going to get the region 4 edition and then edit my review here. Thought fans of the movie and the comics should be aware of this before buying to decide which edition is better for them to collect.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Shrek' The Mediocre"></head><body><p>The worn path of `Shrek The Third' reeks of obligatory sequel and becomes 'Shrek' The Mediocre. `Shrek' 1 and 2 were charming, yet crudely funny, providing a remarkably dynamic and well-rounded entertainment. Much of the humor is lost: Crude without funny falls flat. With a noticeable diminution of charm, even the lovable characters seem worn thin this trek. Often the lines are lame insults or tired clich&eacute;s. Episodic and sometimes random, Shrek seems to have run out of gas.<br /><br />The plot is planted solidly enough. The Frog King, on his death lily pad, croaks his last, making Shrek (Myers) his heir. Shrek, the Reluctant, looks for Arthur (Timberlake) attending a land remote from "Far, Far Away" to take his place. Meanwhile, Feona (Diaz) is expecting their own family heir, providing a dream sequence about baby fluids, and a chance for another sequel. Strengthening the conflict, however, is Prince Charming (Everett), a washed up dinner theater actor for the rotten tomatoes crowd. He reaps his revenge at a rough bar of broken dreams summoning Snow White's witch and other misfits to challenge Shrek and his cohorts.<br /><br />To be fair, a new magician does have Puss N' Boots (Banderas) and Donkey (Murphy) "trading places" in one scene, but these laughs are the exception. (Indeed both characters are the core merits for this sequel, and some sight gags live up to 'Shrek' legend.)  The satire is lost with stereotypical jokes at Arthur's Worcestershire School, and the same Zen wizard waxing about "serentity circles" and "Primal (Scream) Therapy". (Lame)  Remarkable animation and past characterization only partly save this sequel.<br /><br />Otherwise, we can only hope a new `Shrek' movie will be more inspired and not based on deadlines.

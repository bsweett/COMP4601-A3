<meta name="summary" content="A Movie Even A Proust Scholar Could Love!"></head><body><p>In this era of big money, Hollywood blockbuster productions ("Harry Potter", "Spiderman" ETC.) it feels most satisfying to find a small, amiable, entertaining, film comedy like "Little Miss Sunshine", that seems to depend on nothing more than a good script and fine acting performances. To watch it win numerous awards and do reasonably well at the box office is even better!<br /><br />In "Little Miss Sunshine" we are introduced to the harried, dysfunctional Hoover family, which seems to be just barely getting by. The Father, Richard (Greg Kinear) is a would-be motivational speaker, trying to make a big deal happen, in order get financial investors for his program. The Mom, Sheryl (Toni Colette) is dealing with the family's financial stresses, plus everyone elses problems. This includes her brother, Frank (Steve Carell) an academic, who has come to live with the family after a recent suicide attempt, over a gay love affair with a student. The Hoover's depressed son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy to achieve his dream to fly. The family's drug addicted, Grandpa (an excellent Alan Arkin) is an overly opinionated old man, who lets his expletive filled, tactless comments fly if you want to hear them or not. Finally, in the title role is seven year old, Olive (Abigail Breslin) a sweet little girl with a sunny disposition and an obsession with beauty pageants.<br /><br />The Hoovers recieve a phone call, that Olive has made the finals of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' Beauty Pageant in Rodondo Beach, CA. We watch as this eccentric family climbs into a decrepit, un-airconditioned, yellow, VW Micro-bus and make the 700 mile journey, which is filled with both big laughs, drama and tears. We watch as they try to follow their hopes & dreams and learn, that sometimes it just dosn't matter if you fit-in or not. In other words, sometimes you have to just let your 'Freak Flag Fly'!<br /><br />Co-Directors, Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris' have done a sure and steady job creating a wonderful film. Likewise, Screen Writer, Michael Ardnt's Academy Award winning script ("Best Writing, Original Screenplay") is filled with rich, well-rounded characters, witty, funny dialogue and a story that makes the viewer care.<br /><br />But the best attribute of the film is the talented ensemble cast of actors, who's peformances really made this movie. Toni Colette is a accomplished actress, who always seems to just disapear into her roles. She is just great as the stressed out mom, who keeps everyone together. Greg Kinear, who I havn't exactly been a big fan of in the past, does a terrific job as the frustrated, desperate Dad, who just won't give up on his goals. Alan Arkan won an Oscar ("Best Performance By an Actor in a Supporting Role") as the foul-mouthed Grandpa, provided some of the film's biggest laughs, while showing a lot of heart. Like-wise, Steve Carell's (in a pre-"Office" role) depressed, Proust Scholar is an excellent performance, providing dead panned laughs and loads of outsider wisdom. Finally, Abigail Breslin is a juvenile actress, who is in a star-making role and more than holds her own with her fellow performers. Bravo to the whole brilliant cast!<br /><br />"Little Miss Sunshine" really is 'the little film that could'. It's funny and moving, providing themes about being yourself and not being afraid to go after your dreams. Great Movie! Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific entertainment!"></head><body><p>"Back To The Future" has rightly attained classic status as one of the most entertaining films from the 1980's. It was an unexpected smash the summer of it's release, and one of those movies where images and phrases become part of popular culture within a weekend.<br />I feel the most impressive achievement by the filmmakers is the perfectly balanced tone of the movie. After all, upon going back in time, Marty (Michael J. Fox) finds his own mother has "the hots" for him. High potential for creepiness, but it's handled so deftly and sweetly it works wonderfully.<p>The underlying theme, echoed often by the filmmakers on the supplements, is the realization that your parents were once teenagers. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover draw crisp portraits of Marty's folks, filled with delightful little details.<p>Zemeckis and company also balance the "period piece" nature of the film with the "sci-fi" elements in a way that neither one overwhelms the other. They also simultaneously remember the 50's with a rosy, reverent glow while tweaking it's nose a bit.<p>Watching it again after all these years, I was amazed at how everything works, and at how well it has aged. The funny thing, is that the movie is so well done, the 80's is presented as sweetly as the 50's, now seen from the 21st century. In a goofy way, the movie is its' own time machine. It takes you right back. It's a wonderful film.<p>Now for the sequels. Reductio ad absurdum, "Number 2" is the dark, twisted flip side to the first film. It's a Gordian knot of time travel complications. There is a level of genius in having a sequel that revisits the original from a different perspective, from tone to script to even camera angles...the "perspective" is skewed.<p>"Number 3" gives Doc (Christopher Lloyd) a chance to be the center of the film, and by going further back in time, the film offers more simple, less serious options to wrapping up the three films. It's a Western, giving Fox and friends a chance to play on horses, shoot guns and lasso things.<p>While the first film is perfect on it's own, the other two are infinitely better taken as a whole rather than as separate films. They're not totally necessary, but nicely fill out a sort of "BTTF" universe.<p>Smartly packaged as an affordable three-disc set, with nifty extras and outtakes that'll leave you begging for more (there's a great "appearance" by Roger Rabbit), this is one of the safest purchases you'll make!</p></body></html>

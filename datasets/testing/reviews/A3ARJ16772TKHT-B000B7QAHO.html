<meta name="summary" content="Fanciful and fantastic"></head><body><p>This one captures the magic of Dahl's book perfectly.  Any kid would love the imagery. The original "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" has plenty of imagination, but there are moments where it gets overly tedious. For instance, it took way too long to get into the factory itself. Then there were the unnecessary musical interludes ("Cheer Up Charly"? Puh-lease.)<br /><br />In this new iteration, however, you will notice that they get to the factory as soon as possible. There are not even any songs until they finally arrive at the door of the factory. This helps further differentiate the imaginative, fantastical air of the factory from the monotonous drudgery of the "real world". When we first watched it in the theater (I went with my brother, his wife and their [then] two daughters) my brother admitted that he was so surprised that they didn't have a long unnecessary song in the scene where Grandpa Joe gets out of bed for the first time in years. The scene played out better for that simple omission.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy the Gene Wilder version, but this one has a charm and energy that is simply frenetic, while the other one got a bit too caught up in justifying certain aspects of the story-telling.<br /><br />Wonderful movie. Imaginative and colorful. Even the elements that were added to the story (i.e. Willy Wonka's relationship with his father) have a very Roald Dahl feel to them.</p></body></html>

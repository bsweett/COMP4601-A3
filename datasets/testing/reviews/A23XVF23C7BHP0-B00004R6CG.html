It is obvious why he was a favourite of Alfred Hitchcock's. Here he shows not only his usual charm, but also a slightly sinister side, evidence of his great talents as an actor and not just a star. The plot is interesting, and best enjoyed if you don't try to guess ahead. The restored version shows the beautiful colour of the original and particularly the fine costume design. The sound restoration is also worthy of mention. It is handled sensitively by re-creating the sound effects in stereo and adding a clean copy of the Bernard Hermann score to the best versions of the dialogue the restorers could find. It might lack authenticity but it does make the film more enjoyable than some of the worn-out prints we had been used to, which really did not do the film justice.</p></body></html>

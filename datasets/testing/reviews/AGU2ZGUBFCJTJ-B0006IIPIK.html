<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - 'Tomorrow' Looks Brighter Then Ever"></head><body><p>Looking back in time you would think the Americans of the 1920s and 1930s were nuts when it came to concepts of the world of tomorrow. To many scientists of the modern day, these "visions of the future" are clumsy, primitive and na?ve but to young children, and even some older readers, these were a form of escape from the less-enthralling realism of the post-World War I depression era that consumed the country at the time. Science would soon blend with the comic-book/science fiction world creating such astounding superheroes as Superman, Flash Gordon, and Buck Rodgers. This concept would eventually spill over into the realm of the movies, spawning now classic films such as The Invisible Man, The Island of Lost Souls, King Kong, and many more. Today, we look back upon these films, often laughing at the now amusing concepts and clich&eacute;d situations, but at the same time feeling a bit nostalgia for a time when things seemed, at least in our minds now, a bit simpler then they are now.<br /><br />The story for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow takes the futuristic visions of the world as dreamed up in the science-fiction comic books of the 1950s and brings them to life in brilliant style and texture. Though the world seems brighter and better then ever after the horrible events of World War I and the Great Depression, danger still loams on the horizon. Scientists, who were part of an underground doomsday project created before the outbreak of the First World War, are mysteriously disappearing from across the world - six have already been abducted, with the seventh highly aware of his dire situation and looking for safe haven. He soon comes into contact with the ambitious Polly Perkins, an adamant reporter for The Chronicle, and tells her the identity of the mastermind behind a serious of raids on the city conducted by gigantic mechanical robots - Dr. Totenkopf, the same devilishly brilliant scientist behind the organization of the doomsday project. After receiving this startling information, she then pays a visit to an old friend, Sky Captain and his mercenary fighter pilots known as the Flying Legion, who may be the world's only hope from absolute destruction. The story for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is more then simply a vision of "the future that never was", at least outside the realm of comic-books, but offers an enthralling storyline combined with a rousing musical score, entertaining performances, and stunning action sequences, all balanced together in a well-formulated film-noir style of filmmaking. Is it jammed packed with clich&eacute;s and unrealistic situations? Of course it is and that's what makes this film one of the most pleasant surprises of the year, namely for the fact that those clich&eacute;s are actually used to help it achieve a level of entertainment that is so rarely seen in modern cinema.<br /><br />Another keen move by first-time director Kerry Conran was to enlist as few high profile performers as possible in order to keep the actions of the film centralized on the two leads, namely Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Though some may have dispute with some of their past performances, kudos must be given to these two for carrying this entire experimental project on their shoulders and for doing it as ideally as they did. Jude Law fits flawlessly into the role of flying ace Sky Captain and pulls off a performance reminiscent of Harrison Ford's in the Indiana Jones series, though with far less prestige and anticipation then Ford's signature role. Even the character himself gives off the suggestion that he might be a direct takeoff on the famous archeologist but perhaps that's what makes the movie all the more attractive and ultimately more enjoyable. Gwyneth Paltrow also gives a commendable performance, though slightly less savoring then Law's but, then again, that was expected considering he is the hero of the film. And Michael Gambon, who recently took over the role of Professor Dumbledore in the immensely popular Harry Potter series, makes a slight appearance in the film as the editor of the Chronicle. His character isn't exceptionally important to the overall storyline but it was just good to see him on screen once again, at least for those who enjoyed the Singing Detective television episodes. There are two minor complaints when it comes to the area of performances in this film: the first being the most blatantly obvious one, that the actors frequently gave some stilted, wood-like performances in particular sequences, but this was to be as expected after the some-what bumbling work that appeared in Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The other issue being the role of Angelina Jolie, more specifically the character of Franky Cook. Whether this is the fault of the advertising department or the filmmakers, Jolie's role was built up as this prominent co-starring role when in actuality it's nothing more then a mere cameo. One can say that they may be holding up on the character in order to broaden her role in any sequels, or quite possible prequels, should this film prove to be a success. These two aren't what would be called "deal breakers" for this film; rather they are just minor annoyances that merely need to be addressed.<br /><br />Overall, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow rattles the box office from its usual post-Labor Day slumber and brings about an experience that can best be described as this generation's Raiders of the Lost Ark. The feature's obvious draw will be its astonishing special effects (seriously, the entire film is done in computer animation, with the exception of the actors of course) but thankfully the film relies on a cleverly-crafted script to back it up, rather then depending on a one-trick pony to simply get butts in the seats. Some individuals may go into this film with the impression that it will end up being nothing more then a clich&eacute;d special effects extravaganza and, in one respect, they would be right but what separates this film from the rest of the trash that has been cluttering the movie theaters for the past few weeks is that Sky Captain has created its own separate identity and hasn't simply cut-and-pasted ideas from the competition. The script, though not absolutely believable, does what it's suppose to do and that's namely to entertain audiences without going so over the top so that it becomes ridiculous and not worth your time. And what could one ask for more then a villain who comes off as an extremist social-liberal wacko who believes mankind is doomed to destroy itself and should be punished for ruining the planet and filling the world with hatred? Sure this guy may be a god to the left-wing fringe of the Hollywood elite, namely everyone but Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis, but we all know better. Should this film prove to be a success at the box office, it would not be surprising in the least to see this bud into an affluent franchise in the not too distant future, something of high demand from the movie-going public with The Lord of the Rings now done and over with and Harry Potter possibly on the ropes. Bottom-line, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may not be everyone's cup of magnesia milk but for those tired of sequels and the same old tired retreads, this is the film for you.</p></body></html>

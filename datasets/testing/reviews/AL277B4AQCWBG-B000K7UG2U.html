Yet this isn't so much a bold re-imagining as thoughtful one - skillfully written, masterfully played, and wonderfully shot.  As you can always expect from Jonathan Demme, it's a beautifully crafted film.  If you've seen and admired the original, you won't be bored.  While the plots are similar they're far from identical, and Demme unfolds his with perfect smart-thriller timing and a contemporary narrative style, often deploying a highly economical use of images, voiceover and inter-cut scenes - an excellent device for delivering maximum information in the shortest possible time.  There's also a lot to enjoy in the performances.  Denzel Washington manages to be simultaneously charismatic and pathetic, perfectly capturing the essence of the damaged solider.  Meryl Streep is destined for her fourteenth Oscar nomination, and possibly a win for Best Supporting Actress.  While she doesn't deliver the same kind of desperate mania as Angela Lansbury's original (a performance Streep deliberately avoided seeing before the shoot), she manages to be equally creepy, mainly because her ruthless and cunning  character is so disturbingly familiar to any observer of politics.  The Oedipal bath scene is particularly chilling.  Overall, this is a satisfying film: not only a respectful remake, but a solid thriller in its own right.  And it's worth noting also, in what is surely the most wonderful irony, that forty years after the original movie the Red Menace has been replaced by capitalism's darkest and equally dangerous breed - the global military-industrial corporation, with designs on political power.  What isn't so funny is how close to reality it is.  Bush doesn't have a chip in his head, but he does have a piece in one ear and Dick Cheney in the other - which is probably somewhat worse.</p></body></html>

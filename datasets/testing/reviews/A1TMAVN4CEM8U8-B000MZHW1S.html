<meta name="summary" content="BLOODY AND GRUSOME"></head><body><p>Blood Diamond<br /><br />Blood Diamond is about a man who is captured by rebels in Sierra Leone, on the West coast of Africa,  and is made a slave panning for diamonds.  When he finds one the size of the end of his thumb he tries to smuggle it out.  The movie is about his trials and tribulations trying to reunite his family and get the diamond out.  Leonardo plays a smuggler who is helping him for a share of the proceeds.<br /><br />Somewhat recommended for action adventure fans, but be warned it is bloody and gruesome in parts.<br /><br />Gunner  October,2007</p></body></html>

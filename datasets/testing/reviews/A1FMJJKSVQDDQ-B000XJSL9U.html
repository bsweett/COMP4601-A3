This one isn't really in the same league, but it's not as awful as it seems. First off, I will say that it's really nice to see Bruce Willis return as John McClane. He's still awesome here as he was in the first three. Plus, the action is still exciting the fourth time around: lots of explosions and gunfights and car chases. Unfortunately, this film probably the most flawed in the entire series. One of the problems is the presence of Justin Long. Now, I don't have anything against this guy, but he doesn't seem to fit in the movie. He's more of a distraction rather than an ordinary supporting character. Secondly, the climax is very weak: compared to the climaxes in the first three Die Hard films, this one fails miserably. And finally, Kevin Smith's cameo was more aggravating than amusing. Even the joke about Boba Fett didn't hit the right notes. Basically, Live Free or Die Hard isn't as good as the first three, but it still has enough action and humor to hold your interest. It's still very fun.<br /><br />Grade: C+<br /><br />P.S., let's not forget about the first three Die Hard films.<br />Die Hard: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a><br /><br />Die Hard 2: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRM">Die Hard 2 - Die Harder</a><br /><br />Die Hard with a Vengeance: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O78KW4">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a></p></body></html>

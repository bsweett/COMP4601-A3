<meta name="summary" content="Southern Ghost Story With Magic"></head><body><p>A young health care professional disgusted with hospice care takes a job looking after a dying Southern gentleman.  The lady of the house is very old South but they manage to get along.  To help care for the man she is given a key to the whole house, a skeleton key.<br /><br />But there is one door in the attic that the key will not open.  Soon the suspense of possible ghosts builds and thickens.  Slavery, prejudice and hoodoo seem to be part of what is going on in the house.  Before long lines are crossed from psychosomatic to belief and the story surges forward at a furious pace.<br /><br />The mix of ghost story and magic really worked with the Southern setting and created a truly chilling story.  Not a straight ghost story, not straight horror film, but a unique blend with a fresh twist that really raises the hackles.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

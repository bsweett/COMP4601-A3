There are some funny moments, certainly, but the whole movie is just too deep, dark, and meaningful to be dismissed as mere comedy.  Your reaction to the film may well depend on what kind of person you are - or were back in school.  If you were cool and ran with the in crowd, you'll probably laugh - condescendingly, of course - at the losers who make up the main characters of the story.  If you were an oddball and have drunk deeply from the waters of alienation, however, you will feel a real kinship with these characters.  The only bad thing about this film is the fact that there isn't enough of Scarlett Johansson in it.  It's really all about the character of Enid (Thora Birch), an incredibly complex character who wears alienation like a crown and tries to avoid total decimation at the hands of a cruel, mixed-up life.  We start out with Enid and her friend Rebecca (Johansson), but - for obvious reasons - Rebecca has a lifeline to normalcy and makes a much better transition to post-high school existence than her friend.  The fact that her partner is crime begins to grow apart from her only makes Enid's journey all the more difficult to navigate - and there is much to fuel her contempt for the world.<br /><br />The plan is for Enid and Rebecca to gets jobs and rent an apartment together, playing pranks and generally complaining about how fake and stupid everyone else is in their spare time.  After Rebecca starts working, though, you can start to see that her heart's just not in their long-held plans, while Enid just sort of sleepwalks through each day with no purpose whatsoever - apart from attending the remedial art class she has to take during the summer.  She does find a project for herself, though - one extremely weird fellow named Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Of course, it begins with her setting the hapless Seymour up on a fake blind date and watching him suffer through the internal agony of being stood up.  She follows him, though, and the two strike up an unusual friendship.  Seymour is a great collector of classic jazz and blues records and an odd assortment of other things, and he basically lives in that forgotten world he has recreated for himself.  Enid sets out to find Seymour a girlfriend - which is quite a project indeed, as Seymour is almost hopelessly undesirable in the eyes of the world (or at least the 99% of it that Enid hates so much).<br /><br />Then Enid's world starts closing in on her in all sorts of ways.  Always alienated, she now begins to feel completely alone, and she basically keeps sabotaging her chances of reversing course (which is an unfortunate habit most of us weirdoes seem to have).  Every day brings bad news on some front.  By this point, the comedy is basically over and done with, and the final third of the film comes across as a nuanced, poignant look at this poor soul who truly doesn't know what she is going to do with the rest of her life - or even tomorrow, for that matter.<br /><br />I could say more, but this is really one of those films that you can't really explain.  There's no real sense of closure when the movie ends, but that is indicative of life itself - and that is really what Ghost World is all about.  Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi give inspired performances that will stay with you, Scarlett Johansson is marvelous, and some oddball characters (such as Numchuck Guy) round the film out quite well.  It's quirky, but quirky is almost always good.  I'm not sure how older people will react to this sort of film, but the younger generation will see much of themselves somewhere in this weird story, making Ghost World one of the most impressive coming-of-age movies of the new millennium.</p></body></html>

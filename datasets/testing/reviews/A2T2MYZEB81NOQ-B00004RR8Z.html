<meta name="summary" content="Alien 3-A good movie. Not quite a super one, though."></head><body><p>Overall, I liked this movie. There was a lot of supsense, blood, & fighting, just like the first two, and I liked the way Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself so no one else would be attacked by Aliens. It was a noble and gallant thing for her to do. I also liked the many times the other crew members swore at each other, and the final and deciding fight with the final Alien. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because though it was good all in all, there was too much chit-chat and not enough intensity and battle. But it was still a pretty good movie. It gets 7 points out of 10. If you are bored and  have nothing to do, rent and watch this film.</p></body></html>

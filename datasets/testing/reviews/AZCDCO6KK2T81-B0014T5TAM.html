<meta name="summary" content="The problems with "Atonement" are forgivable."></head><body><p>Although I gave this film four stars overall, it is problematic.  Having said that, this movie is stunningly filmed and very well acted.<br /><br />The film has a wide appeal in that it's a period piece, a romance story, a war epic, and it's strongly centered around a theme we can all relate to, atoning for one's sin(s).  In addition, the acting in this film is first-rate.  Keira Knightly is both stunningly beautiful for such a fragile looking thing and shows that she can really act beyond her "Pirates" role to which this character is very far removed.  Also, James McAvoy is terrific and gives another star making performance (as he had done in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland </a>).  All of the supporting cast members are equally excellent in this film.  Of course, one of the film's greatest assets is its cinematography.  This film is sumptuously filmed and the one take beach shot of the retreating British army is unforgettable.<br /><br />However, the telling of the story is the film's greatest problem in that there are shifts in point of view and time periods with little or no lead in or explanation.  Yes, I know they are intentional, but that doesn't mean they were done well.  Even when one is paying attention to the film, the shifts are often abrupt and very distracting until one figures out what is going on.  These shifts make the film seem disjointed and poorly edited.  I'm not sure who is to blame for this approach as it could be the director, the writers, the editor or some combination of all three, which is where I think the blame does lie.  Now, in spite of this very strong criticism, this is still an excellent film.<br /><br />The plot is outlined by Amazon very well, but their praise is, in my view, rather excessive.  In any event, you can read their summary which is informative and accurate.  In short form, it's the story that spans about four years in which a very young girl has a crush on the son of a house servant who himself has a crush on the oldest daughter in the home.  That quiet crush ends up being mutual and erupts into a secret love affair that is, unfortunately, discovered by the very jealous younger sister who feel betrayed by the boy and she sets out to destroy him.  It's the classic, "If I can't have you, no one can" scenario.  The young girl tells a huge lie that sends the boy to jail and then to war.  She attempts "atonement" not by ever saying she's sorry or by recanting her vicious accusation, but rather by becoming a nurse and caring for wounded soldiers.  The audience is left to decide if she achieves atonement or not by her actions.<br /><br />For myself, I am rather old fashioned about forgiveness in that I think little can substitute for a sincere and straight-forward apology to the persons affected.  How can one expect forgiveness if he or she never actually asks for it or even owns up to what he or she actually did?  In addition, the person asking forgiveness needs to understand that a simple "I'm sorry" doesn't "fix" the problems created and some times an apology isn't enough and needs to be coupled with appropriate reparations.<br /><br />Of course, the victim can certainly find it in his or her heart to forgive someone for a bad action even without the other asking for forgiveness, but that doesn't diminish the need/requirement of one to own up to what he or she did and simply trying to lead a better life afterwards, as done in this film, doesn't pay the bill entirely even though it is a praiseworthy thing to do.  An apology ought to also be coupled by a change in behavior and in this story the young girl does this, but I am very disturbed by her reluctance to ever tell anyone what she did or, at the very least, ask forgiveness directly from the people she hurt so much.<br /><br />Of course, the acceptance of an apology is often a tricky thing too and we have no clue how the main characters in this film would accept an apology if it was offered.  For starters, one has to examine if the apology is sincere or not.  Personally, I think people should be a graceful as possible in accepting apologies as it takes a lot of humility to offer an apology that includes noting the wrong that was done.  All too often in our society today we have this need to win at all costs and even when someone gives us a heartfelt apology, we sometimes feel the need to stomp all over the person anyhow.  Perhaps it is part of that eye for eye, tooth for a tooth mentality.  One accepts the apology, but must get some revenge anyhow to "equal" out things.  To me that's not accepting an apology as forgiveness means releasing a person from the burden of guilt he or she has with no strings attached. I can't help but think the characters in this story would have gone down this path had an apology been offered.  Well, one can only hope.<br /><br />Respectfully Submitted 06/08,<br />Steve Hedge</p></body></html>

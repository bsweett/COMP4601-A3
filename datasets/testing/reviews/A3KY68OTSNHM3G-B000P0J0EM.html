<meta name="summary" content="A Superior Motion Picture"></head><body><p>Boasting an all-star cast led by Tom Hanks (Paul Edgecomb), David Morse (Brutus Howell), Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey), Barry Pepper (Dean Stanton), James Cromwell (Warden Hal Moores), Doug Hutchison (Percy Wetmore) and Michael Jeter (Eduard Delacroix), director Frank Darabont has created a wondorous movie about special relationships between guards and captives, husbands and wives, and prisoners.<br /><br />Hanks stars as Paul Edgecomb, a prison security guard in charge of the death row section of Cold Mountain Penitentiary.  His life is fairly normal until a prisoner named John Coffey is brought into death row.  Coffey is a gentle giant who brings a sense of spirit and humility to his fellow inmates and guards.  He also possesses supernatural powers which he uses for the good of his fellow man.  Wrongfully accused of murdering two young girls, Coffey, being black, is immediately suspected and ultimately sentenced to die for this crime.  While awaiting execution, he magically transforms death row into an area of caring and compassion.<br /><br />Paul Edgecomb experiences Coffey's powers first-hand.  Suffering from a terrible urinary tract infection, he is miraculously healed by Coffey.  Also, Delacroix's pet mouse Mr. Jingles (who really steals the show, in my opinion), is resurrected by Coffey after a vindictive Percy steps on him.  Even Warden Moores' wife, who is suffering from a terminal brain tumor, is healed by Coffey's magical touch.  Coffey also uses his special powers to show Edgecomb that he is really innocent of the charges against him.  However, Coffey doesn't want anything to change, merely saying that he wants everything to come to an end.  Sadly, Edgecomb and his crew accept Coffey's decision, even though they know he is innocent.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  The story is first-rate, and the acting, led by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, is outstanding.  The execution scenes are carried out with remarkable realism, as well.  Based on the novel by Stephen King, the movie is actually better than the book was.  I was impressed with the relationship that developed between Coffey and the guards and how their friendship deepend until the final scene, where the guards are openly crying while carrying out Coffey's final wish.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  This is not your typical Stephen King slasher film.  Rather, it is one that will touch your soul and uplift your spirit.  Watch and see how a gentle giant uses his powers to help others while unselfishly sacrificing himself.</p></body></html>

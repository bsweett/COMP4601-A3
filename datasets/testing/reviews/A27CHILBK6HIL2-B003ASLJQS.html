<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Better Films Out There But Somewhat Over Praised"></head><body><p>MOVIE: This was a favorite come the time of the Oscars and really showed some talented actors doing their thing. Personally I felt that this movie was a well made film but I think it got more praise than it deserved.  I'm really glad that it only won its Oscars for its acting because when it came down to the story it was just an above average crime drama.  What makes the movie above average is that it doesn't just deal with the "whodunnit" factor, it really incorporates the characters into the story. There is so much character development that it really shows the audience the true darkness of human nature.  Everybody was praising Clint Eastwood for this movie when all the credit should go to the actors and actresses in the picture.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Marcia Gay Harden (I still can't figure out how someone can get a name like that) all gave stellar performances. I really feel that it was overrated.  It is one of the greatest crime dramas out there its just that so is Se7en, and so is Life of David Gale.  A great movie that had so much support from the critics that it ended up being loved by everybody.<p>VIDEO: Very nice transfer from warner that really handles the dark scenes very well.<p>AUDIO: The 5.1 mix is a little soft in places but overall decent.<p>PACKAGING / EXTRAS: This review is pertaining to the 3 disc edition.  The Digipak comes in a slip sleeve and folds out into three segment. In the center you have the feature disc, and on the right you have the other two discs overlapping each other in a design that was done with the Pink Panther Film Collection. The left flap is just printed cardboard.  Disc 1 just has a commentary. Disc 2 has a platter of really "movie buff" extras.  First up is the standard making of, a 23 minute featurette called Mystic River- Beneath the Surface.  Next is an 11 minute segment titled Mystic River- From Page to Screen, mainly dealing with the actors.  Then there are The Charlie Rose Show Interviews. Eastwood's interview is 42 minutes, Robbins' is 50 minutes, and Bacon's is 19 minutes. These are not bull interviews but real good conversations about the movie. Disc 3 is the soundtrack to the film, which I was not a fan of. I really think Eastwood shouldn't have composed the soundtrack because I felt that it was too unemotional.  Maybe he wanted it that way so that all the emotion could come from the fine acting, but I just felt that it didn't support the tone of the movie as well as it could have. Overall it's a 2-disc version with the soundtrack attached. Definately worth buying versus the single disc edition. Plus you don't want another pesky WB snapper case would you?<p>MOVIE SCORE: (* * * *)<br />DVD SCORE: (9 / 10)</p></body></html>

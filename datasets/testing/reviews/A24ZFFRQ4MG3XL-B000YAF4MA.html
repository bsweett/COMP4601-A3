I almost don't know anyone who's not affected by cancer in some form or another and the reality of making a list of what you'd like to do before you die is depressing, yet somehow moving and touching.  I really like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman and ultimately, I think that's what sold me about seeing this and now I'm glad that I did.<br />The chemistry between Morgan and Jack was amazing.  This is definately one of the most fun and uplifting movies I'd seen in a while and yes I cried in it, but also there were moments of laughter too.  Edward Cole (Nicholson) is wealthy and through his money, he and Carter Chambers (Freeman) do things like touring the world, race car driving and skydiving.<br />Other than the cheesy dialogue and some predictability, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's a feel good movie with a lesson that you shouldn't need to have a death sentance over you to start living.  Also being faced with death doesn't mean you can't live out the rest of your time rather than fall into depression and accept your fate.  I cannot say enough about how good this film is and I hope you will to.  It's definately worth watching for sure.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Warmed Over Spielberg for Kids"></head><body><p>J.J. Abrams, "Super 8" unabashedly draws on Spielberg films such as "E.T", "Close Encounters of the the Third Kind" and even a little of his version of the "War of the Worlds."  The story is pretty contrived and the ending very predictable.  It's obvious how it's going to turn out after about 45 minutes, especially with a bunch of kids leading the cast.  Given that the film is presumed to be set in the late 70s, I'm pretty sure the use of "totally" as an affirmative had not yet entered teen-speak by that time, at least in Ohio.  L.A., maybe --  Ohio, never.</p></body></html>

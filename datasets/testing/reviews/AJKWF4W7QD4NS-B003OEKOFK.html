Hot Tub Time Machine revolves around middle-aged friends Adam (John Cusack), Lou (Rob Corddry), and Nick (Craig Robinson), who along with Adam's teen nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), wind up going back in time to the 80s after a drunken hot tub accident.  It doesn't take too long for the trio to attempt to relive their glory days, with the end result being a cavalcade of raunchy and mostly funny stuff happening.  Seeing John Cusack in this kind of movie makes Hot Tub Time Machine worth watching in itself, along with the fact that he's actually pretty funny in it, as are everyone else, including Crispin Glover as a would-be armless bellhop and Chevy Chase who appears all too-briefly as the repairman who holds the key to everyone getting back home.  Though it does lose speed by its final quarter, Hot Tub Time Machine remains a fun, spirited, and raunchy-enough endeavor that is good for some laughs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jason in 3D on DVD at last...and the movie is bloody good !"></head><body><p>Part 3 of Friday the 13th - this is also a good offering as were parts 1 and 2. I have always thought the first 3 were really the best & got worse after Part 3. More dumb teenagers go to Camp Crystal Lake and Jason hacks them all off one by one. There is no one to root for but Jason. Characters are goofy or just dumb. The suspense/scary moments were plentiful. Gore and nudity as usual. There is even a shower sequence (a nod to Psycho ?)<br />The DVD can be seen in 2D and 3D. So far I watched it in 2D - the 2D print was kind of grainy for the first 18 minutes but was ok from there.<br />When I see it in 3D ill add to my review...so right at this moment I can say this film is still part of the good early ones and recommended to any Friday the 13th fans.</p></body></html>

This flick just smacks of deja vu.  It's not bad King but it's not particularly great.  The blocked writer in a remote setting with murder and mayhem ensuing is just so familiar.  What elevates the film beyond the mundane are game performances by Johnny Depp as the harried writer and John Turturro delivering an inspired turn straight from "Night of the Hunter".  Maria Bello looks hot but essentially wasted.  Forgettable in the near extreme.</p></body></html>

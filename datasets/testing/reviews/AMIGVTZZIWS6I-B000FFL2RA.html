The problem is, when Hollywood does create good quality films -- and believe it or not, there are several -- no one goes to see them.  Kingdom of Heaven is, in my opinion, a prime example of that.  This is the best presentation of the Crusades I have ever seen.  It not only shows the heroism of the men and women who thought they were doing God's work, but also the futility of the entire exercise.  The films also does an admirable job of presenting the Crusades in as even-handed a manner as possible. Both Christians and Muslims are presented without bias one way or another -- at least for the most part.  Usually, in films of this nature, the Christians are shown as these flawless heroes setting out to free the Holy Land from the clutches of the heathen Muslims, but not Kingdom of Heaven.  I would say this film does the best job of presenting both the good and the bad qualities of both sides, and leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions.  Of course, this film does have some biases.  At it's heart the film is very anti-war, not to mention anti-religion.  The anti-war part comes through in its depiction of King Baldwin (played by Edward Norton behind a mask) who would rather make Jerusalem of city for all faiths, with the help of Saladin, of course.  However, forces out of his control conspire to take Jerusalem to war and remove Baldwin from the throne.  It is anti-religion not because of any hatred towards religion, but because the Church used its influence with the populace to drive the Crusade and were usually the first to run and hide when the going got tough.  These are, of course, reasons why conservatives would cry liberal bias, but that's only because they are often too narrow-minded to see anything beyond a rigid set of ideas.<br /><br />The cast of this film is excellent.  This is the best work I've seen out of Orlando Bloom; Marton Csokas is wonderfully evil as Guy de Lusignan; and Ghassan Massoud gives a very interesting portrayal of Saladin.  Of special note is Edward Norton who plays the role of King Baldwin from behind a mask that hides the character's leprosy.  This film is epic in the finest sense of the word and deserved far more attention than it received at thebox office.</p></body></html>

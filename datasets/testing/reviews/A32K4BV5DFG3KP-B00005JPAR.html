<meta name="summary" content="Enlightenment awaits."></head><body><p>First of all this movie is all set in the present time, at least I thought so, the rest of it is just a manuscript from within the movie. Looking for a way to help his dying wife a brilliant surgeon discovers a miracle drug that seems to reverse aging. His wife dies before he can administer the drug. He consequently suffers a mental/nervous breakdown. Finally through a ?"Dream sequence " the doctor is enlightened and discovers that death is just the transformation of the journey,  just another vehicle like the body, only without form. He becomes the Buddha or the enlightened one in the end, sitting underneath his Bodhi tree, understanding that you can not cling to life or anything, because it is only a journey, not a destination, he becomes one with universe. The visual effects of the movie are stunning, and the subliminal messages are many. Overall it kind of reminded of VANILLA SKY, beautiful film wonderfully done. If you enjoy a thinking film I recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="quite suspenseful,if very bleak (3.5/5)"></head><body><p>thought this was a very good suspense movie.there were a number of creepy moments,and thankfully no cheap scares.i also liked the fact that unlike in many of types of films,there are no gimmicky CGI ghosts that look ridiculous.the acting is very good too,especially from the woman who plays the mother.i did think it was bit long though,at 105 minutes.i think they could have stream lined it a bit and knocked off a few minutes.the movie is also quite bleak,a bit too much,except for the very last scene.and as for the ending,i' found it a bit confusing,but maybe it's just me,me,because after checking the boards i noticed many people seemed to have the ending figured out.anyway i'll have to watch it again to see if i can figure out what i missed.overall,i'd give The Orphanage a 3.5/5</p></body></html>

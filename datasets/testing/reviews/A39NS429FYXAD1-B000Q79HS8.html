<meta name="summary" content="Good, not great, sequel!"></head><body><p>Universal puts together great DVD editions with plenty of special features, but SHAME on them for all the advertising they plug into 'em.  That's the major downside to this DVD which is a sophisticated Euro-thriller for the thinking movie goer.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, the direction did not distract me nor detract from my enjoyment of this smart, above average adventure story.  It's not quite as good as the original, but definitely fun and well produced.  Thoughtfully written and beautifully acted by Matt Damon (it must drive Ben Affleck crazy that his best buddy is consistently succeeding in every department of the showbiz store!).<br /><br />The Deleted Scenes explain some major plot points...I don't understand why they weren't included in the final edit....it is not an overlong film (1 hr 49 min).<br /><br />There's a great set up for a third film...let's hope it will deliver the punch of the original and take Jason Bourne back to Europe where his adventures belong!<br /><br />Lots of fun...If you enjoyed the first, you'll at the very least *like* this one a lot.</p></body></html>

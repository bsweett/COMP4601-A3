<meta name="summary" content="A Comedy You Can Sink Your Teeth Into"></head><body><p>The beauty of this movie is that it wraps a social commentary around a gruesome horror movie that was way ahead of it's time. This movie was made during a time when shopping malls weren't as widespread as they are today. Zombies showing up at shopping malls, trained consumers. This movie sets the standard for horror films and it is stunning in every way. The story is great, the acting above average for a horror flick and the special effects incredible. This is a movie that influenced a lot of people and has one of the largest cult followings of any movie. A timeless movie, important in what it has to say, the precedent it set for the horror genre and one of the best movies that intertwines comedy and horror effectively. 5 Stars for the second of George Romero's zombie films.</p></body></html>

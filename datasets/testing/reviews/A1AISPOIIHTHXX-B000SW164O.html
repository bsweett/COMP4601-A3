<meta name="summary" content="I got really confused by this"></head><body><p>Plotwise I wasn't confused by it. It was the direction of the movie. I honestly thought it was a ghost movie. Then there's a point in the film where it could be a creature movie, then a possible stalker movie. Then it becomes something else entirely. Really to blame is the really lackluster script which gives nothing new to the film or even scary.<br /><br />David Callaway and his daughter Emily are just reeling from the suicide of his wife Alison. Wanting to take her out from the house, he moves an hour away upstate. There, he meets some neighbours and everything seems fine. But his daughter Emily is turning rather gothic with vacant expressions, inconsiderate attitudes towards David's new friend Elizabeth and her daughter and starts talking of an imaginary friend named Charlie. At first David dismisses it, until strange things start happening(as usual, right?) and David gets suspicious of this friend "Charlie".<br /><br />That imaginary friend part makes you think of a ghost right? Well so did I. It becomes something else entirely and the "twist" is straight out of something like Secret Window or Fight Club(did I just spoil it for those who've seen those movies?). Not to mention the movie isn't even creepy or scary.<br /><br />I'm not going to blame the actors. Robert De Niro is in that rare category of actors that can emote so much with just a facial expression. He doesn't need big overracted speeches to convey something, he just shows it. And Dakota Fanning is starting to have an impressive resume, that is if you discount Cat in the Hat. She's done better(that shot in War of the Worlds where she gasps from behind the car is far better than anything here) but there's something odd about her where you keep watching. The other characters do what they need to with theirs but don't really go anywhere.<br /><br />I'd take a chance with it. I've seen it and wouldn't recommend it but if you want to, try it out.</p></body></html>

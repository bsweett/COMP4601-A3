<meta name="summary" content="Ill Wind"></head><body><p>Saw this one under duress, since it looked kind of dumb in the trailer, and also the play had such a good performance in it by Cherry Jones I couldn't imagine anyone else but playing Sister Aloysius.  Well, the movie is slightly better than I had hoped.  It is awful in a way, but sticks in your mind even weeks after seeing it, so it must have something, right?<br /><br />It doesn't have subtlety, that's for sure.  The scenes of Meryl Streep battling the wind are more laugh inducing that the combined efforts of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell, and you can throw in the Marx Brothers too.  They must have suggested to Streep that she watch the silent classic THE WIND with Lillian Gish and then ordered her to out-Gish Gish, with some Marcel Marceau thrown in too.  I'm surprised she didn't pluck a flower and smell it, she is so hammy you have to love her.  That, and the lights going out, are movie devices you hardly ever see today, more's the pity.  In fact we don't have enough symbolism about Vatican II in general.  I lived through the whole era, and in fact had an inappropriate relationship with a priest, without any of the wind coming down and whipping our garments around our faces.  And it just gets worse and worse.  At least Streep and Hoffman look like they're having fun, as does Viola Davis, much more pragmatic about letting her son carry on with an older man than my mom ever was, God rest her soul.  Amy Adams on the other hand does more moral suffering than all the actresses in Cries and Whispers combined.  Why she ever took the part I don't know, but it's lousy and so is she.<br /><br />Don't hate me, DOUBT lovers.  I just call them like I see them.  And remember, that was my T-shirt the priest put in my locker, and I've got a right to give my opinion of what was basically the story of my life if I was black and teased.</p></body></html>

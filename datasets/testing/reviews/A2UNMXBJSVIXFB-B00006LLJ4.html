Amazed at how great a film this is, and shocked at why I never bothered to watch it until now. Steven Spielberg has long been a favorite of mine when it comes to directors, and I always thought Tom Cruise wasn't too bad an actor himself. But with that said, Minority Report is an excellent piece of science fiction that works on a number of levels. For me personally, I enjoyed a lot of the film's moral and philosophical quandaries about science in general, its eventual over-dependence by society, the analogies between it and religion, the flaws and doubt of systemization (particularly in law enforcement), and finally, the gravity of our choices and how they can affect the future. Spielberg does a tremendous job weaving all of these issues into a deep enough narrative that gets you thinking, but also manages to entertain, as seen by some of the very sleek action sequences and visual effects. I also enjoyed a great deal of the screenplay and how it dispersed just the right amounts of action, adventure, drama, mystery, and thriller, never faltering and building up to a very satisfying last act. If anything, I just wish the movie were longer and a little more focused on any of the story elements mentioned above as opposed to all of them at an equally sparse level. Regardless, though, it's an excellent movie crafted by one of the best in the business and well-acted by a great group of core actors in Cruise, Farrell, von Sydow, and even Peter Stormare with his brief appearance. Minority Report is a film that, like a lot of science fiction, has more questions than answers, but with a cool and stylish kind of gritty sheen that will probably satisfy serious and popcorn audiences alike.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />This HD master is Spielberg-approved, so who am I to argue? Minority Report is presented by Paramount in absolute pristine fashion. From the very beginning of the film to its end Janusz Kaminski's dark, yet gorgeous cinematography his preserved to perfection. Colors aren't quite as vibrant in conjunction to the film's drab art direction, but I feel they're very representative of the story's nature. Sharpness and image detail also look quite good with a great deal of dimensionality and depth between the actors, visual, and CG effects. But the biggest positives are in the black levels and contrast. Blacks are extremely deep with fine detail between lines and shadows, never losing consistency or getting lost within the photography, thanks in large part to the complimenting contrast. Skin textures, objects, and backgrounds are as good as they'll ever look outside of 3D or holograms. There's also a fine layer of grain providing for a very commendable theatrical look as well, which in some cases reveals some tiny, tiny instances of artifacting and debris, but if you're not even looking for them, it's certainly nothing to complain about. Other than that, there don't seem to be any signs of image enhancement or manipulation whatsoever.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Equally matching its video is a reference-quality DTS-HD 5.1 track. I actually hadn't seen a Spielberg movie on BD until Minority Report, so I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard. The first thing that struck me was John Williams' score (another BD audio-first) and it's subtle, yet immersive presence. It does a good job setting the pace and mood for the film and gives off some excellent fidelity for heavy string and percussion instruments in particular. Dialogue is always clear and understandable from the center channel as well and never suffers from dropout or distortion. In terms of effects, the sound design stays mostly quiet, as a lot of the movie is dialogue. But being the master film-maker Spielberg is, what action and chase sequences he does use manage to really give the sound system a workout. High and low ends for all the technology usage are pitch-perfect, directionality and separation are tight and discernible from one another, and LFEs, while not too frequent, really give the room a pleasant rumble when present. My favorite bit of sound display you could probably use for showcasing would be the Car Factory chase. It represents a little bit of everything from music to sound effects placement to a very cool bass effect in the Sonic Gun he uses to take down some of his pursuers.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />Minority Report comes packed with a lot of the special features from the DVD release as well as some exclusive material in HD to compliment this newly minted BD release. Amounting to almost three hours worth of information, I learned quite a bit from these extras and found it fascinating just how much work went into all the production aspects. Everything from casting and writing, set and prop design, special and visual effects, sound design, music composition, and cinematography are covered to great length. In particular, I really enjoyed the Phillip K. Dick segment and a lot of the comments from cast and crew about the film's production and adaptation. Although, I am a bit disappointed that the film itself doesn't have any kind of audio or P-i-P commentary from Spielberg. But with that said, the extras still offer quite a bit of food for thought.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />Minority Report is another excellent entry into the science fiction genre. In the hands of Steven Spielberg, he manages to infuse a very thought-provoking premise with a fun, action-packed screenplay making for a very entertaining, yet poignant film that brings about a lot of questions in the process. While the narrative isn't quite as focused as I'd hoped for in certain aspects, the film itself is still superbly produced, finely acted, and presented extremely well on Blu-ray by the people at Paramount. With reference A/V quality, a very informative plethora of extra features, and only an SRP of $29.99 (meaning you could probably get it for at least half-ish price), Minority Report comes highly recommended.</p></body></html>

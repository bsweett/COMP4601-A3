For the longest time I thought I was with a select few who appreciated this gothic Sci-fi tale from director Alex Proyas.  Alex Proyas also directed &quot;The Crow&quot; which has a similar ambience.  But &quot;Dark City&quot; is a different animal, altogether.  Take the gothic texture from &quot;The Crow,&quot; add an eerie touch of &quot;Hellraiser,&quot; just a dash of &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; and a vague understanding of this film begins to emerge.  The title character played by Rufus Sewell is searching for his past, constantly pursued by &quot;The Strangers,&quot; and slowly the mystery unfolds.  I've heard some say that they knew what was happening long before the end, but when I saw this in the theater I had no idea what to expect so I let the story play itself out.  Eventually I was rewarded for my patience with a superb plot revelation.  As for the acting, Rufus Sewell is excellent, almost single-handedly carrying the film.  All of &quot;The Strangers&quot; are memorable, particularly the lead characters who bring a seriously evil feeling to these nightmarish beings.  Jennifer Connelly is passable, seeing that she really has nothing to work with here; that, and she can't lip-sync to save her life.  William Hurt is good here, adding a slightly cynical perspective and depth to the grand mystery.  But the eye-sore of the film is Kiefer Sutherland.  He overacts in every scene, apparently gasping for air...between...every...word(or phrase)...he...says.  It gets annoying fast.  As for the visual effects, some are outstanding while others need a little more work.  The look of the movie, from the costumes to the dark city-scape, are all well-thought out and memorable.  &quot;The Strangers&quot; are some of the creepiest creations in recent memory: pale incarnations walking slowly after their prey while wearing long, black trenchcoats and black hats.  More than once they hover and fly through the air, other times wielding switch-blade knives.  All in all, this is a worthy edition to the Sci-fi genre, very nearly (at least in my mind) achieving Cult Film status.</p></body></html>

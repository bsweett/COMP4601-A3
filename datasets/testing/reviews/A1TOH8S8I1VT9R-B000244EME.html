<meta name="summary" content="Sci-fi/Horrer classic worthy of better treatment"></head><body><p>I don't like to reiterate the story (the editorial review and others will do that).  Instead I like to make points on specific details to help the buyer make an informed choice.  Here's what I think are important things to look for and think about when concidering the Predator DVD;<p>THE FILM (for those who have not viewed it)<br />-I have a hard time deciding if this is a horror movie or a Sci-fi film.  It's so violent, I put it with my horror collection.<br />-Did I mention violent?  This film is not for the squeemish.  INTESTINE ALERT!!!<br />-Always compared to "Alien" and deservedly so.  Alien was a more ambitious film.  I rate them as entertainment equals.<br />-Characters are well defined and (despite not talking much) you actually care about them.<br />-Probably Arnolds most appropriate casting.  It is still uncommfortable to hear him cuss.  All the actors are asked to do very little but run and shoot alot... ...with great success!<br />-Special fx have yet to show there age.  Very well done.<p>-There is nary a slow point in the film.  If it gets quiet, it is to build tension.  First time viewing is very intense.<p>THE DVD<br />-If you want to know more about "Pradator" you won't find it here.  This is an "Extras Free" DVD.<br />-Picture quality is very good.  Not a problem,<br />-Sound quality also very good.  Definitly gives a theater feel.<br />-Packaging is simple.  Nothing of special note.<br />-This thing is a cheap date.  You get what you pay for.  I recommend shopping around.<p>So why the title?  Well, I personally feel this is a Sci-fi Horror classic that deserves the same reverence that "Alien" has received.  The film presentation is quality enough, but I certainly would have paid more for "the Making Of.." or concept art or something to educate me on the details of the films production.  I'm glad I'm able to get this wonderful film for the price of dirt, but I don't agree with it being treated like dirt as a DVD package.  Is this film really so poorly reguarded by Fox that it gets the "Shlub" treatment?  Perhaps they plan future releases giving the "Predator" its proper "Special Edition" DVD.  Unfortunately, I've already spent my money on this, highly viewable, poor-mans version.</p></body></html>

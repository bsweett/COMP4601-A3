<meta name="summary" content="A horror-comedy masterpiece"></head><body><p>I can only imagine what fans of the original cult classic, THE EVIL DEAD, thought when they watched EVIL DEAD II. Its predecessor was an eerie gorefest designed for one sole purpose: to scare the living hell out of the audience. That said, EVIL DEAD II is a completely different film. In fact, it has much more in common with a Three Stooges sketch than it does with films like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.<br /><br />The film opens with a re-hash of the first film: young Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) travel to an abandoned cabin in the woods of Michigan. There Ash unwittingly unleashes an evil force which has been lying dormant in the forest - a force which likes to possess human flesh and torment the living. After decapitating his possessed girlfriend with a shovel, Ash struggles to maintain his sanity and ward off the evil force; things become a little more complicated with a group of strangers, led by the daughter of the cabin's original owner (Sarah Berry), wind up fighting for their lives alongside Ash.<br /><br />I was blown away by EVIL DEAD II the first time I watched it. It was after watching it that I came to appreciate just how great a horror film could be. As I've said before, EVIL DEAD II isn't traditional horror. It's horror-tinged slapstick comedy, in the vein of the Three Stooges (of which director/co-writer Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell are huge fans). There's some wonderfully over-the-top stuff in this film, thanks to a wacky script by Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel and some kooky special effects by Mark Shostrom. Joseph LoDuca's score perfectly captures the glumness of Ash's situation, while also capturing the tongue-in-cheek feeling of the film.<br /><br />To me, the greatest point of the film is the camera work. There is some spectacular camera work here: wide shots, distorted close-ups, forty-five degree angles, a point-of-view shot from an eyeball (!). The best camera work in the film occurs through the point-of-view of the evil force (whose form, in a clever move, we never see). The force - and the audience - flies through the forest towards the cabin. It breaks down the door and proceeds to chase Ash through every single room of the house, around winding corners and through doors. It's simply brilliant.<br /><br />While most of the acting is less-than-spectacular, Bruce Campbell's performance is classic. It's no surprise that Campbell is viewed as God by his fans. He is hilarious as Ash, portraying him as a not-so-clever sap with some sharp one-liners. Although Ash (and Campbell) is at his finest in the third EVIL DEAD film - the cult hit ARMY OF DARKNESS - Ash undoubtedly has his moments in this film. Campbell does some wonderful stuff when Ash's hand becomes possessed by the evil. The hand, now with an (evil) mind of its own, decides to torture Ash by smashing kitchenware over his head and making him do some pretty amazing stunts. Finally, in one of the most famous scenes in horror film history, Ash takes care of the hand ...<br /><br />It's no surprise that EVIL DEAD II is the cult legend that it is. It is certainly one of the very finest horror films I've ever seen, and it has been one of my very favorite films since I first saw it. It's a masterpiece, a major improvement over its predecessor. From the fast-paced beginning to the magnificent ending (which sets up the third film), it's a wacky, hilarious ride that no horror fan can miss. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

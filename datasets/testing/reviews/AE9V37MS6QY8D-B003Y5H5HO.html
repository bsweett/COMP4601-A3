<meta name="summary" content="Yes, I surprisingly liked it much more than the original"></head><body><p>Usually remakes pale in comparison to the original, but I really enjoyed this one so much than the original! Director David Fincher (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCZGV8">Zodiac: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P7G">The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000050FEN">Seven (New Line Platinum Series)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U0HBPQ">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (The Criterion Collection)</a>) proves with this that he is right up there with America's best directors such as Speilberg, Scorsese, etc. Screenwriter Steven Zaillian did what most consider nearly impossible -- taking a wonderful film and making an even better updated version. And just when I thought nobody could portray hacker Lisbeth Salander better (or any more of a bad@$$) than Noomi Rapace, then came Rooney Mara! Wow! Her portrayal of Lisbeth elevates the character to "all-time great character" status! The performances are masterful and the story and pacing are just right! The story doesn't pull an punches (nudity, rape scene, sex scene) but it is a must-see for any murder mystery/thriller fan!</p></body></html>

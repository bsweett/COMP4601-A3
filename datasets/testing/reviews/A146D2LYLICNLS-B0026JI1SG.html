<meta name="summary" content="The risks we take to get a shot at our dreams"></head><body><p>"Million Dollar Baby" is simply an outstanding movie, one of those which you won't forget anytime soon after seeing it. I really hope Hilary Swank wins Best Actress. I tend to like Clint Eastwood's directing more than his acting, but in this movie he shows an unusual range and even lets himself cry, something we don't typically see him doing. Morgan Freeman's performance is, as always, great, although his most deeply-felt asset to this movie is his narration. He has such a talent to completely engage the audience whenever he narrates a movie, and this is no exception.<br /><br />What I personally took away from it is that sometimes we must pay a price to reach our dreams, and what lies at the end of the road isn't always what we had hoped for. But it's better than if we never got our chance to have those dreams at all. Mushy and a little corny perhaps, but that's what I believe this movie is about, and it manages to convey this message in a non-mushy and non-corny way.<br /><br />There really is no more praise I can give this film than what has already been said here. Watch it for yourself and just try not to be moved.</p></body></html>

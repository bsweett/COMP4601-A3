<meta name="summary" content="A Cult Classic"></head><body><p>I'll get this out of the way immediately, this is not a film that will appeal to everyone. It is what could be only described as a 'marmite' film. Some will adore its comic irreverence, and some will quite frankly 'not get it'. To me personally this is my favourite comedy of all time, and quite possibly my favourite film in general. I will attempt to not use any of the classic quotations from this film as it will spoil the brilliance of hearing them for the first time.<br /><br />The story is set in a sexist news studio in San Diego, America. The lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) falls for a woman at a party, and she incredibly, to Ron, rejects his not so subtle advances. The next day that very woman, Veronica Corningstone is appointed as a journalist in their very newsroom. Cue brilliant pick-up attempts, witty one liners, emotional breakdowns and scenes that don't leave the mind for weeks. Brick is the lovable fool, who interrupts with odd - yet hilarious - lines at random parts of the movie, he is the weatherman. The sports commentator Champ Kind, is a more roguish persona, who suffers a mental breakdown after Ron decides to go on a date with Veronica instead of attending their monthly pancake breakfast. Yes it's that irrelevant. Bryan Fantana is the 'man on the scene' and is the typical ladies man. All the acting in this film deserves to be noted, they all convey the different personalities of the charchters superbly and somehow without laughing.<br /><br />All in all I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone with an irrelevant humour or in need of something up-lifting, which this film oddly fulfils. A cult classic in the form of Zoolander. Do watch out for the battle scene and a cameo from Jack Black. Pure comic brilliance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not that great of a "last hurrah""></head><body><p>Those of my friends who may think me a Kubrick fanboy need only look to this review to rest assured I am not.<p>I have always been a fan of Kubrick, and I've even stood up for many of his avante-garde or supposedly perverted films such as "A Clockwork Orange"...but I couldn't find myself to like this film. Not only is it dull and boring, but it is extremely perverted and I can definately see why it almost got an X rating.<p>Now you may say, "But its supposed to be from the point of view of the main characters." That may be so, but Kubrick's entered that field before and done it better elsewhere (again, I reference "A Clockwork Orange"). This film is really just a disappointment.<p>Especially since it was the last film Kubrick did. I think many Kubrick fans want to say its good just so that they don't have to admit Kubrick's last film wasn't his best.</p></body></html>

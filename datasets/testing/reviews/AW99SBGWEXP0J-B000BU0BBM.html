<meta name="summary" content="The Brothers Grimm"></head><body><p>Will (Damon) and Jake (Ledger) are the fabled Brothers Grimm.  Although, in this story, they are con-men, travelling the countryside exorcising demons from various villages.  Of course, they are behind the "hauntings", and when they make things right again, they collect the money and move on.<br /><br />Napoleon's minion in Germany, Delatombe (Pryce), discovers what they are doing, and decides to have some fun with them.  He sends them to a village that appears to be haunted for real to solve their problems.  It seems that the 500-year old mirror queen (Bellucci) is casting a spell upon the area in an attempt to regain some youthful looks.  Now, the Brothers Grimm, with the aid of a local huntswoman (Headey) must save the day.<br /><br />"The Brothers Grimm" could have been so much better, but a talented director and cast are not enough to lift this movie off the ground.  The effects and look of the film are good, but the film itself is not very engaging, and when you don't care about the heros, you have a serious problem.  Add to the fact that this movie has been sitting around for a few years, and is part of a movie dump by Miramax before new management takes over, and you have a probable box office flop on your hands.  This movie will find an audience with some, but probably not many.  Wait for the DVD.</p></body></html>

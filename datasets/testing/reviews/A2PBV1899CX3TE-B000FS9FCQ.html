It was playing at the dollar movies, but I don't like going there, people have crying babies and make so much noise they spoil it. When it came out on DVD I went to the DVD store a million times asking for it, but all the copies were checked out. Finally I saw it and it did live up to and exceeded my expectations. It was awesome.<br /><br />Natalie Portman was great (do you suppose that's where Britney got the idea to shave her head?), and Hugo Weaving really conveyed a lot of emotion, even though he wore a mask throughout the entire film. It was cool when he was listening to Getz/Gilberto The Girl From Ipanema while scrambling eggs for Natalie in his Bachelor Pad/Bunker.<br /><br />I heard that the author of the graphic novel upon which it was based disowned the project, but like Bladerunner, it might have been a different story than what the author had in mind, but was a compelling cinematic vision in its own right.<br /><br />This movie worked as an action thriller, with just the right dose of irony, and then on another level altogher, it was a thought provoking film about politics, freedom, and the lack thereof.</p></body></html>

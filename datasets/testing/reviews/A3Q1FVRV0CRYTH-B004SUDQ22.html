Adapted from the play of the same name, `Proof' covers the week following the death of brilliant yet mentally disturbed mathematician Robert (Hopkins).  His youngest daughter Catherine (Paltrow) had been taking care of him for the past five years, sacrificing her dreams of higher education to watch after her lonely and dying father.  After his death she has to deal with his ex-student Hal (Gyllenhaal) who is searching through Roberts notebooks in order to find proof that even in his insanity he was still brilliant as well as her sister Claire (Davis) who never gave either of them the time of day but is determined to help now that their father is dead.<br /><br />What makes this film memorable is the layered performances by the entire cast.  Gwyneth gives a very structured performance, giving us varying degrees of emotions and unraveling her characters inner workings to us gradually.  Anthony Hopkins is such a wonderful treat here, truly mesmerizing, and Hope Davis takes the whole unsympathetic sister role to the next level.  I truly hated her even though I'm convinced she didn't mean any harm.  To me Jake Gyllenhaal is really stepping up to plate.  He had an amazing year last year with three brilliant performances, one of which lead him to an Oscar nomination (all three of his roles, from Brokeback Mountain to Proof to Jarhead were wonderfully layered and all three different from the next making him a true cinematic chameleon).  Although his character is minimal in this film he really commands the screen while he's on and makes for a wonderful treat.<br /><br />While I'm not a mathematician, nor do I even understand half of what made the characters in this film so smart (all that talk of proofs and primes goes right over my head) one can still be enthralled by the underlying and motivating factor to this film.  This is a film about grief and acceptance, especially of ones self, and realizing that we are all capable of great things.  As Catherine deals with the loss of her father whom she no doubt loved very much she also is faced with the idea that she may very well have not only inherited his genius but also his dementia.  And when those closest to you are convinced you're following in his downward spiral you begin to believe in the possibility, almost convincing yourself of what you are certain could never be.  While not as brilliant or emotionally abrasive as `A Beautiful Mind', `Proof' still works hard to strike the right chords, and thanks to impressive performances by the entire cast it hits most of them right on the head.</p></body></html>

Aliens (the 2nd one) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh about how my mother caused M&M's to rain down on the theater after an alien scared her.  So, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  It wasn't scary at all.  People in the theater were actually ***SLEEPING***.  I was jealous of them.  I was mostly glad that this was a short movie.  Sadly, the scariest thing in this movie was a penguin.<br /><br />Don't see this.  If you are a big alien or predator fan and must catch it, wait for video or HBO.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SUPERMAN dares to attempt to touch heart strings"></head><body><p>Okay, I'm a pretty jaded person when it comes to movies. There is a lot of junk out there. More than ever before. Tired of the same ol' same ol. Tired of the excessive ratio of 5-to-1 horror movies shot by your neighbor on the video shelves. Tired of talentless people getting GOLDEN opportunities to star in films and less then average screenplays getting green lit.<br /><br />That being said... I'm not NEAR as jaded as some of these SUPERMAN geeks who are whining about the costume (ENOUGH ALREADY). They've read so many comic books so many times that they can't bare to see ANYTHING altered.<br /><br />That being said. SUPERMAN turns out being what going to the movies is all about. An adventure. Escapism. If you're going into this movie LOOKING for things to complain about, I feel sorry for you. ME, I found myself wrapped up in a film more than I've been in a long time. I felt the dread. I felt the emotional moments. I laughed and I cried (well... I didn't cry, but I welled up once... I'm a new Dad... give me a break).<br /><br />Superman has it all. Most importantly, Bryan Singer (the director), did what a lot of these superhero films are forgetting to do (i.e. see fantastic 4... er, don't), that is, get the audience EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.<br /><br />SUPERMAN's opening sequence sets the stage wonderfully. As his ship crash lands once again in the Kent family farm in Smallville, Kansas, you wonder briefly if we're looking back in time, rehashing, and then his earthbound mother finds him in the wreckage, cradles him and says, "Clark. My son."<br /><br />Many things have changed. Most noteably, Lois Lane is now married with son. Lex Luther is free from prison and SUPERMAN wastes no time realizing that the world was missing him.<br /><br />I won't give away things, because SUPERMAN has surprises. But, I will say that KEVIN SPACEY brings Lex Luther to life. He is phenominal, kooky, funny, insane and dangerous. You feel the dread. You feel the danger in the plan he is concocting. I mean... how to do you defeat the unbeatable man of steel? Well, the creators of this new version of SUPERMAN hooked me.<br /><br />I think, Kevin Spacey, in a lot of ways... made the film.<br /><br />The film is gifted with comedy, nostalgia, action, romance, dread, surprises and heroism, and despite what some are criticizing, this IS, WITHOUT QUESTION, one of, if not THE BEST Superhero movie to come along in a long time. Many of the tactics and techniques used in this film will set the standard for future hero films.</p></body></html>

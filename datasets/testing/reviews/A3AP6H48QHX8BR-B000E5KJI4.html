<meta name="summary" content="Take Immortality It'sYours- This movie may not be immortal"></head><body><p>Troy surprised me based on some of the reviews being portrayed online and the newspaper. Mind you-it's not the best way to spend almost three hours of your life but, it's not the worst either. Rarely is a movie done that guys and girls might both enjoy the guys will love the action fight scenes while the gals will swoon over Brad Pitt.<br /><br />This movie must have cost millions to make with the all-star cast, stunning costumes, the music, and thrilling fight scenes this movie did not fail to impress me and in my opinon it deserved some nodds from the oscars particulary concerning the accuracy and detail in the costumes.<br /><br />I can't believe how many people were critcising the fact that the movie strayed from the "Illiad" personally I thought this was a good thing considering I had to suffer reading that book in high-school. The movie is actually in my opinon better than the book which strains the borriness and pettiness of the Gods who decide the fate of the doomed city. It also was not just based on the Illiad but I saw refrences from the Aenid as well(The Roman version of the Illiad). And yes the Trojan war lasted twelve years I believe and in this it lasts a period of a couple of months.<br /><br />The cast does a very good job particularly from Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Peter O'Toole also did great as King Priam an actually honorable king. I however was not impressed by Orlando and can find the only reason why he has made it into acting is his pretty face. Sorry Girls- he's a model not an actor! But, you will not notice him when you have such performances from cuties Brad and Bana!<br /><br />This movie is all about, love, honor, and immortality. With great action squences and wonderful love scenes- this is a movie to rent on movie night. The only thing I have to critcize about this movie and the only reason this flick didn't recieve four stars from me would have to be the melodramatic screenplay which in my opinon ruined what would have been a great film.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I would rent for movie night, but not buy.</p></body></html>

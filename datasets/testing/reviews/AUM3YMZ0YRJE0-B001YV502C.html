This film is of that kind of quality:  it portrays a future world - an exaggeration of the present - that raises deep questions, is emotionally moving, and full of realistic action that adds to the themes.  In my opinion, this film is on the level of The Day the Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet, but it addresses current crises, from global economic breakdown and emigration to personal identity in a world gone wrong.  I was utterly riveted from the first minutes of the film, was moved at the plight of the mysterious child, and was inspired to wonder at what my children will face.<br /><br />I will try not to play the spoiler, but it is well known that this is about a dystopia that has arisen because suddenly, for reasons that no one can fathom, all women in the world have been infertile for nearly 20 years.  The sense of crisis at the demise of the human race is palpable in the chaos that has resulted:  the economic order is breaking down, illegal immigrants are hunted and forced into lawless ghettos, and human rights no longer exist except for a tiny slice of the elite population.  Gangs roam the countryside, the security apparatus of the state has few civil limits placed on it, and normal citizens are retreating into protected or hidden enclaves while radical activists seek to foment revolution.  My kids were appalled and frightened at this vision and watched with silent fascination, afterwards sparking a long discussion of where the world is headed for them.  We watched it twice, one viewing after the other.<br /><br />The central character, Dylan, is a broken man; he has given up and become cynical about his ideals, drinking for solace rather than contemplating action.  He is watching the world deteriorate around him, losing his empathy and unable to look ahead.  Then, his former lover - the mother of his deceased child - kidnaps him, asking for help.  What ensues is an adventure that renews his faith in humanity and the future, all the while highlighting the brutal machinations of those around him, who want to control what could be the savior of humanity.  He is a normal guy, thrust into what will become greatness.  I completely believed it, to the point that I got choked up at the climax.<br /><br />There are also some excellent commentaries with the version that I bought (2 disks of region 2).  There are documentaries with philosophers (e.g. Lovelock)  and  journalists (Naomi Kline, of whom I am a fan even though I am a moderate conservative) that are quite thought provoking.  Of course, there are also insipid promotional materials ("It was wonderful working with everyone"), but it is worth a look.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.  I see maybe one film per year that enters my pantheon, and this is the one.</p></body></html>

As many have said, there are girls and gore galore, but there's more too. Rodriuguez has given us a sort of homage to zombie flicks while again walking the difficult edge between comedy and horror for almost the whole film. To that end, a lot of the cast are incredibly effective, especially Bruce Willis who (likely intentionally) overacts outrageously, Josh Brolin, and Freddy Rodriguez. Rose McGowan is also near-perfect in her role; a great actor wasn't required, just an effective one. To describe much of the film is to ruin it for someone who hasn't seen it. Definitely worth a watch or maybe two. If you're a Rodriguez fan, just buy it. The extras are nice, too.</p></body></html>

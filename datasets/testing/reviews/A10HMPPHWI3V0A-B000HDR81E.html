Though it's an overall smart plan for a movie it ends up being an hour and fourty-five minutes of constant bickering with an occasional laugh now and then, though the movie itself is overall not to bad, the overall screenplay and plan for the movie was under par, as I said, basically the whole movie was one big screwed over realashinship, that could have been quite comical, BUT they decided to make it more of a drama which ended up making the movie as a whole more a little bit of a swing and miss type of big name film. The glue that really holds everything together in the film is Vince Vaughn is truly the only comic reilef to the film, he is also backed up with a solid but at times boring performance by Jennifer Aniston, the film I would have considered good right up until the end where it really falls apart ...., *Spoiler Ahead*, they end the film on a cliffhanger where it really doesnt let the audience know if Gary and Brooke are trying to get back together, you can tell the director and producers think this is a smart ploy to keep the audience guessing and draw they're own conclusion, but honestly, to the audience it ends up looking like they didnt know what to do in the end or how to put together a good proper ending, so really it ends up looking like quite a fiasco of a mess...<br /><br />Solid all around acting, not a bad idea for a film but trust me when I say that this is not your prototype summer blockbuster comedy with to big name actors, what I thought was going to be good its up being somewhat of a dissapointment....<br /><br />Go and see it for yourself because the movie got alot of mixed reveiws from not only the critics but also sthe audience, it's not a failure but its definatly nothing speacial or great..<br /><br />Overall: C</p></body></html>

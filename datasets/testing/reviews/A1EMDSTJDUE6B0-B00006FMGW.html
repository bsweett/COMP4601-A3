<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie"></head><body><p>Although this movie is about 20 minutes longer than most, it keeps your attention. Not in an action-packed way like a typical summer blockbuster and not a real intellectual movie, it is a good combination of action, intelligence and the unexpected. To know that it is fact-based only adds to the drama. Hanks does a good job, as he almost always does. DiCaprio outdoes his normal acting and has moved himself up a level (although this is certainly not as popular a movie as his other ones that won him recognition). This is also a good movie for dates.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Great Film!""></head><body><p>John Travolta and more star in Quentin Tarantino's<br />1994 crime thriller. Three tales center around 2<br />hitmen, a boxer, a crime boss and his new bride.<br />This is a great film featuring a cool cast that's<br />definitely one of Tarantino's best. This 2-disc<br />set not only has good picture and sound, but<br />neat extras. I highly recommend this.</p></body></html>

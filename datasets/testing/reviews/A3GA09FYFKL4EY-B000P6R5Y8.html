<meta name="summary" content="NOT what I expected"></head><body><p>Parents should be aware that this movie is NOT a fantasy/sci-fi film despite the way it's being marketed. I think the studio decided that most viewers would have read the book before seeing it, and therefore decided that the somewhat-misleading campaign was okay. I'd be very angry if I had watched it with younger children. If you are hoping for a "Chronicles of Narnia" "Wizard of Oz" or "Harry Potter"-type film, STAY AWAY!<br /><br />This movie is entertaining for adults and teens, with its fabulous tales of make-believe and the dilemma we can all relate to - children fleeing bullies and the cruel world that is public school - but tragedy keeps it from being a real family movie. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 12 or 13. I expected to see a fantasy movie, and this was anything but.<br /><br />The best thing about "Bridge to Terabithia" is not its terrific special effects, or even its story, but the fabulous performances from its youthful stars. I hope to see more of them in the future, and hope they don't get lost in Hollywood's child-star mill.<br /><br />But, again, it is NOT a film for children. A friend compared his family's experience to him bringing a puppy home for his kids and then shooting it in front of them. This is most emphatically NOT a movie to share with your children, unless you want to see them cry bitterly - and NOT remember the movie with fondness afterwards.</p></body></html>

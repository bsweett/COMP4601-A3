All the way up to the revilation scene, when Robert Neville (Will Smith) finds out that he isn't alone and quite frankly, I AM LEGEND fell completely off the table and crashed into a million pieces.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND had a premise that we've scene hundreds of times. OMEGA MAN. 28 DAYS LATER. You can't be out after dark. Zombies, or forms thereof. The only survivor of an incredible catastrophe. Yet, what it didn't do, is anything different. When you thought it was going in a cool direction and you were seeing something completely new and a completely original twist on an otherwise overused premise, you realized... nope... same old stuff. Nothing worth remembering.<br /><br />The scenes of Will Smith racing through the baron, littered and grass covered streets of New York City, hunting deer and avoiding Lions were top notch. The scenes of him using the video store as a social outlet, with strategically placed mannequins, were well done and poigniant. The scene where he reluctantly followed his dog into the shadowed building that housed the infected humans were frightening.<br /><br />Everything was going so well... and when Neville used a trap to capture one of the infected and then the infected turned the tables on him, instituting their own trap, I was sold. That was followed by some heart-wrenching moments and a confrontation scene that was creative and realistic. I AM LEGEND was right on. A memorable, hit movie. And then....<br /><br />I AM LEGEND became just another movie. There were characters introduced that broke the movies rhythm. Anna & Ethan? They're clean. Calm. They appear out of nowhere, but have no knowledge of what happens after dark. She manages to save Neville from an onslaught of infected, but then shows no sign of being battle or survival tough.<br /><br />There are moments where the audience isn't allowed to play along, like when the infected find Neville's hideout. It is explained by a single line of dialogue and has little to zero impact.<br /><br />Ultimately though, I AM LEGEND started off unique and just became forgettable and uneventful. When a premise has been done hundreds of times, it's time for a shakeup... something new... we didn't get it with I AM LEGEND. We got 1 hour of unique moments followed by 40 minutes of the same old same old.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Patton"></head><body><p>George C. Scott delivers a towering rendition of the profane, colorful, contradictory Patton, by turns making us admire, revile, and pity this man, who was driven by a profound sense of pre-destination. Karl Malden is superb as Patton's more measured but equally brilliant colleague General Omar Bradley, but this is Scott's show all the way. This won a raft of 1970 Oscars, including Picture and Actor. A must-see.</p></body></html>

CGI in an of itself is no longer enough to intice the families into the theatre.  The huge success of "The Incredibles" was not in the excellent CGI work, but in the fact that the story could have worked just as well with live actors.  Good script, good dialogue, and good acting really do make a difference.<br /><br />However, the studios that churn out these CGI vehicles on a regular basis don't seem to have noticed this.  They think that if you get some big-name talent for your voices, throw in a little slapstick, some toilet humor (for the under-10 crowd) and some hip pop culture references (for the parents slowly dying in their seats), then you have the makings of another blockbuster.  Certainly this movie ultimately will show a modest profit for the investors, but if I recall correctly, the box office results can be charitably described as tepid.<br /><br />When we watched it, the kids were, at best moderately engaged by the movie.  They've seen enough CGI so that it is no longer a novelty.  There just wasn't enough in the movie itself to hold their interest...the characters were either uninteresting or annoying, and the storyline meandered too much to hold their interest.  Suffice it say that the adults would have rather been doing anything else than enduring this.  Echoing other reviewers, everyone liked the penguins, but that is hardly a recommendation for the movie as a whole.<br /><br />I would not consider buying this movie, as I doubt the kids would watch it more than once.</p></body></html>

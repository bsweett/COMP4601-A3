The difference:  This movie is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.  The script balances heart-pounding action with funny one-liners that always make me laugh out loud.  Bruce Willis is wonderful as the Rambo-esque superguy who outwits, outplays, and outlasts the heavily-armed killers, and reveals just enough of his tender side to endear his character to the audience.<br /><br />Willis is backed up by outstanding supporting players who add depth and surprises:  Reginald Veljohnson is the sympathetic cop Willis talks to via radio during his ordeal. Alan Rickman plays the cruel, urbane gang leader with devilish flair.  He is assisted by the talented Alexander Godunov as a ruthless killer.<br /><br />The production values are top quality, the action never stops, and each stunt is unique and utterly stupendous.  I heartily recommend Die Hard to those who love action films and those who just love excellence in film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ok movie"></head><body><p>I liked the music, the nature was amazing - love watching the nature in these western movies<br />John Wayne's a great actor but the attitude he stands for is spoiled. George W Bush ruining of the cowboy image was one of the damages he made and Wayne characterizing the obstinate bully mentality that Bush took was not pleasant to see. I always liked Wayne but having seen this movie I see that while he's still a good guy and I like him, the cowboy mentality as exhibited by Bush is bankrupt. Also I didn't like the spirit of the movie which constantly had conflict as part of it - obviously all these characters were  in conflict w/ themselves else they'd know a more peaceful way of relating (not talking about komancho vs white but just between and within whites too)</p></body></html>

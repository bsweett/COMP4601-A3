<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful world (and a wonderful Blu)..."></head><body><p>Honestly, whether one hates or loves the film, I do not see how this entire package cannot be rated other than a five star Blu. You have a two disc set that contains a 2D, 3D, DVD copy, Dig Copy, an hour of special features in 1080i, Dbox, and the usual mix of BD Live options from Universal.<br /><br />I watched this with my kids both that are under 10, and contrary to what anyone says as a shock tactic, this movie was not a horror flick. It was a great animation film with a solid story that looked outstanding on Blu. Having both copies readily available, I compared several scenes to prove the vibrancy, colors, and clarity were greatly improved with BD, even with it being this type of animation. The 3D version loses the usual color palette, but looked great compared to other 3D out of late.<br /><br />The DTS was mixed eloquently, and more times than not they managed to use all five channels with much more frequency that can be done with a live action film. So after enjoying a fun film (ignore the naysayers here) we spent an hour going over the supplements.<br /><br />The making-of lasts 36 minutes and contains many smaller features that do have the Play All option. After watching the Voicing Of (10:46), the strangely edited deleted scenes (8:47) and the Creepy Coraline (5:30) segment I almost side with splitting between the features that you find the most interesting. The deleted scenes are bizarre in how they edited in the director's facial contortions and the ten 1-2 seconds blips as "needing to be cut" - whatever. Some great information either way regarding the time it took to make certain sequences. Have not had a chance to utilize the DBOX option or the BD live features for this one. The usual Universe U Control option is available to you if your player is all tuned up for doing the PiP and such.<br /><br />The clarity, colors, sound, supplements, and extra copies all make for a worthwhile product purchase, especially for as low in price as it has gotten in the last week. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

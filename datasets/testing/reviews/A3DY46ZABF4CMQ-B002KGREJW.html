In the midst of all this mess, the family has a chance to redeem itself and start acting...well, normal!<br /><br />I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. It's a comedy that doesn't present itself as satirical or a farce. It works well with the excellent cast (I expect some Oscar nods, especially for Collette, Arkin, and young Breslin), funny dialogue, and road setting.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

Though I think it could have been trimmed a little bit for length and pacing, I did find it to be a well made movie with some great work by Emile in his role as Christopher.  Emile is quite the young actor, in the roles I have seen him in he seems to be very chameleon like.  His characters are always very diverse and he really seems to get into his role.  This movie is no different.  By the movie's tragic end, he has gotten himself so skinny, it is uncomfortable to watch.  The Eddie Vedder soundtrack is great and perfect for this movie with the call of nature and hippie characters.  What you get out of the movie will come from how you perceive Christopher.  He is either a caring optimist with bad parents who wants to embrace the beauty of nature and reject the evils of civilization.  Or you may see him as an arrogant, spoiled rich kid who throws everything away for some unrealistic goal that he is unprepared for.  I thought it was a good movie based on a great book.</p></body></html>

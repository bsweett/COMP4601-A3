<meta name="summary" content=""Bad fish. Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This shark, swallow you whole.""></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg's first and perhaps greatest masterpiece (of many) also epitomizes the summer blockbuster. His screen realization of JAWS (1975), Peter Benchley's bubblegum novel of a giant shark lurking in the waters off a fictional Massachusetts resort island, occurs during a July 4th holiday weekend.<br /><br />The three main characters are somewhat clich&eacute;d, but the talented actors portraying them manage to keep these men from being laughably cartoonish. Roy Scheider plays a transplant from NYC, the sheriff of an island town surrounded by water who's terrified of the ocean. Richard Dreyfuss is a boy genius icthyologist whose family wealth allows him to turn a hobby, the study of sharks, into a career. Robert Ryan is the crusty sea salt with a tragic past that comes closest to caricature; comparisons to Captain Ahab are apt.<br /><br />By story's conclusion, Ryan joins his prototype in death, the boy has become a man nearly eaten by the Great White he tried to poison, and Scheider learns he actually likes the sea. But what brings them to these ends is unforgettable cinema, and the reason this film was the blockbuster of 1975, a phenomenon that has yet to be equalled in public hysteria and popularity.<br /><br />John Williams' famous score is one of his best, subsequently imitated yet never topped. His music enhances on-screen action and helps turn what could've been an average monster movie into a screen classic.</p></body></html>

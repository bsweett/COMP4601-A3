Strangely I feel everyone of us can in some way or the other relate to certain feelings of mixed emotions. I think the direction in this movie stands out and the characters are just very interesting and un-movie like. There's no exaggeration whatsoever used to describe the story. It has some really amazing music being played throughout the flick. I've seen it once and I cant wait to give it a second watch.<br /><br />I dont think Garden State can be ignored. I'm not going to say its different because nearly every movie made nowadays is different. This one stands out cause its somehow very serene and enjoyable. I simply love the actress for her true to herself nature that never comes out. Never quite comes out.<br /><br />Go Watch it.</p></body></html>

It has a hidden meaning that children will not get. Its very clever and only really comes out of hiding towards the end. In a way, the subtle message regarding the environment is a good thing, but its a shame it has to be disguised in a children's cartoon.<br />The songs are mediocre at best and the penguins come across as likeable, but really, it doesn't have much going for it. Its certainly a watchable movie and does have its fun moments, but really, its almost too adult in certain ways for children to truly appreciate it. But I am sure most kids will like it as is too.</p></body></html>

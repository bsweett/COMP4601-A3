<meta name="summary" content="Welcome back Terry Gilliam"></head><body><p>Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the Brothers of the title, look like they really enjoyed themselves making this movie, and whereas that's a good thing, it does take away from some of the picture. This is the first movie that Terry Gilliam has done since Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) and is a return to some of the more fantastical elements of his imagination, and directing skills. Most of his movies have either been disastrous, or remain cult classics with his fans, and hopefully this will be a welcome return to the big screen, and the box office.<br /><br />The story is an interesting twist on the famous fairytale authors, suggesting that the Brothers fed on the fears and superstitions of local peasants back in the 1800 and something's, by showing up and ridding the folks from demons, witches and the like with their own magic and exorcisms. The fact that they provided the "false" spirits in the first place through inventive (for the time) magic shows and props, was just incidental to the fact that they were heroes making an honest living. All seems well until the arrival of Jonathan Pryce as a warring French General in the region of occupied Germany where the brothers are working, who arrests them for being charlatans, and makes them a mafia style offer. They can either stay and be tortured to death by his henchman Cavaldi (brilliantly comic performance by Peter Stormare, piled high with pathos) or investigate the disappearance of all the young girls at a nearby town, on the edge of an enchanted wood. Pryce believes that someone with a similar MO to the Grimms is up to no good, as do the Grimms themselves, until they arrive, and actually see things that are more than hard to explain.<br /><br />The banter between Damon and Ledger is great, Ledger being the younger more imaginative sibling who makes notes on all their travels (hinted at being the famous fairytale bible) and Damon more rational and grounded. It will of course take a combination of them both, and the local knowledge of the fetching Lena Headey as Angelika to solve the mystery.<br /><br />I never felt like this was a big budget picture, the locations are fairly grim themselves, with rain filled muddy streets in small villages, and a forest made on a sound stage, but the overall effect was a real treat. Gilliam injects enough "magic" into the picture without being way way "out there" as you felt in movies like The Fisher King, and Baron Munchausen, and supports the maxim, that less is more.<br /><br />I won't spoil the story; it's inventive, funny, a little spooky in places for younger viewers, and cleverly laced with many references to the many and varied much loved tales of the famous authors. Go see for yourself, chances are you'll have fun. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

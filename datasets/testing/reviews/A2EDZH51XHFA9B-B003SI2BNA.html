It's like an alien EMP washed over the set and clicked everyone's brains off, turning Dark Water from an intelligent, scary film into the kind of preprocessed pablum that Hollywood horror films have been made of, in bulk, since I Walked with a Zombie. (For the record, there is almost no doubt in my mind that the hand of producer Roy Lee was far more involved in the final fifteen minutes of this film than the first ninety.)<br /><br />So I'll do my best to concentrate on the first ninety minutes of the film when writing this review, because you really should see that part of it. After that, turn it off and go rent the original Hideo Nakata film from 2002, which has a far more satisfying ending to it. Besides, you should see all of Nakata's movies, which are uniformly brilliant.<br /><br />Salles (Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries) and Yglesias (Death and the Maiden) took Taka Ichise (To Sing of Love)'s original script (based on a short story-- not a novel, as both the film and IMDB mistakenly tell you-- by Koji Suzuki, the guy behind Ring) and did a good deal of work on it, which may be the first time since the remake craze began that a script has really been reworked to an extensive degree by a top-notch screenwriter. The end result was good enough to lure some pretty big talent, and it all comes together quite well for an hour and a half.<br /><br />Dahlia (Requiem for a Dream's Jennifer Connelly) is presently going through a divorce from her husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott, from the highly anticipated upcoming TV series Heist) that's getting nasty. Caught between the two is their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade, of the TV series Invasion). Kyle is moving to Jersey City; Dahlia can't afford that, so she goes looking at project-style apartments on Roosevelt Island. Murray (Gangs of New York's John C. Reilly), a slick used-car type, tries to sell Dahlia on a one-bedroom in a building Ceci describes as "creepy," but by the time they've finished looking at the apartment, Ceci desperately wants to live there. No sooner have they moved in than odd things start happening, all having to do with water.<br /><br />Connelly, Scott, Gade, Reilly, Pete Postlethwaite (The Constant Gardener), Camryn Manheim (The Tenth Kingdom), an utterly unrecognizable Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs), and an even more unrecognizable Elina Lowensohn (The Wisdom of Crocodiles) all turn in wonderful performances in this movie. (Well, okay, every time you see "this movie" from here on out, add "the first ninety minutes of" beforehand.) The only constants are Connelly and Lowensohn, who plays her mother in flashbacks (the two of them constitute a kind of good-and-evil matrix around whom the rest of the film revolves); everyone else is a variable, and all of them play their variability exceptionally well. The horror-film aspects of what's going on (which become readily apparent within the first half-hour, but I still won't spoil them for you if you haven't seen the original)almost take a backseat to the far more human drama of Dahlia's life, both in the present (the divorce, her harrassment at the hands of a couple of stoner punks who live in the building) and the past (flashbacks to the hatred and ultimate abandonment she suffered at the hands of her alcoholic mother). As it should be.<br /><br />Those of you who have seen the original will no doubt have realized by now that much of what I'm highlighting in the remake was nowhere to be found in the original. And this is what makes the remake of Dark Water such a potentially great film; while it kept the trappings of the original, it is very much its own beast, and Yglesias' script seems almost as if he read through Ichise's original a few times, read Suzuki's story a few times for good measure, then sat down to write the horror version of Kramer vs. Kramer, but without the gratuitous JoBeth Williams nude scene. (Which, I feel compelled to add, Dark Water suffers for lacking.) It's an Yglesias script more than it is an adaptation of an Ichise script, and Yglesias is a great scriptwriter.<br /><br />Of course, none of this holds for the movie's final quarter-hour, which exists solely for the purpose of throwing an a whole bunch of cool special effects, and has none of the atmosphere, pacing, and feeling of denouement as the last quarter-hour of the original script does. If you overlook that, this is a film well worth your time. Unfortunately, it's impossible to overlook. ** ?</p></body></html>

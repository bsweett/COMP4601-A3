Who wouldn't love a rollicking yarn set in the glorious adventure hey-days of pre-WWII?  With intrepid heroes with intrepid names like Joseph "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) and Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) engaging in derring-do against a dastardly villain and his titanic robotic minions, what could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />Suffice it to say that for the first ten minutes of "Sky Captain" I was enchanted.  A glorious scene where the Hindenburg III flies through a snow-storm to dock atop the Empire State Building, with various and sundry characters looking gravely concerned and on the verge of panic sets the stage for both grandeur and a suitably sinister plot.<br /><br />What a let-down!  The movie quickly devolves into a murky plot involving some kind of invasion and some kind of plot involving super-secret scientists.  And the performances by this normally-stellar cast are uniformly wooden (with Angelina Jolie the lone exception as the delectable, one-eyed Commander Franky Cook) -- it's almost like George Lucas was in charge.  For actors such as Law, Paltrow, and Giovanni Ribisi to have so many flat, empty scenes is just shocking.  This is a movie where gigantic robots invade New York City, for Pete's sake, and yet in most scenes the actors deliver lines in sotto voce, a soft deadpan that is completely at odds with what is happening around them.  Why bring in the radiant Jude Law and make him act like a young John Gielgud?<br /><br />The plot of "Sky Captain" also has a lumpy, amorphous feeling to it.  Despite a wonderful set-up, we are denied much of an explanation of what is going on, and the "unique condition" of the villain denies us any climactic confrontations between good and evil.  For a movie that deals in such broad characterizations, this is a surprising twist that doesn't work.  Also, the villain has one interesting henchman - an acrobatic female assassin -- who ultimately fails to deliver on her awesomely diabolical potential.  She is no Darth Maul!<br /><br />All in all, Kerry Conran and team have made a landmark film with "Sky Captain," but only on the technical side.  The movie is easily one of the best-looking films I've ever seen, and there are several scenes of considerable imagination and craft.  And yet Conran's bunch was unsuccessful in uniting their amazing vision with the human craft of acting.  The movie feels disjointed, and you can almost picture the actors performing in front of a blue-screen against imaginary backdrops that will be added in later by CGI.  Disbelief cannot be suspended, and as a result, the movie fails.<br /><br />Worth a rental, "Sky Captain" is not essential for any movie library except for its technical expertise.  Here's hoping that Conran and team get another shot at using their amazing technology to tell a great story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Entertainign Horror Film."></head><body><p>Now while this film is cheesy and is a little bit of a cliche. I really did like it. I thought it rocked, OK. I really dig on Rob Zombies music, so I figured I would like his movie and I was right. It was funny and gory. Rob Zombie proved that not only can he sing, but he can write and direct a decent horror film. All of the cast is great, especially Zombies wife Sheri Moon. She is HOT!!!!!!!!!! She alone could make the film worth watching. The movie is about 4 teenagers traveling across the country who run into a family of sadistic killers which include<br /><br />Baby (Moon), Otis (Bill Moseley of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"), Mother Firefly (Karen Black), and Grandpa (the late Dennis Fimple). Eventually (and this is now a classic horror film cliche) everyone is killed off one by one. This is where Zombies imagination kicks in. If it is a horrible, dire way to die. Then it most likely happens in this film. Sid Haig adds some comic relief as Captain Spaulding. Spaulding runs Captains Spauldings Museum of Monsters & Mayhem...Fried Chicken & Gasoline. The main menu is hilarious. Just watch that before u watch the movei. I was laughing really hard. Look for the sequel "The Devils Rejects" later this year. B.</p></body></html>

I tend to look at the relationship aspect of films, and in my eyes, the romance between Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) was lacking. On the set, no one knew whether Ilsa was supposed to truly love Rick or not which caused Bergman to play the part ambiguously.<br /><br />However, I finally realized that the relationship was strong because of Rick's love for Ilsa. It didn't depend on mutual affection at all. With this revelation, I was able to see the film for what it was: a masterpiece.<br /><br />Rick own's Rick's Cafe, a seedy bar in Casablanca during WWII. Casablanca is still free from Nazi control, though Nazi leaders swarm the streets. This makes it a place filled with refugees hoping to escape to America. Of these refugees is a leader against the Nazi's, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He brings his wife to Rick's, the beautiful Ilsa. It throws Rick into a tailspin; the two have a lot of history and he's been brooding over her since she left him. From there, he begins to act rather uncharacteristically.<br /><br />No one can deny the cleverness of the script; AFI recognized many of the lines in it's 100 Years 100 Quotes... list. Also recognized in an AFI list is the theme song "As Time Goes By." Thanks to Casablanca, it has become a standard. This is no surprise because it is a beautiful song, and Dooley Wilson's vocals make it very charming. Max Steiner's score is wonderful as well.<br /><br />Overall, this film has a little bit of everything, but blends each seemlessly. There is history, intruige, romance, great dialogue, and excellent music. If that were not enough, on this edition of the VHS is a 20 minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall.</p></body></html>

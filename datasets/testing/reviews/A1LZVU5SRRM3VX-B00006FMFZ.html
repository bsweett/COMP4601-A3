<meta name="summary" content="Tom Hanks' Sensitive Gangster Can't Carry This Stinker"></head><body><p>I knew it was a bad sign when I kept glancing at the DVD timer while watching this.  The pacing of the film is so incredibly slow that a person can take extended bathroom or snack breaks, leave the film playing, and not miss substantive plot developments.  After the first hour, I know I did!<p>Hanks' sensitive gangster is about the only glimmer of interest in this otherwise lackluster film that is so in love with its visuals that it forgets to include more than a rudimentary plot.  A forgettable film in many respects.</p></body></html>

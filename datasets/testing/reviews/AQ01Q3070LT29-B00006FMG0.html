I was very disappointed by this Tom Hanks/Paul Newman movie.  I will say that Tyler Hoechlin did a fine performance and I hope we will see him in other films as he becomes mature as an actor.  It was good to see Paul Newman in a movie again even though he does play a "heavy".  Seeing Tom Hanks as a "heavy"/father sends chills up my spine, however one of his early films, he did play a murderer.  It was a terrible movie to watch, but it did hold my interest.  The DVD contains many deleted scenes which I thought some should have been included in the film.  Many scenes with Jennifer Jason Leigh were cut out.  Interesting production notes.  Best to watch this film in the standard version.<br /><br />  Tyler Hoechlin went on to be a regular in the tv series, "7th Heaven" (1996-2007) as "Martin Brewer" from 2003-07. Recently in Hall Pass (2011) and is in the MTV tv series, Teen Wolf.</p></body></html>

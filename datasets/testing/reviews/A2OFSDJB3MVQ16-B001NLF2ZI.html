<meta name="summary" content="Sidney Pollack's last film is a good thriller"></head><body><p>This film would be, unfortunately, director Sidney Pollack's last. Boasting a cast of Oscar winners (Kidman and Penn), and a slightly convoluted story, "The Interpreter" is also gripping entertainment. Pollack begins his story in South Africa with the killing of 2 journalists and then segues to the UN where Kidman as an Afrikanner interpreter works.  As the story slowly unfolds, we find that her knowledge of a planned assasination could put her life in danger and that's where a cynical FBI agent (Penn) comes in to check up on her story.  What begins as a tentative relationship between the two slowly unfolds as they become intricately involved but without actually having a consumative relationship which marred Pollack's own "3 Days of the Condor" (I could never buy the relationship between Redford and Dunaway).  In this era of short attention spans, Pollack should be applauded for taking his time in developing these relationships as well as slowly involving us in their dilemna (the slight twist near the end was nice).  This film is a fitting testament to the legacy of Sidney Pollack who also uses the widescreen format to excellent effect here.</p></body></html>

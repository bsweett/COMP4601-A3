After the seance I was pleasantly surprised. I saw "Scream 3" some days ago and that movie wasn't nowhere near scary as "What Lies Beneath". Great performance by Michelle Pfeiffer (she looks really gorgeous in this one) and Harrison Ford. The climax is absolutely terrifying (especially the bathtub sequence). Plenty of suspence and shocks, wonderful atmosphere of dread and fear. Finally after never-ending strain of lame slasher flicks a truly suspenseful movie. Check it out if you dare.</p></body></html>

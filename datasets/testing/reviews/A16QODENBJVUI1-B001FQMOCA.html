<meta name="summary" content="An excellent biopic driven by superb lead performers"></head><body><p>In watching WALK THE LINE I couldn't help but be struck by the parallels between Johnny Cash's background and that of my mother.  Like him, she was raised in a small Arkansas town (albeit in the hills in the northern part of the state rather than the delta area) in a somewhat rustic house and was often called upon to join her family in picking cotton.  And like Johnny Cash, in an effort to find a better life left the small town she grew up in for Memphis (though she later relocated to Little Rock).  So, this is a movie that is very much about my kind of people.<br /><br />The parallels between WALK THE LINE and last year's RAY will be obvious to everyone who has seen both films.  Both deal with Southern-born musicians who struggled with drugs before eventually kicking the habit.  The romantic parallels are not so sharp, but the relative period of their success was close.  Johnny Cash was not the musical innovator that Ray Charles was, but both achieved a place close to the hearts of Americans.  Interestingly, it was Johnny Cash, the white Arkansan who achieved crossover success as a country performer who was involved in more liberal causes, while the black Floridian Ray Charles was a Republican.  I mention this just to highlight what ironic and unusual paths people's lives can take.<br /><br />The film covers the life of Johnny Cash roughly from his early childhood until just before his marriage to June Carter.  In talking to friends, I have been amazed that even those who have seen the film were unaware of June Carter's background, and when I mentioned the Carter Family they were not clear on who they were.  If there is a First Family in American country music, it is the Carter Family.  Along with Jimmy Rodgers, they were the most influential act in early country music history, and those two along with Hank Williams are the genre's greatest musical influences.  Formed by A. P. Carter, Maybelle Carter was his sister-in-law and one of the most important influences on American guitar finger picking, developing the walking bass note that is fundamental to music ever since.  When A. P. and his wife divorced, Maybelle took over the group, involving her daughters in what was essentially the second version of the Carter Family.  June was one of those daughters.<br /><br />Before their deaths June and Johnny Cash gave their blessings to this production and gave final approval to the performers who would play them.  On the acting end of things both performers are simply outstanding, and both fully deserve the Oscar nominations both have received.  Reese Witherspoon is simply adorable as June Carter, generating more charisma than one could think possible.  She is much shorter than the real June Carter, but since Joaquin Phoenix is much, much shorter than Johnny Cash, giving away about a half a foot, their heights are not terribly disproportionate.  Both performers worked vigorously on their singing in preparing for the film.  Reese, especially, does a good job with her singing.  She doesn't capture that snarl that made June Carter so much fun to listen to, but she nonetheless does a very credible job singing.  Phoenix gives it a great try, but how could any actor be asked to emulate Johnny Cash?  It simply can't be done.  Johnny Cash had one of the few great bass voices in popular music and even though for the most part he sang in a baritone range, there was always a depth and deepness to his voice that undergirt all he did.  And when he did need to drop down for those low, low, low notes, he did so effortlessly.  Phoenix simply can't pull it off. It really isn't his fault at all.  No other actor I know of could have done any better.  He does, however, at least pull off a lot of the rambunctiousness of the young Johnny Cash.  My daughter when in junior high bought a poster of the young Johnny Cash and put it in her room.  It shows Johnny Cash leaning forward from the stage towards the audience, almost savage in his demeanor, pointing one hand towards someone in the crowd, middle finger extended in an obscene gesture.  As he aged, perhaps calmed by his relationship with June it became more difficult to discern that wild man, but Phoenix certainly captures much of that.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good movie and I enjoyed every aspect of it.  My only serious regret is Phoenix's singing.  This is unfortunately not a peripheral matter.  Johnny Cash possessed one of the most unique, marvelous voices of his generation, and having anyone play him who cannot absolutely nail the singing would be a mistake.  It would be like having someone play Frank Sinatra.  You have to get the voice.  Still, it would be a hard person who couldn't find a great deal in this film to love.  And if for no other reason, one has to see this simply to see how precious Reese Witherspoon is.</p></body></html>

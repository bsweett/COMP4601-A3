<meta name="summary" content="Shutter Island (2009)-OK, but it has all been on film before!"></head><body><p>Shutter Island (2009) with Leonardo DiCaprio was a tremendous dissapointment to me. For its nice cinematic and fine camera work I rate it at 4 stars, very good acting 5 stars, and basic story only 2 stars.  I guess it was because of the many TV spots and DVD commercials promoting this film and the fact that it starred Leonardo DiCaprio that I was especially dissapointed, as I expected something much better.  This movie substituted mental illness for a good mystery, as have so many films going back to the late 50's, but especially since the mid 90's which have all made mental illness a fairly common theme or sub-theme. I did not like or enjoy this plot and I actually felt cheated when everything was explained, once again, by a simple case of insanity. It is just not fair to build up what the viewer believes to be true and then switch all the ground rules. I guess I should have rented it before buying it.<br /><br />I love surprise endings which are earned by the story, as in Vertigo, Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable, but this film just cheated.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A brutally great film"></head><body><p>This is a far different sort of comic book movie. It is more serious and important than any other's that I've seen. And more intelligent. Its not just about action sequences and explosions (though there is that). It deals with real issues, sensitive issues. It really makes you think. V is a great character. Beneath his mask, you can tell that he is in pain, physically and mentally. He really is unique and a completely different type of 'hero' than I've ever seen. Hugo Weaving did a great job in portraying emotion without ever taking off the mask. I truly think everyone should watch this film.</p></body></html>

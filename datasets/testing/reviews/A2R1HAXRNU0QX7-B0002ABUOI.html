<meta name="summary" content="IT DELIVERS!!!"></head><body><p>I can't give the film 5 stars because it's no SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or CITIZEN KANE.  Also, it gets docked because the original idea came from George Romero, and these filmmakers are putting thier own spin on it.  But other than that...this movie delivers chills, thrills and more than a few solid laughs.<p>I'm a fan of the original, but I haven't seen it in years.  Of course, the special effects in the original weren't so great compared to what we can do today (or frankly, to what Romero did in DAY OF THE DEAD), but I actually remember the original being grosser.  When the zombies caught someone in the original, we got to see disembowlings and lots of chewing on flesh.  YUMMY!!  In the new movie, there isn't time to dwell on it so much. It moves at a brisker pace than the rather long original (it was nearly 2.5 hours if I remember, compared to 100 minutes or so now).  <p>Anyway, surely you know the basic plot by now! Flesh-eating zombies are rising from the grave and making more zombies faster than you can say "nuclear holocaust."  They can only be killed by a shot right through the brain (or perhaps being burned completely) but most people are killed before they have a chance to even try killing the zombies.  A few survivors make their way to a shopping mall, and barracade themselves inside.  The zombies are constantly threatening, but as is often the case in such films, the bickering and power-struggles of the survivors are nearly as dangerous.  Who will live?  That's the ultimate question.<p>The important thing in movies where we take a large cast and kill them off one by one (ALIENS...good,  DEEP BLUE SEA...not so good) is that we learn to care somewhat about the characters. And the movie has VERY little time to sketch the characters, so they have to handle it well.  DAWN OF THE DEAD handles it very well.  Each person is given sharply drawn characteristics, and just enough complexity that we immediately throw our allegiances their way.  Even the "bad guys" have their moments.  In the end, we hate to see ANY humans, even the nasty ones, succumb to a zombie.  And most of the characters get at least one good laugh to their name...so we like them for that!<p>The nominal "lead actor" in the film is Sarah Polley, a nurse, who is the only one of the band of survivors that we meet BEFORE the zombies take over. In a brief, maybe 10 minute, opening, we see her at work, coming home to her suburban town and cuddling with her husband. All around her, little clues about the brewing trouble are being dropped, but we also see very easily how she could be missing them...so imagine her surprise to wake up in the morning to find the world she has known is gone forever.<p>Polley is a good actor who has never gotten big Hollywood recognition because she isn't a traditional beauty.  But, much like in the original DEAD movies, there aren't really any pretty faces in these films.  The aestetic is to give us BELIEVABLE looking people...people we might see on the street.  US!!!<p>Ving Rhames is the other "big" name, along with ER's Mekhi Phifer.  But being a "name" in this movie is no guarantee of making it to the end.  <p>Part of the fun is guessing who's next to go.  And just about every death is different than any other, so that we get to "experience" each loss.  Thus, the movie is brutal, but it feels a bit human too.<p>The action scenes are all tense and well-executed.  And the biggest success of all:  no moments where you say to yourself, "Oh, come on, NO ONE WOULD DO THAT!!!"  There is one case where one of the characters does something VERY foolhardy on her own (involving chasing a dog) but by then, we KNOW that she is a person living on the edge of sanity as it is, so we buy her doing something stupid (which she doesn't pay the ultimate price for anyway).  Otherwise, these are desparate people, often forced to do insane things because they have no choice...not because they made stupid choices.<p>I really enjoyed myself at this film, and if you're a fan of in-your-face horror, you MUST check it out.  It's nice to know that this kind of movie can still be made so well.  With 28 DAYS LATER and now this great remake...it's been a good couple of years!</p></body></html>

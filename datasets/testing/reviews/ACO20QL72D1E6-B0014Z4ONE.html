<meta name="summary" content="The Temple of Doom... the best of the series"></head><body><p>The 81 film is a build-up and the 1989-film showcases River Phoenix and Sean Connery to great advantage(River even performed his owns stunts...)<br /><br />But the best is "The Temple of Doom"...It borrows its premises from old  cheap serials, but here it is given an all-stops-out production treatment and a great performance from the future Mrs Spielberg, Kate Capshaw. The opening number is mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm as well:-)))</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Houston, we have a GREAT MOVIE here.  Do you copy?"></head><body><p>+++++<br /><br />This movie is a dramatized version of the real life near-tragedy of Apollo 13.<br /><br />Apollo 13 was the third mission to land men on the Moon and the Apollo program's first aborted mission.  An explosion in one of the oxygen tanks crippled the spacecraft during flight.  The Lunar Module (used only to land on the Moon) was used to provide emergency propulsion and life support after the loss of the service module system.  The crew was forced to just orbit the Moon and return to Earth.<br /><br />Here are the facts of the Apollo 13 (AS-508) mission:<br /><br />(1) Lunar Module: Aquarius<br />(2) Command and Service Module: Odyssey<br />(3) Crew: Commander Jim Lovell, Command Module pilot Jack Swigert**, Lunar Module pilot: Fred Haise<br />(4) Launch: April 11, 1970<br />(5) Landing site: near Fra Mauro (one of the Moon's craters)<br />(6) Returned to Earth: April 17, 1970<br /><br />** The initial pilot Tom Mattingly was removed 72 hours prior to launch due to presumed exposure to German measles.  (He later flew on Apollo 16.)<br /><br />Director Ron Howard has taken these bare facts (and the book "Lost Moon" co-authored by Jim Lovell who served as technical consultant on this movie) and made an unforgettable adventure, drama, and history movie using state-of-the-art special effects and ingenious movie-making techniques.<br /><br />There are actually three stories in this movie:<br /><br />(1) The astronauts struggle to stay alive<br />(2) The controlled chaos at NASA who try to solve the numerous problems caused by the explosion<br />(3) The trauma faced by the astronaut's families<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Tom Hanks as Lovell and Ed Harris as Mission Control Director Gene Kranz give especially good performances.  Also look for the fine performance of Gary Sinise as bumped astronaut Ken Mattingly.  Ron Howard does not make the mistake of letting the special effects upstage these terrific performances.  (Ron Howard's real-life mother also has a role in this movie.)<br /><br />Another highlight of this movie is the actual historical news footage that was used.  Look for people like Neil Armstrong (the first person to set foot on the Moon in July, 1969) as well as Jim and Marilyn Lovell among this footage.<br /><br />The movie ends with Hanks as Lovell summarizing the "seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13" and he ends his summary with this statement:<br /><br />"I look up at the Moon and wonder when we will be going back and who will that be?"<br /><br />Finally, the anniversary edition DVD is flawless with respect to picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.  The most notable extra is that the entire movie is also presented in IMAX.<br /><br />In conclusion, be sure to see this incredible movie and see why it was nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture!!<br /><br />(1995;  2 hr 20 min;  widescreen;  2 discs)<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

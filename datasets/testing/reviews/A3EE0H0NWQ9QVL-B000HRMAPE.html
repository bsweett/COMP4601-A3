<meta name="summary" content="Unrelenting Chase"></head><body><p>`Mission Impossible: 3' is a chase marathon.  An explosive adventure filled with wild goose chases--and just plain wild chases--this globe trotting adventure will please anyone not interested in seeing characters catch their breath.  The plot is opaque, but uncomplicated:  To avenge the death of colleague, Lindsey (Julie Harris), Ethan (Cruise) finds little time to consummate his honeymoon after taking vows with Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and, instead infiltrates the Vatican and Shanghai to catch his nemesis, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Thomas) an arms dealer who will use a coded item (nicknamed a "rabbit's foot") to sell sensitive weapons to the Middle East.  Finding treachery in his intelligence organization and a villain who kidnaps his newly wedded wife make for some nail-biting adventure.<br /><br />Although familiar in its pyrotechnics and chase scenes, 'MI:3' remains a formidable adventure.  And though we've seen the hero blackmailed by his kidnapped wife many times, the danger often remains palpable.  Tom Cruise gives the third installment some urgency, and Laurence Fishburne as his tough, tart-tongued supervisor, Theodore Brassel, bolster the formula for this action outing.</p></body></html>

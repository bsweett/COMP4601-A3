What is all the complaining about? How is this film anything but good? Sure it does get a little cheesy at points, hence why I docked it a star, but for the most part I enjoyed this movie immensely. After the disaster that was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMZK">AVP - Alien Vs. Predator (Widescreen Edition)</a> I was really looking forward to seeing this film take a bad franchise that had promise and fulfill its great potential, and IMO they did just that.<br /><br />The predators from the fist AVP are on their way home after a good hunting trip when suddenly they come under attack in their own ship by a alien/predator mix. The ship crashes in the remote forests of Colorado (why does it seem like every horror movie takes place in Colorado these days anyway?) where it is discovered by a father and son who are hunting. Unfortunately for them there are face huggers in the ship who make a meal of them (well not really a meal, but you know what I mean). The aliens start reproducing in the woods, slowly at first, but as time goes by there are more and more of them, and they have their sights on a nearby town. Meanwhile back at the Predator home world a Predator has received a distress call from the downed ship and immediately flies off to subdue the aliens who've been released on earth.<br /><br />The characters in the film aren't really that interesting; there's the troubled teen that just got out of jail, the younger brother of the troubled teen who likes getting into fights, the girlfriend of the younger brother of the troubled teen, and the cop who's friends with the troubled teen. Not too confusing. Also there's a soldier who's just arrived home after serving in Iraq. She's been away a long time and her daughter barley knows her. The characters aren't really that important to the story overall though, just as with most horror films the action is what's important not the people involved. I can handle that.<br /><br />So let's talk about the action real quick. We have the old favorites, people being skinned alive by Predators, Aliens killing people with their mouth inside the mouth tong thing, and even a swimming pool death that was pretty cool. The difference is that the killings in this film are a bit more personal. Not only do the small kid and his father get it, that was bad enough, but the aliens reach a hospital and infect (for lack of a better word) a room full of newborn babies and a pregnant woman. Really freaky stuff. There are characters who you'd rather see live that get it in a very honorific way that will have you yelling "oh come on, just let her/him live for goodness sake. You can't kill him/her." The street fighting between the aliens and the town's survivors is pretty neat and thank goodness there is no alliance between the people and the Predator, in fact the Predator seems just as inclined to kill people as to kill aliens.<br /><br />Its not a perfect film to be sure, the teenage romance thing always gets under my skin (no pun intended) and he whole military cover up was a bit much, but I enjoyed the film for what it is, flaws and all.<br /><br />Word of the Day.<br /><br />Acidate; a-si-date, in past tense it sounds likes 'acid ate it'. When a character, be they Predator or human, gets alien blood all over them and then slowly melts we say they are being acidated. A really useful word to have while watching any Alien movie.</p></body></html>

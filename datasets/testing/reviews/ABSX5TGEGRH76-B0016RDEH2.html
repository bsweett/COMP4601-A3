<meta name="summary" content="Possibly the Best Film of the Year"></head><body><p>Where do I start with this movie?  Pan's Labyrinth is a marvel of modern filmmaking.  From the enchanting story to the beautiful visuals, Guillermo del Toro's latest film is a modern masterpiece.  Set against the backdrop of post-civil war Spain, a fascist regime has come to power.  Those who don't obey the law are subjected to terrible punishment.<br /><br />Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is a girl who likes to get wrapped up in fairy tales.  They serve not only as a form of entertainment, but more and more, she uses them as an escape from the harsh realities of what has become of her home.  The film begins as Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to the Spanish countryside to reunite with Carmen's second husband and Ofelia's step-father Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez).  Vidal is a firm believer in the fascist government; he follows orders without question and expects those below him to obey him.  When Ofelia arrives, she finds a rock with a design of a king carved into it.  When she examines it, a large dragonfly emerges.  Later, Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;), one of the house-maids at Vidal's cottage, points out an old labyrinth on the edges of the estate.<br /><br />After settling in, Ofelia sees the dragonfly again, and learns that it is in fact a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her through the labyrinth where she meets the Faun (Doug Jones), who tells her that she is a reincarnated princess of the Underworld.  The Faun gives Ofelia a magic book that will reveal three tasks she must complete in order to return to her kingdom.<br /><br />As she goes about trying to accomplish her tasks, Vidal and his soldiers attempt to stamp out the local resistance movement, which is the reason they are stationed in the cottage.  His preoccupation with erradicating his enemies overshadows Carmen, who is getting sick from the pregnancy.  In a moment of sheer vileness, he calmly tells the doctor attending to her to save the baby if he must choose between the two.  Vidal's cruelty is sickening; he brutally killed a father and son he believed were part of the resistance, only to find out moments after they were dead that their stories explaining why they had guns was in fact true.  During a torture sequence with a stuttering guerrilla, he mockingly told the man that he would be set free if he could count to three without stuttering.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ofelia's tasks take her to fantastic places filled with dangerous and terryifying beasts including the Pale Man (Doug Jones), a cannibalistic humanoid with eyes in his hands.  Her interactions with the Faun are both beautiful and creepy; the Faun is terrifying yet gentle and Ofelia's lack of fear around him is interesting in that she is petrified of her step-father, Captain Vidal.  As the movie continues, the real world and the Labyrinth begin to come together, ending with a wonderful climax.<br /><br />In addition to the great story, the visuals and sound are phenominal.  The creature effects, especially regarding the Faun and the Pale Man, are incredible, and the costumes and set designs are beautiful.  The sound usage is incredible.  Most sounds are accentuated, from the squeeking of the leather in Vidal's uniform to the opening of umbrellas, seemingly trivial sounds break the silence of the times without any dialogue, of which there are many.  However, the scenes without dialogue add just as much to the story as even the most verbose sections of the film.  The characters' varoius motions and mannerisms speak volumes about them.  But possibly the most essential use of sound in the film is the haunting lullaby Mercedes hums to Ofelia.  There are no words to it, and the melody, which is supposed to help people sleep, is beautiful and haunting.<br /><br />If there is anything I would change about the film, I would add more scenes in the Labyrinth.  Every scene in the film is essential, thus no scene can go.  I would gladly sit through another 30 minutes of film to see more gorgeous scenes of the fantasy world.  If a film's only problem is that it wasn't long enough, that is an amazing compliment.<br /><br />This is one of the best films of 2006 (it was released in the US in 2007, but will be counted for the 2006 Oscars), and deserves every Oscar it is nominated for.  This film is a modern classic and a perfect fairly tale for adults.</p></body></html>

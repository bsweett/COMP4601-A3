<meta name="summary" content="appaling, racist, politicaly incorrect, and downright ugy. one of the funniest films of the year"></head><body><p>Borat is your everyday Kazahki news reporter. his sister is fourth best hooker, his neighboor is a jerk, he has a retarted brother, and he has the oldest mom in his village at 43 years of age. when he is assigned to make a documentary about the "US and A", what follows is a absolute hilarious romp through america that ranges from ediquette parties, gay parades, antique stores, nude wrestling, hyoer religious seminars and even the purchesing of a bear. after all of the reviews, i simply had to see this film and boy i was not dissapointed. the is definently one of the most funniest comedies i have seen in a while and it is the best raunchy comedy since American Pie. Cohen's character of Borat is simply comic genius, he can milk any laugh out of his character by the most simpliest of actions. not only that but the situations are practically golden, each one garunteed to get a laugh out of you. i have to say, this movie is definently not for everyone. there is tons of full frontal male nudity, some pretty fowl language, extremly racist jokes, and some downright low brow humor. but, if you dont care about all of that and just want to see the movie even more, then Borat is the one for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bill Murray's finest hour"></head><body><p>I have seen most of Bill Murray's films and I generally love most of them. With all of those great films, I consider Groundhog Day his best and it is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. Bill Murray is at his greatest in this movie because herein he channels all of his talent into the role of Phil the jaded and bitter weather man from a Pittsburgh tv station.<br />The story is a simple one of redemption and changing the path one's life is on and Murray takes this relatively simple and perhaps predictable plot line and delivers a charming and engaging performance that is never maudlin, never exaggerated and never phony. As the repetition of the day continues, Murray's Phil transforms from frightened non-believer, to scheming opportunist, to crazed suicidal maniac, and finally to a man who finally understands why this bizarre circumstance is happening to him. The movie is never heavy-handed or preachy. It is subtle, introspective, and genuine. This is a perfect vehicle for both the earlier Stripes version of Bill Murray as well as the latter day one that did so well in Lost in Translation. This gem is truly one of those eternal movies that can be watched for generations to come as you do with the really great ones. Like the crazed reality of Phil's situation, Groundhog Day can be experienced over and over and over again and always satisfy.<br />Groundhog Day is a movie that touches your soul as well as your funny bone, and makes you feel alive and inspired. How many movies do that and are this heartwarming and fun?<br />As for special features, I buy dvds because I want to see the movie, not because I want to watch a bunch of interviews, play games with my dvd remote control, or listen to commentaries. If they are there and they are worthwhile, so much the better, but if they are not, I still am glad I own the movie and the lack of special features would never alter my decision to buy a movie. Groundhog Day is worth owning in whatever format you can find it. Just thought I'd throw that out there....</p></body></html>

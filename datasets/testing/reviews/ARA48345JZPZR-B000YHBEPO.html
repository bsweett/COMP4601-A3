BUT, it does entertain.  What the hell?  This is supposed to be Impossible Missions time and J.J. Abrams, Tom Cruise and company hit the deck running and barely let up to take a breath and throw in a little plot exposition.<br /><br />Opening with a very clever flash-forward that lodges the hook and we're off as Ethan Hunt, out of field ops., is about to marry a civilian unaware of his IMF life.  But a mission to rescue a former trainee of his gets him and the audience into not only a thickening plot but also into high gear for what becomes one smartly directed, choreographed, and edited action scene after another. The pace is unrelenting.<br /><br />This is action movie stuff to the IIIrd degree if I may say so, and it is done with real movie smarts and a healthy budget. Cast and crew did their jobs well.  It crackles and I was able to ignore the obvious leaps of logic and sit back and enjoy a rip-roarer done with style.  I had fun, but then I like good action flicks.  If you don't, you shouldn't go.</p></body></html>

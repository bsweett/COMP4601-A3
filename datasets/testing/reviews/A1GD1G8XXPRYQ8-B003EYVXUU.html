Anyway, somehow I added it to my wishlist. I got the movie and months later finally decided to try it. I had been expecting worse, so when I saw that it was almost two hours long, I sighed. I wanted to make it quick and watch some other movie. I had been skipping a first few parts in the movie, because I found them uninteresting, boring. Because of pathetic little boy and his miserable life. Anyway I skipped a little in the movie. Until the girl came into the picture. Then it just caught me. I was watching it with questions on my mind, I was hooked by how good the movie actually was. It was thrilling and entertaining and bit of drama as well. I was  upset when it actually ended. I wanted to see a little more. But I am amazed and surprised and pleased by the whole plot of the movie. I didn't expect to see that, but that was just wow, nice work!</p></body></html>

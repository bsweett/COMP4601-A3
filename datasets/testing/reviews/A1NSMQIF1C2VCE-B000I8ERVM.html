<meta name="summary" content="Great concept, pity the rest is a mess"></head><body><p>The basic concept and structure of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is sound -- a murder trial for an exorcist, intercut with flashbacks letting the audience see the events first-hand -- but they're buried under a mess of a movie.<br /><br />Strangely, this slapdash movie feels like the sort of original movie aired on Lifetime. If, you know, Lifetime aired stories about demonic possession.<br /><br />In this case, the terrible dialogue, written by someone I can only assume has never actually spoken to an actual person before, almost totally distracts from the wooden acting. What sort of drugs were given to a cast that includes some fairly dependable actors to turn them into listless zombies, I can't guess.<br /><br />Absolutely skippable, especially if, like me, you think the premise and structure sound really intriguing. The reality of the final film just proves all the more frustrating, in that case.</p></body></html>

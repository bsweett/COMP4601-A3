<meta name="summary" content="Not your typical "happily ever after" flick, but still a great film!"></head><body><p>I like Vince Vaughn and I like Jennifer Aniston, so I figured I'd probably enjoy "The Break-Up." However, I really did not expect this movie to be as good as it is. It's excellent!<br /><br />As you can probably tell from the title, this film isn't exactly a romantic tale. It's actually a very dark comedy about Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston), two very different people who fall in love, move in together, and then decide to split up. Neither of them are willing to vacate their posh Chicago condo, so they're forced to live under the same roof with each other in the wake of their very nasty break-up. Brooke and Gary go to great lengths to torment each other. Gary treats Brooke's friends like outsiders and turns the living room into a pseudo-strip club, while Brooke taunts Gary with her naked body and parades her various dates in front of her ex. Ultimately, both characters are forced to come to terms with their relationship, and the outcome probably isn't what most movie-goers will expect.<br /><br />I was very impressed by the performances delivered by Aniston and Vaughn. There are definitely some funny moments in this movie, but the subject matter is actually quite painful, and Aniston and Vaughn do a great job of portraying their characters' heartbreaks. The supporting cast of "The Break-Up" is also outstanding. I especially enjoyed watching Justin Long and Judy Davis play Brooke's crazy co-workers from the art gallery: hilarious!<br /><br />"The Break-Up" is a great movie because it's so incredibly realistic. I've personally witnessed many couples deal with the same problems Gary and Brooke have. I'm sure some people will complain that this isn't a traditional "happily ever after" love story, but not all relationships work out in the end. Also, I think the ending to the film can be interpreted in a variety of ways, and either way you look at it, I think Brooke and Gary both wind up happy in the end, which is nice.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and will definitely watch it again...maybe I'll even buy the DVD!</p></body></html>

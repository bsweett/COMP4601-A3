<meta name="summary" content="In this case, revenge tastes like week old leftovers"></head><body><p>Everybody loves Ocean's senior member, Reuben, so when Vegas  Willy Banks cheats him out of their casino partnership and causes Reuben to have a heart attack, the Ocean's team get back togetehr for revenge.<br /><br />This should be great.  They've got another big stakes heist on a Vegas casino. Oh, and the dastardly Terry Benedict from "Eleven" has even joined the team because he wants to break the "Banks" as much as the Ocean's team does.<br /><br />So, why didn't it work?  Too much detail and too much setup.  You're wiped out by the time the real action happens and while you want to see poor old Reuben get his own back--it just doesn't seem quite worth it at the end.<br /><br />I'm glad I only rented this film and didn't see it at the theatre.  I'd strongly suggest anyone who hasn't seen it and wants to rent "Thirteen" before buying it.</p></body></html>

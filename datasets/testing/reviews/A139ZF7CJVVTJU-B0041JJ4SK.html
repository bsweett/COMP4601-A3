It's not great (nobody there is claiming to be a gourmet chef), but it gets the job done.<br /><br />"Harold & Kumar" works in a similar fashion. Another stoner-buddy comedy (owing as much to Cheech and Chong as it does to Chapelle's "Half-Baked"), this movie takes the road-trip/quest concept (which, as the title suggests, is essentially just one huge plug for the fast food chain) and uses it as an excuse to string together a series of sketches on weed, women, and ... racism?<br /><br />The movie is chock full of stereotypes, but don't worry; they're so self-aware that they do everything but wink at the audience. From the hyper-religious freak (who happens to have a smokin' hot wife) to the rude and crude eXtreme sports dudes (one of them is actually called "Extreme Sports Punk #1"), we are given something cliched, and then it is spun on its head (the boil-covered religious man turns out to be big on group sex; the eXtreme sports dudes ... well ... they have interesting taste in music). If there's one thing about "Harold and Kumar" that works, it is its happy subversiveness.<br /><br />But is it funny?<br /><br />That's hard to gauge sometimes, especially when you're talking about a movie that relies so heavily on boob shots. Harold and Kumar, in addition to being hungry for bite-sized, steam-cooked burgers, are also always up for a toke (in fact, their Castle quest is inspired by the munchies), but these guys don't ever really seem all that high (a state of mind which would give more credibility to this weed-obsessed movie). Instead, they're actually pretty smart and clear-headed. On the other hand, the rest of the film is SO cartoonish and weird (vengeful cops, placaple cheetahs, college chicks who play grotesque toilet games) that the gags only work about as much as a typical Bugs Bunny joke, if Bugs had a joint in his mouth instead of a carrot. Granted, Bugs is pretty funny, but only when he's not trying to make a point.<br /><br />In the same way, this movie is spot-on when, like Bugs, it goes for the wistfully irreverent (e.g. Anthony Anderson's wistful and blustering Burger Shack employee), the playfully vindictive (e.g. Neil Patrick Harris as himself-on-E), or the just plain absurd (e.g. Jamie Kennedy's hilarious cameo as a creepy guy in the woods). It's all well and good that the movie wants to make a point (or two), but instead of going for the hazy epiphany (like stoners are wont to do), this flick should've just stuck with the giggles and the bloodshot eyes.<br /><br />This DVD comes with a plethora of special features. Highlights include the deleted scenes (some of which aren't bad at all), and the outtakes (which are good as well, but a little short).</p></body></html>

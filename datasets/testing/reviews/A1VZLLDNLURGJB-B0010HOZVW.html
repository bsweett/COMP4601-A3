<meta name="summary" content="The Brave One - You can never be the person you were"></head><body><p>The Brave One was an excellent film which deserves a five star rating. Besides the very excellent action story featuring an abundance of action and violence, this story has a lot to say about never being able to return to who you were prior to being made the victim of a violent crime.<br /><br />The story makes a convincing case for the idea that extreme trauma almost always prevents one from returning to that innocent "person", or possessing that tranquil state of mind he or she believed they were in prior to being a victim of violence.  That person is dead and gone, always replaced by a new person having no "illusions" or ideals about safety, truth or justice.<br /><br />The question is how to proceed from that point on. The idea that revenge and violence is inescapable is troubling, but I don't believe it to be necessarily true as Jodie Foster's character emphatically did. Nevertheless, this story was a chilling and exciting roller coaster of a film and I recommend it for all fans of action movies as well as wonderful Jodie Foster.</p></body></html>

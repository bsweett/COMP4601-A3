<meta name="summary" content="Very surprised to learn that Elmore Leonard had a hand in this plot"></head><body><p>Get Shorty was one of the greatest comic crime movies of all time, created from the Elmore Leonard novel of the same title.  In fact, the movie introduced me to Leonard's unique brand of crime fiction, and I have been a fan ever since.  Upon seeing Be Cool, I was dismayed that Leonard didn't have a hand in it...and then imagine my surprise upon finding out that he did write a follow-on novel that the movie was based on!  It seems like we're missing all the macro-scale comic justice of a Leonard novel, and instead just getting some cheap laughs with an all-star cast.<br /><br />I will admit that there are some unforgettable characters in here, namely Vince Vaughn as a wanna-be black gangster, and The Rock as a gay Samoan bodyguard.  Uma Thurman is beautiful, to be sure, but she's not in her prime like Rene Russo and Gene Hackman were in the original movie.  John Travolta's performance is, of course, spot-on.  It's like Leonard wrote the character of Chili Palmer for him.  No one else could pull of the gangster-smooth charm with old-school movie and music knowledge.<br /><br />The sequel pays homage to the original in several scenes, namely Chili's renting of the "Cadillac of hybrids" and two scenes in which bad guys break in and alert the homeowners to their presence by turning the TV or stereo up.  For hardcore fans of Get Shorty, this is worth a viewing, but it isn't a masterpiece like the original.</p></body></html>

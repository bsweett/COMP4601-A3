<meta name="summary" content="Fun, entertaining, but too long"></head><body><p>"Ratatouille" is a technical tour de force, as one would expect from Pixar.  On top of that, the characters are well-drawn (pun intended) and interesting, and the story is engaging - hallmarks of Disney animation.  And, of course, this is a funny movie.  This film is billed as a comedy, and it does not disappoint on that front.<br /><br />However, "Ratatouille" has pacing problems, and one villain too many.  The first segment of the movie lasts way too long for the amount of exposition it provides, and could have been left out altogether.  Indeed, it's interesting to watch the deleted scenes and see how Brad Bird initially planned to start the movie in Paris - a choice that probably would have benefitted the movie.  And with two villains, there comes a point 20+ minutes from the end when you abruptly think the movie must be over - but it just keeps coming because there's one more villain to deal with.<br /><br />Nevertheless, "Ratatouille" will entertain both adults and children, as Disney films always do, and is at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

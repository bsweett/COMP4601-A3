<meta name="summary" content="The Most Enjoyable Film of Last Summer"></head><body><p>It is now obvious that when you want a super-hero film that takes place during World War II, the man to turn to is Joe Johnston.  First the highly underrated  "The Rocketeer" in the summer of 1991, and now the best super hero film of the summer of 2011.  Most people know the story of Steve Rogers, the 98 lb weakling turned into a  super-soldier by a scientific experiment.Created by the legendary Jack Kirby and Joe Simon before the U.S. officially entered the war, this film is fun and exciting from start to finish.  Chris Evans, the "Human Torch" from the Fantastic Four films is great both as 98 lb. Steve and super soldier Steve.  Tommy Lee Jones is a riot as a Pattonish Colonel that Captain America serves under.  British actress Hayley Atwell is beautiful in 1940's style make-up and hair design as the British officer assigned to the Captain America experiment who winds up being Steve's nominal love interest and Hugo Weaving is appropriately nasty as the Captain's nemesis, Red Skull.<br />As stated the action is fast and furious and the patriotic spirit of WW II is captured beautifully.  There is a nice patriotic musical number, "The Man with the Plan" starring the good Captain and a group of dancers probably representing the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, played during the Captain's war bonds tour.<br />The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are fine.  There are numerous not very long "making of" segments and one featuring the story of the Captain's origin.  There are deleted scenes and a much longer segment of the scene at the end where the Captain first meets Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury that is far better than the scene actually used in the film.  The music by Alan Silvestri is fine and the end-credits include patriotic posters, most of which were probably actually used during the war.  This just adds to the film's obviously patriotic feeling.<br />I looked forward more to "Green Lantern" last summer and greatly enjoyed it.  However I enjoyed this film more.  (If you enjoyed Director Johnston's work on this film, check out the previously mentioned "The Rocketeer"  I'm sure you will enjoy that one as well.)<br />And now we can look forward to the good Captain joining Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and others in the "Avengers" film next May.<br />And if you haven't already seen the film in the movies, stay to the absolute end of the credits for more on the above.</p></body></html>

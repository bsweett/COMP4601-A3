He's enjoying the notoriety that superhero status has given him, gloating about all he has done for humankind in the past few years. Actually, his behavior seems out of control, and personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is increasingly frustrated by Tony's self-destructive antics. Little does she know that the palladium core of the arc reactor Tony wears is slowly killing him. Meanwhile, the US government is demanding that Stark turn over his Iron Man suits to the Defense Department. And a new rival, Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is building his own arc reactor to avenge an old score.<br /><br />The "Iron Man" franchise continues to distinguish itself from other films based on Marvel Comics characters with its sense of humor. These are action-comedies that, perhaps ironically, also have the strongest socio-political subtexts. Leave it to Robert Downey, Jr. to play crazy, funny, and heroic at the same time. Sam Rockwell is an inspired, not necessarily obvious, choice to play Stark's arch-rival in business Justin Hammer, CEO of a rival defense contractor. Director Jon Favreau has done a great job with the visuals and managed to find the right tone as the film vacillates between high-octane action and slightly hammy comedy. "Iron Man 2" isn't as strong as 2008's "Iron Man", partly because introducing the SHIELD organization into the mix creates too many characters.<br /><br />I'm not a reader of comic books, so the introduction of characters from other storylines seems odd to me. I understand that comic books do this a lot, but it can be problematic in a 2-hour film, where maintaining focus among a change of CEOs at Stark Industries, a sinister plot involving a Russian scientist and rival businessman, a crusading senator, a military friend who may be foe, a drunken and desperate hero, and a lot of explosions already presents a challenge. Scarlett Johanssen is probably fine as SHIELD babe Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, but I can't say that her action scenes were convincing. Other than that, "Iron Man 2" is a lot of fun and is happy to be over-the-top in everything it does. And its sly jabs at the defense industry are pretty funny.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2010 single disc edition): The single disc offers an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau. He talks a lot about his decisions, what he chose to do or not to do and why, the reason for the sequence at the beginning of the film, themes, what was included or had to be left out. It's a good commentary if you're interested in directorial decisions or cutting. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French. Descriptive video service (DVS) is also available in English for the visually impaired.</p></body></html>

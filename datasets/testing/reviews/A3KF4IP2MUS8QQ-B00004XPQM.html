Heck yeah, as long as you have a great cast, great writing, and a talented director.  Great special effects are just the icing on the cake - and this franchise can always be counted on to deliver some of the gnarliest deaths imaginable, from the simple to the most elaborate and cinematic.  Watching this film, you can't help but reflect on the fact that there are a bazillion ways to meet your death every single day, no matter how careful you are.  It's a wonder we live as long as we do.<br /><br />It has been exactly one year since Flight 180 blew up on takeoff - and all of those who accidentally survived began their twisted tangoes with Death, who doesn't like to have his plans altered by sudden premonition-based acts.  Only one of those survivors still lives - Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), secluded inside a padded cell.  Now another young person, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook), has a terrible premonition of her own while waiting to get on a crowded freeway.  Rather than being thankful, most of the people she saves with her actions complain about the whole experience and scoff at the obvious similarities of the events of last year.  Of course, these people soon begin dying in noticeably bizarre ways.  This time, though, Death seems to be working backwards - as if trying to find a way to cheat Death again wasn't enough, Kimberly and the others have to figure out what kind of game Death is playing this time around.  Kimberly seeks advice and assistance from Clear Rivers, the great Tony Todd ramps up the macabre atmosphere of the circumstances in a wonderful cameo, and the inevitable debate over free will vs. fate among the survivors becomes academic rather quickly.<br /><br />There is a nice level of complexity to what could have been a pretty simple storyline.  Those who escaped the freeway pile-up at the start of this movie are not as random as they would appear, as there is a very special link that ties them all together.  This sequel also introduces a new survival plan for those on Death's overdue appointment list - you have to have hope, you know.  Anyway, Death and the filmmakers would seem to have spared no expense when it comes to delivering little cinematic masterpieces of destruction that manage to impress even when you see them coming.  With the exception of one rather cheesy demise, the film showcases a number of a gory, ingenious, and (if you're as sick and twisted as I am) darkly comical deaths.  This really is a great series of films that could have gone south in a hurry with the first sequel.  Instead, Final Destination 2 is every bit as good - if not better - than the original film.</p></body></html>

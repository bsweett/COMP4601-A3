<meta name="summary" content="Possibly THE WORST Movie Ever Made!!! 2 Hours 49 Minutes Of F-Bombs. What A WASTE Of Talent."></head><body><p>I wanted to see this film just to see what the big deal was about this film being called "The Greatest movie ever made." Baloney (and that's putting it very mildly). This film is simply a waste of time & talent. 2 hours, 49 minutes of f-bombs spewed everywhere. I don't mind watching a movie with profanity & violence, but there's got to be a good storyline to go with it (the "Lethal Weapon" movies, for example) This movie was utterly a waste of my time. I ain't seeing it again. The Greatest Movie Of All Time?!!! B.S.!!! "Beauty And The Beast" is the greatest movie ever made (I grew up watching it, so naturally I'm in favour of it). I love "Gone With The Wind" & I personally think all the classics (and "Beauty And The Beast" is certainly a classic) are much better, both enrtertainment & moral-wise, than this 2 hour 49 minute p.o.s. Maybe "The Godfather" films are also better than this (at least those movies also have coherent storylines, not just a smattering of f-bombs). Rated R for non-stop strong profanity strong incessant violence throughout, and brief nudity.<br /><br />This movie is not only too long for its own good, but is excessive on the violence, profanity (over 200 uses of the f-word and several other strong profanities, both in English and Spanish) and drug use (almost every scene shows Tony snorting cocaine). Plus, there's a gratutious scene of a naked woman. I have no problem with R-rated movies, but the excesses here are just too much for me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, not great"></head><body><p>This is a perfect example of style over substance in a motion picture. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; could have been the screen equivalent of Stephen King's &quot;The Stand,&quot; or at least as suspenseful and scientifically relevant as any of Richard Preston's novels (The Hot Zone, The Cobra Event), but it kind of settles for cheap thrills.<p>The movie just isn't very ambitious. There are some brilliant moments -- the opening sequence, with the lone survivor of the plague wandering forlorn through London -- and there are several suspenseful scenes. But it doesn't do much with the material, which is ripe for good cinematic treatment.<p>The direction is for the most part solid but sort of calls too much attention to itself, as if Danny Boyle were saying, &quot;Look at how cutting-edge I can be.&quot; I realize this is low-budget fare, but I'd rather have a cohesive story with characters that I care about than a lot of flash and a lot of mind-numbing quick-cuts.<p>&quot;28 Days Later&quot; (you gotta use the whole title, otherwise you're refering to the Sandra Bullock movie) reminded me strongly of &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; &quot;I Am Legend,&quot; and the thriller novels I mentioned above. The movie is derivative of those other works, but lacks much of their depth. All in all, I was entertained for a couple of hours, but also disappointed.</p></body></html>

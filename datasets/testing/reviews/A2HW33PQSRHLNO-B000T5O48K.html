<meta name="summary" content="Smoldering with intensity"></head><body><p>In hindsight, the viewer can tell that "Bug" is about much more than invading insects, rampant mental illness and broken lives, or government propaganda, though all three themes are crucial: it is a stern reminder of the power suggestion has over human vulnerability.<br /><br />Ashley Judd plays Agnes, a woman with an impoverished, lonely life resembling a train wreck. From the beginning of the film it's obvious that her loneliness is so intense that even a disaster would be welcome--any disaster save the one she already has to deal with, her vicious ex boyfriend Jerry played by Harry Connick Jr.  He does a very good job playing Southern scum, so much so that there are times you want to take his character by the throat.  Still, though, in the diseased house of cards that this movie comprises he may be one of the only people in Agnes' life who could have prevented the horrific, unforgettable ending.<br />Her gorgeous former lesbian lover R.C., played by Lynn Collins, departs way too quickly to make a difference.<br /><br />But to her credit, she is one who introduces Agnes to Peter, a really, really odd hitchhiker--maybe--who somehow ends up in her social circle.<br />Michael Shannon here gives the best performance as an extremely paranoid schizophrenic that I have ever seen.  At first calm, somewhat rational, mixing his self-tormenting delusions with the truth, there's not one scene with him in it that does not reek of potential danger.  His peculiar fondness for insect theory (which ends up extending to his supposed experiences in the Gulf War, which ends up extending to government experiments on veternans, which ends up extending to Agnes' smoke detector, the motel room itself, and then ultimately Agnes' lost child)  actually seem very believable when you watch the actor recite his lines.<br /><br />What takes place in the last 30 minutes of this movie is an unrelenting, Dionysian rush of psychological horror so intense that it is actually hard to watch--Peter does some dental work on himself in order to block the invasion of the "bugs" and it is one of the most brutal scenes I have ever witnessed on film (probably because it takes place so abruptly.)<br /><br />William Friedkin shows once again that he is a hungry talent to be reckoned with; his films always remind us that we can never quite know what goes on, not with absolute certitude, and that some of the most<br />momentous events leave us not with truth but with more questions.  This is a must see for anyone with a taste for great film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sad remake of a classic film"></head><body><p>This movie is an embarrassment and it's hard to believe that Steve Martin had a hand in writing it.<br /><br />The plot is the coach of the French national soccer team is murdered in front of a stadium full of fans and his ring, made of the Pink Panther diamond, is stolen from his finger. Police director Dreyfuss decides to assign the most inept inspector he has so he can solve the crime himself without the attention of the press on him. He gives the job to Clousseau, played by Steve Martin, and Clousseau bumbles his way through the investigation.<br /><br />The case at the center of the movie is uninteresting and nothing Clousseau does during his investigation lets the audience in on who might have done it. Clousseau suddenly figures it all out and explains it to everyone in the last five minutes of the movie. My real complaints are with the attempts at humor. Every pratfall and joke is telegraphed. They weren't funny to begin with, but when you know what's coming, it's pointless. For all his bumbling and stumbling, Peter Sellers still played Clousseau with subtlety. Martin plays him too broadly, turning him into a cartoon.<br /><br />I like Steve Martin and think he is very talented. There were some other very talented people in this movie like Kevin Kline and Jean Reno. Unfortunately they were part of a bad movie.</p></body></html>

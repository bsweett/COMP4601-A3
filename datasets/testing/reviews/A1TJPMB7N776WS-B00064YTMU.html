<meta name="summary" content="Gun for Hire"></head><body><p>"Collateral" is a beautiful film: vibrating with gorgeous digital-clear shots of Los Angeles from Pico-Union and Downtown to Hollywood and Koreatown. And like director Michael Mann's previous "Heat," "Collateral" is a visual tribute to Los Angeles. But "Collateral" is also a tribute to the acting talent of Tom Cruise who doesn't seem to get all the credit he is due: for example his excellent work in "Samurai" went virtually un-noticed last year.<br /><br />As Vincent, a cold blooded hit man, Cruise shows us once again that he can not only look good on screen, he can play a role completely against type and succeed admirably: his Vincent is cold, calculating, resolutely committed and totally focused on completing his task. Cruise's Vincent is a professional assassin: he kills for money because it is his job and is probably unsuited to much else; yet at the same time he revels in the hunt and the catch: enjoying it, feeling no remorse at all.<br /><br />Along the way he enlists/coerces/forces the help of a cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) who resists but ultimately adopts some of Vincent's amoral characteristics. Max becomes Vincent's unwitting disciple and his avenging angel.<br /><br />Michael Mann has directed with a keen eye and a jaundiced view of what makes Los Angeles, Los Angeles:  the City of the Angels, the final frontier of last chances, every inch the Wild Wild West where everything is cool as long as you wear the right clothes, have the right haircut and drive the hottest car.</p></body></html>

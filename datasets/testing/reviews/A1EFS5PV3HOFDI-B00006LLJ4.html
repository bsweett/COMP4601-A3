<meta name="summary" content="Running for your life never was this intense"></head><body><p>This is definatly one of Cruise' best and my favorite of Spielberg's after A.I. Minority Report is snappy, fun and intriguing as Cruise fights to break the rules and find the murderer of his son, and the man who he is supposed to kill.<br /><br />I say supposed, for Cruise is chief of Police, and Collaberater on a project called PreCrime.<br /><br />PreCrime in short is supposed to find and stop crimes before they've happened all due to the pheoninimal powers given to three people called the precogs. The Precogs dream of the crimes which is wired into a computer that allows Cruise to view and find the murders. Capture and imprison them.<br /><br />The only problem is that there is a minority report, being that some preplanned crimes where simply that. Preplanned but without going to really be enacted. Cruise finds this out when he himself is accused of a murder, sending this chief of police on a wild run to escape. Even more intense as Colin Farrell arrives as the FBI agent sent to take over the operations. And who goes after Cruise, even more deadset on capturing then the cops as he believes Precrime is bogus and wrong.<br /><br />So there's the basic formula to this movie, but what a movie it is. Think of it as Catch me if you can in a space age world, hectic and intrancing.<br /><br />Spielberg is a genus, and he weaves and tells this story like the best of them. So sit back and enjoy, and let the master take you away into his world.....</p></body></html>

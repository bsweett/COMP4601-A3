I am a big fan of John Cusack so I gave it a shot much to my chagrin. This is probably going to appeal to male teens and a few adults, but I don't see much market beyond this because it is basicly about 3 men and a teenager that travel back to the 1980s in a hot tub. They were so incredibly drunk at the time it takes them some time to realize what happened and how to track down the engineer, Chevy Chase, that can fix it. The biggest laugh is when a squirrel interrupts a touchdown play on TV that two of the men bet all their money and and one has to perform a sex act on the other. Does that sound like a movie you want to watch? Didn't think so unless you bullied teenagers in high school because I assure you the nerds don't reflect fondly on that time. I acutally was thirty-something in the "Eighties" and I loved living them. I still enjoy the music and most the movies made back then. This movie however didn't make me relive them in a good way. If you enjoyed this seek counciling.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lawrence Soars in a Haunting, Mirthless Regional Morality Tale"></head><body><p>Having made a strong impression two years ago as Charlize Theron's younger guilt-ridden self in Guillermo Arriaga's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S5N052">The Burning Plain</a>, Jennifer Lawrence brings such a primal, haunting stillness to her performance that she singlehandedly transcends the dispirited tone of director/co-writer Debra Granik's small-scale regional 2010 film. At first, the movie, co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, appears to concern itself with the spartan existence of a dirt-poor family in the Missouri Ozarks, but it turns into a far more personal story of one girl's intractable dedication to her family and how she faces life-threatening challenges in keeping her family home together. This is much more a tale of survival than spiritual uplift because 17-year-old Ree Dolly has to care for her two younger siblings while contending with a near-catatonic mother and a meth-making father who has apparently disappeared.<br /><br />Even though she harbors dreams of entering the military to secure the $40,000 promised in the recruiting ads, Ree has to deal with the harsh reality that her father has put up their house as collateral for his bail. If he doesn't show up for a trial in a week's time, dead or alive, they will lose everything. She is determined to find his whereabouts from his criminal relatives and associates despite the fact that she gets the same constant warning to mind her own business or face the consequences. In fact, her stubbornness is at such odds with tribal ties and local customs that she faces revelations she could not possibly be prepared to handle. While Ree remains undaunted in her search for the truth, she also discovers how she cannot break entirely free of her surroundings.<br /><br />Just as she did with an unknown Vera Farmiga as a coke-addicted mother in 2004's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0QL7I">Down to the Bone</a>, Granik extracts a sharply realistic, emotionally precise performance out of Lawrence. For example, when she listens to the soldier tell her to stay home to care for her family, she registers her character's resignation in a most economically searing manner. In smaller roles, John Hawkes etches a menacing presence as Teardrop, Ree's meth addict uncle who brutally warns her that her father may be dead, as does Dale Dickey as a plain-spoken woman who turns out to have more in common with Lady Macbeth. Michael McDonough's stark cinematography captures the bleakness of the rough, depressing terrain. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray includes a robust commentary track from Granik and McDonough, an informative 45-minute making-of feature, an alternate opening scene, and four deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

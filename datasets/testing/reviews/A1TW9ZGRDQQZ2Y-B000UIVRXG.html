<meta name="summary" content="Its No Shaun of the Dead"></head><body><p>While I really enjoyed Hot Fuzz, it falls well short of Shaun of the Dead. To me, the humor in Hot Fuzz wasn't as funny as the previous film, but the action sure made up for it. This movie also boasts ample gore and a couple of inventive death sequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are funny guys and I hope to see them team up many more times in the future.</p></body></html>

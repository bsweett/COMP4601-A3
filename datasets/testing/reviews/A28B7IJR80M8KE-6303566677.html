<meta name="summary" content="Arnold's signature movie!!"></head><body><p>When released in 1984, no one expected this to be a hit, but it definately set the tone for today's action movie, the film begins in the year 2027 A.D. where machines have taken over the world after a nuclear fallout, the human survivors have waged an all out non-stop war &amp; are very close to victory, so the machine's leader Skynet has the best plan of defeat, they will change the past by killing the mother of John Connor, the human resistance leader responsible for their near defeat, The Terminator, A machine disguised in human form is sent to the year 1984 to off Connor's mother Sarah, the resistence leader John then dispatches his own warrior Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the terminator (Scharzenegger), what follows is a cat &amp; mouse game with the Terminator killing anyone that gets in his way, Arnold has a field day as his famous villian, the best scene in the film is when he tracks her down, but his assasination attempt is ruined by Reese who has also tracked Sarah down, in a night club where Arnold &amp; Beihn face off, they escape but are pursued through the end, the future war is realistic in that is shows the consequences of letting computers run our lives, a very close reality, the sequel, although good, really contradicts this one, whereas you know by the end that the future can't be stopped, in T2 however it is , which would make the events of the 1st film non-existent, I don't hate T2, but feel it should have been done differently, this one however more than holds its own as a simple one-time movie, Terminator 3 is supposed to be on movie screens in 2003, hopefully we will see more of the future war, whereas in T2 we only see it in the beginning, which was disappointing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tale of heroism"></head><body><p>With the release of Oliver Stone's much anticipated "World Trade Center," the controversial director received just as much criticism as praise for his study of two of the heroes of 9/11. Those who share Stone's ardent leftist beliefs thought he should have made a film questioning the government's role in the events of that day. I'll be first in line when that movie gets made (don't count on it), but "World Trade Center" is excellent for what it is: a tale of heroism and determination in the face of overwhelming odds.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is superb as John McLaughlin, the port authority police sergeant who is buried, along with colleague Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), in the rubble of the Twin Towers while his family patiently awaits news of his condition.<br /><br />"World Trade Center" is a compelling survival story, vastly superior to "United 93," the other 9/11 film from 2006 which received praise all out of balance with its actual merits.<br /><br />Brian W.

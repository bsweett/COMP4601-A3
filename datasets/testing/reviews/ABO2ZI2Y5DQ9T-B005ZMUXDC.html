Once again the company's latest work "Tangled" proves that. This is a family picture everyone can enjoy, telling a good story about characters you relate to, with a healthy dose of action and comedy. But what is most impressive is the film's breathtakingly beautiful colors that saturate the animation's fairy tale world.<br /><br />Based on a tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, "Tangled" revolves around a 18-year-old girl Rapunzel living in a high tower among the woods. In fact, she was kidnapped as a baby from the king and the queen by Gothel, an elderly woman who knows the special power Princess Rapunzel possesses. Not knowing the world outside (and her true identity), Rapunzel dreams of traveling to see thousands of lights that float in the sky once a year.<br /><br />"Tangled" mixes the orthodox "boy-meets-girl" theme with fairy tale elements (though any sexual allusions of the original tale are carefully removed). The film keeps a steady pace with musical sequences, action scenes and nice comic turns from fearsome-looking (but actually likable) thugs drinking at a tavern, plus one non-speaking animal, Pascal the chameleon. Also, Maximus, a white horse of the royal guard, is a real scene stealer, who deserves his own movie.<br /><br />But what makes "Tangled" really special is its rich colors and lush textures. The amazing sky lantern scene is one of the many highlights of the film. This alone would be enough to give the film four stars or even more.</p></body></html>

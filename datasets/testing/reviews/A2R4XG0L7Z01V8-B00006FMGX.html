<meta name="summary" content="Great film, rubbish DVD"></head><body><p>Why is there no extras on this DVD? Not even a trailer, not something I would have expected from a Steven Spielberg film. Mind you, he's probably waiting until everyone's bought it, and then will release a special edition, director's cut, or some nonsense. I was very disappointed that there was no extras. I hate DVDs like that.<br /><br />I was a bit unsure about this movie, but I ended up really enjoying it. I wasn't keen on the very 1960s credits at the start, and the film seemed a bit overlong, but not in a tedious way. It's the only one of Leonardo DiCaprio's films I've liked since Titanic, and that's saying something. He does so well in this movie! He manages to look really young (thanks to a very dodgy haircut) and then looks older, and really gaunt at one point. It was all very well done, and it was a very subtle aging.<br /><br />It's a very intriguing film, finding out how people fake cheques, etc. How he managed to get away with it for as long as he did is shocking. And I LOVED the whole relationship between Tom Hanks & Leonardo, it was a very strange relationship, but at the same time, interesting. It's the way Tom Hanks starts off chasing him, and towards the end they end up being friends - and they're still friends to this day according to the end of the film.<br /><br />The end of the film bothered me a bit, it seemed awfully sluggish compared to the rest of it. Thankfully, both actors manage to almost rescue the film, and keep it going, and keep you watching. With different actors, it might have failed. And there's a whole host of supporting actors, including Christopher Walken (fabulous as ever), and a very strange role starring Jennifer Garner! It was quite a shock to see her, and it was a very small role, which didn't quite seem to fit in with the rest of the film. What happened to the cheque that he gave her? It only took her a day to film - what an easy life eh? She must have been paid a fair bit, just for a couple of minutes screen time.<br /><br />A highly recommended film, which will have you smiling right the way through, and will definitely get you in the mood to read the book. Maybe. Hopefully there will be a special edition at some point - despite the fact I'm a cynic at heart, I'm a sucker for these things.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Feel-Good Movie that is Smart Enough to Feel Bad Sometimes."></head><body><p>"Slumdog Millionaire" is a bilingual British-Indian production based on the novel "Q & A" by Loveleen Tandan, which I understand has been modified considerably be screenwriter Simon Beaufoy. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is an 18-year-old tea-server originally from the slums of Mumbai. In an attempt to reach the woman he loves (Freida Pinto), he becomes a contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?". He gets so close to the grand prize of 20 million rupees that he is suspected of cheating and arrested. He tries to convince a jaded police inspector (Irfan Khan) that he really did know the answer to the questions by recounting the episodes in his life from which he learned them.<br /><br />This is an optimistic romance that is coy about being either of those things most of the time. It generates a lot of energy but has a startling edge. The audience is hit full force with Jamal's violent life as a street child. Shifts back and forth in time, between Jamal's interrogation, his appearance on the show, and his recollections of years past can be jarring at first. But the frenetic energy of it all matches that of the slums and of life on the run for Jamal and his brother Salim. Irfan Khan can play any role, and he is terrific here as a detective whose patience is wearing thin but whose curiosity gets the better of him, even though he's not such a nice guy.<br /><br />There have been a lot of sleazy characters in Jamal's life, and the film is populated with them. Jamal is the proverbial nice guy from the wrong side of the tracks who has been hindered by circumstances and unscrupulous people. Yet he is savvy and single-minded. His brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) is almost Jamal's alter-ego, a bully who chose a life of crime to get ahead. But he is equally savvy and single-minded, with a different value system. The love-hate relationship between the two men brings a lot of substance to the story. "Slumdog Millionaire"'s amalgamation of gritty reality, upbeat rhythms, and clich&eacute;d optimism make it a unique, enjoyable experience. In English and Hindi with subtitles that are part of the film, not superimposed.</p></body></html>

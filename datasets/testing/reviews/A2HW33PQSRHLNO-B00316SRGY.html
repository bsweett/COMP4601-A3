The way he coordinates the demands of his increasing age with the remarkably bitter and yet deeply decent character, Walt Kowalski, reflects a man rigorously dedicated not only to his art but to making sense of the ruthless, ultra macho image that has been created around him since "Dirty Harry".<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is an embittered Korean veteran who lives in a bad area of Detroit with the Humungs, a group of Koreans who fought with the United States in Vietnam and relocated to various economically impoverished areas.  Walt liberally uses the terms gook, spook, dragon people, and an assorted list of racial epithets that fire off so easily one can't help be amused by them.  He's a man of a different generation and is not a "value racist": this is how he has emerged from warfare and 1950's Americana.<br /><br />Walt is in some ways like a ghost.  The values he cherishes--extreme masculinity, tribal patriotism, family, and even the proper way to approach the tabernacle in the Catholic Church--seem to be disappearing before his eyes.  His faith is also questionable at the beginning of the film. After his wife's funeral, he tells a young priest that he has no desire whatsoever to confess to an "overeducated 27 year virgin who holds the hands of old women and promises them eternal life."<br /><br />His Korean neighbors reciprocate his feelings of animosity.  There are parts of this fim that are drop dead funny because political correctness is dropped entirely.  Walt is not unlike the racist grandparents some of us have had, and if we have, we immediately feel a mix of repugnance and adoration for his absolute certitude in all situations.  Including putting an M-1 to the head of a gangster who steps on his lawn.<br /><br />Thao, a young Korean who lives near Walt, is pressured by his cousin to join the local gang.  After mistakenly trying to fit in with the gang and steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, which he built himself,<br />they see him as a punk but still insist he try another criminal act to be initiated into the gang.<br /><br />The rest of the film is a meditation on mortality, self sacrifice, and what it means to love another group of people regardless of race, ethnicity, or anything.  The ending, though sad, is also beautiful.<br /><br />One of the top ten films of 2008.</p></body></html>

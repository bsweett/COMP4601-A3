<meta name="summary" content="Even my wife liked it."></head><body><p>A friend of mine who grew up in China strongly recommended this movie to me. He knew my fondness for martial arts movies, especially kung fu movies. He said they got a lot of things right. The villian even had a decidedly Japanese name. I was busy at the time, but stored the name away for a potential rental on a subzero day in the upcoming winter. I watched it last night. The movie was very good.<br /><br />Jack Black as the Panda was excellant. Hoffman as the master was very good. The animation was good enough. The starting dream sequence imitated the "Samurai Jack" style of animation and was hilarious. The humor drove the movie. I'm not a philosopher, but the lessons of the movie were basically the westernized, simplified Zen teachings you get now days. It is basically the same lesson as the "The Last Dragon," but this movie is far better. The fight scenes using animals were creative. The villian was evil and scary.<br /><br />What made me appreciate the movie is that it made my wife laugh. She never understood my predilection for martial art movies and approached this movie with a little trepidation, but she was laughing throughout. In other words, this is a very funny movie.</p></body></html>

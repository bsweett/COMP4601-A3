<meta name="summary" content=""Heat" is One of the Best Films Ever!"></head><body><p>When I first saw this film I was around 16 and wasn't that impressed mainly because I thought it was kind of boring. Now that I have matured I thought I would give it another try and I dusted off my DVD from my shelf and watched it for a second time tonight (four years later). I was blown away by the acting, screenplay, action, music, emotion, and the fact I felt bad for the "bad" guys. This film has it all and after this viewing it has moved up the ranks to my top 25 list of all time. Pacino and De Niro are magnificint to say the least. I can't believe this film didn't get a single Oscar. It should have been up at the very least for Best Picture and Director. This is one great film that took me too long to realize what I had been missing.</p></body></html>

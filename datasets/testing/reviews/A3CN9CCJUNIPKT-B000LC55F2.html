<meta name="summary" content="An entirely diverting film... enjoyable, with a slight twist"></head><body><p>I thought this was an entertaining, engrossing film, with enough of a plot twist to keep us engaged, and a freshing formalism to the script -- particularly in its use of plot symmetries and (metaphorical) mirror-image contrasts.  The acting was quite nice -- although the younger actors are all a tad callow, Michael Caine and David Bowie were both delightful onscreen, each stealing the show in his own way.  This is hardly a masterpiece or an immortal work of cinema, but it's several notches above the current state of action-suspense dramas, mid-decade in the '00s.  Definitely worth checking out.</p></body></html>

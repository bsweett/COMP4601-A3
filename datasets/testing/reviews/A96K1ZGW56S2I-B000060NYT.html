The banter between the brother and sister was great, and rather realistic and other than the profanity reminded me of conversations I have had on long drives. The way one sees the Winnebago turn a corner in the backseat window and the BEATNU truck suddenly come up behind the sibling pair is a classic piece of cinematography. The way the film continues to build up with some more DUEL-type suspense is great.  However, once the brother and sister check out the pipe behind the old church, the film starts to fall apart.<p>The movie slows down a lot after that and I found myself fastforward viewing through the slowest moments. A lot of elements are introduced to the story that have little bearing on the plot. And the song, what in the world does the song Jeepers Creepers have to do with the movie? Nothing as far as I could tell.<p>The Creeper itself may not have been that impressive of a monster. However, I found it nice for once to have a horror movie where the horror was a real monster. Unfortunately, this monster is indestructible. That makes the film rather disappointing. What's the point in fighting a battle (or watching a movie) where nothing, absolutely nothing, can be gained? I mean, come on, even Superman has kryptonite and demons can be exorcised; every creature has to have some weakness. But apparently, the Creeper doesn't. That's a shame because it would have made the showdown in the police station all that more interesting.</p></body></html>

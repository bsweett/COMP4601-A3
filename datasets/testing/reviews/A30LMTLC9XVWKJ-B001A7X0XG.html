Basically a weird mix of "Polar Express" and "Kill Bill 1"; with a plot that seems to have randomly selected script elements from every "Matrix"-like film produced over the past ten years. When "Polar Express was first released, many predicted that the substitution of animation for live action would take over the film industry. But they expected this to be driven from the animation side and not from the live action side. But "Ultraviolet" shows that this takeover is really being driven by the live action production companies. It is a cartoon with occasional cutaways to actors, interactions between actors and animation, and a voice-over narration.<br /><br />Interestingly, not only is this not a new thing, it actually goes back to the days of silent films. In the early 1920's Max and Dave Fleischer introduced a cartoon series called "Out of the Inkwell" which superimposed animated figures on real film backgrounds (allowing a live actor to interact with a cartoon character). Walt Disney (in his pre-Mickey Mouse days ) borrowed the idea for his series of "Alice" cartoons (there were 56 cartoons in the series) and even reversed the idea and superimposed a live actress (Virginia Davis) on an animated background. Obviously these early examples are crude by the standards of "Ultraviolet's" digital effects but the concept itself is identical.<br /><br />"Ultraviolent" is not much of a story but it is decorated with many stunningly beautiful shots of Milla Jovovich as the title character. The story is weaker than the "Underworld" series but on a par with most of vampire-Matrix-post apocalyptic-CGI stuff the industry has been cranking out lately; including Milla's "Resident Evil" movies. The negative criticism of "Ultraviolent" relative to this other garbage is absurd; its all pretty awful but at least here there is an emphasis on the Milla visuals and her costumes are second only to Beckinsale's. They would be just as good if the costumer had realized that flat black presents major contrast problems.<br /><br />Milla can act (see "Dummy") but not much is required in that department for "Ultraviolet".<br /><br />"Ultraviolet" is based on a comic book and the film features loads of lame hyper-edited martial arts scenes that don't require stunt work because they are just microsecond cuts edited together to simulate fighting.<br /><br />"Ultraviolet's" plot revolves around a young boy that Milla is trying to protect. They are caught between a government run by the medical establishment and a resistance movement of disease-enhanced humans. That might sound like "Dark Angel" but instead of a "Bladerunner" production design, think of 1980's "Flash Gordon".<br /><br />All in all, "Ultraviolent" is as good as most of these futuristic exercises in excess and better than some.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></body></html>

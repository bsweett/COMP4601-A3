Well, perhaps they have retired into normal lives with normal families.  Perhaps.<br /><br />Not long after Mr. Incredible marries Elastigirl, a mountain of lawsuits pile up against all the super heroes from the destruction they leave behind while saving the world and the people who inhabit it.  Forced into retirement, the Incredibles settle down to lead a normal life, working normal jobs and raising their children.<br /><br />Well, while their jobs may be normal, their children are not.  Violet has invisibility and force field capability, and Dash had super speed powers.  Only baby Jack-Jack appears to be without superpowers.<br /><br />Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) is extremely unhappy with his boring bank job, and often gets together with his best friend, Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone) to secretly fight crime.  When the beautiful Mirage spies on them and discovers their identity, she sends a proposal to Mr. Incredible that is too good for him to refuse.<br /><br />Bob hides his new "career" from his wife Helen (a.k.a. Elastigirl), though Helen notices Bob's happy new attitude and obvious weight loss.  Until the day she discovers Mr. Incredible's newly mended suit and her suspicions lead her to chase him down to a small volcanic island.<br /><br />It is here that things begin to go awry for the Incredibles, and when Helen discovers that Dash and Violet have stowed away on her plane as she flies off to confront her husband, the hilarious events become a family affair.<br /><br />The Incredibles is not just a kid's movie, it's great for the entire family.  I thought at first it would be too tame and too lame to watch, but I was delightfully surprised to discover how captivating and well done the movie is.  Don't be afraid to pick it up and watch it, the humor is sharp and witty and the plot is clever and absorbing.  Trust me, my kids are all grown and I bought this movie strictly for myself.<br /><br />Look for great performances from voice actors Samuel Jackson, Elizabeth Pena, Wallace Shawn, Craig T. Nelson, and Holly Hunter.  Highly entertaining with a hilarious ending, The Incredibles is a movie everyone can love.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Memento"></head><body><p>If a movie can be deemed a "Thriller" or a "Mystery" this would be it,people who have seen Nolan's work(with the exception of Dark Knight)The Prestige being a prime example and a movie I enjoyed more than this.I am not sure if it is Guy Pearce(not his performance) or the back and fourth of the plot,Joe Pantoliano puts in a good performance,it is a sad movie to me really and a bizarre one.I was pleasantly surprised by a cameo by Thomas Lennon(Lt.Dangle of Reno 911!),I think the idea of the movie and the story is right,but the overall execution of the film and especially the ending is what keeps me from even bothering to wrap my noodle around it once more or even bother to question it,I am not a lazy movie guy or a simpleton but I think sometimes people want to make something seem "Intelligent" when overall it is a regurgitated story going over and over again,That's not to say my experience or feelings about it takes anything from the work on the contrary many would be intrigued and might even like it,I neither like it nor hate it, I am indifferent towards the movie.</p></body></html>

Upon this recommendation, I watched the movie and was not disappointed.<br /><br />EQUILIBRIUM is a movie that takes place in the not-so-distant future. After years of war that have wracked and scarred the planet, a new government has taken control and from all appearances things seem at peace.  The new government keeps order because all forms of Art: paintings, music, literature, etc; have been outlawed and made illegal. To ensure that no Art is produced, a group of specially trained officers known as Grammaton Clerics are trained to find hidden Art, destroy it, and kill those who produce it.  Needless to say, an underground rebellion rises up to fight against the oppression.  The resistance finds their hero in the most famous of the Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale).  Preston was forced to kill his partner, Partridge, when Partridge refused to turn in a book of poetry that had been confiscated.  Through reading those poems, Preston, like a futuristic Apostle Paul, begins to realize the oppression that he has had a help in creating and seeks to set things right.<br /><br />EQUILIBRIUM borrows many elements from the best of sci-fi. The dystopian society reminds one of George Orwell's 1984 or Ray Bradbury's FARENHEIT 451. Preston is in many ways a conglomeration of the firemen in FARENHEIT 451 and Harrison Bergeron from Kurt Vonnegut's famous story. The "Gun Kata" martial art that is introduced in the film reminds one of fighting scenes in THE MATRIX.  However, despite all the similarities, EQUILIBRIUM does an excellent job of incorporating this various sci-fi themes and molding them together into something that is original.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the film went unnoticed in theatres.  The movie has some great acting, good special effects, and great plot and character development. It's a sci-fi movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

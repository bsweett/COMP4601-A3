As they travel, sometimes alone and sometimes together, across a surreal landscape made anarchic by war, director Sergio Leone presents a world in which all of man's finer instincts and civilized institutions seem to have failed.  Our three protagonists keep faith in one thing only--the existence of treasure at the end of their quest--and they go to heroic lengths in service of that faith.  Leone's despairing vision is fascinating, and as an action movie, it is just downright terrific.</p></body></html>

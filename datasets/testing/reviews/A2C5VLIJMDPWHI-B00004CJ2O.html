<meta name="summary" content="Childhood Memories"></head><body><p>It amazes me what scares some people and doesn't move others. I never found this movie to be scary, but I had the BEST Halloweens because of this movie. My brother would dress up as Jason and stomp down the street chasing all the kids on my block.  I'd be the lead one screaming and running, somehow more scared of my own brother than I was of this movie.  We even had a stuffed Jason who sat on our doorstep so when kids came to collect candy, one of us would whisper, in a deep voice, out of a side window just to watch trick or treaters fly down the stairs.  I tried watching this movie about two weeks ago on a pay per view station and it's still not too much to be scared of, but I have to thank this movie for some pretty entertaining childhood memories, especially during my five years as a girl scout.  The camping trips could not have been any better than me reminding my peers about Jason coming out to get us while we slept in our tents.  I think it's cool for easily scary people and probably even more entertaining for men because there were more women being unnecessarily undressed in this flick than I can think of for any other.</p></body></html>

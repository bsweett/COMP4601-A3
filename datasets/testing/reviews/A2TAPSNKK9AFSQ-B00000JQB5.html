<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Rocks!!! (And Ms. Weisz Is Pretty Hot Too!!!)"></head><body><p>This would have to be one of my favourite Horror  movies. It stars Brendan Fraser in a role reminiscent of Harrison Ford in the Indian Jones Movies but this movie is set in Egypt where an Ancient Mummy has returned to life and must be distroyed. Brendan is joined in his hunt by the beautiful Rachel Weisz with a very sexy English accent. I only wish the my local Librarian looked as good as her. A thrilling chase, a few unexpecte twists and the good guys put up one hell of a fight? Movie entertainment at it's best!!!</p></body></html>

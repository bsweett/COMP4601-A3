<meta name="summary" content="Yes, Virginia, there IS a plot resolution..."></head><body><p>Everybody who is looking at this product page already knows the basic plot of "No Country for Old Men," so I will not waste time recounting it here. So many of the reviews take the Coen Brothers to task for not resolving the plot at the end. I beg to differ; there IS a resolution to the plot of "No Country for Old Men." The resolution is simply so bleak and dour--cutting us off totally from the traditional pleasures of crime dramas, Westerns and even film noir--that viewers just don't want to believe it. I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's original novel, but everything I've read about the film leads me to believe it is extremely faithful to the source. McCarthy, for those unfamiliar with his work, is a novelist whose views of life and fate make Thomas Hardy look like A.A. Milne. It isn't surprising, then, that the makers of "Blood Simple" and "The Man Who Wasn't There" would find McCarthy's work so congenial, and be able to do justice to his unsparing vision while other filmmakers (Billy Bob Thornton's version of "All the Pretty Horses" comes to mind) flinch from it. "No Country for Old Men" is the Coen Brothers' best film since "Fargo" (though even "Fargo" is a Disneyfied cheerfest compared with "No Country for Old Men"; if Cormac McCarthy had written "Fargo," Marge Gunderson and her unborn child would have been residual casualties, and Gunsrud would still be wandering the prairies looking for a "pancakes house"). "No Country for Old Men" is a movie I greatly admire and respect, though--unlike "Fargo"--it's not a movie I envision watching over and over again. But the Coen Brothers certainly blast the film's memory into your brain, as surely as Anton Chigurh's cattle gun. The film's screenplay (by the Coens, of course) and cinematography (vast echoing expanses of desert and mountain, captured brilliantly by the great Roger Deakins) are perfect in every way. So are the lead performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, each earning a one-way ticket to Brandoville, the capital of Olivier Land. The supporting performances of Woody Harrelson, Kelly Jean Macdonald, Barry Corbin, Tess Harper, Beth Grant, Gene Jones, Stephen Root and others are of equal (that is to say, surpassing) excellence. "No Country for Old Men" is unquestionably a great movie. I must confess, however, that after seeing it I had to watch "I Remember Mama" as an antidote.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Promises"></head><body><p>Viggo Mortensen is at the center of David Cronenberg's "Eastern Promises" and as such all the characters and the plot points surround him as a Cobra surrounds it's prey. Far from a victim though Mortensen's Nikolai, a low level Chauffeur for the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;'s closeted homosexual son of clan leader, Armin Mueller-Stahl, played by whacked-out Vincent Chassell, Nikolai is all seeing, all doing: he is an enforcer capable of doing the worse kind of jobs in this world without flinching and in several scenes Cronenberg stretches the bounds of good taste but somehow always manages not to snap them.<br />Naomi Watts is also on hand here as a Russian/English mid-wife, Anna and she brings empathy and humanity to this world of depravity, lust and violence. She also sees a kindred spirit in Nikolai though on the surface he is anything but.<br />Mortensen's Nikolai is a superbly complicated character: cynical, intelligent, world-weary and tough enough to stub out a cigarette on his tongue.<br />The centerpiece of "Eastern Promises" is Nikolai's attack in a steam bath by Chechen/Armani clad hit men bent on killing him. Nikolai is nude, his assailants are not. The scene goes on for a number of minutes and it is both violent and beautiful with Cronenberg's camera flying above capturing all the grandeur of his mise en scene.<br />The world of "Eastern Promises" is much more complicated than that of "A History of Violence" wherein small town values were contrasted with big city perversities. In "Eastern Promises," Cronenberg is after bigger fish: the natural order of things is questioned, the underworld is brought squealing and squirming into the light.<br />Cronenberg has a lot on his plate here dealing with not only the disenfranchised natural born English but also those forced into slavery by the Russian mob and brought to England to satisfy the mercurial as well as the sexual needs of a western nation. Angels vs. Devils, Good vs. Evil: it's all here in this elegiac, gorgeously photographed film, Cronenberg's most cogent, most visceral, most rhapsodic.</p></body></html>

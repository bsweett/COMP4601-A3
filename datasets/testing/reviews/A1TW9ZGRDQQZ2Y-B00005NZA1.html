<meta name="summary" content="I Liked it Much More the 2nd Time Around!"></head><body><p>The first time I saw this movie I would have given it three stars. Now that I have seen it numerous times, I would consider it my favorite M. Night film (followed by The Sixth Sense, The Village, and finally Signs) even though I liked all four of his films a great deal. It's a little slow at times, but it is a  great superhero film with a little more realism than say Spiderman. Worth buying, especially if you like M. Night's films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Just Another Chick Flick"></head><body><p>A middle aged woman (Joan Allen) with four daughters thinks her husband has run off with his Swedish secretary. She's a little angry. She's angry at him, the secretary, her daughters, the neighbour and just about anyone who breaths in her direction.<br /><br />In walks radio commenter Denny (Kevin Costner). He's a retired, alcoholic, baseball player with his own demons and quirks, like having a supply of baseballs in storage for when he's in the mood to autograph. Usually when he's drunk<br /><br />Together they spend a lot of time drinking. He enjoys the noise of her family and the smell of her kitchen; so much so he lets her walk all over him. Joan's voice is quite threatening but he takes everything she says with a grain of salt and lets her have her space.<br /><br />This movie is surprising funny with a few touching moments. Joan Allen plays a vicious character. Her and Kevin have an enjoyable and believable chemistry. There was a fantasy scene where Joan thinks about someone's head exploding that seemed more like a regression into an Alley McBeal episode but overall it's an enjoyable film with more than one surprise in its storyline. It's not just another chick flick. Review written by M. E. Wood.</p></body></html>

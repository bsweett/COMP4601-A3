<meta name="summary" content="Downfall"></head><body><p>Intense and intimate portrayal of Hitler's demise has the crazy, nightmarish feel of a Bosch painting, with a pervading sense of unreality, the last barrier to death and destruction. This is an astounding film experience for those with the stomach for it. Ganz renders Hitler so expertly that the effect is spooky, as if the dead had been brought back to life. Other searing performances come from Juliane Kohler as a curiously cheery, detached Eva Braun, and both Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch make your blood run cold playing the twisted, ever loyal Josef and Magda Goebbels. Finally, the delicate, wide-eyed Lara beguiles as Traudl, a mostly innocent lamb placed by fate right in the center of the wolf's lair. Nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, with good reason.</p></body></html>

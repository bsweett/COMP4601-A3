Yimou Zhang's direction is exceptional, with breathless landscapes, intense perspectives and seamless action scenes that manage to shine coherently despite the frequent jump cuts. The film's rich sequence of colors gives each act a distinct, easily identifiable tone and flavor, which is naturally the most pronounced aspect most admirers will remember. What took me by surprise with this viewing, though, was how integral the audio was. Every action in each fantastic fight scene is matched by a subtle, but perfect, sound effect that hammers home the precision and power of each stomp, leap or swing. An ambitious visual feat that delivers in spades, it also carries a poignant, timeless message about the necessity and ultimate intentions of war.</p></body></html>

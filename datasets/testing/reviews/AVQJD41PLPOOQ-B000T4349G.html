<meta name="summary" content="Easily FORGOTTEN!"></head><body><p>The first half of this film takes you into a psychological mystery that succeeds in keeping you wondering.<br /><br />However, by the time the mystery is finally revealed, you're ultimately let down by what feels like a cliche of the "aliens stole my brain!" revelation (hey, it practically happened to Arnold in TOTAL RECALL).  Unfortunately, even Julianne Moore's good acting can't save this one.<br /><br />Perhaps if this ridiculous story had been used for an X-FILES movie of the week, it would have made more sense.</p></body></html>

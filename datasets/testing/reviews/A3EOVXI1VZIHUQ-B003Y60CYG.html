<meta name="summary" content="A slower paced movie for a slower paced generation"></head><body><p>Like the radio show, the movie isn't for young audiences, and not because it's crude or anything like that, it's simply a mature movie for a mature audience; an audience that is willing to sit still for two hours and watch a story slowly unfold, a story that isn't really going anywhere surprising.<br /><br />A Prairie Home Companion really is a good movie. Garrison Keillor's acting skills are comparable with his superb radio voice, as he makes his big screen debut in this adaptation of his weekly show. All the other performers, as expected, are equally enjoyable. Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and John C. Reilly really stand out. Lindsay Lohan stands out in the opposite way; as in, "what is she doing here?" She really doesn't add much to the movie and her character is kind of annoying. Similarly, Virginia Madsen's character could have been done without, but that's what makes A Prairie Home Companion a good movie and not a great one.<br /><br />Robert Altman moves the story along slowly and we really get to know all the varying characters and their eccentric personalities. The entire film has a very heartwarming feel to it, and you can tell that the entire cast, and the director really care about being there on set and making something enjoyable. Whether that something appeals to a wide market is really unimportant compared to making the film you want.<br /><br />If you like the radio show, check the movie out. If you've never heard of the radio show, you may be left wondering what's going on and why you should care. Either way, you can't really bash this movie because it's got so much to love: songs, performances, and a highly acclaimed cast. So, if you don't like it now, wait a few years, and watch it on a rainy day. See how you feel about it then.</p></body></html>

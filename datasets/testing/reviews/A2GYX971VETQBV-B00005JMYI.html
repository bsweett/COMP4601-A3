Whenever you're watching a comedy whose talent is a bit low on the sophisticated meter, you have to be enthralled by the characters and the actors who play them.  Ferrell delivers in spades and, while the plot spins around and goes nowhere, he manages to continually delight the audience with his own brand of humor.  Bottom line, if you love Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, you will love _Anchorman_.  If you don't, shop elsewhere.<br /><br />The premise of the film is a hilarious look at the power of reporters during the "golden age" of local television.  The character of Ron Burgandy is absolutely hilarious and it is a delight to see a chauvinistic icon struggle with what he views as an invasion by women in the workforce.  My only complaint with the film is the same complaint that I have with many of the comedies that are being released these days.  These comedies seem to be based off quick sketch ideas, many of which are spawned from Saturday Night Live and the like.  The problem with this formula is that many of these sketches are hard to sustain over a couple of minutes, let alone a feature length film.  One gets the impression that these films, including _Anchorman_, would be truly dynamite if they could just restrict themselves to an hour.  The "90 minute" comedy rule is just too long for these films to sustain their interest, forcing them to sag at many points.<br /><br />That being said, _Anchorman_ still receives my approval.  Each time I have seen it, I have been laughing out loud and forced to tears at a few spots.  Will Ferrell's performance is stunning and I think he is truly one of the most gifted comedic actors working these days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good dead movie"></head><body><p>George romero did a great job with this higher budget zombie flick.<br />On blu ray it even looks better, some of his fans didn't enjoy this one but it is filled with social satire and good old fashioned gore. It is much better than 'day of the dead" in which it's very small budget kept most of the action inside of a bunker, but not as great as the truly classic by any horror fans standards: 'dawn of the dead"  or the first and great 'night of the living dead"  , still this movie has a fine pacing and good performances from the top notch cast.  It's worth getting on blu ray as part of any superior horror dvd collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?"></head><body><p>The age old question of what happens when we die is explored in director Clint Eastwood's elegant but slow HEREAFTER.<br />Three separate stories inevitably converge to a union of its three chief protagonists which seemed a little contrived to me, but effective nonetheless.<br />An Oscar-nominated tsunami opens the film nicely and segues into the more conventional storyline.  Eastwood's direction is understated and unobtrusive, allowing the strong performances to drive the film.  Matt Damon is excellent and generous, not succumbing to his star power nor trying to dominate the movie.  Cecile de France brings a haunting strength and eloquence to her role and the McLaren twins are heartbreakingly convincing.<br />I wasn't totally impressed because it seemed dull at times and almost too restrained as if Clint was trying to overly arthouse his direction.  I also didn't care for Bryce Howards or Jay Mohr's performances.<br />Overall, the movie offers poignant reactions to death and life without offering definitive answers.  The talent is obvious--it just didn't overwhelm me.</p></body></html>

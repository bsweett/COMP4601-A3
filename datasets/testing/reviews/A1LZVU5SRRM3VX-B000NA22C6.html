<meta name="summary" content="Solid, well-acted adaptation"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor.  Whether over-the-top funny in Pirates of the Caribbean and Ed Wood, or more understated like in this film or Edward Scissorhands, Depp adds a balanced believability to the characters he portrays that makes them leap from the screen in full 3-D.  The supporting cast is solid but unspectacular, so it is Depp who really shines here.<br /><br />The film stays very close to the short story in most respects.  After watching the film, I re-read the story (in Stephen King's Four Past Midnight collection) and found large sections of dialogue translated directly into the screenplay.  There are some subtle plot variances between the screenplay and the story, but the influence of King's storyline is very evident in the screenplay.  Ironically, the part that deviates the most from King's story is the ending--("I want you to fix the ending, Mr. Rainey.")  All things considered, however, this is a very faithful adaptation of a lesser known King work that does not lose the macabre devilishness of King's writing in translation to the screen.<br /><br />The only thing with which I found fault was the initial pacing of the film.  Part of the slow pace is intentional--setting up Mort's slothful state of existence is key to the story--but after 20 minutes or so, it begins to wear a bit thin and the viewer may wind up wondering whether this is really going to go anywhere.  It eventually does go somewhere, but it takes a bit of patience for the plot elements to gel and garner any serious viewer interest.  Stick around for the ride, however, and you'll be glad that you peered through this secret window and spied Depp's performance.</p></body></html>

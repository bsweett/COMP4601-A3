<meta name="summary" content="Superb story, poor camera work, some terrible hamming"></head><body><p>I would rate the plot five stars: it is clever, it is logical, and it has its twists and turns. The script is also excellent, with sharp dialogue and some wit.<br /><br />On the negative side: First there is the terrible camera work, with the camera unsteady most of the time, and violently shaking during the scene when the police enter the bank.<br /><br />Secondly, there is the hamming of the actress representing Ms White. Her gratuitous cockiness and nastiness and threats make me sick whenever she appears.<br />The same is true, though to a lessor extent, of the gloating of Detective Frazier. (Incidentally, what did he do with the diamond? Did he pocket it?)</p></body></html>

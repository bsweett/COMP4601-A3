It can be easy to see that when watching the ultra glossy, over the top action that is found throughout Hostage, which finds Bruce Willis as a burned out hostage negotiator whose family has been taken hostage, and whose lives depend on that of another family taken hostage as well by a trio of young, would be thieves (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, and Marshall Allman).  However, things don't go as well as one would hope, and soon enough good 'ol Bruce has to take matters into his own hands.  Willis is pretty good in a role that fits him like a glove, while the glossy action sequences end up being surprisingly tense and bloody to boot.  However, Hostage ends up being way more over the top than it should be thanks to the schizoid screenplay, and the performances from Tucker, Marshall, and Foster in particular who apparently would have been better off in the looney bin.  All in all, Hostage is worth a look for Willis fans or mainstream action junkies, but you can do far, far better.</p></body></html>

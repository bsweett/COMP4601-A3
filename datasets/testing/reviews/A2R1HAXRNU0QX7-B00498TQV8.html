<meta name="summary" content="2.5 stars.  Jennifer Lawrence gives a nice performance but the movie bored me."></head><body><p>A few years ago, I read Daniel Woodrell's WINTER'S BONE and found much to admire.  Set in the most destitute portions of our nation, the Ozark country of southern Missouri...it told the story of young Ree Dolly, a 17-year-old girl and her desperate efforts to find her missing father and bring him to court before his bail is revoked.  Because the bail her dad put up was the deed to the Dolly house and land.  This would have left Ree and her two young siblings and her mentally ill mother homeless.<br /><br />The book showed in great detail a land wracked by poverty and ruined by crystal meth.  An insular society where the only code is not revealing anything to the outside world, especially law enforcement.  But a society where women, especially teen girls, are not allowed to snoop and pry into the doings of the men.  A society in which being beaten or killed for asking the wrong question is tolerated.  A world of grinding poverty, poor health care and terrible education.  And in the midst of all this, was the heroic Ree...smarter than everyone around her, but also forced to accept a role beyond her years.<br /><br />The book was atmospheric and well-written.  But it was slowly paced and ultimately a bit boring.<br /><br />Now the film version has come along, and it captures the book nearly perfectly.  Both the successes and the failures.  The film does an outstanding job of capturing the landscape and the desolation.  There are many movies that show bleak landscapes and somehow make them beautiful.  WINTER'S BONE shows an area that is deeply unattractive and does not try to show any hidden beauty or stark nobility.  It's cold and it's covered with trash.  You look at the land, and realize that no one COULD ever prosper there...the poverty we see has bled into the land.  This is very effectively captured throughout the movie.<br /><br />Ree Dolly, who is in every scene of the film, is played by Jennifer Lawrence.  She looks a little like a young, cherubic Renee Zellweger.  It's her first major role, and she is thoroughly committed and accomplished.  Her accent is perfect, and she captures the great intelligence of her character.  It's an intelligence that has been muted by circumstance.  And she's also very brave, because she knows she has no choice but to succeed in her quest, even at the risk of her own safety.  Most other roles are fairly small, but all are played well.  I particularly liked John Hawkes, who played Ree's Uncle Teardrop.  A mildly dangerous man who feels compelled to help out his kin.<br /><br />So there was much to admire in the film.  It certainly treated the book faithfully.  And thus, the movie was slowly paced and boring.  It was frankly hard to care much about most of the characters.  Even Ree is mostly compelling intellectually, not emotionally.  Everyone tends to move very slowly, and there are just a lot of scenes of Ree walking from place to place.  Again, we get a GREAT sense of the place...but if I just wanted to look at landscapes, I'd watch a Terrence Malick film.  I want some compelling story, purpose or character to draw me along...and to a large extent, that is just missing.  And as with the book, the ending is anti-climactic.  It fits the whole morose, slow-paced tone of the story...but it also results in a film that never raises our pulse.  Honestly, I simply struggled to remain awake to the end, even though the movie is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence may get a well-deserved boost to her career with WINTER'S BONE.  And often, a good performance is enough for me to recommend seeing a film...I think good acting needs to be seen and appreciated.  However, the film has too many other problems, and I'd recommend passing by this dark, dreary journey.</p></body></html>

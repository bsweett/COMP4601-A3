<meta name="summary" content="A holiday classic"></head><body><p>I'd never really thought a Will Farrell would become a holiday classic, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE">Elf</a> is a wonderful Christmas treat. The story is simple enough: a human is adopted by Santa's elves, but then returns to New York to find his birth father. As expected, what ensues is one major culture clash. It's absolutely hilarious, with Farrell walking around New York City in an elf costume and getting into all sorts of trouble. My family watches it every Christmas Eve. It certainly beats the usual sappy holiday specials.</p></body></html>

She's fearful of developing the same condition.  When her father dies, they discover mathematical proofs that could rock the world as we know it.  The question is--did her father write the proofs or did she?  This is a fascinating and intelligent drama.  I found it difficult to follow due to so much of the story being told in flashbacks.  In many ways, due to Hopkins's excellent acting, the flashbacks were far more real than the storyline they were trying to portray in current time.  Hopkins was almost too good of choice for the father--he far overshadowed either of the lead's performances.</p></body></html>

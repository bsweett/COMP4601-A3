A futuristic tale is in the strong shadow of Bradbury's Fahrenheit 411, so strong, that you wonder why they just did not call it an outright remake.  Equilibrium is set in the post World War III era, where they evidently watched Star Trek one time too many and bought into Doctor Spock's lack of emotion is superior to human emotions.  To see this robot-state exists, where all emotions are suppressed, the government ruthlessly removes anything to provoke feelings.  In Bradbury's tales it was books - Fahrenheit 411 being the temperature at which paper burns.  In this movie, it's anything that provokes passion, senses.  Books, Grand Masters' paintings...even puppies.<br /><br />It's beautifully lensed, and writer-director Kurt Wimmer gives you a pinch of this and a dram of that, blending a Metropolis and Fahrenheit 411 feel to paint this bleak picture of the possible future.  Christian Bale (Reign of Fire) turns in a strong performance as the dispassionless top cop, who busts the "sense offenders" It's no surprise when the work eventually gets to him, and a gentle fuzzy puppy breaks through his already cracking resolve, setting him off in a near one man crusade to make change.  His performance is a tour de force, raising the movie to a<br /><br />stronger level than the basic premise.  His cold, emotionless, mood-flattened state, perpetuated by required drugs, is dead bang on target.  Equally, he convinces you he is a man with a mission, and you feel his near agony, as he is flooded with feeling once again.<br /><br />High marks on the visual blocking of the film and the evocative sets that set the tone for the whole film.</p></body></html>

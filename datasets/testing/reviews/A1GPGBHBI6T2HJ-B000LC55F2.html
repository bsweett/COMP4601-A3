<meta name="summary" content="Surprising ending -- that is if you don't figure it out first..."></head><body><p>I saw Hugh Jackman on Jay Leno talking about The Prestige and the shocking ending, and after seeing a trailer for it, I was determined to see this Magical Mystery Tour myself.  I liked virtually everything about the movie, even when I had no idea where it was going...however, just knowing in advance that the ending was supposed to be a giant surprise, I was paying extra attention.  Now I am not sure whether or not it was because of this that I caught on to a few things that later helped me to deduce the eventual outcome of the story, but even so that is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The story flowed differently from what you may normally expect from a fairly large budgeted film.  Showing us clips out of sequence may sound confusing, but never fear, the Director, Christopher Nolan held the reigns close to keep you seeing exactly what he wanted you to see, and when you would see it.  After a tragic accident that causes the death of his wife, Hugh Jackman (I find it easier to refer to them this way) teeters dangerously over the edge of sane reasoning in his quest to see to it that Christian Bale suffers serious consequences for his negligence in tying a knot that was supposed to be easily undone behind the curtain.  This goes from outright attempts at murder, to trying to out-do him on stage.<br /><br />It is easy to see that Hugh's character is the more polished of the two, and yet it isn't enough.  Christian knows how to perform incredibly clever illusions which seem to dazzle way more than anything Hugh can come up with.  Thus the quest to *discover* Christian's secret ferments until it becomes a full-fledged obsession.  Stealing the trick isn't beneath him, either.  But even though he is able to *copy* Christian's trick of the Transported Man on stage, Hugh still feels 2nd rate because deep down he still has no real clue as to HOW it is done...and this is driving him quite mad.<br /><br />Hugh's obsession forces him to virtually abandon almost everything in order to make Christian pay for his wife's death.  Since the tragic accident, Christian has moved on, married and even had a child, while Hugh continues to seeth at the loss he should not have had to bear.  Revenge is a tricky thing, however.  It leads Hugh to do some nasty things in order to force Christian to divulge his Transported Man secret.  This leads him to Nikola Tesla in the mountains of Colorado.  His experiments with electricity has made him legendary, but also viewed as a bit of an eccentric as well.  Hugh will stop virtually nothing in his attempts to have Tesla create for him a way to scientifically counter the Transported Man, all the while creating his own legacy that will hopefully live forever after his death.<br /><br />Several *secrets* to how the story ends are revealed as a result of Hugh visiting Colorado.  Don't worry, I won't spoil anything here, but for those of you who pride yourself in figuring out complicated plots, especially when telegraphed rather early on, well you may not find the last frame of the movie to be a surprise at all.  However, if by any chance you miss some of these *clues* and they ARE there, the final second of this movie has the potential to shock you as much as the ending to the 6th Sense may have.  I am by NO means a plot-deciphering genius by ANY stretch of the imagination, however I was still able to make my own mind up a good 40 minutes before the movie ended about what the eventual outcome was going to be, and while I didn't get everything 100% the general shock that you are left with did NOT surprise me.  I sincerely wish it had, because I would have enjoyed the movie that much more.<br /><br />I also feel compelled to let those who see this movie know that the plot borders on the Supernatural and even skirts the realm of science fiction a tad...maybe because of these two factors I was able to make my deduction so easily (because I enjoy sci-fi, maybe it was easier to accept the outcome...maybe not).  All I know is that if you are NOT into the Supernatural or a shade of sci-fi, The Prestige just may not be for you.  I still enjoyed the acting, the pacing and it is always nice to see Michael Caine do what he does best -- even if his role reminded me of a dozen other characters he has played in the past.  Good luck, and hopefully the ending WILL surprise you more than it did me.</p></body></html>

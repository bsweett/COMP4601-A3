<meta name="summary" content="Quite Possibly The Best Parody Ever!"></head><body><p>This is definitely one of the best comedies of all time, I can't help but laugh every time that I watch this great film. Mel Brooks definitely comes through again with this hilarious parody of Frankenstein. The script is funny and the look of the film looks like it was made in the 1930s. Gene Wilder is the star of the film, but the jokes really go to Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman as the monster and Eyegor. This film has definitely proven itself over the years and is just as fresh as the day it first was released. If you never see another Mel Brooks movie in your life, I highly recommend this. Trust me, you will love it!</p></body></html>

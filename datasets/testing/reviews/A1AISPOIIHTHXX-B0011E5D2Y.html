<meta name="summary" content="Nice buddy comedy movie, it's not a raunchy one btw"></head><body><p>That was actually my first reaction to the film: it's not a raunchy comedy? The film is actually a situation comedy with swears and sex-related humor rather than just flatout grossness like American Pie. It ends up working because of the chemistry of the characters and some humor.<br /><br />John and Jeremy are wedding crashers, people who sneak into weddings pretending to be part of the group and impressing everyone and going home with a woman. Fake names and occupations are thrown out so they can have the best possible time. John however is starting to feel a little bit empty about it.<br /><br />Cue in the Treasury leader hosting a wedding for his daughter. Biggest wedding ever so why not crash that one too? Only this family is quite an odd one and they both find that out as Jeremy has a really oversexed girl Gloria while John meets Claire, the normal one but is with someone else(who, in a stereotypical role) is the "jealous and bitter" boyfriend.<br /><br />I think that's one problem I had with it: it's got too many comedy conventions. If you've seen a romantic comedy ever you know that guy does something to screw up and girl doesn't like him while guy tries to get her back and girl accepts. Come on people, I'm not spoiling anything. Also it's slightly underwritten. Jane Seymour playing the unfaithful wife of the Treasury head doesn't really do anything and pretty much just drops out.<br /><br />The film does work for the chemistry, not only in the 2 leading men but with their respective women. A standout is Isla Fisher playing the incredibly enthusiastic Gloria. While of course Christopher Walken is awesome, you just feel you could've needed more Walken(I refuse to do a cowbell-like joke involving more Walken).<br /><br />I found this funnier than 40 Year Old Virgin actually but still, could've used slightly more script work. Ever so slightly.</p></body></html>

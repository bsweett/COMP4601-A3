<meta name="summary" content="Satisfying finish the the X-Men series"></head><body><p>I liked the first 2 movies in the series, and this one competently carries the franchise forward.  Many of the same guys return for a final fight to preserve mutants from extinction.  The addition of the Beast played by Kelsey Grammer was a nice addition as well.  The plot moves along nicely and is not overwhelming with action.  My biggest complaint was there was not a good villian or foil for Wolverine.  In the first movie he had Sabertooth and in the second he had Deathstrike and Mystique.  In this one he deals a bit with Juggernaut, but I would have liked to see more Wolverine humor.  Regardless, it is well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disapointing"></head><body><p>GOing into this movie I expected a well done Zombie movie, since it was helmed by the master of all Zombie movies George A. Romero.  However, I very disappointed.  This film seemed to be more of a way to cash in on his past work.  There is no character development in this film.  The good guys aren't very sympethicly good, and we don't learn anything new about why or how the zombies are the dead alive. And why they are starting to act like they use to when they were alive.</p></body></html>

It's a real lowball indie. Grandpa is a junkie. Junior is depressed and doesn't speak. Momma and pappa have problems. Guess who is the only normal one? Um, the 10 year old girl of the title. She's bent on performing in a beauty pageant, despite sporting a gut like a mini Hulk Hogan. No real plot to speak of, so you are left to enjoy the individual performances. Again, the little girl is the most impressive of the bunch. Worth your time, but don't be taken by all the raves. It's just so-so.</p></body></html>

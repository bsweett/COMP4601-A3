I realize those thoughts may or may not be helpful as far as reviewing this project, and if they aren't, they then aren't meant for you.  They're meant for those who are interested in what I'm thinking.<br /><br />If you like comic book movies with plenty of action and some thought (not unlike the X-Men series, though not as deep), you will enjoy this movie as I did.  It may lack in plot originality, but it makes up for that with enjoyable and likable protagonists.<br /><br />This movie is one that lives and dies with heroes you enjoy rooting for, a villain (or more) who you love to detest, and special effects that help you believe the unbelievable.  This movie succeeds on all three counts.  Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba are engaging in their roles, and Chris Evans' Tiggerish Johnny Storm plays great with Michael Chiklis as The Thing a.k.a. Eeyore.  Julian McMahon is chilling as Doctor Doom.  (I think it helps that the actors are not household names.)  And the special effects are fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, and fantastic (note my little attempt at humor here?).<br /><br />Kerry Washington's casting as Alicia Masters is ingenious.  True, she does not resemble the comic book character physically, but neither do the rest of the cast (e.g. the original Johnny Storm is blonde, unlike Evans; the original Ben Grimm has hair, unlike Chiklis).  Having a black Alicia dating a white (okay, orange) Ben Grimm/Thing points out that what matters is not appearance but what is inside the person.<br /><br />Finally, what about the kiddos?  I didn't notice any bad language (which the latter X-Men movies slipped into), and the violence was comic bookish.  There was no sex, though they managed to show some of Jessica Alba's skin in a couple of scenes.  As I say with all movies and TV shows, parents need to accompany their children if seeing this, but I think children past the age of, let's say seven, can handle this with parental presence and feedback.<br /><br />This concludes my review of the movie per se.  Allow me to give some thoughts.  If you want to vote on whether this is helpful, please base it on the above, not on the below.  Also, if you don't want to spoil the movie, please stop reading the review at this point, because I will be spoiling some of the story from this point on.<br /><br />As stated, this movie lacks some originality.  It may be that it borrowed from other sources, or it could be that the similarities between other movies are unintentional.  One example is the similarity between the villainization of Victor Von Doom here and Norman Osborn in the Spiderman movie (though from what I know, the Fantastic Four is more original, without borrowing from the comic books for the climax as Spiderman did).  Also, for those who can remember 24 years back to Superman II, the humanization and back of Ben Grimm may remind you of Superman becoming human and regaining his powers.  Other movie similarities include the pigeon leaving his mark on Ben Grimm and the dog leaving his mark on Dan Ackroyd's Winthrop in "Trading Places" or Johnny Storm taking out the heatseeking missles with similar strategies in "X2" and "Blue Thunder".  This may be laziness and quasi-plagarism (though to plagarize from many sources can also be called research), or this may be either an unconscious copying or thinking of something not knowing it's been done before.<br /><br />It's obvious there will be a sequel -- in fact, I saw the preview today on a program I taped earlier this week.  I was trying to guess which villain would be next, or if they would bring back Doom.  My guesses of possible new villains were the Puppet Master, the Sub-Mariner, the Frightful Four (introducing the Inhumans, including Johnny's girlfriend Crystal) and the shape changing Skrull.  I forgot all about Galactacus and the Silver Surfer.<br /><br />Let me now move to lessons learned from this movie.  This movie focuses on related subjects of teamwork and friendship.  Also, as a preacher, I can see the devilish side of Dr. Doom.  I'm speaking specifically of how he deceives Ben Grimm and makes a rift between him and Reed Richards.  The devil does the same thing to divide Christians, for the purpose of achieving his goal, which includes the destruction of the individual Christian, easier to do when they are isolated from their fellow believers.</p></body></html>

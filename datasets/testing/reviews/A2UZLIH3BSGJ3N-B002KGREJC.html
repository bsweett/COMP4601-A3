<meta name="summary" content=""I'm not really sure what kind of girl I am.""></head><body><p>This is a film I had wanted to see when it was in theaters, but I just wasn't able to make it. Juno (not the town in Alaska) is a story about a teenage girl going through the process of an unplanned pregnancy. Not being able to go through with an abortion, Juno seeks out an alternative means..."adoption" but on her own terms. There she seeks out and finds the Lorings (Jason Bateman, Jenifer Garner) as the quintessential parents. The Lorings are a well to do(very yuppie), upper class couple who are childless and have been unsucessful in having there own children. Vanessa Loring (either unable to have a baby or not wanting to endure pregnancy-I wasn't sure which at first?) deeply, madly, desperately wants to have a family and be a mother. So, over the next several months, Juno goes through the motions and growing pains of pregnancy, all the while coming to terms and to her own realizations of motherhood,couples and relationships. Juno ponders on finding that one person who will love you no matter what, and not put into more simpler terms other than, "pretty,ugly,thin,fat,handsome,no matter what...the right person will think the sun still shines out of your ass" put so eloquently by her dear old d,a,d. I really enjoyed this film. I loved Juno's off color,dry and quirky sense of humor and especially her insight (from a girls perspective).Ellen Page is also turning out to be a great actress, plus...she's pretty damm cute to boot and perfectly cast as the main character. Well worth watching and owning, Juno is one of those rare gems (especially being a teen targeted film) that actually has quite a bit of substance to it rather than pointless,shallower, more intelligence draining teen films made in the past. Well worth watching with a nice message delivered at the end,it was a really cute story about an otherwise sensitive subject.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is Dark Water a psychological suspense film or a horror flick?"></head><body><p>I guess for me it was more of a psychological suspense story than a horror flick and that's why their was no real scares in the movie. And if people watched it expecting chills down their spine were probably disappointed. Me, as a single mom who raised her kids with no help from dad, I felt bad for Dahlia. And because of my own life may have read too much into a simple thriller.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good"></head><body><p>As seeing so many disastrous disaster films, with only a few exceptions, I had put off seeing this for a long time. But, this film is pretty good. Yes, some of it is predictable, but there are also some novel ideas presented. Much of it is believable. The action is not edge-of-your-seat, but it is nail-biting at times.</p></body></html>

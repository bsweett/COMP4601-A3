<meta name="summary" content="Just release that darn Kraken already!"></head><body><p>Does anyone else feel that the "Release the Kraken" line has been used way too much in all the TV adds and trailers? Other than those three words, I was quite looking forward to Clash of the Titans. I have never seen the 1981 version, even though I tried renting the Blu-ray prior to seeing this remake, but it's not in stock anywhere. Those looking for high art are at the wrong movie, but if you want some B movie popcorn fun, this might do the trick. Parts of it reminded me of the mess that was 10,000 B.C., but it never quite gets that bad.<br /><br />The acting is slightly better than I had read about from critics. Sam Worthington is okay, though a bit too bland. He was much better in Terminator: Salvation and Avatar. I'm still not sure if this guy has star quality or not. Liam Neeson (Zeus) and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) both turn in performances worthy of a movie with better writing, but they manage to do the most with the average script. Same goes for Mads Mikkelsen (Draco). As far as the ladies go, Gemma Arterton (lo) and Alexa Devalos (Andromeda) are nice to look at for sure, but Arterton's character is more interesting, mainly because she is actually given things to do.<br /><br />Movies like this live and die by the CGI. About half of it works, but some is very mediocre. Nothing reaches the depths of The Scorpion King look in The Mummy Returns, but at least that has the excuse of coming out in 2001. Which leads me to the 3-D. If given the choice of 2-D or 3-D, I don't mind paying double the price for this popular format, but I'm glad I listened to the critics and other movie goers who have said that the rushed 3-D job here stinks. At least Alice in Wonderland had a lot of time put into it's upconvert. I heard they spent only two months or so on Clash of the Titans, leaving the film looking too dark and turning the action scenes into nothing more than headache starters. Take it from me, I saw it in 2-D, saved five bucks, and thought it looked good.<br /><br />I love Greek mythology, with all the cool creatures that go along with it, and I'm currently hacking and slashing my way through God of War III, so Clash of the Titans was fully entertaining in my eyes, but this movie needed more effort in the script and CGI department. Still, it's fun and worth seeing on the BIG screen. In fact, I'm not sure if they should have made this movie any less silly. Perhaps that's exactly what it's suppose to be.<br /><br />Perseus may be the son of Zeus here, but Kratos will always be my God slayer.</p></body></html>

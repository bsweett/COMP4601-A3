<meta name="summary" content="Weak tea"></head><body><p>Doubt is probably a good play rendered banal by the movie screen. There's just not enough of the play, which is a series of dialogues, to fit a feature film. Nonetheless, the substance of the work packs something of a wallop, emphasizing how moral certainty does very little to serve a relentlessly relativistic universe.<br /><br />You will probably not be bowled over by Doubt because of its vehicle, but the theme has resonance and the content will not leave you until you have sorted it out. I guess this could be seen as anti-religious in a way, but I think that the characters are just useful platforms for a truth that transcends faith and churchgoing and whatnot.<br /><br />Judge ye not. A hard lesson to learn, but hey, that's the stuff of theatre. See it, and be patient with the movie itself because it's not all that great.</p></body></html>

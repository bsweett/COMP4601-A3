<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Football movies!"></head><body><p>Actor Peter Berg gets behind the camera and takes us on a journey to the west Texas town of Odessa.  His movie is more than about football.  It's about a way of life for a small town and the pressure the towns people put on these young boys to strive and win the biggest prize, a state championship.  Berg's direction is outstanding.  I really liked the fact that he wasn't concentrating on glitz and glamour.  It wasn't a typical Hollywood production.  There are no heroes, just people who are flawed.  Country singer Tim McGraw shows his star power as the troubled dad aof a football player.  Billy Bob once again shows his greatness as the football coach under pressure to win "State".  It's an outstanding film that was based on a true story shows us there's more important things than football such as enjoying life.</p></body></html>

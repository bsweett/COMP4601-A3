<meta name="summary" content="Classic film noir, set in a sci-fi universe."></head><body><p>If I told you this was a story of an unjustly accused cop, on the run trying to clear himself and uncover a conspiracy, you'd roll your eyes and think, "Not again!" It's one of the oldest plots that exist.<br />Not that it can't be compelling, but you've "been there, done that."<br />This is that story, set in a world we haven't yet seen in film, a tweak on our current age filmed in a bleached out color combo.<br />This totally works. All cylinders firing like mad. Good performances, interesting plot, superb twists and slick but unobtrusive effects.<br />It may put off those who aren't "open" to sci-fi in general, but if that sounds like you, THIS should be one you should at least try out.<br />Go with it, and it'll take you to cool places.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SO SO EXPLOITATIVE FILM"></head><body><p>An homage to the zombie genre and old exploitation films. There's some cute moments in here (the one legged woman) but I think I prefer the old original movies flavor wise. This isn't really terrifying and tries to go for the dark humor of the genre and sometimes succeeds. But overall this film made me wanting to watch something else but I was surfing the Web as I did it so it didn't matter too much. STORY/PLOTTING; C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS: B minus;<br />GENRE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2011.</p></body></html>

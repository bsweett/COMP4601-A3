I totally left all that I knew about it at home and gave my all to the story that was both creepy and modern in John Moore's version of the Anti-Christ "reborn" in a man, or should I say little boys flesh.<br /><br />I loved the color schemes of the whole movie with the dark cloudy weather, the gray and beige castle that the Thorns called home and splashes of red used to provoke memories of danger lurking ahead, such classic ways to spice up a story that was really captivating with unreal flashbacks to nightmares, blood and hooded demons that crept up the lives of an innocent pair. The story is well known to those familiar but in brief description to the curious I will divulge a super quick summary.<br /><br />In Rome an American diplomat an his wife, Robert and Katherine Thorn welcome a baby boy  to their world, but little do they know about the origins of that baby. Katherine supposingly had a very difficult delivery that resulted in death of the child and unknowns to her, a priest at the hospital offers Robert a baby boy whose mother died in childbirth at the same time that Katherine was in her labor. Robert takes the baby boy, pretends that it is theirs because it was all his wife ever wanted and they go on from there only to meet death and destruction for what seemed like a saved situation. The movie follows the boy, Damien who starts to show strange behavior starting with his 6th birthday party and that's when things go form bad to worse.<br /><br />I will agree that the original Damian was both melancholy and menacing with his cold silver blue eyes, and was much better than Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick who did some good smirks and threw a fit when close to a church, but I didn't let that one thing spoil my movie.<br /><br />I loved watching people jump in their seats and scream out, it made me laugh, only because if I'm going to see a horror movie, I know better than let things slip out of me like that, and I enjoyed seeing others have a reaction that horror movies makes us crave. Overall this was very good, and I liked Liev Schreiber, Mia Farrow and even Julian Styles, who did much better than I expected and certain scenes such as the one in the cemetery with the falling snow were really well done. The death scenes were ultra gruesome because they were so realistic but they just gave this movie more depth. I enjoyed this and I'm really looking forward to seeing what unravels from where the story leaves, for I know more gruesome yummies are on the way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One hundred words on a drama that's expertly crafted, thrilling, and smart"></head><body><p>"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" combines several genres- an Agatha Christie style whodunit, a serial killer thriller, a foreign art house drama, an edgy Eurotrash movie, and an American style buddy adventure- into a fine, compelling film that assumes that audiences don't need endless action and a relentless pace to stay interested.  While I had no problem with the subtitled, Swedish language version of the film I saw in the theater, the DVD offers both that version and a dubbed English version, which is actually fairly polished.  Sometimes horrifying, sometimes very moving, always interesting, this film shouldn't be missed.</p></body></html>

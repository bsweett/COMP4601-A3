<meta name="summary" content="Blu-Ray Edition Really Elevates This Film"></head><body><p>When this came out on DVD, I gave it another shot, after not being too impressed with the VHS the first time. Wow, what a difference!,  Now, the Blu-Ray is out and now the film has taken another giant leap.  It makes the other versions look primitive.<br /><br />On its own - and I'm not a horror movie buff - I found it to be very entertaining and very suspenseful film. Those visuals are so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her "Olive Oyl" face, smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.<br /><br />If you are any kind of a fan of this film, or director Stanley Kubrick's unique style of filmmaking, you owe it to yourself to look at it on this high-definition transfer.  You'll be amazed how great it looks.</p></body></html>

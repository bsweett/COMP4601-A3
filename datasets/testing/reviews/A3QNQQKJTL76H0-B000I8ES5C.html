<meta name="summary" content="Great Blu-ray addition to your collection"></head><body><p>This is an excellent film that crosses a few boundaries. It's first and foremost a kung-fu action movie, fused with numerous comedic moments and slapstick, as well as some heartwarming (and heartbreaking) scenes. The Chinese name for this film is simply "Kung-Fu", but "Hustle" was added to the English name to set it apart for western audiences. Fans of Stephen Chow will recognize many familiar faces and long-running gags. If you're a fan of kung fu movies (and Chinese cinema in general) and haven't seen this yet, you owe it to yourself to buy this disc.<br /><br />I would say this is Chow's most universally accessible film. But like all foreign movies, some things just don't translate and there will be jokes you won't get. Some of the references and imagery are distinctly Chinese and only funny or understandable to Chinese viewers. The abundant insults and cursing (especially by the landlady) are hilarious if you understand Cantonese.<br /><br />Visually, this film is stunning for its representation of 1940's Shanghai, and the transfer to BD does a very good job. Lots of wonderful and clever fight sequences by famed fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, as well as some great use of CG to exaggerate the action which draws inevitable comparisons to the Matrix (which used a lot CG and also involved Yuen).<br /><br />Features-wise, there's a fair amount of extra stuff in here for a Blu-ray disc, including a 42 minute featurette (all Chinese with subtitles), a 30 minute interview with Chow (all English), bloopers, and deleted scenes. The featurette is for Chinese audiences and looks like something taken from HK television. The interview, on the other hand, is aimed at western audiences who are completely new to Chow's work and HK cinema. It seeks to explain a lot of the influences, gestures, and symbolism in the movie for the benefit of American audiences.<br /><br />Avoid the English audio track at all costs. My player defaulted to English and I had to laugh at the really bad voiceovers before switching back to the original Cantonese. The English dub actors all attempt really bad Chinese accents. It's embarrassing and distracting.<br /><br />The other complaint is that the commentary track is several seconds out of sync with the film in certain places. This is quite distracting when they talk about some very specific things like how they accomplished an effect or point out a small detail in the frame that audiences might miss.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great BD to have in your collection.</p></body></html>

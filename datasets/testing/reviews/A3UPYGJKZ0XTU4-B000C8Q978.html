"Broken Flowers" is his latest film on that theme, written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. This time, Don Johnston (Bill Murray), a computer mogul without a computer in his home, receives a mysterious letter just as his live-in girlfriend (Julie Delpy) is leaving him. The letter, composed with a manual typewriter on pink paper, is from a woman claiming to have been Don's lover 20 years before. She announces that Don has a 19-year-old son, who is on a road trip in search of his father. But the letter is unsigned, leaving Don to wonder who might have borne him a son or if it is a hoax. Don's neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright) wonders more than he does, and convinces Don to set out across the country to visit the 5 women who could have been the mother of his child.<br /><br />Bill Murray can certainly play aloof angst. It isn't the extent of his talent, but it is unfortunately sometimes the extent of his characterization. Beyond that, "Broken Flowers" isn't about anything. The characters seem tailored to fulfill their particular roles, which are inconsequential, not to impress anyone as genuine. I kept hoping Winston would reappear, because he is the only character who  seems to be among the living, even though he's not credible either: A working class man who lives in a modest home next door to a multi-million dollar house, speaks with a charming accent, works 3 jobs, and is a meticulous and efficient travel agent for no pay. The film spends an inordinate amount of time staring at Don in his living room or in his car. At least 20 minutes worth of  unnecessary shots should have been trimmed. "Broken Flowers" has just one moment of genuine emotion when Don is overcome by exhaustion and self-pity. I thought about giving the film 3 stars, but that one moment is the only thing I could find to recommend it, and that isn't enough.<br /><br />The DVD (MCA 2006): "Girls on the Bus" (1 ? min) is additional conversation between the 2 teenagers in the bus scene. "Broken Flowers Start to Finish" (7 ? min) follows the filming from scene 1 to 63, skipping some scenes, by showing the clapboards for each scene. There are a few bloopers and a lot of clapboards. "Farm House" (4 min) features behind the scenes footage of the farmhouse scene while writer/director Jim Jarmusch speaks about the film's themes and his intentions. There is also a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Even objectively,  this is a very bad movie."></head><body><p>A cast member is cocooned by the aliens.  He sees a facehugger awakening and struggles and stretches through the gooey material holding him to reach a handgun on the man cocooned to his side.  After a Herculean effort, he reaches the gun and fires right as the facehugger is about to attach itself.  He yells with triumph...but then half a dozen other eggs open up and the camera pans away as we hear gunshots and see muzzle flashes.<br /><br />I highlight this scene because it was the only thing done well in the entire movie.  Aside from this scene, the movie was pure mercenary filth, an attempt to make a quick buck. Most people critisize the screenplay in this type of movie, which of course was awful, but the direction and special effects, and acting were lousy too.  This was just a bad, bad movie.<br /><br />Slow-motion is used in virtually every action scene, a human teams up with a Predator (who, incidentally, taught us how to build pyramids and used us as "cattle" to breed Aliens, their ultimate prey), and a former whaling village isn't found near a shore.  Continuity errors abound, the fight-scenes are chaotic and clumsily-handled, and characters are able to discipher thousands of years of buried history in five minutes so that the audience can have some idea of why Aliens and Predators are dueling in Antartica (and incidentally, we learned in the first movie that the Predator is drawn to heat).  The Predators are not fluidly moving creatures but husky 250 pound football players thumping along, and their once-frightening facial features have been reduced to money-saving masks that look like they were bought from a CVS.<br /><br />Oh, and just in case you figured you'd have a bet with your friends on who'll win, don't bother, the movie decides its better, even in a movie called "Alien Vs. Predator", to have no winner in the battle.  Pathetic.  1.5/10</p></body></html>

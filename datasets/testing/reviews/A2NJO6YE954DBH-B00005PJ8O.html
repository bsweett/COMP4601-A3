Scott's riveting portrayal of the notorious American tank commander.  As a film biography &quot;Patton&quot; forgoes the rise of the celebrated general and merely hints at his ironic death because of injuries suffered in a traffic accident, focuses entirely on his military career commanding troops in North Africa, Sicily and France during World War II.  The strength of the script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, as well as of Scott's performance, is that the paradoxes of Patton are completely embraced.  Not even Patton's loyal cadre of staff officers can keep him from shooting off his mouth every time there are reporters around, but then neither German Field Marshall Rommel or English Field Marshall Montgomery can beat him on the battlefield.  Karl Malden's performance as General Omar Bradley is just as solid as Scott's, presenting a man whose personality is the complete antithesis of Patton.  Viewers find themselves identifying with the German captain who is the intelligence expert on Patton and arguably the only person in the film who really understands or respects the American general.  But the more I watch &quot;Patton,&quot; the more I am very impressed with the battle sequences of director Franklin J. Schaffner (&quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Pappillon&quot;), which were staged live and full-scale without special effects of miniatures.  Schaffner provides not just the large spectacle of a desert tank battle, but smaller and equally memorable moments, such as a soldier falling dead in the snow.  &quot;Patton&quot; deserved its Oscars.<p>In terms of extra features on this DVD, the second disc features the 1997 50-minute retrospective documentary, &quot;The Making of Patton: A Tribute to Franklin J. Schaffner.&quot;  Recent interviews with the cinematographer, composer, etc., are blended with audio interviews of Schaffner and Scott from 1970, newsreel footage of Patton, along with clips and publicity stills from the film make a fitting tribute to the late director.  The audio commentary on the first disc is really more of a lecture on Patton by Charles M. Province, the author of the book &quot;The Unknown Patton&quot; and founder/president of the General George S. Patton, Jr. Historical Society.  Province more than adequately fills in what the movie leaves out about Patton's life.  On the second disc Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar nominated musical score is presented in stereo, including alternate takes and a series of radio spots.  You certainly have to appreciate what Fox has put together here: This is a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD priced as a regular DVD, a real treat for those of us who remember being mesmerized by George C. Scott giving that profanity laced opening speech standing in front of that giant American flag.</p></body></html>

These men pay the oh-so-cool Hitch to teach them how to capture the hearts of women.  Hitch is good at it, too, an impressive number of his clients have gotten 'hitched' to the ladies of their dreams.<br /><br />What happens when Hitch himself falls in love?  The man certainly needs help--but more than anything he needs to learn how to be himself to impress his lady.<br /><br />"Hitch" is a good afternoon's fun and definitely worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="hard stuff"></head><body><p>Hard Candy is a really tricky suspense. You see it starts off rather bland and predictable for the first 20 minutes as a young girl (played by the wonderfully underrated Ellen Page) meets up with a guy she's been communicating with online, then...<br /><br />The plot *completely* changes and becomes much much better.<br /><br />She's convinced the guy has been touching children inappropriately and even taking pictures of them and hiding the pictures somewhere around the house.  Ellen Page's character then goes totally ballistic. Okay I kind of made an unintentional joke using the word "ballistic". I swear I didn't realize that until after I said it.<br /><br />I really don't want to spoil the storyline unlike a few other reviewers below who made no effort whatsoever to hide what eventually happens, so be VERY CAREFUL reading the reviews below mine.<br /><br />Let's just say, the man who plays the 32-year old perverted photographer is absolutely stupid and constantly falls victim to Page's antics.  There's definitely a handful of unrealistic moments, but who cares.<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal, and Ellen Page truly proves exactly WHY she's so deserving of lead role whether she's performing in comedies (Juno) or suspenseful, shocking films like this one. Any other female playing lead role wouldn't have been nearly as effective.<br /><br />Edge of your seat suspense at its very finest. Hardy Candy is a really good, and dare I say, *original* type of suspense. Usually it's a crazy, murderous guy chasing the girl around playing mind games and being incredibly cruel, NOT the other way around. The plot is wonderful and suspenseful. A must see.</p></body></html>

Tale focuses on a bunch of oil riggers stranded in snowy Alaska after a plane crash. Only a handful of them survived and they are lacking in the bare necessities while a wolf pack tracks them down, picking them off one by one. The survivors desperately try to get away and seek a safer venue. Liam Neeson is the main star of this film with a somewhat good to good supporting cast. Neeson plays the expert on wolves attempting to give advice to the survivors who are in over their heads and half the time bickering with one another or failing to take the wolf situation seriously enough.<br /><br />Part of the "fun" is seeing how the "oh so clever" wolves pick people off. The actions and strategies of the wolves are controversial. Uninformed people act like wolves never attack people out in remote areas but if you do some research you will see the movie isn't always wrong in how it depicts wolf activities. Now, are they are smart as shown in the film? Probably not. Some are arguing the wolves are symbolisms for the Grip Reaper coming to get us but that is another discussion.<br /><br />In the end if you accept the possibility that wolves could attack a group of wounded humans then this is a fun survival tale with a gruesome ending. BTW, it was marketed as an action film in some circles and that is totally dead wrong. They filmed this picture in 40 days and it was based on a short story by Ian MacKenzie.<br /><br />Wolf lovers have boycotted this film arguing wolves never attack people but that's inaccurate and up to major discussions on the forums.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; SURVIVAL SCENES: B to B plus; WOLF PACK DEPICTIONS: B to B (higher if you aren't seeking 100% accuracy); WHEN WATCHED: late June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.</p></body></html>

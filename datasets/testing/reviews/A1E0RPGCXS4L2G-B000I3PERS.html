The battle scenes were very realistic for the time frame, even sometimes to the point of shock.  If you don't like violence you will probably have to leave the room during these scenes.  But they help set the harsh world in which William Wallace lived.  While this movie is not historically correct it is an interesting period piece.  And a wonderful love story.  For those that say a man can not love as deep as a woman, this love story seems to beg to differ.  There is something for both &quot;him and her&quot; in this movie and you can watch with your spouse or friend.  <p>The movie was long but time passed quickly.  The story surrounds you from the very beginning and never lets you out until the very end.  There are all kinds of heros and villans, damsels in distress, warriors, kings and tyrants throughout this movie.  The soundtrack was very good (I bought it on CD) and enhanced the overall effect of the movie.  The story, the excellent acting, the battle scenes, the soundtrack, the plot.  All lead to create a movie that stands head and shoulders above most recent ventures of any type.  <p>Buy it or rent it but absolutely you should see it.</p></body></html>

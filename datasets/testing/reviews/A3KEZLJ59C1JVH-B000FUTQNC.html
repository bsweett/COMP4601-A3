<meta name="summary" content=""Firewall" fails to impress"></head><body><p>I think the producers of "Firewall" really wanted to capitalize on the popularity of "Air Force One" by making another movie where Harrison Ford tries to save his family from a bunch of bad guys. In this case, Ford's character is Jack Stanfield, a bank security specialist whose family is held hostage by a group of bank robbers. The robbers want Jack to help them steal millions of dollars from the bank by cracking into the network's security system.<br /><br />The premise of the film is interesting, but the first two-thirds of the movie really drag. The thing that bothers me the most about the film is that so much of the drama is underplayed. When the robbers break into the Stanfield house, Jack's wife, Beth (Virginia Madsen), is completely freaked out at first, but less than 15 minutes later, she's calmly making breakfast with everyone and chit-chatting with her kidnappers around the kitchen table. Similarly, little Andy (Jimmy Bennett) has no qualms about laughing and making pancakes with his captor the morning after the break-in. Is that normal behavior fom a six-year-old boy? I don't think so. I think the underplaying was a conscious choice on the part of the screenwriter and the director, and it was a poor one.<br /><br />Eventually, the film picks up the pace during the last 40 minutes or so. Ford does some impressive stunts and has some amusing scenes with Janet, his administrative assistant (Mary Lynn Rajskub), but that's about it. "Firewall" is disappointingly dull and predictable. I'm sorry that I wasted two hours of my life watching it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two Minutes Until ..."></head><body><p>It's risky for a story to intentionally fool with time, specifically a linear sequence of events; the end result will be either a uniquely constructed narrative or a convoluted mess. "Next"--based on Philip K. Dick's short story "The Golden Man"--is about a man who has the ability to see two minutes into his own future, which is just enough of a heads up to prevent certain things from happening. The idea is enough to attract anyone's attention, and thank goodness that it actually redeems itself by the end of the film; while nowhere near as complex or thought provoking as last summer's Philip K. Dick adaptation--"A Scanner Darkly"--it still manages to be a thoroughly entertaining story, a pre-summer popcorn flick with an engaging plot and decent performances.<br /><br />The film opens in Las Vegas, where Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) headlines a magic show under the alias Frank Cadillac. When not on stage, he gambles at local casinos, puffing on cigarettes while trying to manipulate his odds of hitting jackpots. He is, of course, under constant surveillance, and on this particular night, his antics go a little too far, prompting Security to intervene. The situation is made worse when he envisions a casino shooting and prevents it from happening; he makes himself look guilty, and he's forced to escape. This sequence is loaded with plausibility problems; even if you have the ability to peak into the future, it's still impossible to escape the ever-present surveillance cameras (I should know; I've been to Vegas many times). Not only can Security see his every move, they also follow him closely as he darts around the casino. Yet he escapes with ease. He also manages to steal someone's car.<br /><br />Luckily, the rest of the film succeeds in overshadowing this sequence. This is when FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is introduced; she's had her eye on Johnson ever since learning of an international threat against America. A group of Russian terrorists have stolen a nuclear warhead and plan to detonate it in Los Angeles, which will result in the deaths of eight million people. Johnson's precognitive abilities are perfectly suited for preventing a disaster of this magnitude, which is why she feels justified in forcing him to cooperate. After all, it's not about him: it's about saving millions of lives.<br /><br />Johnson, as you might expect, is not anxious to be a pawn of the American government. The most obvious solution is for him to leave Vegas and hide in some remote part of the country. But he can't. This is because, for reasons he can't explain, he's been having visions of a young woman in a local diner, and he simply has to meet her and find out why. This is a troubling situation; when it comes to this mystery woman, he can see far beyond two minutes into the future. It's never adequately explained, even when he finally does meet her after months of visiting the diner, sitting at the counter and sipping away at martinis (you usually don't associate martinis with diners, but I digress). Her name is Liz (Jessica Biel), and she befriends Johnson when he disrupts a confrontation between her and her controlling ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />It isn't until the two meet that Johnson finally decides to flee Vegas; they both travel to Flagstaff, Arizona, where Liz teaches at a local Native American reservation. Unbeknownst to them both, Agent Ferris and her team are hot on their trail. The same can be said for the Russian terrorists; Johnson is a threat that must be eliminated at any cost.<br /><br />Parts of this film play like scenes from a run-of-the-mill Espionage Thriller, much like the material of a James Bond story: we have the dastardly plot to destroy a major city; we have the international bad guys; we have the lone figure who has the ability to stop them. This was actually more of a distraction than anything else, which may be bothersome to those who have read the original Philip K. Dick story; to say that this adaptation is unfaithful to its source would be an understatement. But in all honesty, a comparison is completely unnecessary. I say this because the screen story stands on it's own, and for the most part, it works. Johnson is a fascinating character--someone both blessed and cursed with a supernatural ability that could be used for humanity's benefit. But how would it benefit him? "If I help you," he says after he's caught by the FBI and restrained in front of a TV screen, "you'll keep me strapped to this chair forever." He has a point; he may be able to foil this nuclear threat, but it would mean the loss of his personal freedom.<br /><br />The final sequences of the film follow a fairly routine structure: Johnson teams up with the FBI hoping to save both the population of Los Angeles and Liz, who has since been kidnapped by the Russians. Johnson's ability is used to its fullest at this point; this is a treat for the audience, especially during a climactic sequence in an industrial complex. All this paves the way for an end sequence that I didn't see coming. I won't go so far as to call it a twist ending, but I will say that it was unique. I don't know if the same can be said for "Next" as a whole, but so what? It was entertaining just the same.</p></body></html>

The film suffers from contrived situations and phoned-in efforts of two of the leads (a too twitchy John Travolta, who overacts, and Tim Allen, who's been letting me down a lot lately). Meanwhile, Martin Lawrence is his normal hit and miss comedic self. William H. Macy is the fourth lead and carries WILD HOGS on his reliable shoulders, here providing a hefty bulk of the film's hilarious scenes. I don't think I exaggerate when I state that Mr. Macy can do no wrong as an actor. He embellishes his portrayal of a nebbish, klutzy computer geek with a layer of sensitivity and naive soulfulness. He's very endearing in his haplessness. To me, the most honest moments in the film come in Macy's tongue-tied but heartfelt romancing of the lovely Marisa Tomei, who, by the way, is the second most appealing performer here.<br /><br />SERIOUS SPOILERS begin:<br /><br />WILD HOGS is a rallying road picture for the downtrodden middle-aged menfolk, a CITY SLICKERS for the new millennium (but not as consistently charming or funny). When Woody, an in-trouble businessman (Travolta) decides to forget his troubles, he manages to talk his longtime buddies into taking a stab at the wild freedom as exercised by bike gangs who live free off the land. Woody intends for his bike-riding Wild Hogs pals to do this by taking a cross-country trip on their Harleys and fending for themselves on the road and without their cell phones. The three other 40-something members of this part-time bike "gang" consist of Doug (Allen), a dentist with dietary prohibitions whose family treats him with fond and absentminded scorn, Bobby (Martin Lawrence), a plumber and the very portrait of emasculation (he's so henpecked he lies to his wife and tells her he's going to a toilet bowl seminar), and Dudley (William H. Macy), a clueless but very affable computer expert who insists on having motorcycle mishaps.<br /><br />But an early sampling of life on the wild side only offers up inclement weather, a marshmallow-induced conflagration, poop in a bag, and birds in the face. Then, a misconstrued conversation and the vision of men sharing the same sleeping bag threaten to land the four in hot water with a seemingly disapproving patrolman (a tightly uniformed John C. McGinley). Later on, these four in deep water threaten to land them in a sleeping bag with the same patrolman. Know what I mean?<br /><br />Soon after, a poorly conceived excursion into a real biker bar gets the guys in trouble as they run afoul of a local bike gang, the Del Fuegos, the leader of which (Ray Liotta, who, surprise, has another intimidatingly intense role) goes on a rant about bike-riding poseurs and then exacts punishment from the Hogs. However, Woody refuses to slink back to his white collar world and opts to do something retaliatory. The film then, more or less, takes a break from its travelogue tone as it hones in on the Wild Hogs frenziedly coping with the consequences of Woody's actions.<br /><br />END SPOILERS.<br /><br />Detractors of the film will find much to back up their claims: the lackluster performances (Travolta as a lead is wasted), a certain lack of chemistry among the leads, and the uninspired storyline. To me, however, this is simply a case of the truly funny moments actually outweighing the negatives and swinging my vote towards a favorable response. I'll be honest: yes, I noticed the flaws, but I was having so much fun in the theater I was able to magnanimously overlook them. Granted, some of the humor is forced and some just doesn't work (c'mon, what person above 7 years old really finds munching on a butter stick funny?). And, granted, I expected more from the all-star cast as the only ones who I felt earned their paychecks were Macy, Tomei, and Liotta - oh, and I also enjoyed the droll musical bits with Tenacious D's Kyle Gass. Travolta needs to pay better attention to future scripts (that, or brush up on his acting) or he just might take a tumble down to the same tier of acting purgatory in which Allen and Lawrence inhabit.<br /><br />WILD HOGS is inundated with poop jokes, gay jokes, bull slapping, gags involving items hitting people's personal areas...you know, low brow stuff. Now, that could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your preference and juvenile mindset. However, the dubiousness of certain aspects of the comedy is thankfully offset by several genuinely laugh-out-loud sequences, two of my favorites being the early scene of Macy on his computer while in a coffee shop and the chuckle-icious closing credit sequence. You probably know going in that this film won't stretch your intellect, no. But there's a chance it might elicit hearty chuckles out of your gut. In my opinion, it's worth watching the film if only to savor William H. Macy's engaging take on Dudley and the sweet comeliness of Marisa Tomei. Liotta, too, has his moments.<br /><br />One legendary biker advises the Hogs to either "ride hard or go home." WILD HOGS, despite the cinematic pot holes, rides hard enough. Three and a half stars.</p></body></html>

Bryan Singer brings his gee-wizardry to the mothballed Superman series and then utterly fails to add anything new. In fact, he barely can disguise the fact that he has - in essence - remade the first Christopher Reeves' "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J">Superman</a>" with a time-line update or two. Brandon Routh (who seemed to get the part because of his uncanny resemblance to Reeves) returns to Earth after a futile five year search for the remnants of Krypton. He discovers that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, looking far too young for the part) has moved on, got a fiance and had a son. She even kissed Superman off with a Pulitzer Prize editorial called "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman."<br /><br />And then there's Lex Luthor. Using the five years that Superman has vanished to bilk an aging billionairess of all her money, he is back to plotting Lutherland again. I was all but waiting for the terrific Parker Posey to blubber "But Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack" as Luther (a malevolent and humorless Kevin Spacey) describes how millions, no, BILLIONS will die as he floods the continent.<br /><br />It's all pretty obvious where this is headed, no? If you're old enough to remember seeing the first Christopher Reeves version, then little of this will surprise you. Everyone plays their parts well (with the exception of Bosworth as Lane) and some of the minor casting is excellent (Frank Langella and Eva Marie Saint in particular). The crashing jet is a great opening for the film and does get "Superman Returns" off to a flying start, but there is just too much retread here to raise this above average. Here's hoping Singer, who has proven himself to be a far better movie-maker than this, gets a crack at the sequel. Should he manage that, I am hoping he can move past the cliches and deliver a Superman that is as original and as vibrant as the 70's movies he so obviously admires.<br /><br />Another nice touch - the dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeves.<br /><br />Incidentally, this DVD has NO extras. Not even a trailer or previews. Nada, nutting. For a full price DVD, that's a bit of a gyp,</p></body></html>

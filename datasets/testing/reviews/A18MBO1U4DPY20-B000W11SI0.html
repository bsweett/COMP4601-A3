<meta name="summary" content="WORTH WATCHING TWICE.."></head><body><p>This movie stands out due to the excellent acting of the lead character and how well it manages to reflect on the lives of Jews(especially) and others caused harm by the war. Adrien Brody plays a role of a lifetime.The storyline and screenplay are quite solid.My favourite dialogue in the film would be where Wladek on his way to a camp tells his sister "I wish I knew you better" That summed up a lot for me.This film lasts for around 2 hours 20 minutes and had just about the right balance of timing and screenplay to notch up in itself a winner.<br /><br />Watch it!</p></body></html>

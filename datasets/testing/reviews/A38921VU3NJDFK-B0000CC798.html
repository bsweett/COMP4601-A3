<meta name="summary" content="X2: X-Men United (2003) [Blu-ray]"></head><body><p>Bryan Singer, who became a Marvel Master after just one film adaptation of the classic comics, follows X-Men with this engaging sequel, which is as profound and intelligent as it is visually impressive and audience-pleasing. Despite introducing the blue-skinned, teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler, and becoming more action-alert than the first film, X2's spotlight is shone on Logan/Wolverine as he inches closer to uncovering the truth behind his past. But before he can do so, he must match wits with the iniquitous scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox), whose past is as murky and mingled as Logan's own.<br /><br />Singer's continuation of the eventual trilogy (not counting the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine)--one that ended with 2006's unworthy The Last Stand (which Singer opted out of to direct Superman Returns)--was one of 2003's top-grossing box-office hits, raking in over $85 million in its first weekend alone and nearly $215 million all-together, far exceeding its predecessor (which earned barely over $157 million), and is certainly one of the sci-fi genre's most exciting films. The High Definition transfer for the Blu-ray package was done pristinely and gets viewers even closer to Singer's brilliant vision.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Get into The Fog and You'll Never Want to Come Out!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best of its genre.  The atmospheric direction and musical score are truly outstanding.  Carpenter works from a literate script and is supported by terrific actors.  Everyone involved in this film contributes their best work and it shows.  This film failed to find an audience when it was first released, but developed a cult following when it was released on VHS/DVD and its fanbase continues to grow and with good reason.  It's an outstanding film but it was released at a time when slasher films were ruling the box-office.  I just recently let my children see The Fog (they are 10 and 14) and it is not only among their favorite thrillers, but also their favorite films.  Like their dad, they love a good horror story and not a senseless slasher gorefest where teenagers line up to be killed after having sex and doing drugs.  There is a good reason why those redundant flicks lost their audience; they forgot they were suppose to scare us and not just jolt us with violent images.<br /><br />John Carpenter has done both slasher films, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305546789">Halloween</a> which was better than most flicks during its time, but also thoughtful, literate, well-paced, suspenseful, films that linger in your mind long after the experience of watching them is over.  Consider his other notable films like his remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CHK1S">The Thing</a> starring the ever reliable Kurt Russell and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767812166">Starman</a> where Jeff Bridges gave us a well-deserved oscar-nominated performance.  The only issue I have with Carpenter is that he is terribly inconsistent and at one moment you gives you his best, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWUI">Music of the Heart</a> and the next moment he gives you a half-hearted effort at best as with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOX0F">They Live</a>.  When he's "on", awesome, and when he's off, he's comatose.</p></body></html>

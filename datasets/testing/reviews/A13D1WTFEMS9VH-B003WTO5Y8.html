I did not find it to be a great movie. Indeed, I found much of it to be laughable. Now, perhaps this is because it has been parodied so much, I dunno. When the psycho killer said, "It puts the lotion on its skin", all I could think of was the parody scene from '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FP2OPO">Joe Dirt</a>'. Also, the part of the story about the vain, media-seeking doctor who 'treated' Lecter in the specially-constructed cell where he was kept was pretty far-fetched. Nor was Lecter's escape believable.<br /><br />All in all, a watchable movie, but one that, IMHO, is failing the test of time.</p></body></html>

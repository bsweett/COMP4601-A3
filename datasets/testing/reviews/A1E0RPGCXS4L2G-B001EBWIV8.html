The fight scenes were better and the special effects and stunt work were outstanding, even surpassing those of the first movie.  Of course, once again, this is a movie that you must really pay attention too.  I found myself lost at times, with holes in plot that I couldn't quite figure out.  Hopefully the third installment will fill these holes in.  Although not really my normal type of movie I found myself enjoying this one.  Although it would pay to see the first one before watching this one I think if you take it at face value you might not be any more lost that I was if you didn't see the first one.<p>The concept that the movies are based on is deep for me to think about.  The fact that life could be an actual computer program.  That we could be nothing more than programmed entities.  These deep thoughts that you could bounce around again and again are intriguing.  <p>Bottom line, in my opinion, enjoyable but not outstanding.</p></body></html>

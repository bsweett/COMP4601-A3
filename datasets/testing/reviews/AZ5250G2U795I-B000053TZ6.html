<meta name="summary" content="Can't argue with perfection."></head><body><p>This Fictional Account of the life of Charles Foster Cain (Really William Randolph Hearst...but I digress) is atop every critics list for a very good reason...It was duely earned!<p>This film is nothing short of a masterpiece in terms of casting (Ruth Warrick brings a powerful edge in the most subtle performance you will ever see!), lighting, camerawork, writing...you name it and it's got an element of filmmaking that is the benchmark of greatness.  <p>What's even more astounding is realizing that Welles was 25 when he made this!  How someone could convey so many tacit aspects of a larger than life character and keep him real without making him a cartoonish buffoon is an amazing feat when you think of the life experience you need to live for the kind of perspective necessary to avoid a very easy pitfall such as that.<p>This DVD should be a staple to any self-respecting DVD collector...it can't possible disappoint you.</p></body></html>

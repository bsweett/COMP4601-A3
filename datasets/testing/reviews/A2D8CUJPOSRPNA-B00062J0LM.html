<meta name="summary" content="Better-Than-Average Reworking Of A Classic"></head><body><p>Hollywood remakes or reworkings, especially if the originals are considered masterpieces, are very hard (if not downright impossible) to equal, let alone top.  Such is true with Jonathan Demme's 2004 remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 masterpiece THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  But while it can't really match the impact of the '62 original, it still scores in its own way.<br /><br />This time instead of the Cold War, the setting is in the aftermath of the first Persian Gulf War.  Denzel Washington is Captain Bennett Marco (the role played by Frank Sinatra in 1962), who suspects that the man who saved him durng an ambush in the Iraqi desert in 1991 may have undergone brainwashing.  That man is Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber, in the role first played by Laurence Harvey), who is now a potential candidate for vice-president of the United States, all the while being fiercely manipulated by his calculating, cold-blooded mother (Meryl Streep, doing Angela Lansbury's role).  The villains in this film are not the Manchurian Chinese of the '62 original but a big-time corporation called Manchurian Global, who have implanted Harvey (and Washington, for that matter) with electronic devices that can force the subject to do the company's bidding...even if that means making one of them commit a political assassination to put a corporate lackey in the Oval Office.<br /><br />Having three big pairs of shoes to fill, Washington, Harvey, and Streep do very fine work all the same, with some slight differences.  Demme indulges in many face-on shots (a stylistic trademark of his reminiscent of what he did on PHILADELPHIA and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), which is a bit irritating after a while, but otherwise his direction of the film is quite good, and he gets fine performances from his three leads, as well as Jon Voight in his role as a senator vying for the spot Havey wants and whom Streep hasn't the time of day for.  Veteran character actor Charles Napier and Demme's low-budget director/producer mentor Roger Corman also have cameos here.<br /><br />Although the climax is a bit disappointing in comparison to the disturbing aura of the 1962 original, the 2004 version of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a smart and cunning political thriller all its own, well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

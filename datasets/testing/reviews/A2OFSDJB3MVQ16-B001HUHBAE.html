<meta name="summary" content="Fincher's masterpiece of terror"></head><body><p>I'm not sure if I submitted a review of this but I have seen this absorbing David Fincher film twice, once in the theater and again in HD DVD--and it is awesome.  Like the numerous details that Fincher incorporates in the film to keep on your toes, the HD DVD version boast almost 3-D like realism and I'm sure the Blu-Ray version is the same except that it does cost considerably more than $8!!  Don't be put off by the length of this film, you surely will not be bored and there are several frightful moments in this docu-drama that will surely make you jump. Compared to the trashy slasher movies that are coming out of Hollywood, this film is a true original in its own low-keyed way--it grips you and won't let go.  I feel this film even more than "Seven" establishes Fincher as the best young director out there since Scorsese!!</p></body></html>

The story develops nicly, most hardcore Romero's fans like myself already know the plot but it did play out well.  The violent scenes are dont well, the acting was great, the scenery is great which I belive always plays a great role in developing atmosphere in these types of films.  Overall I liked this film alot, but as always it could have been alot better if they had gotten the army more involved like in the origional.  Great flick overall in it's own right.</p></body></html>

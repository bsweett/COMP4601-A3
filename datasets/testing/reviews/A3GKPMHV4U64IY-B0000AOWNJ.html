<meta name="summary" content="Nice Attempt"></head><body><p>This is an American version of a Japanese film based upon a comic.  Unlike The Grudge, which was directed by the same director as the Japanese version, this is a very different story from the Japanese (although there is a quick reference to the Japanese version).<br /><br />There is a rumor of a videotape that can kill people.  If you watch it you will get a phone call and be told you will die in seven days.  When a reporter's niece dies the reporter starts to look into the story.  First she finds out her niece had a secret boyfriend.  Then she finds out the boyfriend died at the same moment as the niece.  There is definitely something strange going on.  As the reporter digs through the story she discovers others died at the same time.  Then she learns about, and finds, the videotape.  She watches it before believing it.<br /><br />But soon the reporter does believe, but not before showing it to her ex.  She starts to become frantic with trying to find a way to break the curse and that means learning more about it.  But when her son watches the videotape she really begins to panic.  Now she not only has to solve the mystery for herself, but for her son.  Her son seems to have some connection to the video and its images and it somehow revolves around a young girl.  It becomes a race against time and the reporter finds a way she thinks will stop the curse.  Will she succeed?  Will she save the ones she loves?  Watch and find out.<br /><br />The videotape in Ringu makes more sense to me than the one here but the story has been rewritten in such a way as to make it work.  Here we have a film that kept the core of the original (the videotape, the ring, and the force behind the curse) and recrafted it into more than just an adaptation.  I found this film to be far better than I had thought it would be.  A pretty good and creepy film.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

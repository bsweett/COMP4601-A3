<meta name="summary" content="Eminem's surprising performance carries the film"></head><body><p>Once upon a time there was a young man named Jimmy. His friends called him B Rabbit. He was white and lived in a trailer on 8 Mile in Detroit, the line that seperates white from black neighborhoods, with his mother. He had a little sister that he loved and cared for like the dad he never knew. He had a hard labor job in a factory. He was sick of his life. He wanted to become a rapper. His break into the rap world could happen if he wins rap battles at a local club where he is seen as a failure. His life depends on that one shot. Will he take it?<br /><br />That sums up the story of 8 Mile, a surprisingly engaging flick directed by Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys) and starring rap sensation Eminem as Jimmy in his first big budget motion picture. The supporting cast includes Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as Jimmy's helpless mother, Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's friend and coordinator of the rap battles at the club, and Brittany Murphy as Jimmy's love interest and local flirt.<br /><br />What struck me the most about 8 Mile is Eminem's performance. Usually, hip-hop and rap artists can't act if their lives depended on it, but Mr. Mathers surprises the audience with a virtual emotion, humor, and subtleness that carries the film well into the climactic scene at the end where Jimmy goes against the odds to prove to himself, his friends, family, and the world that he's not just another trailer dweller from around the corner.<br /><br />The movie features the Academy Award winning song Lose Yourself, co-written and sung by Eminem himself.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

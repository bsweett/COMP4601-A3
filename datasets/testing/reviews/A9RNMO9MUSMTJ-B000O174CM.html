<meta name="summary" content="Eddie Murphy should have gotten a oscar.........."></head><body><p>Have you ever see Eddie Murphy act like that...wow, the man of many faces can also sing and does a great job with his character...but there is more here than just Eddie, we have the Dreamgirls who will enchant you with the several songs they present. The production and direction of this film is slick and things dont get boring too long. It is a musical, and they do sing a lot, so it helps to like music/musicals to really enjoy this film. Hope there are more musical films in the making....<br />Good for multiple viewings....<br />Oh before i forget....im giving a Virtual Oscar to Eddie Murphy.</p></body></html>

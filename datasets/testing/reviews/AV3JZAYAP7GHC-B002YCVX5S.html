<meta name="summary" content="The only atrocity committed was this film."></head><body><p>Long, boring, pointless. For a film about this crazy commando unit that goes Nazi hunting, there sure was very little of that going on. Just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. About nothing, and mostly from characters who weren't even "The Basterds". I think Brad Pitt and his merry band have a total of 30 minutes screen time in what is an insufferably long film. I should have guessed from the very first scene at the French farmhouse that this was going to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.<br /><br />If you must, out of curiosity or masochism or whatever, see this film for yourself, I highly suggest renting it first.<br /><br />I'm so over Tarantino. He's like the magazine collage maker of film. Just a bunch of stuff done by someone else pasted all over the place.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A sci-fi classic"></head><body><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EMO">Predator</a> is a true sci-fi classic. Like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)</a>, a powerful alien creature slaughters humans like cattle.<br /><br />What makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EMO">Predator</a> so great - and what more recent copycats lack - is a great cast of characters and dramatic scenes. Far from just being cannon fodder, you actually start to like Dillon and Blane and the rest. I'll never forget the scene when Dillon becomes so nervous he breaks his razor while shaving - what a great way to add tension to the scene. Of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job of being both tough and in control.<br /><br />Remarkably, for a film over 23 years old, the special effects don't seem dated at all. That's another great thing about the way the movie was made - rather than stuffing it with computer-generated graphics, the filmmakers used the technology they had in creative ways to accomplish what they needed. The result is more subtle and interesting, including not knowing what the Predator looks like until the end rather than shooting dozens of closeup shots of CG Predators..<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a high quality blu-ray version out yet, but the regular DVD is just fine.<br /><br />Interesting sidenote: two of the actors in this film, Schwarzenegger and Jesse Venture, later become governors. That could only happen with a quality movie!</p></body></html>

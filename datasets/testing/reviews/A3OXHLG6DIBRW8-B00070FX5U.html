<meta name="summary" content="Fun Action Movie - Recommended"></head><body><p>"Total Recall" is an enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick that delivers a lot of excitement and follows a fairly good plot. We wanted to see this before going to the remake (2012) so bought it through Amazon "Instant Video".<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: the story is set in 2084 and follows Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker that dreams of visiting Mars. The future has some interesting technology, including the ability plant memories directly into a person's brain and the "Rekall" company specializes in implanting vacation and adventure experiences for those that can't afford the money or time to take real ones. Quaid decides that this is the only answer to deal with his rising mars obsession and things don't go quite as planned from there.<br /><br />The acting was decent for this type of movie and also stared Sharon Stone as Quaid's wife and Rachel Ticotin as the love interest. The special effects range from just plain bad to very good and the science is often just plain wrong or highly questionable in places, but this is an action movie and it all works for the most part.<br /><br />This was a fun movie that is very watchable.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

You know they did have talkies at that time and drama but up to that point it was all done with a stationary camera.<br /><br />So the old professor really had done it all when he came upon the series of movies which made him famous. This was preceded with the sexy, scary-as-hell "Rear Window" with Jimmy Stewart, who along with Grant might have been Hitchcock's other favorite leading man. While Stewart (very courageous man but that's another story) lacked Grant's debonaire good looks and savoir faire, he was (Stewart) ordinary looking and Grant on the other hand could play ordinary.<br /><br />Here in NBNW Grant as Roger Thornhill, just on the wagon, obedient to his Mom even though he's in his 40's, gets mistaken for a double agent by the ever sinister James Mason and we're off to the races. We see the old airports, Love Field and the old American Airlines Eagle as Roger and Eve Marie Saint and Mason and Martin Landau chase each other over the 1950 terrain of the USA.<br /><br />The remarkable thing about Hitchcock is his relentless presentation of the average guy caught in events way, way over his head. Brilliant movie. Brilliant cast. Brilliant Director, really, never to be replaced. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

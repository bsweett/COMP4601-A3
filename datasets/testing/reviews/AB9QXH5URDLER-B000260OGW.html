<meta name="summary" content="Formula Western - Better Than Most"></head><body><p>As an actor in westerns, Costner ranks up there with Clint Eastwood, slightly below the Duke, in my mind.  &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; forever earned him that title.  The acting in this film is great.  But when you boil it all down, it fits the genre of the Western so well that little is left to the imagination.  This is not a criticism.  This is not bad.  It only describes the film and predicts who will want to own it.<p>If you like westerns - add this film to your collection.<br />If you dislike westerns - skip this film.<p>If you don't care one way or the other about westerns, but do enjoy great films - rent this one.  It is certainly worth seeing, but don't run out and buy it.  It may just collect dust on your shelf.</p></body></html>

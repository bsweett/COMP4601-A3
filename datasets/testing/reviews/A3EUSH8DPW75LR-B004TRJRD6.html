<meta name="summary" content="Superb blu ray version of a classic film"></head><body><p>I love The Exorcist - always have.  I have purchased all the versions along the way - vhs, dvd, extended version.  But now that most films I purchase are blu rays I was thrilled at the release of The Exorcist on blu ray.  There is always a simple first question to be asked when an older film is released on blu ray.  Was it a quick hatchet job merely to make more money off the film or was it a lovingly done restoration taking advantage of the new technology of blu ray.  I can gladly 1000% say that this one is handled with loving care.  The film looks amazing.  Color and the black/white ration is amazing.  Close ups throughout will have you awestruck.  It honestly is like viewing the film for the first time.  And they so impressively left the grainy parts intact.  This is a film over 30 years old and they could have easily erased all signs of age.  But some of the graininess in dark or night footage is necessary to the telling of the story and they left it as it should be.  Audio is superb and your home theater system will have a field day with the dramatic audio here.  Dialogue is also pefectly presented and not off from the musical backdrop or extrememe sound of the violent scenes.<br /><br />Now to the effects.  Remember that this film is decades old and special effects have grown leaps and bounds.  Here we get all of the scenes with Reagan totally cleaned up and let me tell you none of the frightening aspect is gone.  The only thing I noticed was how the blood was obviously red paint.  Otherwise this film is in no way dated and the blu ray version in fact raises it to another level.  I was amazed at how my perceptioon of the film changed due to this amazing version.  I think it is a huge gift that both the original theatrical version and the later extended director's cut are presented here in blu ray glory.  I prefer the theatrical version so that is the version I am speaking of.  I think that The Exorcist often gets misconstrued being described as a pure horror film.  It is so much more than this.  It is true that film makers have been trying to duplicate the effect of this film ever since.  From Scream, Halloween and Friday the 13 directors are trying to reach the same effect.  But by doing this they are missing the whole point.<br /><br />Viewing the film this time was the first time I saw how obviously it is a film of good versus evil and each viewer will have a different perception.  The Catholic Church plays a huge part and obviously represents the good and it works so well.  The viewer must see the Church as a religious presence and the nurturing it represented before all the tragic issues that would later arise within the church.  The priests here are good men, some troubled but all wanting to do their best.  Regan is perfectly displayed as an innocent without rubbing it in the viewers face.  From the beginning scene it is obvious that evil is being shown and as it wraps itself inside Regan it is terrifying.  The special effects still work for they are used to add to the story and meaning of the film.  They are not meant to be gratuituous.  In a world with such trouble this films clearly shows that there is good and evil.  The viewer is left with much to think about after viewing this superb blu ray version.<br /><br />I know people have double and triple dipped on The Exorcist but I cannot praise the blu ray release highly enough.  And it is handsomely presented in a hardback booklet with 38 pages of history on the film inside.  And there are special effects galore.  There is a new 3 part documentary on the film's production and legacy plus a feature length 1998 documentary on the making of the film with so much more.  The Exorcist is indeed a horror film but it is so much more.  It is one of the best movies made of any genre and deserves to be in any film collectors library.  And this blu ray version does immense justice to a classic.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Looks like it must have been fun to make this movie"></head><body><p>In one sense it is a remake with some improvements on the original. In another sense it is an excuse for one of today's brightest directors to assemble an A-list cast and have a great time. The movie is funny and smart, and Soderbergh was the perfect choice to direct this film. If you haven't seen many of his films, check out "Out Of Sight" (with George Clooney and a pre- wanna-be diva Jennifer "J-Lo" Lopez) and "Erin Brockovich" with that Julia somebody-or-other. Soderbergh's movies are so good that you want to become an actor just to work with him. Watching "Oceans 11" its easy to see why so many big-name actors jump at the chance to work on his projects.  Watch for the cast credits, specifically "... and introducing Julia Roberts".  This review refers to the Theatrical release of the movie - I haven't seen the DVD extras yet.</p></body></html>

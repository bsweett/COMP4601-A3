Miller and Kristen Wiig<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: William Davies, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders; based on the novel by Cressida Cowell<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders<br /><br />Rated: PG<br />Genre: Animation / Fantasy<br />Release Date: 26 March 2010<br />Review Date: 27 May 2010<br /><br />It's amazing how far animation has come; literally milestones from where it originated. It allows us to go on adventures no real life characters or actual movie sets could take us to. There are virtually no limitations in its magical world and How to Train Your Dragon dabbles in this splendid availability relentlessly.<br /><br />There's a reason movies like this and Avatar and Alice in Wonderland are raking in all the profits of consumers; they are the most fun to see in theaters. While I still remain a loyal patron to an abundance of movie stars, the days of an actor's name alone, filling seats are long gone for the majority of moviegoers. They want to be dazzled visually more than anything; thus the recent big to-do over 3-D and IMAX presentations. Bigger, brighter, and louder has now become better.<br /><br />The animation style is something we haven't seen very much of. The characters are all generated to look slightly less perfect than we know they could. Big eyes, obscure heads and hairdos, and their personalities are all modernized while the film has them placed back in the Viking era.<br /><br />Our hero is a boy named Hiccup and is ideally voiced by Jay Baruchel. Hiccups Dad is a massive burly Viking played by Gerard Butler and Hiccup may never live up to his manly expectations. His dad slays dragons and expects the same from him, and Hiccup just doesn't have the ambition to do this.<br /><br />That is lessened even more, when he befriends a dragon in the forest. The two meet when no one is around and soon begin meeting in secret on a regularly basis. Of course the dragon has a wounded wing, and Hiccup tends to it and earns the beast's trust.<br /><br />But what else would you have happen between a boy and a dragon? The film does not disappoint in making their connection enduring and fun-filled as the two take to the skies and bring us along for the ride. If there was ever a film worth paying an extra five bucks to see in 3-D, it's this one.</p></body></html>

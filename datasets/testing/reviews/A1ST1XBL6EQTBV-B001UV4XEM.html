(-: This movie is funny on so many levels...<br />your childish silly side, your more urbane adult side...it hits every funny bone!<br />I'm not giving anything away as not to spoil it for you, but trust me when I tell you...<br />this is an instant classic which will add years of levity to your DVD collection!<br />I have this on pre-order now and can't wait to recieve it and pop it into my DVD player!<br />Kids (teens) and adults will love this one!</p></body></html>

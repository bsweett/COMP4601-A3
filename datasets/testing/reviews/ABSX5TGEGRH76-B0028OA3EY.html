<meta name="summary" content="Superman's Return Isn't As Super As One Might Expect"></head><body><p>Two things to start off: First, I think this film deserves three and a half stars as opposed to 3, but Amazon doesn't allow half-star ratings, and I feel that it is closer to a three than a four.  Second, this is the only Superman movie that I have seen the complete film the whole way through.  I have seen the beginning and ending of Superman II as well as a scene from the original Superman, but that is it.<br /><br />Anyway, Superman Returns serves as a sequel to the first two Superman films, effectively erasing the canonicity of the third and fourth films (which is probably a good thing).  After astronomers claimed that they found the location of Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) felt that he needed to see the remains of his home for himself and left Earth for 5 years.  In that time, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from jail, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has found a new lover, won a Pulitzer for an article called "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman", and even had a son.<br /><br />Upon his return to Earth, Superman finds that he has been missed by the public as well as by Lois, despite what she has said.  Immediately he is off saving people again, while his alter ego Clark Kent gets his job back at the Daily Planet.  He is upset that Lois is now engaged to Richard White (James Mardsen), the nephew of the Planet's editor Perry White (Frank Langella), but he that pales in comparison to the revelation that Lois is now a mother.  The kid, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), is one of the film's low points, as his point in the plot is only to cause Clark angst and then (mild spoiler warning) help Lois out of some trouble.<br /><br />Luthor's overall scheme once again has to do with real estate, but it doesn't seem as maniacal as the one he used in the first film (despite not seeing it, I know what his plan was).  It's true that he would once again cause numerous deaths and would amass a lot of power, I just couldn't buy into it.<br /><br />Overall, the movie had some very strong points and some very weak points.  Some of the strong points included the effects as well as some of the scenes of Superman's exploits that didn't have to do with Luthor's plot.  However, some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy ("I forgot how warm you are!"), Routh lacks the charisma to effectively portray Superman, Bosworth doesn't appear to have any chemistry with any of the men in her life (that includes Supes, Richard, and Jason), and, as earlier stated, the threat just doesn't seem to be as menacing as Luthor makes it out to be.  Furthermore, I found a few inconsistencies towards the end that have to do with Superman's reaction to kryptonite, but I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say what they are.<br /><br />Maybe I just set myself up too much for this film.  I am a fan of Bryan Singer's work, and not just his work on his other superhero films.  While his two X-Men films are good (X2 is superb in my opinion), The Usual Suspects (also starring Kevin Spacey) is cinematic bliss, and House, which he executive produces, is a great medical drama.  Yet I was underwhelmed by this film, and I feel part of the reason is that Singer tried so hard to call back to the previous Superman films that he didn't infuse enough his his own vision into this one.<br /><br />It's too bad; this was shaping up to be the must-see film of the summer, but I (along with a sizable number of critics) left the theater feeling that that title will now go to the Pirates of the Caribbean sequel.</p></body></html>

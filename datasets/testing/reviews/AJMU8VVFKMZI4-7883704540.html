I think I was doing good until climax of the film and there is literally hundreds or thousands of rats cooking and what not.  At that point, I couldn't stop shaking my head.  But as far as Remy and his non-cooking companion, I found the duo charming.  Pixar is the king of what they do and for that I will always be a returning viewer.</p></body></html>

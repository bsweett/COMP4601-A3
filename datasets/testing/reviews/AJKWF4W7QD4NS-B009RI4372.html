First off you can tell the film is low budget, but that didn't stop Raimi from crafting a wild, shocking, well rounded movie that created an entire cult legacy.  In case you don't know the story by now, five college students go on vacation at an abandoned cabin, only to find the Necronomicon and inadvertantly release some very evil spirits that takes over each person one by one until only our reluctant hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left.  What follows is a wildly entertaining horror thrillride that pulls out as many stops as Raimi can handle behind the helm with the claustrophobic, eerie atmosphere of the cabin and the surrounding, living forest, and some greatly disorienting and dizzying camera angles.  The makeup effects team used the small budget as best they could to create some great blood and gore effects (I still can't get the image of one of the girls knawing her hand off), and Bruce Campbell is equally great in his defining role, although he would not be the slapstick ridden hapless hero of the later films Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.  All in all, if you want to watch a real horror movie thats budget didn't strap its' imagination, then there isn't a better time then now to get this new special edition of Evil Dead.  Plus, the Book of the Dead casing is fantasticly designed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SIMPLY WONDERFUL!"></head><body><p>An OUTSTANDING film, Forrest Gump, follows the life of a young boy from Alabama as he grows up and through him sheds light not only on his life, but on modern American history as well.<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, innocence, friendship, and inner strength.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention quite a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Forrest Gump is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!</p></body></html>

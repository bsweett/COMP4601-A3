Set against the barren, wind-swept desert of the west Texas plains, the Coen brothers latest film is an unflinching portrait of men destroying each other for petty gain and the decay of an American society that played a major part in molding their moral outlook.  Tommy Lee Jones, doing some of the most stupendous and subtle work of his career, acts as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell the world-weary narrator to the downward spiral of humanity.  Javier Bardem, to whom an oscar will be most assuredly be gift-wrapped, shuts down any hint of humanity to play Anton Chigurgh, a ghoulish, blood-chilling, drug-running enforcer who races across Texas to hunt down Lleywen Moss (Josh Brolin, so into character he almost becomes transparent), the unlucky cowboy who happened to take the wrong drug money at the wrong time.  The chase between Moss and Chigurgh is exciting enough, what with the Coen brothers pulling out all the stops to let the blood flow and bullets fly.  Try to remember to breathe when the two shoot it out in motel and around the surrounding township.  But it's the brothers sharply written script that digs in its hooks to extrapolate the plight of Moss and Chigurgh to the world at large, how their violent battles may just be systemic of bigger, deeper and more corrosive trends in American society.  "No Country for Old Men" is a tough film to watch, and not because of the ample, shocking violence; it's tough to watch because of what the violence means.  It's a triumph for the brothers Coen and one of the best films of the year.</p></body></html>

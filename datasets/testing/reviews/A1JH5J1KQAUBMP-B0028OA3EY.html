<meta name="summary" content="The Man of Steel is back"></head><body><p>After a five-year absence from Earth to explore the ruins of Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth and tries to pick up his life where he left off.  Although Clark Kent's job at the Daily Planet is waiting for him, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is not.  Now a mother, she is also in a committed relationship.  To make matters worse, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and uses its advanced technology to launch his most deadly scheme yet.<br /><br />Although the film runs too long, I confess I enjoyed every minute of it.  Obviously, 25 years of advances in special effects techniques allow for far more spectacular sequences than the Richard Donner films to which this is an affectionate sequel, and director Bryan Singer takes advantage of them to present some great Superman moments.  His reintroduction to the world by saving a plummeting airplane is a highlight.  Routh and Bosworth aren't able to match the chemistry of Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, but they do a good job and I'm looking forward to seeing them in the next Superman adventure.  Spacey presents Luthor's cruel streak more effectively than Gene Hackman did.</p></body></html>

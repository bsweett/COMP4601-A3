This centers mainly around a family and how they react to the outbreak getting inside their safe and protected community.  There are some very tough to watch scenes in this early on, but there was a lot of spirit to get the main characters safe.  There is one scene that was so horrifying claustrophobia wise and the music blaring (that famous music from the first one) that will make your heart pound from fear.  I loved the conflict the soldiers had also, when they were forced to gun everything down.  The actor that played Doyle was great at really making you feel for him, he was so conflicted.  I didn't think I'd like this, but they really surprised me.</p></body></html>

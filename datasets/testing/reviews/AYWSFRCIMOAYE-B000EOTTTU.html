Half of the movie is about the relationship between Pocahontas and Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell). The trouble is I do not sense any love between them at all. Even though the director took a lot of time to depict the  chemistry between them. It's more like reading the biography of Pocahontas.<br /><br />It's worth renting not buying.<br /><br />Ghost is still the only title on my list of Best Love Story movies of all time.<br />.</p></body></html>

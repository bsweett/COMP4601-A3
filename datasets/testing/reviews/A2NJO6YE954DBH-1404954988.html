I kept thinking how lucky Cage's character was to be married to her and hoped for David Ducovny's sake that Leoni was not really acting.  I bring up that 2000 film as a reference point because Leoni plays the wife of Adam Sandler in the 2004 film "Spanglish" and she is not just at the other end of the spousal spectrum she has gone around the bend.  Her Deborah Clasky is an awful person (if I did not know this the fact my wife said as much a half-dozen times during the movie would have been a clue).  She is an awful wife to her husband, an awful mother to her daughter, and an awful employer to her hired help.  What makes her so awful is that she is not abusive, so it is not a question of calling the cops and having her carted away to the betterment of her family.  She is not a malicious person and it is because her husband obviously loves her and that her daughter so desperately needs her that we want her to stop being an awful person.  The big question is whether there is anything there inside of her to build a decent human being.<br /><br />This might make "Spanglish" seems like a horror show, but it really is a romantic comedy.  The story is narrated by Christina (Aimee Garcia) a young girl who has written her college application to Princeton explaining why her mother is the most influential person in her life ("no contest").  We learn how Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) took young Christina from Mexico to Los Angeles and managed to work two jobs without ever having to learn English.  But as Christina (Shelbie Bruce) becomes a teenager, Flor has to find one job that will pay as much as too so she can see that her daughter is raised right.  That is how Flor ends up in the Clasky household.  John (Sandler) is a great chef whose restaurant is on the cusp of making it big while Deborah has been downsized out of a job into being a stay home mom where she has been reading way too many books on parenting.  She thinks her daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) should be a size 8 and the stars in her eyes are blinding her to the tears in her daughter's eyes.  To add insult to injury, Deb is captivated by Christina, who seems the perfect daughter she deserves.  Without any other thoughts in her pretty head, Deborah starts doing things she should not be doing.<br /><br />The Claskys have a son, Georgie (Ian Hyland), but his only real problem is that when he has nightmares his maternal grandmother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) teaches him another song she sang when she was a big jazz singer.  Otherwise grandma links to drink a lot of wine.  Meanwhile Deborah's self-absorption is going beyond being neurotic or merely having the type of mid-life crisis that sudden unemployment can provoke into a black hole that is threatening to suck in the rest of the characters.  The saving Grace is Flor, who might not understand the language but understands the emotional turmoil of the household she has entered.  However, just as she begins to but this fractured family back together Deborah insists on finding a new way of tearing it apart and making Flor and Christina part of the madness as well.  Compared to his crazy wife John is obviously going to find Flor attractive, and she is aware of the qualities he has that his wife is not so much ignoring as trying to beat out of him.<br /><br />Leoni is such a force of nature gone awry in this film that you have to stop and take notice that the others are turning in fine performances as well.  Sandler has not weaned himself of all of his comic elements but like "Fifty First Dates" this film proves that he can play a really nice guy, albeit with moments of manic insanity (several of his best moments are in the deleted scenes).  Paz Vega is a Spanish actress who signed up for the project without knowing English, which is perfect for the role, as is the fact that she manages to be both sexy and sweet, often at the same time (which is a neat trick).  She is the central character in "Spanglish," but since she is the eye of the hurricance while the Clasky marriage is imploding you can sometimes forget that fact.  Both of the young actresses hold their own with the grownups, with Bruce having a great scene where she mediates rather than just translate for her mother and John having a fight and Steele nailing the pain of a teenage daughter who is closer to her dad than she is to her mom at a time when she needs her mom the most.  Leachman actually refrains from stealing every scene she is in, but she does pick her moments and she becomes the key to her daughter's salvation, which is not a move I saw coming.</p></body></html>

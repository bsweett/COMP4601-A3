<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating, but bloody"></head><body><p>By now the gimmick of the brilliant, renegade investigator whose special insights into the nature of serial murder border on, if not actually cross into, the paranormal has become rather tiresome.  However, this type of character has apparently become an indispensible part of the serial killer genre (what does it say about us that such a genre exists?), and directors Allen and Albert Hughes have presented an interesting twist by making it necessary for Scotland Yard inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), hot on the trail of Jack the Ripper, to use opium in order to access his gift.  This adds to the overall dark and hopeless tone of this fine film, and ultimately makes Depp's character rather tragic.<p>This is a very stylish, atmospheric film that occurs almost entirely at night on foggy London streets.  I enjoyed the sad romantic subplot, although Heather Graham's Mary Kelly is too well-scrubbed to be a convincing Whitehall prostitute.  I also enjoyed the Freemason angle and way the Hughes brothers focus on the importance of class distinctions and how the wealthy fashion their own brand of justice.</p></body></html>

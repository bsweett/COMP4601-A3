<meta name="summary" content="When you get headbutted by the toad style, you fly all the way upto the stratosphere and back."></head><body><p>(1) This one is a martial arts parody film co-written, co-produced, directed by and starring Stephen Chow.<br /><br />(2) The plot centers around a poor Hong_kong semi-slum locality which defies surrendering to the opressive axe gang who are known for their looting and oppression.<br /><br />(3) The Land Lord and land lady of this locality are superior kung-fu fighters which we come to know later on in the film<br /><br />(4) Stephen Chow plays an axe-member wannabe. He wants to be part of the axe gang.<br /><br />(5) There are 3 mind blowing action sequences in the film<br /><br />(6) Setpiece 1: The axe gang come to intimidate and get the slum locality to bow down to them; Three of the dwellers in the locality happen to be super kung fu gurus; The three of them send the axe gang packing<br /><br />(7) Setpiece2: Axe gang sends the world's 2nd best assasin team; 2 guys who by playing notes on a stringy-madarin kind of intrument,can summon and create swishing swords, arrows, axes all from thin air from the vibration of the musical notes and these weapon are flung onto the the 3 saviors of the slum locality. The assasins kill all three of the saviors.<br /><br />(8) This brings the landlord and landlandy into the foray; The landlord can do superior kungfu and the landy apart from kung fu has a scream that shatters glass, stone, anything.<br /><br />(9) The landlord/landlady team team up against the No 1 killer of all. He had been locked up in a cell, but is freed by the axe gang to kill the landlord/landady team after the musical killer assasin team fails to kill LL/LL team. This killer is No 1 because apart from being a kung fu master as everyone in this movie obviously is, he has the speciality of being so fast as to even catch a bullet with his fingers.<br /><br />(10) Major setpiece 3: The LL/LL team fight their hearts out, and finally we get the stephen chow's matrix parody "the one" experience. There is  the famous paraody of the matrix reloaded sequence where Keannu fights 100's of agent miths. Here we have 100 of axe gang members against stephen Chow who has had a change of heart and has turned against the axe gang.<br /><br />(11) In this action setpiece we see the "crouching tiger, hidden dragon" physics defying fly-kicking spiderman gravity defying kungfu. We see the all new toad style, where the villain very much becomes a toad. We also see the farthest a human being travels (upto the stratosphere actually) when getting head butted via someone conversant with the toad style of kung fu. Incidentally Stephen chow goes so high up, he puts his feet on an eagle and becomes as light as the bird and floats around before zooming back in with friction burn like one of them spiralling down satellites before he just uses his palm of "the one" and makes a devastating handprint on the earth big enough to cover 5 men.<br /><br />A novel and insane comic caper with great special effects. A movie which makes fun of the kungfu genre and at the same time hieghtens this surreal kung fu experience.<br /><br />regards, VIkram</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elektrafying!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie with one of my friends. We'd both give it a nice, juicy 10 out of 10. It had terrific fight scenes, a cool plot, grand villains, and Elektra herself was so beautiful it's not even funny! There was quite a lot of humor in it, as well. One of the best. See it and you'll have done yourself the greatest favor this side of female movies!</p></body></html>

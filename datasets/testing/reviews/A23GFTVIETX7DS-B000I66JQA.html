<meta name="summary" content="I adored every minute of this film!"></head><body><p>After having read Michael Cunningham's novel, I could not imagine how a successful movie could be made from it.  With its three separate plots, I expected visual confusion and disjointedness.  Instead, I was stunned by how expertly everything was brought together.  The adaptation is both first-rate and insightful, excising the extraneous and focusing on the most crucial matters contained within the original novel.  "The Hours" instantly earned its place in my heart as one of my favorite movies.<p>The film begins and ends with the suicide of Virginia Woolf, a writer driven by madness and a passion for both life and death.  Director Daldry then jumps to the 1950's as pregnant Laura Brown wakes up to her oppressive suburban life, and then to the 1990's as Clarissa Vaughn jumps from bed to prepare for a party for her dying best friend, a poet striken with AIDS.  Just as quickly, the audience is taken back to Virginia Woolf as she, too, embarks on a new day, one which will result in her penning of the beginning of her famous novel MRS. DALLOWAY.  The beginning is probably the most confusing part of the film as Daldry establishes these three separate lives in three disparate times; however, once the first five minutes has passed, everything is strongly established and easily discerned.  The minimalist soundtrack composed by Philip Glass couldn't be more perfect for this story of variations on a theme; the music creates tension by crescendo, then retreats into its quiet repetition, leaving the audience gasping.  I'm not sure how many people in the theater realized how well the music manipulated their reactions.<p>Most of the action in this movie is psychological.  It is a film of close-ups, where a twitch or averting of the eyes tells volumes.  Because of this subtle nature, the acting must be brilliant and understated.  Fortunately, it is - and then some.  Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the tormented and brilliant Virginia Woolf is extraordinary; she IS Virginia Woolf.  Julianne Moore also turns in an expert performance, while Meryl Streep is, well, very Meryl Streep - perhaps too much so.  Claire Danes, in her brief appearance as Clarissa's daughter, illuminates and enlivens everything around her.  Allison Janney as Clarissa's lover Sally provides a competent and natural performance, although her role is more ornamentation than character.  So much has been said about the actresses in this film that one of the best performances is often overlooked:  Ed Harris as the dying poet, Richard. <p>If you hate art films or crave fast-moving plots, you'll be disappointed with the deeply psychological nature and thematic development of "The Hours." All others will be richly rewarded by this powerful, expertly constructed film about what it means to hold onto life and then let it go.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alien-Somehow Everything Came Together to Make a Great Film"></head><body><p>This double DVD box set is a must addition for any collector of science fiction films. The second DVD in the set describes how the plot was first conceived by a couple of unknown writers, developed, rewritten by competant studio writers and then skillfully crafted into a great work by Ridley Scott. Although the scenario which produced this film may have resulted from a favorable combination of random events, the excellent direction the movie received was no accident. Ultimately, everything came together to produce a really outstanding film.<br /><br />The documentary which describes the evolution of the alien saga is worth the price of the box set alone.  The original and relatively unknown writers were permitted to comment and contribute to the film production by director Ridley Scott.  The writers tale of this long arduous journey which culminates in the opening of the film gives insight to the satisfaction of witnessing the realization of an original screen vision.<br /><br />Based on Amazon's published statistics above Alien needs no further endorsement from me. I just wish to say "amen" to everything good that has been said and comment on my movie going experience and the effect it had on me and the audience in the year it came out.<br /><br />I went to see this film as a 30 year old man who was breast fed on horror and science fiction movies. I acquired a taste for horror by watching these movies since my very early years when my older brother "permitted" me stay up to watch late night TV. I, like so many others, became a die-hard fan of classic horror and sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From its suspenseful and well paced opening to its thrilling conclusion we in the audience knew we were watching something brilliant. The film immediately allowed us to suspend disbelief and become totally immersed in the plot. The credible and very elaborate sets, costumes, suspenseful music, and deliberately controlled pace all made for the sci-fi experience of a lifetime.<br /><br />The two surprising scenes of the "chestburster" and the beheading of the robot Ash had an effect on the audience made up of both younger and older people who were shocked into animated discussion. The audience continued their nervous discussions as the film progressed comparing ideas of where the film would go next while still trying to follow the story. When the movie ended the audience rose in unison to their feet cheering and clapping for the absent makers of the movie. We all realized that we had witnessed something very special.<br /><br />I did not realize until I tried to go to sleep that night that for the first time in perhaps 20 years I would have a difficult time. It took me an unusually long time to drop off, as I stirred under the blankets occasionally peeking around the dark room in dread of seeing Giger's Alien and the doomed crew of the NOSTROMO.<br /><br />As an aside, I really enjoyed the computer voice effects for MOTHER, who did appear to possess a personality as well as AI in the final action packed scenes</p></body></html>

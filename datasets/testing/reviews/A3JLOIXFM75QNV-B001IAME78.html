<meta name="summary" content="HULK...SMASH!!!! ..........or not"></head><body><p>Ang Lee's version was unwatchable so I was cautiously optimistic regarding this version. I've always liked Ed Norton and while the casting may be strange, I figured he would try something different and interesting with the role.<br /><br />I had a hard time trying to rate this film. I think without a doubt the first half of the film is the strongest, while the latter half was sort of ridiculous and over the top in a bad way. The plot is somewhat mangled, the characters range from uninteresting to downright annoying and the 'bad guy' Hulk was pretty stupid.<br /><br />Ed Norton brought some personality to the title role but even he couldn't save this film. He has a specific look that works so well in most of the films he does, but here, well, it was sometimes odd to see him in character. Liv Tyler did the best she could with her boring role. Her and Norton's character couldn't be more different and trying to picture them together in anyway just didn't work.<br /><br />The climax of the film, as I mentioned earlier is shockingly ridiculous. It is unintentionally funny and just loud and annoying. My 3 star rating is generous-it would be more like 2.5, but like I said, the first half of the film is respectable and had great potential. It's just too bad about the rest of it.</p></body></html>

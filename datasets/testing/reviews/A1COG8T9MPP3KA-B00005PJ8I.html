<meta name="summary" content="Something funny to point out"></head><body><p>When Tom Hanks cuts his hands while trying to start a fire, he screams and puts his hand up towards the camera as if to say "see I cut my hand just so you know what is going on", very cheesy moment.<br /><br />Other things that took away from the film are: how coincidental that one of the boxes was a ball. He uses this ball to explain key things in the plot since there is no other way to explain it. How convenient one of the boxes contained ice skates, he later used for cutting coconuts. Also the VHS tapes supplied rope for his raft.<br /><br />Other than this, a very entertaining film. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />p.s. why is that top reviewers have like 9 paragraphs explaining every detail of the film? DO we need 200 reviews that are identical?</p></body></html>

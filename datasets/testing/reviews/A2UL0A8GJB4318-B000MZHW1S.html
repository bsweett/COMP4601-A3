Just ask Danny Archer (Leonardo Dicaprio).  Even though Archer is a fictional fortune hunter dashing arcoss Sierra Leone to cash in on the chaotic diamond trade, his revelations to crusading journalist Manny bowen (Jennifer Connelly) of greed and capitolism run amok are startling and they help lend moral resonance to a film that is otherwise a thrilling two and a half hour chase through the African bush.<br /><br />Archer, an experienced oppurtunist, is desparate to escape Africa and he finds his shot when, imprisoned for diamond smuggling, he overhears fellow prisoner Solomon Vandy (Djimon Houson) being grilled by a wounded rebel general about the whereabouts of a large and rare pink diamond.  Archer breaks Vandy out of prison and the two (along with Connelly's Bowen) sprint around the countryside to find where Vandy stashed the diamond, a mutual argreement since Archer wants out of Africa and Vandy wants to reconnect with his vanished family.  Vandy, who is played with immense passion by Houson, is a fisherman who lost track of his family when his village was raided by rebel soldiers, including child soldiers brandishing AK-47's bought from the illicit diamond trade.  Vandy's wife and daughters escape to a refugee camp but his son is captured by rebel soldiers and indoctrinated into the army.  The brutal abuse and brainwashing of child soldiers and the violence inflicted on civilians by all warring factions is portrayed with unflinching and devastating realism by director Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), whose vision of total war in Africa is augmented greatly by cinematographer Eduardo Serra (Girl with a Pearl Earring) and editor Steven Rosenblum, a Zwick favorite.  The images of Vandy's son killing rebel prisoners blindfolded, shooting heroin and giving in to the serpentine manipulation of his demented commander is heartbreaking, all a consequence of the continuing war that large Diamond corporations and monopolies have a stake in continuing and Archer has a stake in exploiting.<br /><br />The film's themes and imagery haunt because of the superb acting from the trio of leads (Dicaprio, Connelly and Houson) that carry the entire film.  Dicaprio has the trickiest role of a rougish and amorous soldier of fortune willing to sell out anyone and anything to acheive his goals, and he tears into the role with a confidence and maturity that is worlds away from "Titanic" and even his early work with Martin Scorcese.  He's charismatic, cunning and lethal, and perhaps this constitutes the finest work he has ever done.  Connelly takes what would have been a throw-away part as a moralistic journalist and energizes it with undiluted moral anger and indignation, harboring no illusions to how hard exposing the story of blood diamonds and the beneficiaries will be.  Houson is pure power and passion as a father pushed to edge, who will trek through the hellish countryside of Sierra Leone to find his family.<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" is not an easy film to watch.  The violence is unrelenting and shattering and the amoral greed disheartening.  Even the most uplifting aspects of the film are haunted by the chance that something like Sierra Leone may very well happen again.  It is true that "Blood Diamond" is a dynamite chase film, and it is entertaining on that front, but it is the theme of global greed coldly manipulating nations and lives for profit and the imagery of savage total war and child soldiers that is impossible to shake.</p></body></html>

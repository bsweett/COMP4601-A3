Stephen Spielberg takes a dramatic look at the revenge that (could have?) taken place following the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. While "inspired by actual events," we don't know how much of what we are watching is true and how much is made up - a common problem with today's cinema, as well as today's news media. At the beginning of the film, in the optional intro by Spielberg, he says that certain facts (three to be exact) are indisputable. When a filmmaker or writer starts talking about "indisputable facts," watch out. Regardless of what Spielberg says in his intro, and regardless of the facts, MUNICH is about the vanity of revenge: how there is no end to it because it only spawns more revenge, and reeks havoc on the souls of those involved in it. No wonder God said, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay," and "Turn the other cheek."<br /><br />Eric Bana (Troy) is superb as Avner, who must learn these lessons the hard way. He gives up life with his wife and new baby to travel the world, tracking down the 11 men that he has been led to believe were responsible for the massacres in Munich. He has four others with him, none of which have had any experience as assassins. He has a neutral contact man who sells him leads and equipment, ammo, etc. Together the team rigs telephones, TV's, beds, etc. with bombs, in order to take out their victims. Eventually, the hunters become the hunted, so that Avner, on the brink of despair, ends up sleeping in his closet, afraid that someone may have rigged his own phone, his own TV, his own bed.<br /><br />At one point, Avner has a conversation with a Palestinian who, not realizing that Avner is Jewish, tells him that having a homeland is everything, and that if he understood that, he would have sympathies for the Palestinians rather than for the Israelis. Later, Avner's mother tells him how proud she is of him, because he has helped secure a place on earth for Israel. The irony is overwhelming. Avner himself has no home, no place on earth, because he's a man on the run.<br /><br />In another conversation, Robert protests against all the blood they're spilling for Israel, and tells him, "We're Jews, Avner. We're supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. That's Jewish. That's what I knew, that's what I was taught." God promised Israel a place in heaven if they would follow His Law. Yet, in this movie, they are selling their souls, their "righteousness," for a place on earth: more great irony. There are many spoken and unspoken truths in this film that warrant ferreting out.<br /><br />The imagery in MUNICH is powerful. Avner loves cooking and often finds himself standing in front of a kitchen store, dreaming of the kitchen he may one day have. His contact man has a "pappa" who wants to meet with him, so Avner allows himself to be blindfolded and taken somewhere in the Italian countryside. Although it starts out ominously, it turns out to be a kind of holiday, full of children and sunshine, family and cooking - a stark contrast to the rest of the film. It turns out that Pappa is also a gourmet cook, and together they prepare a meal and develop a type of relationship. Pappa tells him that he and Avner are very much alike, "tragic men, with butcher's hands but gentle souls." As Avner is leaving, Pappa tells him, "You could have been my son...but you're not. Remember that. We'll do business, but you aren't family." Avner realizes that Pappa could just as easily sell his information to the other side as to him, since he has no loyalties. That's when he understands how little his life is worth, and how it can only end badly if he continues with his "mission."<br /><br />There is some wonderful filmmaking in MUNICH. The cinematography is beautiful as well as gritty, John Williams score is powerful, and the script is taut. Across the board, the acting is superb, with Daniel Craig (Steve), Ciaran Hinds (Carl), Mathieu Kassovitz (Robert), Hanns Zischler (Hans) and Moritz Bleibtreu (Andreas) as standouts. Many of the images are disturbing, as this is very much an adult drama, with extreme violence as well as nudity - thus the R rating. It is not a feel good movie, but it is a think deep one.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

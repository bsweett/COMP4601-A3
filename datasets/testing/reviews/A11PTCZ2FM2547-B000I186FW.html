No vain variation can vex the verisimilitude of a vital venture to shake up a vapid populace--although opinions may vary.  Indeed, this film voices a vortex of vile violence surrounding vintage virtuality.<br /><br />Starring the vainglorious Hugo Weaving (a vigilante Elrond); and Natalie Portman, who needs to be more voluptuous.  Yet each scene is stolen by vulgar John Hurt, who proves to be a most violent, vitriolic villain.  Stephen Rea is just, kind of there, but I vigress, er digress.<br /><br />A vicissitude of voluminous vulgarity (yet often velvety), V FOR VENDETTA often approaches even venereal delight.  Which makes it, dear friends, quite valid.  And Guy Fawkes only vandalizes my vexation, yet what a virtuoso!  Oy vey, indeed.<br />--D. Mikels, Author (Vexed), The Reckoning</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you haven't been Ben Stiller-ed to death in 2004..."></head><body><p>Then this is a must see!  Particularly for anyone who grew up watching the series, owned the hot wheel's Torino, or bought 'Don't Give up on us Baby,' as a 45!<br /><br />Stiller and Owen Wilson play Starsky and Hutch, two opposite-end types partnered together to police crime.  In what is one of the most brilliant casting decisions ever, Their pimp-informant Huggy Bear is played by Snoop Dogg...which is really just such effective casting it's hard to come up with new adjectives to say how clever it is.  Stiller and Wilson effectively master their characters quirks (Where in the WORLD did the costumer's ever find that hideous Starsky cardigan!?!?), and the story, while not the stuff of brain surgery, is light and entertaining.  It's a well done 70's TV to screen in much the same way Charlies Angles 1 was:  It manages to stay true to the show, while still satirizing it's material.<br /><br />Most brilliant spot is Starsky and Hutch bring home their dates, and Hutch does his 'thang.'  For those who remember the 70's and lived it...please don't drink during this segment, becaue you 1.) will choke on your soda or 2.) lose your soda as you do the classic spit-take before rolling in laughter.</p></body></html>

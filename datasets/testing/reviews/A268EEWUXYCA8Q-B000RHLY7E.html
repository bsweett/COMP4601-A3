<meta name="summary" content="Did I see the same movie?"></head><body><p>I waited to see the House of 1000 Corpses until it came out on HBO.  It was reviewed so horribly that I didn't even want to waste my money on it.  In the end, I was glad because I really didn't care for it too much.  So, when Devil's Rejects was announced, I rolled my eyes and thought nothing of it.  Until the decent reviews came in.  At that moment, I thought, well maybe Zombie got his act together and maybe the new one will be decent.  I should have waited for HBO again.<br /><br />Really, I am the prime demographic for this movie.  I'm in the low 20s, I'm a guy and I love horror films.  I enjoyed the 70s horror gore flicks, the 80s stalkers and the more adult horror films of today (like Haute Tension and Saw are two that come readily to mind).  The movies that are truly horror (because there are major differences between scary movies and horror movies).  And, to Zombie's credit, The Devil's Rejects feels at times an homage to the 1970s gore flicks like TCM.  Unfortunately, it's like he took the worst parts of those films and ignored the best.<br /><br />At the heart, Rejects is a road trip movie about a family of serial killers.  And the movie is mostly told from their point of view, with a couple of scenes as viewed by the obsessive detective.  I'm not sure who is supposed to be the protagonists of the movie and I'm sure that that is the point of the movie.  All of these characters become or are at the beginning all morally ambiguous or the antithesis of morality that I can't even begin to relate to them.  So, when the killing starts, I'm so distanced from the movie that I don't even care.  It's not suspenseful, it's not scary, it's just violence in the name of violence.<br /><br />And it is here that I think Rob Zombie missed the point.  The reason the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre was so effective in its horror was that we had a character we could sympathize with.  Sally Hardesty was a sympathetic character so that when she was trapped at the hands of the cannibalistic family, when she's being chased by Leatherface and when her friends are all murdered in horrific ways, we feel the horror.  When the Firefly family is tortured in the Rejects, I don't feel sympathy for them, I don't feel anything.  It's just violence.  And it's deserved.<br /><br />And, for a horror film, it was incredibly boring.  With only a few sequences that were horrifying or intense (the aftermath at the hotel involving the maid for instance) that were interesting, we are given boring and pointless dialogue, driving sequences and sequences of horrible acting.  The whole movie felt drawn out that I was actually looking at my watch, waiting for it to be over.<br /><br />The only really fun parts of the movie involved Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding.  He was my favorite character in House of 1000 Corpses and he is the only shining light here.  His grin filled with rotting teeth, his scary clown routine and his home life all provided the only source of entertainment in the Rejects.<br /><br />Truthfully, I didn't have the highest hopes for this movie.  I was willing to give it a chance based on some of the reviews I've read, and I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised.  But, even with my low hopes I was still disapointed.  It lacked some of the good things from 70s horror and took all of the bad.  Instead of feeling like an homage to that genre and style of horror, it became a mess of a movie.  In the end, I didn't care and I wasn't horrified by much of anything (hotel scene is about it) because for the most part, they all deserved it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="And it burns burns burns"></head><body><p>This Oscar winning movie is every bit as good as you may have heard. There isn't single wasted frame, and just about every performance is spot-on. But the movie belongs to its two leads. Joaquin Phoenix burns darkly as the young Johnny Cash. His immersion into the role of the troubled "Man In Black" matches that of Oscar Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman's in "Capote." Even more fascinating is how Phoenix took the time to learn Cash's vocal mannerisms and record the songs for the movie. While Phoenix lacks Cash's low register gruffness, he still convinces as a singer. It really helps in the concert sequences, especially at the climactic legendary Folsom Prison performance.<br /><br />The same can be said for Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, who continues to grow as an actress. As June Carter, she manages to blend warmth, spunk and humility as she lives a life that runs parallel to Cash's, even as Cash begins to fall victim to his demons. She comes to terms with Cash's ongoing advances, even as she keeps her distance from his drug addiction. And like Phoenix, she sang her parts for the soundtrack. The duet of "Jackson" will stop your clock...you'll pause to wonder if they are really singing or if they are miming to the original.<br /><br />The other singers in the cast are solid in their performances, but particular credit belongs to Waylon Malloy Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis, who plays The Killer as a mischief making imp with just a brief glimpse at his dark side. As Executive Music Producer, T-Bone Burnette does his usual remarkable job at keeping the soundtrack rootsy and authentic. There's great original songs included with Phoenix and Withersppoon's tracks, making sure that "Walk The Line" never loses that air of honesty. It cuts off when June agrees to marry Johnny in front of a live audience (essentially losing 35 years of story), but the one thing I can say to "Walk The Line's" benefit is that I didn't feel cheated. You'll come away from "Walk The Line" with a firm understanding of just why June and Johnny's marriage endured.</p></body></html>

This is a strange and very well made film that is touching, funny, sad and twisted.  One of those rare gems that did not fall victim to a &quot;Hollywood&quot; formula.  I don't know why it took me so long to finally watch this, but I'm glad that on a day when I had nothing to do that I decided to pop this into the DVD player.<p>Based on the underground comic book by Daniel Clowes, the story focuses on two characters who have just graduated from high school, Enid and Rebecca.  They love to snoop around in other people's lives and find ways to humiliate them for their own amusement.  When they play a practical joke on an isolating loner, Seymour, Enid can't help to feel a little guilty--which is something she never feels in similar situations.  She ends up forming a strange and open relationship with him after that, and that's when things become complicated for Enid.  While Rebecca has more of a focus on where to go next after finishing high school, Enid doesn't have a clue about her future.  She feels trapped in a dead end town that offers no sanctuary for her.  All of this makes way for a drama/comedy that sticks out from other films.<p>I had been told many times that this was a movie that I had to see, and now I finally understand why.  It was completely different from what I thought the movie would end up being.  It's funny and sad at the same time, which is a very difficult task to accomplish without it ending up being corny.  The movie is very well written (co-written by the very man who did the comic book), with very realistic dialogue and characters.  The movie doesn't really feel like a movie, because it feels like real life.  You feel like you know these characters and have seen them before.  We all went to school with people like this at some point.  That's when you know when something really works--when you feel like you are there.<p>One of the great things about the movie is that there is not a big payoff in the end.  There's on grand finale or an ending that lets you know that everything is going to be all right.  I know this was a disappointment for some people, but I couldn't envision the film ending in any other way.  It's a realistic and beautiful moment.  And to me, that was the greatest payoff you could find.  It also shows you that this film refuses to conform to Hollywood standards, which is always refreshing.<p>The DVD has a few things to offer--&quot;few&quot; being the keyword here.  Don't get me wrong, I was happy with the features that were included, but I was hoping there'd be a few more goodies for a standout movie like this.  The picture and sound is very good, so no problems there.  Extras included are deleted and alternate scenes, a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, trailers and a music video.  I think a great opportunity was missed here, as this is the perfect movie that screams for a commentary from the cast and crew.  Despite the fact that it isn't loaded with a ton of extras, it's still a very nice package.<p>&quot;Ghost World&quot; is a phenomenal achievement in filmmaking, in my opinion.  True, it is not something that everybody will be head-over-heels for, but those who end up loving it will really appreciate it for what it is.  It's a film that takes risks and never falls into a basic movie formula.  If you're looking for a movie that is different from the rest, this is an excellent choice.  A superb film on all fronts. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

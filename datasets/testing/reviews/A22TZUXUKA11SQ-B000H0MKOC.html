It's funny because it's a film that can laugh at itself--and does so for nearly two hours.  For instance, in one scene the president of the Academy of Tobacco Studies says, "(Cigaretters) are cool, available, and addictive. The job's almost done for us."  This movie is satirical without being too over the top and that's what makes it great. I mean what isn't funny about a group of best friends who call themselves the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death) and work as lobbyists for the tobacco, alcohol, and firearms industries.  It's almost too much, but it's done so well that you can't help but laugh.  Also, one of the best parts of this movie is the far underrated performance of Adam Brody as the assistant of a Hollywood superagent played by Rob Lowe. Brody's scenes are some of the best in the movie and his immersion in the vapid, Los Angeles movie market makes for great movie-watching. I would definitely recommend Thank You for Smoking the next time you're in the mood for a laugh.</p></body></html>

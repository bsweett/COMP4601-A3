<meta name="summary" content="Those were the days...."></head><body><p>It was an era of great conspiracy and political thrillers -- "Seven Days in May", "Failsafe", and "The Manchurian Candidate" to name a few.<p>I remember seeing this film for the first time years ago in a drive-in movie  theater.  It was the second film to be playing that night (I can't remember  what played with it), and I was all set to use that time to cuddle up with  my date and have some fun.  That, of course, never happened.  This filmed  grabbed me like few others (luckily, my date was just as wrapped up as I  was).<p>This is a chilling, riveting film of political intrigue,  assassination, and ultimate mind control.  It was a film that Frank Sinatra  banned from public broadcast for over 25 years (due, I think, to the  assassination of President Kennedy).<p>Many films have tried to immulate  this shocking thriller, but I can't remember any coming close except those  listed above and "The Day of the Jackel".  (Note:  I said "The Day of the  Jackel" and not the inferior "The Jackel".).  If you've never seen this  film, go out immediately and rent it (you'll want to purchase it after  you've viewed this film -- it is a classic!!).  Between 1 and 10, "The  Manchurian Candidate" gets an unabashed 10.  It is truly one of a kind, and  very, very scary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MIRREN DOES A MAJESTIC JOB"></head><body><p>THE QUEEN is not what I would have suspected to be a great movie, due to its expected docu-stoggy approach and subject matter, but it is -- a great movie. And Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II will forever in my mind be the real queen, she did such a majestic job. The story takes place in the week after Prncess Diana's tragicly premature death in a 1997 Paris automobile crash and leads up to her public funeral. Interspersed with actual news footage of Diana and the grieving crowds, the film goes behind closed doors to look at how the Royal Family and the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, reacted to these events. Educational as well as entertaining, THE QUEEN is an absorbing study of how families cope in terrible crisis, in this case, the royal and top political families. THE QUEEN also shows how protocol is handled with the Queen and daily life of her household. Fascinating on many levels, THE QUEEN is one of the best films of the last ten years.</p></body></html>

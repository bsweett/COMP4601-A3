<meta name="summary" content="One down, two down, three down horror movie pattern"></head><body><p>"The Grey" is the latest film from writer/director Joe Carnahan, who's previous outings all had a dark and moody feel to them, although this movie is a definitely a different turn for him. Most of his movies are set in urban environments, like "Narc", "Smokin' Aces" and "Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane" and "The Grey" is far far far from anything urban.<br /><br />The movie is about an Alaskan oil drilling team that is on their way to a big job when their plane drops out of the sky and in the middle of a snowy tundra and there are only seven survivors. They are held prisoner by the elements and are forced to adapt to the very assurance that they will most likely die. They are led by a team sniper named Ottway, played by Liam Neeson, who is along for the trip because of his ability to shoot wolves and protect the workers. This is a skill that certainly comes in handy as they are greeted by a pack of wolves on night one.<br /><br />On top of dealing with bitter cold, wounds from the plane crash and knowing that they won't be found anytime soon, the wolves that don't eat but kill become an overwhelming obstacle. "The Grey" has a very dark overtone, as probably goes without saying. It is definitely a testosterone movie, filled with men being men and men figuring out ways to survive as long as they can.<br /><br />I would be amiss if I stated that the movie didn't hold my attention throughout, but there is much about "The Grey" that left me with a disappointing taste in my mouth. First of all, the movie plays out like a horror movie with its predictable one at a time story layout. There have been many movies similar to this in the past, like "Alive" and "The Edge" where a man had to survive a grizzly bear, and "The Edge" managed to hold you on the edge of your seat throughout. It was unpredictable and frightening. "The Grey" is very predictable and once you see the pattern, you know it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />The movie leaves you with a empty feeling as it explores life, religion, hope and death throughout. You get to know the men who are facing impossible odds and you root for them till the end. Yet, "The Grey" is what it is, a dark, moody, dreary story about living and dieing.</p></body></html>

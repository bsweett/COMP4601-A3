<meta name="summary" content="Average Crime Comic Book Flick"></head><body><p>Road to Perdition is a pretty stiff flick.  It aspires to be an art house picture complete with pretentious cinematography.  It features a criminal father who tries to teach his son all the usual important life lessons that so many movies also teach.<br /><br />Road to Perdition is based on a "graphic novel" that is synonymous for a comic book that is expensive, long, pretentious and done in black and white.  This particular work purports to be based on real people, but in reality, the only things real about it is the names of the characters and the names of the places that it is set in.  Otherwise, both the original graphic novel and the movie that is based on it have zero connection to real history.<br /><br />Road to Perdition has the kind of illogical plotting, numerous murders, lack of real women, goofy psychology and a general lack of insight that so many other Hollywood crime flicks have.  Basically, this movie is an exercise in absurdity.<br /><br />For instance, in order to get a shot at the man who murdered most of his family, the killer hero (Tom Hanks) decides to try to force the Chicago mob of Al Capone to release the man by stealing from Capone.  In real life, Al Capone always struck back at those who stole from him.  He never negotiated with those who sought to torment him.  The real Capone would have made short work of Hanks's character.<br /><br />There are other unrealistic elements to Road to Perdition.  Real life gang killers are a hard drinking, hard living lot who beat their women and pay cold shrift to their children.  Tom Hanks's killer is a quiet, solemn man who is a devoted family man.  A real life serial killer would never, ever apologize to his nine year old son for missing his school concert.  Also, Jude Law's killer reporter character who kills people and then takes their photographs and sells them to newspapers is a villain who much better would fit in a Batman type movie than in the oh so realistic Road to Perdition.<br /><br />All in all, Road to Perdition is just another Hollywood crime flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Love-Story Animation Movie I've ever seen so far (April 2011)"></head><body><p>I don't like animation movie much. I've watched approximately 20 of them such as Snow White, Wall-e, Lion King, Finding Nemo, Mulan, Dumbo, etc. Tangled is the only one that I bought a copy of its DVD because I love it so much. The reasons why are listed below.<br /><br />- The face movements of the main characters such as the horse and Flynn and are lively and so human-like that they captivate me. For example when the horse was angry with Flynn, it frowned its face just like a man! It's hilarious and fascinating. Or when Flynn tried to convince Rapunzel to give him back the the tiara, he raised one of his eybrows and half-closed his eyes. The facial expression was just like that of a man who's trying to come up with a trick.<br /><br />- There are a lot of humour.<br /><br />- Most of the time, the color are bright and beautiful. It does birghten up my mood.<br /><br />- The animals do not speak human language. This feature makes this film more suitable for adults like me.<br /><br />- There are two scenes that touch my heart the most. The first is when Flynn rather faced death than let Rapunzel endanger herself by healing his mortal wound. The second is the reunion of Rapunzel and her parents.<br /><br />It's the only animation movie that I've bought so far. It's one of my 3 best love-story movies. The others are: Ghost (Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg),  and Just Like Heaven (Reese Witherspoon, Mark Ruffalo).</p></body></html>

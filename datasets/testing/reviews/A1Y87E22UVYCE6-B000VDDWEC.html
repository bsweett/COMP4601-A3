<meta name="summary" content="Outrageous Disease!"></head><body><p>Englishman director Danny Boyle with a relatively short production has delivered some good, even if controversial, movies as: "Trainspotting" (1996) and "The Beach" (2000). Here he approaches horror-Sci-Fi releasing a very good film of the genre: "28 Days Later" (2002).<br /><br />The story starts with a small gang of activists entering a lab and involuntary releasing a fateful plague.<br /><br />Next scene occurs 28 days later, focusing on Jim, who has been unconscious at a hospital, recovering from an accident.<br /><br />He wakes up to an empty world crying "Hello" and receiving no answer. Depopulated London images ensue. Jim suddenly discovers zombie-like people running after him. He is miraculously rescued by a survivor couple.<br /><br />Hair raising scenes featuring zombies chasing survivors follows.<br /><br />Jim and his little bunch receive a radio transmission stating that near Manchester there is military post receiving escapees.<br /><br />So there they go in search of sanctuary.<br /><br />Alas! Nothing is simple and when they arrive the story gives a new turn of the screw.<br /><br />The film contains some winks and makes homage to Romero's Zombie series as the scene of "free shopping". There are also strong reminiscences to Wyndham's masterpiece "The Day of the Triffids" as Jim's opening scenes and the fortified surrounded military post.<br /><br />Acting is good with Naomie Harris one step up of the rest of the cast.<br /><br />I consider this an intelligent film that may be enjoyed by sci-fi fans, horror buffs and action movies lovers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

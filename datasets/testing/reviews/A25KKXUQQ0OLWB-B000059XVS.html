<meta name="summary" content="One of the Great Films!"></head><body><p>One of my favorite movies from a young age.  Peter O'Toole is the great star of the film and Omar Sharif became a major star with this movie.  Lawrence of Arabia is a true character.  A man who in World War I was able to gather Arab tribes to bring down much of the Ottoman Empire while the rest of the British effort on the Eastern Front seemed to fail and die on the vine.  Becoming one with the Arabs and learning to survive in their environment and enjoy the life of the desert allowed him to be much more able to achieve British goals.  He also attempted to defy the British government by pushing for Arab independence rather than British Imperialism.  Wonderful movie and a great acheivement by David Lean.</p></body></html>

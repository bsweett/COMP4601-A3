<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood, in his Penultimate Performance..."></head><body><p>If "Gran Torino" actually proves to be Clint Eastwood's final appearance as an actor (and he has said so), I can't think of a more fitting swansong; his portrayal of an antisocial, racist widower, facing his own mortality while relearning compassion from his hmong neighbors, is a magnificent performance, certainly one of his best. It combines elements of many of his classic characters, with the subtlety and depth 50 years on both sides of the camera has taught him. Some will howl at his language and obvious bigotry, but without this coarseness, we would not truly understand his pain, or fully appreciate his spiritual rebirth.<br /><br />This may sound crazy, but I found myself comparing "Gran Torino" with "The Shootist", John Wayne's final film. Both films involve protagonists who are dying of cancer, mentoring boys, and ultimately ending their lives while ridding society of a dangerous element. With due respect for Wayne, I believe the Eastwood film is far superior; Eastwood's characterization is much deeper, the 'community' is portrayed in a kinder fashion, and the resolution is both smarter, and more effective. The film offers humor, as well, an element largely missing in the Wayne film.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a film guaranteed to be on the short list of Eastwood's finest; I'm proud to have it in my DVD collection!</p></body></html>

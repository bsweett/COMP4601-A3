<meta name="summary" content="A truly HAUNTING film!!!"></head><body><p>Over the lifetime, I often read reviews of films in which the critic proclaims a film to be "haunting."  I always chalked that up to hyperbole...until I saw CHILDREN OF MEN.  It's been almost three weeks since I saw it...and feelings and moods and images from the film still revisit me from time to time.  It's a feeling that's pretty new to me, and I've seen 3000 or more films in my life.<br /><br />It's not that the film is perfect...I've certainly seen films that leave me more shaken, more entertained, more impressed or more moved to action.  But CHILDREN OF MEN soaked me in an atmosphere and a mood and a world in such a specific, complete manner that some of it's images are almost like sense memory to me now.  I think the last time I had a similar feeling was in about 1980 when I first saw David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN, which left me so shaken that I had to go again and again in the same week.  I'm planning on seeing CHILDREN OF MEN again soon, and may have to go a third time.<br /><br />I don't think I need to rehash the basic plot...others have done that pretty well.  One thing I feel I must comment on is the criticism I've seen in a few places that there isn't any plot, or that we don't know what's going on in this futuristic society.  To me, that's almost laughable.  How many people wanted to know why the earth became the way it did in BLADE RUNNER?  Or SILENT RUNNING?  We accept the world presented to us.  I think part of the power of CHILDREN OF MEN is that it set in a not very distant future, where the world is turned upside-down...and yet it feels possible.  The landscapes, cityscapes, technology, clothing, etc. that we see look very familiar.  It feels like today, or maybe just next year.  And yet we don't recognize the society, the politics, etc.  It's deeply unsettling to see a "future" that feels so totally possible.  So bleak, and yet so credible.<br /><br />True, we don't know exactly why no one has had children in nearly two decades.  Would the narrative drive of this movie work better if we did know?  Would having that one little answer make the film suddenly perk to life for skeptical viewers?  I find it hard to believe.  I had no problem not knowing...I can fill that blank in for myself.  Otherwise, I think the socio-political climate in the Great Britain presented in the film is VERY easy to glean.  There's some easy to swallow exposition and then off we go with the film.<br /><br />It is the story of one man, Theo, played brilliantly by Clive Owen.  He looks weary, furrowed, troubled, smart, cynical, heroic, handsome, dirty, smelly.  It's probably too late for Oscar attention for him...but it's an Oscar worthy performance.  He's so easy to like, and yet he's very much an anti-hero.  But during the film, we see him come to life...to suddenly have something to live for.  That's what the movie is about.  Not plot twists.  Not this happened, then this, then this.  It's about one man (living in a society where he already knows the background of what's happened...why would the film tell US?) who is just going through the motions of living.  Then some events unfold that jolt him back into engaging in the world and actually working to make a difference.  It's effective.<br /><br />Also, I have to address the violence and some viewer's criticism of it.  Yep, it's violent.  It's graphic, but not over the top.  Lots and lots of people die, but the camera doesn't linger over the nasty results.  In fact, people die most often on the fringes of the film.  The camera pans, and just as it passes someone in the background, they drop from a gunshot and are seen no more.  It's highly effective in giving us a sense of the sudden death that awaits in this new society.<br /><br />There are many specific parts of the film that I loved.  Michael Caine's joyful performance.  Theo's ongoing problems with footwear (don't ask).  The way in which the midwife character in the film is suddenly yanked out of the story (the whole scene showing Theo's arrival at the detention camps is amazingly well done...just look out the bus window as the scenes roll by).  The scene when Kee's secret is first revealed to the general populace and their reaction.  It's all stunning and moving.<br /><br />The movie is very gray, and bleak.  Yet there are just enough glimmers of hope to make it bearable.  Theo's redemption alone make it worth taking this difficult journey.  I felt exhausted after watching it...but also so impressed with the craftsmanship and the feelings I was grappling with.<br /><br />So now I sound like a real touchy-feely guy.  That's not me!  But for CHILDREN OF MEN, the best thing I can say is that it was haunting.  This is a film that you must see and experience for yourself.  I guess you might not like it...others didn't...but if you do like it, you'll be SO glad you didn't miss it.  And see it on the big screen.</p></body></html>

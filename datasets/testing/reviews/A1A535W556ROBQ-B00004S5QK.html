<meta name="summary" content="Too much fun!"></head><body><p>Delightful movie that not only showcases Gene Kelly's wonderful talents, but that of Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds as well. This movie has a great sense of humor, poking fun at the early talkies in Hollywood, as Kelly and O'Connor team up to put on a new musical.  Debbie Reynolds is not content to supply the voice for the screechy voiced Jean Hagen, who is the reigning star of Hollywood.  Hagen gets her come-uppance in the end in a riotous closing sequence.  But, the signature piece remains the scene where Kelly quite literally dances in the rain after being smitten by the lovely Debbie Reynolds, who seems so fresh and fair in this movie, like an April flower.  The three lead actors play so beautifully off each other, making this one of the most memorable musicals of that era.</p></body></html>

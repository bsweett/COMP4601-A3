<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - Weir 'Commands' 'Master'ful Film"></head><body><p>Do you feel you are missing films thanks to your local Cineplex, which only features the most high-profile projects, and therefore excludes independent features? Or do you ever feel that by taking a weekend or so off from the movies that you missing some great films? And then you hear you friends chatting about them, it makes the already bad situation even worse? Many can lay claim to being in that very situation, missing out on noting-worthy independent and less commercial films that eventually found their way to be acknowledged by the Motion Picture Academy at the 76th Annual Academy Awards in February 2004, while others weren't quite so lucky. Such note-worthy features that failed to receive recognition include Bad Santa, Phone Booth and The Singing Detective. This isn't to say that nominated projects such as Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Cold Mountain, and Lost in Translation aren't worthy of acknowledgment, far from it. It is to say this one thing in Hollywood has yet to change: The bigger the studio, the bigger the trophy case will be.<p>The story is based on the tenth novel, "The Far Side of the World" in the "Master and Commander" series by Patrick O'Brian, who wrote twenty installments of the high-seas adventure series until his death in January 2000. The feature starts off in 1806 - Napoleon has proclaimed himself emperor of France after a failed attempt on his life and from there wages a military campaign which conquers Italy, Genoa, Vienna, and most of Austria and Germany. The Third Coalition, which consisted of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Sweden, has all but been decimated by severe defeats on land, thus leaving Britain and its advanced naval sea power as the only thing standing in the way of Napoleon and total victory over Europe. One of Britain's most impressive ships is the HMS Surprise, captained by the ambitious and commanding Jack Aubrey, who travels the world with his friend Stephen Maturin, who is also the ship's doctor. Along the Eastern coast of South America, Aubrey and his crew are ambushed by the French frigate, the Acheron. Though they escape in relatively one piece, the ship is deeply weakened and there is talk of turning back home to England. Faced with the fate of his crew and his country in his hand, Jack Aubrey must show true leadership by putting everything on the line and making quick decisions, no matter the cost. The story for Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of the few films out there that embroils itself deeply in a certain time period of history but doesn't require its audience to have such extensive knowledge of events that it alienates certain demographics. Though the film doesn't demand background knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars, it certainly wouldn't hurt if you go in with at least some idea of the events that the story surrounds itself with.<p>Though Master & Commander contains a rather large cast, few have actually made a name for themselves that they are easily recognizable by a majority of the movie-going audience but that doesn't matter so much in that only one person requires the audience's full attention, that being Russell Crowe. Crowe, who won an Academy Award for his performance in Gladiator and was nominated for A Beautiful Mind, was certainly worthy of at least a nomination with his commanding performance as Captain Jack Aubrey, in which he combines slight humor, enduring emotions, and dignified atmosphere that envelops the audience and keeps them focused with the actions on screen. Unfortunately, despite the film itself receiving ten nominations, the academy failed to recognize Crowe's amazing performance but that is easily forgettable as long as the audiences that watch this film get their money's worth of the film, thanks mostly to Crowe's engaging Jack Aubrey. And it's not just Crowe but the character's actions within the film itself ... the fact that he darts across the deck of the ship in an attempt to be almost everywhere at once, his ability to be charming and eloquent while playing his violin while being forceful and compelling in battle, and sticking to his guns despite certain opposition and small consequences that occur because of that decision.<p>Overall, Leadership, patriotism, and a true sense of responsibility and duty, all of which are desperately needed amongst a certain portion of the American people today, take center stage even away from Crowe's most commanding role to date. The most astonishing thing Peter Weir and his follow filmmakers have been able to do, besides elegantly and tastefully poking fun at the French, is to create a story that is slow and lumbering at times but not so much so that it results in a boring and lusterless feature, in fact Master & Commander is quite the opposite. It successfully keeps the audience members at the edge of their seats not only for the action occurring on screen but by keeping them in utter anticipation of events yet to unfold in the film as well. A beautifully mastered musical score, created by Christopher Gordon, Iva Davies and Richard Tognetti, keeps the historical time period in the context of the occurring actions in slower portions of the film while still engaging the audience with a rousing complement to the battle sequences. But the film's most powerful quality is its message of enduring leadership and dedication to one's country despite nearly impossible odds and the cost of friendship and life appearing to be worth more then the end result. The United States faces that exact challenge today but as the Jack Aubrey discovers, there is no more important value in life then a devotion to one's country and the commanding leadership that drives not only the crew but the heart and soul of one's country as well.</p></body></html>

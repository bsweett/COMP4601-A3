Being Victorian era England, corsets are tight, colours are drab and life is very strict. Everything for the upcoming wedding must be perfect. The local church pastor (Christopher Lee) has special vows for the couple to recite, and he, as well as their parents, are determined they get them exactly right. After humiliating himself at the marriage rehearsal, Victor wanders out of town into the dark forest to learn his vows properly. Role playing with the trees and twigs, Victor masters these vows, and confidently slides the ring onto what he believes to be a dead branch. But it is not a dead branch he has given his vows and ring to, it is a corpse of a bride named Emily (Helena Bonham-Carter), and she has taken his rehearsal very seriously indeed. As far as she is concerned, they are now married, and she whisks poor Victor away to the land of the dead, a world full of singing, dancing skeletons, spiders, green maggots, and blue faced corpses. Meanwhile, in the land of the living, a mysterious Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) has arrived on the scene, and wants Victoria to be HIS bride. Will Victor escape the world of the dead, and if he does, which bride will he marry?<br /><br />For stop motion animation, the film is incredibly slick. Every movement flows, and there are no jerky movements, which is usually a characteristic of stop motion (of the earlier stuff anyway). The look and Danny Elfman's score for the piece are typically Burton. I found Elfman's songs a little easier to digest than his ones for "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which was nice.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the casting of the film. There's Joanna Lumley (from British sitcom "Absolutely Fabulous") who plays Victoria's mother. There's Michael Gough (Alfred from the Burton "Batman" movies, and the Celestial Toymaker from "Doctor Who") as the skeleton Elder Gutknecht. Deep Roy (from "Big Fish" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory") sneaks in too, as the Napoleon-esque skelton. But my favourite of the bunch is British character actor Paul Whitehouse (from "The Fast Show") who plays several roles: Victor's father, Mayhew and the "Head" Waiter. He's also in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" as Sir Cadogan, if you want to keep an eye out. I really hope he does some more films, he's a very funny guy.<br /><br />Special features include a selection of making of featurettes, which contain not only Tim Burton's words on the film, but some behind the scenes footage and the words of several of the actors and crew, as well as Danny Elfman, who did the music and songs. There's no interview with Paul Whitehouse though, which was a shame, but you do get to see him in the "Voices Behind the Voice Featurette", where you get to watch selected scenes of the film and the actors voicing them in the studio simultaneously on the screen. Its interesting to watch, because sometimes a single line of script is edited from several takes (particularly Johnny Depp's, I noticed), and the footage of the actor in the booth jumps about.<br /><br />There's also an original theatre trailer, a production gallery (that is, a montage of stop motion tests for the characters, among other things), and a music only track for the film.<br /><br />Recommended for lovers of Tim Burton and of animation. To "The Corpse Bride" you'll soon say "I do... like this movie".</p></body></html>

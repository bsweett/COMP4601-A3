No disrespect to Leo, but it seemed to me that in this production that Winslet blew Dicaprio out of the water.  Dicaprio has proven he can play a wide range of characters but a '50 suit man-not so much.  It's not that he was bad, it's just that Winslet ws just so much better.  I could absolutely feel her angst even when I didn't agree with her choices.  The book is still in my TBR pile, I can't wait to get to it so see how everything stacked up.</p></body></html>

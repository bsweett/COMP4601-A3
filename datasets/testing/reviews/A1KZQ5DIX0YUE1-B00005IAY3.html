<meta name="summary" content="Great BD Choice"></head><body><p>Marketing experts, pay attention: this is how you should package all classic films. All three versions of the film, a retrospective look at the making of the films (note the plural), story boards, deleted scenes, the 'Watch the Skies' featurette, several audio and video options (standard def v. high def, DTS 5.1 in three languages, etc) and wide accessibility through about a dozen languages worth of subtitles. There is enclosed a nice 30th anniversary booklet with a lot of pics, trivia and retrospective. We don't get commentary, but we do get a Editor's Fast Track that pretty much does the same trick.<br /><br />If you like science fiction, chances are you've already seen this. If you are a fence sitter, wondering if the BD is worth it, the special features alone scream 'yes!' For once, you can't complain about sound or video thanks to all the alternate settings. So you don't have to suffer a bad transfer. Instead you are left following the wonder of normal folk who experience first contact. Watch them question their lives and become infected with the promise of something more than their banal lives. This is a much more cerebral film than most other 'first contacts'. Here, we are promised something different, a learning experience, a chance of friendship.<br /><br />It's all too rare to find movies with a positive resolution instead of cheering on a heroic character that might or might not deserve said cheer. We're left with a hopeful wondering of our future, and that has so much more of a payoff than anything that has come since.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Vietnam war movie"></head><body><p>I've watched this movie several times, but the HD DVD version was the best.  It is a nice clean transfer in the original aspect ratio (the DVD release was cropped to 4:3 and highly compressed).  This is the definitive Vietnam war movie-great cast, dialogue, and editing.  I forgot that Adam Baldwin was in it (he also played my favorite character Jayne in Firefly and Serenity).  His role felt like an early prototype for Jayne.  And R Lee Armey was just fantastic.  This movie is not for the faint of heart, but I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

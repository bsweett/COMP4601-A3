I can't think of a single film that been a failure in exploring the undiscovered country.  "Ghost" was incredibly good, and even a movie like "Flatliners" was worth the price of admission.  I would put this one somewhere in between those two.  As far as the movie itself, it was well written and well directed, believably acted and of solid quality.<br /><br />I do wish that we had a chance to listen to George's letter to Marie at the end of the movie.  My viewing companion and I agree that it included something along the lines of: SPOILER ALERT "The girl you tried to hold on to and save wanted to say thank you."  But that is something only Peter Morgan would be able to confirm.</p></body></html>

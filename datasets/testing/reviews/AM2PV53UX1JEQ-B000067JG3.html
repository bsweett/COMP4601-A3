<meta name="summary" content="IRRESISTABLE"></head><body><p>This Rodgers and Hammerstein show has been lambasted for years for being a sugary, wafer-thin confection, as opposed to some of their other, darker works -- Carousel chief among them.  However, taken on its own terms, how  can anyone resist the spectacular, melody-soaked movie, which is MUCH  better than the stage play?  Julie Andrews is so engaging you wish she was  your friend, if not your nanny.  The children are wooden at times, but the  score soars above nearly everyone's heads, and set in the stunning Swiss  Alps, and in Salzburg, Austria, which has to be one of the most picturesque  towns in the world, each musical number transports the viewer to a place of  joy -- maybe even nirvana.  The opening sequence, often satirized, remains  one of the most technically sophisticated and creative series of shots ever  put on film.  Each time I see this movie, the first shots of snow, with  whistling wind, stir an age-old excitement deep in my soul, and then --  woosh! -- you are on the expertly crafted emotional ride that is The Sound  of Music.  Christopher Plummer deserves special mention -- he is the one  performer in this movie who delivers a subtle, heartbreakingly real  performance, and he is without a doubt the most dashing Capt. Von Trapp  ever.  Angela Cartwright would later star in Lost In Space, though the rest  of the kids have been kind of missing in action. I think I have seen this  movie 30 times.</p></body></html>

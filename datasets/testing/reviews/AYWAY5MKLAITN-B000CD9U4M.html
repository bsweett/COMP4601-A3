<meta name="summary" content="The Remake of a classic."></head><body><p>When I first heard that they were doing a remake I was totally shocked and worried. Gene Wilder did such a good job that I was reluctant to go see this one. But, as soon as I heard that Johnny Depp was playing Wonka and that Tim Burton was directing all my worries just dirfted away. What I like about this one is that it's not exactly the same as the original. After watching the other one a million times . . . I was expecting something different. The sets were real, people. No CGI there. The acting was hilarious and all the characters gave something different to the remake. But, however possible, in this one, Wonka slightly takes on a creepier tone. Gene wilder was playful, but in this one, Wonka almost has a glimmer of sadism in his eyes. Watch the Sqirrel scene, you'll see what I'm talking about. Anyhow, the misfortunes of the children were very funny and gave me back the memories from before. The only thing that I really didn't like were two very distinctive things:<br /><br />One, the oompa loompas were totally wrong. All of them looked depressed or just plain angry. Not like the orange-faced goof balls in the last one.<br /><br />Two, the songs were not as pleasing. They say that the songs were taken straight from the book. The whole movie, in fact is based soley on the book, give or take a few scenes, while the original was made with a genrally understanding of the book. But, all in all, the 1974 WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACOTRY still does better at the songs. That's my opinion. But the movie still is enjoyable.<br /><br />Final Verdict: The Shananigans are back.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

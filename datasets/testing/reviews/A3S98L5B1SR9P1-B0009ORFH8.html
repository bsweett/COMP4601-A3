<meta name="summary" content="George A. Romero's Groundbreaking Horror Film!"></head><body><p>I just don't know what it is about this movie that grabs my attention. It doesn't matter what you do, where you run, or where you hide. They are there! There is no escape! They won't stop til you are dead! The original 1968 Night of The Living Dead is a true horror masterpiece. The zombies are...awesome, to say the least. When a few characters are killed by an exploding car, the film continues with a grotesque display of the zombies eating the left over body parts. The actors (especially Duane Jones) did a wonderful job, especially since this was their first movie! The ending, in my opinion, is probably the best ending in any movie of the genre. I won't spoil it for you, but even the grizzly images during the credits will make you think.<br /><br />As for the 30th anniversary edition, I advise everyone who is a fan of this film, or someone who has never seen this film before to avoid it as much as possible. They add a new beginning with two guys driving the casket of the first zombie (the first one we see in the cemetery played by Bill Heinzman) from the prison where he was just executed to the cemetery where he's to be interred. A cheesy bald priest and the parents of the little girl that the dead guy apparently killed are there waiting for the body. The girl's father wants to see his body to make sure...and then spits on it and leaves with the girl's mother. The dead guy stirs, gets up, and bites the priest...then he wanders away leading us to the REAL beginning of the movie. They took out the whole "driving up to the cemetery" stuff from the original, and begin the older footage with Barbara and Johnny stopping and getting out.<br /><br />During the film, they've added a car crash family of zombies, as well as some zombies from the Diner where Ben came from (all played by family members and friends of the "film makers"). Some feeding stuff...nothing big.<br /><br />Finally, at the end, after Ben is shot, they superimpose a "One Year Later" and show some reporter going to visit the cheesy priest in the hospital. He didn't die from his wound, because of "prayer" and crap like that. Oh, and he has a dog named "Mewshew" (not sure if that's the spelling...but that's definitely the pronunciation) that he has so that, in case he DOES turn into a zombie, he can chow down on it rather than some person who's near by.<br /><br />Anyway, it's HORRIBLE. The acting of the new people is just pathetic...especially the priest (who just happened to do the new score for the movie...which was equally horrible). Also, they said how they "seamlessly" intercut the old footage with the new, and how Bill Heinzman looked exactly how he looked back then due to the great make up FX...but that was utter *beep* Very sad. Very pathetic. Avoid it.<br /><br />The original Night of The Living Dead is a true horror classic that should not be missed. Avoid the 30th anniversary edition!<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old</p></body></html>

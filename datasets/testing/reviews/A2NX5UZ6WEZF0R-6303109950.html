He plays doc holiday, and he makes the movie worth watching, and kurt russell is also worthy. I also enjoyed Dana Delany becvause she is beautiful and a great actress. The main reason why this movie was so good was the great lines. I GOT TWO GUNS, ONE FOR EACH OF YA! Just alot of western bad ass talk that we all love and reminds us of DO YOU FEEL LUCKY WELL DO YA PUNKS clint eastwood movies. It's all good and fun. It's basically about the ok corall, and mostly a true story but as with all movies, some of it exaggerated and obviously for enteratinment, not boring documentaries and they couldnt have chosen better actors than russell and kilmir.</p></body></html>

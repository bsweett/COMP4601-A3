<meta name="summary" content="Problematic attempt at a serious spy film"></head><body><p>Beautifully lit and shot (the movie looks like "The Godfather, Part II"), "The Good Shepherd" is nevertheless long, mostly dull, and muddled in its message.  Is the film saying that Matt Damon's character honored his beliefs and ideals during his CIA career, compromised them, or a combination of both?  It just wasn't clear how he felt about things, or even (equally unhelpful) how complicit he was in certain activities.  And while I don't begrudge Angelina Jolie playing the occasional unglamorous role, her shrill wife character seemed a waste of her talents.  "The Good Shepherd" gets a few points for looking good, a handful of tense scenes, and some good supporting performances (including one by director Robert De Niro), but overall it was a disappointment.  The DVD looks and sounds great, and features a selection of deleted scenes (revealing an entire excised subplot about the Angelina Jolie character's brother) as its sole special feature.</p></body></html>

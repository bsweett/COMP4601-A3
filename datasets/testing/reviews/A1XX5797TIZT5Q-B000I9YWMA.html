<meta name="summary" content="Grisly, well-made thriller."></head><body><p>Despite all the negative reviews, I really liked this film.  Sure, the material isn't new, but for once it's refreshing to see a story that's so blatantly in the realm of the exploitation film being tackled by A-list talent in Hollywood style.<p>The Hughes brothers have a gift for implementing extremely stylish techniques without seeming show-offy.  The &quot;absinthe&quot; visions in the film as experienced by Johnny Depp's character serve to enhance the mood rather than show off the latest cinematic trick.  The Hugheses do seem fond of extremely graphic violence as seen in Dead Presidents; in From Hell, when a cop says a victim is &quot;in pieces&quot;, the directors show no mercy in sparing you the sight.  However, the highly grisly content has a purpose -- it deprives you of the sense of safety that a &quot;polite&quot; shooting style often yields, and it also blends the two ideas of social decay and aristocratic decadence which both the story and the cinematography express.<p>Depp does a fine job here, though the role of Inspector Abberline isn't exactly his most challenging.  But he is sympathetic and charismatic, projecting intelligence and a troubled psyche.  Heather Graham looks ravishingly beautiful, and I didn't have a huge problem with her accent -- certainly leagues above Julia Roberts' feeble attempt in Michael Collins.  Depp and Graham make for a great pair onscreen, and the screenplay has enough good lines to keep you interested throughout.  Ian Holm does walk off with the film, though, as supra-genius surgeon Sir William Gull.<br />For me, the only truly weak point of the film is the endless scenes with the streetwalkers.  They are a pretty colourful bunch, and there are some highly talented actresses in their midst -- including Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp, both of Mike Leigh's Naked, Estelle Skornik, and Susan Lynch, who did a marvellous job in the film Nora.  But the scenes with them are so repetitive that the film's pacing suffers.<p>Small gripe, though -- with amazing lighting and design (including painstakingly accurate recreations of the murder sites), good performances and a nice sense of forward momentum, this film is a good (and lavish) addition to the Jack the Ripper canon.</p></body></html>

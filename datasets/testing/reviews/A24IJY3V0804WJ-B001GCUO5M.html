<meta name="summary" content="Fine adaptation of Lehanes book"></head><body><p>Inception was a mind bender of a movie and people loved it but I fail to understand that the same people have ignored a similar themed Shutter Island. Based on Dennis Lehane's book Shutter Island is the story of two U.S. Marshalls, who go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patients Rachel Solando who has disappeared from a mental asylum on that island.  The duo set out to investigate the mysterious happenings and confront a shocking ending.<br />I thought the movie was excellent in all respects and a great adaptation of a fine book. It is hard to adapt great books but the movie does just that. The direction was first rate which was expected of a director like Martin Scorcese. Leonardo Caprio delivers a fine performance and I think is on his way to become one of the finest actors of his generation. The end of the movie was haunting and the viewer has to watch the movie carefully or twice to understand the twister. If you cannot, I suggest watch the making of instead. I loved the film. 3 stars.</p></body></html>

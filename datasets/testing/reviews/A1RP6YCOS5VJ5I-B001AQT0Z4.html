<meta name="summary" content="A Movie That Has To Be Seen To Be Believed"></head><body><p>Even thought Reservoir Dogs got him noticed in the States, it was this film that really made everyone see that a genius story writer and director had been born. Always paying homage to the kinds of films he grew up with, Quentin comes through with Pulp Fiction. A brilliant story about two worn out hit men that are basically tired of their jobs, at least one of them is. The side-story of the Boxer who has a bounty on his head for not throwing the fight is equally as interesting of a story.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman...the list goes on about how many great actors and actresses are in this film. If the characters aren't believable, the movie is a bust and not good, but each did a great job at fitting their roles perfectly. The acting added a lot to the well written story. There is even a cameo by QT himself in the film. I don't know. This film is so great; it's hard to put into words on how great it is. Words don't really do it justice; it has to be seen to be believed. You will love this movie if you haven't seen it already. It's definitely one of the best films to come out of the 90's.</p></body></html>

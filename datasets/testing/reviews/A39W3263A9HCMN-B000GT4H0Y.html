I rented this, and gave up in the middle. Here's why:<br /><br />-The Plot.<br /><br />-The S/FX= HORRIBLE!<br /><br />-It's lame attempt at being a cyberpunk movie, but fails! You want a good cyberpunk movie, watch A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.<br /><br />-The martial arts. Gimme a f***ing break! THey look like they're drunk and tring to do the can-can whenever they kick.<br /><br />-The acting= HORRIBLE!.<br /><br />-The city looks horrible.<br /><br />You want a good sci-fi flick? Thet's why you have THE MATRIX.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Return to the 'Hood"></head><body><p>Singleton returns to the 'hood.  This time to Detroit to seek revenge for a fallen mother.  To his credit, he tries to cross racial lines by coming up with four foster brothers, two black, two white, and the ex-hippie white mama who raised them.  He tries to blend action with social commentary but it is like oil and water, with the result being a disjointed film that barely manages to keep its head above water.  Wahlberg puts in the most compelling performance as the older brother who feels he can muscle himself through any situation.  Andre Benjamin has a more complex role as he tries to balance his family with the return of his three prodigal brothers, but in the end the four take on the lawless neighborhood like the James gang, cleaning up the Detroit suburb terrorized by a ruthless gangster, while invoking images of their dead mom. Great for teenagers who want something a little more than the usual action flick, but Singleton has yet to recapture the form he exhibited in "Boyz in the Hood."</p></body></html>

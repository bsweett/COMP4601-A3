<meta name="summary" content="Another remake, but I liked it.................."></head><body><p>As a huge fan of the first Fog and also a huge fan of John Carpenter (I even like his bad movies, I loved Ghosts Of Mars and Vampires, even Prince Of Darkness was cool, sorry) I was a bit worried when I found he was 'retooling' his original, but much to my surprise, it was not that bad. In fact, if I compare the two, this one had a couple of things going for it more then the first one did. The fist thing would be that this one goes much deeper and detailed about the history of Antonio Bay and the lepers and the founding fathers who supposedly 'saved' the town and how they did it. The first one rarely made any references to this, and now that I think about it, didn't have any flashbacks at all, which are not always great for movies, but I think with this story, they were necesary. The flashbacks are rich in detail, very well presented down to the wardrobe and even the lingo. John Carpenter has always had a gift for elaborate sets and visuals and he more then continues that here. The second thing better about this Fog has got to be the special effects, they are very impressive. The fog itself is very creepy, and the ghosts and the ship are very scary and authentic.<br /><br />It does take the movie a while to get going, the first 30 minutes  are kinda slow, but once it gets going, your interest will definitely pick up. There is also some really cool death scenes and some pretty good suspense in some of the deeper fog scenes. I'd also like to give this movie some credit, you'd think with a theme like fog, some of the picture and scenery would be hard to see, the fist movie did have some problems with that, but not this one. You can see every scene shot in the fog clearly, not missing anything due to grain or too much fog.<br /><br />Sounds like I really liked it huh? well, it ain't all perfect people. The acting is pretty average, with a cast nobody would really know except for Selma Blair and if you watched alot of regular TV, which I don't, TV sucks. Tom Welling from WB's or UPN's (whats the difference) Tv show Smallville plays our main character/hero Nick. He is a pretty boy but a rather bland actor, and his girlfriend is played by Maggie Grace, from that show everyone can't live without, Lost. She suffers from the same problem Tom does, pretty to look at until she opens her mouth. Selma Blair does the only decent acting in the movie and though she is a main character, she is completely lost in the shuffle during the climax of the movie. Selma plays Stevie Wayne, the DJ from the lighthouse that Adrienne Barbeau played so perfectly in the first movie.<br /><br />I want to warn all of you, there are alot of details and plot points that are easy to miss, surprisingly, it's a pretty complicated plot that my wife and I had to watch twice because we have one of those roomates who can't shut the hell up during a movie!!! So we missed quite a bit during the last half hour and alot happened, but it all made sense after the second viewing and again I was really impressed with the storytelling.<br /><br />I read alot of your reviews and I think alot of people are tanking this for the wrong reasons. He didn't do this as a remake, or a sequel, he was very strict when he said he wanted to 'retool' it, he felt the first one was too vague and alot of people, even though they loved it, had alot of questions. Another reviewer claims he can't understand why the first one is considered a classic. I think if you look at most avid movie fans top 10 horror movies, The Fog is on 3 out 4, guaranteed!! I own the first one, and I'm pretty sure I will buy this, it's a good horror movie, and even though it also got the stupid 'unrated' tag, I highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one. I also rented Waiting with Ryan Reynolds, so I'll let ya know how that one was soon, I heard it was funny as hell...we'll see, catch ya later!!!<br /><br />acting.......2 stars, Avoided the dreaded 1 star thanks to Blair<br />directing......3.5 stars, Stigmata's Wainwright does a faithfull adaptation<br />special effects.....3.5 stars, Ghosts and the ship are way cool, the actual fog is something to see as well<br />horror rating....3 stars, Some suspense, more eerie then scary<br />quality.....3.5 stars, Had disaster written all over it, and while most think it was, I think it looked great, definite improvements over the first one while lacking the original's 'charm'</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Taut Suspense and Intrigue"></head><body><p>The Bourne Supremacy, the sequel to "The Bourne Identity," is a tightly wound thriller about a CIA operative with partial amnesia - he doesn't remember who he is, but he knows how to outsmart even the most savvy enemy.  Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) lives in Goa with his girlfriend (Franka Potente), trying to piece his past together with snippets of dreams and memories that he writes in a scrapbook.  When their quiet life is shattered by the appearance of an assassin, Bourne is thrust back into his old life of intrigue and danger.<br /><br />The intelligence behind the script keeps this film moving forward at a rapid, engaging clip, but the cinematography can be downright confusing.  One massive car chase is so dizzying that it is impossible to tell what is going on:  it's like watching three card Monty with a hundred cards, and you lose track of where people are.  Despite this, car chase fans will love the exhilarating screech of metal against metal, with cars flying everywhere.  The many plot levels that the film explores - the CIA's pursuit, Bourne's struggle to remember who he was, the assassins operating on their own agenda - keeps the viewer's interest from start to finish.  Damon does a good job of imbuing Bourne with a small amount of humanity struggling to assert itself.<br /><br />This film belongs to Matt Damon, and Damon fans won't be disappointed.  Fans of thrillers and action movies will love the taut suspense.</p></body></html>

In both cases, products are packaged not on merit - much less vision - but on marketability.  Candidates don't bravely craft innovative platforms and then sell their merits to the public, they simply figure out what the public wants to hear and then devise catchy ways of saying it.  Likewise, many filmmakers avoid artistic risk and creativity, settling instead for products that will sell.  Nancy Meyers, who wrote and directed The Holiday, has clearly targeted women as her market, particularly women who are drawn to frothy, weepy, dim-witted romanticism and sentimentality.  In What Women Want, she actually hit some high notes.  In The Holiday, poor writing, a clich&eacute; fiesta, plot predictability, and ham-fisted direction combine to make a vacation from reality certain to have you craving home.<br /><br />Among the film's innumerable flaws is the high percentage of "movie jobs," - not to be confused with real jobs that real people pursue.  Everyone has pots of money and works as a journalist, book editor, popular writer, movie trailer editor, movie score composer, hot air balloonist, or itinerant Marcel Marceau impersonator.  Amanda, Cameron Diaz, lives in a house so ostentatious it would embarrass Pablo Escobar.  Those looking for a shred of reality should look elsewhere.  The premise - swapping houses and lives with an absolute stranger - is equally far-fetched.  Though it is an actual practice, it's unlikely to happen at the drop of a hat as it does here.<br /><br />Plenty of eye candy, which helps to make the interminable 135-minutes running time slightly less unforgivable, the English countryside is appealing.  The cast is top shelf, and manages to create some good moments despite the appalling script.  Jude Law is excellent, and Cameron Diaz is not far behind.  Many appealing moments between these two, especially discovering the "Tent."  There is real tenderness and depth in seeing Graham, Law, and his two young daughters with Amanda; Graham is now revealing the entirety of his life to Amanda, and Amanda is finally getting an idea of love as commitment, not merely entertainment.  The Holiday could have used more moments like this.<br /><br />Most puzzling is how the other shoe is never quite dropped, Iris, Kate Winslet, is completely wasted in this film.  She's a pro, and makes the most of what's there, but there ain't much there, there.  If the film had really explored the trading houses/trading lives idea, the Iris story would have to mirror the Amanda story, be just as strong, and intersect with it in surprising ways.  It does none of these things - indeed, Eli Wallach almost shuffles away with the L.A. part of the picture because nothing is happening.  Jack Black is horribly miscast, in fact, just how did Jack Black make it into show business in the first place?<br /><br />Men will dismiss this movie out of hand as sentimental twaddle.  But I like to think that women viewers understand they're being pandered to and will respond by asking, "Does Hollywood really believe we're this shallow?"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mad scientists vs. killer angel lizard"></head><body><p>Quite a few very icky (yes, that's a technical term) segments in this little cesspool of a movie.<br /><br />Scientists/geneticists with no morals. Corporation with no morals.  Very iffy science that is very fuzzily explained.  Warped ideas of love.  Warped ideas throughout.  Bestiality or is it incest?<br /><br />I thought by having Adrian Brody in this that there would be some semblance of respectability and/or storyline backing up this movie but I think the producers must have kidnapped Brody, drugged him senseless and then let him wander aimlessly and stonefaced through the muck.<br /><br />One of the worst movies ever!</p></body></html>

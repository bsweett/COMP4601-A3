<meta name="summary" content="Spectacular Ending"></head><body><p>THE OTHERS is every inch as good as SIXTH SENSE which you will be forgiven for thinking that they stole ideas from - but as many have stated, it was the other way around.  THE OTHERS was penned long before SIXTH SENSE.<p>Whatever, nothing can quite prepare you for the spectacular ending (which I won't give away). Let's just say that it had an impact on me.<p>Nicole Kidman is excellent as a housewife caring for her two children while her husband is away apparently fighting for the War. When everything starts to unfold, we learn that this is not the case.<p>THE OTHERS is an incredibly sad tale, and Kidman's performance is such that you really do feel sympathy for her character. The frustation, the heartache ....<p>A great film, but once you have seen the ending, there is little point in repeat viewings.</p></body></html>

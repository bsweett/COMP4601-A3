<meta name="summary" content="Bravo! One really great movie!"></head><body><p>This movie is truly a gem that demands multiple viewings. The director did a magnificent job as did the personnel involved in casting. Kudo's all around for everyone involved in the making of this film.<br />Please don't simply take the movie as popcorn fodder. Ask yourself some questions about the true nature of the relationship between Eli and Oskar. Is it an intimate (as possible), friendship or is it a cold and calculated servile relationship in development? My take leans heavily toward the latter.<br />The English language remake, "Let Me In", is incredibly inferior in every respect and only barely worth viewing. The dubbed version of this film is inferior to the sub-titled version and that opinion is from someone who usually finds subtitles annoying at best.<br />Just a great movie that is hard to review without ruining the film for first time viewers. The movie is truly a "must see".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the classic action movies of all time."></head><body><p>This is one of the landmark movies in action movie history.  It set the foundation for so many other movies that came after it.  &quot;Under Siege&quot; and &quot;Air Force One&quot; are two movies which were in many  ways replicates of this thriller.<p>&quot;Die Hard&quot; was Bruce Willis'  breakthru flick as far as the box office is concerned.  Instead of an  attitude-laden wise guy, Willis plays a New York cop who just wants to lead  a simple life &amp; has no wish to be a hero.  However, he gets caught up  in hostage situation in an L.A. skyscraper.  From that point on, Willis'  character must fight off the bad guys by himself while the F.B.I. and LAPD  are more interested in making him the scapegoat of the whole  debacle.<p>&quot;Die Hard&quot; does not let up on the amount of action  &amp; has no real dry spells where nothing is going on.  In fact, action  wise, it has probably the most &quot;punch&quot; of any action picture ever  made.  The 2nd &quot;Die Hard&quot; is o.k., the 3rd one is absurd &amp;  silly.  However, the original is by far the best &amp; will forever remain  an classic for those who love an adrenilene rush along w/their popcorn.</p></body></html>

On one level, "Oldboy" is a classic man-wrongly-accused story of the type Hitchcock did so well - but neither we nor Dae-Su know what he is accused of.  Indeed, "Oldboy" starts off as man-wrongly-punished - or is he?  Park sets up the camera and lets it remain stationary a la Kubrick for much of the movie, adding to the tension by making us unsure of when he will cut away.  And us Western viewers will wish he had cut away from some of the more gonzo horror scenes.  Asian horror is far more transgressive than American horror, and while this film does not descend to the same depths that a Takashi Miike film would, several scenes go beyond what we Americans are used to, even in a post-"Hostel" world.  Even the subject matter, which is revealed at the end, is much more transgressive than what we would expect from an American movie.<br /><br />Having said that, "Oldboy" has no shortage of humor, interesting characters, and artistic choices - shades of "Pulp Fiction" and Tarantino's other films.  As such, "Oldboy" may be one of the more accessible films to those new to Asian cinema.  And it includes a psychopathic Stanford grad, to boot.<br /><br />I knocked off a star due to some pacing issues, and an ending that didn't quite fit with the rest of the film.  Without ruining the ending, it lasts too long, and where we should be racing for the curtain, there is overwrought melodrama and general wasting of time.  I thought this was over 10 minutes before it was.<br /><br />Nevertheless, fans of suspense, action and horror will enjoy this, as will fans of Asian cinema and people who are interested in Asian cinema.  "Oldboy" is worth at least a rent.</p></body></html>

Bad one-liners...<br /><br />To those who say "it's just supposed to be about nonsense", I respond, that even a film that is supposedly about nonsense needs to have structure and an engaging screenplay to succeed as a film. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory cannot hide behind its overweening fantastical settings; the screenwriter and director are LAAAAZY. Then again, Burton has never been strong on scripts -- look at his Batman films (plot holes ALL over the place) for some perfect examples. It blows me away that a man approaching 50, and a highly respected director, does not understand these things.</p></body></html>

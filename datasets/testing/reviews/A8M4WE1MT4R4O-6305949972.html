I love it so much i can't watch it all the time because i don't want to ruin it or wear it out.  It is a movie for adults actually.  They are the ones who can  truely appreciate it for what it is.  A genuine masterpiece of utter  perfection.  And the music?  What about the music?  It's really spooky and  cool!  <p>Watching Nightmare Before Christmas is like going on a really  cool ride at Disneyland.  It brings you into a fantastic world only equaled  while dreaming.  Thank you Tim Burton for creating this wonderful  movie!<p>Try watching the t.v show &quot;The P.Js&quot; if you like this  type of animation.</p></body></html>

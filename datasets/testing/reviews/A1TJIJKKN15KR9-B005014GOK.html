Easily the most morbidly hilarious film I've ever seen, I was cracking up at over-the-top triple decapitations within the first minute and shocked at the kind of material that was eliciting so many belly laughs. It's paper-thin by design, proudly heavy handed and clearly something everybody had the time of their lives filming, but the entertainment value does start to wane by the end of the second act. May have been more fulfilling as a joke trailer, though I'm sure I'll watch it again when I'm in the mood to shut off my brain.</p></body></html>

This is a captivating film from start to finish. It won this viewer immediately with the breath-taking cinematography of the Nevada desert landscape. Also highly appealing were the teenagers driving down a lonely Nevada road, with the radio on full blast playing an Elvis tune. They challenged the lead car of an Army convoy to a race, little did anyone realize what was soon to transpire. At the checkpoint, the convoy soldiers murder the guards. Russian soldiers and their leader infiltrated a secret storage facility hidden in the Nevada desert. There, Indiana Jones and a former British MI6 agent were prisoners, forced to locate a treasure they had discovered about 15 years ago ... It turns out, the Russian leader Dr. Irina Spalko (played exquisitely by Cate Blanchett) was a scientist who was involved in mind research and needed the Crystal Skull which was purported to have secret powers. I loved the ingenious technique by which Indy found the chest which contained a mummy from Peru with a disfigured skull. It verified something of great importance to the Russian scientist ...<br /><br />Next, Indy is interrogated by the CIA for his association with the British Agent who turns out to be a spy working for the Soviets. The CIA pressures Marshall College to fire Indy who instead is given a leave of absence based on a deal made by the President of the college with the Board. On leave, Dr. Henry Jones Jr (Indiana Jones) plans to teach in the UK where he has connections. On his way out of town, he is tracked down by a rebellious teenager named Mutt who has a personal letter from someone very well known to Indy, a UK archeaolgist who disappeared on an excavation in Peru. I loved the fight scene in the cafe which was deviously initiated by Mutt to allude the Soviet Agents. Mutt needs Indy's help to locate the missing professor and Mutt's mother, both of whom disappeared while on search of the Crystal Skull ...<br /><br />Indiana Jones and Mutt fly to Peru where they dig through the tombs of Spanish Conquistadors to locate clues. The Soviet soldiers and Dr. Irina Spalko are hot on their tails. Naturally, Indy and Mutt free the professor and Mutt's mother from their captors. The jungle chase scenes and the Amazon River escape with the two falls, were particularly enjoyable. High accolades and loud praise to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas who outdid themselves with a spectacular ending. The special effects and cinematography associated with the temple at Akator were inspirational. The ending was dynamic and jaw-dropping. This entire sequel was filled with superb creativity and amazing craftsmanship ...Erika Borsos [pepper flower]</p></body></html>

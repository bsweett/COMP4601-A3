<meta name="summary" content="Ever wish you could erase the memory of a failed romance?"></head><body><p>I was moved to write this review after perusing an online list of romantic movies (due to the approach of Valentine's Day) which included this film.  This movie was given the tag line: "Ever wish you could erase the memory of a failed romance?"  Unfortunately, the characters in this film surcome to such a temptation--with troubling results.  Jim Carry once again shows himself to be an excellent dramatic actor as he relives his volatile romance with his onetime kooky girlfriend played by Kat Winslet.  This movie also features winning performances by Kirsten Dunst as an unwittingly compromised employee of the memory erasing company, and Elijah Woods playing against type as a creepy opportunist.<br /><br />As a counterpoint to this movie, and its proof by contradiction regarding the importance of disfunctional relationships (and their recollection), the admirers of this film should read the poem by Guillaume Apollinaire "Le Pont Mirabeau" (The Mirabeau Bridge) and contemplate the fleeting nature of such an ephemeral romance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sequel is not as good as the first"></head><body><p>I saw the first movie and it was very terrifying. I was hoping to get the same effect from the second one and I was very disappointed. The writer was tied too much up into the stories of both parties, the victim and the buyer. I did watch the deleted scenes and there the director stated that he cut them because "it made the pace slow". Sorry, it didn't slow the pace, it explained the "dragging on of the story" that he was trying to accomplish. I don't want to make this a whine fest, but I also have some other complaints about the sequel. I don't have a problem with nudity. In fact I enjoy seeing nudity because it makes the characters more real, but the nudity should be equal between both sexes. In the deleted scenes the director stated that his "female hostel fans" protested to so much female nudity in the orginal. Yes, I do agree with them with this one. What should have happened is the director would have put in more male nudity. In the opening scene there is a male nude model for the art students. This was shown for about 2 seconds then the teachers head was put over the pelvic area of the models when she is walking. Then the director cut the scene of what the artist had painted. How lame is that? It most certainly looked like the director failed at what he was trying to do and "equalized" nothing. At least in the first movie there was more shots of men without shirts than this one. What I did like about the movie is that there were some "imaginative" ways that the "victims" were killed. There were also some very good twists in the story. I do recommend this movie to the "avid Hostel fans" but hopefully in the next one the director doesn't get "tied up in quickening the pace", make some of the "story" victims both male and female and leave out the "stories of the buyers".</p></body></html>

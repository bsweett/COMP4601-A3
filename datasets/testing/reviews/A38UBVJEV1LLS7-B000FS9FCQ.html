<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Adaptation"></head><body><p>Poor Alan Moore has been a tortured man for some time. Two of his graphic novels have been turned into what can only be called - crap. However, V for Vendetta does not suffer such a fate. There are some discrepancies, of course, but the film as a whole is highly successful and very entertaining.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is very well cast with loveable and hateable foils that make the film easy to follow. Portman is a joy as usual (not always). She is more than sufficient and brings much to her role as Evey. I was disappointed that they changed her profession (readers will catch my drift). However, the heart of her character is the same, and Portman does her finest, most touching work since Closer. V is well cast as well. I actually like the voice of Weaving coming from beneath that mocking mask, and his chemistry with Portman is remarkable considering that they are never actually face-to-face.<br /><br />The political aims (Bush etc.) in the film are fairly open, and can sometimes be distracting. However, as a whole the film is true to spirit of the novel. The air of revolution is thick with ideals and freedom, and one can actually see the people coming to life. I also think that the ending scenes are beautifully handled as the country transforms from a society of drones to one of individuals. I think that most anybody can enjoy this movie, if only for its incredible action and surprising sensitivity. Remember, remember this film forever.</p></body></html>

Yes, it was all rather surreal, but that quality was well-maintained throughout the movie and therefore seemed consistent and natural. The thrill of watching the fight scenes, which were obviously designed not to be a gorefest but a sophisticated, synchronized and deadly dance. I recommend this to anyone who likes to see a movie that is beautiful, stunning and also leaves the watcher with something to think about.</p></body></html>

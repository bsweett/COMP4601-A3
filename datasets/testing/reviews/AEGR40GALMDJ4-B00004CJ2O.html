<meta name="summary" content="This is quite the thrill ride."></head><body><p>A little different than Halloween and The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th is a new take on teen horror.  It isn't as good as its predecessors, but it is original and full of thrills and chills.  The villain is utterly unexpected.  Another thing that is neat is that you are constantly in shock over which of the campers is the main character, so you never know who will live and who will die.  The death scenes are inventive and not cheesy or stupid in any way.  This is a definate must see if you are into the horror genre.</p></body></html>

And I must say I was impressed.  Scorcese brings New York amazingly to life in the early 1860s' and during the escalating Civil War.  Driven by exquisite and extraordinary production and costume design, Scorcese drops you into New York and fills your eyes with color, filth and a good amount of blood.  The opening fight scene between the native and Dead Rabbits gangs is a raw, blood-soaked battle that brings to mind, surprisingly, the vicious hand-to-hand combat of "Braveheart."  A boy named Amsterdam witnesses the battle (Leonardo Decaprio, eventually) and his father slain at the hands of William Cutting (a superb Daniel-Day Lewis).  From then on, he is bent on revenge, wanting to kill Bill the Butcher, but make it convincing and a spectacle, the same way he killed his father.  <p>But a revenge-dominated plot has been done so many times in movies, but Scorcese has a trick up his sleeve.  The bulk of the movie focuses on the political corruption, lawlessness and turmoil of of the Five Points, Amsterdams' stomping grounds.  The Butcher has plenty of savvy here, and Day-Lewis hits every note right about him.  Day-Lewis creates a multi-layered, complex and unpredictable character from the moment he shows himself on screen.  Dicaprio stumbles at first with Amsterdam, but as the movie goes on, he becomes more confident, leading to the films' fiery and explosive climax when the Draft Riots insue.  Also, Cameron Diaz is effective as the pickpocket Jenny Everdean, but has the same problem that mirrors Dicaprio in her early troubles but eventual growth into her character.<p>Where the "If Flawed" part of my title comes from a script that is at times too ambitious and overreaching.  Where the screenwriters paint a vivid picture life and strife in the Five Points, they have difficulty developing characters other then Bill the Butcher and his cohorts.  Diaz was able to pull a respectable character of Jenny Everdean from a part that was often lacking.  There was the same problem with Amsterdam, though not as much.  They needed more text to describe Amsterdam in as much detail as they did Bill the Butcher.  Over the course of the movie though, the character of Amsterdam becomes clear, but not as readily or as satisfying as William Cutting.<p>Is "Gangs of New Yrok" Scorcese's best film?  Probably not, considering his past successes.  But it is a worthy entry in his repatuare, for its powerful vision of Civil-War era New York and Daniel Day-Lewis' deft and steady development of his big, bad William Cutting.  With repeat viewings, "Gangs" will reval itself more, showing more of its bravado and sinewy nature.</p></body></html>

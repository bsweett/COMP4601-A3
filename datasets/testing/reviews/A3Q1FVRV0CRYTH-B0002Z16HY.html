With its wonderful direction and effortless story telling `Downfall' delivers a tragic tale we don't all too often consider.  A lot of people have balked that this plays too much a sympathetic ear when considering the final days of Hitler's life, but it's that sympathy that we have yet to feel and so it's that key difference that stands this film apart from the rest as a landmark film in my eyes.<br /><br />Powered of course by Bruno's forceful performance (complete with subtle conversation, extreme outbursts, ticks and physical transformation...I mean really the whole package) as the hated leader of the Third Reich, `Downfall' focuses on those final days as Hitler's mental state worsened and the very thought of surrender and or hostile takeover drove him to suicide.  `Downfall' to me is less like `American History X' and more like `United 93' in that we never once get the feeling like we're being coerced into believing his prejudice (was it just me or did Edward Norton's character start to make his point after a while) but more or less are just given their viewpoint, as wrong as it may be, without sugar coating or biased conversion.  Hitler is painted as Hitler, nothing more and certainly nothing less.  What I appreciated was that instead of creating this undeniably horrid man we are just given facts and interpretation is left solely to the viewer.<br /><br />`Downfall' carries with it an epic feel and serves as a brilliant biopic upon all biopics.  With acting that surpasses most nominees that year; `Downfall' was sorely overlooked come the big race but deserves your consideration now.  Don't hesitate for fear you'll be shown a film bent of `humanizing' a monster, watch it for the sheer satisfaction that not all of Hollywood is bent on giving us stereotypes and thus they are willing to `humanize' him because as we should all know there is no such thing as monsters, just human-beings gone terribly wrong.</p></body></html>

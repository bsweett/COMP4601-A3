<meta name="summary" content="Loved it"></head><body><p>I dont know whats added onto the extended cut, but I still enjoyed it. Nicolas Cage doesnt seem to be a guy to play a super hero. Then again, neither does George Clooney. Did this movie stink like Batman and Robin? Hell no! He plays it well but its not the best performance. When he transforms in Ghost Rider, those are the best scenes. The movie is cheesy at points and the acting is a bit weak, but I loved the speical effects. I havent heard of a sequel, but I think it would be cool.</p></body></html>

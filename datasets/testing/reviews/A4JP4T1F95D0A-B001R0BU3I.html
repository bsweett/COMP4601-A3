Don Cheadle was fantastic and very believable in his role as a Sudanese/American Muslim.  This film is a real eye opener in how people can become fanatics and extremist.  It was also very interesting to see how a terrorist ring operates.  So besides being a nice little thriller, this film really makes you think.  Give it a try.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb Sci-Fi Thriller!"></head><body><p>Possibly one of the most successful and most entertaining science fiction movies ever made was "The Predator", filmed in the wilds of equatorial Mexico and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as an iron-jawed commando team commander brought in to extract diplomats out of the dense and exotic jungle in some small and un-named unfriendly Central American country. Dropped by stealthy helicopters behind the border, the team proceeds carefully in toward the target destination. Suddenly, the team, composed of action movie stalwarts like Carl Weathers and Jessie "The Body" Ventura (later to become the popular and unpredictable Governor of Minnesota) and a terrific supporting cast, discovers a wrecked attack helicopter and a platoon of US Army Rangers skinned alive and hung up in the trees. <p>From this moment on everyone knows something bizarre is going down. Once the switch is turned, the movie continually surprises the viewer by never settling for clich&eacute;, but choosing instead to mine old material in fresh and novel ways, building incredible suspense as everyone on the team begins to discover the deepening trouble they are in. Schwarzenegger does a wonderful job here, and his performance shows why he was so appealing in his prime. He is tough, cautious, and very thorough, and yet portrays the character as very human, vulnerable, and at times confused by the events so rapidly transpiring around him and this is not so easy to do for a six foot two, 230 pounds behemoth with a tough as nails image.<p>Yet this image is played with artfully here with clever one-liners and great gallows humor throughout the film, without ever becoming campy or predictable. Early on he recognizes something supernatural is afoot, and shows his willingness to suspend his ordinary judgements in favor of conceding to new possibilities, and it is this willingness to be open and eclectic that makes him such a formidable foe to the alien stalking them. The special effects for the alien are key here, and a lot of rework was done to make him as frightening and believable a character as possible. At first we just get glimpses of shadows and fading images, but eventually he begins to emerge and we se him in all his horrific heavy-metal glory. As Schwarzenegger remarks; this alien is one ugly _______-_______! <p>The resulting clash is a titanic dual that leaves us on the edges of our seats as the plot twists and turns as often as the bewildering tropical topography. The eventual mano-a-mano showdown between the alien and Schwarzenegger is an unbelievably well choreographed set of action sequences, and takes place over several encounters with a wild and unexpected plot twist or two. This is one everyone will love to have on their "A-List' for action flicks to take down on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Here is a movie sure to keep you laughing and still on the edge of your seat for hours. This one comes with both thumbs WAY UP! Enjoy!</p></body></html>

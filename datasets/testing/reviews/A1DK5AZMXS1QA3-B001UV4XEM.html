<meta name="summary" content="Funniest movie of 2009"></head><body><p>There are a lot of movies about bachelor parties, but this is probably the funniest.  Taking place in Las Vegas, this movie is about all the stuff that four guys can get themselves into when they are not thinking straight.  Yes there is nudity, but not what most would associate with a bachelor party.  Yes there is intoxication, but again not the type normally associated with a bachelor party.  Yes there are girls and gambling and gangsters all thrown in to make everything more interesting.  And there is one really mean pussy cat to top it off.  Overall, a great movie and by far the funniest of 2009.</p></body></html>

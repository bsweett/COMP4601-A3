<meta name="summary" content="Uninspired con-men film"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Matchstick Men might appeal more to people who haven't seen a lot of films about con men, but if you're familiar with the genre you'll find very little here to get excited about; though the characters are developed to the point where you care what happens to them at the end, the machinations of the screenplay are exceedingly familiar and contrived and prevent the story from earning entry into the upper echelon of the genre with Mamet's films and The Sting.<br /><br />2.5/4</p></body></html>

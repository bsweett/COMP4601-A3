<meta name="summary" content="Ok, but something is missing"></head><body><p>You can always expect certain things from a Terry Gilliam movie. When he has a budget as he did in this one, it will look beautiful, the story will be an odd one with some cool effects and sense of humor. These are all present in the Brothers Grimm, but the movie still doesn't completely work.<br /><br />The Grimm Brothers are con artists. They fleece money from villagers by setting up a myth about a witch or creature and then showing up to destroy said witch or monster. They are eventually captured by the French army and sent into the Thuringian forest to battle an actual ancient myth. The performances are good and it's a clever story but it just doesn't grab you. I was bored part way into it and never accummulated a great interest in how it would turn out.<br /><br />I think more humor might have helped. Also, the story didn't flow as well as it should have. Some scenes seemed just to be an excuse to show you some special effect they had thought up. The characters had little history and could have a used another dimension. This wasn't a bad movie, but something was missing.</p></body></html>

It's a pretty old movie.  I really didn't know if they could do much to improve the picture and sound quality of the movie.  Well, I thought wrong, for when I watched this movie, I was completely shocked and stunned.  I said to myself, &quot;I can't believe they made this movie better.&quot;<p>This has to be one of the best transfers I have ever seen.  The picture is ten times more crisper and sharper than the older DVD version.  When the terrorists shoot out the glass windows to trap Willis, you can literally see every single piece of glass landing on the floor.  Also, the sound is explosive and very impressive, especially if you can watch it in DTS.  When I watched this new version of &quot;Die Hard&quot;, it was like seeing it for the very first time.<p>If you are not familiar with &quot;Die Hard&quot;, here's the story:  Bruce Willis is John McClane, a very short tempered New York cop.  He goes to California, hoping to patch things up with his wife, who works at the Nakatomi Plaza.  All of that changes when a group of terrorists, armed to the teeth with guns and explosives, decide to take over the building.  Now, the only one who can stop them is McClane, and believe, he's not too thrilled with the idea, but he knows he's the only one who stands a chance against them.  McClane goes on a one-man war, running around the plaza, taking out the bad guys, and trying his best to stay alive.  As soon as he hears the first gun shot, McClane knows he's about to have a very bad day.<p>This is a must have for anyone who loves &quot;Die Hard&quot;.  I know some might be hesitant since they already have the first box set, but believe me, it is worth it.  Filled with non-stop action and thrills, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a classic, and should be seen by all who loves action films.  Again, I must say this is one of the best transfers I have ever seen.  An easy five out of five, without question.</p></body></html>

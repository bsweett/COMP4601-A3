What's happening of course, is old school mentality says a western has to make the bad guy as evil as possible so the audience has no pity for the bad guy when it's his time to be killed off.  "Tombstone" takes that to the most extreme I think I've seen in over a decade, but for as hard as they try, they just don't get the job done.  The producer and director are trying to give the audience a sense of the past misdeeds of the Clanton and the McClaury gang, using technique.  No sale, try something else in your next film, okay?  Kurt Russell helped direct this film and I guess this was just too early in his career to be experienced enough to know what works and what doesn't.<br />More and more, Hollywood makes justice and due process of the law to seem as equally evil and wrong as the criminal element.  Brutality for brutality, and yet done in a manner that portrays it isn't so much revenge as it is a reckoning.  The outlaw gang has an extended family adherence apparently, and the last quarter of the movie shows the marshal posse gunning them down like this movie was trying to beat a Bruce Willis movie for body count.  The story has for the most part ended before these events, and then has to go back to where the story left off.  Peppered into the stew is the poignant passing of Doc Holliday in a hospital bed in Colorado.  That sanatorium segment could have been left out entirely.  Seriously.<br />Well, Val Kilmer does a fair portrayal of Doc Holiday, although for all the sincere effort Kurt Russell puts into the role of Wyatt Earp, Kurt just isn't convincing.  Sam Elliott was throttled too far back.  This version of the events of the city by the movie's name, would have been a much better story if Sam Elliott had been cast in the lead.  Kurt Russell belongs in action, adventure, or sci-fi; but would be better off leaving westerns to other actors.  In those other genre, Kurt Russell has impressed me over and over again.  This time not so much.<br />I was surprised to see Charlton Heston in this movie in just a cameo role.<br />Michael Biehn does a great job in the role of Johnny Ringo; one of the bad guys.  His meeting at the big oak with Doc Holliday is the best part of this whole film.<br />I can't give this movie 5 stars.  My opinion is there was just something not quite right about this film, and I'm leaving historical accuracy out of it.  Something just wasn't kosher.<br />Most of the big names that should have been prominent were almost in obscurity by contrast.  Michelle Beauchamp only has about 4 minutes of screen time.  Billy Bob Thornton is a casino table dealer in a saloon.  Stephen Lang was great in "The Men Who Stare At Goats" and in "Gettysburg," but in this version of "Tombstone," his role as Ike Clanton is another one of those casting problems that simply doesn't work convincingly.  Dana Delany is lovely in her role as Josephine Marcus, but that sure could have been expanded upon.  BTW, the "R" rating is for violence, not for nudity or sexual situations.<br />Overall, this movie was much choppier than it had to be, and doesn't have the continuity to make it superior to "Wyatt Earp" with Kevin Costner.  Casting and emphasis in "Tombstone" is simply off the mark.  Should have been a lot better, the cast had enough talent; but apparently in the wrong place.  I'm glad I bought this DVD used.  May have to recycle this one for something better in trade.  Shouldn't be too hard to accomplish.</p></body></html>

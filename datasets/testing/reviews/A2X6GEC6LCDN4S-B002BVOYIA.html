<meta name="summary" content="Hotel Rwanda is Brilliant and So is Cheadle"></head><body><p>I would agree with this reviewer who says, "Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina as he really was during the ensuing chaos: "an expert in situational ethics" doing what he morally had to do, at great risk and potential sacrifice, with an understanding that wartime negotiations are largely a game of subterfuge, cooperation, and clever bribery."  The portrayal of America is not especially good.  The film makes it seem like the U.S. doesn't care about the tragedy because it is "not in their interest."  This may be an unfair shot.  It' almost like they are saying there is no oil or economic reason to fight, so let the black suckers die.  It may not be that simple as Hollywood makes it out to be....just a thought.<br /><br />Great acting, great picture, no doubt about it.</p></body></html>

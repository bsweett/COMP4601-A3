<meta name="summary" content="Still Arnie's Best"></head><body><p>This is a movie that confused me a bit as a child, but upon viewing it another time, I couldn't get enough of it. If you're an action fan, then this movie has everting. Great one-liners, car chases, fights, and murder and futuristic mayhem. In 1984, two men[Michael Biehn and Schwarzennegar] appear out of nowhere, both are from the future, and both have one goal, find Sarah Connor. This is Arnie's best role still to date, although he doesn't talk much. He starts out the movie with a bang, naked in kicking some street punk's asses, and stealing their clothes in the process. He proceeds to find as much ammo as possible, and track down Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. Hamilton delivers a good performance as a young woman frightened out of her wits. Director James Cameron does an excellent job putting the film together, and I found it hard to believe that this was only his second Hollywood film. Its a fun, suspenseful movie to watch!</p></body></html>

The temptation to make a 'different' movie sometimes leads them down wrong paths. Not so here. The followup feels very much cut from the same cloth of the first movie, but with more of a direct threat and momentum to the movie.<br /><br />In the first movie, the Goblin was bad, yes. But his actions had little to no pattern or goal to them (except disintegrating the board members of course). He was simply out to either hurt or turn Spider-man. It worked well enough for the movie, and since the Goblin was basically a man unhinged anyways. However, in comes Doc Oc.<br /><br />After a lab accident leaves him with four new appendages and the belief that Spider-man had ruined the attempt, he sets out to complete his life's work and rid himself of the one he blames his failure on. The fact is, if his experiment is completed, it could destroy the entire city, which gives real threat to the villain this time.<br /><br />The drama plays out well enough, but it's the action sequences you wait for. You are not disappointed on that front here. The fight sequences are intricate, large and fast-paced.<br /><br />In the end, it can be a matter of personal opinion as to which of the two movies you consider superior. For my part, my ballot is cast in favor of the 'sophomore success.'</p></body></html>

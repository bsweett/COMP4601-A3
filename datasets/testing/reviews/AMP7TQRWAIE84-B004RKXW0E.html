It leads me to believe that this movie might be more geared to a broader audience as opposed to mainly children. There are bright, funny and just darn cute sequences to be seen here but even more parts that will make you think, feel bad (yet invested) and just plain wanna see Andy's old chums make it through their stay at Sunnyside Daycare. In fact, I never expected this movie to take such a route.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I highly and thoroughly enjoyed this endeavor. Never have I seen a Pixar movie this great! This special! This elite! Some of the onlookers may be quite disappointed because the story gets dark. And when it's dark, it can seem grim. There are plenty times when it feels like there is no hope in sight. Just keep watching and stick it out. I got super-invested and you just might too. Toy Story 3 rocks to the umpth degree!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />4.5 stars (or a 9/10).<br /><br />P.S. The ending made me cry and I'm 26 and male. :^D</p></body></html>

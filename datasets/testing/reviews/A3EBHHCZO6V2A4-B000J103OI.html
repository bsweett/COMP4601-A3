It's a cinematic petit four, small, sweet, not to be taken too seriously. Anne Hathaway, proving she's as good at comedy as she is at pathos (check out her performance in "Brokeback Mountain" as Jake Gyllenhaal's hapless,heartbroken wife),stars as Andrea Sachs,a journalism graduate. Andrea (who goes by the androgynous "Andy") tries her luck at a fashion magazine. First, she encounters the bland, arrogant Emily (chunky Canadian crooner Michael Buble's real-life bland girlfriend Emily Blunt) It is awkward. Then she encounters Miranda Priestley herself (a radiant Meryl Streep)<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is an archetypal chick flick. Miranda sends Andy off on impossible tasks-such as delivering the rough draft of her magazine to her mansion, getting the right clothes, and so on. Since this is a materialistic movie, it's about Andy's transformation from ugly duckling to beautiful swan through high fashion. There are also product placements for Starbucks, Dean&Deluca, and the Harry Potter series (Miranda sends Andy to get the first copy of the seventh book) Andy's relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) gets strained,despite the fact he's in haute cuisine and makes "port reductions." You'd think haute couture and haute cuisine would complement and co-exist! Andy has a one-night stand with an improbably heterosexual fashion designer, Christian Thompson, who looks like he's gone to the plastic surgery one too many times. She also befriends the gay,flamboyant Nigel (Stanley Tucci) He confides in Andy of his childhood, saying that while his brothers played sports, he read fashion magazines. One wonders if Dr. Joseph Nicolosi would've said that going to a sports camp would've prevented Nigel's gayness. Swinging the bat makes boys straight!....well,maybe. The movie has a fairy tale ending- Andy reconciles with Nate, and she even gets a good recommendation from Miranda. Indeed, Miranda is less villainous than Emily. Emily is cold and conceited, while Miranda shows her vulnerable side when her marriage is breaking up. One feels sympathy for her. Miranda is a woman looking for redemption through fashion and power. She hasn't found what she's looking for.<br /><br />"Devil Wears Prada" has some good extras,such as "Fashion Visionary: Patricia Field" and "Finding Valentino." The "Fashion and NYC" is boring. I stopped it five minutes in. "Boss from Hell" and "Book to Movie" looked boringly self-referential.<br /><br />"Devil Wears Prada" is a fun fashion flick. If you like "Prada",you'll enjoy ABC's campy ode to fashion, "Ugly Betty."</p></body></html>

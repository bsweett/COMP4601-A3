<meta name="summary" content="What an Amazing Woman"></head><body><p>Wow!  This is not another Pretty Woman by any means.  Julia's character is a struggling mother who has no question in her mind as to the right and wrong of a whole town's situation, and she isn't afraid to hunt down the evidence and the answers she needs. Erin Brockovich is based on the true story of a woman at the end of her means who is scratching and clawing to keep from drowning while supporting her children, and saving a town.  Roberts does an exceptional job portraying Brockovich.<p>Kudos to both Julia for a job well done, and Erin for making her life what she wanted it to be, while helping those who couldn't have done it on their own.</p></body></html>

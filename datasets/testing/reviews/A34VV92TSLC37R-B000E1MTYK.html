<meta name="summary" content="About as good as you could expect"></head><body><p>After finishing the novel, I was extremely excited to see the film version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I was very happy with the result as I left the theater.  There was just so much that happened in the book that could not be fit into a movie that wasn't 3 hours plus long.  The movie is 2 and a half hours long as it is, and that is with it missing a lot of stuff that happens in the novel.<br /><br />The biggest missing pieces is the presence of the house-elves.  Winky and Dobby play an extremely important role in the novel, yet they do not appear at all in the film.  In fact, the group that Hermione creates, S.P.E.W., is never mentioned in the film, either.  I personally really enjoy the presence of house-elves in the novels, although I could see how some people find them annoying.  It just seems like there could have been a middle ground, and then they wouldn't have to be written completely out of the movie.<br /><br />I guess the down side to trying to make movies out of a book like Goblet of Fire or Lord of the Rings is that so many HUGE things happen, that it is really tough to develop any characters other than the main, ultra-important hero/villain/sidekicks.  Specifically, the absence of any story whatsoever about Fred and George is a little disappointing.  Their constant disobedience and troublemaking in the novels is a welcome aside from the foreboding nature of the rest of the novel, and I think the twins are also a little underutilized in the movie, and they are turned into that classic movie-twin cliche of whenever they are onscreen, they are basically just there to say something together (like all twins do all the time).  Since this film focuses more on the big picture of Harry vs. Voldemort, the characters of Draco and Snape are also pretty much absent for most of the film.  I think Snape only has four or five speaking scenes, and you just don't get the vibe of hatred and enmity between Harry and Snape that you get from the novels.  Draco is also limited to very few lines.  His most important scene is probaby my favorite scene from any of the books so far, and that is when Mad-Eye Moody turns him into a ferret, thankfully that scene is in the film in its entirety.  In the book, though, Draco was there during almost every important scene that involved Hogwart's.  He made Harry's life miserable during the tournament, and the film doesn't really give you that impression at all.  The only bad thing that comes from Harry's entrance into the tournament is a fight with Ron, that is drastically cut short also.<br /><br />So I guess I've only said critical things so far, but I gave it four stars, so I better back myself up.  The visuals in this film are absolutely amazing.  Reading the books, you just can't help but think "man, I can't wait to see that dragon on the big screen," and the dragon scene is amazing, though the filmmakers did take quite a few liberties with it to draw it out a little more and make it a little more "blockbuster action sequence" than the book gave us.  Both of the other schools  that compete in the tournament look great.  I thought the filmmakers were spot on with their representation of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes finally gets to really appear, and it was amazing.  I don't think that there was a better choice out there for Lord Voldemort.  That's why I was a little disappointed that his speech in the graveyard didn't go as long as it did in the book, but what we do get from him is amazing, and I can't wait for more.  I think if I was 10 years old, and I saw this movie, I would have nightmares for a while.  Voldemort is that creepy.  Everything that I hoped for.<br /><br />Something also needs to be said for Daniel Radcliffe.  I think he's done a great job, but I also feel a little bad for him.  I feel bad because I think he really is a good actor, but he will always be known as Harry Potter, and it will be really tough to watch him act in another role and be convincing.  But I'm glad that Harry's character is in as good of hands as it is with Radcliffe.<br /><br />Overall, the film was great.  Yeah, a lot of stuff wasn't included that I would have liked, but overall, the studio is out to make money off of these movies, and it's tough to market a movie that is over 3 hours long.  Although I hope that they go at least 3 hours with Order of the Phoenix.  Harry Potter fans are die hard enough, that we will sit through any length of movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sunday Morning Coming Down"></head><body><p>Okay, it's Sunday morning and Sandra Bullock suggests that Julian McMahon take the two little girls out for some Sunday fun, while she makes an emergency Sunday morning visit to her local Catholic Church.  Am I crazy or what?  When she gets to the church, it's completely deserted except for the kindly parish priest who tells her, "Haven't seen you for a while."  He has plenty of time to sit her down and tell her historical stories from his research into premonition.  Why didn't the Church have a few parishioners in it--why wasn't the priest saying Mass?  Maybe I had the day wrong, but I tore out a piece of shelf paper and scribbled a rough calendar with magic markers, every time I learned of a new terror for Sandra Bullock I wrote down what date it happened on, and my calendar as well as the screenplay, will swear in court it was Sunday morning.<br /><br />I know it was before the older little girl flew through the glsss doors and cuts blossomed over her innocent, sulky face.  I think she was expressing the pain of her mom and dad's dissolving marriage.  After THE LAKE HOUSE and CRASH, we all wanted Sandra Bullock to smile again, but this time around she's gone off the deep end into ceaseless, unyielding depression.  Her mouth is pinched, her forehead a giant frown.  her hair is limp, lifeless, and jumps around her head like the strings of a whisk broom.  She's brave, my wife said to me, for she shares a few scenes with former supermodel Amber Valletta, who's lost none of her oomph over the years, and the whole audience is figuring, of course he's going to that motel with Amber Valletta, why put up with Sandra Bullock's frowns and complaints a day longer.<br /><br />We learn from the priest that it's all about spiritual emptiness.  I think that perhaps the director, Mennon Yappo, was inspired by some of the late Ingmar Bergman's mid-period films like SHAME and THE PASSION OF ANNA and decided that, in Sandra Bullock, he had located the Liv Ullmann of our modern times, so he asked her to look glum, bought that fake bloody blackbird, got Kate Nelligan out of retirement, and hoped for the best.  In my humble opinion it's better than anything Bergman did, though let him rest in peace, in his Lutheran coffin of a churchyard.</p></body></html>

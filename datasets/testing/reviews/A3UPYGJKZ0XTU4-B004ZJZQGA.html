<meta name="summary" content="A Surprisingly Fresh and Darkly Funny Hit Man Movie."></head><body><p>I've seen a lot of hit man movies but none quite like "In Bruges", which combines black comedy and high drama to surprisingly fresh effect. Not only is it genuinely funny, but it's original. I haven't seen these characters countless times before. Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are a couple of Irish hit men sent to Bruges, Brussels to lie low after Ray accidentally killed a child on a job in London. Ken is able to relax and enjoy the sightseeing in the picturesque city while they await instructions from their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). But Ray is nervous, disinterested, and guilt-ridden -until he meets Chloe (Clemence Poesy), a woman working on a Belgian film crew who isn't put off by Ray's obnoxious behavior.<br /><br />Martin McDonagh wrote and directed "In Bruges", his first feature film, and I'll be looking out for him in the future. He writes peculiar, politically incorrect dialogue that is both hilarious and unexpected. And I was amazed by this film's ability to make unrespectable characters so likable. Ray is an uneducated bigot, cute, but nevertheless grating. Yet his interplay with the older and wiser Ken is fascinating and leaves the audience routing for him. Harry Waters is single-minded killer, but he is so steadfast in his own bizarre value system that he's almost sympathetic. These men's rather serious problems ultimately had me laughing out loud. Ironically, I found the violence had more impact than in most gangster films, though I'm not sure if that is due to, or in spite of, the humor.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008): Bonus features include some Deleted & Extended scenes, a Gag Reel (6 min), and 4 featurettes. "When in Bruges" (14 min) interviews writer/director Martin McDonagh, the cast, and producer Graham Broadbent about the genesis of the story, characters, and themes. "Strange Bruges" (7 ? min) talks with director, cast, and production designer Michael Carlin about the city as environment and filming there. "A Boat Trip Around Bruges" (6 min) is literally a boat tour of the city, by canal, with the history of the city displaying as text across the top and bottom of the screen. "Fooking Bruges" (1 ? min) is a montage of all the F-words in the movie, which I count to be over 100. Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

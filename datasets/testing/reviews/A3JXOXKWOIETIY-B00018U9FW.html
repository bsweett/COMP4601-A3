<meta name="summary" content="JACK BLACK ATTACK APPEASES THE GOD OF ROCK!!"></head><body><p>Penned by Mike White, Directed by Rick Linklater and starring the Jack Black Attack, (the) School of Rock is a successful combo of hilarity, rebellion, and rock'n'ruuuwwwwlll!<br />  From Jack Black's 200-pound-ball-of-pain belly dive at the opening to that at the end, from Sunshine of Your Love to The Immigrant Song, SOR takes Spinal Tap to the next level (12).  Black plays a rock'n'roller who gets a job subbing for the country's top grammer school by pretending he's Ned Shneeebly (sic).  He takes over the class and teaches them the ABCs of Rock.  The talented kids are all great as they learn the lesson well of how to stick it to the man.<br /><br />  And behind all the humor there's a serious message.  Rock'n'Roll explodes at a time of societal rightwing oppression.  Rock has been the way for half a century, the way to tell the man to "step off".  Whether "the man" is oppressive parents, teachers, or other disciplinarians who rule our oppressive society.  But there are some cracks in that oppression and that's where rock comes in.  So turn on this 5 star movie and LET'S GET ROCKIN'!  Ahh-aaahh-aaaaaaah-AAAAHH.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They made a whole new version cause they think they found out al little more about his origin?  Well it's a reason to make this"></head><body><p>I guess that's a reason.<br /><br />But I would give it a 3.5.<br /><br />I feel very strongly about this movie, so let me just lay out to you what I liked and what I didn't.<br /><br />WHAT i DID LIKE:<br /><br />THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!, the storyline, the costumes, the action was pretty good, boz, the chubby long hair guy.  All of these elements are very good, then the movie misfires on many things also.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: THE ACTING, oh my god, this has to be the director's fault here.  he has great actors, but it is the way you direct them to act.  The two main guy characters were just godawful, yet  you could tell they were good actors, they were just being told what to do wrongly.  I can't say that anyone was as glaring as these guys, but it is amazing how they stand out as being the leads and all, yet the supporting actors are really leaving you with the feeling of wanting to know more about them.<br /><br />So once again, not the greatest battle sequences, but then again that is when most of the actors shined through the most.<br /><br />So the retelling was done in an awfully quick manner, but it is still a pretty cool looking movie at least.<br /><br />Also i have the directors cut and haven't seen the regular version, but this one is certainly worth a watch.  And the commentary sucks, but the trivia track is pretty good.  Also the special features include like 40 minutes of making of and thoughts of, that kind of stuff, once again that feature beat the hell out of the commentary.  And there is a deleted scene or two.</p></body></html>

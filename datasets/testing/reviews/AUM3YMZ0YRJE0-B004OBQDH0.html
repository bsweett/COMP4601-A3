While the HB Prince and Order P were a bit of a blur, this film is completely distinctive - it doesn't take place in HogW and is a running adventure chase in full, with many principal characters killed off.  It moves much faster, the dangers seem far greater, and everything is at stake.  This is even character development, with Ron rebelling and coming back, the progress of young love, and Harry's flaws coming out more clearly.  After so much time, it amazes me that the quality is still going up.  The comic touches, depth of theme, and fine acting continue, of course.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

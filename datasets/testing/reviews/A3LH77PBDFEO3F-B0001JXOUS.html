It is story about regaining self respect. Everyone deals with demons in their past, if you would like to see a film that is exceptionally well acted, and beautifully filmed set in 19th century Japan, that deals with overcoming past mistakes this is  a film you will love. If you do, you will really love the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0886778697">The Faded Sun Trilogy: Kesrith, Shon'jir, and Kutath</a> by C J Cherryh. A more in depth study of the same issue.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not a mind-blowing sci-fi experience, mind you, but..."></head><body><p>...I still enjoyed the hell out of it anyway.<br /><br />First - let's get a major (or not considering how often this is covered in movie reviews) spoiler out of the way.  This is NOT an Alien movie.<br /><br />It is, however, set in the same universe.  Do you recall the ship on LV426 in the first Alien movie discovered by the ill-fated crew of the Nostromo?  Ever wonder who the other aliens were, the ones who originally piloted the craft which included the well-preserved remains of a giant humanoid featuring a chest wound that only foreshadowed what was to come?<br /><br />Ridley Scott answers those questions.  You may not like the answers, but the answers that Ridley Scott does provide are plausible and yet raise more questions at the same time.  Where did humanity come from?  Did we originate from elsewhere?  Does life exist elsewhere?  Do ancient sigils hail from somewhere else?  Two archaelogists would love to find out although their opinions differ from the scientific on one end and from faith on the other.<br /><br />Ridley Scott doesn't usually make the same movie twice and if you're expecting a Blade Runner or Alien out of Prometheus, you will be sorely disappointed.  Prometheus (unlike the Nostromo) is lavishly appointed by its funder, Mr. Weyland, and features state-of-the-art navigation and equipment unlike the funded-for-blue-collar-workers' ship, the Nostromo.  Our crew is also well-equipped to map out the areas, although they do take questionable risks at times.<br /><br />Even so, what they encounter ultimately will change the origins of the Alien mythos and their intended purpose may not be as far off from the vision that Weyland-Yutani had in mind for them later on in the franchise.<br /><br />Yes, you'll read in some of the reviews that some characters are cardboard cutouts, some lines are cliched, and it is also not a game-changer in the sci-fi genre, but what Ridley Scott still manages to accomplish is an enormous sense of scale in both his world creation, environments, and scope of story.<br /><br />This movie certainly invites additional outings to be sure and with additional questions to be answered, I hope that he's on board to continue the ride.</p></body></html>

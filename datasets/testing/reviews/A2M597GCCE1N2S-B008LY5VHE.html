<meta name="summary" content="I wonder if people can still go into the water after watching this movie?"></head><body><p>Jaws is one of those instant classics that affect anyone who watches it in any new generation. Just watch, 20 years from now people are going to be just as scared as they were 31 years ago. The movie is what TRUE horror movies are, with the Alfred Hitchcock style of not really seeing the blood and gore during most of the movie, as well as terror and suspense at an all time high.<br /><br />When a young woman's remains wash up on a beach by a Long Island town named Amity, the only person who suspects something more sinister than a boating accident is the chief of police [played by Roy Scheider. He thinks it was a shark, and the only person who believes him is a shark expert [played by Richard Dreyfuss]who concludes that it is a Great White who is responsible.<br /><br />Instead of listening to the warnings to shut the beaches down, the mayor of the town continues to hold them open. After all, the next day is the Fourth of July, and they really can't shut the beaches down on the biggest tourist attraction event of the year can they?<br /><br />So the beaches remain open and the worst happens. A young boy is attacked by a shark and killed. After several decisions and arguments on what to do, the one thing agreed on is that an expedition needs to hunt the shark down and kill it. In enters an old mariner named Quint [played by Robert Shaw] who leads the Sheriff and Shark Specialist in a hunt for the shark to kill it.<br /><br />The sequence on the boat during the second half of the movie is worth the price of the DVD alone. The three men realize that the shark is hunting them, instead of the other way around. Despite shooting at it, harpooning it, and even trying to drag it home, what happens in the end is what made people respect horror films for what real movie making is.<br /><br />As far as this "Speical Edition" goes, you're better off buying the normal DVD set because you're not missing much. A second disk with a 2 hour making of documentary is the same as countless TV specials I've seen over the years. Also the only thing worth checking out is the 40 page commemorative photo journal of the movie and the documentary.<br /><br />Besides that, if you havent seen the movie you have no idea what you are missing. Just be sure to go on that beach trip BEFORE watching the film, trust me...</p></body></html>

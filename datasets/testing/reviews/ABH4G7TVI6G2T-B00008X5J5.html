<meta name="summary" content="a "Once Upon a Dream" experience"></head><body><p>In 1987, as a wide-eyed 6-year-old, I saw SLEEPING BEAUTY during it's cinema re-release.  It was probably the first time I ever went to the movies.  The experience definitely stayed with me and fired my love of Disney movies which had begun when I was a toddler with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and MARY POPPINS on video.  Now so many years later I have relished collecting and revisiting all the Disney classics on DVD, and the 2-disc edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is something really special.  Six years in the making, the movie made history for being the first animated feature shot in 70mm and was the 2nd highest-grossing film of the 1960s' (second only to BEN-HUR).<br /><br />The story is well-known: Beautiful Princess Aurora is cursed as a baby by the cruel Maleficent.  On her 16th birthday she'll die from pricking her finger on a spindle.  Good fairy Merryweather remedies the curse by changing death to sleep, and the awakening of Aurora by the kiss of true love.  However, to ensure that Aurora does not meet this fate at all, the fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather take the infant deep into the forest, where they pose as three spinsters and rename the child Briar Rose.  On her 16th birthday the girl will be quietly smuggled back to the palace with Maleficent none-the-wiser.  However things take an unexpected turn when Briar Rose falls in love with a handsome Prince, and the princess is ultimately discovered despite the best efforts of the fairies'.<br /><br />The production design by Eyvind Earl takes it's cue from medieval tapestries and paintings.  The score, freely-adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet, is lush with "Once Upon a Dream" and "I Wonder" the main standouts.  Mary Costa, later one of the leading opera singers of the 60s' and 70s', performs the role of Aurora/Briar Rose and does a fantastic job.  The character of Prince Phillip (voiced by Bill Shirley) is the first prince in a Disney fairytale that takes an active role in the story.  The prince-roles in SNOW WHITE and CINDERELLA are quite static and uninteresting.  Eleanor Audley (who also memorably voiced CINDERELLA's icy stepmother Lady Tremaine) works her magic again with Maleficent, still one of Disney's strongest villains.  Verna Felton, Vera Vague and Barbara Luddy play Flora, Fauna and Merryweather.  Disney fans will remember Felton from CINDERELLA (the Fairy Godmother), ALICE IN WONDERLAND (the Queen of Hearts) and LADY AND THE TRAMP (Aunt Sarah).  Barbara Luddy's voice you'll also remember as that of Lady in LADY AND THE TRAMP.<br /><br />Disney has done a terrific job in restoring SLEEPING BEAUTY for this 2-disc Special Edition.  The film is presented in its  Technirama 70mm proportions with 5.1 sound mix (as well as an optional DTS mix).  The colours are strong and vibrant with the use of High Definition Video employed to clean up every frame of animation.  Some great extras are included, featuring a 'Making Of' segment with Mary Costa and Eyvind Earl both extensively interviewed.  There's also a recreation of the original Disneyland 'Sleeping Beauty Walk-Through attraction' which features early concept art by Earl.  The lovely Disney cinema featurette THE PETER TCHAIKOVSKY STORY is also included along with a cute set-top adventure game 'Rescue Aurora', plus lots more.</p></body></html>

He's great in that, but now that I've seen him in DEAD SILENCE, I can only surmise that on TRUEBLOOD, it's his buttocks that do all his acting for him, and they should be awarded the Emmy for the superlative work he puts them through on that show.  Here they are continually hidden underneath an unsavory pair of jeans, and thus poor Ryan has literally nothing to work with.  In a way this acting theory matches the premise of DEAD SILENCE, a film that asks us to believe that an entire town, Raven's Fair, has only a few residents in it, and all of them are controlled by the vengeful spirit of Mary Shaw, an amateur ventriloquist of the early 1950s who loved both children and dolls until one snippy little rich boy spoiled her show by exclaiming loudly that he could see her lips moving.<br /><br />In consequence everything starts going wrong for both Mary Shaw and everyone she knows.<br /><br />The film suffers from an extremely low budget.  They could only afford to hire about four actors, to represent not only the populace of the godforsaken town, but also the entire population of NYC.  They could only afford three colors also, so everything is drenched in deep blue, except when Jamie gets into a red car or a horrible ghost tears out red tongues from people's mouths.  And there's black as the third color, but how cheap can you get?  But they really could have saved money, as well as improving the film about 1,000 per cent, by leaving the pants off Ryan Kwanten and his unforgettable assets.  Oh what a waste.</p></body></html>

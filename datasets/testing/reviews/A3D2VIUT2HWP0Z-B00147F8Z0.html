<meta name="summary" content="REQUIEM for the Living"></head><body><p>First and foremost, I hope this franchise continues. I saw the theatrical cut and I enjoyed it, and this unrated version again proves that the unrated version continues to be the gold standard in movies.REQUIEM has a very good story, and the unrated places more of the theatrical version in context, and whats more fun is we get to see more of the predator's tool kit and his/her/its pack of goodies. Whilst the directors clearly have a favorite version of the predator and Aliens ( more relevant in the case of the Alien with 4 if not more directors putting there thoughts in the canon of the Aliens Quadrilogy). Viewers of the Theatrical version will not appreciate just how much has been put back in, or redone until they see the film, and hear the directors and producer commentary.This is truly a film for the fans, but I think if you love a bit of Horror and Sci-fi mixed, you should still enjoy it.<br />And if you can't see this film, either get glasses, or fumble for the contrast controls on the TV... the Unrated version is well shot and is in tone with what the Directors wanted. The lights are light and the darks are dark... thats the way this movie was done. I suspect that part of the reason that the creature sequences are allegedly darker is that they are attempting to stop revealing too much, since the creatures are in full frame.<br />THE DVD:<br />The Commentaries are the best element. The Directors and  the producer give the best information, however, if you want something entertaining and informative, Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff satisfy.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

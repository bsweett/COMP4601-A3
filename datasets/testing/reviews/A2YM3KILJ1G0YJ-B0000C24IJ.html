Soon thereafter, a young doctor named Chris rams their car.  The six are stranded on a seemingly abandoned dirt road; however, they just happen to be trespassing.<br /><br />The six interlopers are on the ol' Johnson land.  Brothers Bubba (nicknamed Three Finger, he's the young one who likes to climb trees and laugh), Cletus (nicknamed Saw-Tooth, he's the middle one who's fond of archery), and big brother Bobby Ray (nicknamed One-Eye, he's the brain of the family who likes canning and preserving) soon see the six outsiders, and become rightfully enraged.  Forced to fend for themselves from a young age - their parents dying young as a result of "bad genetics" - the three brothers were left with no other kin to help with cookin', cleanin', and learnin'.  As a result of this harsh upbringing, and the fact that not one is smarter than the average chimp, they manage however they can, following in their family's traditions of inbreeding and cannibalism.  Knowing only what they have picked up through trial and error, the brothers decide to not only defend their land, but also pick up lunch in the process.<br /><br />The rest is predictable of most slasher flicks.  The women drop clothes, get wet, and scream a lot.  The men do heroically stupid things.  Blood flies, and all the right people die miserable deaths.  Incredible tension and struggle takes place, especially a great battle in the forest ceiling, as the three brothers defend their home valiantly, but ultimately unsuccessfully.  In the end it's a heart-warming story of three misunderstood brothers who just happen to enjoy dismemberment and the taste of human flesh.<br /><br />With great production value, believable gore, beautiful people like Eliza Dushku throughout, a hilarious cackle from Bubba, and a few great surprises, even those who don't appreciate the horror genre should like this one.</p></body></html>

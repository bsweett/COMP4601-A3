<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Above Average Revenge Story: Western Reinvented For Modern Detroit"></head><body><p>Though set in modern-day Detroit, `Four Brothers' goes like old-fashioned Western film. First you witness one violent death, which causes the four tough guys get together again, in the town where they were raised as bad boys, and in the name of justice they begin their own fight against crimes. The vendetta story is told with John Singleton's rather inconsistent storytelling, mixing sentimental moments, violent actions, and not-so-sophisticated humors. Don't expect too much from the rambling storyline and some of the formulaic set-pieces (from the writer team David Elliot and Paul Lovett). But the film remains engaging throughout thanks to the portraits of 'Four Brothers.'<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund are the `Four Brothers' who search the truths behind the killings by the two masked guys at the grocery store because the victims included their `Mother' Evelyn (Fionnula Flanagan). But who is really responsible for the death of their foster parent? The script gives some hints early on (in fact, there's a fairly big hint in the opening credits) so the film's point is not a whodunit. It's about the brotherhood of the four guys, which is severely tested by the bullets and blood.<br /><br />I don't say the acting of the four actors is exceptional, but still they are good and believable. I am not still sure of Wahlberg's acting capacity, and his acting here didn't change my mind about that, but he is OK. Andre Benjamin shows surprisingly good acting after his comic turn in `Be Cool,' but it is Terrence Howard who adds precious tone of subtlety as Lt. Green and though briefly, the appearance of Flanagan gives humane touch to the otherwise generic story. Compared with the males, young females are given less attention from director, and Singleton shows almost no interest in developing the character of Sofi, speaking Spanish, hot-tempered, etc. played by Sofia Vergara.<br /><br />But after all we don't see Westerns for females, and maybe Singleton should not be blamed. It is certain that `Four Brothers' gives what it promises in its title - four guys avenging the beloved one's death. The Good vs. the Bad, or Justice with Violence. In this film, they are done not in the wild West, but in the frosty streets of cold Detroit (with Motown music). You either like or hate the film for the same reasons. I didn't hate it, but must say that I am not a big fan of Singleton's uneven narrative style. Still, four stars for four brothers.</p></body></html>

This is the one where we find out that supernatural menace, Michael Myers is the brother of Laurie Strode(Jamie Leigh Curtis)<p>But the ending leaves  a lot to be desired as both Donald Pleasence and Myers are supposedly blown  up in an explosion in the hospital, thus leaving us thinking both of them  are dead.<p>But it will take a few more Halloween nights before Michael  gets his comeuppance.</p></body></html>

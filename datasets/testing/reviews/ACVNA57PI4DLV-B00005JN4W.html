<meta name="summary" content="Pixar has out-done itself !"></head><body><p>Wow ! What an incredible animation movie from Pixar. It is just full of wit, superb settings and animation, an eye for detail, and works at all levels. Most of the humour in The Incredibles lampoons the "superhero" concept and how it would translate in real life, with the constraints of daily life, aging, social interactions, and so on. It also sends up spy movies almost as extensively. There is a sequence where Mr. Incredible distracts guards by throwing a giant rock at one of them, which is just precious.<br /><br />If there is one thing wrong with The Incredibles, you could say it is the ideological underpinning. Basically, the movie takes a positive attitude towards the idea that the Incredibles are "special people" and that trying to reproduce their powers through technology and giving them to the masses is evil. It's hard not to make an analogy with gun control and elitism of the worst kind, much like what has been leveled against Star Wars from some quarters.<br /><br />In the end, though, it becomes pretty irrelevant in the top-notch and inspired visuals, the jokes that almost always strike true, and just the wealth of ideas in there. Everything rings true. The only movie comparable to it is The Iron Giant, made by the same director. Now if only we could get more animation like this...</p></body></html>

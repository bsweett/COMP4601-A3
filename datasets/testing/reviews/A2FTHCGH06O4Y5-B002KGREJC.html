<meta name="summary" content="great elements don't cohere"></head><body><p>This movie can boast some great elements, but it seems like they don't belong together in the same movie.  There's some simple but upbeat music, but none of it belongs in a movie riven by gut-wrenching crises.  There's many snappy lines by the lead, Ellen Page, but none of them seem to fit the moment in the movie (e.g., like I'm so sure that when admitting what's happened to her parents -- who up to this point aren't even aware that she's "sexually active" -- she'd be quipping that Bleeker had been so "good in chair.")  That just didn't strike me as reality.<br /><br />So heck.  If you take away the snappy dialogue and the fun movie, you're left with quite the forgettable script.  And I don't wanna hear people saying that Ellen Page is a great actress:  this role was totally easy!  She never had to invest in it, so to speak.  The only scene in which she really had to lay it ont he line was the crying scene in the car.  Big whup. The rest of the scenes she plays in a monotonously even tone that ends up nearly sabotaging the script:  because of her, there's no character arc to Juno!<br /><br />As for that guy who wants to play his guitar and live in a loft apartment!  You go!  Your t-shirt is awesome!  Forget that woman!  The world has enough babies.  What we need is more artists and dreamers.</p></body></html>

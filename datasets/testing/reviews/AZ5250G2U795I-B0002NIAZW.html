<meta name="summary" content="Save yourself...and your $$$.  Don't buy...rent if you must!"></head><body><p>OK...First of all, I know that this hasn't been released yet...so if you are shopping around here for pre-release....for the love of all that's good don't buy 'Day After Tomorrow.'  It's a film that was decidedly rushed into theaters (REALLY shows in some of the special effects that fall flat), relied more on special effects than story, and really wastes talent of otherwise good actors.<br /><br />First of all, let me tell you...if you thought Titanic was good when it was in theaters...then rented it and scratched your head going 'Wha?'...I can almost guarantee the same effect with 'DAT'.  It relies so much on special effects that, once that 'wow' is taken out (which the smaller screens inevitably do to heavily Special-effects flicks), you are left with story.  If that falls flat (and BOY does this one!), you have a DVD that will collect dust because you will never watch it, until you can resell it at a heavily discounted price than from what you bought it!<br /><br />In a nutshell...here's the story:  Global warming has wreaked havoc, and an ice age decends on the northern hemisphere...oh..in about 3 days!  What normally took decades/centuries to happen...the script writers would have us believe happens in a few short days.  Giant hail, inexplicable snowstorms in India, tornados in LA (One of the really cool effects...which lasts about a minute)...everything is going haywire, meteorogically, and we have our empassioned scientist, played by Dennis Quaid, who warned this would happen.  Oh...and for some reason, he decides to don snowshoes and walk to save his son who is stranded in NY:  He's in Philadelphia!!!  This walk presumably takes place over a few hour period.  (I'm NOT kidding).  Jake Gylennhal muddles through his performance with as much enthusiasm as warm milk.  It's like he signed on, THEN got the script...or realized how dreadfully the CGI wolves would look. (trust me...they are Ed Woodian in terms of how poorly this effect is executed!)<br /><br />Bad Story....scant special effects that are doomed to fail on the smaller screens of home theater.  Please...save yourselves and click over to Spiderman 2, a Far superior movie and one with the story to overcome small screen from big screen translation.  There is absolutely NOTHING to see about Day After Tomorrow!</p></body></html>

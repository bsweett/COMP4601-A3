<meta name="summary" content="An Intriguing and Impressive Sequel"></head><body><p>Iron Man 2 is another sequel to a comic book action film that works, and may even exceed the quality of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAPC1K">its predecessor</a>.  It is a sequel to 2008's Iron Man and other than James Rhodes (who was portrayed by Terrence Howard in the first film but is now played by Don Cheadle) the cast has returned.  It is hard to rave about a movie that is for the most part a simple sequel that isn't a huge improvement on the original, but on the other hand the first film was so good it's important to include Iron Man 2 as among the best comic book films to be made so far within a relatively newer sub-genre in its renaissance.  Jon Favreau directs and once again walks a fine line between serious drama and kitsch with great success.  He has to be one of the brightest filmmakers doing pure Hollywood blockbusters today.  He's a filmmaker doing what he wants and having fun with it, but making the suits very happy.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 brings the arrogant drunk arms dealer Tony Stark, whose just charming enough to like, back but under the scrutiny of  Senator Stern (played by Gary Shandling) for withholding a serious weapon; himself.  Stark is human enough to work on screen and it makes it all the more intriguing when we see a flawed personality like him make good decisions.  He is a greater hero than most casual comic book readers give him credit for and it is nice to see this franchise get this kind of outstanding treatment.  Tony's Iron Man technology is something that Stern feels could get into the wrong hands and used against the United States, but Stark quickly demonstrates that this just isn't the case. Of course the film's most notable baddie demonstrates otherwise when he shows up and attacks Iron Man himself.  He is Ivan Vanko, a maniacal super genius physicist who has harnessed some of Stark's technology to create giant appendages that can cut cars in half.  In the spirit of the comics Vanko is aesthetically an interpretation of the more obscure Whiplash and that is his name, but he is essentially The Crimson Dynamo as I remember him, and Ivan's father (a rival of Stark's father) even bears the classic villain's real name, Anton.  Either way it is a fantastic hybrid and with Mickey Rourke at his absolute best Iron Man 2 has a villain more than worthy of top praise.  Whiplash is awesome and I was openly cheering for him the whole time.  He is funded by naive and clumsy Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell) who is really the archetype rich boy villain.  He's like one of those rich guys on those horrific reality shows that everyone hates with blind passion.  He is Tony Stark without the witty humor, ethics, intelligence, and style.  He's Tony Stark if Brett Ratner directed Iron Man.  Regardless, Hammer is a great villain and Sam Rockwell deserves some praise for a truly thankless performance.  All these great casting choices and I almost forget to mention that Iron Man gets some awesome help with the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the first screen appearance of sexy future Avenger Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and of course James Rhodes, who becomes War Machine.<br /><br />That is of course a summary worthy of some top of the line special effects and that is what these movies need if they are going to make big money.  They get it here within some outstanding action scenes, but Iron Man 2 deserves extra praise for being a thoughtfully written film that truly puts together one of the best casts I've ever seen for roles like this.  Gwenyth Paltrow (who returns as Pepper Potts) and Robert Downey, Jr. have chemistry well beyond the standards of normal action fare and Jon Favreau himself lends some legitimate comic relief, a staple in these films, hamming it up as Happy Hogan.  This is a fantastic action film that puts all the elements it takes to make a good film in their right place.  One nitpicking might be that I wanted to see more duel screen time for Rourke and Downey, Jr., being that both actors are at the top of their game and making us forget that they are still in the midst of their respective comebacks.  Iron Man versus Whiplash is turned into a rivalry that tops all but Batman and The Joker in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight</a>.  I can't wait to see what the future brings for Marvel Studios and Iron Man.  Oh, and do not forget to wait and watch after the credits for more hints toward future Marvel Studios projects.</p></body></html>

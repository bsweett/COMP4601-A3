Later I saw this film and I know, you see, Harrison Ford definitely didn't want this script.  It's tired, clithed, 'unworkable' -- the last word being from his interview.  Though I personally don't like him very much, I admit Ford is clever to bail out of the Jack Ryan series.  Yes, even though his anticipated "K-19" turned out a commercial failure.<p>That doesn't mean Ben Affleck is awful.  His is different Jack, so I get over it while watching it.  Though he was much. much, much better in the little-seen (but infinitely superiror) film called "Chasing Amy," Ben is OK.  Just OK, but no complaint.  His love story with Bridget Moynahan is tedious (as is his with lovely Liv in "Armageddon"), but let's talk about something else.  What is really, stinking awful is the story.<p>Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst, after his rather hasty, hot-shot behavior at the high-level military meeting at the US government, is given a job to follow the trace of three missing Russian nuclear scientists.  At the same time, a nuclear bomb that was hidden in the ground of the Golan Heights, falls into the wrong hand.  Those two incidents gradually lead to the catastorophe that happens in Super-Bowl Game in Baltimore.<p>The first half of the film goes steadily, in the fashion of John LeCaree novels.  Without showy explosions or gun-shots, the film maintains its suspence until the event that everyone probably has already known.  The film, until then an OK film, suddenly turns into a sheer nonsense -- actually, the film is from the beginning based on purely imaginative power, not close observation on history (when you loses a A-bomb, you usually try to find it, as Cuba Gooding Jr. film "Men of Honor" tells you), but after the big explosion, everything go derailed.  It's so laughable.<p>As many reviewers seem to have pointed out about the absurd use of computers or internet, let alone Jack Ryan's (who is still a  novice in CIA) amateur diplomatic skill over phone call, so let me add this only.  If you get into the city of Baltimore like he does, it is most certain that he is exposed to (lethal) amount of radioactivity, thus possibly culminating in his early death, or cancer.  Whoever knows something about the deadly accident in Russuan nuclear reactor that happened years ago, or much before, the US soldiers who witnessed the nuclear ground experiments in Nevada, will teach you precious things for Jack to know.  The way "The Sum of All Fears" treats nuclear weapons is a great insult to the victims and our intellect.<p>I know (or hope) the Hollywood really knows the truth; perhaps, they changed the truth for the purpose of entertainment value of the film.  But there's a limit to anything, and there should be in Hollywood.  I tried to ignore this kind of ignorance they commit, for instance, in "True Lies" -- where Tom Arnold tells people, when a nuclear missle explodes out at the sea of Miami, to cover their eyes with hands and it's okay.  Doesn't he know something named radioactivity?  Awful ignorance.<p>I tried to ignore these follies in Hollywood, but couldn't.  (In this sense, "Indepenence Day" was much less absurd in the description of nuclear weapons.)  And they did it again in "The Sum of All Fears."  The second half of the film is, even after forgetting that scene, full of incredible events and bad acting.  Morgan Freeman is good as ever, but his choice of roles is suspect these days; if you see his turn in "Street Smart," you see he is wasting talent in this rubbish.  Ben is so-so, but it is James Cromwell who needs another lecture on his overacting as the US president, and Henry Fonda in "Fail-Safe" would teach him how to play this kind of character. <p>The film ends in very unsatisfactory way, with bad guys punished (like in many other B-action flicks), and good guys smiling, vowing to live in peace, and Ben and Brigdet, talking about love on the sunny, green lawn, as if nothing happened in Baltimore.  This is unacceptable. even at the level of entertainment.  You say this is an entertainment, but are you really "entertained" with this?<p>Arnie's "Collateral Damage" was severely attacked because of its story involving terrorism, but it at least knew what it was doing as entertainment, with its larger-than-life situation and big, loud actions.  "The Sum of All Fears" apparently takes a more serious pose, capitalizing on our growing fear of these days.  But what it offers is insensible, ridiculous Hollywood routine that reaches the offensiveness.  To me, anyway.</p></body></html>

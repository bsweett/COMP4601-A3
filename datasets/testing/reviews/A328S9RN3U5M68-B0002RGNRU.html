<meta name="summary" content="As Mysterious and Exhilarating as Life Itself: A Mind Prism"></head><body><p>ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is as original and fascinating as anything Charlie Kaufman has written previously. Kaufman has the ability to take a tiny thought/idea and trace it through the minds of his characters much like the way synapses propel sensory input.  And in doing so he provides more intelligent insights about personality variations and relationships and the vulnerability and neediness of contemporary man than just about any person writing scripts today.  This is 21st Century existentialism delivered in the most cogent manner.<br /><br />But the story would be only half told were it not for director Michel Gondry and his enormously gifted cast of characters:  Jim Carrey finally demonstrates his innate thespian gifts with the role of Joel, a laid back, fearful, needy cookie-cutter piece of a man who finally finds someone who loves him in goofy Clementine (the always superb Kate Winslet) only to have the 'business' of memory erasing (run by Dr. Miarzwiak - Tom Wilkinson - assisted by his technicians Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) destroy his new found happiness and drive him to the same extreme that drove Clementine to have their memories of each other erased.  Despite the apparent linear storyline this film begins to act like the confusion of electrical stimuli to brain cells and for the remainder of the the movie we are not sure how the idea is playing out until the magic ending which is so fine that it should be withheld from those who have not experienced this film.  This is cinema of the first rank, up there in the echelon of Resnais, Fellini, Almodovar and others who have been practitioneers of the bizarre yet wholly committed art of mind manipulation.  This film may take some work from you, may require a couple of watchings, but it is time well spent.  Let's hope there are more collaborations between Kaufman and Gondry - and even this cast - in the future!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They saved the best for last!"></head><body><p>Imagine removing the slow burn between action scenes of the first movie, ramping up the action scenes of the second movie, and throwing the result (together with a dozen more mutants) into one film. That's what you have with XMTLS. Fans who cheered in the theater during the second film when Wolverine killed the guy in the kitchen will get more than their fill of claw-slashing action.<br /><br />XMTLS is an incredible film and easily the best of the series. While it's true they probably tried to put too much into one short film (this is the shortest of the three for some reason with the largest cast), Ratner and company do an admirable job of pulling it off for the most part. While rumors abound this is the last one due to contract problems with certain "Stormy" stars, this film proves if nothing else that the X-Men universe can survive without the whole cast. There are enough heroes waiting in the wings to get treatments that we can afford to lose anyone not willing to return.<br /><br />The film pulls off some key moments in powerful ways. The problem is that it tries to pull off TOO MANY key moments and therefore loses the impact of most of them. Yes, we finally get to see the Danger Room. Yes, The Angel finally makes an appearance (for about ten minutes of film time). Yes, The Beast is every bit as cool in the movies as he is in the comics (Grammar does an amazing job of perfectly portraying Hank McCoy's intellect while pulling off some amazing fighting moves). And hey, they've thrown in Juggernaut, Colossus, Sprite, Psylocke, Madrox the Multiple Man, Arclight, Marrow, and Spike. And Iceman finally "ices up"!<br /><br />What did they do wrong? In adding so many characters, there's not enough screen time for them. Rogue uses her powers ONCE early in the film when she could have been used in a great way during the climactic battle scene at the end. The death of a MAJOR character ten minutes into the film is only alluded to rather than shown (which is a rip since we've stuck with this person through two other films). Speaking of deaths, this film pulls out all the stops. The Xavier Institute's backyard goes from scenic to a graveyard in ONE FILM! Shouldn't we have spaced these out a little?<br /><br />Still, despite giving too much in too little time (this could have easily gone over the two hour mark without making anyone upset), this is the best film of the series. Hugh Jackman adds a depth to the character of Wolverine with one scene that truly shows how he's grown from the previous two installments. Storm becomes a central player to the team finally. And we see the Colossus/Wolverine "Fastball Special" from the comics. Ratner even throws in a little curve of his own after the credits finish rolling to show there could still be life in the franchise if anyone's interested. I'd say we definitely all are! Cut down the cast a little (for heaven's sake, lose Magneto! The "Mutants are superior to Homo Sapiens" routine has gotten too old and the guy's more of an irritation than a menace now), add some faces to give us more fun (Gambit could appear to add some spice to the Rogue/Iceman/Sprite love triangle), lengthen the movie (by at least a half hour to give us a breather between explosions), and keep giving Wolverine people to slash and we'll all be happy! A highly recommended movie!</p></body></html>

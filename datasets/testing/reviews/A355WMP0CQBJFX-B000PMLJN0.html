<meta name="summary" content="BEWARE THE STARE OF MARY SHAW!!!"></head><body><p>dead silence, was anything but dead. from start to finish it just had you, and that finish you will not see coming. an evil women lives through her dolls, to kill all of those who did her wrong. and if you yell or try to scream she'll rip your tongue out quick as can be. a young man must return home after the death of his fiance, and face the father he is estranged from to find out why and who killed his love. once there, he is reminded of the story of the great puppeteer mary shaw. and discovers his familys involvement in her death, and why she seeks revenge. there he uncovers more than he's ready to face. just remember don't scream. i love these crazy living doll movies. they sometimes tend to freak you out because they look evil already, and if they really were alive we'd all be in trouble. this movie was great. from the killer dolls, to the crazy mary shaw, to the real doll in the end. fantastic.</p></body></html>

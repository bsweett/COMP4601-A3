<meta name="summary" content="A FLAWED, BUT VERY ENGAGING GHOST STORY  8.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed The Orphanage, it was a unique and different horror film. Sure it has its flaws, but it was really enjoyable which is no surprise considering Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy 1 & 2, Pan's Labyrinth) helped make this film. Like Pan's Labyrinth this film is in Spanish, and as a foreign film it is definitely superior to most American-made horror films.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Laura is a 37-year-old woman (She looks like she's in her 50's though) who was an orphan during her childhood has now returned to her childhood home, moved in and is converting it into a home for children with special needs with her husband and adopted son. During the beginning of the film, her son keeps saying he's made a new friend named Tomas, but there's no one there. During a party celebrating the opening of the home, Laura's son disappears mysteriously without a trace. Then the rest of the film focuses on the months Laura spends trying to find her son and she discovers that her son's imaginary friend Tomas is an angry ghost who died years ago and Laura slowly uncovers what happened in the Orphanage those many years ago, and she slowly goes crazier by the day and no one believes what she says.<br />MUSIC: The music is creepy and suspenseful as it should be in any horror film and is very well done.<br />ACTION: Don't expect some bloody gorefest out of this film or some stupid cliched ghost story like The Messengers, no this film is focused almost exclusively on dialogue, with the occasional scare. But when this film wants to be frightening, it damn sure gets the job done in this category. This film is superior to just about any ghost film I've ever seen and is well-executed and it does not feel cliched (Except for the part when they rip off Poltergeist). This film as a whole is quite brilliant, even if its quality suffers do to moments of boredom. This film also has one of the most bizarre endings I've ever seen that will definitely leave you going; "What the f***?" but in a good way.<br />ACTING: There were some awkward moments, but the actors were very good as a whole. The dialogue was never really corny and it felt real most of the time and you actually seemed to feel that characters were scared. Props to the actors for their great performances.<br />OVERALL: The Orphanage is easily one of the most original horror films ever made, and is definitely better than most of the ghost films you'll find. Buy it now, dammit.<br />THE GOOD: Great acting, great music, intelligent storyline, and creepy imagery.<br />THE BAD: Moments of boredom, some questionable acting.</p></body></html>

In this contrived rags-to-riches story, hip hop's great white hope Eminem is Rabbit, who struggles to hold down a job while living in a trailer park with his mom (Kim Basinger) and kid sister.  But Rabbit's skills as a rapper get the attention of his peers, who try to give him enough encouragement to compete in a heated hip hop face-off which may lead to a promising record deal.  Lacking both confidence and self-esteem, Rabbit avoids the challenge until he meets his love interest, played by Brittany Murphy.  From there begins an against-all-odds story that's been done before, but better ("Purple Rain" and "Rocky").  Director Curtis Hanson ("Wonder Boys," "L.A. Confidential") takes a bizarre step backwards in this movie and fails to extract any genuine emotion from the cast or its settings.  The result is a film that's as processed as a Swanson TV dinner.  Scenes that are supposed to have emotional weight drew unintended laughs from this viewer, who was left baffled as to how this became a hit other than Eminem's bankability as a star.  Women don't get a fair shake in this movie, either, for they are portrayed as irresponsible, self-centered, and promiscuous.  And the scene where Rabbit defends a gay man seems like an all too calculated move to counter arguments that Eminem is homophobic.  Speaking of Emimen, it's hard to determine how good an actor he really is based on "8 Mile."  To his benefit, he appears natural and relaxed in front of the camera, but the story mirrors his own so closely that one could argue that he's merely playing himself.  The concept of acting is that you're stepping OUTSIDE of character when delivering a performance.  In this movie, Eminem stays well WITHIN character, so, thusly, there's no performance.  The hip hop themes, its Detroit location, and its script provide an all too secure safety net for the rapper.  Not that it will matter to 15-year-olds nationwide.  Surely, the time will come when Hollywood makes a gritty and powerful hip hop drama, but until then, we're gonna have to settle for movies like "8 Mile."</p></body></html>

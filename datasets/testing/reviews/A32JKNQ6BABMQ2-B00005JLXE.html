<meta name="summary" content="the man without fear"></head><body><p>lets get its flaws out of the way first.its not necessary to show a small boy being blinded,screaming in agony at the hospital and the like.what is it with movie makers and graphic portrayels of kids suffering?damn!would you all stop it already.the whole daredevil comic was also summed up in one movie.it has been out a long time.some of daredevils stunts all over the rooftops were hardly belivable,especialy for a blind man.and lastly,that the kingpin is a gigantic,fat white guy not a pretty big,thick,black man.are we color blind?does it just not matter what a guys color is?i bet you a lot of people would get mad if a movie got made about oprah with rosanne playing her or one about martin king with danny devto cast as the doc.now the cat woman is black too.this is stupid.can eveyone just stay the right color please?in this one a kid gets blinded .his other senses get bettter,but his take off to super extraordinary levels.he becomes the daredevil.lawyer by day,masked vigilante by night.well,the kingpin whos now a homeboy crimeboss.since were on the subject,crimeBOSSES,are almost always white.the thugs are black.check your statistics!but,anyway the kingpin is getting pod that his men keep getting wasted.yes,they are white.so,he gets this crazy irish guy called bulleseye to kill him.bulleseye has a few powers of his own.1-anything whatsoever he picks up,he can use lethaly.2-he never misses-except in this movie when hes fighting the daredevil,3-his bones are laced like wolverines with admantium.im betting they didnt use that in the movie either.ben affleck plays daredevil.it is the best ben affleck movie ever! i like jay and silent bob strikes back better.but he was in that for only a few minutes and whined like a littlke girl the whole time.youre the parent you make the call with this one.i couldnt really say.it is one of the better comic book films lately.if you liked them,youll like this one too.elektra is a long time rival of daredevils in the comic book but here shes his girlfriend and she is HOT!!!!!!!!!too bad she never goes full frontal.hype says its not that good.the real deal is its better than the average comic flick.the action is awesome.there is a fight between dd and everyone i named.will there be a sequel?if you watched the credits,and lets be honest,nobody does,you ll see bullseye all muffed up in a hospital bed.now this did happen...........wait a minute!no it didnt!daredevil had a building fall on him from bulleseye.nevermind!its a good movie.the creators just had a hard time seeing to make it with thier heads so far up thuer asses.maybe thats why its about a blind guy.</p></body></html>

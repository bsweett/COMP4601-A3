<meta name="summary" content="Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead."></head><body><p>I grew up reading fairy tales that were laced with death and violent imagery. The Little Mermaid, the Little Match Girl, the Red Shoes, the Snow Queen, the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, and the Fir Tree. All of those and many more had such sadness, and loss, and they were meant to stir up the imagination as well as teach us a lesson. Pan's Labyrinth is supposed to be one of those tales, and it almost reaches the goals it sets but not quite. I allowed myself some time, between watching it and writing a review to let it all sink in, because right after you watch it you have a lot of emotional conflictions.<br /><br />I love foreign films, because usually they tend to give me another view of society, and cultures I am unfamiliar with. Different locations in this world have different tales to tell, and most are influenced by the history of that land. I always watch them in the original language, with subtitles, because you cannot get the message when it's dubbed.<br /><br />This movie started out well, its promise was apparent, but it soon went downhill for me. It had beautiful imagery, costumes, and the effects were both awesome and mediocre. They dropped the ball when it came to the real life drama, the gore and bloody scenes. While they were horrifying, I could tell what CGI was and what wasn't. The fantasy effects were amazing, especially with the Faun and the Baby eating demon. They were full and lush and inspiring. However they totally dropped the ball in the end, when Ofelia gets to the underworld it was the hugest most disappointing ending I have ever seen, worst even than Jodie Fosters "Contact".<br /><br />The story brought us through the hope of the princess returning, her heartache at losing her family, her love of her brother, her journey through the relentless tasks the Faun gave her and the peril she faced with her stepfather...and than in the end , after all that buildup, we get gypped. Her walking into that bright room, three thrones and a standing ovation by whomever...was in Eric Cartman's great words...."Lame". I got no feeling of joy; I felt no awe over her return. Here they showed us this superb creature, the Faun, and really they just dumped all their eggs in that effect basket and ignored everything else.<br /><br />I would say watch it, for the Faun and for the almost awesomeness of it all, its worth a look, but don't expect to come away satisfied.</p></body></html>

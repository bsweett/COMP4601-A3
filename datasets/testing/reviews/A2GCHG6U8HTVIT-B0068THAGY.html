<meta name="summary" content="Let's make a hit, says JJ Abrams. So much for making a good movie."></head><body><p>JJ Abrams has made hit movies. Has he ever made a good movie? With Super 8, he wrote, directed and produced two movies, and sacrificed the good to make sure he had a hit.<br /><br />Super 8 begins just fine, the story of a group of young teens making a movie about zombies. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is determined to enter his movie in a film contest. He's the director and writer. Joe (Joel Courtney) is his best friend and make-up specialist.  When Charles recruits Alice (Elle Fanning) for a role (she can drive and they need a car), Joe starts to learn what puberty can do to a fella.<br /><br />We're off on a small town adventure of stealth movie making, improvisation, determination, spontaneity and, as far as I know, effective zombie acting. One night when the kids have sneaked away from their homes to film a night scene at the railway station, Charles sees a train coming. "Production values!" he happily exclaims and sets up the scene so the train roaring by will be in his movie. Bad luck. A truck drives onto the tracks and smashes head on into the train. There's a massive derailment only Hollywood CGI can create. It goes on and on.<br /><br />Now the young moviemakers are center stage in a new movie, this one about an alien creature captured by the Air Force and in the charge of a particularly ruthless colonel and his men. This movie is made to insure a hit with that real-life demographic, the 16 through 28 crowd. Yes, in the crash the alien, which looks something like a quick-stepping giant tarantula crossbred with the real mama from hell in Alien, escapes. Thanks to a couple of film cartons the kids dropped as they ran from the crash, the colonel figures out someone might have seen too much and filmed it. Soon dogs run away from town, engines from cars are stolen, electronic gear disappears and people vanish, all in clouds of wowzer and predictable special effects.<br /><br />In the course of Super 8 we'll follow young Joe through adventures that now are by the numbers...evacuations, tanks, house explosions, great caverns, missing townspeople including Alice hanging upside down waiting to become alien snacks, Joe's face-to-face heroism with the big bug, and one of the most non-thrilling examples of spaceship building in any movie. Although the alien looks like something really big that escaped from an insect zoo, it turns out that, despite its chomping down on people with slobber and lots of teeth, it's really just a guy (or woman) who is scared and lonely, who has been treated badly by the Air Force, and just wants to build a spaceship so it can go home.<br /><br />JJ Abrams creates a warm, nostalgic story about kids back in the Seventies who are energetically making a movie while keeping it secret from adults. The kid actors do a fine, believable job and we like them. Their small town is a great place to live in. Charles' family is a wonderful mix of love and chaos. We're hooked with these kids and with Charles' movie. And all this just becomes loose ends. (We do get to see Charles' movie during the credits...like an afterthought.<br /><br />In his determination to win a big audience, Abrams sacrifices all that in favor of by-the-numbers demographic pandering and CGI. Abrams worked for Steven Spielberg for a while and Spielberg is a producer of Super 8. Spielberg's influence is all over the movie. If you liked The Goonies, which I do, you'll like a third of Super 8, a movie with no center, just calculation.</p></body></html>

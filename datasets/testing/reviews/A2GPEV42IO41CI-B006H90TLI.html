<meta name="summary" content="Very effective thriller"></head><body><p>The story opens in the desolate west Texas countryside, as Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad and makes off with a suitcase full of money.  He figures he'll be followed and he's right; Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a ruthless and patient killer, is after him.  Chigurh is, in turn, being tracked by the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), a good ol' country boy who's amazed at how violent criminals have become lately.<br /><br />I'd heard this was a bloody guy-movie so I watched it grudgingly, but I actually liked it a lot.  Yes, it's got a high body count but the violence wasn't off-putting and the cat-and-mouse tale is spell-binding.  The tension stays at 100% throughout and is really frightening.  It's a battle of wits and the only question is:  Will Good win over Evil?  The movie won a Best Picture Oscar and Bardem won for Best Supporting Actor. He's very convincing and charismatic as the heartless madman and does a great American accent.  Jones is perfect as the good ol' boy sheriff, philosophizin' 'bout bad guys.  Brolin was fine as the everyman character of Llewelyn.<br /><br />This is a no-holds barred shoot 'em up for sure, but I still recommend it as an entertaining and well-made film.</p></body></html>

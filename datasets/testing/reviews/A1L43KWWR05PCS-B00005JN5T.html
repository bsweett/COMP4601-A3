<meta name="summary" content="WHAT THE FOCK..."></head><body><p>This is the sequel to the very successful film, "Meet the Parents". Although  the director tries to reprise the success that he enjoyed with the prequel, he falls short of the mark. In the final analysis, this film is simply not as funny. It is too contrived and forced, and some of the humor falls flat.<br /><br />The basic premise of this film is that Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) is going to marry his fiancee, Pamela Bynes (Teri Lord). Consequently, her parents, Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner), are going to meet his parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand), for the first time. This is a proposition that has Gaylord in a state of total anxiety.<br /><br />Gaylord, who prefers to be called "Greg", and  Pamela join her parents in order to travel down to Florida, where the Focker family lives. Joining them is the Byrnes' cute baby grandson, Little Jack (Spencer and Bradley Pickren). They all travel to Florida in Jack's custom made, kevlar coated, state-of-the-art RV. When they get there, the clash of the titans begins, as the conservative Byrnes are polar opposites of the ultra-liberal Fockers, and never the twain shall meet.<br /><br />Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner are, once again,  excellent in their respective roles, as are Teri Lord and Ben Stiller. Unfortunately, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand fall flatter than a pancake, being neither funny or likable. This is not necessarily their fault. The fault lies in the screenplay, as their characters are too contrived. Rather than funny, they end up being simply annoying.  Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand manage to hit simultaneous career lows with their respective roles. How the mighty have fallen.<br /><br />Still, the film is not a total loss, as it does provide some laughs. One should, however, rent this film, rather than buy it.</p></body></html>

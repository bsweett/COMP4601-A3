<meta name="summary" content="Worth watching again"></head><body><p>I have read seemingly unsatisfied reviews about the movie, such suffering a mixed identity from being a mystery, thriller, &amp;/or horror story.  So, I decided to see it for myself.  Without reading the gist at the back of the DVD cover, I had little expectations to begin with.  I noticed its remarkable similarity with Agatha Christie's &quot;And then there was none&quot; (The Psycho set-up was a given).  Of course, once the sentenced serial killer was introduced in the screen, everything fell in its place &amp; the movie sort of became predictable (especially the ending). But nonetheless, it was a good twist.  Like Memento (starring Guy Pierce), I wouldn't hesitate watching it again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Satisfying and engaging Samurai epic. One of 2003s best!"></head><body><p>"The Last Samurai" is everything a movie should be - exciting, emotional, and involving. Though I would not go so far to say that it's a masterpiece, it is one of the better movies I have seen in 2003, and without having seen the new "Lord of the Rings", it's definitely near the top of the list. It will no doubt draw comparison with "Braveheart" because of the epic battles and the emotional climax, but thankfully avoids becoming derivative of other "battle epics".<p>Tom Cruise (who spent two years learning Japanese) plays Nathan Algren, a civil war hero who has fallen off the right path and is now washed up and heavily into the booze. His fortunes change when he is commissioned by the Emperor of Japan to help train his army to fight efficiently against the Samurai who roam the country. His success with that endeavor is short lived when he is captured by the Samurai during a devastating battle. He spends the next several months living among them and adopting their ways, and growing fond of the discipline, skill, and tact that the Samurai display. Knowing of the Emperor's motives to rid Japan of the people and way of life he has come to embrace, he joins them in their battle against insurmountable odds. <p>There are many subplots and characters, some predictable Hollywood fodder (do you smell a love story cooking?), but most are effective and necessary to the overall story. "The Last Samurai" is tempered with humorous moments that help to balance the violence that is peppered throughout. As you can expect, many of the battles are long, drawn out, and very bloody. But the violence is never gratuitous, and it knows it's limits. As far as performances go, Tom Cruise is nothing if not reliable, and his largely Japanese supporting cast all do a great job in hitting their cues and making us believe in them. What really deserves special mention is the cinematography, which captures Japans lush valleys, majestic temples, and overall aesthetic beauty. The battle choreography is also stellar, obviously benefiting for painstaking direction and CGI effects. <p>"The Last Samurai" is not a history lesson, so you are unlikely to walk away from it having gained a substantial knowledge of the Samurai customs and traditions. What you will get out of it is a fantastic movie-going experience that satisfies on every level, which is exactly what we go to movies for.</p></body></html>

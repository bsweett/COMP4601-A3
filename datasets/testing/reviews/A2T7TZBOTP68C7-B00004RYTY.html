The film stars Franka Potente as neon-red hair colored Lola who is literally running through most of the film as she tries to save her boyfriend's life.  Manni is working his way into a criminal organization, yet we can see that he is a genuinely good guy.  Manni is supposed to bring 100,000 marks to the dropoff - but Lola is late picking him up.  Thus starts a chain of events that ends disastrously, but begins again.<br /><br />Manni leaves the money on a subway.  A bum steals the bag.  If Manni does not come up with the money in twenty minutes, he will be killed.  He phones Lola from a phone booth, sobbing.  He wants to rob the store across the way.  She says, No, Manni, Wait for me.  I am coming and I will think of something.  Her father is a bank president, but his relationship with his daughter is not good, and he has problems of his own, as we can see.  Family and human relationships are portrayed excellently in this film.  The acting is great.<br /><br />In this way, Run Lola Run is disjointed and post-modernist.  People who prefer their story given straight up will say this film is weird.  My husband did not like the mix of animation, techno music, and backwards/start over time frames.<br /><br />Which version of events is the real one?  That is up to the viewer.  One thing is for sure - you will be cheering for Lola as she runs.</p></body></html>

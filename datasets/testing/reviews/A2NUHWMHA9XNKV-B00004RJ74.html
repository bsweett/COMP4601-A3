<meta name="summary" content="Classic Tarintino"></head><body><p>Watching this movie is like viewing two separate movies that are loosely related. The first half is classic Tarintino with excellent dialogue and bizarre situations. The second half is entirely different than anything Q.T. has ever done. At first I didn't like it, because I was hoping for another Pulp fiction, but after I let it stand on its own I realized it is very good.</p></body></html>

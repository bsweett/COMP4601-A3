I have to admit, I liked it.<br /><br /> The story is pretty simple. Five people get superpowers after being exposed to a space storm. One of them becomes the evil Dr. Doom. The become the FANTASTIC FOUR!<br /><br /> I enjoyed this flick. I hope there is a sequel. Filled with fine special effects, cool action, and some humor, FF is a must see summer movie. My favorite has to be the Thing. Don't listen to the "offical" Ebert and Roeper reviews "Fantastic Four isn't so fantastic! Hardy-har!" Screw 'em.<br /><br /> UPDATE: So far, you guys don't seem to like my review. Just because my review is short, doesn't me you have to hate it.</p></body></html>

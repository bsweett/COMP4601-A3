<meta name="summary" content="Very Fun"></head><body><p>I am a big fan of Stephen Sommers, and Alan Silvestri. I also enjoy watching Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman act.<br /><br />This is an amazing film, technically, and the acting and plot is exceptional too. I don't believe all the negative reviews!<br /><br />I watched this twice, and enjoyed it a lot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A highly unpredictable first rate action thriller"></head><body><p>I was rather frustrated with the large number of F words in this movie, as I don't understand why this word is used even once. But, I having already watched Pulp Fiction and Scarface, do know that it could've been worse. On the other hand, I am obligated to give this movie 5 stars because of the excellent but somewhat confusing plot (at least the first time you watch it), the unpredicatable ending, the great shootouts, the neat humor, and the mystery of Keiser Soze. This movie will definitely be a lot better to understand the more times you see it. If you rewatch it, you can tell many things that you hadn't beforehand. Well, anyway, now for the plot. The movie opens with Gabriel Bryn's character getting shot, and the boat he's on gets set to fire. But then, we go back in time with these 5 criminals played by Gabriel Bryne, Stephen Baldwin, the comic but very hard to understand Benicio Del Torro, the marvelous Kevin Pollack, and of course Kevin Spacey whose character is crippled. These criminals are interviewed in prison but never get convicted. You watch them as they hold up cars and so forth. And then comes the scene where the messenger of someone who's either a myth or real called Keiser Soze who arrives. This man tells them that Mr. Soze wants them to hijack a boat and retrieve the cocaine on it. The criminals refuse but he informs them that Mr. Soze knows all of their criminal records. When they try to take this messenger out later, he says that Mr. Soze will kill their love ones if they refuse. You then find out that Soze (which you always don't know if he exists or not) is a madman who killed his own wife and children and killed many other men , women and children. The group of criminals have to now kill many bodyguards and cuban men to retrieve this cocaine. What happens next is amazing and very unpredictable. I won't give away anything else but, besides the bad words, you're in for a treat.</p></body></html>

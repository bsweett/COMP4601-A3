The bloody sequences along the film achieve the highest peak in the final confrontation between these abominable creatures.<br /><br />Forget about the script. It makes no sense to talk about it. The main ingredient in the most of cases, is to maintain the spectator tied to his chair, providing us of abundant doses of scare and adrenaline with the accustomed satisfaction of having watched the gore in its highest level.<br /><br />Robert Englund is the star of the show. Brilliant and effective as the feared Freddy Krueger.</p></body></html>

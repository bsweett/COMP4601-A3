Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle. I don't know anyone who ever dozed asleep watching this, so it's not all bad. It's actually a fun movie.<br /><br />Despite the moronic and unlikeable characters who uttered some stupid dialog, the movie gets you very involved and is one of the better pure-action movies I've ever seen. The jungle scenery is outstanding to view on DVD. This is a pretty movie for such low-grade material, story-wise. I watched it a second time just for the visuals.<br /><br />Speaking of visuals, it's disappointing that the Blu-Ray transfer is so poor...at least according to most of the reviewers here, whom I believe. I would have gladly upgraded but now I'm a little leery of doing that.</p></body></html>

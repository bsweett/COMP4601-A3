The entire time, I was growling about it.  Now, to the movie.  I expected more than what I received.  I wasn't very interested in the court drama, it was like watching Law and Order made into a movie.  I was impressed by the few scenes they showed when Emily Rose was possessed, but that was the only thing that truly held my interest during the entire viewing.  There weren't very many extras, nothing that would really be worth taking a look at in my opinion.  I think a rental is good enough, a lot may disagree, but I can't see spending 20.00 on this.</p></body></html>

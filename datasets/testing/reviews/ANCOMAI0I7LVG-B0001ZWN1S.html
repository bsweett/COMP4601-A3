<meta name="summary" content="`The Greatest Film of All Time'; I think it earned that title..."></head><body><p>Quite frankly, `The Godfather' truly is technically perfect.  In fact, it is so perfect that writing this review has been an Achilles-Heel for me.  I have wanted to write this review for a while now but have been deathly afraid of failing to do it justice.  It's a rarity to have a film this universally lauded; this universally respected and honestly there really is no other film that comes close to being as well loved and adored as `The Godfather'.  So with that, where do you go?  What do you say?  How can you begin to review a film of this magnitude?<br /><br />I'll start by saying that everything (good) that has been said about this film is true.<br /><br />I'll work from there.<br /><br />It has been said that `The Godfather' is that rare film that just feels right from beginning to end.  Every facet seems to fit just perfect, seems to flow evenly and brilliantly.  Every actor is perfect (and I do truly mean perfect) for their roles.  They melt into character and never break, always elevating the scenes they embody.  The script is tightly woven, intricate and engrossing.  The direction by Francis Ford Coppola may very well be the single greatest directive execution in the history of film making.  His delivery of this marvelous film is really what helps create its sheer presence and undeniable commanding power.  Coppola cemented himself here as one of the great directors of all time.<br /><br />The film tells the story of the Corleone family.  The family is run by the `Don' Vito Corleone.  He's an aging man, yet very respected and admired.  Known as `Godfather', Vito has much power within the organized crime families and thus is looked to often for aid and support.  When he is looked to for that support in the aid of heroin distribution on the part of the Tattaglia family, Vito finds that his higher standard of morality clashes with the direction the `underworld' is taking.  His refusal to lend aid to the Tattaglia family places the Corleone family in danger.<br /><br />This forms the catalyst for the films major plot and thus unfolds in a marvelous manor, allowing the audience to become completely and utterly absorbed in the events taking place on the screen.  As Vito's life is placed in danger and his youngest son Michael crosses over into the life he swore he'd never embrace, `The Godfather' quickly becomes the most interesting and highly entertaining film one could possible imagine.<br /><br />The performances by the entire cast are flawless, utterly flawless.  Marlon Brando effortlessly embodies Vito with such memorable charisma and temperance.  His performance is truly one of the greatest of all time.  Al Pacino delivers his finest performance ever as Michael Corleone.  This performance is of course one that he hones and perfects (his delivery in `The Godfather Part II' is truly the finest of his career) and becomes one with.  Pacino is one of those actors that I feel has suffered in recent years from lack of good source material.  Anyone new to the works of Pacino may write him off as a no talent veteran actor who stars in one worthless film after another; and judging by his recent films they would be justified in their feelings; but when you take a look at where this actor came from you will see that when he was in his prime he was truly brilliant.  James Caan is also amazing here as the hotheaded Santino (or `Sonny' as he is referred).  His performace is electric to say the least.  Robert Duval is also on the top of his game and delivers yet another flawless performance (now here is an actor who has never lost his touch) and John Cazale delivers nicely as Fredo, the `Dons' other son.  His performance in `The Godfather Part II' is much more effective and defined, but he sets a nice foundation for himself here.  Another performance that is fleshed out nicely in the sequel is that of Kay Adams, who is played by Diane Keaton.  Her performance here is subtle and short, but her character is one of the most memorable in the films that follow.<br /><br />`The Godfather' truly stands the test of time as one of the most recognizable and highly lauded films ever released.  Many critics consider this the finest movie ever filmed, and technically I feel they are correct.  There isn't a single flaw to be seen here for everything and everyone is a perfect compliment to one another.<br /><br />I don't know what more I can say without either spoiling too much of the films plot (there is a lot to be seen here, yet it never feels rushed or over-stuffed which is yet another marvelous accomplishment) or rambling on to the point of exhaustion so I'll stop here; ending by quite simply saying that `The Godfather' will leave the viewing with absolutely no regrets.  It is quite simply perfect in every way shape and form and is the pure definition of `cinema'.  This is what the movies are all about; great storytelling; and no greater story has ever been told.</p></body></html>

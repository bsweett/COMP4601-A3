<meta name="summary" content="One of Sandler, Brooks' Best"></head><body><p>There is a disclaimer that should be attached to this movie.  If you come into this movie expecting to see a Adam Sandler movie that resembles Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or even Big Daddy, then you will be incredibly disappointed.  Yes James L. Brooks is one of the writers for The Simpsons, and the writer of Taxi, but this is anything but a slapstick comedy.<br /><br />This movie is described perfectly by its title.  Spanglish can mean the lack of communication between cultures, but for this movie it represents the lack of understanding of people's feelings and the lack of communication amongst husband and wife, or a whole family in general.  And yes, there is a lot of spanish spoken to people who don not understand the language.<br /><br />The movie is about John Clasky (Sandler) a four-star chef who works nights, and his wife, the neurotic Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is  used to working days. Consequently, they need a little help around the house. Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman), a washed-up jazz singer who spends her time in the bottom of a wine glass, isn't much help. The Claskys run an ad for a maid and hire Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who so hated to leave her native land for the bustle of Los Angeles that she's never learned English in her six years in America.  The familes relationship is really good until Deborah wants to move into a summer rental home in Malibu.  She wants Flor to tag along, but there is one problem.  Flor has a daughter named Christina, whom she has never mentioned to the Claskys, and Flor doesn't want to leave Christina behind.  So Deborah insists that Christina can also live with the family.  Then the trouble starts.  Deborah takes Christina shopping without Flor's permission.  John gives Christina $640 for finding sea glass.  Flor, being a very proud Mexican lady, does not like the Claskys doing these things for her daughter and becomes upset.  Then new relationships are built, some are destroyed and people learn to respect others wishes.<br /><br />As for the performances, this is Sandler's best to date.  Tea Lioni does a really good job at being someone that there is no possible way of liking.  Cloris Leachman steals many scenes and is always funny when she is one screen.  She must have had some good guidence from Mel Brooks for all those years.  The stand out performance is Paz Vega.  She cannot express herself too much in words, so most of her expression comes her facial expressions.  Kind of like Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands.  She resembles Penelope Cruz a lot, but is a better actress.<br /><br />The movies itself is really good, one of the years best movies.  The only real problem that I had with the movie is that is seemed to be about 10 minutes long.  Other than that, there was nothing else that bothered me.  James L. Brooks has done is again.  It seems like everytime he starts to write, something good is formed.  And Spanglish may be his best to date.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It takes a lot of pain to make a smart man into a wise man"></head><body><p>This is a highly entertaining film that gets more intense as the film reaches the end. Forest Whitaker does a wonderful job of playing General Idi Amin Dada, a man who rises to power in Uganda becoming the dictator of the country. He is genuinely frightening. James McAvoy plays the young immature Scottish medical doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, who finds himself in a lot of trouble in this troubled nation.<br /><br />The film and the main character, Dr. Garrigan, are fictional; however they are based on the actual history of Idi Amin Dada's genocidal tyranny and the PLO high jacking in Entebbe. Nicholas comes to Uganda on a lark and works in a mission clinic where he tries to seduce the physician's vulnerable wife with little regard for those around him. He meets the General by accident and impresses Amin. Nicholas Garrigan is at first entranced and entertained by Amin Dada's commanding personality, sarcastic wit, and unique views. However the longer Nicholas remains in the court of Amin Dada, the more complicit he becomes to the evil that is generated and the more mistakes and false steps he takes that begin to distance him from Amin Dada.<br /><br />In some ways the film is about maturity. Clever, witty, intelligent folks from privileged Western backgrounds will sometimes underestimate the level of threat and danger present in situations outside of North American culture. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is one of those folks and his underestimation of the forces of evil bring great harm to those around him and to himself.  Amin confronts him at the end of the film for being an egotistical Westerner who had decided to play with the natives for a lark. Amin shows him that the natives don't play.<br /><br />The Entebbe Airport high jacking by the PLO is relevant to the story and young Nicholas comes very close to losing his life. Will he be a wiser man due to his painful experiences? McAvoy does such a great job of portraying this flippant egotist that even after much pain and death, I doubted that he had changed his ways. This is not a very optimistic vision of human character. In fact it is darkly pessimistic. Idi Amin Dada is a rare occurrence, a homicidal tyrant who thinks nothing of genocide. But Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is not such a rare specimen, for he represents the smart young brass egotist who can do great harm because he lacks the experience and especially the wisdom to avoid danger. When his egotism involves others in exposure to danger he certainly becomes less charming and sympathetic a character.<br /><br />The film is great entertainment, great suspense, and great acting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the matrix set"></head><body><p>well if you like bullets,lasers and explosions,this one is for you.problem is,thats it too.the world is free of humans.the computers have designed thier own world and only a few master hackers realize this.they are the black guy from thejedi council in the new star wars movies,ted from bill and ted and the crippled guy from oz.in the first one,they train ted to do all the state of the art,over the top awesome moves he does.it is truly breathtaking to behold!theres plenty of action!in reloaded they go deeper into the computers program to figure out how to beat it.theres a 12 minute long car chase scene that is the most excellent car chase scene of all time!theres also a lot of that crazy -spacey-gravity defying-kung fu stuff that they do.in revolutions they  go to the central core of whats holding the computer world together and rage war on it.then these millions and millions of robotic squid things come out.theres a big bunch of shooting and boom boom boom.the end.its too violent for kids i think.it seems as though they spent so much money on the squids,.in part 3 only,they forgot a storyline or anything else that goes with a movie.just boom boom boom.outof the 3,it basicly just wraps the first two up.in the first 2,there were stories,chicks,plots,scenes,and places.this had a dark place filled with squids.of the 3,this one is a distant 3rd.if you like sci fi and action youll love all 3 of them for they set the abselute standard for our time as far as sci fi goes.the first time this happened was in the late 60s when 2001:a space odyssey made all others before it obselete.than no one could touch it until star wars in the late 70s.the next batch to take over was the terminater series.now its the matrix trilogy.in part 3,.this one black chick does some awesome pilot work in one of the movies most exiting parts.the hype was better than the movie actualy turned out to be.not to discredit it though as an excellent movie.hollywood tries to advertise every movie as exiting as armageddon but fails a lot.this is keeono.uuuuhhhhhhh.....teds third best movie ever.ill give you one guess what the other two are.the trilogy ends here.it is a bit long,but good.</p></body></html>

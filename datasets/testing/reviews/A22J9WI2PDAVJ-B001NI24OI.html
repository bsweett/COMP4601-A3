<meta name="summary" content="Big time Texas High School football!"></head><body><p>"Friday Night Lights (2004)" is based on a true story. H.G. Bissinger is the author. Deep in the heart of West Texas nothing else matters when high school football is on. City versus city put their bragging rights on the line when high school rivalries clash. If you do not bring home the championship you are considered a loser!<br /><br />The 1988 Odessa Permian High School football team is followed for the year. Their trial and tribulations are documented to see what it takes for the quest of a championship ring. Four seniors take to the field for their final football season. The quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), Wide receiver Don Billingsley (Garret Hedlund), Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) and running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) The state football championship is in their sights. And nothing less will suffice. Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thorton) is given advice from past players and boosters who actually won championships from previous years. And they will settle for nothing less than the championship ring.<br /><br />"Friday Night Lights" is filmed with in your face football action. The realistic action sequences bring this film to life. This leads to one drawback.  The film starts to focus more on the action scenes then bringing out the quality dramas that exist between the characters. The stress to perform for a city, players and parents could have been more developed. But Tim McGraw (Charles Billingsley) as the drunken parent of wide receiver Don Billingsley puts in a quality performance.<br /><br />Being from a small town myself I can relate to high school sports being on the front page of everyone. A state championship year can keep that expectation high for years to come. What if? This DVD is a quality football must see!</p></body></html>

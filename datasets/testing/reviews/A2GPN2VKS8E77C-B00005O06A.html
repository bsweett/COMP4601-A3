<meta name="summary" content="Classic Masterpiece. Timeless Archive Of American History. Orson Welles' Debut-A Masterstroke Of Pure Genius. A MUST-SEE!!!"></head><body><p>Orson Welles' film debut is nothing less than a masterstroke of pure genius. A modern "Tragicall Historie Of Dr. Faustus" (written by Christopher Marlowe; the play, NOT THE MOVIE), this deeply sentimental portrait of lost love is remarkable not only for its thematic elements, but for the camerawork (considered revolutionary in 1941; expertly shot by Gregg Toland, who had worked on the successful "Wuthering Heights" two years earlier). This film deserves to be seen not just by film students, but by everyone. What a shame that this film was not a box-office hit upon its initial release in 1941. The only movie over which Orson Welles had complete creative control (he was subjected to his films being severely re-edited and reshot, most notably "The Magnificent Ambersons,"<br /><br />"Macbeth," "Othello, Moor Of Venice" and "Touch Of Evil," among others, for the remainder of his career), this film remains his best. Not Rated.</p></body></html>

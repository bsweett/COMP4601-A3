<meta name="summary" content="Blu Ray - A Strong Improvement"></head><body><p>Snatch is one of my all time favorite films.  He took the brilliant creativity and character development of Lock Stock and used a huge budget to make a dazzling film.  Too bad his magic was lost on subsequent films.  That notwithstanding, the Blu Ray is great.  Its a strong, but not huge, improvement over the original.  The video quality is very good, but much of Snatch was filmed in such a manner that aspects of the Blu Ray quality are unattainable (gritty scenes, overcast scenes (it is Britain), etc.).  However, I am impressed.  I would recommend, though, that you be a fairly devoted Snatch fan to justify upgrading your copy to Blu Ray.</p></body></html>

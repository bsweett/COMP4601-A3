<meta name="summary" content="Into the Underground"></head><body><p>This film takes us not into the Underground of the famous London Tube, but rather into the underbelly of society with the Russian mob.  A dead body has tatoos of stars on its knees and the Scotland Yard Russian expert says it is the mark of the Vory V Zakone, the Russian mafia, and means "he will never kneel".  We have been thrust into this world in the violent opening moments of the film, and soon Anna (Naomi Watts), a young Midwife of Russian descent working in a London hospital will find herself accidentally enmeshed in that same incredibly dangerous world.<br /><br />A tragic incident and good intentions cause Anna to cross paths with the violent villains of the Russian underworld, most especially the cooly enigmatic Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), ostensible chauffeur but obviously something much more lethal, the ebulliant Kirill (Vincent Cassel), explosive and unpredictable son of Semoyan (Armin Mueller-Stahl), patriarchal and genial restaurateur whose overt civility cannot completely disguise a sinister undertone that even the somewhat naive Anna recognizes.<br /><br />Ably directed by David Cronenberg with his usual invention, the look and atmosphere of the film is incredibly dense.  He takes us fully into this world, and he is greatly aided by the fine performances of his actors.  Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai has the presence of a coiled snake, wrapped tight and severely restrained and disciplined but ready to strike at any moment.  It is nuanced and subtle performance.  Cassell is fine as the troubled and dangerous son.  Naomi Watts can do no wrong for my money.  And Armin Mueller-Stahl is completely marvelous and chilling as a man of many parts, masking a ruthless pragmatist capable of anything.<br /><br />Cronenberg does violence with graphic cruelty, and there are several brief but harsh scenes with grisly detail.  The already famous fight scene in the baths with a naked Mortensen battling knife wielding assassins is a directorial tour de force.  But this violence glimpsed early on lends an atmosphere of menace and dread throughout the film that is appropriate.  The audience, like Anna, does not live in this world and once involved with it, reluctantly or not, fear is the order of the day.<br /><br />The film has a twist or two along the way, and the arc of the relationship between Anna and Nikolai is nicely done and makes sense to the story, yet we wish for more.  And it is perhaps an irony that adhering to the logic of the story and the world depicted results in the little something missing other reviewers have noted that somehow turns this from a classic to a very good film. A good story can read better than it plays. I admire the fact that the film kept its integrity and didn't go for an audience pleasing sell-out, and yet and yet... Well worthwhile, this is a very tough and fine film executed with expertise in all departments.</p></body></html>

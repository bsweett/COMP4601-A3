<meta name="summary" content="Not good"></head><body><p>The Darjeeling Limited is not a bad film, and nowhere near one of the all time worst films. But, in no way, shape, nor form, can anyone who understands and appreciates the art of cinema call this a good, much less great film, and those who have praised it or claimed it was one of the best films of its year are idiots, pure and simple. It is, in a sense, the sine qua non of mediocrity, and Anderson is the same thing in the realm of directors, which only begs the question as to what The Criterion Collection finds so valuable about his cinematic canon. More than that, I get the real sense, given Anderson's comments on the audio commentary track, and in the extra features, that he is not even trying to grow and make films of substance and quality any longer. And this is a shame, because Rushmore, the first film of his to break big, was a good film, and one which showed potential for Anderson to become a valuable asset for American cinema. In fact, only David Gordon Green's debut film, George Washington, showed more potential for a young American filmmaker, in the last dozen years, yet he too has stagnated, although his problem is more based in mere selling out to Hollywood and its conventions, whereas Anderson seems to be just creatively dead. Given his working and personal relationship with Roman Coppola- who's proven he's a good screenwriter, it would seem that Coppola would be the person to turn to for his next film's screenplay; to get outside of Andersonworld. If not, he may be doomed to becoming his generation's Tim Burton; a thought even scarier than any of that perpetual juvenile's own films.</p></body></html>

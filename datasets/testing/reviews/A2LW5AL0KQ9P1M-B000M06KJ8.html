Since I have an interest in "historically inspired" work and the controversy which surrounds it (think Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783231202">Amistad</a>, Lee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002ND77">Malcolm X</a>, Stone's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDL93">JFK</a> etc...), I felt compelled to watch Coppola's film. So, I released a burdensome sigh when I dropped this DVD in the player ... then, I stared at the "two hours and two minutes" stamp with an expression of pain. Within minutes, I was completely riveted ...<br /><br />Coppola's work is masterful. The mise en sc&egrave;ne is breathtaking. Coppola's design-training (always evident in her work) is in full bloom: each frame is its own work of art. (And, until now, I have never seen the garishness of Versailles as beautiful). I was charmed by the artist's attention to the most minute detail. As if taking a cue from her cinematographer for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXH1">The Virgin Suicides</a> (Edward Lachman), Coppola uses pale pinks and blues to emphasize Marie Antoinette's innocence (although Dunst was in her twenties, remember that Marie Antoinette was a mere fourteen years-old when sent to France). After an affair with Count Fersen, the queen's  infidelity is emphasized by a scarlet belt (very clever). The lushness of the film cannot be conveyed with words ...<br /><br />The acting is sublime. While I have never cared for the roles into which Dunst is usually thrust (save <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RFFS">Interview with the Vampire</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXH1">The Virgin Suicides</a>), this role is pure perfection. Dunst brings warmth and vulnerability to a much maligned historical figure. Moreover, Schwartzman is both compelling and amusing in his role as Louis XVI ... he, too, is wildly sympathetic as a "child-king" (only twenty years-old) ... "God help us. We are too young to reign."<br /><br />Coppola never intended to create a work faithful to history. Why should she? Anyone can flip to The History Channel or PBS to see that. Instead,  Coppola grants us the portrait of a frightened child ... with the hopes of France and Austria pinned to her frilly dress ... trying to navigate a tangle of tradition ... very much alone.<br /><br />Two hours and two minutes passed in a flash of decadence and heartbreak. After viewing Coppola's junior project, I can hardly await her next film. This is a phenomenal effort and a phenomenal success. Thank you Coppola for such a beautiful film!<br /><br />Suggested reading:<br />Fraser, Antonia. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307277747">Marie Antoinette: The Journey</a>.

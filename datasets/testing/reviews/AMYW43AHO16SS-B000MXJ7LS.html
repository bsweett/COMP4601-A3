<meta name="summary" content="Oliver Stone Keeps It Real!"></head><body><p>When Oliver Stone makes movies of historical value, he tends to exagerate the facts (i.e. JFK, Salvador, Midnight Express).  In this film, he completely stays out of delivering negative propaganda on who was responsible and focuses on the ordeal and rescue of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe&ntilde;a).  The result is a movie that all viewers would be proud of.  The film was made with courage and sympathy to the victims.  Some viewers may be put off by the intensity of the subject matter, due to the film being too soon to watch.  This film is very much needed in this day and age in hopes that the events of September 11th, 2001 are never forgotten.</p></body></html>

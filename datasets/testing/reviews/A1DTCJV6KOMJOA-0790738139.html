Even though the film is in color the drap texture and cinematography works wonders on the screen and the disc is a great transfer of a great film. The true star of the film is not Crowe though he is great. The raw power he exudes is mesmerizing! Not a great deal was paid attention to the films anti-hero, the guy who's presence makes every scene pop with an understated intelligence. His name is GUY PEARCE! This is his film and he knows it any guy that can take a scene from Crowe has to be good.This film won some Oscars but the one who stand out for a win is Basinger; for an actor who usually does ... her performance is a sleek as her hair! But why was Pearce not a best actor nominee and Crowe they bothe lost that year-and Pearce wasn't even nominated. Buy this film and do yourself a favor.</p></body></html>

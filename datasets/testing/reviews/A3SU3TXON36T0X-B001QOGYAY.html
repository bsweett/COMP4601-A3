<meta name="summary" content="Murder and the Afterlife."></head><body><p>_Lovely Bones_ (2010) is a fairly good movie about a horrible tragedy and the afterlife.  The movie features very vivid and impressive scenes of the afterlife.  The movie involves a young girl whose life is brutally taken by a serial killer and the attempt to right the wrong of this great evil.  The girl becomes a ghost trapped in a purgatory between here and there until her soul and remains are laid to rest.  The film shows the struggles of her family to come to terms with her brutal murder (although the reactions of some of the family members seem somewhat superficial, particularly the grandmother).  The girl exists as a ghost in a beautiful and lush paradise along with the souls of those who were also killed by this evil man.  Ultimately, after much ordeal the father comes to suspect the real killer and attempts to bring him to justice because the police no longer take the situation seriously.  The sister of the girl sneaks into his house and discovers a lock of hair from her sister and thus attains the necessary "evidence" the family so strongly desires.  However, before the police can arrive the killer manages to escape just before he tosses the remains of the girl into a sinkhole where she can be buried forever.  I felt it was unfortunate however that in the end the killer will not have to face the justice of man but only falls prey to a sort of cosmic justice (and presumably justice in the afterlife).  The movie features beautiful scenes and imagery and shows us a view of the afterlife that is perhaps different from what some have come to expect.  I felt it was a good film but very brutal and depressing, though in the end the wrong appears to be righted (somehow).</p></body></html>

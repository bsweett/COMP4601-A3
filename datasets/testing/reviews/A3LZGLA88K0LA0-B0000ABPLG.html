<meta name="summary" content="HOW DO YOU FEEL?"></head><body><p>Kurt Wimmer's stark, violent cautionary tale is set after WWIII.  Citizens are being controlled by a drug which stifles their emotions.  The government feels that without emotions, there will be no wars, no murders; they think emotions are a handicap, and they use clerics to uphold the law.  Anyone showing emotion is either killed on the spot or incinerated later.  No trials, nothing.  Of course, this means all things like literature, music, etc., are banned.<br />Christian Bale stars as the highest ranking &quot;Cleric&quot;, who enforces the law dictated by Father (Sean Pertwee).  Early in the film, Bale's partner (Sean Bean) shows evidence of having feelings, and when Bales finds him reading the poetry of Yeats, he is forced to kill him.<br />His new partner (an appropriately sniveling Taye Diggs) is excited to work with Bales, but at the same time he is more in mind.  Angus McFayden plays the chief of council, whose agenda is also more than meets the eye.<br />Bales finally decides to stop taking the daily drug doseages and is rewarded with feelings----and a threat to his life and career.<br />The battle sequences are awesome in their fluidity and imagination.  Bales and Emily Watson as doomed Mary O'Brien, are particularly good, and the movie is quite original in its take of Fahrenheit 451.<br />Gloomy yet impressive.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Characters. Film LOOKS fantastic."></head><body><p>American History X stands on its own as a great piece of powerhouse performing by all the cast involved, including - Norton, Furlong, Keach, Brooks, D'Angelo and Gould. Essentially the story is about Derek (Norton) who plays an ex-Nazi gang leader who undergoes rehabilitation while in prison where he gets to experience the cons of his fascism. The film tells his story through the eyes of his brother (Furlong) who must write a paper for his principle on his brother's life as punishment for writing an essay on Adolf Hitler. <p>The film poses a number of great questions and answers many of them, although we will never actually get to see the REAL American History X because Kaye was locked out of the editing room, by Hollywood executives and Norton, in an attempt to control Norton's content on the screen and to give it a Hollywood flavor which can be seen throughout the picture when Norton does the sudden U-Turn with the Nazi brother and suddenly become "good guys" almost overnight. Yes, it is hard to believe at times and certainly there is a lot to spoon down in that department, but overall the film is certainly very good and plays out well even if the story is a bit contrived at times, however you will LOVE the cinematography that Kaye produces on the screen and this film does indeed look lush in its color, black and white, slow motion sequences. <p>Definitely a picture worth looking at - to look at, and although the story does have a lot of impact it might be a little artificial in a Hollywood sort of way at times. Pitty Kaye was not allowed the reigns all the way through to the finish.</p></body></html>

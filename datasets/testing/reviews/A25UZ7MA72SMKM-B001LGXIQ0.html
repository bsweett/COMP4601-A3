Those laughs are probably the biggest if you spot them.<br /><br />What can you say about Steve Carell? In remakes of this type it is easy for the movie actor to come up short of the legend created out of the popular TV role. (Will Smith as James West anyone?) As much as I enjoyed Don Adams in the TV series, Steve Carell one up's him and is a better Maxwell Smart than Adams was.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway obviously studied Barbara Feldon's Agent 99 quite a bit, because there are lines in the movie where you could swear that a younger Feldon had been plugged in. She's spot on in the role.<br /><br />The movie pays homage to Don Adam's most famous repeat bits without overdoing it one bit. The story is engaging, and the action is very well done, although you'll struggle to recognize that because they don't let up on the comedy accelerator even in the middle of action scenes that would be the most tense in any other film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray redition of the film is a delight to watch. I don't go through special features often, so I won't comment on those, altho we did watch the outtake/gag reel and it was worth the time spent to watch it ... twice.<br /><br />We have now watched this film several times as we played it for ourselves, and then various sets of family and friends. We enjoy it just as much with each repeated viewing ... a solid accomplishment for any film, and even more so for a comedy.<br /><br />Obviously, if you like comedies this is highly recommeneded. If you were a fan of the Get Smart TV series, its must see.</p></body></html>

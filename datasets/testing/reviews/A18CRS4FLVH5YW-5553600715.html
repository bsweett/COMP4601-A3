<meta name="summary" content="The effective creepy summer sleeper!"></head><body><p>Every summer I have serious expectations for a great summer sleeper film that no one knows about but ends up being box office success.  &quot;The Others,&quot; is this summers sleeper!  Like &quot;Ghost,&quot; &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; this movie follows in that tradition of bringing to the screen atmosphere and substance rather than hokey special effects and cheap thrills.  The thrills in this movie are far from cheap.  Each scene in &quot;The Others,&quot; builds with a slow gradual pace much like what Kubrick did with &quot;The Shining.&quot;  Nicole Kidman provides quite possibly the best performance of her career and I would go as far to say loosely &quot;Oscar!&quot;  All the characters are truly superb and effective, the story striking and intense and the scenery is ultimately dark and creepy, especially the scene where Nicole Kidman gets lost in &quot;the fog.&quot;  If you want a true spooky ghost story, this is the one to see, along with the forthcoming &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; which opens in theatres August 31st.  Cheers!</p></body></html>

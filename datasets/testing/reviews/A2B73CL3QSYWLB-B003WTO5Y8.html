Essentially, he made his name with off-beat comedies prior to this("Handle With Care", "Melvin and Howard", "Something Wild", "Married to the Mob").  It was probably a blessing that someone like him directed this film because despite the darkness of the material, he handles it in a non-exploitative manner.  The story concerns a manhunt for a serial kidnapper-killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who preys on girls of a certain body-weight, most recently the daughter of a U.S. Senator.  One of the FBI investigators is a young female trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who utilizes an imprisoned cannibal psychiatrist, Hannibal Lector(Anthony<br /><br /> Hopkins) in her search for Buffalo Bill.  Despite the fact that Lecter repells her, Starling continues to utilize him because of his invaluable insight into the inner workings of the criminal mindset.  Foster is excellent in her Oscar-winning role as Starling.  Hopkins is creepily seductive as Lecter.  It's unfortunate that he made a parody of this character in two repellant sequels, "Hannibal" and "Red Dragon".  Solid work is also delivered here by Levine, Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford, Starling's superior, and Anthony Heald as the disagreeable head of the mental hospital housing Lecter, Dr. Chilton.</p></body></html>

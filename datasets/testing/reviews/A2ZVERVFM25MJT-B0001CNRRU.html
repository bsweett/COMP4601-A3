And it pretty much lives up to the good things people have been saying about it.  Directed by the man behind Amores Perros, you can immediately tell from the way this is filmed that it's not a typical Hollywood melodrama.  The colours are bleached out and the time out of synch.  However, this doesn't mean 21 Grams doesn't have something in common with such films.  The centrepiece of the story is a terrible accident that affects the movie's other characters.  Watching the movie at first is slightly confusing, as it shows us glimpses of things that are yet to happen in the longer sections.  This technique has been used by various directors, notably Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan.  Yet it is the latter director with which 21 Grams shares so much, particularly his little seen first independent affair, Following, which also had very short clips from the future to break up the drama of the main story.  The scenes used for this come across as short exclamations of passion and horror; a dying man covered in blood, a post-coital cigarette and a woman taking drugs in a bathroom.  Whilst it's true that if it weren't for these scenes the movie might be shown as the pretty simplistic drama that it is, this doesn't make it any less compelling or any less good.  For anyone's who's seen the Australian movie Lantana, this will certainly ring a few bells.<p>What makes the movie though, besides the almost poetic direction, are the performances.  Sean Penn got a lot of credit for his role and deservedly so, though the rest of the cast also give nuanced and complex performances.  Benicio del Toro is superb as the heavy-religious ex-con, depicting a whole range of anger and self-loathing behind his furrowed brows.  In addition, Naomi Watts really comes into her own as the lonely woman falling apart.  It would have been easy to give a shouty, tear-stained performance, but she really lends a desperation to this that is tangible.<p>Any other year, 21 Grams would have probably sweeped the Oscars, were it not for the phenomenal success and achievement Peter Jackson demonstrated with The Return Of The King.  Whilst it's true to say that in hindsight it's not really as good as it would perhaps like to be, nor as original, it's still a brilliant movie in its own right and one that any fan of intelligent, adult cinema should try to see.</p></body></html>

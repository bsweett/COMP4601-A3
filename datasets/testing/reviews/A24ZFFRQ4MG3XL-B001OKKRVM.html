There are no big stars in this, just thousands of the cutest most beautiful little guys you could think of.  They are amazing animals and this depicts the life cycle of them and the way they live facing brutally cold conditions, attacks by seals, and the heartbreak they suffer (like humans) when chicks die or are taken from them.  This is brilliant and unlike any other documentary I've seen.  It captivated me from start to end and it's a must see.  Listening to Morgan Freemans soothing voice is so pleasant and he was easily the best choice to narrate this.  Go see this.  I highly, highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

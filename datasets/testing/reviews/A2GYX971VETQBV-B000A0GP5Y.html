Rather than live in the shadow of the original film, THE LONGEST YARD manages to set up a decent comedy of its own, despite being formulaic and cheesy at times.<br /><br />By now, you should be very familiar with the plot: Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) is a former NFL star, who was indicted for throwing a game and has been recently picked up for reckless driving.  He gets the opportunity to round up a bunch of prison misfits to form a "prisoner" football team, set to go head-to-head with the prison guards.  Crewe's rag-tag bunch does remarkably well and the warden of the prison begins to worry about his chances of winning.  In turn, Crewe is faced with a moral dilemma: throw the game again and save his skin or play the game and risk his life.<br /><br />THE LONGEST YARD is the very definition of a formula comedy, but I still managed to eek out some entertainment from it.  The supporting cast is really quite superb if you take a close look at it.  While the not the greatest film I've seen all year, it does provide the people with exactly what they want: mind-numbing entertainment.  Just don't spend $20 on it.  Trust me.  You won't like it that much.</p></body></html>

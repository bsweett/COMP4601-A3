<meta name="summary" content="It Twists, it turns...."></head><body><p>"Derailed" stars Jennifer Aniston(Lucinda) and Clive Owen(Charles) as two commuters who meet on a train one day when Charles misses his usual train.<br /><br />They develop an attraction and eventually take it to the next level. In the trashy hotel room they rent, someone breaks in and Charles' life is literally 'derailed'.  The guy rapes Lucinda, beats the crap out of Charles, and the plot thickens.  Believe me, it does, it adds texture to what could have been an otherwise drab imitation of a Hitchcock thriller.<br />It's a good rental if you are fan of the genre.<br />I thought the performances were fine and was intrigued by it up until the final frame of the movie.  Good twists and turns help this movie along.<br /><br />Eileen F.</p></body></html>

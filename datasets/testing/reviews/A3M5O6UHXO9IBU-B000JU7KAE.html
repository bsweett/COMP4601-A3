As one has largely incorporated the other I'm not sure there's really a distinction, although it may help him to weather the low box office returns of 'Lady' with pride. You can never truly straddle two worlds, just ask Story. As a matter of interest, most of the fifteen or twenty matinee attendees with me were older patrons. That may be why another cinema had abandoned all but evening performances.<br /><br />'Lady' reminded me of the children's book 'Marianne Dreams' coupled with my least favourite Tarkovsky, 'Stalker'. The latter featuring a guide whose followers had to perform ritualistic and puzzling tasks to get to a destination in a roundabout way, avoiding traps more metaphysical than manifest. "Periously close to hocus pocus", lamented one critic at the time. Sounds familiar?<br /><br />The media studies self critique running throughout is a distraction as the constant ambiguity (special pleading or unbridled confidence?) remains unresolved. Also, quaint is the notion that in the age of Internet blogs and other sites in which thousands of opinions about society and political figures are poured over, "in a few years time" a book will capture the imagination of one figure and through him, the multitudes. Haven't books by prophets and radical thinkers cost enough lives? Try telling the hundreds of millions of Muslims to stop reading the Koran and take up 'The Cookbook'.<br /><br />Far from being original, the film's New Age, get in touch with your inner child sentiments are dated and have been overtaken by events, as the saying goes. If the director's contention that multi-cultural America has no sense of community, self-knowledge or direction is correct then the United Sates better get its act together quickly because it has plenty of enemies who do know and the will to do something about it. The hope that after climbing out of the water, man's endless fight over land and religion will be abandoned in favour of some third way that the director does not even have the courage of his convictions to reveal is a forlorn one.<br /><br />On a brighter note, I thought the director's acting performance was respectable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Different from the book at the end but still a good movie!"></head><body><p>The army's "Arrowhead Project" has poked a hole into another dimension and it may be open for good. A massive and violent thunderstorm pounds a small town in Maine and does tremendous damage. David Drayton (Thomas Jane) takes his young son and his neighbor into town to get supplies and to see what is going on as the power is out. While at the grocery/hardware store an all obscuring mist rolls in and takes visibility to zero. The store is full of customers and a man runs in screaming that there is something in the mist. A man who goes outside is heard screaming and the customers close the doors of the store and prepare for the worst.<br /><br />The customers separate into 3 main groups, those who want to leave, those who want to stay inside and a group forms around a fanatic telling everyone it is the end of days. The store's generator shuts down and a clerk goes out to fix it and he is killed by a monster that attacks. A few try to leave but they either disappear into the mist or are heard screaming as they die....<br /><br />Stephen King's imagination runs wild in this story and the result is a very good storyline full of terrifying creatures let loose into this world. I am a Stephen King fan and own just about everything the man has written and I loved this story.<br /><br />Unfortunately the director and screen writers take liberties with the storyline and change the ending to create some closure that the novella didn't do. I feel that the ending of the movie is just too sad and for me I did not enjoy the movie as well as I enjoyed the book. It is still worth watching but just be aware that if you read the book that the movie is different.<br /><br />This movie features great special effects and they are right out of Stephen King's imagination. That part of the movie follows the book pretty well and I enjoyed it. The acting is very good and I even wanted to shoot Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who is the main leader of the fanatic group.<br /><br />Watch this movie; you will like it if you like Stephen King!</p></body></html>

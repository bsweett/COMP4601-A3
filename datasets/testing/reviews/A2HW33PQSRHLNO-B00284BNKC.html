As a lifelong fan of oddball, disturbing and surreal films of all variety, I would say this ranks in the top ten in terms of sheer unpleasantness.  And that's saying a lot. I remember hearing about this movie quite a bit<br />when it was released and writing it off as another "Basketball Diaries", and that's what I expected when I popped it in my DVD player.  Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />But the unpleasantness is not gratuitous; in fact, Arofonsky has done everyone a service by translating Shelby's book into film in such a visceral and brutal manner. The performances are appropriately desperate and the actors themselves mean a lot less than what they are intended to represent: surrender, through different means, to the forces of self-destruction, narcissism, and ultimate disintegration.  One thing, though; Jennifer Connelly's character Marion would not be looking as good as she does at the end of the film at all if she was such a fervent heroin user.<br /><br />Otherwise, there is not one false note in this hellish descent into the pits of human degradation and nothing is too extreme.  Anyone who has experienced addiction in their lives will recognize from the first scene in which Harry boosts his mother's television set that while a lot of the Kafkaesque and bleakly surreal are employed here, it is all too real.  For better or worse, I will never forget this movie, and it stands as one of the most successfully realized films I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

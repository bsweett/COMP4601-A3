<meta name="summary" content="Bloated Hollywood take on Dan's Brown's violent Vatican thriller"></head><body><p>Ron Howard has led a team of who's who in Hollywood to crank out another one of the town's patented "Must-Be Blockbusters."  In times of yore, Hollywood would crank out "must-see" movies that were so good that, if you missed them, you felt like the village idiot.  Now, however, when an author writes a smash hit (and Dan Brown's "Angels & Demons" surely qualifies), Hollywood invests hundreds of millions buying and adapting the book into a movie, leaving no expense unspent in its quest to crank out a sure-fire smash hit.  So expensive are these movies that they become products of a thousand hands, trying to maximize the tickets sold rather than just tell the darn story as well as the author did the first time.<br /><br />And so it is that "Angels & Demons" hit the big screen and went away without raising so much as an eyebrow.  This non-essential film is satisfied to hit the necessary high points of the book within the time allotted (no three-hour movie here - we have to get enough screenings per day on 3,000 multiplexes).  All the marks are hit - Tom Hanks is the acting royalty in the lead, Ron Howard is behind the camera, and top-notch screenwriters, composers, cinematographers, and make-up staff on on the scene, probably down to the top Key Grip in the industry.  But the movie progresses from scene to scene without generating a hint of tension or interest, and when the final credits roll you wonder, what was the point?<br /><br />"A&D" tells a dark, sinister, thrilling story.  A dangerous quasi-religious sect has kidnapped four candidates for the papacy after the death of the beloved Pope.  Proclaiming vengeance for the Catholic Church's repugnant persectuion of scientists over the centuries, the Illuminati promise to murder these priests along with blowing up half of Rome with antimatter.  Dr. Robert Langdon (Hanks) is whisked away from the Harvard swimmming pool to save the HQ of Christendom, which is a little strange because everyone in the Church heirarchy is still mad at him over the recent events in Paris in "The Da Vinci Code."<br /><br />A pell-mell race against time ensues, but one that unfortunately skims over the coolest aspect of the book - Dan Brown's explanations of the various symbols hiding in plain sight throughout the Vatican.  Hanks remains Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors.  But it gets tiresome that he rubs up against movie stars in every conceivable role, or if they aren't movie stars then they are clearly in the "Hey, It's That Guy" club.  Remember the scene at the end of "The Player," when the movie that was supposed to be made "with no stars" eventually becomes a bloated mess starring Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, and every well-known supporting actor in Hollywood?  That's "A&D" in a nutshell.<br /><br />I saw an interview with Tom Hanks where he talked about filming "A&D."  Like Mel Brooks saying, "It's good to be the king," Hanks waxed nostaligic about sitting at a sidewalk cafe in Rome waiting for the filmmakers to get a scene set up.  I think we can all agree that Hanks likely had a terrific time making this movie.  It doesn't mean that you're going to have a great time watching it.<br /><br />The only thing that is truly terrific about this movie is its capturing of the beauty and majesty that can be found in Rome and the Vatican.  Statues, domes, fountains, and even cobbled streets shine with a divine glory everywhere you look.  For that alone, the movie is recommended.<br /><br />But if you want a thrill ride through Rome and the Vatican, courtesy of the murderous Illuminati, I suggest you just read Dan Brown's book.  You will see what the movie missed.</p></body></html>

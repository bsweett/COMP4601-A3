<meta name="summary" content="Featuring a young actress with a LOT of promise!"></head><body><p>Based on Alice Sebold's 2002 novel of the same name, this movie by New Zealand's Peter Jackson tells the alternatingly haunting and uplifting story of Suzie Salmon, a young girl murdered by a neighbor in the early 1970's.  In death, Suzie watches her family from above as they deal in various ways with her disappearance.  I haven't read the book, but I have learned that it is much more graphic and intricate than the film version.<br /><br />Lead actress Saoirse Ronan plays Susie, and Miss Ronan is a true find!  She carries this film, which is no small feat considering how often it teeters toward being both maudlin and saccharine in its depiction of "the in-between", the not-quite-Heaven zone in which she finds herself after she dies.  She doesn't achieve access to Heaven until her murder has reached some sort of closure in real life.<br /><br />For all its flaws (the often overly-fanciful effects work) this film mostly works.  The acting is very good all across the board.  What was most interesting to me was that it veers from genre formula by not engaging in last-minute heroics in one particular scene near the end.  As a viewer, you root for the villain's deeds to be discovered at a particular moment.  Instead, it takes a heart-breaking turn toward sadness and disappointment which is almost immediately erased in favor of a somewhat ethereal optimism  --  Suzie is perhaps less concerned with seeing her murderer meet justice than we are  --  she has different priorities at that possible moment of revelation.  We want to see justice, but Suzie is still trying to find her joy. ["Huh?  What?"  Just go with me on this one.  You'll understand when you see it.]  Suzie is not interested in seeing justice served.  Her goal is loftier --  to allow her family, her father in particular, to let go of her and live free of the exquisite pain of her loss.  [Or something like that  -- just watch the damn thing]<br /><br />The film was not a huge success at the box office and received more than its fair share of negative reviews (notably from those who disapproved of its absence of religious themes).  But as a stand-alone experience, it is quite unique and worth the trip.</p></body></html>

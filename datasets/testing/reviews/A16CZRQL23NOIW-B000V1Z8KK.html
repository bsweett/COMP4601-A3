<meta name="summary" content="Someone must clean the nastiness !"></head><body><p>The thriller genre has really achieved a prominent space where Tightrope (1994), and Absolute power (1997), found into the unsaid scandals behind stages a propitious opportunity to show the audiences new visions around erroneous tactics of Defense around an enigma that concerns us, from extreme to extreme around the world: the insatiable thirst of oil.<br /><br />And so, a well trained shooter will be the chosen prey, for a very zealously elaborated macabre murder, to create an opinion's matrix around his culpability. But this smart strategy ignored what the human factor can do, once the critical point has been reached.<br /><br />The well rounded script, the superb cast that includes the best performance of Mark Wahlberg in his lifetime and a fabulous direction effort make of this thriller the best of the year, after "Michael Clayton".<br /><br />Kudos !</p></body></html>

Viewing Proof last nite, I couldn't help wishing someone else had played Catherine other than Paltrow.  I thought Paltrow was a bit over the top actually in the role.  Paltrow and Gyllenhaal had nothing together in terms of "on screen" chemistry.  As much as I am trying to put my finger on what the problem was with this pitiful film, I have to admit that it was just about everything. The story did not flow at all. The dialogue did not work. Casting was poor. The sister of Paltrow was just ridiculous.  'd go on about how this film was excellent and get more in depth about this motion picture, but Gwyneth Paltrow ruined it, so I will save my typing and leave it at that.</p></body></html>

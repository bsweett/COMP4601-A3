Alan Rickman is also great as the great stage actor wannabe stuck in rubber makeup repeating a signature line he hates.  Sigourney Weaver plays against type as the show's bubble headed computer-repeating eye candy.  She does this very well.  Tony Shaloub brings his special gift for characterization to this very laid back Tech Sgt Chen.  His performance is one of the most fun in the film.  <p>This was the movie I first noticed Sam Rockwell and his role as Guy Fleegman is memorable because it is done so perfectly.  The Thermians are wonderfully done aliens who believe the TV signals they picked up were historical documents and set about making the fake sets and space ships into real space ships and transporters.  <p>What a cool idea.  Enrico Colantoni brings surprising depth to Mathesar, who could have been a simple cartoon.  The same is true for Patrick Breen, Missi Pyle, and Jed Rees.  Robin Sacs goes over the top as Sarris and that is exactly what is required for ole lobster head.  And Jeremy Howard brings Kyle to life as a teen who is smart enough to know more about the Galaxy Quest show than the people who made it, but is still kid enough to accept the show almost as the Thermians do.<p>I just have to say that I find every scene in this movie a delight, including the continuity problems and plot flaws, just like the show it is parodying.  I mean, who cares when you are having this much fun.</p></body></html>

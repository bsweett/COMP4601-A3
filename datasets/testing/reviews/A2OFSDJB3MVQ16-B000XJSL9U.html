<meta name="summary" content="Almost the best "Die Hard" sequel yet--close to the original"></head><body><p>When I heard that there was going to a 4th "Die Hard" installment to the franchise--my heart sank!! Why? Because the last 2 sequels were pale repeats of the original premise with slight modifications in the plot like the hi-jacking of a plane or the threat of bombs blowing up in NYC.  The franchise seemed burned out and of course Willis himself was getting long in the tooth for these shenanigans!!  But lo and behold we get a re-boot in a plausible story line of how a disavowed  or disgrunted government worker creates a "fire sale" by hacking in on the main computers in the nation.  How's that for originality which was lacking in the sequels?  Also for once Willis is not such a super-hero like he was in the sequels and gets help from computer hacker Justin Long (that "Apple guy" in the commercials)--they are a perfect pair.  Though the villain, Timothy Olliyphant isn't engaging as Alan Rickman was in the original, there's plenty of knock-out action to compensate.  Also the Blu-ray transfer is excellent so definitely get this one for sure.</p></body></html>

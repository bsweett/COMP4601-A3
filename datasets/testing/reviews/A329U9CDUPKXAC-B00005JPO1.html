Well, I was never an Indiana fan and I never watched any of the previous movies. At least, not all the way through. So this was really my first movie to the series and I thought it was a lot of fun. The alien thing was kinda weird but it didn't stop me from liking the movie. So stop hating.</p></body></html>

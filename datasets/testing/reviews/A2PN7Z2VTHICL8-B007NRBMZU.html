<meta name="summary" content="The worlds fade as time slides past us"></head><body><p>For such an intriguing subject as `time travel' (using the term loosely), there are very few stories, much less movies, that can carry off the subject with an interesting approach.  `The Butterfly Effect' falls into the rank of excellence along with the movie `Donnie Darko' and the book `Replay' by Ken Grimwood.<br /><br />Evan Treborn (played surprisingly well by Aston Kutcher) has been plagued by strange memory blackouts throughout his childhood, usually occurring at traumatic times in his life.  And Evan's life is ripe with trauma.  He and his friends Kayleigh Miller (a showcase role for Amy Smart) and Lenny Kegan (Elden Henson) must deal with the problems from their childhood as they grow into adults.  For Evan, his problems are made worse by the fact that his father is insane and in a psychiatric hospital, and Evan has never met him.  When Evan does meet his father, his father tries to choke him and is killed, but Evan can't remember why because of a blackout.<br /><br />Later, while in college and free from his blackouts for over seven years, something strange happens to Evan while he is glancing through his old journals.  Spurred by this incident to try and find out more about his past, Evan visits his old friends Kayleigh and Lenny to question them.  Lenny is disturbed and still lives at home building models, and Kayleigh is working as a waitress, scarred too deep on the inside to make a better life for herself.  When Evan is informed of Kayleigh's suicide by her brutal and psychotic brother, he decides to harness the strangeness that comes from reading his journals.<br /><br />Evan finds he can go back, travel into his childhood, into the dead places left by his blacked out memory, and attempts to save Kayleigh in this way.  What follows is a taut and thrilling roller coaster ride in which for every fix Evan attempts, he changes the entire course of his life and the lives of his friends.  And before its too late, Evan needs to find a way to fix everyone, even if it means losing the only girl he's ever loved.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher surprised me in this movie, moving from silly comedies to a serious role with a clean style and well displayed talent.  The role of Kayleigh for Amy Smart was perfect, giving her a wide variety of characterization to spiral through as Evan continues his pursuit to bring about the changes that will leave each of his friends in a better life.  Watch for Eric Stoltz as George Miller, Kayleigh's dad, in a shocking character that he performs with excellence.  More great supporting roles from Melora Walters as Evan's mom Andrea, Elden Henson as Lenny, and the perfectly done character of Thumper, played by the talented Ethan Suplee (John Q, Evolution).<br /><br />`The Butterfly Effect' is not an action packed thriller, but you will still be glued to your set, watching how events unfold in different and unexpected ways, adding twists now and than that will leave you changing your mind about certain characters and crossing your fingers for Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

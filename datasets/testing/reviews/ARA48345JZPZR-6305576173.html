I was going to make Espresso......"></head><body><p>Just watched this again for the umpteenth time and found myself still laughing at a classic comedy with some of the most memorable lines in any comedy.  It's been over 30 years and this gem is as good as when it was released.  Timeless.<br /><br />Look, by now everyone who loves movies should know this film.  One of those rare lightning-strikes wherein everything worked wonderfully and the casting created a perfect ensemble.  Hands down the best movie parody Mel Brooks ever made as well as the best looking and most completely consistent in design as well as style.<br /><br />I don't need to elaborate on story and production, but if you've never seen Young Frankenstein, what have you missed?  How about:<br /><br />"Walk this way.  No, no, this way."<br /><br />"Hump? What hump?"<br /><br />"Roll, roll, roll in ze hay."<br /><br />"Werewolf. There, there wolf."<br /><br />"Blucher!"<br /><br />"Brandy? Some varm milk...perhaps. Ovaltine!"<br /><br />"Put ze candle beck!"<br /><br />"Vollowing in his grandvaters vootstheps!"<br /><br />"Sedagive??!!"<br /><br />"Abbie Normal"<br /><br />"He vas my BOYFRIEND!"<br /><br />"Mmm,oh, you're a mute.  A very Big mute!"<br /><br />"You take the blonde, I'll take the one in the turban."<br /><br />"You little zipper-neck."<br /><br />"O sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!"<br /><br />Out of context, not much.  In context, hilarious.  And the cast!  Gene Wilder does demented, arrogant obsession like no one else.  Terri Garr is yummy.  Marty Feldman absolutely irreplaceable.  Peter Boyle marvelous.  Madeline Kahn the ultimate spoiled "princess". Cloris Leachman simply perfect in a small but indelible role. Ken Mars' Inspector is a personal favorite of mine (I have loved his thick German accent since The Producers, and he and Mel get in some jokes here about how some viewers of that film couldn't always understand what his Franz Liebkin was saying).  And last, but not least, the hysterical cameo by Gene Hackman as the Blind Hermit.<br /><br />Critics tend not to give 5 stars to comedies, probably because every joke doesn't work for everyone.  That is the nature of comedy.  Well that is true here as well, but it is one of the most consistently funny films from beginning to end you'll ever see.  And it is good-hearted, good-natured, and without a mean bone in its body.  Well worth your while.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gold Star for a Good Bond Film"></head><body><p>"Goldfinger" was the third movie in the Bond series.  This movie set the standard for the Bond genre, and is generally regarded as one of the best Bond films, if not the best.<p>Gadgetry goes high-tech in this movie, and will stay with Bond in every film from this point forward.  In this movie we have a cutting laser.  Very impressive technology for 1964 when the laser was still a very new device.  A lot of poetic license was used for this special effect since even visible light lasers can barely be seen under most circumstances, and high power cutting lasers can't be seen at all.<p>Sean Connery appears very confident in this film.  His style of Bond is well developed by this point and remains the standard by which all other actors playing Bond are measured.  Most men at some point in their lives (and perhaps some women too!) want to be the James Bond portrayed by Sean Connery in this movie.<p>There are some of the coolest gadgets in this movie.  The Aston-Martin DB-5 has to be the best.  Everyone needs a car with machine guns, a smoke screen and an ejection seat (which only covers a few of the neat features).  Apparently, you do not want an Aston-Martin near a Ford Mustang, as Tilly Masterson found out.  Oddjob's hat, while low tech, presaged the martial arts movies of the 70s.  The cargo plane with the Boeing 747 style front end was very interesting.  Goldfinger's model of Fort Knox was very good.  Goldfinger also provided the best way to get rid of a body in the 60s.  One detail I had missed on previous viewings of this movie was the license plate on Goldfinger's car.  How could I have missed that?<p>The first portion of the movie provides two pieces of information.  First, Goldfinger loves gold.  Second, Goldfinger has something going, but what?  The second portion of the movie begins when it's revealed that Goldfinger plans to attack Fort Knox.  Goldfinger would be very brave, or very stupid, to attack Fort Knox.  But even that's not the end of the plot.  Goldfinger plans on setting off a nuclear bomb in Fort Knox to contaminate the U.S. gold reserves, making Goldfinger's gold even more valuable.  I guess you can never be too rich.  Fortunately James Bond is in all the right places at all the right times, though he risks death more than once in the process.<p>The locales become more exotic with each Bond movie.  This time we get to go to Switzerland, England, and exotic Kentucky (well, Fort Knox is pretty exotic).  Being on location adds a lot of realism to these films.<p>Added to the film are a variety of extras that you get with the DVD.  As with any of these extras, some you'll find interesting, most not, but they come at no extra charge (other than having to pay more for the DVD than a VHS tape).<p>This movie is a lot of fun.  Grab yourself a bowl of popcorn, sit back and spend a couple of hours in a world and a time that may feel like long ago, but really isn't.</p></body></html>

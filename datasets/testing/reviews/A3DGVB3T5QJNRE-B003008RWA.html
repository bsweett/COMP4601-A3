The United States, the "Greatest Country In The World?" Hogwash! More like, "the best brainwashed" people in the world!"<br /><br />Other countries have their priorities straight, that is Canada, France, and even demonized "Third-World" Cuba! In the United States, where we pride ourselves for our "freedom" and "fair play," we tolerate a Heath Care system which gives hard-working, medically-insured, middle class people the freedom to die, in order to maximize corporate profits! And, God help you if you don't have Health Insurance in the United States - it's "fair play" to literally dump you in the front of a homeless shelter in a hospital gown while you're disoriented. I mean, you can't afford treatment so let the Catholic Church, or some other third party, play doctor at an emergency shelter!<br /><br />While we have been brainwashed about the evils of Fidel Castro's Cuba, the vast majority  of the residents of  present day "Communist" China would be slobbering all over themselves to have  such advanced and universal medical care as Cuba does. For Pete's sake, it took China many years just to get HIV out of their domestic blood supply! But yet, no one in authority, dares demonize "Red" China. Why? Because our two governments are in bed with each other to such a degree neither really cares what the other does to its own people! But Cuba, which is exporting medical breakthroughs, like vaccines, to the entire world, is Public Enemy # 1! Why? Because they won't obey our "American" rules with regards to screwing their own people out of benefits such as Universal Health care!<br /><br />I don't for a second think any country is perfect, whether it be Canada, France, Cuba or any other nation, for that matter. But, when a country that is so incredibly wealthy, powerful and technologically advanced, as the United States, lets numerous people suffer and/or die solely to maximize corporate profits, then it's time for marching in the streets! Maybe we all should be taking lessons from the French! They know how to bring their government to its knees in order to benefit the many over the few!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199204780">Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HYXSDU">Handbook For Nonviolent Action</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520082982">Healing the Masses: Cuban Health Politics at Home and Abroad</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI953A">On revolutionary medicine.(speech by revolutionary Che Guevara to Cuban Militia)(socialized medicine in Cuba)(Speech) : An article from: Monthly Review</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like Wes Craven director Bong Joon-Ho is saying something here.  Also hd/dvd features below"></head><body><p>The host is not original but it is fresh compared to the torture horror of the last few years.  Fans of 50's horror movies, Korean cinema, Jaws, Godzilla, Japanese monster movies, and monster movies in general will enjoy.<br />Because of a superior officer (Scott Wilson) ordering an underling to dump tons of toxic chemicals down a drain which leads to the Han River, years later a creature appears resembling what James Cameron's "Aliens" would look like if they were amphibious.  Like this years Hills Have Eyes 2 this is a monster our government created like the mutants and like our real enemies in Afghanistan and now is our nightmare.<br />This creature appears on the shores and attacks the people capturing a young girl.  Her dysfunctional family ala Little Miss Sunshine set out to get her back while having to break free of soldiers themselves.  The Government claims this creature is "The Host" of an unidentified virus and wants to quarantine everyone, using the fear tactic which has become famous in our society over the years.<br />There are scares in The Host but nothing along the lines of the nasty torture porn there basically innocent in comparison.<br />Two questions come to mind while watching is this ghastly monster scarier then the monsters in the Government in the film, at times the Han River, home to a beast seemed safer.  The other question, and i believe a metaphor, is the U.S. Government's presence helping or more likely hurting the cause?  Sound familiar?<br />The Host is also one of the highest rated movies in 2007 so far on Rottentomatoes receiving a 92% positive out of 128 reviews.<br /><br />THE HD/DVD collectors edition<br /><br />Special Features:<br />-Deleted Scenes<br />-Commentary with Director Bong Joon-Ho<br />-Making of the host with director Bong Joon-Ho<br />-Storyboards<br />-memories of the sewer<br />-Physical special effects<br />-Designing the creature<br />-Bringing the creature to life<br />-Puppet animatronix<br />-Animating the creature<br />-Cast & crew interviews<br />-Actor training<br />-Gag reel<br />-Korean Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />The picture quality as usual with hd dvd was great, was not the best i have seen in comparison with other hd's but was very good.  Image is brighter than a normal dvd, and even stretched to 106" still looked great<br /><br />The sound is also good however on hd dvds i find myself having to turn up my receiver alot louder than normal to hear.</p></body></html>

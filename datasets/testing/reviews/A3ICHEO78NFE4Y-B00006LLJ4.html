I went to see this film knowing of the special effects which i always hate in movies but i did want to see Tom and see how this messures up to some of his other films. To me "Top Gun" is the only good film he ever made. As far as production value this film doesn't go anywhere and nothing ties it together except for Tom smiling, posing, and trying to look good and not get his hair to messed up.I've never been a big fan of Spielberg. He tries to hard all the time to make a good film and in my eyes doesn't have much success. Of course box office will always prove me wrong. But i don't think the american audience demands good acting pictures anymore and they count on special effects to pull them threw a movie which Spielberg is good at.I wasn't impressed but Tom is still good to look at. I wonder if he could make it on Broadway?</p></body></html>

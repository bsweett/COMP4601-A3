<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Artistry in a Ho-Hum Movie"></head><body><p>The story takes place in a world that never was. The time is around the time of the Second World War but that war seems not to have taken place. Dirigibles like the Hindinburg III still ply the airways. People wear trench coats and fedoras. Vehicles are streamlined and there is a Deco feel to everything.<br /><br />There is trouble in the air. Famous scientists are disappearing. One calls ace reporter Polly Perkins to give her a heads up and reveals that all of the missing scientists were part of a secret project in Germany after the first World War. He is the last one.<br /><br />When some huge mechanical monsters show up in New York City, the emergency call goes out to Sky Captain to come and save the day. He flies a modified P 40 Warhawk with neat, albeit 1940ish James Bond style modifications. He also leads a mercenary Sky Legion to protect America. He manages to damage one of the huge mechanical monsters and save the life of his former girlfriend, Polly.<br /><br />It turns out that the mechanical monsters are striking all over the world and stealing the oddest things like power plant generators and zoo animals. Something strange is clearly going on and Sky Captain and the Perky Polly Perkins are going to find out what it is.<br /><br />It is, of course, a mad scientist plot which takes them all over the world before they learn of his Noah's Ark scheme.<br /><br />The story is mediocre. What is engrossing is the stunning array of visual effects. Its as if an old pulp comic book has come to life. Most of this film consists of computer generated effects that are the cutting edge of modernity but the feel is anything but modern. The style, art, lighting and feel of the thing scream of a bygone age. That was wonderful to see. I wish the movie had been as well. The acting and effects are fine. The story was probably not all that good back in the 30s, 40s or 50s.</p></body></html>

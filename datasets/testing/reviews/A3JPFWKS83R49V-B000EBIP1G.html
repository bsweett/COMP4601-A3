<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Family Film"></head><body><p>Based on the classic novel from C.S. Lewis, this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family- type movie that parallels the book very closely as it follows four kids on their journey to the land of Narnia where they find themselves locked in a battle between good and evil.<br /><br />There are many reasons to enjoy this movie but let's start with the film's strongest point of all: Its special effects and make-up. The land of Narnia is populated with many different creatures, some of whom look mostly human; some which look like ordinary animals; and some who resemble a hybrid between an animal and a person. The special effects offered here are excellent, and the team in charge of making this movie deserves extra credit for making these characters seem so life like. Among the characters that are part human and part animal, the ones that stand out are the man/horse creatures. They feature a man's face, arms, and torso attached to the body of a horse and they look very real. With the creatures that are entirely animalistic- like the two beavers- the special effects are still excellent because the appearance is just like the real thing. And the mouth movements are very realistic- so much so that you forget you are viewing something created in a studio.<br /><br />The most impressive of all the characters is that of Aslan, the Lion. This "character" looks just like an actual lion, with a mouth that moves in sync with each word he speaks- exactly like a person who is speaking the same words. Again, the special effects are near- perfect. You cannot tell you are looking at an object created in a Disney studio. It seems very life- like in every way.<br /><br />Besides the excellent special effects, there are many other reasons to enjoy this movie. There is a nice assortment of suspense, humor, fear, and other emotions and many of them come out of nowhere. They keep the film less predictable than it otherwise would be, and that says a lot when you consider that this film is based on a book. I also like the cinematography. The landscape is snowy at first but then switches to a lush, green, mountainous terrain later in the film. This movie was shot in New Zealand (even though it is supposed to take place in England) and the beauty of the New Zealand countryside adds greatly to the film's appeal.<br /><br />Performances in this film are top- notch and I was especially impressed by Georgie Henley, the young actress who plays Lucy. She is the most expressive of the four kid's characters, displaying an array of emotions with conviction, just like a seasoned Hollywood professional. The others are all very good, too, and they all deserve credit for adding so much to this movie.<br /><br />The overall plot of this film is enjoyable and complete- free from any empty holes that leave the viewer puzzled and annoyed. It is also fast- paced, with many scenes depicting fights and open battles as the kids and Aslan take on the evil witch and the various forces of evil.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good motion picture and the type that most people will find entertaining and memorable. It is great for the entire family, and it will likely be one of the top movies this Holiday season.</p></body></html>

I still pop the DVD in the player for a watch from time to time. The FX are dated and cheesy and some of the performances are a little over the top, but the original version had such a charm and quailty that makes it somewhat of a classic for Hollywood's golden age of summer blockbusters.<br /><br />Now for the newest "remake".<br /><br />Well, first off, let's start with the star, Sam Worthington (Terminator:Salvation and Avatar). Sam is a stoic, passionless and expressionless actor. Think William Shatner on downers. His Marine Corps high-and-tight hairdo ruins all credibility and believability of the character of Perseus and his performance is exactly the same as his performances in his previous films. They didn't even TRY to make him look Greek or, at the very least, European.<br /><br />Liam Neeson, usually a fine actor, struts about as the immortal Zues spouting out ham-fisted dialogue and chewing up the scenery. He looks like he is still dressed in his costume from "Excalibur". What a waste of a fine actor.<br /><br />The whole film seems to be focused on action rather than plot or character developement. Some characters simply show up and really have nothing whatsoever to do rather than take up screen time. Also, this version completely ignores the actual mythology that it derives from (so did the original, only not quite as much as the 2010 version).<br /><br />The FX were decent enough, but as it goes all to often in Hollywood lately, they aren't enough to salvage a weak script, bad acting and bad casting. The FX are the only reason that this film rates two stars in my book.<br /><br />My summary opinion, rent (or buy) the original and enjoy a much more satisfying movie-going experience.</p></body></html>

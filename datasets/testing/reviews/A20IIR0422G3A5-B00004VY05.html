My hypothesis is that part of this excellent movie's problem is that it is a cross of at least three genres, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and satire. The best illustrations of the last genre is Mel Brooks' `Young Frankenstein' and that great cult hit `Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Both are so well realized that they almost work as true horror movies, if it weren't for the fact that they were even better spoofs and comedies.<br /><br />`The Fifth Element', on the surface, looks a bit like that great Science Fiction movie, `Blade Runner', especially since it is such a good pairing of hero (Harrison Ford) and heavy (Rutger Hauer), just like our Willis and Oldman duo here. But, `Element' just goes too far over the top in the `what if' department that you simply can't take it seriously. It is almost more like the realization of `The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', except that it never wallows in the absurd the way `Hitchhiker' does. And, it takes its story just serious enough to bring it back into serious Fantasy rather than staying in absurdist humor.<br /><br />Another contrast which comes to mind is the fact that this movie has some strong similarities to that greatest of fantasies, `Lord of the Rings', in that both involve a quest by an unwilling hero against seemingly impossible odds. But then, you come back to the humor, and you loose a lot of the epic aura that made `Lord of the Rings' so great.<br /><br />If there were nothing else good in this movie, the flick would still be worthwhile for the performance of Milla Jovovich as the title character. This seems like a perfect match of role with actor, just as Brad Pitt's performance in another Willis vehicle, `The Twelve Monkeys' was a great match of actor and role, leading to a strongly deserved Oscar nomination. Other performances are also strong. Oldman, as usual, is the epitome of the droll, yet ultimately menacing heavy.  Ian Holm (also in `Lord of the Rings', to make the parallel just a bit more interesting) is a perfect parody of a Gandalf like character, but with little backbone and no magic to speak of. Another interesting piece of casting is Brion James (Rutger Hauer's sidekick in `Blade Runner') as a deadpan general commissioned with the job of getting retired soldier Willis to save the world. And, Chris Tucker is just flat out over the top goofy, fitting his role to a tee, squared.<br /><br />I have never been especially impressed with Bruce Willis' acting in movies past, but he always seems to fit his roles like a glove. In this role, someone like Schwarzenegger could not be cynical enough, Harrison Ford would probably be too serious, Tom Cruise would probably be too earnest, and Clint Eastwood is too old (and making too much money as a director).<br /><br />Except for the fact that the story is far too original, it has all the feel of a graphic novel serialized in `Heavy Metal'. Both the goofy story and the bazaar art direction (check out the police uniforms and compare them to the typical Mobius drawings in `Heavy Metal').<br /><br />One sure sign that the story is being played for melodrama and laughs is the scant 2 seconds by which our heroes save the Earth, by a kiss, of course. This business is straight out of `Goldfinger', another film that plays suspense for its melodrama and humor.<br /><br />Two sure signs that this is a worthwhile movie is that it is fun to rewatch at least once a year and it is fun to write about.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of humor, fantasy, and science fiction, in that order.</p></body></html>

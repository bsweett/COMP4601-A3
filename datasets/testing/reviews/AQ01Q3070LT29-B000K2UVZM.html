She was engaged to Major Matthew Gordon Jr, but he died before he could returned to the United States.  She returned to Southern California in July 1946 to see an old boyfriend she knew in Florida. She lived in at least a dozen homes during those six months. She was last seen on January 9, 1947 and had been missing until they found her body January 15, 1947. Laying in an empty lot at the 3800 block of S. Norton Avenue, Los Angeles, her nude body mutilated, cut in half at the waist separated apart, blood drained and body washed, slashed breasts, cigarette burns, bashed head, mouth cut, deep triangular gouge in her thigh to remove a rose tatto she had. Rope burns on wrists. She was tortured.<br />There were 22 District Attorney suspects investigated. Hundreds of people interviewed. The case is still unsolved.<br />  If the killer or killers are still alive, he or she would be a very old person now.<br />  Brian DePalma (Body Double) along with writer James Ellroy and Universal Pictures offer their version of The Black Dahlia murder mystery.<br />  DVD has option of English, Spanish, French and English, Spanish, French subtitles. 3 featurettes.<br />  In the Kenneth Anger book, "Hollywood Babylon II", are 3 pages of the real, very graphic, close-up photographs of Elizabeth Short's mutilated body at the crime scene.<br />  In the film, all of the murder photographs have been remade fake by the studio, expect for one photograph that Josh Hartnett looks through. One autopsy photograph of the real Elizabeth Short is real.<br />  Today, an apartment building stands on the site.</p></body></html>

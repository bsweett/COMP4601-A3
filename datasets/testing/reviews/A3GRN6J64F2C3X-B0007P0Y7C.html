I'll say one thing, "Elektra" is a busy little movie.  While entertaining you with the immediate (and fast-paced) story at hand, it also finds time to explain and update us on many aspects of Elektra's past, including how she acquired all those amazing fighting skills she displayed in "Daredevil", how she came back from the dead after the end of said film, how and why she eventually had a falling out with her life-saving benefactors and became the assassin for hire she is at the beginning of this film, etc., etc.  So, the movie does all that AND relates her big battle with the evil, mystical group known only as The Hand (the movie's main story), thus paving the road to her redemption.  And it does all this in a shade over 90 minutes.  Whew!<br /><br />A longer, more epic-like movie- with a little more breathing space- might have been better, but who knows for sure?  It's important to remember, after all, that many comics fans weren't all that keen on Elektra's return from the dead in the comics, either (after her memorable death in Daredevil #181), and that some comics readers enjoyed her post-resurrection stories and some didn't.  So it feels kind of appropriate that the movie also generates ambivelent feelings along the lines of "yeah, it's a good enough movie, but did they really need to bring her back from the dead?"<br /><br />The often-talked-about ("it's in the movie... no, wait, they changed their mind and took it out!") cameo appearance by Ben Affleck's Matt Murdock / Daredevil character is finally available for your viewing pleasure in the deleted scenes section, and it's very brief.  Essentially it's Elektra seeing Matt in a dream where he says "Come back to me" and she replies "When I'm ready."  That it's, fifteen seconds tops.  It was so brief that it was silly that they cut it.  It would have provided a nice bit of continuity while also demonstrating that Elektra hadn't completely forgotten or blown off her previous experiences with Matt Murdock.  Oh, well... at least the moment can been seen in some fashion now.<br /><br />The amount of DVD extras are pretty much just right for an entertaining but ultimately- let's be honest- marginal film like this one... you get a few deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes, and a commentary (which I haven't checked out yet).  This may sound like a weird complaint, but I think that too often DVDs give you way too much in the "extras" department, more than most films actually warrant.  To me, that's almost as bad as DVD's that give you little or no extras.  The extras offered here, which are interesting and to the point, feel just right.<br /><br />So, in the end, if you keep your expectations in check, I think you'll generally enjoy watching Jennifer Garner take on a variety of colorful villains for an hour and a half.  So go ahead, give this a whirl.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superman Takes Off On The Big Screen"></head><body><p>Man, time flies........not just Superman.  I say that because I vividly remember when this movie came out in the theater and the excitement it caused. This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects, and I on the big screen, so it was pretty cool, to say the least.  Now,<br /><br />It's still very entertaining, and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain (Gene Hackman as "Lex Luthor") and the lines he delivers. He's a funny guy. Christopher Reeve, meanwhile, was always a popular "Man Of Steel" and the special effects are still fun to watch, from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits. There's a solid soundtrack to this, too.<br /><br />Personally, I never cared for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again, Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying, too. I guess it comes with the territory.  However, being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence it was just too weird watching this movie and  hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were!  (The purity of the  `50s is lone gone!)<br /><br />Whatever, this is still great entertainment. As a superhero, Superman has always been THE MAN. Three sequels followed this film, the second one being the best in my opinion.</p></body></html>

Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent.  It looked like it was recorded digitally, it looked so good, and I'm sure it was.  It appeared to be presented in 2.40:1, so there were black bars at the top and bottom, which is how I prefer movies to be.<br /><br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 was about the best sound I have ever heard.  There was also PCM 5.1, but no DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, or Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack had better surround sound than most DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Blu-Rays.  Lot's of sub-woofer bass also.<br /><br />The movie itself was just okay.  Lot's of action, violence, and blood & guts. I was glad it was only 1 hour and 27 minutes long.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hogwarts: Year Four!!!"></head><body><p>To me, HP4 is the weakest in the series. It's kinda boring and doesn't have too much of a plot. This year, Hogwarts host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates' names are placed. When the three are picked, a fourth name comes out of the goblet; Harry Potter. Each task is very dangerous. After the first task, there is a Yule Ball and shows that Hermione is beginning to fall for Ron. During the last task, Harry will come face-to-face with Voldemort reborn. If you love the series, I'm sure you'll love HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE!!!</p></body></html>

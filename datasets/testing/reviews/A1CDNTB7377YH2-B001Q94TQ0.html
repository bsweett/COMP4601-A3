<meta name="summary" content="Great!"></head><body><p>This is the best foreign film I have seen in years.  Maria, has a fight with her boss and losses her job.  She can't go back and face her family because they need the money and also she is pregnant and doesn't want to live with the father of her child's family.  Maria heads to Bogata, befriending a young man on a motorcycle.  She explains her plight to him and he takes her to someone who can help.  He is a mafia-type working upstairs in a bar.  He will pay her well to be a mulo (mule) which means that she will have to swallow a lot of cocaine packets and carry them to a contact point in New Jersey.<br /><br />Maria, desperate goes along and is joined by a friend.  She soon finds that it is a much harder job than she thought because she can't swallow one of the packets, much less the 50 or so she is expected to swallow.  Then there is the fear of getting caught including several tense moments going through Newark immigration and seeing another woman with her caught.  On top of it is the knowledge that if one packet breaks, she will die.  Such is the fate of one of the ladies travelling on her plane.  When that woman is treated like trash by the contacts in New Jersey, Maria decides to flee.  With no place to go, no knowledge of English, and no right to stay in the US, Maria must find a way to survive.<br /><br />Great cinematography especially in Colombia.  Having been there I felt myself transported back.  Also, the director captures the feel of Jackson Heights, New York, where the later part of the film takes place.<br /><br />Great acting and a very compelling story.  This one should not be missed!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cruise the Terminator"></head><body><p>This is just great movie, maybe best of the year, which is interesting, since the plot, when I heard about it, didn't strike me as particulary original (boy was I wrong).  It's also Mann's best since "Heat," and to some extent even better than that also-great movie. In "Collateral" Mann shrinks the scope considerably, stripping it down to the bare essentials. Oh, there's a wider cast, a plot, and those wonderful camera shots of the city, but what's happening, always, is in the cab, with killer and cabbie. Cruise is a killing machine, but unlike Arnold, he actually acts. The little tics, those eyes, the clipped delivery of lines, Mann burns the reality of the killer right into you. You believe, without doubt, that Cruise -- so often a hero in other flicks -- is a very bad man. Fox is also a good, understated, foil, with his dreams and hopes, colliding with a nightmare (and noirish) journey into the American night. What chance does he have? Watch and see.</p></body></html>

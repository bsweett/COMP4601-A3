<meta name="summary" content="Di Caprio/Spielberg Is Winning Combo"></head><body><p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002), starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a jaunty crowd pleaser.  It's based on the true story of con man Frank Abegnale who, as a teen ager, passed himself off as a lawyer, a doctor, and an airline pilot.  Di Caprio fits the role well, and the setting of the 1960's is wonderfully captured in the film's letter-perfect art direction and period songs on the soundtrack.  Walken was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Frank's father.  And don't miss the terrific opening credit sequence, which will remind you of Saul Bass' memorable title sequences from so many 1950's and 1960's movies.</p></body></html>

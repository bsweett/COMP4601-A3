I just really wish that this film were more interesting.  Instead of giving us anything of substantial depth, director Phyllida Lloyd serves up a series of scenes that serve no purpose other than to prove that Meryl Streep can do anything.  Sadly, her performance is hindered so drastically by the horrific pacing and emotional emptiness that I feel her Oscar win will be largely considered one of the most undeserved in recent years.<br /><br />I'm not going to sit here and bash the film.  It isn't...terrible.  Some critics were relentless and some of my friends said it was the worst film of 2011.  It wasn't.  At least this film isn't insulting.  I would watch this again before watching something like `The Descendants'.  That being said, this film is far from good.  It is actually pretty bad, especially for what it attempts to do.  Lloyd is a very inept director (as was proven by her botched job with `Mamma Mia') and trying to tackle something of considerable depth left her coming up VERY short.  She manages to take a woman who had so many stories to tell and reducing her to a montage a scenes with zero complexity.  The shoddy editing takes us in and out of Thatcher's life, at times in nonsensical order, as a way of weaving her past into her present, but this only serves as a way to take us out of the story and place us elsewhere.  If it weren't for Streep's obvious handle of the material I would have turned the film off a quarter of the way through.  It lags too often, and the unintentional camp that comes in with the constant regurgitation of events (the handling of Thatcher's hallucinations is clich&eacute;d and overused) made my eyes hurt from all the rolling they were doing.<br /><br />It feels weird to say that Lloyd should have called up Ron Howard for tips on how to build a coherent and engaging portrayal of mental illness, but she should have.<br /><br />The lack of emotional connect makes this a really shallow portrait of an important woman.  By film's end, we really don't learn anything about her.  Lloyd is so bent on portraying Thatcher's inability to let go of her late husband that she fails to build anything else, and she forgets to really color in WHY Thatcher can't let go.  The scenes with Streep and Broadbent don't paint Denis Thatcher as anything special or really allow them to build a relationship.  In fact, Thatcher is basically painted as a solitary entity the entire length of the film with no real emotional ties to anyone.  Her ambition drives her, but that is never truly explored, and I wouldn't have even took to that concept had Broadbent not shouted it at the camera in one particular scene.  Lloyd doesn't layer anything here.  She tries to pass off segues as complete thoughts (let's zoom in on a photograph and then show scene that has no tie to the last and then zoom out at an old woman staring blankly at a wall and call that depth) and it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Streep is a wonderful actress.  She can really do no wrong.  Her talent is non-negotiable and yet even she falls victim to Lloyd's horrendous grasp of the material.  By splicing the film in such a nonsensical manner, Lloyd has stripped Streep's performance of depth and meaning and merely presented us with a really good mimicry act, but nothing more.  Streep embodies Thatcher, but she doesn't tell us anything about her.<br /><br />Poor Viola Davis.</p></body></html>

I'm not sure if you would call it's ending a "twist," but it made me gasp when it suddenly brought a whole landscape of emotion into focus with an amazing depth of field.<br /><br />Furthermore, this movie has one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen on screen. Samuel L. Jackson plays a precise and learned art dealer with a special affinity for original classic comic book drawings. His genetic affliction limits the physical activity he can engage in, but his imagination has always been free to entertain strange possibilities. This truly is an original portrayal that could never typecast Jackson. His role is not as romantic lead, not as supporting character actor, not as doctor, lawyer, merchant... It's what he is that in the end creates the shock of brilliant resolution.<br /><br />This is a movie whose intricacies will haunt you long after the fact. And even if you never had any interest in comic books, you will probably walk away from `Unbreakable" with a new respect for what Joseph Campbell might call their "power of myth."<br /><br />One word about the availability of this film - I see a lot of the single-disc versions of it are available only in "Region 2" DVD format. You would need a "Multi-Region" or "Universal" DVD player to play these versions. As I understand it, all DVD players are manufactured with the capability of playing all DVDs. However, the players are then set by distributors to play in only one region, most often the US/Canada Region 1 - in order to block overseas bootlegging versions and other illicit overseas offerings.<br /><br />There are on-line sites presumably listing decoding sequences that will allow you to "unlock" your specific DVD player so it will play all regions. However most people I've talked with have found these decoding sequences don't work. This can be frustrating because it seems an increasing number of English or foreign movies and comedy series are being offered only in non-Region 1 formats lately.<br /><br />So if you want to buy one of the single-disc Region 2 versions of "Unbreakable" listed on this website, you might need to consider buying a "Multi-Region" DVD player on-line, or else you might want to go to an ethnic neighborhood (such as an East Indian community) in a large city to find a Multi-Region player.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood Has Long Been Out of Ideas"></head><body><p>Let me see if I get this striaght:  We're supposed to pretend that George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle (who?) are Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr.  Give me a break!  I could barely sit through this self-serving slice of backhanded hommage.  What a slick and disingenuous waste of time and money.  But, this is to be expected from a Hollywood totally bereft of any new ideas.  That Steven Soderburgh is being touted as some kind of &quot;auteur&quot; is an even sicker joke.  Andy Garcia and Carl Reiner, what were you thinking?<p>This film is my nominee for a moritorium on remakes.</p></body></html>

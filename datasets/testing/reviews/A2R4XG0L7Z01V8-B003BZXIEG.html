Or giving in to your star so she gets a bigger role, and still gives an uninspired performance? Rumour has it, Halle Berry was refusing to come back and play Storm, because she didn't have a lot of screen time in the first two movies. So we get more of her, and a lot less of Mystique, who could have had a big storyline, but that was dropped.<br /><br />Also Cyclops (James Marsden) made the mistake of signing on to be in Superman Returns as well, and his role is greatly reduced, to a couple of scenes, and a gravestone. He gets killed by the love of his life (boy, that must have sucked), and guess what? His death happens off screen.<br /><br />And what was the sense in bringing back Famke Jansen? She doesn't do much apart from stand around and look menacing, but I suppose being brought back from the dead will do that to anyone. How exactly did she manage to come back? The character is really underdeveloped. She stands around in the background for most of the movie, until she decides to "annihilate" something or someone, just for the special effect.<br /><br />The special effects were alright, trying to make up for what was a serious lack of plot. The special effects used in the beginning of the film, where we see what happens 20 years earlier (which bore no relation to the rest of the film at all), was wasted. They attempted to make Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen 20 years younger. They amazingly failed on Patrick - he looked no different whatsoever. And Ian was given brown hair. And their faces were obviously edited and smoothed out compared to the other actors in the scene. How much money is thrown at these kinda ageing things per second?<br /><br />Then there was the obvious referencing other movies. (Or stealing scenes if you prefer.) When the film properly starts, it's nearly a direct steal from the Terminator films. The scene between IceMan and FireGuy towards the end? Did anyone else notice it was the same as the two wands clashing between Harry & Voldemort? Then at the end, it looked very similar to the final scene in Carrie, with Famke as Carrie. The bullet stopping scenes is referencing Matrix Reloaded? Or one of those films.<br /><br />And the point in Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut is? The guy cannot act. When will people start realising this! The 'fat' suit he was wearing was meant to make him look like a big muscle man, but he ended up looking like a sumo wrestler gone wrong.<br /><br />Anna Paquin's role as Rogue is greatly reduced, to practically being non-existent. Wasn't she the main part of the first film? Was it worth her time turning up for filming? Did she use her mutant powers once during the film? No.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in this film, and had to keep pausing it as I couldn't remember what happened in the first two movies. But I remember really liking the first one. But this seemed like CGI/action scene one after the other. And Xavier is killed. I kept expecting him to make another appearance, to come back. Well, if they brought back Famke Jansen ...!!!<br /><br />Hopefully, this is the last, disappointing finale to the X-Men trilogy. Although, judging by the ending, they're hoping for another. Zzz. Lets hope not! If you're going to name the movie "The Last Stand" don't imply that something else is going to happen at the end!<br /><br />This film should never have been made. If it wasn't for Wolverine, I probably would have given this film less stars. If Mystique had stayed and been given a bigger role, the film would have got more stars. I understand this review had been one big rant. But watch the movie and you'll understand why it should have never been made.<br /><br />Actually don't watch the movie. Read the one/two star reviews for it. Surely that should be enough to convince you.</p></body></html>

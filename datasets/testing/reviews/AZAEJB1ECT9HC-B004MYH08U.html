When I heard that Seth Rogen would be playing the Hornet in the movie version, I expected the worst. (Sort of like Will Smith in "The Wild Wild West," a horrendous fiasco that should have never been made.)  I went to see this film in the movies and was pleasantly surprised: despite being silly at times, it turned out to be an entertaining film.<br />First of all, a little of Seth Rogen goes a long way and he can be quite annoying at times. (Hes much more down-to-earth in the special features.)  Jay Choi is good as Kato, the man who seemingly can do everything, Christolph Waltz is a riot as the villain of the piece and Cameron Diaz contributes nothing but having Rogen and Choi fight over her.  (Theres along and ridiculous fight scene between the Reid and Kato over Diaz that should have wound up on the cutting room floor.)<br />Whats great about this film are the action scenes and stunts which are terrific.  Theres an incredibly long chase and action scene between the Hornet's car, the "Black Beauty," and many heavily armed vehicles of the bad guys that goes on forever.  (This scene is even longer in the deleted scene segment of the special features.)  The car scene ends and another explosive fight scene continues in the offices of the Daily Sentinel, the newspaper owned by Brit Reid, the secret identity of The Green Hornet.  The stunts and action scenes were performed by legendary stuntman, Vic Armstrong and many members of his family.<br />Look, as stated, this film can be very silly at times and Rogen can be hard to take, but, for the most part, this is an exciting and enjoyable film.  The special features on the blu-ray are very good: deleted scenes, gagreel, features on the writing of the film, the creation of the "Black Beauty," the stunts, the special effect, etc. etc.  The picture and sound quality are terrific.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than I anticipated"></head><body><p>I've put off watching this movie because I had caught snippets of the '88 version years ago was never impressed enough to watch the whole thing.  I might do so now to compare.  I found this version fresh and fun and even a little inspiring.  And even though I can respect John Travolta for being a actor's actor-a man who even over 30 years in the biz willing to take some serious risk, I pray that he will now please step away from dresses and high heels.  I easily found him to be the weakest singer of the lot and his makeup more disturbing than anything else.  That was my only gripe.  I love the music and the message.  I also think Michelle Pfeiffer is just stunning and Christopher Walken as funny as always.</p></body></html>

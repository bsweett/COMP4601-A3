Emile Hirsch did a fantastic job as the real life character, "Alexander Supertramp". He embodied the character and carried the movie.  I think he reason why I loved the movie so much is because I identify with Alexander Supertramp's belief system, except not to the extreme. I go through stages of wanting to give up on people and "soceity", but I'm not willing to isolate and rebel against something that is stronger than the powers that be.  Point in case, he died for his beiefs and it seemed he regreted some of the core of what he was trying to prove to himself with the scribble of a quote he enscribed in one of his novels "happiness only real when shared".  I think he realized when he was near death that isolation is not the answer.  But his journey was a self chosen path that I'm sure was his destiny, and in fact inspired many people he came in contact with.  In hindsight, I believe that in his mind and soul, his beilief was worth dying for.  It's rare to find that quality in human beings, so I commend him for that, but I disagree with some of his bizarre actions that led to his death.  There were also some contridictions to his core belief system in regards to "money".  The practical side of me asked questions like "if you are so against the money system, why did you rely on other people's money that you came into contact with, which is borderline "using people" in my mind.  You can't escape the fact we all need money to survive in the end.  Aside from all the philosophical aspects of the film, I thought Sean Penn did a fantastic job directing. I also loved the music by Eddie Veder. On the weird front, there were some bizarre moments like the "apple scene" and the danish couple encounter and the MC Hammer song?  I was like "whoa, ok....".  Overall I felt like I was on the journey with him, it was an incredible but tedious ride.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrible"></head><body><p>This is the worst picture I have seen all year.  I didn't have high hopes for this one after hearing some reviews, but even then this falls so far below bad.  Keanu I guess has an ideal role.  He plays an alien without emotions.  That is tailor made for Reeves who seems to have the same facial expression for glad, mad, sad in every wooden performance.  Jennifer is completely wasted in her role.  Jaden Smith is so annoying, I was hoping for the end of the world just to shut him up.  The original is a classic and really didn't need a remaking, especially a politically correct version that incorporates the be kind to the environment or else thought process.  Okay special effects, but the film is just boring.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is "THE" Christmas Classic Movie In Our House!"></head><body><p>"A Christmas Story" is by far my family's favorite holiday movie! Our VHS tape wore out and we had to replace it with this DVD. We watch it at least twice during the Christmas season and once or twice in the summer. We also find ourselves quoting some of the classic lines all year round!<br /><br />Based on great book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385021747">In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash</a>, this movie captures the mania that built up around Christmas in almost every child in a more innocent age. The sub plots are well conceived and wonderfully woven into the story.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!</p></body></html>

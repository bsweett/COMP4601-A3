<meta name="summary" content="Stellar Cast, Great Production...but we've seen this movie"></head><body><p>Loved SILENCE OF THE LAMB and was disappointed with HANNIBAL.  And I remember and enjoyed MANHUNTER back in the 80's.<p>So I wasn't in a big hurry to see RED DRAGON, despite having such a stellar cast.  Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel AND Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector?  Now that's a cast.  I watched it and enjoyed it, especially the departures it made from the novel and the original movie.<br />If this film came out in the mid-1980's (before MANHUNTER), would be one of the greatest thrillers of all time.  Everyone's great in it.<p>But, despite hitting on every piston in everything else, my enthusiasm for the movie was lost because...I already knew this story.<br />(I think this is a huge problem in Hollywood: the acting, the technology, everything has exceeded the writing.  The stories, for whatever reason, have been up there with everything else.  Lack of development, rushed deals, whatever.  In this particular example, the story was exhausted.)</p></body></html>

This is exactly the case with Paul Giamatti playing Miles in this film. After seeing American Splendor, I could not fathom how the same man could so convincingly depict a Californian metrosexual, wine snob who is far more sensitive than the women he meets. Giamatti's is a heckuva talent because, on top of everything else, he takes the thoroughly beaten clich&eacute; of unpublished layabout writer and morphs it into a believable role, or as his friend says, which so aptly describes his life: "They think you're a writer." If I would have read the description of his character on paper, there would be no way that I'd even be slightly interested in him, but in this movie you cannot help but care throughout.<br /><br />The film definitely has an avant-guard feel with its early double, triple, and quadruple feature frames and camera angles. The landscape of the wine country is marvelous so the physical setting could not be improved upon. Authenticity is the most accurate word for the film making. The actors look like real people and so does everybody else. When Miles calls his ex-wife via a payphone, her voice legitimately sounds as if we're listening to it through an obsolete receiver.<br /><br />The only real quandary I had when watching Sideways is just how Thomas Haden Church, who plays Jack, ever became best friends with Miles in the first place even if they were college roommates. Church is a wooden, shallow Ken doll who just wants to have a good time and forget that he's getting married; whereas, Miles wishes he were still married. The one is a connoisseur of outstanding wine while the other just wants to know what the alcohol content is.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen is the sister of Michael Madson and she looks far younger than her real age. Speaking of which, it was a fine idea to use older, mature looking actors in this film because there are few wine enthusiasts in their early twenties. A particularly well-done, and uncommon, scene occurs when Miles projects his own personality onto the Pino grape. He seems to have no idea that he is doing it but, in Madsen's eyes, we can see that she comprehends.<br /><br />I'd have to say that Sideways is a highly refreshing film as it is subtle, sensitive, and redeeming.</p></body></html>

He's stuffed in all the book's action, such as it is, but it feels very much like a checklist:<br /><br />Dementors in Little Whinging (check)<br />The Order of the Phoenix in London (check)<br />Dolores Umbridge in pink (check)<br />Dumbledore's Army (check)<br />The battle at the Ministry (check)<br /><br />Yes, it's all there, but done without the slightest bit of emotion, suspense, or magic.  Handsome Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) gets no chance to play the matinee idol; he's reduced to rushing breathlessly from scene to scene looking surprised and saying little.  Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) have so little to do and say that they're virtually lost in the shuffle.  Ralph Finnes (Voldemort) is more annoying than scary, and Helena Bodham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) utters just two lines.  Even the long-awaited Kiss with Harry and Cho is totally lacking in feeling - just do it and move on. (check)<br /><br />The cast and crew aren't to blame for this tepid, choppy, confusing mess; the interminable book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/043935806X">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)</a> had about 800 pages of filler.  It bothered me that we don't really learn anything about the titular "Order" in either book or movie.  The mysterious (ooooh!) "prophesy" deserved a single paragraph in the book and a short scene in the movie, yet it's the centerpiece of both(?).  Yates did the best he could with this tedious story, but it's the first Harry Potter film that didn't leave me dreaming wistfully of the wizarding world.</p></body></html>

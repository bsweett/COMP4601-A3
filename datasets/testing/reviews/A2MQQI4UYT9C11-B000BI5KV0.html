<meta name="summary" content="Brrrr!"></head><body><p>This movie features two amazing stories--the lifestyle of the Emperor Penguin, which I was somewhat familiar with from children's books, and the untold story of "how in the world did they make this movie", which features footage from the coldest, windiest, most storm-ravaged place on the planet, Antartica.  At least the filmmakers got to leave at some point. By the will of God or evolution, penguins continue to struggle to maintain the species in the face of the harshest of elements.</p></body></html>

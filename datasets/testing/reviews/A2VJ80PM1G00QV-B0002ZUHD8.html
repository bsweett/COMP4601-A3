<meta name="summary" content="Cowboys and Indians Arthurian Style"></head><body><p>Now that Cowboys and Injuns is (appropriately) no longer the genre which allows pre-modern warfare in all its hand-to-hand Gore, Film Studios are hard put to find a substitute. What better than a Popular Legend, King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable,along with a bit of Feminism, Amazons who can wield a bow and arrow with the best of them and sufficiently agile to avoid spears, knives, axes, in  hand to combat without any need for the armor that the men wore. I couldn't quite make out the various ways in which the Chief Female made her kills, but did see her straddling one guy from the rear with wide-open mouth; I believe a sword also played a role in her repertoire of weaponry, I did expect Errol Flynn, either as Custer or Robin Hood, to rise to the occasion, but was disappointed on that score. There was talk of Rome, Christianity, Freedom, and Saxons, but somehow the native Celts, upon whom the others were feeding in that era, did not get a play. Of course, after the Celts, Saxons, Danes and Vikings had a shot at control of the area we would call England, the Normans ultimately successfully invaded and took permanent control.<br />Without much need to fall back on reality, which is nearly absent from our common knowledge of this period in " England"", the film-makers had pretty much a free hand to invent what they wanted to...and they did.<br />Over-all, it is not a bad picture if you only allow your mind to dwell on the fighting and not to the politics or cultural attributes which were at the heart of the struggle.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Many fine moments, but really not a comedy..."></head><body><p>This is definitely worth seeing once, due to some excellent casting, sharp writing, and a few surprises. However, I never considered it a comedy. It is an exaggerated slice of life depiction of a dysfunctional family's long weekend road trip from New Mexico to Southern California for a child "beauty pageant." Grandpa shoots up heroin, big brother does not speak at all, by choice, Mom's brother is a gay suicide survivor, Mom is disappointed in her husband's dreams of being the next self-help guru. Abby Breslin as the pageant contestant is superb, but there are several moments of tension or sadness in here which, while well-done, do outrank the laughs.</p></body></html>

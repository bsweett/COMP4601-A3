<meta name="summary" content="Life and Times of George Bailey - Magical Capra Film!"></head><body><p>This weekend is the 64th anniversary of that great old film, It's a Wonderful Life.  I found that this weekend is also the It's a Wonderful Life festival at Seneca Falls, NY, which claims it was the inspiration for Bedford Falls (see their site here: [...], which also includes an appearance by Karolyn Grimes, who was the character Zuzu and her pedals).<br /><br />But what a story!  I'm sure most readers know this story and the DVD I picked up had a lot of interesting extras and "making of" that was fascinating.<br /><br />The film is a slice of Americana, taking us from the Roaring 20s to the post-war era of the mid 1940s.  Featured is George  Bailey, the son of a small town building and loan president, whose kind heart and common sense had kept the town running for years.<br /><br />On the other side of the spectrum is old Potter, a miserly miser that makes Scrooge look generous by comparison.<br /><br />The story's general plot goes through George's life through the eyes of an angel, a little guy who wants to earn his wings.  He watched with the viewer as George grows up:  George prevents several deaths, gets the town through a run on the bank during the '29 Depression and gets through the war.  He has kids and runs a successful business that is booming.<br /><br />Despite these successes, his uncle loses money that was accidentally given to the Potter miser.  Potter looks at this as an opportunity to finally beat George.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart's acting ability was amazing in this film.  His range from pure happiness to deep despair was palpable.  Despite his personal sacrifices to give up his dreams for the benefit of others, George Bailey was finally at the end of his rope.  Stewart's performance as a broken man on that bridge was just an amazing piece of cinema.<br /><br />No Man Is a Failure Who Has Friends:<br /><br />Many themes in this film too many to mention, really.  There is a reason why this film has endured as a Christmas treat.  It is deep and philosophical without being preachy.  It has a dark side that cuts across the aisle of greed and despair, of heartache, and of suicidal tendencies.  The film raises you up and makes you think.<br /><br />What if you had never been born?  What hole would be hard to fill without your contribution to people around you and to Man as a species?  Would lives have been better off if you had never existed?<br /><br />DVD Specials:<br /><br />I enjoyed the bits with Frank Capra's son as he went over his father's inspiration for the film.  They showed a clip from an interview with Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra himself.  It's Capra's favorite film.<br /><br />The DVD also has a brief spot with Tom Bosley who again goes over similar ground to the bit on the "making of" segment, but adds some film history.  It's a Wonderful Life was not a hit at the box office at its release.  In fact, viewers thought it too depressing for the holiday season (which I find simply unbelievable).<br /><br />When the film fell into the public domain, it was shown on TV in the 70s and there was a revival for it.  Now we have Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) touring the country pushing the film.  Karolyn has an endearing and powerful personal story herself, which I wish was part of the DVD set.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  An enduring, heartwrenching film (for me, anyway) that nearly always makes me cry as well as makes me look at my life.  Would it had been better I'd never been born?  For George Bailey the answer is a resounding no!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark, violent & puzzling"></head><body><p>Daredevil, the Man Without Fear, should probably be described as one of Marvel's lesser superheroes; at least, nobody has yet penned a Complete Guide to him, as they have to Spiderman, X-Men, and the Fantastic Four, who have also been given filmic incarnations.  And on the whole, so far, I think their versions are better than his.  DD, like Spiderman, calls New York his hunting ground, and like Spidey he is perceived as a vigilante.  But when DD is "at work," he's all business--there's no humor or lightness to what he does at all, and unlike Spidey, he often sets out specifically to kill those he sees as transgressors against justice.  His motivations are to some extent understandable--his alter ego, Matt Murdock, is an attorney whose father, a boxer trying for a comeback, was murdered on the night of his great triumph, and Matt himself, as a boy, was often a target for bullies--and even laudable to anyone who has grumbled about people "getting off on technicalities" or "beating the system."  And, as is shown in an early courtroom system, Matt's superpowers, which include greatly enhanced hearing, serve him as a kind of biological lie detector: when an accused rapist claims on the stand that his victim "enjoyed it," Matt knows by the rate of his heartbeat that he's lying.  Still, this is a very dark, violent film, and not one that I could really enjoy.  To be sure it has its moments: the early flashback to Matt's boyhood, showing his strong bond with his father, how he got his powers, and how he began to train them; the beautifully choreographed "fight" between Matt and the love of his life, Electra Nathios, on the day they meet; Daredevil's heart-stopping leaps from New York's towering buildings.  And villain Bullseye is a very creepy psycho--just the kind of person you don't want to meet in a dark alley.  At the end, though, I found myself wondering about questions that weren't addressed.  How did an orphaned kid from a poor neighborhood find the money to go to college and law school?  Why and when did Matt/Daredevil confide in his local priest regarding his secret identity?  How does an attorney whose partner gripes (good-humoredly) about their heavy load of pro bono cases afford Matt's sleek, high-tech, almost Fortress-of-Solitude-ish apartment?  Why, when he wants to go to sleep (as opposed to sleeping *with* somebody), does he submerge himself in what appears to be a coffin filled with water?  How did Matt explain the wound drilled through his shoulder by Electra's sai?  Any of these questions could have been answered very simply with a line or two of dialogue.  It's the business of a movie to make its "world" real to its viewers, to be plausible within the parameters of the universe it's set in; if it's fantasy, that's one thing, but the Marvel movies are supposed to take place in a reality only a step or two sideways from our own.  When the filmmakers don't seem to care enough about their reality to "make it real," they spoil the movie for me.  So this is a DVD I *won't* be buying, and not one that I can recommend.</p></body></html>

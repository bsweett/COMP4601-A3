<meta name="summary" content="Good Photography But Takes Too much Pain to Tell Details"></head><body><p>For all its superb production design (by Martin Childs, Oscar-winner for "Shakespeare in Love"), and stunning and authentic visuals depicting late-Victorian England, "From Hell" remains unsatisfactory because, instead of creating a mystery, thrill, or horror, the film tries to "explain" murky events surrounding Jack the Ripper. <p>No one will question the value of cinematography in "From Hell," but the tedious development of story damages the film very much as the Hughes Brothers throw too many things into the film.  If you don't know anything about Jack the Ripper, you might be puzzled before the Masonic conspiracy, a kidney sent to the police, a message on the wall, and alleged involvement of the royal family.  All these factors are certainly based on truth, as 'Ripperians' or people who study this serial murder case (including Allan Moore, who wrote the original graphic novel) know, but they are all crammed into such a disjointed way that during the two hour of the film's running time, we start to lose interests.  To make matters worse, the filmmakers tries to send a social comment about the cold-hearted nature of upper-class society of Victorians through the characters of Ian Holm and Ian Richardson.  England may be a class-society, but those caricatures (with their histrionic performance) only perplexed me, making the entire film a very unstable stance whether I should be angry with them, or chilled with the Ripper.  I get the point, but they should have been restricted the film's subject within the murders, without extending it to its social cause.  <p>About other aspects, I have little to say.  The casting of Heather Graham could have been justified if she looked a little more like a prostitute, or the film did not take itself so seriously.  As the basic story is sentimental and melodramatic, they could have made it more outrageous and suspeseful, and in that case, Ms. Graham might have got away with her uneven  accent.  Of course, then, the Hughes Brothers must take much more liberty with the original book, and its meticulous details would be gone.  In the end, as the result shows, they took a fairly serious approach, and I respect that decision.  However, I confess, as I went through the two hours in theater, I thought I might as well be reading the original book.<p>"From Hell" is a stylish film, but as a thriller it falls short of good pace and enough chill, and as a film noir, its subject is too intriguing and thrilling with detailed information to be made into a flat melodrama.  Using the same subject, Alfred Hitchcock once directed a silent film "The Lodger (1926)."  It remains stylish even today, but he completely changed the related facts to draw audience into his world.  My vote goes to him, but of course, only as a cinema, not as a study of the Ripper.</p></body></html>

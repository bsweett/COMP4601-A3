If not, don't.  That's about it, but I'll go on some more anyway.<br /><br />Major release horror movies are always bound to be a mixed bag, particularly because this kind of film leans towards theoretically fun horror movie rather than the, well, horrifying sort.  And this is definitely true of the 'Final Destination' films; it's hard to imagine anyone being terrified or disturbed by them provided they aren't a small child or a complete pansy.  I prefer serious horror films, generally, but this sorta thing can work too, and FD films are some of the best horror movies of this kind to come out in recent memory.  FD3 is certainly nothing more than reiteration, but the original ideas are amusing enough for another go round, and this one proves to probably be the best of the series.  (It's a tough call, though.  They're all in about the same range, quality-wise.)<br /><br />The premise is exactly the same as the previous two films:  A high schooler, Wendy, has a premonition of death just prior to riding on a roller coaster and flips out, causing herself and about half a dozen others to get off the ride.  The premonition, of course, comes true, and they're all spared.  But apparently Death isn't so pleased with this and proceeds to off them one by one in the order that they would've died during the accident all via bizarre, impossible coincidences and accidents, and  if you escape the trap Death passes you by and heads to the next person.  Wendy, as did the other FD protagonists, has premonitions of sorts regarding the impending deaths and, adding a new wrinkle to the plot, they also discover that the numerous pictures that they took prior to the roller coaster ride contain clues as to their future demises.  Thus, after the opening, the film is just a series of set pieces where they're killed via elaborate contraptions interspersed with scenes of them standing around and talking about how they're gonna die, and how that sucks and all.<br /><br />The film gets off to a somewhat slow start.  They probably spend too much time at the spooky carnival and the roller coaster crash itself proves to be fairly unimpressive.  A roller coaster disaster sounds good in theory, but I dunno how you're gonna actually shoot this effectively, and apparently Wong doesn't either.  It's okay as it is, but the disasters in the previous films were better, particularly the spectacularly over the top crash from FD2.<br /><br />Once it gets going it's better than ever before, however.  Wendy is probably the most likable protagonist in the series, though that's not much of a prize, and the most annoying characters are generally killed first.  Furthermore, they just generally spend less time standin' around and talking and more time gettin' killed.  The set pieces are the most consistently amusing and perhaps most elaborate ones yet in the series, though I won't discuss them too specifically as that would kinda ruin it.  (There's nothing quite as ridiculously amusing as the teacher death from 1 nor as great as the squishing from 2, but it's got wonderful consistency.)  The film is about as gory as mainstream horror gets, definitely on the level of FD2 if not higher and far surpassing the original. (Which sadly, had little gore to speak of.)  It's also got a few relatively original deaths, though I emphasize relatively, as there just isn't a whole lot more you can do to the human body that hasn't been done yet.  On top of the high gore quotient its also got probably the most painful, vicious deaths in the series, giving it a bit more visceral punch, though it's still a fairly light hearted affair, as far as horror films go. (Spoiler Alert: Particularly note the roasting via tanning beds and the chick receiving about half a dozen nails thru the back of the head from a disturbingly high powered nail gun. Ouch)<br /><br />Wong and Morgan wrote the film again, and it's got some of the old humorous touches from the original that didn't make it into the sequel, or weren't as affective and noticeable, anyway.  Overall, it's just a bit smarter and better written than 2, though that ain't exactly what you're looking for when you go to this sorta film.<br /><br />Sadly, Tony Todd (the Candyman) isn't back as the creepy mortician.  Sure, I thought his appearance in 2 was kinda silly and unnecessary, but once the pattern is established I figured they'd continue with it.  Too bad.  He is back, however, in a sufficiently appropriate role, I suppose.<br /><br />On a final, insignificant note, there's a scene where they look at a photo of the WTC supposedly just before 9/11 where there is a phantom shadow of an airplane on it.  (This is supposed to connect in with the idea that the photos can show how the deaths will occur.)  This is very amusing, as it will certainly offend plenty of whiny babies and it's surprising that they'd dare do this.  (I haven't the faintest idea why this would offend people, but I'm absolutely sure it will. If I really understood why something was offensive I'd be offended too.)  Anyway, good for them.  It's rare to see the film business not be cowardly, particularly for no good reason.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

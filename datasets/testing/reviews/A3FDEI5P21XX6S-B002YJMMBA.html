<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Blu product filled with hours of reading"></head><body><p>I actually liked how this package ended up taking more time to read than watch (and I did watch both versions). Regardless of your take on the book to film translation or beliefs, the film came across on Blu wonderfully.<br /><br />The Blu clarity is finite throughout with the only shortcomings being the CGI and green screen lines. The DTS was superb, though the score drowns out some material a few times, but certain sequences were reference (the interior water sounds at unrated 48:10 and several dialogue echoes in chambers throughout). The case is a much stronger hinge than the other Blus I have rated this quarter (wish they were all made this way) and I actually had to work at breaking it.<br /><br />BD DISC 1: (Films only)<br />Both versions of the film are playable with CineChat or MovieIQ. There was no one online yet for Cinechat so I was pretty lonely on that one. MovieIQ only takes a minute to load up on my PS3 and provides the usual plethora of IMDBish material and trivia regarding plot, actors, score, etc. The unrated plays eight minutes longer and the edits are scattered equally (1.5 minutes  added in by the 24-minute mark, 5 minutes by the burning scene). The main rating change would have been in the burning sequence as they edited out all of the kills in the rated (the gore is graphic so would have garnered an R here).<br /><br />BD DISC 2: (Supplements only)<br /><br />Rome Not built in a Day: 17:30 minute making of. Shows the amount of CGI involved and the usual logistical stuff and interviews.<br />Writing: 10:09 minute Ron Howard interview narration on the script and such.<br />Characters: 17:10 minutes of interviews and the actors giving their takes on what they were trying to do here.<br />CERN: 14:50 minute documentary about the science center shown in the film. I liked this the most but I am a dork that way, will probably be the dryest supplement for most people.<br />Props: 11:35 minute take on the obvious need to make the stuff look good.<br />Full Story: 9:46 minute further making of with Ron Howard. Covers some wardrobe stuff and could have been included with the first one.<br />Ambigram: 4:46 minute history of the word history by John Langdon. Interesting little tidbits here adn there - especially the part (they show from the film) where his book is next to the one Hanks picks off a shelf.<br /><br />Path of Illumination.<br />Five sections of learning material divided into two parts each, one part has Ron Howard describing the section (Plaza, Pantheon, etc.) and the other part has tons of textual info regarding the location selected. If you read everything offered it can eat up an hour or so. I think the experience is worthwhile and it contained some solid material.<br /><br />DISC 3: Digital Copy and Zimmer Music software.<br /><br />* The Music part (copy/pasted from text info):<br />" This trial version provides the full functionality of the Sequel 2 retail version. While it contains only a selection of the retail version's content, three Hans Zimmer projects with audio material from the movie Angels & Demons have been added. Feel free to modify the projects with the sounds and tools Sequel 2 Trial Angels & Demons Edition has to offer. Pictures taken from the movie have been added to the list of track icons, which are used to label individual tracks."<br /><br />The installation process takes a bit as it puts in several programs - but I must not be musically inclined because the program looks overwhelming. LOTS to go through with music creation, recording, and so on - wow.<br /><br />* There are weblinks and Sony website sign-up info for getting Sony stuff.<br /><br />Overall, a large volume of material added to another history/drama/Hanks/Howard production that entertains the masses. Enjoy.<br /><br />EDIT: A good point was brought up after I posted this review about the artwork pictured here - this set is the 3 disc BD set described (but the artwork is the same as you would get on the 2 disc DVD set).</p></body></html>

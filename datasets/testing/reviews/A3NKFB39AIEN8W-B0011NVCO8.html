But, first let me digress a moment to applaud Mr. Scott for yet another great film. There are directors who I look upon as the infrastructure--the superhighways--on today's movie landscape. Spielberg, Cameron, Scorsese, Scott (Tony), Lynne, Tarantino, Greengrass, Nolan, Greenaway, Tykwer, Verhoeven, Noe, Amoldavar, Jackson, Inarritu, Anno, Lee--when I see these names attached to any movie, I automatically know that the movie's going to at least be decent, if not, damn good. If Hollywood had a Mount Rushmore, Ridley Scott's image--and those of his contemporaries--should be deeply etched one stratum below the immortal images of Hitcock, Fellini, Bergman, Lang, Coppola, Powell, Kubrick, Kurosawa, etc. From BladeRunner, to Alien, to Gladiator, and now American Gangster, Ridley Scott's canon of films are among the best films ever.<br /><br />Now, to my two exceptions: First, Denzel Washington. The man ages like wine. Like DeNiro or Clint Eastwood, Washington is a ticket pull all by himself. His presence and machismo overpowers the screen. He makes a bad movie watchable. In fact, I can't recall the last bad movie he starred in, which speaks a lot of his intelligence in selecting quality scripts.<br /><br />Secondly, there's Russell Crowe. Like Denzel, Russell Crowe is a man's man in every role he plays, whether he's playing good-guy or bad-guy it doesn't matter. He proves that the leading man doesn't have to be Brad-Pitt-pretty-boy to be a Hollywood leading man. Russell's got the kind of durable rugged looks and powerful rottweiler build you're likely to see on some guy in the middle of the road driving a jackhammer through the pavement. Or the kind of guy you'd envision out on probation--the kind of guy you wouldn't want to see at night in a dark alley. Like Denzel, Russell can carry a movie on his back, and also like Denzel, Russell knows how to select quality scripts.<br /><br />American Gangster is the story of Frank Lucas and his rise to the pinnacle of Harlem's organized crime world. Under the tutelage of his ailing mentor, Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson, Frank Lucas foresees the end of the old model of organized crime based on middlemen, exaggerated profits, and diluted product. Young Lucas is Johnson's personal driver and sole prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Following Johnson's death, Harlem's drug scene washes into a violent free-for-all with up and comers battling to succeed Bumpy as Harlem's kingpin. Meanwhile, Frank Lucas is aloof. Even before Bumpy's death, Frank had been quietly formulating his own schemes for life and crime AFTER ol' Bump, who'd constantly lament about the good old days of customer service, middlemen, and respect among thieves. Bumpy's death frees Frank to do business a different way.<br /><br />He disrupts the monopoly of the New York Italian Mafia. Frank personally flies to Asia and establishes a direct link to smuggle heroin into the U.S.  He enlists a distant cousin, U.S. Army sergeant Leslie "Ike" Atkinson, to transport his dope into the U.S. inside the coffins of dead soldiers. With no middlemen, Frank's dope, called Blue Magic, is 100% pure on the streets of Harlem. Frank organizes his immediate family and cousins in ancillary posts--or fronts--throughout his drug network, from processing, measuring, and packaging, to receiving and distribution. Because Frank carries himself conservative and low-key, he's able to avoid the cops.<br /><br />Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a persistent New Jersey Cop determined to find out who's taken over Bumpy's turf. For a while, Frank is invisible. Then, one night he makes a big mistake. He shows up at an Ali fight in full regalia, draped from head to toe in mink and chinchilla, and festooned in diamonds and gold. He's shaking hands with the movie stars, the boxers, and the Mafia figures. Richie Roberts spies all of this from a distance through his binoculars--now the cops know who has taken over Bumpy's turf.<br /><br />Richie, however, has his own problems; he's a poor and honest cop. Discovering almost one-million dollars in the trunk of a car, Richie does the wrong thing and turns in the money without divvying it up with the force. His wife is leaving him because he makes peanuts as an honest cop.<br /><br />Both Richie and Frank are opposite sides of a coin: want of money disrupts Richie's life; wealth is not enough to prevent Frank's marriage and family from disintegrating. Richie's on the right side of the law, and Frank's on the wrong side of the law. Both lose everything.<br /><br />From the music, the sets, the cars, and the costumes, American Gangster is solid entertainment all the way.</p></body></html>

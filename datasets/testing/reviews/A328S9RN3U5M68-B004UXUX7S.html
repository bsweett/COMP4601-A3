<meta name="summary" content="An Extended Soap Opera"></head><body><p>Yes, the story is worth telling (from a book by Kaui Hart Hemmings) and the study of contemporary family life with all its flaws is commendable, and yes, George Clooney submerges himself in a role that is anything but his usual romance hero roles, but it seems that the ideas presented could have been condensed into an hour long movie for television instead of spread over 2 hours of interminable Hawaiian music backed vistas of the islands. The film appeals to a lot of people and that is satisfying to note that movie goers care enough about end of life issues and flawed parenting skills to support the ideas buried in this extravaganza.<br /><br />Matt King (George Clooney though looking unkempt and sloppy is solid in a an introspective and subdued performance) is a real estate attorney who happens to be the controlling descendant in a family whose ancestors date back to the days of Hawaiian kings: the family owns a large parcel of land they plan to sell to become instantly wealthy, a move the Hawaiians find disturbing as the influx of commercialism would destroy the native beauty of their island. Matt's wife Elizabeth is critically injured in a boating accident and is in a coma, not only affecting Matt emotionally but also pointing up the fact that he must assume full parental duties in coping with his two rather outrageous daughters - Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in a career making brilliant role) and chubby troublesome Scottie (Amara Miller). He brings Alex home from the boarding school she has been attending in an attempt to make her less sociopathic (she has fought seriously with her mother, drinks to excess and behaves badly) but she come with her loopy friend Sid (Nick Krause, another fine performance) who ends up being not unlike Matt.  Alex tells Matt the Elizabeth was having an affair, a note that shocks Matt and sets him on a quest to discover who gained his wife's attention. When he discovers the boyfriend was a married real estate broker Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) whose wife Julie (Judy Greer) Matt meets on the beach the attempt to bring closure to this portion of Matt's life, as Elizabeth is taken off life support machines, opens windows of communication between Matt and his daughters, with Sid who isn't as loopy as Matt perceived, with Elizabeth's parents (Robert Forster and Barbara L. Southern who embodies Alzheimer's Disease well), and most of all with himself. He gains courage to respect his heritage of Hawaiian land, dismisses his family's greed (from which Brian Speer would have benefited), and becomes an enlightened and emotionally more mature man.<br /><br />THE DESCENDANTS is a worthy film with a few good performances and a star turn for Clooney and Woodley, but oh, turn off that interminable Hawaiian music that drowns the story like a tsunami!

<meta name="summary" content="poorly cast, pointless plot"></head><body><p>I have no idea how a movie with such a large budget like "Sky Captain" gets the green light to go forward.  The movie takes you on a whirl-wind trip from New York to Nepal to a hidden island in the Atlantic with the purpose of saving the world from a mad scientist.  Setting aside the fact that this is a tired plot, there is no convincing motivation for the scientist's actions.  Supposedly he is building a space ship to function as a Noah's Ark in order to start a new world, but he is going to blow up the Earth just for spite?  The movie does capture that 1930's Buck Rogers feel quite well-perhaps a bit too well with bad acting and cheesy special effects brought along as well.  Jude Law is poorly cast as the lead hero.  He is completely unconvincing as an action star. Of course, his character bumbles through the movie and needs saving several times.  I've never seen a lead action hero accomplish so little in a story.  Gwenneth Paltrow plays an annoying career-driven reporter and her acting is surprisingly bad.  Angelina Jolie is competent is a very minor role.  Not only was I disappointed with this movie, but also bored as well despite all the action.  This one is not even worth renting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Phoenix and Witherspoon "Walk The Line""></head><body><p>From the opening moment when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) stares reminiscently at a saw blade, "Walk the Line" goes for the heart as it paints a vivid portrait of the Man in Black and woman, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) who saved his life.  The films' biopic clich&eacute;s (drugs and darkness to redemption, divorce to true love, unreasonable christian guilt to transcendent peace) aren't what do it, but the dynamic and deeply felt acting of Phoenix and Witherspoon.  The chemistry these two achieve, aided immeasurably by director James Mangold and music guru T-Bone Burnett, is magnetic.  Phoenix reflects Cash's demons and scarred soul, his eyes stark windows into Cash's wounded but then redeemed heart.  And Reese Witherspoon is dynamite as the sassy and strong-willed June Carter, who dealt with her own marital difficulties as she fell for the man who had her at "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."  The pair own the movie.  However, they owe two supporting players a load of credit.  Robert Patrick is terrific as Cashs' uncaring father, matching Phoenix blow for blow in a pivotal thanksgiving scene where long held resentments stemming the death of Cash's older brother simmer up to the surface.  And Gennifer Goodwin as Cash' first wife is stellar as well, playing the woman who bore the brunt of Cash's drug abuse and infidelity.  A biopic that resonates, "Walk The Line" sticks with genuine emotion.  Hand over the Oscars now.</p></body></html>

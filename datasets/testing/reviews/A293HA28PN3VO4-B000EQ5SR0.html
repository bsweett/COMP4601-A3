<meta name="summary" content="Very cool visuals/great departure for Charlize Theron"></head><body><p>The visuals in this movie are definitely eye candy, with the scenery and futuristic buildings and conceptual designs enticing. Charlize Theron as a model, has a mold to break,and she's done it previously with roles such as Monster, Devil's Advocate and others, so I enjoyed her in this role. However, the story is a bit slow moving, and not conceptually unlike other movies already created (Minority Report, 1984, Demolition Man). The PQ and AQ are 4/5 on this HD DVD, and it's worth a buy if you like the slower paced, atmospheric, and dreamscape type feel of some of the futuristic shows/movies releases on the big screen.</p></body></html>

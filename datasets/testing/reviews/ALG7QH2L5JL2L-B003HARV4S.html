<meta name="summary" content="A charming, subtle romance"></head><body><p>Even though it is already out on DVD, I'm glad I saw it on a proper cinema screen. No doubt I'll get the DVD, but it's one of those flicks you'd want to see at 'the movies' at least once.<br /><br />Warning: SPOILERS FOLLOW, but nothing that gives the plot away too much.<br /><br />It's difficult to add to the good things said about this movie, but I'll try, leaving the most important bits till last.<br /><br />About the cinematography. Beautifully done, but not cloyingly so, or in a way that makes it get in the way of the story. After the intro, which is rather long and arty--this isn't a criticism, just an observation--the images become unobtrusive. The way it was done was reminiscent of the way Ridley Scott used images in The Duellists; effectively and many had the quality of paintings, but they always enhanced and never distracted or occasioned that annoying "what great cinematography" effect, which usually takes you out of the story for sometimes distractingly long periods.<br /><br />The story. It matters, but the whole effect of the 'surprise' has been overemphasized in most reviews that talk about it. It's not about sudden revelation, but about completion of a carefully spun web is deception. Personally, I wasn't surprised, and I wasn't looking to be surprised. I just loved the way things came together in complete closure--not just Eisenheim's deception, but also the strands of inevitable cosmic justice and a sense of final equipoise and closure. Anybody watching with any amount of sensitivity should see it all coming, and those who don't see it will still sense it. It's all very subtly done; and as such it creeps up on you, and you don't even know consciously that it's there. So, it's not the 'surprise', such as there is, that matters, but the wholeness of it all and the watching of it unfold.<br /><br />The whole 'mystery' thing and its 'supernatural aspects was also been overemphasized in many reviews. There is, to my mind, no suggestion that an interpretation allowing for a life-after-death explication of the whole story was intended. If anybody thinks there is, they should consider themselves a part of those members of Eisenheim's audiences who thought that his tricks were evidence for the survival of the spirit. This is evidenced clearly by a single and unambiguous statement of Eisenheim to Sophie, which was as much a declaration of his love for her as it was a denial of the validity of the 'supernaturalist' or 'spiritualist' interpretation of his tricks and the denouement of the story. Reason why people miss it, is that the context of the statement distracts from its significance with regards to other areas. It's one of the ways in which this movie is very subtle and devious about revealing itself. A truly masterful script.<br /><br />There's a social theme interleaved into all of this, usually described as being a 'class' issue. I would not put it that crassly. It does however have to do with democracy, in the sense of the notion that in some way everybody has a right to be heard, no matter their social standing may be. This again is brought out clearly in the Crown Prince's final soliloquy, when faced with Inspector Uhl's revelations and his imminent fall from grace. Here, too, though, subtlety and focus on character took the place of pat social proselytizing.<br /><br />Romance is the driving force of the movie. Nothing at all would have 'happened', and Eisenheim would never have returned to Vienna, had it not been for Sophie.<br /><br />Eisenheim: I was meant to return. I just... I kept thinking I'll find around the next corner.<br />Sophie: What?<br />Eisenheim: A real mystery. I saw remarkable things but the only mystery I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you.<br /><br />Nothing more need to be said about that. The other stuff was just backdrop and devices. The fuel for the fire was love; not some social or spiritual agenda nonsense.<br /><br />In line with the rest of the movie, the one and only love/sex scene between Eisenheim and Sophie was both subtle and yet intense, both in terms of interaction as cinematography; making everything that happened there unabashedly romantic and therefore intensely erotic without requiring over-explicitness. There is an inherent difficulty in movies--and novels--where two characters come together in a love scene, as we know they must in order for things to proceed. (Unless the event is placed at the end as the denouement, but his was not the case here). The characters have to at least confess their love; probably do more and kiss; maybe go beyond that and 'consummate'. The danger of making this whole process almost perfunctory--as in it being necessary, and so it just has to be there; which takes a lot of the zing out of it--is great. And there's always the danger of there either being too little, which leaves the viewer unsatisfied, or too much--especially of explicit sex--which in this context would have been out of character for the tone of the film. There's also the danger of a love-scene just being a sex-scene; a common failing nowadays, in film and novel alike.<br /><br />The Illusionist gave us exactly what was needed. A lead-up which made us expect something of what was about to happen, but nobody quite knew what shape it would take; a coming together after the briefest of recrimination for a past disappointment; a panning away from the act itself with some fairly non-explicit and very creative pans across part of nude human anatomy; and, most importantly, an after-the-fact lingering, not just on the romance, but on how it connected to everything else, past, present and future, disappointments and hopes.  And never in all that was there a moment's doubt that this, and nothing else, was what the movie was all about. Which means we end up actually believing--even if a twitch of "oh, here it comes" is there at the start, with maybe a "are they going to screw this up?"--what these people are doing, and despite the apprehension lurking in some of us, like me, about being taken out of the story because this is another sex-scene, we come out of it realizing that it is in truth a love-scene and one that seamlessly connects to everything else in the story.<br /><br />Lastly, cynics be warned: The Illusionist is at its core a cunningly-disguised feel-good-movie. It doesn't have a cynical bone in its body, even though it doesn't see the world through rose-colored glasses either. But one doesn't have to, and one can still not be a cynic.<br /><br />There will, of course, be cynics who love this movie, though they'll probably strenuously deny that they were captured by its charm, rather than its intellectual messages, arty cinematography, crafty plot--or whatever cynics think they need to put up as good explanations for liking this flick. Sentimentality is unfashionable among the 'educated' and enlightened who know what's real and what isn't. The Illusionist is an excellent antidote to the poison of deluded intellectualism--ironically working its effect by a pretension of appeal to the intellect.</p></body></html>

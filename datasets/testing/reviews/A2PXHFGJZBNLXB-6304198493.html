<meta name="summary" content="Entertainingly twisty modern film-noir mystery"></head><body><p>I will be brief about Bryan Singer's THE USUAL SUSPECTS. It is often classified as a modern film noir, but though it isn't the equal of great modern film noirs as CHINATOWN and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, on its own terms it is a well-made, entertainingly twisty little mystery. It has good performances all around (Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for basically bringing a welcome wit and energy to a generic narrator role---well, at least it seems generic for most of the movie), and Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar-winning screenplay offers deliciously hardboiled dialogue and, especially, some genuinely startling plot twists---with the final twist being the most shocking of all. Personally, I was able to accept that controversial final twist a bit more easily than many others did---it certainly made for great theater, if you know what I mean. Now, whether it truly stands up upon repeated viewings is a more difficult question. All in all, a very good, not great, thriller, but suspenseful and entertaining enough to be worth a viewing or two---and I'm sure most people who watch it once will feel compelled to watch it again.

<meta name="summary" content="One of My Favorite Films"></head><body><p>Why is CHOCOLAT a favorite film? Please don't ask me why. I was really enamored by Johnny Depp, was studying French art and had a trip to France planned with my school at the time of this film's release. Juliette Binoche is really fantastic in this film. The film itself is so viewable and continues to be so on repeated viewings. I think the lure is how Juliette Binoche's character has such an effect of the townspeople bring out all their repressions. However, Binoche being just as human as the rest is affected by Depp's arrival. Without being deep, I just think this film tells us something about who we are and helps us explore our own ambitions and frailties. I really like this movie.</p></body></html>

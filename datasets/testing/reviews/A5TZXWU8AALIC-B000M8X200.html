Superman is sent to earth by a white-haired, white-dressed glowing Marlon Brando.  He grows up in humble surroundings.  At 18, he leaves home to go to a desolate location to find himself.  "Twelve years later," which makes him 30-years-old when he announces himself to the world as a super man.<br />(As Perry White rants, the reporter who gets his first interview will get the most important story since "God talked to Moses").<br />Little touches, I know, but I thought it was interesting to notice now.<br /><br />Actually, what I always remembered was Gene Hackman's funny performance as Lex Luthor.  The two lines my friends still quote are:<br />"It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to move those legs."<br />And, "You were followed again...in spite of those cat-like reflexes."<br />The special effects may look dated and the romance part is a bit much for a comicbook movie, but Hackman is hilarious and Luthor's "real estate" plot is the most inspired criminal enterprise since Auric Goldfinger tried to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox.<br /><br />The extras are great.  Watching the various actresses doing screen tests, you can see how Margot Kidder really nailed the role.  The others were good but the chemistry is there with Reeve and Kidder.<br /><br />Although it's probably lost on young people today, I loved the shot of Clark Kent running up to a phone booth and looking annoyed at the half-booth (anyone born since this movie came out would not remember that phone booths were once big enough for a man to change clothes in).</p></body></html>

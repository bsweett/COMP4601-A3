They were hinting at something different and intriguing, but the reviewers appeared reluctant to admit they were bowled over by the film. I tend to be distrustful of reviewers who "love" a film since it usually reflects the movie might be a little too different and might just be trying to hard to do something new. "Slevin" doesn't try to reinvent the genre (whatever it might be in this case), but it does certainly present sharper portrayals of prototypes we have encountered before, and there is also much more care given to a storyline that could easily baffle audiences. Instead, here is a film that delivers, with a very satisfying payoff!! 2006 has definitely given us outstanding work by Bruce Willis, an actor that manages to prove he is very reliable, versatile, and quite talented in some very unorthodox vehicles ("Pulp Fiction", "16 Blocks"). He now embodies the epitome of cool, with a performance that shows he can put enough energy to keep this very unpredictable tale going.<br /><br />The movie is an ensemble piece, and Bruce stands out as one of the mysterious pieces in the movie. There is great work by both Freeman and Kingsley who are two of the most versatile and best actors of their generation. When they are in their separate scenes they dominate the screen, when they are both together, the results are explosive. Lucy Liu is sweet and quite effective as the romantic performer. Josh Harnett makes a bid again for stardom in a performance that shows the right script can do wonders for talent like his.<br /><br />Going through the elaborate screenplay requires multiple viewings, but watching it for the first time can be a very enjoyable ride. It is only fair to say that any of the classic Greek tragedies certainly provided inspiration for the multiple twists and clever plot lines that hold the story together. The screenplay is the work of writer who understands background and depth are necessary to create interesting characters.<br /><br />Be prepared to see the multiple sides of the underbelly of society, and how deceptive looks and appearances can be. Also some stereotypes will be shattered as the writer allows its audience to have fun along the way. "The Usual Suspects" was only the introduction to the wildest ride of the year. Hope this is remembered later in the year because this is outstanding film-making, and whoever said that being bad doesn't pay, might not be rethinking that appreciation.</p></body></html>

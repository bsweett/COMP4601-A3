<meta name="summary" content="SUPERB Acting, but Shanley better writer than director"></head><body><p>Having seen the play on tour with the original Broadway lead actor, Cherry Jones, I was anxiously awaiting this release. In a somewhat different way, Meryl Streep is exceptional in the film's lead role. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is equally brilliant in his role. But the film lacks some of the tension of the stage production, whose cast consisted of just four actors. Playwright John Patrick Shanley "opened" of the story with his film adaptation. He added many more characters - quite a few are superfluous - and brought it outside the Catholic School. More importantly, he added extra events that seem contrived. When Sister Beauvier (Streep) does something wrong there is a clap of thunder - or the lights go out. When Shanley wants to build suspense he brings in a strong wind. He wants the viewer to know that God is "not pleased" or "Something terrible is about to happen". These moments are so obvious that you are distracted by the IDEAS that Shanley has  put into the words that his characters speak.<br /><br />But let me not dissuade you from seeing this DVD. The acting is SUPERB from all the main characters. The films FIVE Oscar nominations certainly support this. Shanley was nominated - but for the screenplay (well deserved); not as a Director.<br /><br />The bonus features are interesting but often spend a lot of time showing scenes from the film, which you have already seen. This is becoming common practice and a 10 minute "featurette" will often only have six minutes of new material. I have not taken the time to listen to Shanley's complete commentary track.<br /><br />Highly recommended, specifically for the acting, but also for the script if you have not previously seen the stage version.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

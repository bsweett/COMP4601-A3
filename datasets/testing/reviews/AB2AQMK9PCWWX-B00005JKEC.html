<meta name="summary" content="S'OK, But..."></head><body><p>....not the best Denzel performance I've seen (I take the view that the Academy gave him a 'body of work' Oscar for work he should have gotten the statue for in other, more powerful roles for the one he received on this one.), nor the worst. Nor is the corrupt cop thing anything new. Ain't people seen any one of those made for tv cop dramas or moovys like "Internal Affairs", "Q and A", "Serpico"? This is cool in that it's nice to see Denzel have a less than good-guy role and do it well. But, a blistering, powerful story? I recall parts of "Q and A" made me really cringe. This made me laugh at a few of those lines Denzel shot at the rookie, but I have seen many moovys that were about corrupt cops and their actions that actually got under my skin.</p></body></html>

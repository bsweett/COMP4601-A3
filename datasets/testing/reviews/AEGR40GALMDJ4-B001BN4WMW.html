<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Drama.  Mel Gibson's best!"></head><body><p>This is by far one of the best medevil dramas I have ever seen.  The story sweeps you away to a time of honor and courage.  Mel was perfect for the role of William Wallace.  Personally I think he should've taken home the Oscar for his fine acting abillities, but Nick Cage was a great choice for the award.  The epic battle sequences were amazing and the set direction and look the movie had was wonderful. Five Stars</p></body></html>

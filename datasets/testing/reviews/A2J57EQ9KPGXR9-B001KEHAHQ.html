To be honest, I was never a big fan of the original movie but I could watch it without an air sickness bag, unlike this mess.<br /><br />Its not funny. One ridiculous pratfall followed by a stupid joke after stupid joke. Nothing is worse than this type of "comedy". Included in this train wreck is a hip-hop hoochie, Beyonce something-or-other, looking more bored than the audience.<br /><br />Don't Bother.</p></body></html>

The zombies have evolved and have become smarter since the outbreak in the original. The poor people are living on the streets and fighting back against the zombies. The rich and powerful people live in a huge skyscraper called Fiddler's Green. Mr. Kaufman is the main boss who has extreme power over everyone. Riley, Charlie, and Cholo take a huge tank called Dead Reckoning and kill zombies and raid towns for supplies. When Cholo wants a room in Fiddler's Green and Kaufman turns him down, Cholo and his team steal Dead Reckoning while zombies are taking over the town. Kaufman asks Riley to get Dead Reckoning back. Riley, Charlie, Slack, and Pillbury retreive Dead Reckoning with no intentions of giving it back to Kaufman. The zombies start eating the townspeople, showing some awesome zombie gore! If you love zombie flicks, and George A. Romero, you'll love LAND OF THE DEAD!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great retro fun"></head><body><p>This is a 21st century impression of a 1980s impression of a 1930s impression of the 21st century. Unwinding that, it's a story about a future that was imagined in the 1930s of 1940s, in the black and white Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers films. The visual style is reasonably true to that era, down to the black and white look. That was the look that's been retroactively colorized since the 1980s, sometimes badly, and that paint-by-numbers color style is used here.<br /><br />The style works, and I expect to see a lot of imitations, even though this is already an imitation of the colorizers' imitation of real color movies. The palette included only a warm brown, for skin tones, and a blue, for sky, buildings, and most everything else. The reddish lipstick on Polly, the female lead, may have been the only exception to that two-dimensional color scheme.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the acting was pretty two-dimensional as well. For example, once Polly's character was set, she'd wear those spike heels everywhere, even through forests and rubble-strewn disaster sites. Frankie (Angelina Jolie) put words to my thoughts upon seeing Polly for the first time: "What's THAT?"<br /><br />Well, I just came for the adventure and for the incredible visual style. The adventure was passable, and the style has the advantage of novelty. It's a popcorn movie, modern and retro at the same time. If that's all you expect, you may like it.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

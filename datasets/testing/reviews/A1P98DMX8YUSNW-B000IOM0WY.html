<meta name="summary" content="About one-third car chase, so beware ..."></head><body><p>I'm sure that the MiniCooper car company had to pay a lot for the product placement here since it's then-new Minis are the real stars of this 2003 remake of a 1966 Michael Caine heist flick. The plot is some nonsense about $37 million worth of gold bars changing hands back and forth among criminals. The scenes of both a safe and then an armored car dropping through buildings and roadways are somewhat original, so I will give the filmmakers that. I haven't seen the original, so I don't know what they did in 66. Beware that most of the final third of the movie is really just a chase and it does grow tedious at times. There's not much depth to this, but you might like it if you enjoy heist movies.</p></body></html>

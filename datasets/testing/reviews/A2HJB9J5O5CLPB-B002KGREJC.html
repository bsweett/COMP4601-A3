I wish women too drunk or stupid to know when to say "no" would, but then we'd have a perfect world. (Naturally, they should never say no to me.) I liked Juno. All the characters are appealing and real enough. I particularly enjoyed Juno's dad and tough cookie-step-mom. I thought Jason Bateman hit the right notes as an immature rock and roll wanna be married to a serious yup woman, Jen Gardner. I'm glad he didn't put an aggressive move on Juno because this wouldn't be a feel good flick anymore.<br /><br />The Dawson Creek, super smart teen characters with big vocabularies, well, I don't know. Sometimes Juno was way to smart to have been so stupid, so it works against the script. On the other hand, brilliant people do adolescent disasters too. My guess is: the film would have been fine if Juno and her girlfriend had average every day teen vocabs.</p></body></html>

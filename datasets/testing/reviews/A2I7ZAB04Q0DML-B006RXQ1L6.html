With a supporting cast featuring other Hollywood A-List actors like John C. Reiley, Lucy Liu, and the fabulous Queen Latifah, its no wonder that this movie went on to achieve the pinnacle of fame as it swept its way through the Academy Awards this past year.<p>The story, set in the roaring 20's Chicago of gangster fame, is the tale of Roxie Hart (Zellweger), an ambitious unknown singer whose hunger for fame and fortune leads her into the arms of a man who promises to get her the connections she needs.  Later, when she learns that he is has been leading her to sleep with her, she shoots him in a moment of anger.  Her husband, unaware of his wife's extra-marial affairs, takes responsibility for the crime until he learns the other man is actually the same man who recently sold them furniture.  Roxy is incarserated, where she meets famed singer and dancer, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), who is also in prison for the murder of her husband and her sister.<p>The musical, which is filmed brilliantly in opposing counter-point of real life incident and elaborately staged jazz song-and dance numbers that narrate the story, is cleverly drawn together, blending musical fantasy with the fascinating story of these women's struggle for fame from inside the "slammer."<p>Desperate to escape public execution, Roxy implores the assistance of Matron "Mama" Morton (Latifah), the prison headmaster whose corruptability is equal to her authority.  She puts Roxy in touch with Billy Flynn (Gere), top criminal lawyer in Chicago, and the man who is already representing Velma, to get her out.<p>The music is sizzling, sultry, sexy, as are the costumes and the actors that work these numbers.  One of the most impressive surprises in this film is that all of the actors sing and dance their own numbers.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is dynamic, performing like a veteran of the Broadway stage with a confidence that equals her talent.  She is beautiful in the role of Velma, and was perfectly cast.  Zellweger and Gere also nail their numbers, bringing a vitality and a sexual tension to their characters that make this movie work as a musical.  One of the surprise performances in this production was that of John C. Riley, who plays Amos Hart, Roxy's estranged and dumb-witted husband.  He brings a sensitivity and innocence to the performance that gives his character as much vitality as that of any of the larger roles in this film. <p>Running a little over an hour and a half, this is a fabulous film production of a legendary musical.  It is no wonder why this film has had the acclaim that it has.  It is sure to dazzle, entertain, an all that jazz....<p>Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

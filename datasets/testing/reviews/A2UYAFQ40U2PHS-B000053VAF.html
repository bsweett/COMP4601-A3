<meta name="summary" content="Existence for dummies...."></head><body><p>I think Jonathan Rosenbaum, film critic for the Chicago Reader, said it the best.  This is a film about spirituality aimed at 11 year olds.  I found the film extraordinarily simplistic, boring, and obnoxious.  The charcters are really annoying, and the performances are quite bad (with Jason Lee coming across the worst as a devil like dude).  Affleck and Damon's characters end up being another variation on the know it all, smug, Gen X type who thinks he has all the answers, and enjoys pointing out everyone else's faults.  This was supposed to be Smith's "profound" film, but he's way out of his depth here.  Gen X filmmakers like Smith are not known for tackling big subjects, and when Kevin tries to tackle the heavy questions of existence here, he fails miserably.  Even though the film is a comedy, it still fails to really get into anything worthwhile.  It comes across as "existence for dummies".  Smith's previous film, Chasing Amy (his best in my opinion), is actually more profound than this film is.  It's an overly silly movie about religion.  I was just offended by the bad acting and filmmaking, not by the so-called "blasphemy" of the film.  The Catholic Church who protested this film were fools for doing so.  There's nothing worth bothering about here.</p></body></html>

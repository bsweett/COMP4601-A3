<meta name="summary" content="the 1984 of our time"></head><body><p>this movie borrows heavily from the george orwell classic "1984".the guy from "1984" is even in it.its all about this guy in a "funky french guy meets the joker" mask who uses terrorist methods to try and overthrow big brother.before you blow a gasket over the word "terrorist",hes not a kamikaze psycho in a turban hes more I.R.A. like.in other words hes fighting the good fight.this guy also has some sort of super powers they never really explain.he can dodge bullets like they do in "the matrix" and is super fast like "spider man".he is really good with a knife also.the chick in this movie is padme from star wars:episode 1-2 and 3.this movie combines elements of action,politics,sci fi and drama.it also has a "violent opera" feel to it like "a clockwork orange".its a really good sleeper film that wasnt hyped relentlessly while i was trying to watch wrestling but still delivered.so that was cool.this movie is good and  should see it!</p></body></html>

Everybody did a real good job of turning against each other, because of the religious freak, Mrs. Carmody. David; his son, Billy, Amanda, Dan, and Irene soon become the only sane people in the store. Everyone else slowly goes crazy. Will anyone escape the creatures? If you love Stephen King movies, and hilarious endings, you'll love THE MIST!!!</p></body></html>

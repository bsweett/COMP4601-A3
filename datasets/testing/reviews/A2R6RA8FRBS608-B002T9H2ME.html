<meta name="summary" content="one terrific sci-fi thriller with mystery and drama as well"></head><body><p>Despite the fact that this was filmed in just 33 days, Moon is an excellent motion picture. As others have noted, it was at first easy to believe that Moon would be all too similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey; but I too am happy that I was wrong. Yes, there are some similarities but the plot is so different and the sci-fi/horror/thriller elements so original and inventive that Moon works on all levels. The acting is superb and the casting was very well done; the cinematography and the choreography work wonders for the film. The script was well written and the action move along at a good pace although they could have edited this down just a few minutes to make the action and the plot a bit tighter. However, this is a minor detail.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who, at some point in the future, has been assigned to a three year solo mission on the far side of the moon to "harvest" helium-3 for cleaner energy; and he sends it all back to Earth as his bosses at Lunar want him to do. Sam has only his robot named "GERTY" for company; and yes, there are some similarities between GERTY and HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey but by the end of the picture you'll see that these are two different robots.<br /><br />With just two weeks left to go, Sam is eager to go home. Indeed, he is so lonely that he talks to his plants and watches with frustration the sporadic one way-feed, incoming only video messages he gets from his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and their young daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw) back on Earth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one day on an expedition outside the base, Sam has an accident with his vehicle and he awakens to find himself in the base's infirmary. It's not long after that Sam discovers that there is in fact someone else on the base with him after all--and who is also named Sam (Robin Chalk)! This shocking discovery creates riveting drama with thriller features and creativity that impressed me very much. Although it may seem as if I've given too much away, there's actually much, much more to the plot and I won't provide spoilers to keep it interesting for you.<br /><br />The DVD comes with some nice extras. There are two optional running commentaries; and I particularly liked the "making of" featurette. In addition, Kevin Spacey does a great job of providing the voice for GERTY.<br /><br />Moon is one of those rare, somewhat softer sci-fi thrillers that gradually pulls you in and then never lets you go until the very last moment of the picture. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy sci-fi, thrillers with drama and even mysteries. You won't be disappointed!</p></body></html>

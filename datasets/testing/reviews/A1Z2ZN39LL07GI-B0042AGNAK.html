I see a big figure in box and dvd was on sculpture. Why i buy this edition because i like this figure. Picture quality 4/5 and have 2 disc at this edition. of course if you want to compare the blu-ray version of the audio specs are very different. Blu-ray audio is uncompressed audio compared to dvd. If u like this figure u can buy if cheap. but if u like picture and highly audio u can choose blu-ray version</p></body></html>

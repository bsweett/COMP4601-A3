The movie is much more colorful than I remember.  Very clear, crisp picture.  No grain.  Even though most of the movie is dark, it looks phenomenally great.  The sound quality is great too.<br />*Includes both the theatrical cut and director's cut of the movie.  Also has a bunch of special features, some of which came from the older DVD release (essays and notes), and others that are brand new (documentaries, new commentaries, and some other stuff).  All of this is on disc one; disc two is a digital copy.<br />*The movie itself has some good action and special effects.  Moreover, it has a very slick and interesting tech-noir style and production design (overall, it's like a retro version of "Blade Runner").<br />*The story is interesting.  It didn't make total sense when I first saw it years ago, but repeated viewings make things clearer.<br />*Characters are not bad.  Has a good cast.<br />*Pretty good writing; some memorable lines.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*As said above, storyline may be hard to get on first viewing.<br />*Kind of slow at parts (but if you like the style, it'll be interesting all the way through).<br /><br />The movie was a pleseant surprise when I saw its former DVD release years ago; it was stylish and had some great action and special effects (especially during the movie's finale).  Repeated viewings have been even more interesting.  The Blu-Ray is most worthwhile, for both its video quality and its array of special features.  Definitely reccomended to sci-fi fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hitmen on hiatus - a cleverly written, beautifully shot, dark comedy"></head><body><p>After bungling their latest job, two London-based hitmen are sent to the much quieter city of Bruges, Belgium to await instruction.  Ray is a cocky young gun, who can't relax and can't stand Bruges and can't wait to get away.  Ken is older and wiser, and wishes he could stay longer to take in the atmosphere and history of this medieval city.  Of course, initial impressions of this odd couple turn out to be incomplete, and things aren't going to work out quite like anyone wants, and the quaint city starts to get pretty crazy.  The real fun here is the cleverness of the dialogue, and the beautifully captured delights of the city don't hurt either.  It's a small, and fairly simple film, well told and clear, and worth watching.  Nothing profound here, but solidly entertaining, with shades of Tarantinoesque dialogue and Ritchie-esque stylings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="not impressed"></head><body><p>Having grown up in the disco era, with ABBA on the radio every ten minutes, I thought this would be an interesting and enjoyable movie.<br />I was wrong.<br />It tried too hard in some places, not enough in others, and plodded along for the most part.<br />The pretense was actually quite the setup for a good comedy. Strong actors was a good move also and the location was great! The unfolding of the plot was weak, at best. And it seemed some of the songs just didn't fit well to what was going on.<br />I'm not sure what I would have done differently here... the story was made to be wrapped around songs by the group ABBA. These songs weren't written for that purpose and therefore the fit just isn't quite right.<br />This is definitely a chick flick and geared for the teen section. Which I'm sure it will win over. Myself?  I watched it and returned it. Don't think I'll watch it again.</p></body></html>

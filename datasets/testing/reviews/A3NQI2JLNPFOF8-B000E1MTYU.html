In the last one, they changed the future. No terminators to come back in time....but for some reason John Conner has not vanished from existence yet, seeing as how he should never have been born.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Yeah, that movie made absolutely no sense. Let's do this like it should have been done with T2. Lets work with the ideas that Cameron crafted in the original Terminator before he stopped caring about his creations.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Yeah, forget changing the future....this one will end like it should.......with the machines destroying everything.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Brilliant!&quot;<br /><br /> I have a feeling that's exactly how that conversation went. From the very beginning of Terminator 3, we are treated to something that T2 lacked tremendously: a concept of fate. We see that John Conner was meant to meet Kate Brewster back when he was 13, but the terminators interfered. In the present, seemingly unrelated events (like a deer crossing the road), propel them back together again. This is the fate that James Cameron worked so hard to create....but then tried to destroy it in exchange for a 'happy Hollywood ending'.<br /><br /> No, the future cannot be changed...only delayed. Destiny will eventually have its way in this movieworld.....the only thing the characters can do is ride it out. But cheer up, John....at least you know you'll win in the end.......but then you'll get killed by a terminator. Oh, well...sorry.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stiller and Wilson take on the roles as Starsky and Hutch"></head><body><p>Owen Wilson (The Big Bounce, The Minus Man) and Ben Stiller (Along Came Polly, Zoolander) star as the main characters in this hilarious comedy about the two detectives, Starsky (Stiller) and Hutch (Owen) who team up to take on the evil drug lord, Vince Vaughn (The Locusts, Swingers). Along the way they encounter strange things and get into stranger situations, example a chinese kid wielding weapons. This is a movie where you expect the two stars to play the same roles they did in teh rest of their movies and they do that. This is the best of the Stiller movies that came out this year. Also starring Jason Bateman (Dodgeball, Arrested Development), Juliette Lewis (Old School, Natural Born Killers), Amy Smart (Campfire Tales, Road Trip), Carmen Electra, Brande Roderick (Dracula II: The Ascension) and a amusing camero by none other then Will Farrell (Elf, Old School). Paul Michael Glazer and David Soul appear at the end of the movie and if you dont know who they are then your stoopid. Directed by Road Trip and Old School director Todd Phillips. to quote Stiller and Owen in the movie..." I like your moves"..."I like your style"</p></body></html>

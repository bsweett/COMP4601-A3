<meta name="summary" content="Hard to feel bad for this guy"></head><body><p>This is a beautiful movie and easy to watch. My main problem with it is that the main character is just a selfish loser. He just up and leaves everyone to go off and live in the wild??? He can't get over his past... oh boo hoo. Spare me. A lot of people have issues to deal with from the past, we don't just quit on life to go into the wild and take a vacation. He wanted to write a book, therefore his trek wasn't all about being one with nature. Nah, he had plans in his mind. I was glad at the end when he is rotting in the same nature that he wanted to live in. Not to mention that this movie felt like it was ten hours long... 3 stars for the directing, the scenery and acting. The story isn't all that great and the only thing I got out of it is to make sure you don't eat meat that flies have landed on and not to eat random plants in the woods. Otherwise, I'll stick to my life and trying to make a better world for those people I care about. This is just another movie created by the Limousine Liberals.</p></body></html>

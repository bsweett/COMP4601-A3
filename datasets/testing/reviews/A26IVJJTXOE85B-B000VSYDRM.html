GET A LIFE!<br /><br />i saw "Run Lola Run" a long time ago but remember it being a very engaging and memorable film. I've seen ads for Perfume over a year and finally got around to seeing it and i have to say, i'm glad i did. This film is completely original and very engrossing. i thought the acting was exceptional and the psychology of the characters very deep and captivating. The cinematography was great as well, it created a very alluring atmosphere. I thought the concept and motivation for the killing was brilliant and i was completely moved by the film. i learned a lot about the art of creating perfume as well. I thought the ending was extraordinary and very original. i really didn't see that coming. this film is highly entertaining, intriguing and captivating. A very original story...</p></body></html>

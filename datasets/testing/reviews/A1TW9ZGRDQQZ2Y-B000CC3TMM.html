<meta name="summary" content="A Sequel That is Better than the Original?"></head><body><p>This happens rarely in film, but The Transporter 2 is much more focused and tighter than the original, which I also liked. Move over James Bond, because Jason Statham returns here as the ultra cool Frank Martin. What Bond does with guns and gadgets, Frank Martin does physically with his body and various appliances that may be lying around. The creative fight scenes are on par with the original with my favorite being the one with fire hose towards the end. I must admit that the whole plane scene contains some of the worst CGI I have ever seen and it nearly ruins that part of the movie. Like the 007 films, leave logic and realism at the door, so you can just enjoy the ride that The Transporter 2 takes you on.</p></body></html>

One may ask if it has even started to lose some of its charm. Short answer: no. It is still a great and moving story now, even after 45-odd viewings.<br /><br />Base on the true story of the Union's raising of the 54th Mass. Infantry, "Glory" takes the viewer into the life and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. As the commanding officer of the 54th, he has to deal with many obstacles, including indifference amoung the army at large, out-right racism and supply problems sponsored by that racism. Even his own Major, (played by Cary Elwes), fails at first to see any real combat value significance to the 54th.<br /><br />"Glory" has a cast of people who made the movie truly shine. Denzel WAshington is deservedly well-praised for his role as a bitter, hate-filled runaway who finds belonging in the ranks of the 54th. Thomas, Colonel Shaw's childhood friend, develops from one who tries to keep his old ties alive, to a soldier who knows his place in the army. Morgan Freeman shines also as the Regiment Sergeant Major, the glue that holds the men together and keeps them out of trouble many a time.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick was a surprise casting choice, and perhaps was not the best for the role, in my opinion. He comes across as a bit soft and pliable for a man who had to overcome such opposition and institutionalised bigotry. Perhaps the real Colonel Shaw was deceptively soft?<br /><br />Everything else about this movie was near perfect, from the acting, locations and music to the action and depth of the tale being told. For enthusiasts of the U.S. Civil War, this movie is hard to beat, and stands firmly in the tradition of great Civil War tales. Definitely, it is a must-see for anyone interested in the period. I will be definitely adding number 46 to the list soon.</p></body></html>

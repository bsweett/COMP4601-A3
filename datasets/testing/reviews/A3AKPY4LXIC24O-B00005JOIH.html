<meta name="summary" content="The Perpetuation of Stupidity"></head><body><p>Munich was one of 2005's best movies because it's ultimate message, for those who actually pay attention, was one of understanding.<br /><br />Munich is not anti-Semitic or anti-Islamic it is only anti-stupidity.  The repetitive and non-productive cycle of revenge that is present in all of society is the enemy that Speilberg sought to expose.<br /><br />Acknowledgement is made that both the Islamic extremists who perpetrated the terrorist plot at the Munich games and the Israeli assassin squad ordered to kill them are all products of the environment that reared them.<br /><br />This movie is often hard to watch and it spotlights the idiocy of issues like blind patriotism, murder, and religious zeal, when those issues are not counterbalanced with reason and intelligence.<br /><br />While I think Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are both better movies I believe Spielberg took greater risk by investing a heckuva lot of his personal beliefs into this film.  Obviously controversy would emerge with any film dealing with this subject matter, the fact that no sides are overtly taken is a true testament to Speilberg's genius.<br /><br />The only advocacy clearly nurtured in this film is for a worldwide push for peace, to set aside the differences that are more traditional than tangible, for nations to adhere to reason in diplomacy, rather than naked emotion.<br /><br />If you really want to know what Munich is ultimately about you'll have to wait until the very last shot in the film.  In the background there are two buildings that are no longer there.<br /><br />All things considered Munich is gutsy filmmaking by a filmmaker who certainly doesn't need to take risks, the result is heartbreaking and thought provoking.</p></body></html>

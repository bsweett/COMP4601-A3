Strong focus on relationships.<br />*Lots of funny but bleak satire (in true Paul Verhoven style!).  Similar to "RoboCop".<br />*Fascinating view of future society.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very gross; not for the squeamish.<br />*Themes are a little ambiguous.<br />*Altogether, a little corny and adolescent.<br /><br />This film definately entertains with its cool spaceships, alien bugs, and graphic war scenes.  With a cast of characters who seem childish, and with the director's bizzare style, the film seems very odd, extreme, and phony in a lot of places.  I'm also not sure what the film's message is supposed to be.  But whatever the case, it is enjoyable.</p></body></html>

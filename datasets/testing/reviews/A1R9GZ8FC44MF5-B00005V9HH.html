<meta name="summary" content="Surprising, and highly entertaining."></head><body><p>The story has twists and turns every which way, the performances are great all around, its suspensful and even if you know the ending before you see it, it will surprise you.  Its got some comedy, some drama, even alittle action (not much, but this is a suspense crime film).  Its truely one of the best crime films ever made, worthy of quite a few oscar noms at least, and i agree with it winning for screenplay and supporting actor.  9 out of a 10.</p></body></html>

It has been labelled as a "romantic-comedy" in nearly every other review, but I do not see it that way. Romantic, yes, but comedy, no. Although it has some humorous aspects, it is more a drama with tinges of fantasy and low-key science fiction. This movie can be partially described with "uns":<br /><br />Un-conventional -<br /><br />Odd use of lighting which is very harsh in many instances, including a lot of use of a single spotlight. Sets with forced-perspective. Snow-covered beaches.<br /><br />Un-usual -<br /><br />Odd subject matter (erasing memories). Fantasy transitions between sets - one example is Jim Carrey exits a bookstore directly into a friend's apartment. Transitions to past/present/future within a relationship. In one scene, Carry is playing two versions of his character in the same scene, requiring him to quickly change clothes behind the camera.<br /><br />Un-characteristic -<br /><br />Kate Winslet (with American accent) plays the typical Jim Carrey-type extroverted role, while usual physical-comedian Jim Carrey's character is somber and introverted.<br /><br />Un-predictable<br /><br />You don't know what is coming next.<br /><br />This is a complex movie that will reward the viewer with new details on multiple screenings. Many special effects (or tricks, actually) make it visually captivating. The acting is great and entertaining. The story is interesting and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Currently sits at #33 on IMDB's list.</p></body></html>

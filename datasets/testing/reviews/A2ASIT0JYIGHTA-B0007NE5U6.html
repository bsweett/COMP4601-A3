The sequel however, is annoying, not funny and lacks charm.  No longer is Bridget funny and charming, she is just an embarrassment to watch.<br /><br />The sequel starts out ok, but quickly relies on subplot after subplot to keep the viewer interested.  This actually made the film rather annoying as you constantly had to focus on yet another storyline happening.  Perhaps the director could tell the film wasn't working and wrote in more subplots.<br /><br />To me, the main problem with the film is that Bridget is no longer funny. You can only stretch the fat jokes so far. Also, the scene where she stormed into Darcy's chambers with a wet dress and hair was just too far fetched and not credible.  It was supposed to be funny, but ended up being a poor attempt by the Director to make us believe that a man of Darcy's calibre would be interested in a woman who storms in when he is in a meeting with his colleagues.  A similar scene occurs in the first ten minutes of the film.<br /><br />Hugh Grant's brief appearance in the film was an attempt to recapture the magic of the first. It failed. He was annoying in this film because he didn't fit in this time around.<br /><br />Overall, 2004's most eagerly awaited film turned out to be 2004's most disappointing film.  Please, do not make a third installment.</p></body></html>

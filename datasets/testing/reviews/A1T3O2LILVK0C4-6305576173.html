Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, who had previously collaborated on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BMY2LU">The Producers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Z4OXS">Blazing Saddles</a>, wrote the script together. This film is a superbly crafted parody of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CNRLQ">Universal Frankenstein</a> films.<br /><br />The story begins with young Doctor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) discovering that he has inherited his great-grandfather's Transylvanian mansion. Upon his arrival Dr. Frankenstein meets Igor (pronounced Eye-Gore), an eccentric servant with a hunched back. He is also introduced to the vivacious vixen, Inga who just wants "to have a roll in ze hay." Before long Frederick discovers the secret library of his infamous grandfather, Victor von Frankenstein and becomes totally obsessed with creating a "monster" of his own. Naturally this doesn't go over well with the local peasantry. After the monster goes on a rampage of terror (or more accurately a rampage of hilarity), the villagers form an angry mob and set out to destroy it. But don't worry, all's well that ends well in the world of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ESIK">Mel Brooks</a>.<br /><br />The gags in the film are hilarious (I won't ruin them for any of you yet to see the film). The satire is heightened by the brilliance of the set design, and by the black and white cinematography, which perfectly captures the look of classic horror films. The cast is terrific especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312337078">Gene Wilder</a> as the infirm Dr. Frankenstein, Marty Feldman as the zany hunchback Igor, Teri Garr as the delightfully ditzy assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's obnoxious and vain fianc&eacute;e, Kenneth Mars as the one-armed Inspector Kemp, Cloris Leachman as the mysterious Frau Blucher whose name incites terror in the hearts of all horses, and Peter Boyle as the mumbling monster. Also look for a memorable cameo appearance by Gene Hackman.<br /><br />As often as Young Frankenstein is referred to as being "the greatest comedy ever", it's odd that it never received any awards for its talented cast and crew. They certainly deserved them. There are few works of comedic genius out there today, for which I am grateful to Mel Brooks for giving us this loony masterpiece to watch again and again.<br /><br />The DVD features some great supplemental material including cast interviews, an audio commentary with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470225262">Mel Brooks</a> reminiscing about the making of the film, production stills, trailers and TV spots, a wonderful documentary, seven deleted scenes and an outrageously funny blooper reel (watch the documentary before the blooper reel for maximum effect).<br /><br />And remember next time a reanimated corpse is on the loose that "A riot is an ugly thing... und I think it is just about time that we have one!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perfect Halloween movie"></head><body><p>This film must've took a LONG time to make. To put it in terms: this runs in 24 frames so the character is posed 24 times for just one second of film and this film is roughly 70-90 minutes but the results look amazing. At times, you gotta ask yourself whether this was computer animated. <p>The story is that Jack Skellington, "the Pumpkin King" of Halloween Town has just finished a successful Halloween but he's finding it repetitive and redundant so he takes a long walk and finds trees with holiday symbols and he gets amazed by the one with a christmas tree but gets sucked into that world and literally he's floored by how amazing it is and rather than show people the tree, he figures he'll make christmas himself, ignoring a girl who loves Jack named Sally, who has a vision that his christmas will go down in flames. <p>These songs are just too damn catchy for their own good. Written and largely sung by Danny Elfman who supplies Jack's singing voice. And the voices are excellent and really compliment their characters, especially Jack's, he's got a cool voice.<p>As I write this, it's 10/31/02 so it's Halloween so whether you're having a Halloween party or just want a good movie to watch, pop this in.</p></body></html>

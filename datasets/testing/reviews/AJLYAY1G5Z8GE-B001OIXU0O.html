<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Musicals!"></head><body><p>Sophie, a 20 year old girl whose getting married, invites 3 men to her wedding hoping one of them is her father that she never met. They arrive, meet her mother after a long time, and they try with Sophie to figure out who is her real father.<br /><br />All the songs from the movie were originally composed by ABBA. Very nice and touching songs.<br /><br />However there were more songs than dialogue, which kind of made us bored after a little while. I also wished it didn't include these little inappropriate scenes because it could have been a great family movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was nice to watch. I rank it second after Moulin Rouge.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent continuation of an excellent series"></head><body><p>First of all, I like Matt Damon. He fits a certain role, it seems to me. He wouldn't do well in a suave role. He's Len Deighton's Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File, not Ian Fleming's Bond. And if the truth be known, brilliant actor that he is, I never saw Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne. But I do see Matt Damon. Muscled, confused, haunted. Reactionary. Bi and tri lingual. Maybe not highly intelligent but terribly well skilled in the art of killing. That's what Ludlum had him do. That was his raison d'etre. Killing.<br /><br />So here he's living like a recluse and the past reaches out and grabs him. The movie has a serene beginning, but after a few minutes of plant scenes, it's non stop action. Julia Stiles steals the show for the small time she's on film. We deserve to see more of her. And Joan Allen plays her part well as the woman manager-operative left with the mess of Treadstone.<br /><br />Can't wait for the third of the trilogy. Hope they keep Damon in it. 5 stars.

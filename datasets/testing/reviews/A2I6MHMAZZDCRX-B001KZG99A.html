<meta name="summary" content="Like the Tin Man, Iron Man Lacked Heart"></head><body><p>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a genius with technology.  He inherited Stark Enterprises from his father, and has turned it into the leader in international weapons.  He is wealthy beyond imagination, and lives the playboy life to a hilt, spending as much time as possible drinking, gambling, and pursuing anything in a skirt.<br /><br />On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, things go wrong and he is kidnapped by a gang of terrorists.  What he sees there changes his outlook on his business.  After three months in captivity, Stark manages to escape.  He returns home determined to change the direction of his company.  This does sit well with the board or Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), his father's partner.  Will the new suit he is building help him with his goals?<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is it is an origin story.  As a result, much of the movie is slow, even for someone like me who is unfamiliar with the character.  What we do get in the way of action scenes are wonderful and had me on the edge of my seat.  The climax didn't quite make sense, but that's worth noting only in passing.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the special effects were great, especially the shots from Iron Man's point of view.  And the robot assistants were very funny, proving a nice balance to some of the darker moments.<br /><br />The biggest problem the movie has is the characters.  Even with all the time spent creating Iron Man, we aren't given time to get to know the characters.  This is especially problematic for Tony who comes across as an egotistical jerk at first.  While his character softens, I never fully warmed up to him.  The other characters are only given one or two notes, and that isn't enough to make us truly care for any of them.<br /><br />Now this isn't a reflection on the top notch actors.  In addition to the two already mentioned, we've got Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow.  They all did the best job they could making the thin characters come to life.  I will admit that I couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr. and his past problems when looking at Tony.  It's more of a personal problem, but it was another stumbling block in any attempts to warm up to Tony.<br /><br />To me, the flaws were equal to the strengths, making this a fun but shallow superhero movie.</p></body></html>

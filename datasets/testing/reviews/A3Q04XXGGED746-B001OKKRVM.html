As a science teacher, I found it to be very useful for science classes. It teaches so much about basic ecology, the Antarctic environment, the life cycle of the Emperor Penguin, monogamous bonding in the animal world, and the dynamics of paternal involvement in child raising, etc.<br /><br />Warning: The cruelties of nature are shown in graphic detail, and this may upset some sensitive and younger viewers. There are scenes of eggs and embryos frozen and discarded, young penguin chicks killed by the cold, and predators attacking a group of young chicks.<br /><br />One is amazed to learn that penguins may walk 70 miles to find their mates. Or that even adult Emperor Penguins can only survive the coldest part of the Antarctic winter by huddling together. The viewer may be endeared by the sight of females and males exchanging the egg for warmth and protection in the space between their lower abdomen and their feet.</p></body></html>

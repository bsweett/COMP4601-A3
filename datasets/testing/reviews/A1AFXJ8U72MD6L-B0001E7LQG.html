Who'd of thunk? lol<br /><br />Most likely the best rom com of its year.<br /><br />Tale centers on a man close to 60, played by Jack Nicholasan, who has a thing for young women, finding that they don't have "baggage", as he puts it.  One of the girls he dates, Amanda Peet (i.e. from cancelled TV show JACK & JILL and a host of other feature films), takes him to a family summer cottage where he meets Peet's character's mother played by, wait for it, Diane Keaton.  Story then focuses on the two of them getting together, breaking up and taking a long and twisted road before he "gets it".  Also look for Keanu Reeves as the love interest of Keaton and the Frances McDormand (known as the leading lady in FARGO) as Keaton's hippy oh so feminist sister.<br /><br />Keaton was nominated by the AA for best actress but did not win it.  She did win it in the Golden Globes though.<br /><br />Excellent interweaving of music, especially with Maroon 5's SUNDAY MORNING which focuses on healing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not a good follow-up."></head><body><p>I loved the first POTC film. It was a masterpiece in story, effects, and acting. This film (along with A.W.E.) just did not have the same feel of the first, nor a plot that I got into. I'm just not a fan of this film. It deserves only one star for some good acting and special effects. My recommendation is that you stick with the original and not see the sequels.</p></body></html>

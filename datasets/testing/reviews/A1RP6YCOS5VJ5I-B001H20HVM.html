But what is Saw if it didn't have any of that in the film?<br /><br />What makes this movie so great is that this gives a story to who the Jigsaw Killer really is. In the first film, he is rarely seen and portrayed as some kind of monster. In this film, he is on almost the entire time giving his story and it makes him more human and actually a little sympathetic. That's the basic idea of the film, people trying to escape Jigsaw's game is only a minor side story and not a major plot like in the original. This story is really made just to tell you a little bit about who Jigsaw really is.<br /><br />Those people who had to solve a puzzle to live had an easy one to solve to the viewing audience. I figured out the answer fifteen mintues into the film, but it didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film. It's one of those things that if you don't figure it out by the end, you slap your forehead for not knowing how obvious it was saying "Of course!"<br /><br />The actors do a great job. Tobin Bell really shines in the film since he finally has a lot of speaking parts in the film. He makes the character very convincing, intellegent and like I said before, actually sympethetic to the point you kind of feel sorry for him.<br /><br />So overall, if you liked the first film, you will also like this one. Knowing Jigsaw more and seeing his human side is worth it alone, it puts a face on the character. But, I don't feel it is better than the first movie. Some of the things in this film were typical and not really original or rarely seen like what was in the first movie. I do recommend this film to fans, Saw 3 is right now being made and will be released this year and I welcome it</p></body></html>

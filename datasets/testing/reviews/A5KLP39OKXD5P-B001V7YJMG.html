<meta name="summary" content="A vampire film that will definitely surprise you!"></head><body><p>A very neat, decent film-making here. 'Let the right one in' is a vampire film that stays ahead of most vampire films, often witnessed by people. After witnessing brilliant performances from tho two main leads : Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson, all you can say is 'wow' and simply stare at these two children on the tv screen, specially Leandersson, who gives her almost every bit in her role, her facial expressions alone, easily make you read her mind, a similarly brilliant performance by Kare Hedebrant, who gives a genuine performance and you simply give out your heart to him. The feelings of friendship, love and sexual innocence portrayed by these two twelve year old children is something simply remarkable. The film, though slow paced sometimes, never looses its grip and maintains a horrifying atmosphere throughout. Worth watching.</p></body></html>

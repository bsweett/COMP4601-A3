<meta name="summary" content="On the inside looking out at the outside looking in...."></head><body><p>Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) is a burnt out X undercover narcotics officer with a painful past. A few years back...while involved in an undercover sting, things went horribly wrong; leading to the death of 2 of his team officers.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years later to New Years Eve and Jake now has a low stress level desk job at soon to be defunct "Precinct 13". He drinks and pops pills on the job in an apparent attempt to forget the memories of that horrible day and of his fallen comrades.<br /><br />This is the last night of operation at "Precinct 13", as it will close after New Years and the remaining officers are to be transferred to a newly built and bigger precinct across town.<br /><br />A blizzard is raging, and in an attempt to transfer some prisoners to another locale, the harsh weather conditions force some local officers driving a prisoner transport bus to make a pit stop at "Precinct 13" until the weather clears up. Along with 3 other lowly criminals comes Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) a high profile gangsta just busted for a cop killing.<br /><br />There are only 4  people at "Precinct 13" when the bus arrives. Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), soon-to-be retired Officer Jasper ( Brian Dennehy), Officer Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo), & police physcologist Dr Alex Sabian (Maria Bello) who was detoured from an earlier visit by the snow.<br /><br />Soon...all the officers find themselves fighting for their lives as assasins stake out the building from outside and try to weasel their way in. At first it is assumed that they are Bishops henchmen, looking to free him and help him escape. This quickly proves not to be the case, and the officers AND the prisoners find themselves working together to fight off the deadly intruders.<br /><br />"Assault on Precinct 13" is a formulaic action movie, but now a days, aren't all action movies that way? The film flows nicely, has some pretty intense shoot-outs, and some nice blood and gore to top it off. Hawke's and Bello's performances are the stand-outs, but they are accompanied by a well rounded cast of good actors.<br /><br />All in all, "Assault on Precinct 13" is a pretty decent and entertaining shoot-em up action flick. If you enjoy films of this nature, this one is worth at least a rental.</p></body></html>

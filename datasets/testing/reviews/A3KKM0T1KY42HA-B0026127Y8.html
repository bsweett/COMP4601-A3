<meta name="summary" content="Would You Mess With Ra's al Ghul? Are You Kidding?!"></head><body><p>"I Will Look for You. I WILL Find You. And I'll Kill You." You do NOT want to be the guy that Liam Neeson says that to in Taken.<br /><br />If you thought that Liam was bad (and by bad I mean gooood) as Ra's al Ghul in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC6A3E">Batman Begins</a>, wait 'til you see him as an ex-spy whose daughter is abducted while visiting Paris. Unfortunately for the abductors, Neeson was trained to "prevent bad things from happening." So when you combine a loving, overprotective father whose daughter has been abducted with a ruthless cold-blooded "preventer of bad things from happening," you'd better not be in his way.<br /><br />While some of the scenarios in Taken go a little over the top, the action is thrilling to watch, and Neeson is flawless in his role. I don't mean this to be a Neeson love-fest, but the fact is that the movie is 90% Neeson; he's on-screen in at least 90% of the scenes. It is indeed Neeson that takes Taken from being an average movie to being a really good movie.<br /><br />You won't fall asleep watching Taken. Surprisingly the movie is PG-13; even the Unrated Extended Cut doesn't cross the PG-13 line (as far as I remember anyway). There's lots of action. Good acting. A simple plot. Taken worked for me...I'd highly recommend it for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great!"></head><body><p>&quot;The Fugitive&quot; is a great movie, arguably one of the best action films ever made. The action scenes in this movie will leave you breathless, from the Bus-Train crash to the staircase chase scene. Althogh this isn't  my favorite Harrison Ford movie &quot;Air Force One&quot; is.  But he still  turns in a great performance(It was worth an oscar nomination if you ask  me). But it is Tommy Lee Jones who steals this movie he steals every scene  he is in and he deserved his academy award. A great movie.</p></body></html>

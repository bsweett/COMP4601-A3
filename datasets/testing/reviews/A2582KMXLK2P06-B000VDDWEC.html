Absolutely terrific and scarier than you can possibly imagine.<br /><br />Some people might not like the fact that there's not a whole lot in the way of action, but honestly, there's a good deal of action sequences despite the fact it's not necessarily a totally action-dominated film, and the atmosphere that builds up to those action sequences is pretty terrific too, because you get a sense of constant uneasy feelings around every turn.  You really feel the main characters as they struggle to find a way to safety and survive.<br /><br />The only complaint is that the film is REALLY dark so it's hard to see anything during the night settings.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the movie are how the monsters go crazy whenever they become infected, and it's just an exciting movie.</p></body></html>

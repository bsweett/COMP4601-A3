Or at least the smart ones... well choosing a life of kidnapping already dictates their stupidity so... maybe that doesnt work.. Uh! Liam does a good job making his part seem believable.. now this is a movie so some things may have worked out a bit better than real life.. but hey sometimes things work out...! SeE It</p></body></html>

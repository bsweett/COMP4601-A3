<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Finest Crime Thrillers Ever Made."></head><body><p>The film that made Humphrey Bogart a star, "The Maltese Falcon" stands to this day as a landmark in the crime & mystery genres of cinema. With its complex cast of characters, intricately concocted plot, and excellent direction and pacing courtesty of the great John Huston, it has stood the test of time to become a defining moment in cinema.<br /><br />Bogart stars as Sam Spade, a down on his luck, hard boiled private eye. When a lovely woman (Mary Astor) approahces him for help in finding a suspect who he considers dangerous, Spade's partner is put on the case. When his partner turns up along the dead along with the suspect he was trailing, Spade now becomes intent on finding the killer. He finds out that the woman who turned to him for help is a liar, but a relationship developes nonetheless. Spade learns through a variety of suspects (played by legendary character actors such as Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet) that The Maltese Falcon, a Spanish artifact from the time of of the 1500s', is the key reason behind his partner's murder. Each of these sordid characters will stop at nothing to get their hands on it, and this all leads to a shocking conclusion.<br /><br />"The Maltetse Falcon" is a wonderful film that features every actor at the top of their game. This three disc special edition comes with great sound and picture quality as well as a stunningly impressive array of bonus features. Highly recommended to all film fans.</p></body></html>

(But if Nicole Richie has it, then damn, so can I!) But I am interested in the whole idea of the "Son Of God" having a child. I went to the cinema to see Passion Of The Christ, and own it on DVD, and I'll probably buy this on DVD too.<br /><br />I have bought the book (for dead cheap), but am saving it for my holidays, for something to do while I'm lying in the sunshine. For those reviewers who say you'll not be able to follow the film if you haven't read the book - rubbish. I went with someone who hasn't read the book also, and we managed to follow it all right I guess. But at 149 minutes long, you don't wanna be drinking during this.<br /><br />I was quite interested in all the little puzzles in this, and how everything was eventually pieced together. It did get my curiosity going, although I did find it slightly predictable, when they mentioned Jesus had a child, but I'm gonna keep it zipped it here.<br /><br />Everyone who has read the book, or seen the film, will know the storyline already, but basically some guy dies, but before he does, he leaves a bunch of clues for the granddaughter he hasn't seen in years (Audrey Tatou), and some Professor, who claims not to know him that well (Tom Hanks.) There's an albino monk, who just appears for no reason, and keeps self flagellating - not a pretty sight, and will take you straight back to viewing Passion Of The Christ. And there are a few others, some ambiguous characters, who help the film stretch out to 149 minutes.<br /><br />In my opinion, you're gonna believe what you wanna believe, but all the hoo-ha about this film, and protestors & such, is just too over the top. But also to me, this film felt like one big lecture about Christianity, and everything linked in to it. Some of the dialogue was so monotone, and very boring, I actually switched off during some of it. (And still managed to follow the film.) Could they not have made it seem a bit more lifelike, it sounded sometimes like the characters were reading straight from the script! C'mon guys, jazz it up a bit, start rapping or something! Now that would be a sight.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, I quite believe the whole Mary Magdalene having Jesus' child, and him having descendants. He was a young guy, do we really wanna believe he died without experiencing stuff like this? Nah. To me, it's all true, but people will believe what they want, but just shove it down our throats alright?<br /><br />This film is going to be one of the biggest films of the year, simply because there is so much hype surrounding it. But don't believe the critics who reviewed it negatively because they felt they had to, see it, and see what you think of it yourself. Don't let anyone influence your opinion.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A world filled with imagination"></head><body><p>Bridge to Terabithia is a film that captures the imagination. But behind the imagination, it is a film about being a kid and developing friendships as well as conflicting experiences that children also have to deal with.  And with most Disney films, there is a moral behind the story that is accentuated with the main character Jess Anderson (Josh Hutcherson).<br /><br />Jess is a boy who lives with three sisters and loves to draw.  Throughout the film he draws in his sketchbook, but his father does no understand him.  His world somewhat lightens up during the first day of class when a new girl shows up, Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb), who also happens to live next door to his house, and helps him to see that he is talented.  And straight to the chase, the two become friends and spend time together sharing anecdotes about each of their lives.  One day they venture out into a wooded area where they create a world of their own; they are free to be anything they want, and the world is indeed their oyster.<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia also confronts childhood dilemmas. Who has not been taunted by a bully, a person who tries to dominate one's world?  Janice (Lauren Clinton), an eighth-grader, is the school bully who refuses entry to all who need to use the girl's room, and the only way to pass is to pay her a dollar.  Jess's sister, May Belle (Bailee Anderson), is constantly bullied by Janice in a very childish manner, taking Bailee's twinkie or refusing her entry to the restroom.  But it is surprising to see how the tables are turned on her, and how she is portrayed in Jess and Leslie's forest of imagination.  In addition, the concluding scenes in the film takes on a serious issue that slightly changes the mood of the film.<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia emphasizes kindness and unselfishness toward others.  And for those who remember playing in a tree-house or playing in the woods and enrapturing one's self in a world of pure imagination, this film will definitely conjure up childhood memories.</p></body></html>

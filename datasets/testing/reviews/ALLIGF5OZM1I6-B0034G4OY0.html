Eastwood directs Damon for the second time, this time as a psychic named George who can communicate with the loved ones you've lost, just by touching you. The reason I say they give us so much out of so little, is because we never see anything other than Damon's flawless acting.<br /><br />George touches your hands and can instantly sense who has passed in your life and can relay their message to you. What makes Hereafter so likeable is that we believe George can do this, from Damon's performance alone. He's not a quack, he doesn't have an ego about his gift and he's just so terribly convincing that even if we didn't know his as Matt Damon, we'd still find him convincing.<br /><br />And saying he doesn't have an ego about it is an understatement by the way. George hates his so called gift and would sooner refer to it as a curse. His talent has left him in a world of bitter and cold isolation and he's fed up with it. We learn that he once made quite a name for himself and a respectable living but has long since given up on all that and taken a mediocre paying job just to get by.<br /><br />The story isn't only about Damon's character George, but it largely is, and it's the one I found the most enjoyable out of the three that are shown to us.<br /><br />We also meet a lovely French woman named Marie, played by Cecile De France, who has had a near death experience and witnessed a small taste of an afterlife. It should be noted that we will be seeing more of this gifted actress in films to come.<br /><br />The third story is of a set of young twins who do anything and everything together and for one another, until a brutal accident changes their lives forever.<br /><br />We cut back and forth between the three stories, realizing that eventually they will come to a head. They do, and it's marvelously done.<br /><br />But let's go back to the George story. Jay Mohr plays George's brother and is so adamant that George should give his talent a second chance in order to help others - that George just might. In the meantime, he has been taking a cooking class at night and has met the woman of his dreams there: Melanie, played by Bryce Dallas Howard - who by the way had better be the next MJ, in the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. She's perfect for it.<br /><br />These two, meaning Damon and Howard, together in a scene, was simply electrifying. They acted and Eastwood directed them, in some of the best romantic scenes that I have ever seen in a film. It was brilliant because they are both experienced adults, but George has been out of the game for so long that it's almost like high school again for him, and for us watching them. They both want each other, but don't seem too keen at first, as to if the feeling is a mutual one.<br /><br />The scene with the blindfold is a pristine blend of eroticism, romance and temptation, and is directed beautifully by Clint Eastwood. In addition to the acting and the directing, I just really liked the idea of two people falling for one another as partners in a nightly cooking class. Because I was so invested in these moments, I was absolutely riveted with anger at what happens between the two of them, that it nearly split me in two; even though I saw it coming from a mile away.<br /><br />But the movie goes on, and it remains good and ends as originally as it opened. It makes us think, it stimulates us and it entertains us. You should know that it is very slow however, and you need to be ready for that when you sit down to watch it. But if you invest the time and the proper amount of attention, you will not be disappointed. And this is important subject matter folks. If you haven't given thought to what your hereafter holds in store for you -perhaps you should.</p></body></html>

Drawing upon a hodgepodge of religious imagery, the movie intersects four time frames, including ancient times and the biblical Tree of Life; the trappings of Medeival Spain when ascetical practices were sometimes severe, and the Inquisition made "heresy" contraband; today, and the future when mankind potentially can reap the benefits of science and meditation.  In the middle times, the conquistador seeks the cure to death with a pilgrimage to Mayan civilization where the pyramid of life can be found and brought back to his queen.  In today's time, that same conquistador is scientist, Tommy (Hugh Jackman), seeking a cure for his terminally ill wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), through an experimental rhesus monkey.  The future looks good if only the past times can be linked together in one healing swoop. A plethora of myths connect the story and time differential. The book 'The Fountain' and an eaten lotus make portals to each place and time.<br /><br />Philosophically, there are no enemies in the movie but death.  In medieval times, Franciscan friar, Fr. Avila, lives in a time where he states, "Bodies are prisons for our souls."  In today's time, Tommy says "Death is a disease, and there's a cure, and I will find it."  Nice stuff.  Who can argue with the idea that death robs us of loved ones, ruins our plans, and creates muddying mystery beyond our imagination?  The movie tries to construct archetypes that pull for our desire to have everlasting life on earth.  Meaningful, the movie is great escapist fare that is cathartic--even if it has to take itself seriously enough to work.<br /><br />`The Fountain' demonstrates effectiveness in ways that Shymalan`s `Lady in the Water` failed to accomplish.  Each scene is shot with easily pleasing panoramic views, and Darren Aronofsky's direction gives the film an essential urgency.  Handled with good, performances by Jackman and Weisz, and an excellent performance by Ellen Burstyn as Tommy's lab supervisor, 'The Fountain' takes the edge off what could have been a disasterous fairy tale gone too fluffy and soft in the head.</p></body></html>

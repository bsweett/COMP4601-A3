<meta name="summary" content="Duvall and Costner were Great"></head><body><p>This is one convincing movie.  It is a tale of two very close friends one Waite (Costner) has been working for Spearman (Duvall).  The movie shows respect for your boss and the kind of trust needed when you are working closely together.<p>Duvall, a tough cowboy, also has a heart for his men and for his past.  Duvall shows his relentlessness to stand up for what is his.  He has no choice, all will be taken away from him, so he stands for his own.  Costner plays a tough cowboy with a past that comes back to help him and even haunt him at times.<p>It is a Western in the sense of the older westerns, beautiful scenery, Alberta, Canada.  The movie has the intensity of The Seekers.  It seems that the old western is back.<p>This movie does get violent and may not be for everyone, yet the gunfight scene is every bit as intense as a Clint Eastwood gunfight, yet it seems much more realistic, like the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Costner plays a much more serious and focused role.  Waite is intense in everything he does.  <p>These are two serious men with a very serious life and a very difficult job to do.  The movie is worth the watch, yet, some who dislike violence in movies may not like the gunfight, yet it is tolerable for the most part.  Open Range is a keeper.</p></body></html>

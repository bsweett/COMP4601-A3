Not a big fan of teen scream films, but I thought Kimberly and the police officer character were entertaining and sympathetic characters. Also the scene at the dental office.... Yikes!<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it a 3. I guess I've outgrown watching films where seeing characters die in various different ways is the primary theme. This film needed more suspense and plot to really entertain me.</p></body></html>

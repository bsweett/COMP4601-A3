The answer, in this case, is yes. The film is a relatively solid Summer action flick, with decent effects and exciting fight scenes.<p>  The Rock stars as Matthias, A.K.A. the titular "Scorpion King". The last of a race of legendary assassins, he stages a one-man assault on the King who killed his brother. That's pretty much it, plotwise. The Rock is no Laurence Olivier, but he gets the job done. <p>  The Rock gets able assistance from the lovely Kelly Hu, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Grant Heslov, the comic relief who steals every scene he's in. The fight between The Rock and Duncan is worth the price of admission alone, and the climactic battle is very well done. <p>  If you go in expecting Citizen Kane, well yeah......you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for an entertaining, mind-numbing way to spend 101 minutes, look no further. I had a good time, and it seemed like everyone else in the theater did, too. A real crowd-pleaser.</p></body></html>

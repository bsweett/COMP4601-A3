The whole wash-up, has-been hero finds a new sense of self and identity with people once perceived as "barbarian" or "savage". The theme has been done before and probably will be again.<br /><br />In "The Last Samurai", Capt. Algren is sent to Japan during the tale end of the Meiji Restoration to train the new Imperial Army in modern warfare. Despite the excellent pay, Algren is an alcoholic with some serious personality issues to boot. The new Imperial Army is soon sent into battle with the other problem: a rebel force of samurai led by Katsumoto, (Ken Watanabe). The results are predictably disastrous and Algren is captured alive. The rest of the plot follows a predictable pattern that most will be familiar with.<br /><br />The character of Katsumoto is actually based, albeit very loosely, on a real person whol live during a similar time and fought in Kyushu. The real man was one Saigo Takamori, who also committed seppuku according to legend. He actually died from bullet wounds sustained during his last stand near Kagoshima. A good book about the man is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471705373">The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori</a>, which is also an excellent read.<br /><br />Tom Cruise puts in an excellent performance, I have to say, as the dysfunctional Algren. Ken Watanabe is amazing in his protrayal of the samurai rebel leader, Katsumoto, bringing an intensity and depth to the movie that can be lacking in other characters.<br /><br />There are some small issues of error, such as ferns and so on in the forests. Being shot in New Zealand, the movie has some scenery from that country that is visibly not Japanese. However, these points are very small and do not take away from the spectacle of the film and its location.<br /><br />The battle scenes are truly amazing, and well shot. There is enough action and some comic relief to keep everyone pretty well entertained. The cultural differences between Algren and his Japanese hosts are a source of some amusement, especially as the younger samurai take a liking to him. This is despite the regular beatings he receives from older samurai he tries to take on.<br /><br />Despite the predictability of the movie, and the lack of originality in some regards, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the style, the action, and the plot, and came away feeling thoroughly entertained and somewhat moved. I just simply liked the movie as overall, well-presented package.</p></body></html>

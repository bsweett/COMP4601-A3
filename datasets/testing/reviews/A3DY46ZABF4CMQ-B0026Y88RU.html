<meta name="summary" content="...this movie earns a Lucky Number four!"></head><body><p>Lucky Number Slevin is a stylish and humorous action thriller featuring a star studded cast including Josh Hartnett (Sin City), Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Oscar winners Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Sir Ben Kingsley (Ghandi), Lucy Liu (Kill Bill), and Stanley Tucci (Road To Perdition). The movie also features cameo appearances by Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Danny Aiello (Do The Right Thing), and Robert Forster (Jackie Brown).<br /><br />The film focuses on a man named Slevin Kelevra, played by Hartnett, who is mistaken as a man named Nick Fisher by a pair of mob rivals, one a black man known as The Boss, played by Freeman, and the other a rabbi known as The Rabbi, played by Kingsley. The Boss's son had just been killed and he is sure that The Rabbi is behind it. So, The Boss assigns Nick, or Slevin, to kill The Rabbi's 'fairy' son to wipe off the debt of $96,000 that Nick owes him. The Rabbi, on the other hand, tells Slevin, or shall I say Nick again, that he owes him $33,000. The man working behind the scenes is a mysterious cold-blooded assassin known as Mr. Goodkat, played by Willis, who's planning a Kansas City Shuffle (you're not supposed to get that until you see the movie), while the private detective Brikowski, played by Tucci, is keeping an eye on that's happening and wondering who the heck Slevin really is.<br /><br />Without giving away the twist of events, the movie and its characters hold many secrets that eventually come to unfold at the end.<br /><br />I enjoyed Lucky Number Slevin a lot. The only flaw I'll point out to is the lack of background study on Bruce Willis's Mr. Goodkat character. Otherwise, this movie earns a Lucky Number four stars, or should I say flour stars?!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What's This?  The Best Christmas  (or something like it) Movie Ever"></head><body><p>Not quite a "one-of-a-kind" movie any more (James and the Giant Peach and Corpse Bride used the same stop-action technology), but still in a class by itself, "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is both my favorite Christmas movie, and my favorite movie from among my daughter's collection (though "Toy Story" is right there to this child of the early '60s).  The brilliant character of Jack Skellington, "The Pumpkin King", and Danny Elfman's amazing score and songs carry the show, but there are plenty of other high(low?)lights among the dozens of ghoulish characters and scenes--the two-faced mayor, the Strangelovian mad scientist, the minor-key string quartet...too many to list.  Catherine O'Hara's poignant voicing of the Jack's cautious admirer, Sally, adds a heartfelt touch to what overall is a pretty strange tale--the hijacking of Christmas and kidnapping of Santa Claus by the denizens of Halloween.  My daughter loved this movie too (though she was just born when it came out), but I think I loved it best then and now.  "Look, Zero--they're thanking us!" Five enthusiastic stars!</p></body></html>

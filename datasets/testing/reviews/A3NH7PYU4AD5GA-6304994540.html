I thought I must have watched it a dozen times. How else can I have told and quoted scenes and dialogues for the last 10 years? Imagine the surprise when details turn out differently from expectations, or rather from imagined recollections.<br />This is surely not the best movie ever made by the Coens, but it is such great fun.<br />What did the Dude say after 5 dips of his head in the toilet bowl, asked where the money was? Let me have another look, it must be in there somewhere. Or something like that.<br />What did he say when the gangster shows him the bowling ball and asks: what is this? No, he does not say: can't you see it is a golf ball. He says what I put in the headline.<br /><br />What made me watch it again today? First of all, watching Bridges as Bad Blake yesterday reminded me that I wanted to revisit Lebowski since some time. Second, I had a discussion in a comment thread around here about the fact that comedies age. Some that I remembered as hilarious from decades ago, like Polanski's vampire joke, or like Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, have on revisit turned out to have become stale. I wanted to check if Lebowski is stale already. Good news: it isn't! But it is a mess of a movie. Never mind, invest two hours of your time and enjoy it!</p></body></html>

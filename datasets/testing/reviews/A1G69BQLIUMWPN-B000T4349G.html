<meta name="summary" content="I give this movie some credit..."></head><body><p>I would claim this to be one of my favorite movies if they didn't ruin it in the end with the people stealing kids being aliens!  I mean the whole consept of the FBI stealing kids was a great story line (totally scary because it would be believable), but like any truly great movie it had to be ruined by aliens.  Which for me didn't work in this movie.  I just was disappointed that the acting and story line of missing kids would be overpowered by aliens and their plot.  Those of you who enjoy alien stories may enjoy this those of you who didn't know it had aliens unti I said it may want to wait until it comes out on video.  It may be something you like or it may disappoint you as it did me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Math problem is the prison - is the proof the way out?"></head><body><p>Gwyneth Paltrow is Catherine, a young mathematician who is the daughter of Robert, a legendary mathematician ruined by mental illness and played by Anthony Hopkins.  The lives of mathematicians revolve around their ability to craft coherent answers, or proofs for elaborate mathematical questions.  Few mathematicians successfully and single-handedly arrive at a significant proof in their careers and, as "Proof" suggests, most mathematicians hit their peak in their mid-twenties.  Robert managed the first hurdle, but as to the second - his life degenerated into an existence trapped in a house of math books and notebooks riddled with incomprehensible figures.  Catherine, having dropped out of school to care for her father, already wonders if she's destined to suffer the same life of mental illness as her father.  She "loses" time, and endures spates of depression that keep her bedridden for days.  However, when she's up and about, her sometimes lucid father engages her in number games, and urges her to work on proofs while out of school - he himself suddenly feels competent enough to work out a new proof, one which will compensate for years wasted looking for alien messages in Dewey-Decimal codes at the local library.  Mathematics is both home and prison for all mathematicians - it's absorbing, and those steeped in its ways find themselves undone trying to rely on it to explore and explain their reality.  And when a possibly groundbreaking proof is found in one of Robert's many notebooks the script turns into a battle of wills between Catherine who claims to have written it, and Claire who thinks that Catherine is using the proof to hold onto a bleak existence in Chicago where she will follow her father's path into madness.<br /><br />Robert is already dead when "Proof" starts, and we only meet him in flashbacks that hint at both his and his daughter's sanity.  In the "present", in the aftermath of Robert's death, Catherine must deal with Harold "Hal" Dobbs (Gylenhaal), a young mathematician who may represent Robert's opposite - sane but also mediocre.  Hal loves her, or maybe he's in love with being the boyfriend of the daughter of a legendary mathematician, and he's obsessed with finding the shreds of a master-proof buried in hundreds of notebook pages of scribbles.  Then there's Claire (Hope Davis), Catherine's older sister, an established financial analyst in Manhattan (the story is set in Chicago).  One of the best scenes in the flick (and easily the funniest in what's not quite a laugh-riot movie) is the first meeting of Hal & Claire.  Already beginning to suspect that Catherine is well on the road to emotional instability, Claire drills Catherine on details about Hal - always referring to him by his full name, as if he were a delusion of Catherine and needed first and last name to ground him in reality.  In the next scene - driving up to Catherine's and finding Hal already there, Claire points at him with angry vindication - "Harold - Briggs!!".  (The script slyly suggests that Claire may be at least as insane as her father, but found in her job and home an existence that accommodates her mental state.)  When the disputed "proof" is first found, Harold becomes the battleground between Claire and Catherine - the older sister convinced that their father found lucidity before his death to author a last heuristic hurrah.<br /><br />This was a great film, though largely on its performances - the story itself seems unfinished, with a too-pat ending.  I never thought much of Gylenhaal, though he's incredibly mature if befuddled by Catherine (if you didn't like "The Good Girl" because of him, he's still great here).  The deft script makes him a cutting composite of a man who genuinely feels for Catherine while also being exactly what Catherine hates about mathematicians - geeks who hit their peak early and spend the rest of their lives bragging about conferences they attend, playing in horrible rock bands, poking holes in the proofs of others and paving the way for the next generation of mathematicians.  Hope Davis makes the most out of Catherine's extremely unlikable sister, in a script that has little patience for her.  The movie of course belongs to Paltrow who seems to be both fighting a losing battle for sanity and fighting off those who might try to rescue her from it - it's her least "Hollywood" performance, prickly and unfriendly yet oddly beguiling.  Catherine has already learned that math is a prison, but spends the rest of the story trying to find something other than the disputed proof to save her from that cell.</p></body></html>

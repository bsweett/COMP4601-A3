But, for me, it was simply impossible to look beyond the rather awful sub-plot with the 'doctor' and the 'blonde'. Not to mention the supporting cast which was totally overshadowed by the leads. I loved the unusual soundtrack and of course the camera work was surreal. Still there was just enough wrong with this to lop off the fifth star. Jim Carey truly is a good actor and I am relieved to see him take chances like this. He seemed to play this role a bit close to the vest but he was still a marvel to watch. I highly reccommend this to those who love to think, I think you'll love it. My final critique is, I wish the story could have been told via using a different vehicle, thus removing the sub-plot characters; comas, longing, anything would have been better than the process used in the film.</p></body></html>

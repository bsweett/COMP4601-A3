<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith is Great"></head><body><p>If even something is great in this movie it's a character's (Will Smith's own?) muscular body.<br /><br />A completely illogical film of a scientist having survived the virus transforming people into flash-eating zombies has climaxed into him becoming a world saviour by donating his own healing blood upon being consumed by these mutants.<br /><br />I prefer New York City in its glory rather than mutilated post-apocalypse rubbish-side of dementia-suffering nightmares.</p></body></html>

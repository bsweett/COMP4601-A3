<meta name="summary" content="Twister Will Sweep You Off Your Feet!"></head><body><p>This is clearly one of the best disaster films ever made.  The acting is believable all around and who can't enjoy Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton in anything they are in.  The storyline borrows heavily from Cameron's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IL">The Abyss</a> with a couple who supposedly hate each other and are one step, literally, from signing divorce papers (Paxton's character even has his future wife with him to complete this task and that is hysterical) to discover that they still love each other.  The "future wife", nicely played by Jami Gertz, sees this and respectfully and politely steps aside later.<br /><br />The plot has two antagonists in that one is obviously the various twisters, the monster F5 one is awesome, and the other is Jonas, played very well by the nearly unrecognizable Carey Elwes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LOKQ">The Princess Bride</a> fame who is competing with Bill and Helen's crew to launch a device into a twister to learn more about them.  Interesting note here is that when Bill and Helen feel they won't be successful at it offer their help in the name of science to Jonas (who indignantly declines it).<br /><br />Along with a cast of very familiar faces is Phillip Seymor Hoffman, Oscar-winner for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E33VWW">Capote</a>, as the lovable, albeit also annoying, Dusty.  Who can forget his "suck zone" and "at least she can fly" jokes in the film.  He is the consistent comic relief in this edge-of-your-seat film and there are numerous one-liners by others in the film that lighten up the tension.<br /><br />The direction is confidently handled by veteran action director Jan DeBont (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GANOQ">Speed</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783237413">The Haunting</a>) and, of course, the special effects are top-notch.  I thought this film was great fun and that's all it was meant to be.  This isn't supposed to be Shakespeare for crying out loud.</p></body></html>

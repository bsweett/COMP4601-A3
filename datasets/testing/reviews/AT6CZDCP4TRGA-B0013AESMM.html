<meta name="summary" content="Vigilante justice with a HUMAN face..."></head><body><p>...flawlessly played by Jodie Foster as a dynamic Everywoman whom circumstances push into taking the law into her own hands, opposite Terrence Howard in an equally strong performance as the sensitive "good cop" who is intrigued by her, investigates her, and then...well, I'll refrain from any spoilers here, but it's not quite as formulaic as it sounds.<br /><br />What makes this film interesting from the typical dime-a-dozen revenge/vigilante movies is that the protagonist is not cast in some vainglorious heroic light, but instead is portrayed as a 3-dimensional fully fleshed out, entirely human character.<br /><br />The actual violent scenes are ok, nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.<br /><br />Am not sure I'd want to own this movie, but it was worth seeing once.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A deadly Addiction..."></head><body><p>The 2007 movie thriller "Mr. Brooks" features a strong cast, an interesting premise, and some truly creepy momemnts.  Keven Costner leads as Mr. Earl Brooks, a mild-mannered box manufacturer and philanthropist with a secret "addiction" to serial murder.  His addiction manifests itself in part as an alternate personality, Marshall (well-played by William Hurt), with whom he conducts internal debates over his killing.<br /><br />After a two-year lull, Mr. Brooks indulges his need to kill, but gets careless.  A peeping tom photographer named Smith (Dane Cook) blackmails Brooks for a piece of the action.  To complicate matters, Mr. Brooks' daughter unexpectedly comes home from college, pregnant and trailed by a murder investigation.  Mr. Brooks himself is under suspicion from a Detective Atwater (Demi Moore), a good cop with a tangled personal life.  Mr. Brooks will attempt to resolve the conflicts in his life in the way he knows best, playing a cat-and-mouse game with Atwater and Smith.<br /><br />Costner is superbly convincing in the role, playing loving husband, father and serial killer in a way that likely earns sympathy from a reluctant audience.  His meticulous execution of his crimes has a chilling fascination of its own, while his final confrontations with Smith and Atwater are priceless set-pieces.  William Hurt is equally convincing as Brooks' alter ego.  Since we know from the beginning who the murderer is, the suspense is in whether he will be caught, and how.  A trick double-ending adds to the suspense.  The story might have been streamlined by eliminating at least one of the sub-plots.  "Mr. Brooks" is highly recommended as something different in a murder mystery.</p></body></html>

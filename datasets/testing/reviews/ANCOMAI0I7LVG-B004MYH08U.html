I kind of love Superhero films only because I grew up loving Superheroes and so to see my favorite characters on the big screen is a big deal for me.  Sadly, sometimes those films get weighed down by attempts to do too much or live up to such high expectations that they either shrivel up into wasted efforts or they are relegated to the closet as `satisfying fluff with no real memorable facet'.  There are some exceptions (`The Dark Knight', X2: United', `Spider-Man 2'; all of which set a bar VERY high) but they aren't the norm, especially when you consider the fact that Superhero movies are made by the handful every year.<br /><br />Anyways, back to my initial thought.  I remember thinking that the idea of Seth Rogan playing the lead was an inspired move because he is SO not your typical Superhero, and I was getting tired of seeing Ryan `twelve-pack' Reynolds getting every Superhero gig out there.  Then you factor in Michael Gondry, who is awesome, Christolph Waltz, James Franco, Cameron Diaz and Tom Wilkinson, who I practically worship, and you have my appetite whet for sure.<br /><br />Then the reviews poured in, the critics panned it and everyone I knew said it was awful.<br /><br />I just, finally, had a chance to see this the other night and I'm baffled that this was disregarded as Superhero trash.  In fact, outside of the poorly conceived Kung-Fu scenes (I think people get so carried away with the 3D idea that they forget it still has to play out on a 2D screen) and the somewhat cluttered ending, this film was GREAT.<br /><br />For me, this film soars because of two things.  First you have Seth Rogan.  I seriously think this guy is awesome.  Sure, he has his detractors, but I love his everyman humor and the way that he understands layering his `shmuck' characters with enough heart and warmth to make them truly likable (and in a believable way at that).  Here he plays a dejected son of an egomaniac who grows up without a mother and winds up squandering his potential by boozing it up with loose women in an attempt to get back at the father who never loved him.  Then his father dies and he has to take over the newspaper company he ran.  He is initially uninterested, but when he gets the chance to play `Superhero' (quite by accident) he sees that he can use his father's business to make his wildest dreams come true.  By becoming a Superhero (who poses as a villain to gain the upper hand on the real bad guys) he uncovers the truth behind his father's death and the truth behind the man he always regarded as a terrible human being.<br /><br />I didn't mean to say all that without getting to the second reason this works, but then again, I don't think I'm done talking about Seth Rogan.  Seriously, he makes this movie work.  His humor is laced on every scene (he co-wrote the script) and it becomes a part of the fabric of the film.  The dialog is beyond quotable and infectiously entertaining, and that really keeps us glued.  It reminded me of the dialog for `Super 8' in that it was so sharp and witty that it, at most times, overrode the films construction issues.<br /><br />The second reason this works is Michael Gondry.  His stylistic approach to filmmaking is used expertly here, but not in a way I initially expected.  Instead of fantasizing in a way that most would approach a Superhero film, Gondry scales back his visual inventiveness for a film that thrives on revisiting the nostalgic atmosphere of the pulp, crime noirs of yesteryear.  No, this is not a noir (by any means) but it has such visual presence and references that era nicely.  From the sets to the costumes to the score, this really embodied a strange sense of class that I wasn't expecting.  It was modern, sure, but it felt very old-fashioned and I think that was a good thing in an era so obsessed with outdoing the last `action film'.<br /><br />Yes, I hated the way those slow motion action scenes were shot.  The scene where Britt and Kato have a fight in the house is far more entertaining because it is stripped of that gawky slow motion idea.  The use of 3D is too obvious to the 2D viewer (the bottle cap moment was ridiculous) and so it takes away from the actual film to a degree.  And yes, the conclusion was a tad cluttered (so much at one time) but it worked out in the end.<br /><br />When all is said and done, I thoroughly enjoyed this.  For me, this was a nice diversion from the over-produced Superhero films clamoring for that `Special Effects' Oscar.</p></body></html>

He is the driving force that takes this movie to a whole new level. If you've been looking for something new in your science fiction than this is it. Much like its little brother, Pitch Black, its a typical science fiction plot, a race of intergalactic people run around the universe taking over planets. Riddick has been brought into this mess against his will. In keeping with his character, he is always driven by one thing: looking out for # 1. This is the first chapter to a possible series of films about this really fun, butt kicking character.<p>The special effects are pretty standard. Although there is an annoying fuzziness to it all that isn't always pleasing to the eyes. The supporting cast is decent enough to back up the awesome screen presence of Vin Diesel who carries this picture from one thrilling scene to the next. His  dead pan expression brings back those 80's one man armies with glistening pecs and cool one liners. It plays out as a very introductory plot leaving much to be explained later. It doesn't over burden itself with a huge epic story all in one film, instead it keeps things small as we watch Riddick on his the adventures that lead him to the necromonger king. <p>The films end is truly inspired. If you love this character you will have a big grin on your face at the possibilites the next two films may have in store. It does have its flaws though, the action scenes are edited in a very chopper manner, and the absence of sound in one big fight scene is obvious and makes the scene feel empty. This was surely done to secure the PG-13 rating. We can probably expect an uncut directors edition on DVD.<p>Granted if you don't already love Riddick from Pitch Black alot of this film may be too hard to swallow, but if you lose yourself on this ride you will come out truly satisfied.</p></body></html>

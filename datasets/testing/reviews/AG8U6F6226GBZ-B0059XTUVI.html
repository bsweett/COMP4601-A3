I heard it was so good, and Meryl Streep always is, but not in this kind of film.  I watched for the first 20 minutes, maybe less, and came to the computer to read the reviews.  Was it me?  At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, but after a short while I realized they were doing re-runs of her life through a woman aging with dementia.  My mother suffered from Alzheimer's and I didn't want to watch it all over again.  It's a horror.  I will not watch the rest of this film. After reading the reviews, I realized that many other reviews were not good, and though it's Meryl Streep, and she's a great actress, it didn't help. I've recently purchased two DVD's with her in it,Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada, I loved them both. Watched them many times.  She's great in both. The films are uplifting and enjoyable.  We all have enough of our own problems to watch something as awful as this. I hated Doubt as well, but at least I could watch it.  I guess I'm not interested in horror films.  That was what this film seemed to be moving into. Well, that's all I have to write.  I will probably never watch the rest, but I don't think I'll be missing anything.  Why didn't they make a film about the high points of her life and career? That's what I thought it would be.  Who knows?  Good advice.  Read these reviews before you purchase any films.</p></body></html>

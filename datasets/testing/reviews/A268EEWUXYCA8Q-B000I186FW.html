That cue right there let me know this wasn't going to be the average action film.  Of course, with all of the hoopla and news about this movie and its controversy, I never once truly thought it would be the average action film.<br /><br />In fact, to call it an action film is misleading.  It has more in line with political thrillers than other action films.  There are a couple central mysteries that the plot wraps itself around.  Each of these mysteries are investigated through various means including Stephen Rea as a detective brave enough to follow the trails.  Speaking of the cast, it is quite formidable.  V is, of course, played by Hugo Weaving who not many know off hand but will remember him as either Agent Smith or Elrond the elf.  Natalie Portman plays Evey.  In a terrific and ironic twist, London's dictator is played by John Hurt who starred in 1984, a film V for Vendetta has a lot in common with.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is about London in 2020, a time not very far removed from us, but utterly alien.  The United States has fallen from the power-country and Britain has reigned its head in a dictatorship way.  Sutler, the dictator in question, uses footage from around the world (some true some not) in order to subdue his citizens.  Citizens are told of the horrors in far off lands, the attrocities being committed.  And then is told that this "uber-protection" he utilizes is for his citizens best.  "See?  We don't have these problems here in London."  True.  But the problems there are, arguably, worse.<br /><br />V also owes a debt of gratitude to Guy Fawkes, the anti-hero who, in 1605, tried to blow up Parliament because of their laws that didn't given Catholics the same rights as the Angelicans.  In other words, the freedom to act and live as they deserved.  In 2020, 400 years after this event, the day has been all but forgotten and the citizens live in blissful ignorance that they have given up all their rights.<br /><br />What the film makers have done, though, is give us an interesting protagonist in V.  Is he mad?  Is he genius?  Is he right?  Wrong?  None of these questions are directly and the film makers leave the audience with more questions than answers as to what to think of this film.  People are drawing connections to current day situations.  I don't think this is unfounded, but instead of using the film to make a critique of our current culture, I believe they are doing something more interesting.  The London in this movie got to the way they were due to apathy and fear and allowing their government to usurp any rights and freedoms they have.  As free citizens, this movie instead evokes us and pleads with us to not let us get to that situation.  A situation in which it takes a 'terrorist' to knock some sense into the government and its people.<br /><br />A must see.</p></body></html>

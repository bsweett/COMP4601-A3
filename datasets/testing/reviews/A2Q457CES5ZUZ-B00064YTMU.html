<meta name="summary" content="Cruise, Foxx in Death Duel"></head><body><p>Jamie Foxx is in a mellow mood when Tom Cruise enters his taxicab at Los Angeles International Airport.  He has just performed a kind deed by providing an attractive young lawyer who has expressed frustration and doubt over the success of the federal case she is in Los Angeles to prosecute a free ride, for which she was grateful and provided him with her card.<br /><br />It turns out that this federal prosecutor, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, will be linked to Cruise, but this is something Foxx finds out later.  Initially Cruise behaves in the manner of the successful executive type he appears to be, articulate, well dressed and bemoaning the fact that Los Angeles is so spread out with people failing to connect.  He makes a comment that one can die in a Metropolitan Transit Authority vehicle without the death being discovered for hours.<br /><br />The death comment contains a connection to what Cruise's profession turns out to be, to the shock of easy going Foxx.  Cruise takes him on an all-night mission as he seeks to eliminate witnesses in a federal drug case in which a leading syndicate being operated by a Los Angeles racketeer stands to be shut down and its principals sent to prison.<br /><br />Foxx attempts to shake loose of Cruise, but to no avail.  Cruise is so cold-blooded that he politely engages in a conversation about jazz and an appearance by the great Miles Davis with the operator of a club in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, who also plays the trumpet in the band.  After Cruise, Fox and the proprietor finish a relaxing drink the sociopathic hit man kills his cringing victim.<br /><br />At one point, so suspicion will not be drawn toward Cruise, the hit man buys flowers for Foxx's sick mother and visits the hospital with him, where he is expected that evening.  Cruise makes a positive impression on Fox's mother through his engaging conversational manner.<br /><br />It is Foxx who undergoes the character change during the nerve-wracking evening.  The formerly easygoing taxi driver toughens up significantly under the strain of the moment.  He has a strong hunch that he is intended to be Cruise's last victim.  This is borne out by police records, which reveal a recent incident in which an Oakland cab driver committed alleged "suicide" under strange circumstances while some unsolved killings were being committed in the same areas he had traversed before his demise.<br /><br />Foxx ultimately concludes that Jada Pinkett Smith is prosecuting the case in which Cruise is seeking to eliminate all federal witnesses, and that the prosecutor is the final target on the narcotics syndicate's hit list.  The story spins into high gear, along with Foxx's strategy mode, as he seeks to save her from what will otherwise be a swift and ruthless death performed by a killing automaton with no apparent conscience.<br /><br />Michael Mann directed the film from a screenplay written by Stuart Beattie.  The crafty cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron accent the rapidly paced action with bull's-eye close-ups of people battling for survival in Los Angeles as a vicious drug mob does battle with federal and local authorities.</p></body></html>

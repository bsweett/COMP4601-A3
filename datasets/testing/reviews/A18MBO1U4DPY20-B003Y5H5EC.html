The screenplay and the powerful acting captures you in such a way. I loved the start of the movie and the underlying suspense, You will never know what happens next.  It is not as good as Saw but definitely worthwhile a watch if you bothered with the sequels. Another film people might really like would be "Five Fingers" Hard Candy makes you fall in love with the villain but is there one in the movie, I ask. The end was questionable and abrupt but then, you don't set terms for a film of this magnitude. Hard Candy is the kind of film I will recommend to all my friends knowing a lot of them won't like it. ***k that. Watch it!</p></body></html>

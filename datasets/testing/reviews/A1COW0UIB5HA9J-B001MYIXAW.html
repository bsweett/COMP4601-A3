<meta name="summary" content="Excellent vampire romance movie!"></head><body><p>In the year 1982 in a Swedish town, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a lonely bullied 12 year old boy who wants anything for revenge on the local punk kids that harrass him. A young 12 year old girl named Eli (Lina Leanderson) and so called father Haken (Per Ragner) move in next door, it seems he has found an answer to his sollutions. His parents Erik and Vyonne (Henrik Dahl and Karin Bergquist) are having some problems but Oskar seems to be the one with the most problems with some other kids picking on him at school and in town, however murders have been occuring over the last days since Eli and Haken moved next year. Later Eli reveals herself to be some sort of vampire that feeds off the blood at night and has remained 12 for 200 years as Oskar doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />A brilliant work of art! this Swedish import is a gory and romantic horror drama vampire movie that is based on a popular Swedish novel. This is one of those rare vampire movies without the use of fangs or some of the Dracula mentality yet they can still be burnt by the sun and there is gore around here. The love story works here because they are 2 preteens who have little in common yet they find their love to be a little forbidden yet almost in a sexual way, there is even a hint that Eli may or may not be a girl which is subtle but this is one of the most original yet unique works of cinematic art in recent memory. Came out in the year of the vampire 2008 where stuff like Vampire Diaries, Twilight and True Blood came out, this one just picked a right time to come out and is one of the must see movies ever.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives viewers the authentic theatrical feel even with it's sweet surround sound in Swedish with english subtitles and even a very nice English dub track. The extras are few such as deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, and photo & Theatrical poster galleries. A must have for vampire and horror movie fans, but i can't believe an American made remake comes out this year but on the other hand it's produced by Hammmer, so that shouldn't be too bad.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Fright Night 1 & 2", "The Lost Boys", "Interview with the Vampire", "Vamp", "The Hunger", "Martin", "Dracula (Any version including 1931, 1979, Bram Stoker's and Hammer)", "Nosferatu (1922 and 1979 versions)", "Twilight Saga", "Lifeforce", "Def By Tempation", "Count Yorga", "Thirst (Korean 2008)", "The Vampire Lovers", "Vampire's Kiss", "Salem's Lot (1979 and 2004)", "Nosferatu (1922 and 1979)", "Habit", "Immortality (a.k.a.

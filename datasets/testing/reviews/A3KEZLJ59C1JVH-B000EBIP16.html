<meta name="summary" content="Great adaptation of a classic story"></head><body><p>I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie! "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" is everything I hoped it would be. As a huge fan of the C.S. Lewis novel, I didn't expect the film adaptation to live up to the book, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie nailed everything perfectly.<br /><br />This film tells the story of Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. The four siblings are sent away to the home of a quirky professor during World War II. The professor's house is huge and the children spend a lot of time exploring. One day the youngest child, Lucy, stumbles across a peculiar wardrobe. Behind the mothballs and fur coats is an entrance to the magical world of Narnia, which is under the control of the evil White Witch. Lucy and her siblings encounter many colorful characters in Narnia and join with them to defeat the witch and bring freedom to the residents of Narnia.<br /><br />Obviously, since this is a film adaptation of a novel, a few things from the book had to be cut. The original novel is so fabulous and it's a shame that every word couldn't have been included in the movie, but that would have been virtually impossible to do. Overall, I thought the screenplay was wonderful and the film stayed very true to the book. Everything that was depicted on screen looked exactly the way I imagined it would when I read the novel. The cast is perfect...all four children are so cute! (I must admit, I was not thrilled with Georgie Henley [the actress who played Lucy] at first, but she grew on me pretty quickly...and Tilda Swinton was PERFECT as the White Witch...so creepy!) The special effects were also incredible. All of the Narnia creatures looked amazing, especially Aslan (and whoever decided to get Liam Neeson to do Aslan's voice deserves a gold star for the day).<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED this movie! Watching it brought back many fond memories of reading "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" as a child...I'm so glad that the book is being reintroduced to a new generation of children in such a wonderful way. I hope more of the Narnia books make their way to the big screen very soon!</p></body></html>

Had it not been for Kiera Knightly, James McAvoy, and Vanessa Redgrave's combined thespian talents ... this movie wouls have been a watery rendition of the story.<br /><br />Set in England in 1935, an imaginative and romantically jealous 13-year-old girl makes an accusation that ends up destroying three lives. Briony Tallis, a budding writer, secretly fancies Robbie Turner, the son of the family hosuekeeper. Just back from Cambridge, Robbie and Briony's older sister Cecilia, are fighting their internal feelings for one another on the hottest day of the year. A misplaced letter finds itself in the hands of Briony which triggers the fateful accusation that lands Robbie in jail and Cecilia estranged from her family.<br /><br />Five years later, the teenage Briony is a nurse in training in London during the second world war and tries to makes ammends to her sister. Robbie is fighting in the British army and stranded in France while Ceclia lives in a modest flat in Belham living off her hospital wages. Briony uses her literary ability to attone for her inner shame and guilt over what she did. However, there is nothing that can be done to restore Robbie or Cecilia's shattered lives.<br /><br />Through a series of flashbacks and other scenes we learn that Briony has relied on her imagination to heal the rift between her sister and Robbie. The very same imagination that caused her to rip them apart in the first place. In the end, there is no true attonement for any of them. Lynn Redgrave as the old Briony brings the story to its sad ending of unfinished business and love lost by one lie.</p></body></html>

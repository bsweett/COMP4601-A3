<meta name="summary" content="The Chronicles of Riddick- A Fun Sci-Fi Action Flick"></head><body><p>David Twohy's The Chronicles of Riddick is an enjoayble sequel.  I never actually realized how much of a highly anticipated movie this was, considering the new Director's Cut of Pitch Black was released and an animated series of films called Dark Fury.  Vin Diesel is back as Richard B. Riddick in this action-packed, special effects extravaganza.  I tried to make some sort of plot but I just couldn't find one.  The story while completely incoherrent is luckily saved with some dazzling<br />special effects and hot action.  The planet Helion Prime is invaded by the Necromongers led by Lord Marshall (played nicely by Colm Feore).  The Necromongers are a deadly force, destroying all life in their path.  Riddick must stop them.  I must say that this is one of the most entertaining sci-fi flicks<br />I've seen since the Matrix trilogy.  The rest of the cast includes Thandie Newton, Dame Judi Dench (guess she needed money), Alexa Davolos, Karl Urban and others.  The sets are astonishing and the budget (I'm not sure of what it is) really does show.<br />  The Chronicles of Riddick has been getting mostly negative reviews but it's a fun movie, one which obviously shouldn't be taken too seroiusly.  I must say I had some doubts when I leared that this film was rated PG-13, considering Pitch Black was "R" and had some gore, though the fights were a lot more intense and there were more of them. The film is rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Violent Action and Some Language.  The action in this movie does bring to mind the movie "The Matrix," but the action is still cool and intense.  There are quite a few fight sequences (more action than in the first movie)  with impaling but the fights remain bloodless and nongraphic.  There is some occasional profanity, not too strong as well as mild sexual innuendo.  Overall, a fun enjoyable sci-fi sequel which I<br />fun in watching, worth seeing in theatres, but if you chose not too, definitely check out at Blockbuster.  See Pitch Black if you haven't yet.</p></body></html>

Despite some MAJOR glaring continuity error's from the original alien films and also the subsequent predator movies, I personally felt that for all of these problems, I still enjoyed the film.<br /><br />Were there problems combining these two franchises together?  ABSOLUTELY.  There was much that was removed from the original script which went on to explain several of these errors, such as the incredible speed with which the aliens would be implanted, burst and grow to full size in...this being just one example of what apparently WAS in the script, but due to pressure from the film company, was edited out in order to achieve a more viewer-friendly PG13 rating.  While I see the reason for doing this, I also feel it, deep down, screwed up the enjoyment of the film overall.<br /><br />I also noticed one problem from the original Predator films that seemed to be totally absent from AVP: from what I can gather, the sweltering heat of the jungle featured in the first movie and the major heat-wave they were experiencing in Pred-2 gave me the distinct impression that hot, humid weather had to do with the where and when the Predator's did their hunting.  Now we see them in about the most opposite weather scenario you can have on planet earth in AVP.  Continuity error?  Yup.  I also found the coming to hunt every 100 years or so to be another HUGE error from the original films vs. AVP.  When you get right down to it, there were SO MANY I am virtually amazed I actually enjoyed the movie at ALL -- but I did.  I still had a fun time watching two of the greatest bad guys Hollywood has ever put on film going at it toe-to-toe.  The special effects were, by and large, rather impressive.  While many (and I do mean many) problems exist between the original films of both the franchises and this version, I have to say I enjoyed it better than the last two Alien films combined, especially Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />Will there be an AVP2?  Most likely.  What I am waiting for however, is the Directors Cut of AVP which will no doubt explain much of the problems that pretty much everyone who has seen the films have noticed and had problems with...but there are so many of them I seriously doubt that even HALF can be taken care of sufficiently.  Still, if AVP2 hits the big screens and is PG13 will I see it?  I'd have to say YES.  My son is just now discovering Aliens and Predators and he thought the film was just about the greatest movie EVER (but you have to realize he thinks the sequel to Dumb & Dumber was better than the original...).  As a friend of mine pointed out when we were watching Terminator 2 and I was busy commenting on some of the films un-real scenes, 'Just enjoy the movie as is.  It isn't supposed to be rocket science.'  And he was right.  Sure, Hollywood is more concerned with the bottom line rather than actually making good cinema any longer, but I still enjoy a fun alien movie with great special effects.  Here's to hoping the next AVP movie will be able to close the gaps created by this movie.  All in all, it could have been a lot better, but it was still pretty fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wish I couldn't see this movie through the fog...."></head><body><p>When a small town decides to make and present a statue dedicated to people that helped establish their town, its usually a joyous occasion. However for Antonio Island off the Oregon coast, the people are about to pay tribute to four men which will lead to events that will bring terror to the entire island. A couple of people (who are descendants of two of those four men) seem to be troubled by a mysterious fog that has begun to roll in and engulf the town, oh and there's some murders that occur that may or may not have something to do with this fog.<br /><br />Later in the film its found out that back in 1871, the four guys in the statue betrayed some guy named Blake who had purchased part of the island to help some lepers, but of course it doesn't just end there, oh no sir. This fog and the murders are the result of Blake and his lepers who were killed years back and now they want revenge on anyone on the island and especially those related to the four guys.<br /><br />This is a remake of a 1980 film starring Jamie Lee Curtis, which was far, far better than this film could ever have hoped to be. This version stars Tom Welling (TV's "Smallville"), Maggie Grace ("Taken") and Selma Blair ("Hellboy") who are all very mis-cast here, there's not one moment of suspense, terror or anything redeeming. The conclusion is laughable and really I was just thankful it ended when it did. * out of 4 stars.</p></body></html>

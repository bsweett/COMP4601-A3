<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect Bad-Day at Work Movie"></head><body><p>Now first off I should warn people that this is not a movie for all tastes. If the following offends you:<p>- Graphic, ultrarealistic violence.<br />- Porn films<br />- The idea of taking your date to a porn film.<br />- 12 year old hookers.<br />- Graphic language involving sex with a 12 year old.<br />- Graphic language in general.<br />- Racial slurs<p>...then don't watch this film. <p>OK, now that I sound like I'm giving the movie a bad rap, let me continue with the good stuff: this film is the only movie where you root for the depressed psycho stalker. It sounds incredible, but its true. Robert DeNiro's character Travis Bickle is described in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Colossal Guide as "an ordinary guy with a few problems." Few problems includes not being able to sleep, having a steady job as a taxi driver only because he has too, and dealing with his hatred for the world around him.<p>He attempts to change things by turning to a young woman working on a presidential campaign. What starts out great turns rotten after Travis tries to make her watch a porn film. Stalking her doesn't work, so he gives up and decides to take his rage on the corrupt New York of the time on some one else. That being the hoodlums toying with Jodie Foster, a 12 year old prostitute. He sets out to save her from life on the street - a one man war on prostituting minors.<p>Like I said, its the only movie where you cheer for the psycho.<p>Any way, you might wonder why I rank this "the perfect bad-day at work movie." Thats because it really is. Travis has to deal with customers having sex in the taxi or making him park the vehicle outside a house where they explain on killing some one. Travis doesn't like it, but its the only job he can have at the moment so he has to put up with the horrible conditions. Finally, he breaks free of his torment and gets back at in any way possible.<p>One night I came back after working an exhaustive 9 hour shift as a clerk for a grocery store. I had had a HORRIBLE day, so when I got home I popped this movie in my DVD player. I tell you, you never see Travis so much a hero as when you've had a horrible day at work and know just how he feels. Even if you feel disgusted by some of his actions, in reality we all have a bit of Travis in us all, and there are times when we all just wanna break out in, "Listen all you f***heads, you screw ups, this is the story of a man who would not take it any more..."</p></body></html>

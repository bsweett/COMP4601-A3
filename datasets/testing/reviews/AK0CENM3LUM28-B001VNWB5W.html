I enjoy the movie, despite the fact that the over-the-top violence would normally put me entirely off, because I think there's a great deal of entertainment to be had in the world presented: a world that seems to be entirely populated by good guys, bad guys, and gun-toting hookers. Since the alternate reality they inhabit is so foreign to our own (right down to the black-and-white color schema!), the deep philosophical rumblings on the nature of life that are directed at the audience can be enjoyed either as the insane ramblings of strong men who have enjoyed one too many hits to the noggin, or as a realistic portrayal of a world alien to our own. But, and this is the key: you never get the feeling that you're supposed to take it *seriously*, simply because the world is so alien to our own that any direct comparison fails from the get-go.<br /><br />What is disturbing about "Watchmen" is that, even though the movie is clearly set in a reality alternate from our own, the movie seems to keep asking us to condone the actions and beliefs of the masked vigilantes on the screen. Like "Sin City", it is difficult to find a character here who isn't insane, a murderer, or offensively callous and self-indulgent (or all three), and yet unlike "Sin City", the movie seems not to be saying "Wow, look how messed up these guys are" and more, "Wow, don't these guys have a tough-yet-realistic view of humanity," and it's difficult for me to get on board with an author tract like that. Indeed, because these characters are framed within the "masked vigilante heroes" narrative, it's sometimes difficult to tell if the movie remembers that many of them *are* murderers who regularly (and illegally) take the law into their own hands.<br /><br />Even if you can get past the uncomfortable feeling that the movie is preaching at you, I just found it difficult to enjoy "Watchmen" on its own merits. Perhaps because it is in color, but the violence feels more real and more gratuitous than I'm usually comfortable with - close up shots of womens hands being blown off might be 'artsy', but not necessarily entertaining. The lack of a strong female presence was also off-putting - in a movie puportedly featuring "strong" super-women, it's very vexing to realize that the three women in the movie have defining roles as victim (our lesbian masked avenger and, for my money, the most interesting character in the movie, which is why it's a shame she gets killed in the bloody credits), victim (in a brutal near-rape scene which does little to establish Silk Spectre as a hero who can handle herself on the streets), and ing&eacute;nue (I'm not sure how else to define Silk Spectre Mark Two, whose defining role in the movie is largely a matter of "who is she sleeping with right now?"). It seems like a strange step backward from "Sin City" where the hookers and strippers were more tough-as-nails and paradoxically less defined by their sexuality than these supposedly empowered characters.<br /><br />Too much of the plot comes down to an authorial "because I say so". Why is Nixon willing to touch off nukes (despite the truly horrible 50-50 odds of surviving the conflict) the moment Dr. Manhattan disappears, rather than attempt "weak" diplomacy? Why does the final twist result in "peace" and nuclear non-proliferation when, if anything, everyone would be clamoring for MORE nukes to go after Mars in retaliation and for self-protection? The movie just asserts that these unlikely outcomes are so, but to just assert such unrealistic things completely undermines the narrative as having any kind of relationship to our reality, despite the repeated attempts to create a parallel.<br /><br />Bottom line, I could not enjoy this movie as over-the-top fun because of the repeated feeling that I was watching an author tract on the nature of humanity, but I could not enjoy it as a philosophical exercise because the events seemed to be so unrealistically asserted that I could see no relationship between this reality and my own. Having said *that*, I can see how a lot of people less squeamish than I might love this movie on its own merits, and it's easy to see that a lot of work and love went into this movie, so if you think you might like it despite the violence and alien nature of the alternate world, you might enjoy checking it out.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

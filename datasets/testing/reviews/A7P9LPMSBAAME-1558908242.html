Time has not diminished it's impact. All the acting is BRILLIANT, but, I think, especially JOHN TRAVOLTA (he excels in everything he does) and SAMUEL L JACKSON (always stellar). Add Chistopher Walken and HARVEY KEITAL--Geez, it doesn't get any better. I must, also, mention Uma Thurmon. Maybe, her best performance ever. Plus Bruce Willis (very good), Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and more. WHAT A GREAT CAST!!<br />Hats off to Quentin Tarentino, who both wrote (not everyone will appreciate the subject matter) and directed this film. He also appears in this too. The time lines and structure of this movie are genius, but this style is truly the mark of Tarentino's work.<br />What's it about? Mostly it's just a day in the life. Of who? A couple hit men, a boxer, a gangster, some wanna' be's, a drug dealer, low rent robbers, perverts and whoever crosses the path of the afore mentioned. It's grisly and there's humor. Plus, the sound tract is great.<br />I have the two disk set, and there are all kinds of good stuff on it--great special features. TAKE NOTE--NOT FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY NOT FOR KIDS, (ie graphic violence, sex, perversion, Drugs, offensive(?) language--you name it. It's a great movie. Quentin Tarentino has one totally,amazing BRAIN.</p></body></html>

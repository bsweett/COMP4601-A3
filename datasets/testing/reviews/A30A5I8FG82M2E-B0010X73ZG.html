That sums it up neatly.<br /><br />The first half is a tightly paced, suspenseful thriller.  Expertly executed, I was fully engrossed for the first hour or so.<br /><br />But then, whoa nelly!  What happened?  Pretension crept in, and suddenly we're watching something that the filmmakers obviously considered more "important" than a monster movie.  And I'm sure many would agree with me - the second half is ultimately more important than the first half.  A great pay-off can compensate for an uneven start.  But a killer start isn't going to really look so good after a soggy, half-baked conclusion.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything.  The movie is fun enough, and worth a rental.  But suffice it to say that when it was over I started thinking of all the movies this one cribbed bits and pieces from.  Let's see, "Night of the Living Dead" (and the other Romero 'Dead' films, for that matter), "The Fog", "Tremors", and about at least a hundred others.<br /><br />As a God-fearing Christian, I took minor offense to the old lady character who preached throughout the movie about how all the scary events taking place signaled the end of days.  We're not all like her and I'm frankly tired of seeing good Christians portrayed in such a bad way.  Peace be with you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I couldn't get engaged with the character, or really care"></head><body><p>It really happened in the early 1960s when a teenager posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer.  He also passed more than a million dollars in bad checks.  All of this happened before his 19th birthday.  He spent time in jail and now makes his living as an adviser to the FBI.  This 2002 film is his story.<p>Christopher Walken stars as the boy's father, who has a financial setback.  Not only does he owe a fortune to the IRS, but he also loses his wife to divorce.  This affects the boy - so much so that it causes his crime spree.  It's all very exciting for a while.  Then he is eventually caught.<p>Leonardo Di Caprio is just not a good actor.  No matter what role he plays, he's like a little kid showing off.  I just couldn't get engaged with his character or really care.  Christopher Walken, however, made me feel the upset of his situation as we see him change from a self-confident business executive into a beaten man.  Tom Hanks stars as the FBI agent chasing Di Caprio.  It's a rather small part and his talent is wasted.<p>The film is 141 minutes - much too long.  I fell asleep through part of it and when I woke up, nothing much had changed.</p></body></html>

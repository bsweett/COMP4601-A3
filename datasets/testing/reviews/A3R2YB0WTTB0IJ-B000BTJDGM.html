<meta name="summary" content="SCOTT DERRICKSON, OPUS 3"></head><body><p>**** 2005. Written and directed by Scott Derrickson. Father Moore goes on trial after the failed exorcism of Emily Rose that lead to the young girl's death. Absorbing movie opposing faith and scientific explanations. You don't have to be a horror movie fan to appreciate this film that is more a courtroom drama than another sequel of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000524CY">The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)</a>. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

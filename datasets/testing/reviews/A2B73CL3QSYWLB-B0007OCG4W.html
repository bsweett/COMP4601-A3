As provocative and engrossing as "Carnal Knowledge" was it was probably one of the more unsettling viewing experiences I ever had.  I felt as if I was eavesdropping on the worst type of behavior people who are allegedly in love could do to one another.  The central characters in "Closer" behave badly as well yet somehow it is a more palatable viewing experience than "Carnal Knowledge".  You cannot conveniently villify any of the principle characters in "Closer".  These are individuals who are caught up in complex emotions and situations that are just overwhelming.  Credit director Nichols and scriptwriter Patrick Marber, whose stage play this film was adapted from, for not providing us with easy answers.  The ensemble cast here is uniformly excellent.  Julia Roberts as Anna probably has done her best work ever here.  Jude Law as Dan gives complexity to a character that could easily be  dismissed as a cad.  Clive Owen's star continues to rise with his account of Larry, the working-class dermatologist.  Natalie Portman is effervescent as Alice, the mysterious stripper.  If you are looking for a provocative film that leaves a little food for thought "Closer" is it.</p></body></html>

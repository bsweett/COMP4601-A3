<meta name="summary" content="Bad Ending & Not the Same Without Jodie Foster..."></head><body><p>Julianne Moore is a phenomenal actress in other movies, but for some reason didn't bring the character of Clarice Starling to life on the silver screen for "Hannibal". Her portrayal of Clarice Starling was extremely flat and dead compared with Jodie Foster's performance of Clarice Starling in "Silence of the Lambs". So, I was sorely disappointed not to see Jodie Foster return to play the role of Clarice Starling in this movie as she gave a vibrant portrayal of this character.<br /><br />I've also read the book "Hannibal" by Thomas Harris and was completely disappointed that the filmmakers of "Hannibal" didn't keep the ending of the movie in line with that of the novel. The ending of "Hannibal", the movie version, felt empty and hollow without the original ending for which the author had intended.<br /><br />Plus other aspects of the storyline were a bit off too. Had "Hannibal", the movie version, had Jodie Foster playing Clarice Starling and other aspects of the movie, like the ending, been more accurate to the novel, I would have given it a higher rating.</p></body></html>

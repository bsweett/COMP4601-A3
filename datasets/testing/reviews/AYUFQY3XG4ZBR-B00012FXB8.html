<meta name="summary" content="It is an improvement over the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot; set, but STILL"></head><body><p>...if I had it to do all over again, I believe I would have bought the movies one 2-disc set at a time rather than all at once in this box set.<p>Buying the box set is a bit easier on the bank account, and there is a bonus 9th DVD that can't be had any other way...but the 9th disc is more of an appendix and even the most hardcore &quot;Alien&quot; fan probably won't watch it more than once.<p>The problem I have with the box set isn't its content; the alternative versions of each movie alone make this latest reissue absolutely necessary...and as each episode in the series has an entire separate DVD's worth of bonus features, a viewer can literally spend an entire weekend watching a single movie.<p>However, the box set's composition is a serious let-down.  Its design means that it must be ceremoniously unfolded each time a disc is viewed.  This puts extra wear on the package, contributing to an early disintegration.  The rubber-based glue used to secure the plastic disc fasteners to the cardboard packaging is also of inferior grade; even the slightest temperature fluctuations cause the glue to lose its cohesive qualities.  The end result is that that the whole thing falls apart.  I'd expect a lot better from Fox, especially considering the fanbase for this franchise.<p>To make a long rant short, buy these reissues.  Even the ones for the chapters you might not have cared for previously; I promise you that they've all been done to the nines and are absolutely worth spending the time seeing again (sometimes as though for the first time).  But steer clear of the box set; Fox has given us a shoddy product in this guise and they must be held accountable by the fans of the series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent; touches the heart; a tear jerker"></head><body><p>If you have a heart, this one's a real tear jerker.  Look past the basic premise of a man trying to get a job.  See the movie very carefully:  it's about a man struggling for survival so that he and his sone can fulfill that American dream:  the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />You just feel bad for Chris Gardner in this movie.  No matter how hard he tried to do something, it seemed like he could never catch a break, but he never let that stop him from trying.  Your heart does go out to him on this one.  Despite the bad luck, he never let showed his son that he lost hope.  He always kept his chin up as he became more and more humbled in his situation.  That's why the end is so poignant and endearing.<br /><br />I could barely see this movie because I cried so hard.  I knew from just watching the trailer that Will Smith would garner and Oscar nomination; however, it was a close call toss up between him and Forest Whitaker portraying General Idi Amin.  Really, really close.  I still would have picked Will Smith because this story seemed to resonate with me, and I would have given this the Oscar for Best Picture, as well, but things as they were, it did not come to pass.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that Will Smith and hisproducer John Lassiter actively sought Italian director Gabriele Muccino to direct this.  Muccino did "the Las Kiss" and "Remember me, My Love".  This whole movie experieince is based upon risk taking.  Will Smith took a risk on Gabriele Muccino to do this movie.  Muccino did a fabulous job being that this was his first non-Italian film ever.  Secondly, they auditioned so many kids to play the son of Chris Gardner, and they couldn't find any.  So they decided to give Will Smith's son a chance to read, and it turned out he was the best audition and he got cast.  So this is a first Father-son movie for Will Smith.  Thirdly, the whole movie centers aorund how the real Chris Gardner took a risk in his sales job to become a stock broker and after hitting a serious low and given his God-given chance, he finally becasme a success.<br /><br />How does a movie like this not get Best Picture?  Well, it's a good story and worth the watch with a good lesson for all.</p></body></html>

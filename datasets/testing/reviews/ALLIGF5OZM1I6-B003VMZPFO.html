Romero<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Breck Eisner<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Horror<br />Release Date: 26 February 2010<br />Review Date: 22 March 2010<br /><br />I never thought I would say this about a horror film, but here I think I have to; they may have made the characters too interesting! I'm serious. I really enjoyed all of the characters a great deal. They were all well acted, well cast and had a ton of depth and believability to them. So my only question is - why didn't the zombies?<br /><br />Typically in these types of films (which I usually love), the characters are two dimensional and the film relies on the blood and gore to keep its heart pumping. Sadly, I would have preferred that in this case, because these zombies were crap!<br /><br />The only reason that I even understand that they were supposed to be zombies, is because that's what everyone else has been referring to them as, and their make-up looks like what we'd find in any zombie flick. They were not at all the traditional living dead that I'm familiar with. They were not scary; they were just lame and annoying. I can appreciate that the filmmakers where obviously trying something different here with these zombies, and I have yet to see the original film, so maybe this is what people will expect and or appreciate. It just wasn't for me.<br /><br />Our two main characters are played to a strong capital T, by two of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Timothy Olyphant plays Sherriff David Dutton, and Radha Mitchell plays his wife Judy. They live in a small town in Iowa, where everyone seems to know everyone, and understandably so.<br /><br />While in the middle of a baseball game, David has a standoff with a local who has a history of being drunk, as he stumbles onto the filed with a shotgun. After David has to kill the man to defend himself, we realize something is wrong and so does David. This guy was a little crazy, you see. Soon others around town start acting a little crazy too, and before we know it, the Military shows up to put everyone under quarantine.<br /><br />Even after having watched the film, I still am unclear as to how exactly it is that you become infected with this virus that turns you into one of these so-called zombies. The film mentions that it stems from drinking contaminated water, which I got, as this is obviously explained to us. But how come one of the main characters goes `beep' when the military scans her with their `zombie detector' and she never turns? How come one of the other main characters starts to show some symptoms of being `crazy', but we never knew (at least to my recollection) that he drank from the water? And why has it taken him so much longer to develop symptoms than the others? I may be overanalyzing a film that's not worthy of it, but I'm only doing so because this film had the potential to be a lot more.<br /><br />It certainly has its moments. The scene that took place in David and Judy's upstairs room was classic horror; I loved the bit with the knife. The scene in the carwash was gore-tastic and thrilling and the sequence with the run-away electric meat slicer put a smile on my face as well. But the zombies man! Come on, does no-one else agree with me that they were just plain boring? They didn't even make sense!<br /><br />They were all different levels of crazy and sometimes killed people, started fires and even went so far as to tie people up while taking them hostage. Seriously? Zombies tying people up? WOW. Why stop there? Why not show the zombies having a picnic by a lake, or why not have them waiting in line at the town's movie theater to go see Dawn of the Dead? Either of these ridiculous ideas would have fit right in.<br /><br />It's also one of those horror movies where even though you love the characters, you want to slap them for doing stupid things. How many more times could David have possibly left his wife alone somewhere with zombies running around? And why did they agree to let their friend walk behind them, at his request I might add, when he began to turn into one of the undead? At the very least they could have allowed him to walk ahead of them couldn't they?<br /><br />Its movies like this that make you feel for actors who hopefully were directed to do these idiotic things. Even if they weren't, it's not their fault it's in the final version of the film.</p></body></html>

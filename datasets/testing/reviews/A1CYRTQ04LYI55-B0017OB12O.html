<meta name="summary" content="Enduring classic"></head><body><p>This enduring classic is (loosely, very loosely) the story of the WW2 POWs used to build the Thai/Burma railroad.  The larger war becomes a personal battle between 3 forces:  The Japanese soldiers looking for labor led by Colonel Saito, the British soldiers looking to serve as prisoners as dictated by the Geneva Convention led by Colonel Nicholsen (Alec Guiness winning an academy award) and the commandos looking to destroy the bridge led by Naval officer Shear.<br /><br />The morality (or more specifically madness) of war is adressed in the movie.  The pointless nature of armed conflict reads true today, as do issues of handling prisoners.  The movie's a long one, but one of the few that justifies the added time.  Every piece is indeed required in this classic.</p></body></html>

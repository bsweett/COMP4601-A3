<meta name="summary" content="smart, gory and fun remake"></head><body><p>Actually, I rate this film as 3 and a half stars. Also please understand, as one reads my following review that I am generally not a fan of gory films.<br /><br />Now released on a finely packaged DVD, this film "ain't" your daddy's zombie movie. Gone are the somnambulant and passive cannibals of old, content to merely stagger in white-faced blackened eyed conformity in search of mass consumerism. Screaming into their place are now the lightening fast, rabid, bloody-eyed ravagers of DAWN OF THE DEAD, utterly devoted to devouring any and all fools who desire to stand defiant. These are un-dead capitalists with attitudes eager to exploit any weakness.<br /><br />This remake of the 1978 cult classic largely eschews the original's blatant social satire in favor of legitimate chills, thrills and gross-out, not to mentioned a multitude of smart film references appropriate for an audience weaned on DVD's, MTV, video games and Reality Television. It also brilliantly utilizes Johnny Cash's apocalyptic "When The Man Comes Around" for a blood soaked opening title sequence that establishes a mood of alienated unease.<br /><br />Like the original, DEAD concerns the survival efforts of a band of humans barricaded in a shopping mall (complete with delightfully narcotic Muzak!) against a gruesome horde. Fortunately, this version boasts a higher budget, raucous alternative rock music score, stronger actors and smart visual allusions to everything from Poe's "The Masque of The Red Death" to ALIEN, THE ROAD WARRIOR as well as the original film.<br /><br />DAWN OF THE DEAD rightly knows it isn't high art. Its number one objective is to scare the dickens out of the audience and provide some great action sequences and a few obsidian-hued barbs at contemporary consumerist culture. Not afraid to embrace a disturbing and down-beat ending, it wisely knows its limitations and, as a result, achieves its goal.<br /><br />The DVD is filled with a truck load of interesting extras. "Andy's Home Movies" and "The News Reports" are both smartly written and entertaining. The "behind the scenes" featurettes is perfunctory yet fun. It is obvious the filmmakers and actors had a great time creating this blood drenched roller coaster.</p></body></html>

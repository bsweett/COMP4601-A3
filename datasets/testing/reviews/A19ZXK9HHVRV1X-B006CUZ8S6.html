<meta name="summary" content="uneven but generally entertaining film"></head><body><p>2001's "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," the first in the series of films based on the J.K Rowling novels, had a strong first half and a weak second.  The follow-up feature, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," reverses that formula, actually becoming better as the movie goes on.  In this new film, we miss that air of freshness and novelty - as well as the wit - that came with the getting-to-know-you opening section of "Sorcerer's Stone."  As compensation, "Chamber of Secrets" offers a better overall storyline and a greater sense of mystery.<p>Devotees of the novels will require no plot iteration here.  Suffice it to say that, in this installment, Harry becomes involved with unearthing the deep dark secret that has the whole Hogwarts Academy in an uproar - a secret involving a mysterious hidden chamber, the death of a student 50 years previous, and an assortment of creatures and monsters that Harry must battle in order to save the school and everyone in it.  This film appears to be far darker in tone than the original, so much so that one wonders if very young children might not be unduly disturbed by some of the proceedings.  For adults, the darkness may make the whole thing a little less cutesy and a little more palatable than the first time around.  <p>Once again, director Chris Columbus has gathered a veritable who's-who of wonderful British performers to flesh out his enormous gallery of characters.  Of the seasoned veterans, the late Richard Harris (in what turns out to be his final screen appearance in fact) brings a quiet dignity to the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and Maggie Smith provides just the proper balance of humanity and stiff-upper-lipped starchiness in the part of Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.  Kenneth Branagh, cut loose from his Shakespearean shackles, seems to be having the time of his life, hamming it up as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a vain charlatan who makes the Wizard of Oz look like the soul of veracity.  Of the neophytes, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are still wonderful as Harry and his buddy, Ronald, but, alas, Emma Watson's role as the spunky Hermione has been sadly minimized in this story for she seems to be off screen more often than not during much of this movie's action.  That's a real shame.<p>In the special effects department, "Chamber of Secrets" does a first-rate job bringing much of the story's magic to life on the screen.  The superb art direction and set design help to create an entire world where witchcraft and sorcery are commonplace occurrences.  Cinematographer Roger Platt brings a nice burnished glow to the film's look, particularly in the castle interiors, which always seem to be lit by soft candlelight.  John Williams' musical score never hits the heights of his great works ("The Empire Strikes Back," "E.T." etc.), but it is adequate to the task at hand.<p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" won't exactly carry you away in the way that the great fantasy films invariably do, but it does make for a couple of diverting hours nonetheless.  Considering what else is out there at the moment, that may be the highest praise one can offer.</p></body></html>

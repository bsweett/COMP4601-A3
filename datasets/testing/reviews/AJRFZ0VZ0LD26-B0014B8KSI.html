<meta name="summary" content="Corporate greed and personal ethics"></head><body><p>One of the "must see films" of the year.  We meet Michael Clayton, NYC lawyer from humble background (Bronx) who after long career in public offices has settled in the last 17 years to being a "fixer" - kind of an attorney who takes care of high profile people in legal trouble.  He is paid well but his gambling habit is taking the best of him.  At the age of 45 he is divorced, with no equity and no law partnership that would guarantee him steady income.  As he is working to find the way out and create a path for his "second" career, Michale stumbles across an old friend who in a fit of seemingly psychotic episode strips himself naked in front of the plaintiffs during the video deposition. We learn about corporate greed and corruption, separation of ethics and billable hours in law offices, personal reflection on the life we lead on both personal and professional level and choices we make along the way.  Tom Wilkinson, Sidney Pollack and George Clooney give startling performances.  Tilda Swinton who earned Oscar for her performance in this film this year for her role of a "Lady Macbeth - like" attorney fades by comparison.  Do not take me wrong -- I grew to be Ms. Swinton's fan since her performance in "Orlando", but this role seems to be waste of her talent.  In any case, I was mesmerized by the story and wonderful effort that actors, producers and director put forth into this film.  That alone gives it 5 stars. You will not be disappointed by this film!</p></body></html>

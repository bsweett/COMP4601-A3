That isn't to say that the film itself is a masterpiece by any means, for I think that it may be a little too aware of itself to be that impressionable, but at the end of the day this is certainly a film you will remember; quite vividly even.  In fact, years after the fact there is a crisp whiteness that I don't think I'll ever forget (the cinematography itself is rather remarkable; the camera catching so much with so little).<br /><br />Robin Williams takes his usual persona and tosses it on its head rather abruptly with his astonishing turn as Seymour Parrish, a lonely and isolated one-hour photo technician who becomes disturbingly obsessed with a young couple who frequent the photo department.  His obsession helps ease his loneliness, as he mentally adopts this family as his own.  That said obsession starts to deteriorate his sanity though, and soon it drives him to acts of unwarranted insanity as he begins to interfere with their lives in ways that are not his right.<br /><br />Williams is certainly in a different zone than usual.  He is effectively creepy and really grounds this film in areas that are a little shaky.  He is wholly convincing and crawls beneath your skin, but not in a way that makes him ultimately repulsive.  In fact, despite his maniacal eventualities, there is something endearing about this crazy man.  You want him to find solace because it is apparent that his overreactions are syphoned from his desperation and internal torment.  He just wants to love, and he thought he found a purity in this young couple he took into his heart, and when realities come to his attention he feels genuinely heartbroken.  Robin Williams conveys that magnificently, and it is his performance that you will remember more than any other aspect of this film (that, and the white).<br /><br />As a whole though, `One Hour Photo' doesn't always find its footing.  I mentioned earlier that the film was a little too aware of itself, and that problem rears its head in areas that defeat the integral purpose of the film.  While Williams maintains his characters depth, the details that permeate each scene can overtake things a bit.  As I said in my review title, it's that coldness that is a double edged sword here.  It is effectively chilling, and that is necessary with this breed of film, but it is that same coldness that can make it difficult to wholly connect with the film.  It is a chilling atmosphere, but it needed a few more shades (maybe a little warmth) to feel complete.  Instead, it becomes overwhelming and comes across almost overtly serious.  It takes itself too seriously, which isn't to say that the film shouldn't feel serious (especially considering the subject matter) but it needed more emotional complexities to feel truly grounded and whole.<br /><br />Robin Williams is outstanding, but the film lacks the shading needed to truly anchor this in greatness.</p></body></html>

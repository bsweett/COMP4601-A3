<meta name="summary" content="More than a few people view this as the best of all the Bond films"></head><body><p>"Goldfinger" is among the most admired of the Bond films.  It has all of the elements that make Bond such a wonderful hero without any of them getting too far out of balance.  There is the usual Bond cool, a certain amount of violence and danger, a great villain and his henchmen, some cool gadgets, and some beautiful girls with outrageous names.<br /><br />Here, none of them get too far out of balance.  Auric Goldfinger is a manic to be sure, but he is still within the realm of believability (for this kind of fiction).  That is, he is a businessman who is calculating and murderous, but not all powerful in his reach or perfect in his calculations.  Neither is Bond.  The gadgets are there, but don't take over the film as they do in some later editions in the series.  And Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is still strong and up to competing with Bond rather than simply being there to fall in love with him and to be rescued by him.  She has more to do with the plot than that.<br /><br />And here the villains, while not deep, do have some interesting aspects for adults to figure out as well as being simple enough on the surface for kids to enjoy.  And the Bond films are full of continuity errors that are a hoot to try and pick up.  You can go to IMDB and read about them, if you want to read about them.  They aren't important to the enjoyment of the movie (or the entire series).<br /><br />We enjoy the opening bit before the titles and are off to the races.  The first collision between Bond, Goldfinger, and Oddjob in Miami is classic, as well as the round of golf outside of London.  The scenes in Switzerland have a classic three level shot that really is quite amazing even today.  And the scenes back in America where the big plan is finally revealed along with Bond's interactions with Pussy Galore build to the big climactic fight.<br /><br />Sean Connery was the great Bond and this performance is one of the best.  Gert Froebe was physically perfect for the role.  I did not know until I watched the movie with the director's commentary that his German accent was so thick that every word of dialogue is dubbed in by actor Michael Collins.<br /><br />Terrific.</p></body></html>

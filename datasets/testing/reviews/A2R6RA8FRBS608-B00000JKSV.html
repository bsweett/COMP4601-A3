<meta name="summary" content="a harsh but brilliant film showings the horrors of war and the potential for violence within practically anyone"></head><body><p>Full Metal Jacket is an outstanding film that grabbed my attention by the throat and never let go until the very last frame of the picture! The acting mesmerized me; it was all done so convincingly and nobody--but nobody--gives a bad performance in this film. The script was well written; the casting well done; and the cinematography and choreography enhance the film as well. The musical score enhances the plot as it moves along; and it's a plot that never left me feeling bored. But please note: this film contains a lot of profanity and graphic, violent war scenes; I would not recommend this film for small children as it might frighten them.<br /><br />Many have noted that the film seems to be presented in two parts; and I would agree with that. The first part takes place on Parris Island, South Carolina, a boot camp for new Marines during the Vietnam War in the 1960s.  The new recruits have to endure incredibly grueling conditions and training by their leader Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) who pulls no punches as he trains them "to be killers." Among the new recruits are Private Joker (Matthew Modine); Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio who plays this to perfection and beyond) and Arliss Howard as Private Cowboy. Private Joker turns out to be quite well suited for the Marines but he is eventually assigned to report for the Stars and Stripes newspaper over in Vietnam; Joker also tries very hard to prepare the ill-suited Private Pyle for combat as a Marine.  However, the stress does take its toll and the first part of the film ends with a tragedy that shows the horrible impact of war even before overseas combat begins.<br /><br />The film then somewhat abruptly changes to military life in and around Hue, Vietnam in 1968; we meet up again with Joker (who now wears a peace button on his uniform) and others including Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), who works for Stars and Stripes as a cameraman alongside Joker; and they do get along very well. Things don't stay happy for long as Rafterman's camera is stolen and both Joker and Rafterman become involved covering the action.  Look also for excellent performances by Adam Baldwin as a Marine who goes by the name "Animal Mother;" "Eightball" (Dorian Harewood) and Ed O'Ross as Lt." Touchdown."<br /><br />I could tell you so much more about the action and the tough decisions they and others must make during some of the brutal action in the Tet Offensive; but then again I'd be spoiling it for you. Of course, some survive and others don't; and the sniper scenes are some of the most riveting I've ever watched in any motion picture.<br /><br />Full Metal Jacket is an excellent film with a message that war is horrific; and the acting will amaze you. I highly recommend this film for people studying the Vietnam War; people interested in gritty war dramas will not be disappointed.  The film also explores the issues of duty, honor and sacrifice alongside a moral ambiguity many soldiers grappled with while they carried on the fight.</p></body></html>

The plot seemed a bit small-scale with two kids trying to fix a toy robot. However, I stuck with it and was pleasantly surprised. Hugo has got an awesome McGuffin. I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say all of the pieces come together in a brilliant way. Hugo's attempts to repair the toy become a story of redemption and forgiveness. The movie makes great use of footage from old silent movies and becomes a celebration of the art of movies. I can't say much more than that, except bravo!</p></body></html>

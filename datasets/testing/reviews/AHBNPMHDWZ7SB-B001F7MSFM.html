It's also a solid reminder of the beautiful mind that director/scribe Guillermo del Tor has. Honestly, I've never been a fan of the comics or the director, but the Hellboy films do a very good job of making you a fan of his. They perfectly compliment his directing style, and artistic preferences. These are some of the best Fantasy films you're going to find out there, and some of the best looking Blu-ray presentations to boot. The cinematography is just gorgeous throughout the entire film. There is a perfect blend of colors, surrounded in darkness that really excites the eyes and sucks you into this magical world. In this magical world live some of the most intriguing creatures that I have ever seen on film. I would even go as far as to say that the creatures in the Hellboy movies are the most original and interesting that I have seen since the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies. And that says a lot, in fact, much more than "a lot" in the day and age where nothing original is being produced.<br /><br />Adding to the artistic brilliance of the film is the score. The music flows perfectly in sync with the story and characters' emotion on screen. Danny Elfman adds another to his list of noteworthy comic book movie scores. The most notible remains Spider-man in my book (even better than Batman). The acting is very good as well. Is there any other role that Ron Perlman was born to play besides this comedic, yet conflicted tough guy? He was really good in the first Hellboy, but in this one he looks so comfortable in the make-up, as if it is his own skin. My favorite character from the first was the assassin, Kroenen. With him dead and gone, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) fills that void. He provides laughs, without coming off as a corny joke. Which could have easily happened if the actor was not up for the task of making that character respectable. Besides those two characters, there are other great performances as well. Most notibly, Luke Goss as the evil elf prince, Nuada. I love it when directors allow actors who are real martial artists to play characters that are also martial artists. I also liked (and hated) Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning. Even I wanted to punch that guy. Selam Blair was not bad at all, but she did not impress me either. Who did impress me was whoever played Johann Krauss. I believe his voice was done by the family guy himself, mister Seth Macfarlane. Now that all of that is out of the way, let's get to what really matters in every summer superhero blockbuster, the action!<br /><br />It is simply amazing. The stuntwork is on par with that of my personal favorite martial artist/actor Ray Park (Snake Eyes/Darth Maul). All of the combat is well choreographed, and the visual effects are even better. All I can say is that I am extremely anxious to see what Guillermo del Toro does with The Hobbit. Peter Jackson can step aside and be assured that his franchise in in very good hands. On a completely different side note, I want to point out the great little Universal easter eggs. I went to Universal Studios today so it's fresh on my mind. I noticed (but their not really hidden) a few quick cameos of a few of the original Universal monsters (The Wolfman, Frankenstein and The Creature of the Black Lagoon) on various television screens throughout the movie. That probally doesn't matter to anyone else, but I thought it was pretty cool. All there is to say about the audio and video on this disc is that they're perfectly captured to deliver one of the best transfers I've ever seen. And to my shock, the extras are as thorough as an anniversary edition that one would expect to see decades down the road. Overall, I obviously love this movie. And even if you aren't as enthusiastic about it as I am, no one can deny the quality of this package.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This might be a minority opinion but I was not disappointed by this version of "I Am Legend'"></head><body><p>My standard for judging "I Am Legend" is not the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">original novel</a> by Richard Matheson but "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>."  I watched the 1971 adaptation starring Charlton Heston last month in anticipation of going to see this new version, a master plan thwarted by classes not ending until December 21st this year.  I also tried to avoid hearing what other thought about this movie, but I did hear whispers about how the premise was great but that audiences were disappointed by the ending.  This might be an inevitable complaint about this story because after establishing the whole idea of being the last man on earth (a point hammered home in the omnipresent trailers for the film), the movie has to deal with the fact the hero is not the last man on Earth, albeit the last one living on the island of Manhattan.  If you think about what Will Smith's Robert Neville life has been like for the last three years, then what happens in this film represents a series of significant changes cascading through the end credits.<br /><br />I think "I Am Legend" is way better than "Omega Man," which is why its rating ends up being two stars better.  Director Francis Lawrence ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MDPYM">Constantine</a>") has the advantage of the stunning transformation of New York City into a true urban jungle, while the screenplay by Mark Protosevich ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXKM">The Cell</a>") and Akiva Goldsman ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN0T">I, Robot</a>") constructs a mixture of set pieces (e.g., Neville deer hunting), simple moments (e.g., Neville picking up a video), and flashbacks to the last time Neville say his wife and daughter.  The irony that a cure for cancer could turn into a plague that decimates the Earth is palatable (never trust a virus), and this time around Neville is a virologist, so he is still searching for a cure three years later.  The best parts of Smith's performance are done in silence; this might be a science fiction film but his work here is solid.  I also like the way things play out in the end, both in terms of the harsh reality of Neville's tenuous situation and also with regards to the psychology of the character that motivates his words and deeds during the end game.<br /><br />There is no attempt to explain every thing that Neville is doing, which makes sense given that unless he is dictating a report in his lab the only other living thing he could talk to is his German shepherd Sam, and the need to explain everything to Sam passed long ago.  The plethora of zombie films in recent years, especially those that have decided zombies no longer lumber around but constantly sprint (to wit, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8L9">Day of the Dead</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN8K">28 Weeks Later"/"28 Days Later</a>") might be misleading viewers into thinking the monsters in this one are zombie-like, but the specific evidence supplied in the film clearly indicates they are vampire-like.  One of the neat things I know about Matheson's novel was that he came up with scientific explanations for the key tenants of vampire lore, and I do wish those parts of the movie had been more explicit, but at least the film is consistent in leaving it to the audience to figure things out.<br /><br />I have yet to see "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a>," so it would be premature to say that "I Am Legend" is the best version of Matheson's novel, but the bottom line is that I was quite satisfied with this movie.  This is not to say that the film is perfect: when other humans show up it seems impossible, given the isolation of Manhattan and who the humans are, that they are able to get there and and do what they do.  But I round up on "I Am Legend" because it rings true that Smith's Neville would have slipped over the line into madness given the personal isolation and demons that have tormented him for three years.  His descent is tragic, which makes the resolution of this film so much more preferable to what happens with Heston's character in the other version.  Besides, I like Neville's taste in works of art to appropriate from MOMA.</p></body></html>

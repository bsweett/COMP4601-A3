<meta name="summary" content="A big "WOW!" to the new DVD"></head><body><p>Most new Disney editions have been improvements over what has come before, but this new edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is an unparalleled improvement on all previous editions.  Before receiving the new Platinum DVD copy I dipped back briefly into my old VHS copy that I had for my daughter when she was a child.  4:3 ratio, poor color, in general nothing special.<br /><br />I then put in the disc for the new Platinum edition.  I was utterly and absolutely astonished.  Widescreen instead of 4:3.  The improvement in the color was unbelievable.  Now, I have to offer a disclaimer.  I watched the Platinum edition on a Philips up-conversion DVD player.  Unless you own an up-conversion DVD player and a high-def TV it won't look this good for you (though it is also available in Blu-ray -- I would love to have checked this out on Blu-ray through my Sony PS3, but I only had the regular DVD).  But with my set up the results were nothing short of spectacular.  I was absolutely thrilled with the results.  Even if you have a relatively low-tech DVD set up, this is going to be a vast improvement over the old VHS edition.<br /><br />SLEEPING BEAUTY has always had special emotional importance for me.  My Dad and I never did much stuff together.  I don't have many childhood memories of just me and him.  But for some reason he took me, when I was a very small child, to the theater to see SLEEPING BEAUTY.  I believe that it was the only movie that only he and I ever saw.  My mother took me to many, many movies, but my father only this.  We would later go as a family to many movies, but this one was just the two of us.  This alone would mark this as a special movie.  This new edition brings back the original big screen experience that I had at the Markham Street Cinema (since torn down) in Little Rock, Arkansas as a small child.<br /><br />As an adult SLEEPING BEAUTY is both a wonderful experience and something approaching self-parody.  There is A-List Disney and B-List Disney.  SLEEPING BEAUTY is without any question A-List.  It was one of the last feature length films done before the institution of the Xerox process.  I consider it the end of the Golden Age of Disney.  It ends the era that began with SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  The self-parody comes out in the endless take offs on elements contained in the film.  The recent (and exceptionally good) Disney film ENCHANTED takes off on the aspects of this film that shows Aurora as intimate friends with wild animals.  It is also seen in SHREK when Princess Fiona sings and makes wild birds explode.<br /><br />The was the last Disney film to be completely hand painted.  ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS, the next major Disney production, utilized a xerox process that eliminated the need for most of the background painters.  The difference between this and subsequent films is palpable.  While the economics of the industry dictated that the switch to Xerox be made, it is truly said that the transformation was made.<br /><br />As a child, I found this to be far and away the most terrifying of all the Disney films.  I stil vividly remember the horror I felt as the Prince chopped his way through the barrier of thorns that surrounded the castle and the terrifying transformation of Mileficent into a terrible dragon.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of SLEEPING BEAUTY then this is a must-owen film.  If you don't know the movie, this is the only edition that you should consider for your first encounter.  As I've learned first hand, all of the Disney re-releases of their movies are utterly first rate.  But this is one of the great Disney movies.  We get not only a exquisite version of a Disney movie, but a first rate version of one of the greatest fims that Disney had mde.</p></body></html>

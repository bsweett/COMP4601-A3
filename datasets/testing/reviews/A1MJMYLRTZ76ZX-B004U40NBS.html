What's next, the lustier side of chess tournaments? Now THAT would be interesting. ;- But to give one example of how the movie unsuccessfully tries to ratchet up the seamy and sensuous side of things, the scene where the ballet master is groping Natalie Portman to show her that she is supposed to seduce him during that dance and then tells her that she should go home and masturbate was ludicrous in the extreme. Yeesh. I'm certainly no prude but who comes up with these ideas, anyway? First-year movie-script writing students who think a little sex will sell even the worst turkey of a movie?<br /><br />To be fair, the movie does has its moments and the acting is more than competent; I just wish it was in the service of a better movie. Natalie Portman is always good of course even if the movie itself is less than stellar. I suppose there has to be some truth to it what with all those young, perfectly toned bodies running around. But for me, a movie about the steamier side of ballet (however true or not) just didn't work very well. I'm not a ballet fan (although I know it takes extreme athletic abilities) so maybe that's the problem. Others mileage may vary.</p></body></html>

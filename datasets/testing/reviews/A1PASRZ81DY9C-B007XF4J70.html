No Contest."></head><body><p>Viewed: 11/02, 11/03, 3/05, 4/06<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />4/06: Casablanca is one of the most honored films of all time and ranks one of the top two most romantic films ever made, rivaling with Gone with the Wind. Serious writing, brilliant acting, ravishing cinematography, and unpredictably thrilling story are throughout the picture. Everything that I desire in a film is all contained in Casablanca. When I think of Humphrey Bogart, I think of him as dark, mysterious Richard Blaine, a typical anti-hero who turns out to be a greater hero than imagined. Ingrid Bergman has never been more beautiful. Paul Henreid is just a classic...easily the best role of his career. Sixty-two years have passed by, there will always be Casablanca, and Casablanca will always have a place in my heart. From the start to the end, Casablanca is impeccably made because every aspect as possible in this film is streamed through without any flaw. It stands the test of time as the better alternative of Romeo and Juliet story. Precisely exquisite and rare, Casablanca is a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perfect gem of a troubled week for the Royals..."></head><body><p>This is brilliantly accomplished by all parties involved. The fictional parts are subtle, the documentary moments are woven into the movie expertly. Acting, writing, direction, photography...kudos to all. Former Princess Diana dies tragically, the British royal family underestimates how fondly the world had accepted her, and the resulting political and personal stress is frustrating to everyone concerned. Compromise, hypocrisy, generational clashes and the crudities and cruelties of our current culture are all touched upon by superb actors.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Evil Dead......."></head><body><p>The Evil Dead(or Book of the Dead, as it was originally called) is a 1981 horror film that was written and directed by Sam Raimi. He's famous for movies such as Darkman, The Quick and The Dead, and Spider-Man. Although this isn't his first film, it is his most widely 'acclaimed' film. The film stars Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. It was made on a budget of $375,000.  It tells the story of five college students who take a vacation in the woods at a cabin which quickly turns into horror when they find an audiotape that is a key to unlocking evil spirits. The film was extremely controversial, in its' day, for its' graphic violence and gore. It is accepted as a classic in the genre these days and has a cult following worldwide.<br /><br />Originally, when I first saw the movie years ago, I didn't like it so much. It was quite different than horror movies of the day back then because of its' excessive use of violence and gore as well as its' dark humor. It wasn't til recently when I purchased the movie that I seen it for what it was truly worth. It's absolutely brilliant. A classic, for sure.<br /><br />If you collect horror movies on DVD, this  is a classic you definitely need in your collection. It stands as a testament of horror movies from way back in the day. You'll get a kick out of it.</p></body></html>

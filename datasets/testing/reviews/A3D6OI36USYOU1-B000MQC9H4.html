If you can process the ludicrous possibility of two total strangers swapping houses, automobiles, and pets for two weeks then you'll probably love this thing. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz provide quite a contrast with Kate as a love starved newspaper editor pining away for the ultra-hateable and totally reprehensible, as usual, Rufus Sewell. And Diaz as a very successful workaholic movie trailer maker whose approach towards relationships can be summed up as she is throwing her live-in Ed Burns out into the street..."NOBODY has time for sex."<br /><br />Next thing you know, these two have met online and agreed to swap houses for the holiday. Its all very cute and there are actually some pretty funny moments as these two acclimate themselves to their new surroundings in Surrey England and somewhere in the vicinity of Beverly Hills. And as this is a film that requires you to check your rational mind at the door, as soon as Cameron is getting settled in, the charming brother in the form of widower Jude Law shows up knocking on the front door and threatening to "take a piss" (they do that in England I think), then he is invited in for a glass of wine and some casual sex. Likewise, as Winslet is enjoying her new digs, Jack Black (who reminds me of what you would get if Joan Crawford had a child with the Hunchback of Notre Dame) shows up with the ultra-hot Shannyn Sossamon as his girlfriend (see, I told ya!)and we're off and running.<br /><br />There's plenty of charm to go around, and most of it provided by Law's daughters. Nothing more charming than two little girls with British accents (see The Rule of Mary Poppins).  The relationship between Diaz and the brother is pretty cool as she comes out of her sexual shell and discovers that she's staring a ready made family right in the knickers. Then across the pond you have Winslet, Wallach, and Jack Black. Hmmmn.<br /><br />This is a classic chick flick, and does make for a good date movie. Face it, this DVD is not going into your collection. Makes for an amusing evening though. BTW, at 2 hours 16 minutes people will argue over whether this movie was TOO long. 3 Passports</p></body></html>

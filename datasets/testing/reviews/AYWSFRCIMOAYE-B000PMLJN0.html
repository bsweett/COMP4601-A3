<meta name="summary" content="This movie is DEAD. Zero star."></head><body><p>This movie is DEAD. It contains no suspense or horror at all.<br />The first 10 minutes stirred up my curiosity a little bit. After that, there's nothing worth seeing left.<br />The special effects are worse than those of tv shows. Here are some examples: Walls crumbling, wooden floors broken and fell to ground, big doll rolling its eyes. Do you think they're scary? I don't!<br />The detective  acted as a child not as a trained professional.<br /><br />Pet Sematary, 28 days later, Slither, Cabin Fever, and the Grudge are still the only ones on my list of Best Horror movies of all times.</p></body></html>

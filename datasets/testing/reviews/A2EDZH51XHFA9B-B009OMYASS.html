Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the Guinea Pig series, they pretty much defined Japanese Extreme Horror in the eighties, and Flower... is the most extreme of the lot. It has no plot; it's just a guy in white face paint and a samurai suit dismembering someone for sixty minutes and change. My copy was a grainy, badly-tracked bootleg, and I was still utterly fascinated at the same time I was repulsed. The main thing that went through my mind is "who would make a movie like this?" When it was over, in some way I have never been able to define, I was changed.<br /><br />I tell you all this at the beginning of this review because, while Hostel falls far short of the high(?) points of Japanese Extreme Horror, as far as American movies go, the films that came before this leave a lot to be desired in the way of bare-bones filmmaking; America's contributions to Extreme Horror have always been somewhat cheesy.<br /><br />Eli Roth, on the other hand, knows how to make a movie; Cabin Fever was one of the best shaggy-dog jokes in years, and the director's cut had gore to rival Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer. Roth obtained the backing of Quentin Tarantino, who was similarly impressed with his first outing, and the two of them set about convincing the MPAA, I presume, that the reason Americans are utterly incapable of meeting Japanese New Horror on its own turf is because we never went through the painful childbirth of Japanese Extreme Horror. So, then, the question becomes-- what happens when you put a better filmmaker in charge of what is, essentially, a spiritually-bonded remake of the extreme revenge films of the seventies?<br /><br />The biggest criticism I can level against Hostel is not a fair one; simply put, it's not Japanese. Americans have a different set of taboos, and Roth wanted to go whole hog, so he's taking potshots at a whole batch of things that Japanese wouldn't even consider. Because of that, the first half of the film tends to drag. Once it gets going, though, you'll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between this and any Charles Bronson film that comes to mind, except you've got marginally better actors here.<br /><br />Two American grad students, Paxton (Ladder 49's Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Dumb and Dumberer's Derek Richardson) are taking some time off from school and backpacking through Europe. While in Paris, they hook up with Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson in his feature film debut), an Icelander with raging hormones. The three of them are traipsing through Europe in a sex- and drug-fueled haze when they bump into Alexei (fellow newcomer Lubomir Silhavecky), who promises them that there's a hostel in a small town in Slovakia that will cater to all their wildest desires. They set out for it, and find it to be nothing short of paradise.<br /><br />Now, the big problem is, you're already halfway through the movie, and the only scene that begins to do justice to the trailers is the opening credits. Those looking for a Guinea Pig-esque experience will no doubt be grandly disappointed by all this. But hang on, folks, things will start looking like the trailers eventually.<br /><br />The best thing about Hostel, by a mile, is the incredible cinematography. Milan Chadima, who normally acts as a second- or third-unit assistant director on his films, is equally at home filming gorgeous Slovakian panoramas, dark corridors, and the acres of nude female flesh that inhabit the first half of the film. Sometimes, with a movie this beautifully shot, it's possible to ignore a wooden script or bad pacing, but you don't need to here; while, as I said, the first half does tend to drag, once we get into the action, the pacing is pitch-perfect, and the main characters usually turn in good, if not exceptional, performances.<br /><br />But you couldn't care less about that. you want to know about the gore.<br /><br />The gore effects are, shall we say, impressive. It's not necessarily that there are a whole lot of them, it's the pervasiveness of the gore-drenched atmosphere in the second half of the film that really makes it all seem worthwhile. It's mostly just atmospheric, which is where the film falls so short of Japan's entries into the extreme horror world, but Roth does get personal with a minor character, Ikana (Puritan beauty Jennifer Lim). It's Ikana who, if this film has the effect on you that Guinea Pig 2 did on me, will leave you fundamentally changed.<br /><br />When you put all the pieces together, Hostel is flawed, but Eli Roth has traversed far more distance than any other filmmaker in dragging America, and its painfully Victorian MPAA, kicking and screaming into the 1980s. The amount of stuff Roth got away with, even in the theatrical cut, is cause for unreserved celebration. I can't wait for the director's cut, to see how much more he had to leave out.<br /><br />The short version of all this is: if you're looking for a nonstop extreme horror ride, Guinea Pig 2 is no longer the obscure, hard-to-find title it was when I was reduced to buying a crappy bootleg on ebay; you can get a gorgeous remastered DVD now. You can even buy it from Amazon. And you'd probably be better off doing do. But if you want a film that's going to attack American values all the way around, where you just happen to get some good gore in the process, and you want something made in America, you will not, as of this writing, find a film that got major distribution anywhere in American history that fulfills the requirements nearly as well as does Hostel. ****</p></body></html>

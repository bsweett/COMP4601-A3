<meta name="summary" content="Not Nearly As Good As The Original"></head><body><p>This movie doesn't live up to the hype. It has some good things going for it, not the least of which is the acting. Meryl Streep has to be the greatest actress of her generation and can do anything. She is amazing here, particularly in her Oedipal scene with Liev Schreiber, who is also well cast. Denzel Washington does a fine job as Major Marco and is convincing as a deeply troubled veteran of the gulf war. But actors need a good script. This one jerks and starts. At times it's silly; at other times the action is repugnant. I do not need to see a man choked to death as he vomits in living color. Thank God for the Greeks for believing that sometimes less is more. Directed by Jonathan Demme, the film is set in the present. I'm not sure what kind of parallels we are to draw here. Is Streep supposed to remind us of Hillary Clinton? She has the drive, the ambition and the haircut but not the political philosophy. Someone drops the phrase &quot;conservative vigilence&quot;. Are we to think the second George Bush here? And a multi-national corporation (Manchurian Global) putting one of its brainwashed own into the White House? Why buy the cow when the milk is free already? The White House welcome mat has always been out for the Enrons and Halliburtons of the world. Let me rephrase: one Halliburton lives in the vice-presidential quarters now.<br /><br /> The writers, to their credit, do not attempt to copy the original and have changed the plot considerably. If only it worked better. Although the movie certainly has it moments, there's a lot of not very interesting, confusing times between the high points. It was a very long 2 hours and 15 minutes for me. I checked my watch often, something I never did in the original movie. Although this film is neither in the league with &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; nor the 1962 version, it is certainly worth seeing if only for the performance of the incomparable Ms. Streep.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superman Turns Back Time"></head><body><p>What happens when you make a film in the year 2006 but make it as if it was the 1980's? Superman Returns is one giant homage to the original. From the opening theme you already know that Singer is in love with the original and wants nothing more then to recreate it for you in the guise of a "sequel".<br /><br /> Four years have passed since Superman left on a wild goose chase and it seems time must have stopped still because this film tries so hard to emulate the first two films that it never becomes its own film. Its one giant wink and if you aren't winking back then this isn't going to be a fun ride.<br /><br />Everyone is miscast and the film has even less action then the original film. By the time they put Superman in the emergency room...if your not laughing as they try to work on him...well then you are taking this movie far too seriously.<br /><br />Thats the main problem is that Bryan Singer took this film way too seriously. Where's the American flag? Where's the modo "truth justice and the american way?" Its no where to be found and yet Spiderman has no problem displaying some good ol' american pride.<br /><br />Perhaps the sequel can liven things up but they have a long way to go and it may take a huge shake up at Warner Brothers to make it happen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Angry Superhero Has Heart?  You Bet"></head><body><p>As the opening credits roll, we're treated to a montage of shots of an experiment gone wrong. Some how, the process turns Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) into a giant green monster, the Hulk.<br /><br />But that was several years ago. (How many, we are never sure.) These days, Bruce is hiding out in Brazil working at a soda bottle company and learning to control his anger.<br /><br />But he can't stay hidden forever, and soon General Ross (William Hurt) gets a bead on his location. He sets up a team to go in and retrieve him, even bring in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help.<br /><br />When things don't go as planned, Bruce decides it is time to head home and get help. But that means reconnecting with General Ross' daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Is there a cure for Bruce's condition? Can the two get it?<br /><br />This movie started our fairly slowly, making me glad that so much hit the cutting room floor.  But once Liv Tyler's Betty is introduced, things really pick up.  Not necessarily the action, but the drama.  Betty and Bruce's complicated relationship captured me and pulled me into the story.  Those two have some wonderful scenes together.  And the two actors capture the tenderness and chemistry perfectly, which doesn't surprise me at all.  Every time I have seen them, I have been blown away by their performances.  Not that I'm detracting from the rest of the cast, who are fine.  And watch for fun cameos by Stan Lee and TV Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, not to mention in the very last scene.<br /><br />The Hulk was created with a combination of motion capture and computer animation.  Sometimes, that foundation was obvious.  But most of the time you could believe what you were seeing on the screen was real.  And they never took me out of the film, which is important because the climatic battle was very emotional, not just some big fight scene.<br /><br />The original Hulk was just okay, but this one really made me care about the characters.  Despite a slow start, I really enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

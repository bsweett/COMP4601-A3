<meta name="summary" content="Faith and doubt--two sides of the same coin which one pops up depends on the day..."></head><body><p>Every morning most of us wake up and flip the coin. On one side of the coin is faith and the other doubt. While this movie deals with the suspicions of an uptight nun (Meryl Streep), a young acolayte (Amy Adams)about whether the beloved Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman)abused a young boy, it's really about doubt and faith (hence the title)as well as what motivates us to embrace one or the other.Father Flynn has taken a young African American boy under his wing--the first in a white school consisting of people of Irish and Italian descent. He clearly identifies with the boy. Different people will come away with different impressions (this isn't really a mystery focusing on whether or not he did it as much as what and why we choose to believe)after watching this and it does reward with mulitple viewings.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks absolutely stunning. I also saw a preview of the DVD and it looks quite good as well. Both have the same special features including a commentary track with John Patrick Shanley. He's engaging, entertaining and informative unlike some solo commentary tracks. We also get a very good making of featurette, one that focuses on the "Sisters of Charity" order that the nuns belong to in the film. We also hear from various nuns as to their impression of the play and film (particularly from the woman that inspired Sister James played by Adams who was one of Shanley's teachers). The only thing missing is a joint commentary track from the cast although Hoffman, Adams and Streep do appear in a segment answering questions about the film, their roles. They all give thoughtful, entertaining and intelligent answers.<br /><br />John Patrick Shanley has done a terrific job adapting his play to the screen making it more cinematic in often subtle (and not so subtle)ways. The performances are brilliant--all three main actors were deservedly nominated for Oscars as was the film itself. Shanley expertly mines his experience raised in the Roman Catholic faith and being taunt at a Catholic school in Boston. Set in 1964 "Doubt" symbolizes the winds of change that were shaking the nation, politics and the Catholic Church with Vatican II. This film isn't really about the Catholic Church nor is it about the alleged abuse itself and how it is dealt with but it's really about the conflict between doubt, faith, old and the new way of doing things in a institution struggling to remain relevant during the turbulent 1960's.<br /><br />In the end all you can do is wake up in the morning, flip the coin and hope for the best but you won't be flipping a coin when it comes to the quality of this terrific drama. There's no risk involved. Highly recommended</p></body></html>

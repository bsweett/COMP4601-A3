<meta name="summary" content="This isn't vengence, it's punishment"></head><body><p>And trust me, when this guy is locked and loaded with an aresonal that can start world war 3, he can take on a whole army if he wanted, but those aren't his intensions; something else is.<br /><br />Frank Castle(Tom Jane) is a cop who acts as a drug dealer faking his guy's death.  And after his successful bust, he and his family after 5 years of no reunion finally party.  But there is was a flaw he overlooked.  one of the men on the other side that got wasted was the son of a weathy man, Howard Saint(John Travoltra) who is more pissed than a pot filled with it.  And vengence was his answer, by letting his troops go on a mad killing frenzy on te saints.  But Frank is still alive, and now, he wants complete payback.  But can he win a one man war with the saints?  Or will the saints be the ones who won, and still stay on top?<br /><br />This movie has alot of gunplay in it, some fighting, a tiny bit of nudity and stuff.  The acting was nice, usally I thought a American trying to be a Bad-@$$(Like Vin Diesel) would just make a horrible flick, but the mixture of a gritty dark tale, and a emotional motive, really made me like Frank Castle, or what he likes being called, the punisher.  It also had some comedy, like when the italian opera music was playing, and the big russian Giagantor dude went to work on Frank.  The one thing I didn't like about the movie, was it said it had prevassive brutal violence.  I really didn't find anything all that brutal.  If you wanna be rocked out of your socks with brutal-shock value violence, well, this really ain't the ticket.  Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q are some disturbingly brutal movies.<br /><br />The punisher is definitly a change from the everyday stupid story, PG-13 weak crap I usally see today.  And this movie has some pretty nice action sceenes from begining to end, altho it coulda had some more blood.  I never read the comic, but after seeing the movie, I'm pretty sure it was a good comic.  If you wanna see a decent action thriller movie, then check this out.<br /><br />peace</p></body></html>

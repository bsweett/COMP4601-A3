<meta name="summary" content="Awesome, simply AWESOME."></head><body><p>Love the movie. I don't know if it gets better then predator. Ever hear of the game Aliens vs. Predator? Well, predator rules. I mean aliens rocks, but the predator is crazy. Basically Arnold is the man. He is the guy to take down the Predator. There isn't that much talking later in the movie, mostly because there is a vicious killer running around, but there is defintely a sence of... fever. Jungle fever to be exact.<p>Arnold is great in this role. He plays the bad boy gunner perfectly well. He doesn't try to act toooo bad, but he does a great job of taking down the baddies. Anyways, the predator is basically a stealth, nuclear bomb, killer, hunting type creature. It looks like an alien got squashed and swollen or something. Actually it isn't as scary as the aliens, but it is creepy.<p>Compared to Predator 2? Its not even a comparison, this movie rocks compared to Predator 2. DTS really adds to it. The Predator could wipe out a city block, and its really cool to see Arnold take him on. 5 o 5 stars.</p></body></html>

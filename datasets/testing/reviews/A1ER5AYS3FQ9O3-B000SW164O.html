<meta name="summary" content="What a waste of  De Niro and Dakota's talent"></head><body><p>Okay, this one won't bore you to tears but it isn't on the level of The Sixth Sense or any other truly great thriller or horror movie. And whatever you do - DON'T take your kids to this one!<br />  The basic plot: Emily Callaway's (Dakota Fanning) mother has committed suicide. Her dad, a psychologist (De Niro) moves to an old house in New York (upstate New York) to start over.<br />  That is when things start to get creepy- or should I say they are SUPPOSED to be creepy? Nothing was surprising in this film except the less than stellar performances of De Niro and Dakota Fanning. Both seemed to be stymied by the script and neither got a chance to exercise their acting chops to the fullest. A pity. Wait for this one on cable. It shouldn't last long in theatres.z</p></body></html>

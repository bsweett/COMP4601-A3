<meta name="summary" content="mid-life comedy, realistically sad, well worth a look if you're over 40"></head><body><p>This is a good movie about a guy who is beginning to question his life - as a motivational speaker who fires people for a living - after a very successful career.  He meets this terrific woman, with whom he shares an hilariously low-key cynicism, in an airport bar on the way to one of his many road trips to whatever kind of a place to fire some more people.  He goes on a roadtrip with a neophyte hotshot that gets him to think a bit more.  They see a succession of airports, hotels, and wounded faces.  It is really quite depressing, but also very funny, kind of warm but knowlingly superficial.<br /><br />Of course, it doesn't work out the way he thinks it will, but he finds himself back on his routine. Nothing is resolved, there is nothing deep, no insurmountable tragedy, just life in America.  And beautifully done.<br /><br />REcommended warmly.</p></body></html>

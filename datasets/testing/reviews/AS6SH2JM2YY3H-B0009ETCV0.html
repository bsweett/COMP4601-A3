<meta name="summary" content="Thriller that will have your heart pumping"></head><body><p>Definitely R rated for violence.  A thriller to the end, with unexpected subplots.  Obviously, hostages are involved.  Bruce Willis was an ex-SWAT hostage negotiator, and is now a small town police chief trying to rescue two groups of hostages, held by different bad guys, at the same time.<br /><br />All bad guys are not created equal.  Lots of cell phones, and bullets are flying.  Plan an escape route in case the movie gets too intense.</p></body></html>

We've had a lot of vampire and zombie movies over the years and many post-apocalyptic movies. I like 'em even if they aren't done that well, as does apparently a large swath of the public. So, I say the first half or so is excellent. Seeing a realistic depiction of a large city devoid of human beings, crumbling bit by bit, nature all around reclaiming ground, is interesting. New York City is the most cinematic location to digitally degrade with cutting edge computer effects with it's famous monuments and streets and gigantic skyskrappers and celebrated bridges. I've found Will Smith to not always be the most interesting actor but his performance works. Basically Smith is a military scientist in responsible for finding a cure for a super-virus similar to the disease in 28 WEEKS LATTER which turns people into fleshing eating crazed turbo-vombies. Luckily for Smith the ghouls in this flick are like vampires destroyed by sunlight. This allows him free reign over almost all of Manhattan during the day, except of course the insides of darkened buildings where monsters shelter themselves from deadly ultraviolet light. Meeting the monsters is the highlight of the movie for me. I was nervous. As for these transformed mutants of the night, they sound scary and look deformed by disease but fake. For the longest time I've said use make-up and masks when you can and cost effective computer effects for the extras--for the background zombies or zombies in dark environments when detail is less an issue. Up close in the light you got video game level quality and that is very lame. Things started to go downhill for me with a strange trap Smith gets caught in that I simply didn't buy and never found a good explaination for. After this his character is disapointing when confronted with a painful loss. Then we discover he is a man without faith in god which is a bad thing?? Not sure where they were going with that and if we're supposed to believe he got it back I simply missed that part--not that I cared in the first place. Without spoiling anything, the final nail on the coffin is the absurd conclusion to Smith's story. The timing of it! Yeah okay. And speaking of timing, got to love the scene on the wharf. Just in the nick of time, outta nowhere...What are those odds? In the end the movie wraps up and your just left with an uninteresting conventional movie.</p></body></html>

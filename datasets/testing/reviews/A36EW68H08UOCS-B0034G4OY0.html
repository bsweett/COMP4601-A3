<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's Thoughtful Meditation on Life After Death"></head><body><p>Eastwood the Director may wind up in history more well-known than Eastwood the Actor, and for the man who played Dirty Harry and The Man With No Name, in addition to brilliant starring roles in his own films such as Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby - that is saying something.<br /><br />Hereafter is a film with three different plots headed toward a common destination.  In one strand Cecile De France plays Marie, a Parisian Journalist who is saved from drowning in a tsunami and finds that she can't extricate her private and professional lives from the experience.  Frankie and George McLaren play twin brothers Marcus and Jason.  The brothers have a drug-addicted single mother and share the task of shielding her and themselves from the authorities before tragedy strikes.  In the final thread Matt Damon plays George Lonegan, the character you know the other characters are moving toward.<br /><br />George has the ability to talk to the dead through contact with people who have connections to the deceased.  He explains halfway through the film that he developed this ability after a near-death experience, and although his brother (played by Jay Mohr) thinks "the gift" is a gold-mine that should be exploited, George tries explaining repeatedly that it is a curse rather than a blessing.  (Any person George touches floods him with images of the dearly departed.)<br /><br />The film moves slowly.  After the opening Marie doesn't want to be a journalist so much as explore the world of near-death experiences.  We see young Marcus visiting sham psychics.  In a series of scenes we see Damon's George reluctantly give "readings".  One of the strengths of the film is that it contrasts the work of the fake psychics, who use clues obtained reading body language and facial expressions, with the dilemma of a person like George, who can't turn his power off, which invariably makes it impossible for him to develop actual relationships. How can you be "normal" if every time you touch a fellow human - you see dead people? Bryce Dallas Howard plays a pleasant woman George meets in cooking class.  George attempts to hide his psychic ability from her, but when she finds out, she pressures him into a reading.  What begins looking like a simple parlor trick instead rips open decades-old wounds.<br /><br />For action addicts the film moves glacially after the tsunami scene, but the emotional payoff at the end is worth the trip.</p></body></html>

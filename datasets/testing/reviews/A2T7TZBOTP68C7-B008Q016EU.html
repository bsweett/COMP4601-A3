<meta name="summary" content="Great  updated tribute to the Angels"></head><body><p>In 2000, media rumblings had Charlie's Angels: the Movie set to tank like Waterworld.  Reports of Bill Murray and Lucy Liu refusing to work with each other, rapidly inflating budget, and former angels declining cameos had many folks apprehensive about the film's success.  But the finished product was refreshing and worth waiting for.  Ironically, in persevering with the film,<br /> the three young stars and co-producers, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Liu followed the Angels' creed of never giving up and believing in yourself.<p>From the familiar opening strains of the TV show's music to the end, the movie remains true to the original series, yet is modern and updated.  Barry is cute, Liu is tough, and Diaz simply dazzles.  Lots of humor and action make this film a must-see.  There is one especially hilarious scene that makes fun of engineers.  Two of the angels dress up as men, and Liu dons a black leather miniskirt to distract the men.  It works very well as the engineers are all falling out of their seats and looking at her in awe as she works the "dominatrix" role.  <p>And it is great to have John Forsythe back as the voice of Charlie.  At least he was a good sport about it; a true gentleman like Charlie!</p></body></html>

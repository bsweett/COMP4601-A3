Indeed, when the giant grizzly shows up at his bus I was praying it would put him, and us, out of our collective misery.  (Note to Hollywood, basing a movie on an interesting true story does not automatically guarantee an interesting movie.)<br /><br />What the film does do convincingly is reaffirm the idea that - despite considerable acting skill - Sean Penn remains a very simple-minded man drawn to naive, two-dimensional explanations for multi-faceted, complex questions.  What McCandless did is remarkable, what's remarkable about this movie is that it fails to provide any insight at all into why he did it.<br /><br />To risk life and limb, to renounce the advantages of bourgeois society, to abandon family, to live a life so solitary monks would think it odd - demands intense motivation.  We are offered the obligatory bait of Thoreau, but Christopher isn't running into the embrace of nature, he is fleeing the company of men.  We're thrown a scrap or two about contempt for the hypocrisy of society and worship of all that is material.  But Chris is only too willing to ride rails, hitch in cars of all types, and nestle into a hunter's cabin (bus) that has been well outfitted.  We understand most vividly what he actually is as he negotiates the soft underbelly of L.A. at night - he's a bum.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the story, Emile Hirsch is affable and charming - which helps perpetuate the myth that Chris is some well-intentioned social misfit having a bit of soul-searching adventure.  For this story to make any sense at all, that can't be true.  If the story had had human interaction, we might have gotten to know him.  (As Sean Penn's incredibly heavy hand points out at the end of this film, the happiness Chris seeks can only be found in sharing with others.)  But even on those rare occasions when we have the illusion of contact, (Holbrook, Vaughn, Keener), Chris is an emotional succubus, unwilling to share anything truer about himself than the word, "Alaska."<br /><br />Although we never see them, three forces drive Chris.  The first is an intense anger, even hatred, lurking beneath that boyish smile - hatred for his parents, his father in particular, and ultimately, self-loathing.  (How else can we explain his willingness to let them agonize about his fate?  He wants to hurt them.)  Next is a staggering narcissism - his self-seeking is done in a void, as if all other people are merely extras in his movie.  Last is an addictive attraction to self-destruction, his self-destruction is an orgasmic narcotic, and it is also an act of revenge.  Hirsch and Penn are equally to blame for this failure.<br /><br />What's best about the movie - the Alaskan scenery and other jewels of cinematography - is also what's worst, it's a lovely distraction.  The quest that Chris allegedly embarked upon does not lead into wild nature, but into the wild heart.  Make it out of there alive, and you've got a real movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Red Eye"></head><body><p>Lisa Reisert (McAdams) is heading home to Miami to see her dad (Cox).  Of course, her leaving for home puts the hotel she works at in a bind.  She apparently is the one that kept everything moving smoothly.  When her fill-in calls her looking for some help, Lisa is able to diffuse the crisis over the phone.  Thank God for cell phones.  Then, while waiting for her delayed flight, she meets Jackson Rippner (Murphy).  They have a few drinks in the lounge, and then find themselves sitting next to each other on the plane.<br /><br />They have hit it off and things are going well for Lisa.  Then she finds out that Jackson is not what he seems, and his ulterior motives are going to make this an awful flight for her.  It seems that he has a task for her to perform, or her dad will pay the price.  Now, trapped on a plane with her dad's life in danger, Lisa must figure a way out of this crisis that could have far reaching consequences.<br /><br />"Red Eye" is a fast moving, edge of your seat thriller.  Director Wes Craven keeps ratcheting up the tension until the very end.  Murphy is perfect as the crazed Rippner, especially when all out craziness is required.  McAdams is believeable as the woman who is used to being in control of everything.  "Red Eye" is a good, fast-paced and entertaining thriller.</p></body></html>

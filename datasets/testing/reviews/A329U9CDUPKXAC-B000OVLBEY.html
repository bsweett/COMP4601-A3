<meta name="summary" content="It was as bad as it looked"></head><body><p>I wouldn't say that Nicolas Cage ruined this movie. It was more of a collective effort. Let's start with the writer and director, Mark Steven Johnson. He also made Daredevil which is surprising because that was actually a good movie if you saw the director's cut version. But no amount of reediting can save Ghost Rider.<br />Nicolas Cage is responsible for creating a character that is part Elvis part idiot. Johnny Blaze starts out the movie being played by Matt Long. And that was actually the best part of the movie because he was going a great job with the character. Once you bring in Nicolas Cage, it all falls apart. This guy takes cheesy dialog and finds ways of making it ten times worse. And he can't pull off that wig he's wearing either. I will give him credit for getting his body in shape though. I'm sure he worked in his contract where he gets to appear shirtless. But that was also one of the most painful scenes in the movie as Cage is making goofy faces at his mirror.<br />Oh, and we're supposed to believe that Matt Long grows up to be Nicolas Cage? That's an insult to Matt Long who...isn't ugly.<br />Now on to Wes Bently who played Blackheart. This guy couldn't act to save his life. Bently can sleep at night knowing he played the lamest villain ever in a super hero movie. And I'm counting Sharon Stone who played Brick Girl in Catwoman. There was only one way Ghost Rider could defeat this guy...and he LETS him!<br />So Ghost Rider is a super hero movie, right? An action movie? Where was the action? I'll spoil the movie right now. Ghost Rider defeats his enemies by saying "Look into my eyes" and then they burn up. That's it. He looks at them. Wow! Cool huh? There are a group of bad guys he has to defeat. None are any challenge AT ALL to him! All he does is look at them! Oh..and one time he twirled his chain.<br />The special effects were, at times, pretty cool. But they don't make up for the horrible writing, directing, and acting. This ranks up there with one of the worst comic book movies ever made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great movie that is not spoiled by truth or reality ....."></head><body><p>Ok so we have the stories of King Arhur and the knights of the round table, Excalibour, the Lady of the Lake, Sir Lancelot, Merlin, etc. all burned into our mind with fairy tales and very romatic stories of love, treason and so on. This movie takes it all on and presents us with a great adventure of King Arthur before he was the King.<br /><br />The movie presnets us with Arthur as being a general of the Roman army in Briton on the Northern borders battling with bands of local Briton tribes that wanted independence from the Romans, and battling agains the invading Normans (Vikings) who had aspirations of capturing the island for temselves by pushing out the Romans.<br /><br />Historicall it all makes sense of course and it seems like that has really bugged out a lot of critics..... yeah ... do not let reality or history spoil our childish vision of King Arthur ...<br /><br />OK the move is exciting .. has some of the greatest battle scenes almost reaching the excellence of the battle scene in Gladiator where the Romans vanquish the barbarian hordes .....<br /><br />Ok one thing bugged me is that there are a lot of dark scenes, foggy scenes but I guess for the sake of reality, I mean it was mostly set on the northern hills and mountain border of Britain, means that the viewers has to make one concession at least ...<br /><br />Wonderfully entertaining and informative movie ....</p></body></html>

The film tells the story of tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) as he goes through the process of bringing smoking back to the movies and in turn reconnecting with his young son.<br /><br />The film has a great ensemble cast and witty dialogue but doesn't really develop its story line to the point I would have hoped. As political satire it walks a thin line between high comedy and silliness.<br /><br />The high point of the disc comes in its special features. The disc offers two commentaries, an episode of the Charlie Rose show, two making of featurettes and various art galleries.<br /><br />This really could have been a great  movie as it turns out it was merely good. Worth a rental.</p></body></html>

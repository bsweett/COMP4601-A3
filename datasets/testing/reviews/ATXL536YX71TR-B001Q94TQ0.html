<meta name="summary" content="Maria Full Of Drugs and Desperation"></head><body><p>I have always said that HBO Films KNOWS how to effectively and rivetingly tell a story that is poignant and unforgettable without resorting to all kinds of gimmicks and splashy techniques.This is a crowning achievement for HBO and MARIA FULL OF GRACE delivers the goods (pun intended)in a taught and tense 101 minutes of well calculated story telling with real character angst.<br />Maria Salazar,supremely portrayed by Catalina Moreno,wants to get "out of dead-end Dodge"-here,it's Colombia,South America.From the outset of this film, Maria shows her feistiness and tenacity to speak up to her boss,her family and her boyfriend making her the perfect candidate for a decision that she will make that will alter her life forever.But this is not your usual situation faced by a two-month pregnant seventeen year old who wants a new life! She meets Franklin who sets her up as a "mule", a stubborn woman who has the courage and composure to swallow over sixty balloons of heroin and deliver them in her belly to New York City.The narrative never allows you to agree or quite disagree with her decision.She is young,she is desperate, and she honestly does not fully understand the immense risk she is taking.That is what makes this film so compelling and the character of Maria so rich;we simply cannot judge her.<br />The process of swallowing the drugs will make you wince and cower.The camera sneaks from face to face aboard the New York bound plane which also has three other Colombian "mules" on board.Your palms will sweat and you will feel the tension that these girls undergo.What happens next is up to you to find out.<br />No small wonder this film was so popular at the 2004 Film Festivals with it's numerous wins.It also received a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination.<br />The film is in Spanish with very readable subtitles.The commentary by writer/director Jonathan Marston is insightful and fluid.The VHS tape is also excellent for purchase.<br />Very Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mirren is The Queen"></head><body><p>The Queen traced the week immediately after the death of Princess Diana in 1997. The movie traced the motivations and actions of Queen Elizabeth as she totally misread the mood of her country regarding Diana's death and her gradual horror at her mistakes. She is aided by her Prime Minister Tony Blair who almost against himself, aided, advised and nurtured Queen Elizabeth back to reality. It pretty clear by this movie that without Blair, Elizabeth would have suffered major damages to her reputation and name. She owed him a great deal for his services toward her. (Maybe a future knighthood or peerage might even the honor.)<br /><br />Helen Mirren proves to be totally superb in her role. Was there any doubt of her Oscar? She was probably the only sure bet to win. Her performance nailed Elizabeth II right on the money and managed to conveyed the queen's actions and moods following Diana's death. In some way, the real queen owed her a great debt for portarying such a sensitive role. Mirren was well supported by her supporting cast, great script and sublime directing. Michale Sheen was also great as Tony Blair and James Cromwell probably captured Prince Philip's caddish and tunnel vision behavioral pattern down pretty good.<br /><br />Overall, one of the better movies to come out in 2006, Helen Mirren's performance would be hard to beat in any year.</p></body></html>

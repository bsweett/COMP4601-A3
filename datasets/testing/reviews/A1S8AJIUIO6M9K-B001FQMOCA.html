<meta name="summary" content="One of the Great Musical DVDs, a Metaphor for Life as Well"></head><body><p>This is one of the really great musical DVDs; I list others below but because of Amazon's limitations, I can only list ten.<br /><br />This is NOT a complex biographical DVD.  This DVD captures the essence of love within music.  It is a glorious story of a man who married well but whose wife did not "compute" music, and of the love that grew "on the road" between Johnny Cash and his eventual bride (who got him off drugs and helped him "walk the line").<br /><br />The underlying theme, of going from uncotrolled use of drugs to a straight existence within reality powered by love, is uplifting.<br /><br />If you like both music and romance, this DVD is a "must have."  Below I list a few others.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094ARN2">Beyond the Sea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKS8">Yankee Doodle Dandy (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAO">For the Boys</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630522577X">My Fair Lady</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HT3PGA">The King and I (50th Anniversary Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094AS9U">Bride and Prejudice</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002WZTHA">Ray Charles Live - In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY">De-Lovely</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008973A">A Chorus Line</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04OM">The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)</a></p></body></html>

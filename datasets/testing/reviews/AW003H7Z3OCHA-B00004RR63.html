<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Home Theatre/HDTV/16:9/480P DVD Review!!"></head><body><p>This is my 3rd Home Theatre DVD Review and &quot;THE TERMINATOR - Special Edition&quot; gets it right on the second time around. Now that Home Theatre is more common many early released movies are being re-released with many enhancements &amp; extras.<br />This movie definitely set Arnold Schwarzenegger to the super star level. Under the direction of James Cameron (Titanic) this scfi thriller has Schwarzenegger cast as the ultimate bad guy in the futuristic bombed out Los Angeles (2024 AD and 1984 AD). A complex plot with lots of action &amp; special effects that we expect from a Schwarzenegger movie!<br />Brief movie summary - 2024 AD LA is ruled by Robots &amp; Arnold plays a Killer Android sent from the future to &quot;TERMINATE&quot; a woman who will bear a future &quot;PATRIOT LEADER&quot;. In turn the &quot;Patriots&quot; send a human warrior to safe guard this woman from the Killer Droid. This makes for a real interesting twist of fate for the woman.<br />This DVD is All new Master from a HI-DEFINTION TRANSFER / Enhanced for WIDESCREEN 16:9 / NEW 5.1 Stereo Remix. In a nut shell - AWESOME VIEWING &amp; LISTENING!!!! Lots of extras including Interviews with Schwarzeneggar.<br />If you love the BIG THEATRE this one brings it home!!!!</p></body></html>

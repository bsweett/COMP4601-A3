<meta name="summary" content="Matrix?  What Matrix?  Great Libertarian Action Flick!!!"></head><body><p>Silly, predictable, seriously flawed, with moments that are outright laughable, Equilibrium nonetheless transcends all of these and through its compelling performances and fun pseudo-comic book settings delivers a powerful emotional punch that should resonate strongly for anyone who loves stark, stylistic Orwellian drama.<br /><br />In a future dominated by Father (with a not so subtle nod to "Big Brother"), emotions have been eliminated and feeling is a crime, punished by immediate incineration - along with things like art, music, literature, friendship, love and everything else that makes life worth living.  Wisely, there is an underground rebellion contingency who continue to "live."  Among them, Emily Watson's saintly, emotional Mary O'Brien.  These folk are, naturally, hunted down by the Grammaton Clerics, that physically fit bastion of unfeeling purity out to uphold and enforce the law.<br /><br />Christian Bale as Cleric John Preston gives a performance that is simply terrific offering a fascinating character study.  One witnesses in anticipation as, throughout the slow process Preston's emotion free automaton - the pride of the Tetragrammaton - evolves into freedomfighter and ultimately liberator. Watch as, for the first time, Preston listens to music (the opening measures of Beethoven's 9th Symphony) and through his face captures and reveals the range of awe and wonderment as though awakening from a lifelong coma.  Bale is more than up to the task as we watch his Cleric struggle with his newfound duplicity and makes route for him, but still believe the man may very well fail his mission.<br /><br />Director, Kurt Wimmer, in what appears to be his first big screen directorial job, has created an entire new, faux martial arts: "Gun-Kata."  Gun-Kata is a highly stylized combination of two handed gun fighting and classic tai-chi/martial arts movement based on "a scientific analysis of bullet trajectory and range" combined with mathematics, etc.  At first, it is almost painfully hilarious to watch, but give in and it achieves a type of anime, hyper realistic that can only be described as "wicked cool!"<br /><br />Bale's Preston is THE master of Gun-Kata and as he inevitably goes after "Father" his penultimate fight with former partner Taye Diggs' will leave you cheering.<br /><br />Like a great conductor, Wimmer brings together all of the disparate elements of his symphony with its wordless, choral based soundtrack, jumps every hurdle and flaw, delivering a terrific movie full of action, meaning and emotion.</p></body></html>

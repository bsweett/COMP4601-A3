<meta name="summary" content="Amazing!  No wonder it scared me as a child"></head><body><p>Summary:<br />Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer looking for some time to get away from the hectic humdrum of modern life so he can focus on writing.  Hearing that a a Colorado resort, The Overlook Motel, closes for the winter because of extremely deep snow but needs a maintenance person to stay there during the winter months to prevent major damage, he signs up, bringing along his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd)...<p>My Comments:<br />I remember seeing this on TV (edited obviously) when I was younger, but I didn't remember much of it by the time I watched it again, just a few shots of Jack Nicholson's crazed face.  I can only guess that I tried to forget it as a child so I could sleep.  This must be a very disturbing movie for children seeing as how Danny's father, one of the people he is supposed to be able to trust, is trying to kill him.  <p>Of course, I'm no longer a child and my opinions have changed.  Watching this as an adult I found the movie to be absolutely entrancing.  There are some problems, of course, but nothing particularly major.  First, as the movie worked its way into the depths of Jack's mania my wife and I were discussing what we believed would happen (I really couldn't remember the plot, so this was a fair discussion).  It wasn't that hard to guess based upon the setup - ...  But despite knowing pretty much what was going to happen, there were still a number of unpredictable surprises.  I found the delusional conversations with people out of the past of the motel to be particularly engaging.  <p>The other problem I had with the movie was Shelley Duvall.  Is she not the biggest whiner and wimp you have ever seen?  I think it really came out in the 'making of' featurette that she is all about getting attention; she's like a spoiled child.  Perhaps this worked perfectly for her role, her constant crying and giving in to Jack, but just the story itself and the performance by Jack Nicholson were probably enough to guarantee that whoever played his counterpart would be good.  Not that I can really question Kubrick's decision, it did, after all, work very well, but Duvall is still whiney and annoying.<p>One final comment about the special featurette on the DVD... Though the behind the scenes shots included in the featurette were very interesting and gave a nice additional perspective to what was going on, Vivian Kubrick is not Stanley.  Apparently she hasn't tried to hard to follow in her father's footsteps, thank goodness.  I don't know how you could really spoil the 'making of' featurette of this movie because pretty much everything about the movie is fascinating, but the way she arranges the clips and includes some bizarre shots is more distracting than entertaining and educational.  There isn't really much of a need to be overly artistic with a 'making of' video.  <p>Overall, I don't think I would recommend this movie for children.  However, after having seen it I think I'd like to visit the 'real' Overlook Motel (the outside shots were of Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon) to get a pictures; I drove through Fargo, ND for the same reason.  It's a great movie with a classic performance by Jack Nicholas.  If you want to be entertained by a classy thriller, see The Shining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Metaphysical grafitti [3.25 stars]"></head><body><p>Some occasionally clunky dialogue and awkward moments (what the hell kind of night school cooking class coerces students to participate in flirty/sexy blindfolded tasting exercises?) don't hobble this sprawling, somber mosaic about the work of getting through life while facing both loss and the inevitability of death.<br /><br />The film reaches high for answers it can't possibly deliver but, still, reach high it does, to satisfying effect. Had I not known this was a Clint Eastwood joint beforehand, I never would've guessed (although the spare guitar recalls the theme from "Unforgiven"). It can't be a coincidence that he took this subject for what has to be one of his final films.<br /><br />Cecile de France, as one of the leads, is gorgeous to the point of special effects, and the opening scene -- an astonishing depiction of a tsunami that struck Indonesia in 2004 -- is one of the most moving, most harrowing sequences of the past year, amazingly executed.</p></body></html>

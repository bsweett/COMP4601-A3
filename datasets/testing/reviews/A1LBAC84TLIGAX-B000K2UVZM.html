<meta name="summary" content="SO MUCH POTENTIAL, SO MUCH WASTED  6 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I like crime dramas, they are a very sophisticated form of film and most of them have been compelling and rather interesting and they really know how to deliver plots and twists. This film however, squanders the potential it has by not taking its interesting ideas anywhere. Scenes go back and forth and really don't have much to do with the Black Dahlia murder most of the time, but rather it feels like a chronicle of the life of a cop and his sexcapades while supposedly investigating a murder.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The time is 1947, and a young fledgling star named Elizabeth Short is found dead, cut in half and her face mutilated. Two detectives Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard are assigned to the case and uncover a plethora of of buried secrets and lies about the murders, all while having relationship problems and threats of being kicked off the investigation for numerous reasons, and sleeping with every chick that comes their way.<br />STORY: SCORE- 5.5 OUT OF 10- The story presents a lot of interesting ideas, but never properly implements them into the fabric of the plot. Randomly cramming in scenes of sexuality and girl-on-girl scenes is not going to make a compelling crime drama, but rather it is a bit of annoyance, it's more of something that should be kept in the privacy of the bedroom. I'm fine with maybe one or two scenes of that nature, but it cannot be a major component of the damn plot.<br />MUSIC: SCORE- 8 OUT OF 10- I've always enjoyed the jazzy cop noir themes of this kind of music and it is present and accounted for in here, but it's not the best music for these kinds of themes.<br />COMPELLING FACTOR: SCORE- 6 OUT OF 10- The story is fairly enjoyable, but the plot twists really aren't things you haven't seen or heard before, so basically it's the same old song and dance of age-old plot twists.<br />PORN FACTOR: SCORE- 8.5 OUT OF 10- There sure are a lot of scenes of sexuality, and why have these girl-on-girl scenes been added?<br />PLOT TWISTS: SCORE- 5.5 OUT OF 10- There is basically nothing shocking, nothing surprising, or for that matter, anything you haven't seen already, go get your fix elsewhere. Go, just walk away and go find another crime drama.<br />OVERALL: SCORE- 6 OUT OF 10- This film's mediocrity is shocking, especially since it was made by the director of Scarface, a much better crime drama. What makes this film all the more sad is the fact the short film; Detective Story from the Animatrix; had a more compelling plot than this... and it was nine minutes long. You're better going and getting your fix from films like Pulp Fiction, Scarface, The Godfather, The Departed, or the superbly crafted animated film Renaissance, or perhaps Sin City. Whatever your preference, you're not missing anything if you don't watch this movie.<br />THE GOOD: Interesting story ideas, good music, some okay plot twists.<br />THE BAD: Good ideas don't go anywhere, it's more focused on the sexcapades of a detective and boring relationship problems.</p></body></html>

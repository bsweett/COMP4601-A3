<meta name="summary" content="He ain't no Maximus!"></head><body><p>Wow. Some of you guys are cold. It seems unfair that actors who have made millions being sullen and anti-heroic (Pitt, Cruise, Farrel) now get a chance to play a completely out-of-character role of a man embroiled in myth like Achilles, Nathen Algren and Alexander, and are then compared to the one guy who could pull it off, Crowe. And they are found wanting.<br /><br />Brad Pitt spends a year in the gym pumping up for Achilles, Cruise practiced Samurai combat for 8 months to get ready for "The Last . . . ." and Farrell, well he kept dying his hair different shades of blond to get the right Macedonian lilt.<br /><br />But in the tradition of Arthur and Modred and Lancelot and Spartacus and Ivanhoe, it's hard to beat Russell Crowe. He was born 50 years late! So comparing Orlando Bloom to the Maximus character isn't going to work.<br /><br />I believe the problem with any 2005 movie with Jerusalem as the venue makes folks generally nervous. I don't know what to think of it. You know you want to say if it is a Holy City it certainly has been the site for such extraordinary suffering for the last 2000 years, and suicide bombers and car bombs and rocket attacks notwithstanding, it still is.<br /><br />Generally the plot was a relatively accurate description of what every other historian referred to as following the Dark Ages. The tranquil time (that's a relative term) between Crusade II and Crusade III.  Bloom is credible and Eva Greene as Syballa was beautiful in the long hair or short hair version and the presence of powerful men such as Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson gave it direction. Like all huge movies, sometimes homeric film shots gave way to our understanding of the purpose.<br /><br />Poor choice of a topic during a time of great political unrest. Good story worth seeing. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

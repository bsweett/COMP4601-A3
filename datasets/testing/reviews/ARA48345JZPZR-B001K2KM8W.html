<meta name="summary" content="A darkly beautiful Original..."></head><body><p>This remarkable film about the power of imagination to transcend the arbitrary cruelties and injustices of the "real" world is itself a powerful and wonderous expression of Guillermo Del Toro's considerable imagination and creativity.  Having no preconceptions, I was drawn into this beautiful and dark vision of the intersection of reality with myth much as a child tentatively enters the brooding and foreboding forests of the Brothers Grimm.  I was surprised at the courageousness and honesty of the story's unflinching depiction of the cruel Captain and the frightening places the young heroine goes in her imaginative quest.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film to behold, with a wonderful use of color amid evocative production design with just the right touch of CGI.  A savagely lush tale frought with tension and ultimate tragedy.  I had no idea where it was going and was greatly touched by, to me, an unexpected resolution.  A thoroughly original and brilliant conception, delivered with great care and intelligence.  I first noticed Del Toro with the film Mimic, and thought the guy has some good chops.  I had no idea that the man would be capable of such a strangely beautiful mythic tale, a fairy tale of monsters, human and other worldly, transcended.  A one of a kind film, well worthwhile.</p></body></html>

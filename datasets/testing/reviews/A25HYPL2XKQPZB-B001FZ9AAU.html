<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man rocks! A great summer movie even for Iron Man novices"></head><body><p>I'm not a comic book fan at all. So I know about Spiderman, Superman and Batman, but I know nothing of some of the "minor" superheroes that end up starring in big budget motion pictures. I know nothing about Iron Man's origin, the villians, and all of the backstory that go into the universe he lives in. Is the movie, IRON MAN, a movie I could enjoy when I don't know about or really care about Iron Man? The answer is YES. Bases on box office returns and great reviews, the public loved this movie. The critics got this one right. This really is a good movie.<br /><br />The strength of the movie starts with the cast. You have Oscar winners Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Downey is excellent as Tony Stark, the rich industrialist weapons manufacturer. Stark is a womanizing playboy who has every gadget imaginable, but few if any true friends. Pepper Potts (Paltrow) is his harried assistant who perhaps harbors long buried feelings for Stark. Jeff Bridges is okay as Obidiah Stane, Stark's partner who has big things in mind for Stark Industries. Perhaps the best thing about Bridges' performance is his bald head and huge beard. It is pretty funny. The rest of the cast is stellar.<br /><br />The plot seems to be standard superhero stuff. I was worried that the movie might try and make a politcal statement about war. After all, the plot involves a gigantic weapons manufacturer and Islamic terrorists. The movie wades through these waters with ease, giving it realism while never offending any one's political beliefs.<br /><br />The movie has some violence that could be too harsh for younger children. There is some adult situations but no bad language. The sountrack is great and the set designs (like Stark's house) are incredible. This is a fun movie and I know I'll never read an Iron Man comic book, but I can't wait for the next movie.</p></body></html>

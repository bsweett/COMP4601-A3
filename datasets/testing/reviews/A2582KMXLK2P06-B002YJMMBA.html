Being a non-religious person nor someone who follows the Pope or the religious history connected to the events portrayed in the film (whether fictional or not, it doesn't matter) I wasn't able to comprehend a single thing concerning any of the stuff presented in Angels & Demons so as you can probably imagine, I was completely confused and unsatisfied.<br /><br />The second half of the film is devoted to quite a bit of action and suspense, however not being able to even remotely understand the storyline makes all that action and suspense completely ineffective and almost comical for unintentional reasons. Comical because there's no reason someone like me should be watching it.<br /><br />You're probably asking yourself "Why bother writing a review for a movie you didn't get?" and the reason is very simple. Let me explain.<br /><br />It would be completely ignorant for me to give Angels & Demons a low rating just because I wasn't able to understand any of it. However I believe it's important for me to write a review for those out there reading who might be leaning on the fence deciding whether to see this film or wondering whether it will just be a giant bundle of confusion. I can say with certainty- yes, it *will* be confusing.<br /><br />I can almost guarantee those who don't know the history of the Pope or his religion -nor those who keep themselves up to date with the Vatican City events- won't be able to grasp the storyline. Even in the film they say there's over 1 billion Catholics. That means there's 7 billion who aren't, which definitely increases the chances of more people not getting it compared to those who do.<br /><br />Obviously not all 7 billion people on the planet will have access to this film, but that's beside the point. Angels & Demons is designed for those who follow and get the plot, which is a minority.  The description did not warn me about this.<br /><br />As for Tom Hanks, his acting skills are right on the money like always. However I prefer the easily understandable storylines he's starred in over the years such as Forrest Gump or Castaway.<br /><br />You've been warned.</p></body></html>

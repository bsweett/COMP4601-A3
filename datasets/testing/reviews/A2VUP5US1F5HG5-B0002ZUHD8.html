<meta name="summary" content="THE REAL KING ARTHUR?"></head><body><p>King Arthur as Roman warlord?  It's possible, but as that plot device is handled in this movie, it doesn't necessarily make for the best story.  Gone are the courtly, courteous knights of Malory and Tennyson, replaced by a troop of surly, pagan horsemen with little to admire in them save their great fighting prowess and their unifying loyalty to Arthur.  Arthur himself is far and away the most charismatic figure, as it should be, and at least he is a Christian (though at times it seems he places as much faith in humanism as he does in God). Guinevere is introduced as a barbarian warrior-woman (and not a particularly likeable one either) and Merlin is reduced to a primitive shaman, but at least we still get Excalibur and the Round Table.  The chilly scenery and cinematography are breathtaking and the combat scenes are powerful, but this is not the legend's best version. Like MISTS OF AVALON and some other modern retellings, this movie succumbs to revisionist agendas that almost always fail (neo-paganism, feminism, etc) and while the result is by no means a failure, it is nonetheless highly disappointing.  Even the argument that this film's departures from legend are justified because this is *the way it really was* doesn't hold water because it's just not true.  For example, Lancelot is featured prominently in the movie (though there is no illicit romance between he and Guenevere) but Lancelot is one of the Arthurian characters who is not based on a real person--he is the fictional creation of French author Chretien de Troyes.  Be that as it may, the problem is not that changes in the legend are made (every storyteller will change the tale to reflect his own vision) but rather how those changes are handled.  Would it have been so hard to make the knights more likeable?  Or to portray Christians as something other than oppressive tyrants (except Arthur, who usually comes across very well)?  I don't think so.  In any event, the core of the legend remains more or less intact, and as an inspirational action movie about fighting for your freedom and never giving up on your ideals KING ARTHUR succeeds more often than it fails.  For Athurian fans I definitely think this film is worth seeing--just don't expect too much.  EXCALIBUR or CAMELOT this is not...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="solid performances by Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn"></head><body><p>Nicole Kidman (Dogville, The Hours, To Die For) plays Sylvia Broome, an Interpreter for the U.N. who over heard something up in the booth that she works in that may have been an assassination on the president of Matobo, Zubwanie. So, secret service agent Tobin Keller, played by Sean Penn (Mystic River, The Assassination Of Richard Nixon), whos wife just recently died, is on the verge of believing her and not. Nicely constructed action/thriller with some pretty good moments, one being a bus conversation and then it explodes. Also starring Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Full Frontal), Jesper Christopher and Michael Wright (Money Talks, Pinero). Probably one of the only good movies that has come out so far besides Sin City and Crash.</p></body></html>

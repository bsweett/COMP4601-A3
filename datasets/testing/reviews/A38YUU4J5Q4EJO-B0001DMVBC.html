<meta name="summary" content="No winners in this property battle."></head><body><p>I don't know how I let this  movie slip past me all this time, but I am glad I finally saw (and purchased) it.<br />The story is a battle over a house, that, in the beginning belongs to Cathy (Jennifer Connelly's character), and was passed on to her by her Father.<br /><br />A mistake in the system concerning a "buisness" tax causes her eviction.<br />She hires a Lawyer, but before she can reclaim her home, The County auctions  it to a Colonal Berani(Ben Kingsly)  and his Wife and Son.( A very decent and proud Iranian family)<br /><br />The entire story is about the battle that persists between the woman Cathy, and the new owners.I don't want to give too much of the movie away, but I will say that Connelly's and Kingsly's acting is SUPERB ! - There was one scene with Connelly in her car where she broke down, and her vulernability was heartbreaking.<br />Kingsleys character also touched me deeply when he so unashamedly laid out his soul in prayer for his Son in the Hospital waiting room.<br /><br />BOTH characters we see exposed, naked, and bleeding, and we FEEL that..we feel FOR them, and that is GREAT acting.Everyone in the movie did a wonderful and convincing job and really breathed LIFE into these characters.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting was that it was impossible to take "sides" in this because BOTH parties were right.( although in the beginning I did side with Connelly's character)<br />I do not understand why this masterpiece did not win any Oscars.<br />It surely deserved to.<br />This is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time.<br />The ending will shock you, and take your breath away!</p></body></html>

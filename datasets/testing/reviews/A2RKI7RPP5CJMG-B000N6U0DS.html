Up until his performance in "I, Robot," I couldn't see him for anything more than a goofy rapper-turned-actor who played characters based solely on the degree of their sarcasm and humor.  In "I, Robot," I began to see beyond the old Smith and came to see him as an adult who could pull off excellent roles.  With "The Pursuit of Happyness," Smith shows that he's matured even more.  Not once did I picture him as Carlton's cousin or the cocky flyboy from "Independence Day."  He has come full circle as an actor and deserves to be recognized for it.<br /><br />"Happyness" is based on the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who lost everything trying to do what's best for his family and eventually becoming a top stockbroker and businessman.  The viewer basically lives out the struggles of a man with not much more than street smarts and a high school diploma to get him, his girlfriend, and son through life.  Fed up with the life Gardner provides, his wife (Thandie Newton) leaves him and (reluctantly) their son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) for the greener pastures of New York.  Determined to make it in San Francisco, Gardner takes a non-paying internship with Dean Witter and has to rely on his dwindling and hard-to-sell stock of bone density scanners to put food on the table.  Needless to say, Gardner and his son face immense hardships, eventually being forced to live on the street, staying in a public bathroom and shelters in order to survive.<br /><br />The story's outcome is wonderful and heartwarming.  I'm not ashamed to say that this film made me cry.  It is a perfect realization of every father's greatest fear:  not being able to provide for his family.<br /><br />Kudos to Gardner for overcoming immense odds.  Kudos to Smith, his son, and the rest of the cast and crew who made "The Pursuit of Happyness" a stellar film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

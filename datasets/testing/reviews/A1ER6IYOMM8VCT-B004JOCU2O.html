'Unstoppable' is a very fast paced and fun ride, just keep in mind that there are some extremely ridiculous and unintentionally funny scenes. Slickly made with a likable cast, the film never rises above "edible garbage"(I know you love that term Andrew!:-D!). As long as you know what you're in for you'll have fun watching this silly action flick.</p></body></html>

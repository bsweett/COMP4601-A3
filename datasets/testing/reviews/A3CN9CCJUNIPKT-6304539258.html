<meta name="summary" content="Finally, the real (1977) version is back...!"></head><body><p>My fondest memory of "Star Wars" in 1977 was going to a special preview screening at a mall in Kansas City (nyah-nyah-nyah... I saw it before you did!) with some adult companions in tow... Opinion pollsters were crawling all over the mall, interviewing people about the film (and offering them a few bucks for their time!) and one of the guys I saw with, a hippie named Kirk, took the poll, got his silver dollar and told the guy that the special effects were amazing.  The thing was, we were still wandering around the mall, waiting for the second show... and hadn't seen the movie yet!  It didn't matter -- Kirk was just telling the guy what he wanted to hear... And besides, it was true: for the time, the special effects were great!<br /><br />Like many people of my generation, I saw "Star Wars" several times that summer (seven times, total, I think...) though I didn't geek out on the sequels and drifted away from the fold as I got older.  Still, I read about George Lucas's obstinant refusal to reissue the original '77 version with something close to revulsion.  So what if he's the film's creator?  Does that really give him the right to edit history, and to try and make people believe the first "Star Wars" film -- a watershed in global pop culture -- was something different than it really was?  And besides, wasn't a huge part of the charm of the series how darn rickety the first film was?  When I finally saw the altered (1997) "special edition," I was shocked at how clumsy and garish Lucas' digital updates were -- did he really think these were improvements?  Oh, well.  Nothing to get worked up about, I guess.<br /><br />I'm glad, though, that the original 1977 version is available again, and that modern viewers can see what the movie really looked like, more or less, back when it packed kids into the malls and moviehouses during the disco era.  Okay, maybe there are technical limitations and maybe Lucas is (inexplicably) feuding with his fan base, but at least having *some* unaltered version available is more intellectually honest (and historically valuable) than pretending that AVID decks, etc., were available all those decades ago.  It was a cheesy, exciting middlebrow action film: let's remember as it really was!</p></body></html>

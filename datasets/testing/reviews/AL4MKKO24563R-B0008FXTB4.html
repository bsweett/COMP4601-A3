<meta name="summary" content="Solid Sequel to Get Shorty"></head><body><p>The title Be Cool is ironic because the film isn't as cool as Get Shorty. Be Cool, unlike Get Shorty, takes a while to get going. But when it does, Be Cool is a very funny movie. Being a much bigger film fan than a fan of the music scene, I got more of the jokes in Get Shorty. Still, it's a worthy sequel.<br /><br />I do miss Rene Russo, Gene Hackman and Dennis Farina from the original. Russo is still sexy at 51. Hackman is one of the finest actors in film history, able to do comedy and drama equally well. And Farina always adds greatly to whatever project he's in. But Uma Thurman, Cedric the Entertainer and Harvey Keitel do an admirable job in essentially the same roles (Thurman's first scene, in a skimpy bikini, is sure to arouse any man with a pulse). Vince Vaughn is pretty funny as a white guy who thinks he's black although the routine gets tired by the end of the movie. And the late Robert Pastorelli, in his last role, is as funny as usual as a mob hitman who makes eating cole slaw one of the most nauseating experiences imaginable.<br /><br />However, The Rock steals the show from just about everyone as Vaughn's musclebound gay bodyguard. I didn't like The Scorpion King at all and wondered what all the hype regarding The Rock was about. After seeing Be Cool, I understand. The Rock hits all of the right notes in a role that is essentially self-satire, right down to the raised eyebrow. He creates a very likable character without becoming a buffoonish oaf. In fact, a couple of the biggest laughs in the film are The Rock's towards the end of the film.<br /><br />But of course, the film succeeds primarily because of John Travolta's ultra-cool reprise of Chilli Palmer. Played by a lesser actor, Palmer could come off as cocky and arrogant and immediately lose the audience's sympathy. However Travolta, as he did in Get Shorty, finds just the right tone to project Palmer confidence without sliding into arrogance. My only complaint is that Travolta is still smoking -- something you definitely don't need to do to be cool.<br /><br />Hopefully, in the next film, Chilli Palmer will take on the television industry. Reality shows alone will provide enough comic material to carry a movie.</p></body></html>

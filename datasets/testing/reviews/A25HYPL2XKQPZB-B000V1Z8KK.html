<meta name="summary" content="SHOOTER delivers! A great action movie"></head><body><p>Shooter, starring Mark Walberg, brings to life Bob Lee Swagger, a character featured in many great books by author Stephen Hunter.<br /><br />Shooter opens with Swagger and parnter Donnie Fenn on a mission in Etheopia. Fenn is killed and Swagger returns home to a life of solitude. Men in government need a sniper to help them prevent an attack on the president of the United States. Swagger is the man for the job. He's the best there is. Something goes wrong and soon Swagger is a wanted man being pursued by law enforcement every where, including the shadowy group that originally hired him.<br /><br />Swagger has no where to turn except to Sarah (Kate Mara), Fenn's widow. Michael Pena also stars as Nick Memphis, a rookie FBI agent who actually believes Swagger could be innocent. Danny Glover does a great job as the villian. He is menacing yet stupid enough to believe he is above the law.<br /><br />This is a good movie. The action is great, the acting is superb and the plot holds up. While the bad guys may be involved with politics, this movie doesn't make a political statement. It sticks to the thrills. This is a movie where you'll get what you pay for, a straight forward thriller.</p></body></html>

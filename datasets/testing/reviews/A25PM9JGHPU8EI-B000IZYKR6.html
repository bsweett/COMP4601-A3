<meta name="summary" content="Terrific performances, terrific dvd."></head><body><p>I remember seeing this at a film festival and being absolutely engrossed by the performances, especially Ellen Page who is totally amazing. Watch the film again and just watch her every second on screen. She is INCREDIBLE. What a PSYCHOPATH! This is a scary young girl to be sure, she could fool anyone with mesmerizing skill. The deception at the beginning featuring her youthful innocence leaves you shocked, unprepared to witness her true DEMONIC nature. I confess I crossed me legs in horror, it was so uncomfortably visceral. As for the film / dvd: the cinematography is razor-sharp and gorgeously blocked and lit. The widescreen composition is superb and the 2.40:1 aspect ratio is employed perfectly. There are two very good commentaries. It's particularly strange to hear Ellen and Patrick (who DOES look EXACTLY like S.Soderbergh early on) together given what happens between them!! The production documentary is insightful, including technical details, thoughts from the festival regarding sale to Lionsgate. This is an amazing effort, a very strong story and some of the greatest performances of the year. This is a film that will be remembered for many, many years to come. Excellent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An empty backpack..."></head><body><p>You know those films that think they are so smart; the ones that brow beat you with their `message' but wind up blowing a lot of hot air for nothing, because they don't even know how to make their message come across as anything truly substantial?<br /><br />`Up in the Air' is one of those films.<br /><br />The basic premise behind `Up in the Air' is that of Ryan Bingham, a loner of sorts who ruins peoples lives for a living.  He is hired out by cowardly bosses to fire their employees.  He spends his life segregated from society and works his hardest to avoid any form of commitment, going as far to do motivational speaking where he instructs others on how to remove commitment from their lives (empty the backpack).  When Bingham's company sets in motion a change that will ground Bingham (who travels around the US to fire people) and forces him to fire individuals via internet conference, he starts to panic.  His self centered tendencies kick in, in the guise of mock concern for the people on the other end, and he finds himself traveling with a young business woman who is pimping the new system in order to `show her how it's done' so-to-speak.  Add to this an intoxicating woman named Alex who is just like Ryan, and you have a recipe for a mid-life crisis.<br /><br />Sadly, this films immature construction and poorly explored themes results in a mediocre attempt to capitalize on potential.<br /><br />I have a lot of minor issues here that culminate into one gigantic problem; the film is just too shallow, despite it's overabundance of overbearing `points'.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman has a specific style to his direction that serves itself better suited for lighter fare and younger crowds.  His take on `Juno' in 2007 is an example of his talents better directed.  He created something fresh and sincere and in tone.  I even thought that his sarcastic touches on `Thank You For Smoking' were nicely placed and propelled the story (no matter how underdeveloped the film really was).  Sadly, his directorial approaches here are just out of place and distracting.  The film comes across like a poorly realized `television movie' thanks to the carefree effervescence he lends to each scene.  It is so airy and light and thus devoid of necessary weight.  The film seems to be trying to hard to be young, and it is not a `young' story.  The film also doesn't know how to make the most of the key scenes.  Take for instance Ryan's talk with his future brother-in-law.  It just seems so anticlimactic, especially for a scene that is designed to shed light on Ryan's personal shifts.  The script is just horrendously fleshed out.  The ending dives off the edge into an endless barrage of clich&eacute;s that try to (quickly) validate all the personality shifts in the central characters.  The endless finger pointing at Ryan's way of living was also a deterrent (not to mention that disgusting abuse of narration).  It was like Reitman thought his audience was too stupid to draw the right conclusion about Ryan's character and so he felt it necessary to remind us at every opportunity that his life was all about solidarity and that no one else around him (outside of Alex) understood him; thus he is abnormal.<br /><br />But of course he's not strange; he's just confused...right?<br /><br />The acting was a saving grace, although I'll never understand the praise and accolades heaped upon Anna Kendrick, who was fine but far from noteworthy.  George Clooney was charming and sincere and likable despite his unlikable tendencies.  In other words; he was very comfortable playing himself and it showed.  Whatever.  Vera Farmiga though, was a triumph and I'm so glad she was recognized by Oscar.  What she does with Alex is beyond words amazing.  She actually creates a character who is well rounded, understandable and three dimensional.  When her character is truly uncovered you sense all the layers of this woman stripping away and it is gloriously handled with a simple stare.  Farmiga is a master actress and I'm so glad that this film gave her the chance to make her name better known.<br /><br />In the end I'm struggling with this one.  I mean, the whole `we are poignant because our current economic state is a mess' angle just didn't do it for me.  The ending collection of `confessions of the unemployed' was embarrassingly unnecessary.  It just felt like a lazy `tag on'.  The film isn't that invested in the idea that our current state of affairs is that relevant to Ryan's story.  This is a story about a man-child who needs to grow up.  Just because he happens to fire people for a living doesn't make his situation any different than 90% of all the other man-children depicted in cinema today.<br /><br />Yes, we all need to realize that a job doesn't make us but it is the people who surround our lives that make us who we are.  I get that.  Watch `Days and Clouds' for a film that really understands the weight this economy has on a person.  For `Up in the Air', the economic crisis is just a gimmick to attract unwarranted attention.</p></body></html>

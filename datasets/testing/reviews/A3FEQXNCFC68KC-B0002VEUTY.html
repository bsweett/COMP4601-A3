<meta name="summary" content="A little different from the Theatrical release"></head><body><p>NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE UNRATED WIDESCREEN EDITION<br /><br />I won't spend much time on reviewing the movie itself as there are plenty here for you check out. I will do a review on the "director's cut" version and the DVD itself. In a nutshell COR is a combination of action sci-fi and classic serial science fiction (or "Comic Book" sci-fi if you prefer). In other words lots of cool action, fantastic sets, nice special effects, and decent plot development is on one side. On the other side you get cheesy names for locales and peoples (Crematoria, Hellion, The Elementals, The Necromongers), a few 2-dimensional characters, and a somewhat condensed story. This kind of content would do well in a longer run time (in spite of that being taboo in Hollywood). While it is a completely different kind of movie than the previous one, for those who loved Riddick in Pitch Black you will love him here too.<br /><br />Now for the special edition. To those of you who watched the theatrical version and complained about holes in the story a lot of them get filled in this edition. With 15 minutes of new footage lots of little loose ends get tied up and a new character is introduced. The new slant might seem a bit on the mystical side for some tastes, but I felt it appropriate. There are more than a few little things added to scenes to help flesh out development and I'm glad they did that.<br /><br />Probably the biggest change was the big fight scene at Crematoria. It now has more of it and the scene now has full audio sounds of guns blazing and bodies busted instead of just music like on the theatrical release. As much as I enjoy the additional footage I kinda liked the silence of the theatrical release better. What with just music playing and seeing all that mayhem it felt more dramatic and even artsy (in a "Ballet of Death" sort of way).<br /><br />They took out the "Back of the Bus" dialog in one scene, which i miss. Seems like they replaced it with a "sexy" scene that to me is a total waste of film. Don't ask me why they decided to put such a useless scene in (if you watch you'll know what I'm talking about). At least this is the only added footage that I recall that would have been better off in the deleted scenes section.<br /><br />While I won't say they fixed everything and now COR is the movie it should have been I do have to admit it felt much better watching the Unrated Edition as opposed to the Theatrical one. That might just be that I picked up more the third time around (yes I saw it twice in the theater), but then again maybe the new cut is just plain better. As for the "unrated" rating it's no big deal. More violence but still little to no blood and gore. Maybe a little more bad language, but it didn't seem like it. I guess it could be an R movie now, but it's a light R. If I was the one running the MPAA I would still call this a PG-13 movie.<br /><br />Quality-wise Twohy makes a comment on the introduction about how you might see noticeable fluctuations where they made the cuts for the new footage, but I didn't notice any. However I didn't see it on HDTV so maybe as you get to better quality TV's and bigger screen tv's you might notice it. DVD looks great and visually crisp with the audio being just as clear.<br /><br />The extras are pretty good, but I've seen better. Here's a breakdown:<br /><br />Audio Commentary - It's informative but not nearly as much as I had hoped. There is a fair amount of the crew just shooting the breeze comparitively speaking. No Vin commentary, which I would have liked to have heard since he apparently put a LOT of creative effort into this movie.<br /><br />Two menus - The exact same menu but with different art and stuff. An interesting diversion, but not a dealmaker.<br /><br />Toombs Log - Interesting, but doesn't really give you that much insight. As a primer for the movie don't bother, but as a little character development on Toombs' side it works well enough.<br /><br />Worlds or Riddick - The 360 degree view of some of the sets is not bad. The sets are pretty neat and it's nice to know they didn't go all CG like George Lucas and actually built some wonderful sets. Extra feature-wise? Again I say... I've seen better. The tiny featurette with Vin Diesel was the most informative and entertaining of this set. That little snippet should have been longer.<br /><br />Documentary - A pretty good documentary for its size. Definitely the most worthwhile extra on here. Again it would be nice if they made it longer.<br /><br />Deleted scenes - Some of these scenes are not only cool, but I feel would have really given more depth to the movie. Those few scenes I wish had stayed, but most are approprately taken out for whatever reason. Still as far as deleted scenes go most of them are pretty nice with only one lame duck scene that never should have gotten past the script that I recall.<br /><br />Virtual Guide - Practically useless if you are looking get more insight into the Riddick universe. Doesn't really tell you anything more than what you would find out in the movie anyway.<br /><br />Facts on Demand Viewing - Haven't tried it yet, but it sounds interesting. Will update when I learn more.<br /><br />Riddick X-Box game - Useless if you don't have an X-Box. No trailers or other teasers for non-X'ers to see.<br /><br />All in all if you liked Riddick in the theater you definitely should be getting this version. Forget the theatrical cut. There is more to love here. If you never seen Chronicles of Riddick and are a sci-fi fan of any kind I recommend renting this. If you like what you see you can always buy it later. Better yet go to one of those used DVD stores that apply credit from rental towards a purchase.</p></body></html>

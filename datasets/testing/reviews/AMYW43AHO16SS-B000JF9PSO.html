<meta name="summary" content="A powerful film for all to see!"></head><body><p>This is a powerful film!  The story is not sugarcoated with obsurd lines or Hollywood inuendo.  It was made as a real time docudrama.  We see the people who actually were there on 9/11; from the air traffic controllers to the military.  We see the chaos that engulfed everone that day.  The only ones who were not in this film were the people who perished on United Airlines flight 93.  What makes that element of the film work so well is that there are no known actors to play the passengers.  Director Paul Greengrass should be commended for not taking the high road.  It's a film that should be celebrated for the patriotic spirit of all Americans who fight tyrany in the face of evil.  A film for all to see!</p></body></html>

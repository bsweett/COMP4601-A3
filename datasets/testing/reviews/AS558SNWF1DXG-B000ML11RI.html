<meta name="summary" content="A labor of love for fans of the books (+one reader's regret)"></head><body><p>I'm a huge Frank Miller fan and when I first heard that "Sin City" was being made into a movie, I shuddered.  I could just imagine what Hollywood would do to it: cast it wrong, colorize it, water it down, change crucial plot points, sap it like "Howard the Duck."<br /><br />My spirits lifted when I learned it would be directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, though I wasn't sure what to make of the fact that so much of it would be digitally generated.<br /><br />In the end, it's hard to imagine another filmmaker making as seamless a print-to-screen adaptation as this.  The characters all look right, the panels were obviously used as storyboards, and Rodriguez brings just enough of his own spark to the direction to make it unique.<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot but at the same time, it left me feeling a little strange.  It's like seeing your favorite indie band suddenly catapaulted from obscurity to arena-sized stages, hearing your favorite obscure song become a Top Ten hit.<br /><br />It also made me wish there was a way I could've experienced it without having read the books first, because if you've read the books, you know almost every single thing that's going to happen when and how it's going to happen.  That's more a criticism of myself as a reader/viewer than it is of the artist or filmmakers. On the other hand, as close as the transition is, the material still unavoidably loses something when recreated in live action, just by the nature of the severity of the actions.  Miller's sharp images are paced as precisely as rifle reports and there's a strange difference between, say, seeing a drawing of Marv dragging a man behind his car and seeing several seconds of footage of Marv dragging a man behind his car.  Still, had I been given the choice between seeing an accurate adaptation and a bad adaptation, I definitely would've chosen this one.  This is what you'd call an accurate adaptation.</p></body></html>

Does he even have a high school diploma?  Or a GED?<br />Soime interesting facts, not opinions:<br /><br />The USA invented over half of the pharmaceuticals in use by the World today.<br /><br />Cuba does have Universal Health Care, universally bad,  look at the flies in the pitiful bathrooms that Moore does not show  you.<br /><br />England has universal health care, and a three day waiting period to get a tattoo.  Why?  Because getting a tattoo removed is a health care procedure.<br /><br />There is an often quoted figure of 47 million American don't have health insurance.  You know why?  A number of them are eligible for Title XIX ( Medicaid) but have not applied, yet.  Another group are illegal aliens from Central America.  They didn't say citizens of the United States, they said "Americans", which illegal aliens from Central and South America are, technically.<br />Remember "It depends on the what the meaning of "is" is?<br /><br />Not recommended for thinking adults and for those who don't want Michael Moore to make more millions.<br /><br />Gunner  June 2008</p></body></html>

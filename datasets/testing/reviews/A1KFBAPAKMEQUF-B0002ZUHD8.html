Exciting and intriguing. And most of all very romantic.  For me this is Knightley's best role -- love the concept of a strong, female warrior, although she starts off as a damsel in distress who needs to be rescued.  Even loved the cold-blooded Saxon king, absolutely lacking in mercy and a great villain.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the battle on the frozen lake. Wonderful shots of cracking ice, brave knights, Saxons falling beneath the ice.<br /><br />Not sure what all the belly aching is about.  The movie, like all others about King Arthur, is based on a LEGEND.  It's not a documentary, folks. Calm the hell down. And enjoy.</p></body></html>

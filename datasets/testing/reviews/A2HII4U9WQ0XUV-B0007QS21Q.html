The Stupidest movie ever Made."></head><body><p>Look: what you came to see was Will Smith, a typically competent actor who can do macho-hip-urban-cool in his sleep, and lots of shiny stuff exloding and breaking, right? You did *not* come to wrestle with the eternal soul-crushing dilemma of what, exactly, constitutes Artificial Intelligence, and whether or not it constitutes a Moral Evil to use creatures with feelings and 250 IQ points to clean our toilets and haul out our trash.<br /><br />Am I wrong? Well I tell you this, whatever the case: if you wanted shiny things getting broken with a side order of Will Smith, you got cheated. Check out "Independence Day" for that. And if you wanted to wrestle with the soul-searing, heart-warming problem of what to do with your local warm-fuzzy AI robot, then you should check out "Blade Runner".<br /><br />The point is this: "I, Robot" is cinematic carbon dioxide: it's odorless, colorless, and tasteless. In fact, it's riskless: it's so determined to be a staunch, dollar-earning blockbuster that it does absolutely nothing daring or terrifying. Did you know that good-guy robots wink at you to let you know everything is all right? No? Did you know that you can tell the Evil Wicked Robots from the Duddly-Do-Right Robots by the little chest lantern: Red means Evil, Blue means Good? You didn't? Did you ever expect that on a weekend you'd be watching Will Smith cowering at the top of a Chicago skyscraper while Evil Robots climb up the building ready to do him in?<br /><br />"I, Robot" is without a doubt the stupidest (and I use that word intentionally, because the movie merits it), most boring film I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through. It is amazing someone like the talented Alex Proyas (who helmed up the nifty "Dark City" and iconic "The Crow") had his hand in this slick, sleek, embarrassing and boring mess. It is positively sacrilegious that the great science-fiction luminary Isaac Asimov has his name affixed to this thing---if anything justified rising from the dead and eating brains, "I, Robot" is it. And it didn't have to be this way: even on a strictly action-movie level, Proyas manages to take some potentially cool scenes (the hulking, scary, highway robot transports) and completely ruin them (again, more robots jumping on a car...zzzzzz).<br /><br />The thing that annoys me most about the excremental "I, Robot" is that I now suspect the robot was winking at me because he knew I couldn't get my money back. The movie's original tag-line was "One Man Saw it Coming". If only I had.</p></body></html>

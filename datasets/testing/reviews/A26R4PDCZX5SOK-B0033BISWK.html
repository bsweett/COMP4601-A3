Believe it or not, I really had not seen any trailers nor clips from this movie. I was excited to see it just because it seemed like another Independance Day. So, I had no idea what to expect when it started. To summarize first, I was disappointed but still liked it enough to give 3 stars. The short version is a group of aliens come to the Earth and their mother ship gets stuck hanging above South Africa. This event happened many years ago and the aliens are now living in slum-like conditions in a prison camp. The style of this movie is to look like a news program or a documentary. Alot shot on video rather than film gives a crisp look. It seemed like a low budget film until you realize the high quality seamless special effects. So, I was not all that impressed with this movie and will give it a mildly positive recommendation. The blu-ray has some good behind the scenes materials that are helpful in understanding why the movie is as it is.</p></body></html>

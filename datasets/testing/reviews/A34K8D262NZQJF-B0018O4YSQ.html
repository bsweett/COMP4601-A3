<meta name="summary" content="Cool movie !"></head><body><p>This movie reminds me of the same city like landscape that the Matrix holds. I think the same cinematographer worked on both of those films but that's my opinion. This movie is really good and the story is worth watching the movie and finding out exactly what is wrong with the town. The main character is excellent at portraying his innocence when he is the one with the true power and starts unlocking deep secrets held in the most darkest places of the town. Cool movie and worth the pick up!</p></body></html>

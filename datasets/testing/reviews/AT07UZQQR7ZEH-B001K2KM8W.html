<meta name="summary" content="A wondrous and scary Spanish fantasy"></head><body><p>The first of two times I saw writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's Oscar-winning PAN'S LABYRINTH on DVD, it disappointed me because it wasn't at all what the critics led me to expect.  With its echoes of THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I thought the whole movie would take place in a dark and scary fantasy world with a young girl.  Actually, only half of the movie is dark fantasy.  The other half is real world Spain in 1944 with a sick mother named Carmen (Ariadne Gil) and a brutal Army Captain named Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  With the fabulous young Ivana Baquero as 12 year old heroine Ofelia, this film comes alive on a mandatory second viewing as a dark fantasy masterpiece, especially with immeasurable help from Del Toro's audio commentary on the Spanish Civil War and his film intentions.<br /><br />We have two worlds in PAN'S LABYRINTH:  the real world of Vidal and Carmen and a housekeeper named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) in a house.  And a scary fantasy world ruled over by the sympathetic Faun (Doug Jones and elaborate visual effects).  Linking the two worlds are Ofelia, a deep green forest with mossy trees, and an old mill with a whole fantasy universe beneath it.  But only Ofelia can see the fantasy world.  So the movie exists on parallel tracks with careful use of color in both worlds (blues-greens and oranges-browns--the movie won Oscars for Cinematography and Production Design and Makeup).  Faun promises to help Carmen get well if Ofelia will do three tasks (the concept of threes throughout is definitely deliberate).  The Brothers Grimm and Del Toro's own 2001 movie THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (which Leonard Maltin loved) are also sources as we start to wonder whether the fantasy world really exists, or is all a product of Ofelia's vivid imagination.<br /><br />Rent or buy the double disk of PAN'S LABYRINTH.  Besides a widescreen transfer and very insightful commentary on disk one with the movie, disk two has a Charlie Rose Show interview with Del Toro and two other great Mexican filmmakers, "The Power of Myth" featurette, prosthetic and visual effects, and the careful use of color and the concept of three objects/people throughout.  Disk two also has a Director's Notebook and storyboards and animated comic book plates for the fantasy characters.<br /><br />The film's ending is controversial; I find it quite haunting.  What if Ofelia herself does not exist or was swallowed up by fantasy creatures--a giant toad, fairies, a man with no face, the grotesque but sympathetic Faun--and can only be seen by people with vivid imaginations?  Del Toro also cites LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD as a filmic source and constantly mentions his own THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, which I guess I have to rent.  But give PAN'S LABYRINTH two viewings before you throw the DVD box across the room in frustration.  This is a filmmaker to study in depth.  And his newest film is a fascinating and wondrous--and sometimes very brutal--adult fairy tale fantasy that was also an Oscar nominee for Foreign Language Film.<br /><br />PAN'S LABYRINTH has been rated "R" for graphic violence and strong language.</p></body></html>

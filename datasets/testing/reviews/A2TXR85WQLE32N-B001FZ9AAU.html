<meta name="summary" content="The Man in the Iron Mask..."></head><body><p>2008's "Iron Man" is a very clever screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero.  Robert Downey Jr. is a surprisingly good Tony Starks, billionaire weapons inventor, who rediscovers his humanity while a prisoner of terrorists.  Gwenyth Paltrow is his beautiful and very capable personal assistant Pepper Potts, while a buff Jeff Bridges has a nicely dark role as his corporate deputy.  Terrance Howard is Starks' strait-laced military liaison.<br /><br />As the story opens, Starks is in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapon.  His convoy is ambushed, and the wounded Starks wakes up in a cave, a survivor of unorthodox heart surgery by another hostage. His captors demand that he build them a superweapon.  Starks instead builds an iron suit that will allow him to escape.  The jury-rigged suit lasts just long enough to get out of his captors' clutches, but the experience leaves him a changed man.<br /><br />Upon his return, Starks tells his deputy, and the press, that he will take Stark Industries out of the weapons business, then locks himself in his lab to build a better iron suit.  In an inpromptu visit to a charity event, Starks discovers that he has lost control of the company and that his weapons are being sold indiscriminately around the world.  Starks takes on his Iron Man personna to set things right, not realizing how ruthless his real enemies are.  In a climactic fight scene, Iron Man faces off with an unexpected foe in a copy of his own super suit.<br /><br />The Afghanistan sequences are tightly paced and suspenseful.  The leisurely intermediate scenes, as Starks perfects his Iron Man suit, feature high tech and high humor.  The suspense is back on for the finale, with an ending that begs for sequels.<br /><br />Downey is entirely convincing as the very human man inside an iron mask.  Paltrow isn't given a lot to do, and her budding romance with Starks gets little screen time.  The Iron Man franchise has been nicely updated.  The movie might have benefited from tighter editing; it does just avoid overwhelming the story with CGI effects.  "Iron Man" is highly recommended to viewers looking for an entertaining action movie.</p></body></html>

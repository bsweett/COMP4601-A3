<meta name="summary" content="The "Pulp Fiction" Of Comic Book Movies"></head><body><p>"Sin City", Robert Rodriguez's "translation" of Frank Miller's classic graphic novel series, is not a film for everyone. It's the type of film you either love or hate, no in between.<br /><br />"Sin City" is, in more ways than one, like "Pulp Fiction". Both films have oodles of violence, a large ensemble cast (even "PF'S own Bruce Willis has a role), and even Quentin Tarrentino himself directs a sequence. "Sin City" also uses "Pulp Fiction's" method of combining several different stories into one movie.<br /><br />The first story deals with grizzled veteran cop detective Hartigan (Willis), who is searching for little Nancy Callahan, an 11 year old girl who has been kidnapped by the sadistic son (Nick Stahl) of a corrupt senator (Powers Boothe). Hartigan manages to save little Nancy, but when his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) seemingly turns the table, it looks as if Hartigan is done for.<br /><br />The next story focuses on Marv (Mickey Rourke). Marv is a hardened ex con trying to go straight with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Carla Cugino). One night, he meets Goldie (Jaime King). Marv sees in Goldie the woman he always wanted, one who loves and understands him. However, that night, Goldie is murdered in Marv's bed. This was done naturally to frame Marv. Determined to clear his name, Marv is led through a wild maze to find who killed Goldie, seeking the help of her twin sister Wendy (King). He is led to Kevin (Elijah Wood in a role that will make you forget that this is the same guy who played Frodo), a sadistic cannibal who preys on prostitutes. He manages to defeat Kevin, but in order to protect the ones he loves, Marv is forced to turn himself in and give up his life.<br /><br />The next story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen), who has recently hooked up with hyperactive barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy). When Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) pays a little visit and roughs Shellie up, Dwight seeks revenge. He is led to Oldtown, where he runs into Gail (Rosario Dawson), an old flame and leader of a brigade of prostitutes. A shootout between the cops, Jackie Boy and his gang means a war between the cops and the mob in Oldtown. Determined to stop it before it happens, Dwight drives the bodies out to an abandoned tar pit. However, before he gets there, local crime boss Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) gets wind of this, and sends his men out to kill him. He is rescued by Miho (Devon Aoki), a prostitute who is also an amazing fighter. This concludes in a bloody shootout between the mob and the prostitutes, and makes for a truly exciting sequence.<br /><br />The fourth and final sequence ties in with the first chapter. Eight years after rescuing little Nancy (here played by Jessica Alba), Hartigan, who still keeps in touch of her, has decided to start his life over. But he soon learns that Roark's son, whom he thought he killed, has resurfaced, and is out to finish the job. He catches up with Nancy and is intent on saving her. This leads to a bang up finale between Willis and Stahl, and results in a chilling ending that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />To put in simple terms, "Sin City" is an excellent movie. It is one of the greatest comic book films ever created, and both the storyline and special effects work extremely well. This two disc special edition is loaded with bonus features and is a dvd that belongs in your collection.</p></body></html>

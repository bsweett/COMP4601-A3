<meta name="summary" content="Rootin'-Tootin' Cowboy Tale"></head><body><p>Kevin Costner directed and costars in this beautifully filmed saga of courageous cattle drivers menaced by a powerful rancher and his corrupt Marshall.  Cowhands Charley (Costner) and Boss (Robert Duvall) find themselves avenging a brutal murder against impossible odds.  A brave townswoman (Annette Benning) catches Charley's eye, but is it too late?  <p>Duvall and Costner are both sensational as the simple, hardworking cowboys who have a deep bond of friendship and respect. They are not idealized, but are shown to be two good men who live by a code of honor. The movie was filmed in spectacular Alberta, Canada.  <p>I was surprised by how much I liked "Open Range."  The heroes are likeable, the script is intelligent and satisfying, and the action-filled finale is a tour-de-force for director Costner.  The little touches, like filming through old, rippled window glass, are great.  The violence is not excessive, and the blend of action, suspense, humor, and even a little romance make for a very enjoyable film.</p></body></html>

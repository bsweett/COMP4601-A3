<meta name="summary" content="Suprisingly solid and effective little film!"></head><body><p>RED EYE is good, clean, solid, suspenseful fun.  It's a low-budget film that doesn't look it because it doesn't spend money on stuff it can't pull off.  Wes Craven has put together a solid-cast of up and coming young stars, and given them a chance to shine in a genre film that is far above the average for its ilk.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams (whose bandwagon I am not quite firmly on, after THE WEDDING CRASHERS and this film) and Cillian Murphy (great in 28 DAYS LATER and quite effective in BATMAN BEGINS) meet at the airport.  He is silkily charming with her, and she, while not "looking for love" is happy to spend a moment or two with him.  Then, when they discover they are seatmates, she is surprised at the coincidence, but happy enough to know her seatmate isn't some crazy old lady or overweight businessman.<br /><br />Nope, he's just a contract killer with a dash of psycho-killer thrown in.  Turns out he needs her to make a few calls to the hotel she manages to make sure that the visiting Secretary of Homeland Security is moved to a room that will make him vulnerable to assassination.  If she doesn't comply, her will order her beloved father murdered.  Oh, and of course, the clock is ticking and time is FAST running out.<br /><br />Upon reflection, it's a pretty silly scenario.  This is the BEST plan these A-1 killers could come up with??!!  But McAdams and Murphy are far too watchable to think about those things while watching the film.  That's what you want from a suspense film...to be able to suspend all disbelief and actually go along with the thrilling proceedings for 90 minutes or so.<br /><br />McAdams tries several tactics to thwart her tormentor.  Some might say she is a "spunky" character, but she has a bit more grit than that.  McAdams makes her very appealing and we root for her immediately...which is important...the film doesn't have time to slowly make us warm to her.  McAdams has a winning smile, intelligent eyes and isn't so outrageously attractive that we hold her at arms length.  Murphy has the important knack of making his eyes go empty of all emotion, which makes him instantly unlikeable.<br /><br />Brian Cox, one of the finest character actors around, plays the father and he's good in his little part as well.<br /><br />It doesn't sound like much of a film, does it?  But within its 80+ minutes, you get more heart-quickening moments that your average 2 hour thriller.  It's a small movie that makes the absolute most of its limited resources.  Wes Craven obviously hasn't lost all his skills as a filmmaker.  And he was SO lucky in that his two leads are fast emerging as popular favorites.<br /><br />Also, since it's PG-13, it's not bad for kids.  A few mild swear words are thrown out, but mostly the rating comes from the intensity of the sparring between these two.  I liked it a fair amount...it won't be remembered as an all-time great, but it's really one of this year's more pleasant surprises.</p></body></html>

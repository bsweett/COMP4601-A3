<meta name="summary" content="There is a Skynet... and it wrote this movie"></head><body><p>Who is this McG dude again? Oh right, he's some douche bag with a ridiculous moniker (McG??????) and has only directed a handful of movies and a couple rap videos. Yep, that's right, we have a guy with almost no experience in film directing a film in a franchise that's very easy to screw up: Terminator. And you know something's up when T3, which was also a piece of crap, starts looking like a good movie in comparison to the newest crappy entry in the series.<br /><br />Christian Bale is in this movie, which is unfortunately a missed opportunity as well. It's no wonder he had a meltdown on the set of this movie- nobody can blame him. This movie is pure muck. I saw this on opening weekend, and walked away as satisfied as much as I was when seeing "9" (in other words, not satisfied). Like I mentioned before, this is a very easy franchise to f--k up, and McG did just that.<br /><br />There's literally nothing to spoil in here. There's basically no plot except something about protecting the universe. The action scenes are very poorly done, with the shaky camera and quick cutting (WHEN WILL DIRECTORS STOP SHAKING THE GODDAMN CAMERA!!!!!!). I could hardly tell what was going on. The acting is awful- except for the excellent performance by Anton Yelchin, who is someone I don't usually like. But even he can't save the movie from sucking out loud. And Sam Worthington is a wasted opportunity here- he was AMAZING in Avatar, and horrible in this too... also, I'm a real Bonham-Carter fanboy, yet she even sucked in this too. The dialogue is terrible ("We have won the battle, but we haven't won the war"??? I think I heard that on an episode of Power Rangers). Yep, you guessed it, this movie sucks out loud.<br /><br />IN TOTAL<br />Violence: Headache/10<br />Sex: 0/10<br />McG: What an idiot/10<br /><br />***Approach with caution***</p></body></html>

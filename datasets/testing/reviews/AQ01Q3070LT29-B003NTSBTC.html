<meta name="summary" content="You can't leave Shutter Island"></head><body><p>it is 1954. A seasick man, Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) with his new partner Chuck Avle (Mark Ruffalo) are on a ferry to Boston Harbor islands. They are on their way to Shutter Island where a mental hospital for the criminally insane are held. The patients are dangerous. There is only one way in and one way out. Only one dock. At the gate of the institution, Deputy Marshall McPherson (John Carroll Lynch) tells them they are not allowed to have their firearms.<br />  Inside they are met by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). He proceeds to tell them that Rachel Solando is missing. The door to her room is kept locked.<br />  Her story is, she killed her three children in the lake behind her house and then sat them at the kitchen table and ate a meal. She still thinks her children are alive.<br />  Daniels and Avle begin their investigation.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Michelle Williams, Max Von Sydow, Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, Matthew Cowles.<br /><br />Option of Audio and Subtitles in English, French, Spanish.<br /><br />  I was hoping for a good film noir-mystery film, but this movie is all messed up.<br />The name "Martin Scorsese" should have told me something. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC18">Taxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a></p></body></html>

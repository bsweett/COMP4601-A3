And turning a hot tub into a time machine is pretty off-beat (can you imagine the pitch to the studio?  'Yeah, you've got a hot tub that turns into a time machine, with Chevy Chase!  Really!).<br /><br />Well, no.  The plot, such as it is, involves a group of guys who are trying to cheer themselves up by going to this formerly hot ski resort.  It was the best times of their lives, I guess.  Well, the resort has fallen on hard times.  It's pretty dismal, and even the surly bell hop has seen better times.<br /><br />I'm not sure the point of this film, except to make some money through a clever title and aiming for the 25-40 year old male crowd with a few topless pretty women (I guess).  The kid is kind of funny, and there is that recurring joke about the one-armed guy, but that's pretty much it.<br /><br />I did watch the whole thing, for some reason.  Sometimes you are just hoping a film will redeem itself.  I didn't have that hope for Time Machine; maybe I just wanted to do due diligence before I wrote a review.<br /><br />One-and-one-half stars for 'Hot Tub Time Machine'.  There's really not much reason to watch it.  Even the unrated version doesn't offer enough in the way of titillation to raise that rating even one-half star.<br /><br />Stay away, unless the only other thing on television is an infomercial.  And most of those will be more interesting.</p></body></html>

Children of Men, freely adapted from the novel by P.D. James, stars Clive Owen as Theo: a one-time activist that is coerced to transport the last fertile woman on the planet to safety; all the while outside forces attempt to use her for their own means, and the world as a whole seems to crumble around them.  Cuaron's filming techniques are what make Children of Men so good, as his vision puts the viewer right in the middle of the chaotic action sequences that follow.  Owen is great, while brief turns from Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Chiwetel Ejifor are small miracles as well, and the lacings of political and social commentary that abound, along with a hopeful light at the end of the tunnel, all combine to make Children of Men a memorable and spectacular film.  All in all, if you've missed out on Children of Men, you are doing yourself a great disservice, and you should definitely give the film a much deserved look.</p></body></html>

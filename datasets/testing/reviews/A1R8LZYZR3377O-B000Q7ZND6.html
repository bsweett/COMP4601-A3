I was bored to tears watching this. The makers must have been counting on the sound engineer to liven this thing up. Alot of swoops and loud annoying noises while everyones voice seems to be at a whisper or above(except for a few ridiculous shouts). Wow the angel Gabriel really made sense, and yes I'm being funny. Possibly some decent computer generated things, but its been done better before, or at least in a better film. A bunch of mish mosh with an even worst ending.</p></body></html>

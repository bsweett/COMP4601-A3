Even more rare is a movie about enemy soldiers being defeated by the home forces; American soldiers.  Amazingly, it took Clint Eastwood to make such a movie.  Released late in 2006 as a companion of the other Eastwood movie, Flags of our Fathers, this is one of the best war movies this decade.  Set entirely on the island of Iwo Jima, it examines the defense and conquest of this island by the US military in 1944 as seen from the eyes of the Japanese defenders.  The Japanese soldiers are played by Japanese actors; which is exemplary, and their on-screen dialogue is Japanese, another plus of authenticity.</p></body></html>

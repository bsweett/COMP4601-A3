<meta name="summary" content="Pick The Right Theatre To See This Film"></head><body><p>A new Coen Brothers film is always something to look forward to, even if what you are seeing is not these film-makers at their best. "No Country For Old Men" from a line from the poet William Butler Yeats-- adapted from a book by the same title by Cormac McCarthy-- is certainly one of their finest. From the opening  panoramic shots of the arid countryside to the excellent casting--to a person-- to the abrupt, existential ending, this movie delivers. Both Josh Brolin (Llewelyn Moss, the Vietnam veteran who discovers the drug money), and Jommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell, give rugged understated performances. Javier Bardem as Chigurh, the crazed mysterious henchman who kills for the delight of it, steals the show, however. An Iago type character, he is the epitome of evil. He kills when his own life is not in danger, if we assume that killing is justified if one's life as a hunter of other humans is in jeopardy.<br /><br />If you see this movie in a theatre, try to select one that shows art films. I made the mistake of seeing "No Country For Old Men" in one of those theatres, that run 25 or 30 movies at the same time, situated of course in the obligatory shopping mall. Although there was only a handful of people watching the movie when I saw it, they made up for scarce attendance by laughing through most of the movie as dark and serious as anything I'e seen lately. The couple behind me talked througout the entire film and expressed their surprise and displeasure at the ending. I'd like to see this one again but only when it is released on DVD.</p></body></html>

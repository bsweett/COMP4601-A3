As far as historical war/battle epics go this has surely got to be among the top 5 films ever.  At almost 3 hours long you'd be forgiven having squeaky bum syndrome but this is no ordinary film and I never even noticed the time as I was enthralled!  The sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sounded great on my system and the picture quality was good overall although it could have been better as tiny black spots remained on too many of the frames.  The special features are rather sparse as well although a decent making-of documentary is included in addition to 2 theatrical trailers.  Interesting indeed to see what the Blu-ray version will look like when it eventually comes out.<br /><br />It's hard not to like a film that allows us to root for the massive underdog as he proves that one man can make a difference and all that is needed is courage and desire that eventually overcomes treachery and wanton evil: "every man dies, not every man really lives."  Gibson is excellent as Wallace and was a deserving winner of the Best Director Oscar.<br /><br />No film library should be without this great film.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 5 Sep 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not allow me to do this separately, I'll have to append this here: the Sapphire Blu-ray release of this great film is certainly worth the upgrade from the standard dvd format that I reviewed above.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved and especially the special feature documentaries making this the definitive version of the film to view.  The only thing that would have made this perfect for me is if it was released as a digibook.  Other than that, this blu-ray release is certainly a step up over the dvd and is worthy of the double-dip.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></body></html>

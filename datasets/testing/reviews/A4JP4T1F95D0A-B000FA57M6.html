Overall it was a decent watch, especially when you put it up against other video game adaptations like Wing Commander.  While watching the film, I was really reminded of Resident Evil(the movie.  From the evil corporation, to the outbreak, to the marines coming in to save the day was pretty close.  Overall it was not as good as the Resident Evil movie.  The special effects were weak at times, and I didn't find any of the main characters to be overly likeable, so I couldn't get into the movie as much as I could.<br /><br />For fans of the video game, the storyline has nothing to do with any of the games, but they do use the first person shooting sequence for about 5 minutes or so.  This is worth a watch if you have a slow night and want lots of gun fights and monsters.</p></body></html>

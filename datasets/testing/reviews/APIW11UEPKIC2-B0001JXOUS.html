<meta name="summary" content="should give it a 2, but it was ok, and it could have been SOOOOO much better."></head><body><p>So I expected this movie to show us what japanese life is like, and I was really excited.  I am a huge samurai film fan, I don't like the super crazy ones, but am more of a kurasowa guy.<br /><br />But the biggest problem with this movie is AT LEAST 75% of the movie running time, it is showing tom cruise and then it cuts away to the next scene and theres tom cruise, then they hsho you a different angle of the shot, oh that's cool, now I have a better angle of tom cruise.  It was sickening.  It's not like he failed in this role, but they certainly should have focused on smoething else.  Another big problem for me was the emporer.  I think they found the person they liked as far as looks go, but this kid has no acting ability whatsoever.  They should have put in like a jet li, and he would have been better even not being in an action role.  And sorry for using jet as an example, but I can't think of a japanese equivilent.<br /><br />So the ending was nothing spectacular, but better than most scenes because they actually show other people besides tom, and i just don't like movies when the only time they focus on the side characters is when they die.<br /><br />This seemed like a mix of a japanese movie, american, and a mainland china prodution.  It even had a hint of the UK in it, but doesn't excel in any of these countries filmmaking areas whatsoever.<br /><br />So with a tad more action and some a better final scene, and an overhaul done to the story to showcase at least one other person besides tommy boy.<br /><br />It does have a couple of good action scenes and the production value is very high, just don't expect to see a real samurai movie.</p></body></html>

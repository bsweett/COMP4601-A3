I vaguely wondered why an actress of Meryl Streep's caliber would stoop to take such a silly role.<br /><br />Then one frozen day I made it out of my house to the library and picked up some DVD's to help me make it through the week.  After several sub-zero nights and frozen pipes I was in the mood for something that looked warm and sunny.  The picture on the cover of the DVD was ridiculous but at least they appeared to be dancing on a beach in front of blue water.<br /><br />Wow!  It didn't take long for the warmth in this film to melt my mid-winter depression.  I didn't see the stage version so I wasn't handicapped by making that comparison.  And I never liked ABBA so I didn't care if anyone mangled their songs.<br /><br />I admit that I had soured on Meryl Streep, after having been a major fan.  She seemed to have become so mannered and self conscious that I lost interest in her.  But here....another WOW!<br />This and her performance as Julia Child have reinstated her into my personal fan club.  She is just so filled with life!  If anyone is willing to suspend belief in the credibility of the script, and just go along with the sheer exuberance of the film, they can have a great time.<br /><br />True, there are lots of "flaws" for the serious film goer which is probaly why critics didn't like it.  Besides a silly story, the casting is somewhat strange, especially the three men.  Colin Firth, whom I adored in so many roles, is awkward and looks embarrased for most of the film.  But that is his character!  And I give him credit for putting himself in such an embarrasing position.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan is good as the aging cute guy who can't sing but gives it a try.  He is losing his looks but that's good for the role, too.  He's just a guy who made a mistake and has paid for it and now is getting another chance.  The Swedish fellow seemed well cast.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried was perfect as the prettiest little gumdrop of a girl you'd ever want to see in a movie.  She was more than a pretty face, too, she acted very well.  The scene where Streep prepares her for her wedding brought tears to my eyes.  Christine Baranski, an actress I never liked, was terrific here.  I loved the bit where she has an almost-romance with an adorable young Black barboy.  Julie Walters was terrific, too.  I was glad to see that each of them had a chance to shine.  The numbers with the three of them performing were wonderful!  So much energy, so much joy!<br /><br />I can see now why Streep and the rest chose to make this less-than-Oscar-worthy film---for the sheer fun of it!  It really comes across.  A really good time awaits anyone who can open up to sheer, mindless enjoyment.  Intellectual snobs better pass.</p></body></html>

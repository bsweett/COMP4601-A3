Mel Gibson is one of the few actors who could anchor this film with his star persona, but he can't save this film from its own false heart.  The scenes involving the wives of the soldiers, sitting around the coffee table and discussing racial equality, are borderline comic.  As an air force brat, I lived through these years and watched my father leave the house on many mornings -- and I watched my mother's galvanized terror and fear.  There is none of that here.  On the battlefield, the blood virtually never stops flowing, in ways that make you think that the director kept trying to find new, novel ways of making a body explode -- so much so that he actually lets blood drip onto the camera, which of course reminds you that you are watching a movie.  While I admire the man (Moore)behind Gibson's character, the simplistic way in which the Vietnam war and its participants are handled -- including an absurdly PC epilogue involving the Viet Cong leader and an American flag -- felt false at every turn.  It's a big, noisy war epic, signifying nothing.</p></body></html>

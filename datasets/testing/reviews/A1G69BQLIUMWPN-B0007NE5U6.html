And I was relunctant because I had not seen the first one and disliked the book. But alas I went and actually suprised myself--I liked this movie.<br /><br />I love Grant and Firth in other movies I had seen them in.  And usually love Zellwegger but something about her accent turned me off.  Once I started the movie I was extremely thankful that they gave an overview of the first movie so I didn't feel lost and I thought all the characters clicked well.  I also loved the fact that she had gained weight for the role and honestly she looked better--but she waddled.  Annoying.  She was hillarious as she reminded me of my friends and I in her quest for love.  Something always seems to go wrong.  Which turns into a good movie plot.<br /><br />I think that if you were relunctant to see this you may want to give it a try you might be suprised like I was.</p></body></html>

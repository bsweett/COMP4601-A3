Watch this film and find out. <p>It's a seductive lifestyle, but as Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) finds out, it's a life that requires you to screw your friends, destroy  your marriage, and live a lie.<p>And by the end of the film, even after  Henry is stuck in a nowheresville subdivision in the witness protection  program after losing it all, he STILL wants the mob life back.<p>It's the  power of amorality, brought into crystal clear focus by Martin  Scorsese.<p>Brilliant film, full of marvelous performances and wonderful  moments.</p></body></html>

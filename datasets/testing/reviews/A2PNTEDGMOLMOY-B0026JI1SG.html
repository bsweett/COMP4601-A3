<meta name="summary" content="Timeless characters elevate tale of redemption through the risky life of a boxer"></head><body><p>It would be so easy to dismiss "Million Dollar Baby" as a "boxing movie."  Clint Eastwood's movie revolves around three characters who are living life on the sidelines (two by choice, one by birth), and through the crucible of boxing and motivated by the iron will of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), they each learn to step back onto the field of play.<br /><br />A word of advice -- avoid any spoilers regarding plot twists, if at all possible!<br /><br />The movie's story, based on a short story by F.X. Toole, could have been the source of a cliched piece of tripe.  Frankie Dunn (Eastwood, never better) is a boxing trainer who runs one of those dead-end gyms that you drive by and wonder, when the heck are they going to knock that thing down?  Dunn has a world's worth of boxing knowledge in his head, but he's so afraid of overextending his boxers (based on a prior bad experience) that his top contenders leave him for people who will give them shots for world titles.  Poor, struggling, and estranged from his daughter, Dunn nevertheless seems comfortable with his hum-drum no-risk life.  His only enjoyment seems to come from tormenting his Catholic priest Father Horvak (Brian O'Bryne) with the "unanswerable" questions of Catholic dogma.<br /><br />Dunn's "partner" at the gym is his former boxer, Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman, who also narrates the film, and should narrate every film).  "Scraps" lives at the gym, cleaning up the place, helping out, and offering a cautionary tale through the obvious loss of vision in one eye.  Dunn and Scraps have worked out a friendship that is essentially based on mild banter and never challenging the other.<br /><br />That is changed with the arrival of Maggie, whose ambition is for Dunn to train her to champtionship form.  Dunn resists, claiming that he doesn't train "girls" (a word Dunn defensively uses with dripping sarcasm).  But Maggie, a self-proclaimed escapee from a lifetime of being trailer-trash, is one of those people who will not be denied.  Interestingly, most movies would have Dunn finally accept Maggie after seeing her shockingly k-o the top boxer in the gym.  But Dunn's reticence to train Maggie is based almost as much on his unwillingness to take a risk on her (and to risk a "girl's" health in the ring) rather than a real conviction that she's no good . . . and this is a barrier that Maggie's fierce determination will overcome.<br /><br />While this movie clearly revolves around boxing (and the boxing scenes all ring with authenticity, which is a testament to the actors), this movie isn't about boxing.  It's about three lost souls who each find something they need in each other.  Through Maggie's successes in the ring to the film's shattering conclusion, the movie wisely says very little and shows a heck of a lot.  I may have seen every movie Clint has ever made, and I'm not sure he's ever shown this much emotional depth before -- there are several moments where his lined, scarred face says more with a stare, or glance, or glare, than most actors could achieve with ten soliloquies.  Freeman is Freeman, which is high praise in and of itself.  Freeman and Eastwood have such astounding chemistry that one never questions their bonds, even though they never speak of such unmanly things.<br /><br />And then there's Ms. Swank as Maggie.  Yes, she won another Oscar for this movie, and yes, she deserved it.  She disappears into Maggie, who could have so easily been your typical "girl from the wrong side of the tracks." Instead, Maggie is given life, strength, and delicacy.  Not every young actress could go toe-to-toe with titans like Eastwood and Freeman and stand on her own, and yet Swank does so astoundingly well.  Also, for a truly gorgeous woman, Swank disappears into Maggie so well that after only a few minutes, you forget that you're looking at a beautiful movie star and only think that you're looking at little Maggie, who wants more than anything to be a boxer.<br /><br />A wonderful film, "Million Dollar Baby" deserves all the accolades it received.  The two-disc DVD set is fine, but I've watched the movie three times and still haven't made it to the extras -- the movie's just that good.</p></body></html>

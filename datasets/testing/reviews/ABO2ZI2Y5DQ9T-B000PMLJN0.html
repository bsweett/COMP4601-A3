<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 Stars) Reasonable, Old-Fashioned Horror from the Creators of "SAW""></head><body><p>James Wan, who made his name by directing the smash hit "Saw" back in 2004, comes back with another horror film. But "Dead Silence" (written by Leigh Whannell, script writer of the original "Saw" and co-writer of two sequels) looks more like homage to old horror movies. The film begins with an old black-and-white Universal logo; it doesn't rely on gores to scare, using atmospheric photography; and it certainly has no torture scenes. It looks as if James Wan really wants to distance himself from the hit franchise that gets more and more gory and violent.<br /><br />In fact "Dead Silence" has many elements that could be found in old-fashioned ghost stories: a weird "legend" in a small town, an old lady warning about the impending danger, a creepy ventriloquist's dummy delivered on the doorstep of a married couple and so on. The story is about one Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten), who must go back to his hometown and discover the truths about the dummy and its creator.<br /><br />Though "Dead Silence" offers some decent scares, its story is weak and characters boring, lacking something that really interests us. Moreover, characters including Jamie, the protagonist, go where they shouldn't go and do what they shouldn't do, missing every chance to understand what is going on. Donnie Wahlberg, as in the "Saw" sequels, again appears as a police detective who believes our hero is No. 1 murder suspect. The story mostly consists of a collection of clich&eacute;d ideas except perhaps the one at the concluding section, which may not be really necessary.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" shows the filmmakers wanted to do something different after the success of "Saw." The film is a reasonably entertaining take of traditional horror genre with several spooky sequences, but it also needs a better script with logics and rules.</p></body></html>

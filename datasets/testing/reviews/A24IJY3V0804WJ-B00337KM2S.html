He is away on the road for about 322 days of the year working for a company that is hired to tell people that they have lost their jobs and helping them with the transition. Such is his isolation that he does not believe in marriage or love and is becoming alienated from his family of siblings. He is also a motivational speaker who travels on various speaking engagements and goads people to consider what is important to them. Life is smooth for the solitary man. Until.....<br />He meets Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who is road warrior like him. They meet and both become attracted to each other. On the professional front, Bingham's company has just hired a grad school rookie who wants to embark on some cost cutting and do the work of firing people by teleconferencing. Ryan realizes that his dream of attaining a million frequent flier miles will be broken, so he takes this upstart Natalie on a cross country jaunt to teach her the ropes with the intention of showing her that firing people in person is better than through the internet. On this journey Ryan learns some important lessons about life, love and family<br />Jason Reitman directs this great film and I think this one is his best after Thank you for smoking and Juno. George Clooney is great, I loved him in the scene when he discovers Alex's true colors  and his advice to his to be brother in law on his sister's wedding day.<br />Vera Farmiga and Clooney have great chemistry together and they are ably supported by Anna Kendrick. I loved this movie and gave it four stars. 4/7/10</p></body></html>

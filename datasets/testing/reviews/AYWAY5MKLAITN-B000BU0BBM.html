The story bounces around, touching slightly, and wrongly, on several of the fairy tales that we all heard about. there were no moments of sheer excitement or raised bar. It was as low as filmmaking gets. Everything was out of order barely making comprehensive sense. It's jumbled. Even the jokes felt strained. It's not worth it. It really isn't worth it.</p></body></html>

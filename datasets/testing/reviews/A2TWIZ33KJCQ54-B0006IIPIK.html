<meta name="summary" content="WONDERFULLY PLEASANT SPECTACLE THAT BE JUST THE FIRST OF MANY SUCH FANTASY EPICS!"></head><body><p>EXPERIMENTAL FORMAT DELIVERS THINGS TO COME FOR MOVIE LOVERS,<br /><br />IN A FEW WORDS ----<br /><br />This is a grand but light-hearted spectacle that goes beyond the farthest digital marker and still manages to deliver a story worthy of the epic experimental form.<br /><br />WHAT'S "SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW" ALL ABOUT?:<br /><br />In 2 words -- limitless possibilities. We have a grand story that fully utilizes the enormous scope of this epic digital production. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law interact sensationally with sets that were literally never there. Unfortunately, they get tripped up and bogged down with a lot of mindless, out-of-place banter which gives the impression that there is poor chemistry between the two leads. Nevertheless, a new and exciting digital world has been created by the Conran brothers and they will be back with more for us to behold.<br /><br />This film sets up a very retro yet futuristic atmosphere, very much in the spirit of "Things To Come" which starred Raymond Massey [James Dean's father in East of Eden]. In Sky Captain, however, the universe that Raymond Massey could only hint at in "Things To Come" was actually constructed for us to see through the eyes of Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Naturally, our heros are fighting against all odds and the ticking clock to save the world. Fortunately, they have all the interesting and amazing gadgets they need to get the job done and amaze us in the process. Just like the sensational serials of the early television age, they offer everything we could want in a visual spectacle: Giant Evil Robots - Mad Scientists - Flying Aircraft Carriers - Fighter Planes that double as submarines - heroines with eyepatches - and some romance thrown in.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />I have the "Special Collector's Edition" - Widescreen. They also offer this edition in "Full-Screen" format, but you can't get both formats in the same set. Having seen the film in both formats, I can't imagine getting the full-screen edition as it does lessen the awe-inspiring impact and the enormous scope of the digital sets. It also tends to break up some of the scenes as this film was clearly meant to be seen in widescreen format.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, Spanish; Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround); Commentary by producer Jon Avent plus filmmaker Kerry Conran and the VFX crew; "Brave New World" featurette; "The Art of the World of Tomorrow" featurette; The original 6-minute short; Deleted Scene<br /><br />-----*- IF YOU LIKED THIS FILM ALSO CONSIDER SEEING --<br /><br />"The Incredibles", "Mars Attacks", "Superman: the Animated Series" (1940), "SUPERMAN - Mechanical Monsters" (1941), Dave Fleischer, "King of the Rocket Men" - Serial (1949), Fred Brannon.</p></body></html>

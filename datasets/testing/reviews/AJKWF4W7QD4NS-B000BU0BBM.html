<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>As much as I love Terry Gilliam, I'll admit that I didn't have very high hopes for his much maligned Brothers Grimm, which suffered from production delays, release date changes, and just overall trouble from the distributers and funders.  That aside, Gilliam still manages to craft a fast moving, whimsical, dark fairy tale featuring Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm respectively; two folklore collectors and con-men who end up becoming heroes investigating the disappearances of young girls in the creepy woods.  Soon enough, they team up with beautiful Angelika (300's Lena Headey) as they take on a horde of beasts and evil lurking in the forest.  Gilliam pulls out no stops as there are many nods and homages to classic Grimm fairy tales, including Monica Bellucci as the evil Queen for whom there is no fairer of them all, and the rest of the cast, including greats Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare, are excellent as well.  As for the CGI effects, I keep reading and hearing about how great many think they are, but in truth they are a mixed bag.  Some of them are very well done and look surprisingly real, but a few don't look as great as many are claiming.  That aside, Gilliam's taut direction and the fantastic set design alone are enough to make Brothers Grimm a memorable ride, and anyone having second thoughts about the quality of the film should check it out to see how surprisingly good it is.</p></body></html>

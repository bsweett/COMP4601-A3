<meta name="summary" content="Interesting costume design, existential story line"></head><body><p>This remastered Blu-Ray version was watched on a Panasonic 42" Plasma and BD35K player. PQ 4/5 and AQ 5/5.<br /><br />I had not seen this film in a few years and found the visuals, and overarching storyline refreshing. The costume design and visual look of the film was particularly interesting and offered stylistic elements not seen on film since. The creatures seemed reminiscent of the Dark Crystal, which is one of my favorite films, so it felt familiar in that sense.<br /><br />The characters were relatable, and the "perfect" being was particularly touching as a "messenger" of sorts, in communicating our inherent habit of destroying ourselves, which of course, is one of the central themes of the film. Though not preachy, this characters' innocense and emphasis on this theme recentered the film to the core concepts effectively. Despite the fact that the film is filled with visually interesting effects and sound design/effects, this allows the film to remain humanistic. Many science fiction films fail in this regard, instead becoming overshadowed with technological aspects and special effects, but the Fifth Element stays true to its underlying message of the need and appreciation for love and the importance of humanity.<br /><br />Overall, this film was entertaining and action packed. However, I didn't give it a 5, because it seemed to lag in parts and some of the acting was overdone, in a way, that was too distracting, for me. Still for its visual elemements and overall theme, it was one of the most interesting sci-fi flicks I've seen. Recommended.</p></body></html>

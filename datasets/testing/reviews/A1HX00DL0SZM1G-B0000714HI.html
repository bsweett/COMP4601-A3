<meta name="summary" content="Ouch, I guess my expectations were just a tad too high"></head><body><p>Let me preface this review by stating up front that I loved the two previous entries in the series. I went to the theater really wanting to love this movie just as much as its predecessors (really I did), but there is a problem with the new movie....it's got nothing new to offer...everything here has been done before, and better in other spy/superhero genre entries....<br />To tell you the truth the beginning of Austin Powers 3 is the best part of the movie.... but it went way down hill after that and the laughs from the audience I was sitting with turned to groans at some of the cheapest and unfunniest sight gags I have seen in ages and disgust as some of the vulgar humor that makes "Scary Movie 2" look like "Mary Poppins" It's tired, Dr. Evil even told a joke that I heard in high school and it wasn't funny back then.<br />MGM should slap New Line Cinema --- Austin Powers rips off, Live and Let Die","The Spy who Loved Me" and numerous moments from other James Bond movies... and the trailers for "Die Another Day" and "The Two Towers" (ie Lord of the Rings 2")<br />Go see it and judge for yourself, but for me this movie gets a thumbs way down....</p></body></html>

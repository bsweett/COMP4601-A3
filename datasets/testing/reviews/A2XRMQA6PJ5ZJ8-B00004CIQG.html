<meta name="summary" content="This movie has it all!  Realism, seriousness, and hilarity!"></head><body><p>....and great acting too!!<br />This movie has it all and does it all.  The acting is incredibly good.  The storyline is crisp and direct, and grabs your attention literally by the throat and never lets go.  The ending will do much more than rattle you.  It rocks!<p>A US Air Force general, on his own authority, has decided to order his planes to attack the old Soviet Union.  His notion is brutally simple:  he reasons that in order to prevent a devastating counterattack, the US will have no choice but to follow his lead and launch a full attack upon the Russian military.  Well, you know that that doesn't happen.  What does happen is pretty unforgettable.  By the way, this is not a "fail-safe" ripoff.  These are two very different movies and themes, albeit they share a single common idea--that "the bomb" might get out of control.<p>This movie has everything.  It manages to present a serious theme seriously, but the humor which punctuates this film like bullets is absolutely hysterically funny.  And if you don't think so, there is something wrong with the purity of your own bodily ... fluids.  (See the flick and you'll know what I mean.)<p>The sense of reality and authenticity of this Stanley Kubrick film is incredible.  When you are up with the B-52s, you KNOW that this is a real B-52. When US infantry goes into action, you KNOW it is the real thing.  This is another black-and-white flick that benefits from this medium.<p>This is a DVD that you'll want to own and watch many times.  It is unforgettable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Ghost Story"></head><body><p>Atmospheric, brooding, eerie - this movie is all that and more. "The Others" isn't filled with shocking emanations. Actual scares are few and far between. You'll realize the haunted nature of this house isolated on one of the Channel Islands just after World War II - more by soft, suggestive steps.<br /><br />When Nicole Kidman's character explains that her children are photosensitive and have to be shut away from all natural light - the scene is set for flickering candlelight and dark corners. But it isn't all these elements of the classic ghost story that make "The Others" memorable. It's the brilliant way it's all wrapped up.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of essential material on the separate "Extras" disc that comes with this Collector's Edition. The only feature I found to be really interesting is the mini-documentary about photosensitivity, a rare condition whose medical name is "Xeroderma Pigmentosum." A family that has a child living with the condition explains the lifestyle adjustments that they've made to accommodate the condition. One of the most helpful things they've done is to get their children in touch with other children who have the condition. They gather from all over periodically and have, not a day camp - but a night camp. They learn to appreciate the beauties of the night - as the characters in this outstanding movie must.</p></body></html>

Rogers is continually rejected for service until his determination is noted by scientist Stanley Tucci, working for the U.S. military and who sees in Rogers the perfect candidate for their new Super Soldier program, spearheaded in part by brilliant Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing none other than Tony "Iron Man" Stark's father).<br /><br />Rogers' transformation, though, at first applies mostly off the field of battle, with Captain America serving as a USO salesman for war bonds (there's a wonderful musical montage set to an original Alan Menken-David Zippel song). Much to the consternation of gruff colonel Tommy Lee Jones, Rogers eventually presses his way into service, saving an Allied troop from certain death at the hands of HYDRA, a Nazi off-shoot presided over by the evil Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Schmidt has not only been previously transformed by Tucci's doctor into the vile Red Skull, but has also corralled one of Odin's energy cubes and created a new destructive weapon that threatens the future of the entire world.<br /><br />"Captain America" does dial down the particulars of its war-time setting so as to not feel like too much of an "all-American" story, replacing any overt feelings of rah-rah patriotism with an overriding message that Rogers is a hero not because of his nationality so much as his courage and heart instead (as he tells Tucci's scientist at the beginning, Cap "doesn't want to kill anyone" but can't stand "bullies"). It's a decision that ultimately works, managing to make the picture more appealing to foreign markets while not turning the material into a completely toothless, "Politically Corrected" portrayal of the character either (a gambit that paid off with the movie having grossed $365 million worldwide, slightly more than half overseas).<br /><br />Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script confidently profiles Cap's dogged pursuit of the Skull with just a hint of romance (British newcomer Hayley Atwell is fetching as Peggy Carter), though supporting roles for the likes of Sebastian Stan (as Cap's sidekick Bucky) and Neal McDonough (one of the "Howling Commandos") come off as if they've been reduced in the editing room. Johnston's fondness for the material, though, is always evident, marked by crisply-edited action scenes that bring the vintage Marvel comics to life. Technically the movie is graced by an occasionally rousing Alan Silvestri score (his end credits "March" is just great) and cinematography by Shelly Johnson that was done no favors by the movie's 3-D exhibitions, which darkened an already limited visual pallet that overly accentuated green-screen.<br /><br />If there's one disappointment with "Captain America," it's that the film works so well, it's a letdown when the material moves into the present day for its inevitable "Avengers" set-up in its concluding moments - making one surmise that if there is a sequel, it's not going to involve the period setting and supporting characters from this exciting "Cap" to the year's super-hero efforts. (Perhaps some kind of time-travel device can send Steve back to the `40s?)<br /><br />Paramount brings "Captain America" to Blu-Ray and 3-D Blu-Ray this week in a number of different variants, including a limited-edition three-disc bundle. The 3-D for the movie is well-handled for the most part with depth-of-field effects, yet as I mentioned before, the cinematography is dulled even further from its standard appearance so I would recommend the 2-D version instead. The DTS MA soundtrack is dynamic throughout.<br /><br />Extras include five minutes of deleted scenes in HD with incomplete special effects that fans will find of interest, including a different introduction to the Howling Commandos and a longer ending. Seven Making Of featurettes give a slick, mostly promotional-type look behind the scenes while there's another brief, amusing "Marvel One Shot" with Special Agent Caulson (Clark Gregg) set in between this picture and "Thor." Rounding out the disc are trailers and a commentary track with Johnston, Shelly Johnson and editor Jeffrey Ford.</p></body></html>

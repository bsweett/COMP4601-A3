There is no mistaking the film-noir/action-adventure/sci-fi genres that this movie so firmly holds in its roots.  However, stylish visuals and computer animation alone cannot hold a movie up.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; Sky Captain is a decent movie, with great action and a sense of humor and fun.  It throws in many elements of old films and comes up with an interesting amalgamation of creative production value.  The story starts off somewhat normal; scientists are being abducted and Polly Perkins (Gwenith Paltrow), a brash and fearless reporter, is hot on the story.  As large robots attack New York City, the Sky Captain (Jude Law) is called in to defend the city.  Flying what looks like a Corsair fighter plane, he successfully runs off the robots but not before they have unearthed generators in the city.  As the story goes on, more pieces of the puzzle are put in place and the dangers become bigger and more menacing.  They discover that they must stop a mad scientist bent on a `New World of Tomorrow' domination scheme.<br /><br />The technology and sci-fi aspect get so wild there is a large amount of faith put in suspension of disbelief.  I personally thought the 40s era approach and perspective on some of the technology was fascinating.  They found such simple ways to do complicated things.  But if you have no love for that kind of far fetched technology (planes that can go underwater, flying mobile airstrips) then you may hate it quickly.<br /><br />The direction of the actors leaves a lot to be desired.  Despite the heavy hitters, Paltrow, Law and even Giovanni Rabisi, they obviously had a hard time trying to act in front of green screens (their parts were filmed against green screens first to have everything added later in the background with computer animation).  They do well in some parts but others they just seemed lost.  Overall they do well, considering what they are up against.<br /><br />The movie is still a sight to behold and surely others will follow the example.  Director Kerry Conran is living his own dream and does a fantastic job of pulling out one fantastic fantasy visual after another.  He obviously has a soft spot for the Wizard of Oz as well, which becomes very apparent, as the heroes get closer to the finale.</p></body></html>

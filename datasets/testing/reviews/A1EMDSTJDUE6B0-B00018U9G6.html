<meta name="summary" content="Great Tunes"></head><body><p>I really liked this movie, but I could not give it 5 stars, although I wanted to. Why not? Not up to a five-star standard, even though I really liked it personally. It had a good mix of music, humor, and emotion, but it just wasn't up to par.<p>The soundtrack is decent, especially if you are a Classic Rock lover like myself. Many references to AC/DC and some to other classic acts.<p>It seems like a watered down &quot;Sister Act 2&quot; -- in acting, in drama, in sound. Not bad, just not as good as it could have been.</p></body></html>

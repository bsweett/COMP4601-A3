I, on the contrary, thought that is was a fun ride with some great characters and awesome action scenes.<br /><br />The movie is kind of like X-Men even though I have to say that  preferred X-Men and X-2 over this. But, this could be compared to them because it has numerous heroes and not just one like in Spiderman or Batman. The movie has these heroes that gather: Alan Quartermain played by Sean Connery as a skilled hunter, the invisible man who is..invisible, Captain Nemo who's got some big swords and a BIG ship, Dorian Gray who's skilled and yes.. invincible, Dr. Jekyll/ Hyde who's at times skinny and punny and at times absolutely gigantic and monstruous, Tom Sawyer and Mina Harker, a vampire. So, now that the gang's all here, they've got to stop a madman.<br /><br />The movie's plot is simple but the movie has some awesome action scenes and good special effects. If you liked Hellboy, Spiderman and X-Men, I'm sure you'll like this, just not as much as the other superhero movies. It's definitely worth a rent.</p></body></html>

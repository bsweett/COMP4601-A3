<meta name="summary" content="A sleazy remake of "Real Men" (1987)"></head><body><p>Looks like Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) an out of work salesman is making a come back in Mexico City. He is celebrating at the bar. Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) is also in Mexico City to make a killing. It is Julian's birthday and he too goes to the bar to celebrate. Naturally the too shall meet. After a shaky greeting they exchange job information and become friends.<br /><br />The question is where does this friendship lead and what do we learn form it?"<br /><br />The title comes from a scene at a bullfight which is used as a metaphor.<br /><br />The story can be scene again in essence in the movie "Real Men" (1987) which contains a little S&M but not as sleazy as this version..</p></body></html>

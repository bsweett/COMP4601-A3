The $13 million budget meant that certain sacrifices had to be made, but the result is still a film of high quality.<br /><br />***Spoilers within***<br /><br />Black Swan is a psychological drama along the lines of Psycho, rather than a film about dance. Nina (Portman) is a ballet dancer who wants the leading role in a new adaptation of Swan Lake. The role consists of two elements; the white swan and the black swan. She's apparently the best candidate for the role and performs the white swan better than anyone, but is encouraged to abandon her self control in order to access the emotions needed to dance the black swan role. In order to do so, she toughens up mentally, becomes more assertive and confrontational and explores her sexuality.<br /><br />Like Mulholland Dr. and Fight Club, the line between what is real and what is imagined is not obvious on first viewing. Nina is a disturbed young woman who has trouble staying grounded in reality. She imagines terrible things and obsesses about winning the role. Her duality is gradually revealed throughout the film and will frighten some people who allow themselves to become fully involved with the story.<br /><br />I won't spoil things further, but Black Swan is an interesting tale of Nina's search for perfection in her art.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are superb. The camera is frequently used to follow the dancers on stage and puts the viewer among the action. It's quite breathtaking in places. The editing and digital manipulation both convince the audience that Portman is performing all of the moves a ballet dancer might make.<br /><br />Shot partially in 16mm and also digitally, Black Swan lacks the level of detail normally associated with a modern Blu-ray presentation. Many of the scenes are dark, while others are stylistic and intentionally soft. Heavy grain is present, but the look is very similar to the theatrical presentation. This is not a poor transfer; it's an accurate reproduction of the film's original look. Don't expect to be blown away. This isn't Avatar.<br /><br />Portman trained for 10 months to learn how to move like a dancer. She also dieted so that her body fit the part. She fully deserved her Oscar nod for this performance. The supporting cast is strong in all areas, with her mother (Hershey), and her closest rival for the part of the swan queen, Lily (Kunis) both doing good work.<br /><br />The special features offer interviews with Aronofsky, Portman, Hershey, Cassel and Ryder. There's a 49-minute featurette on how the film was made, including the music, cinematography and special effects. Well worth a look if you're a fan.<br /><br />Black Swan draws you into its world. If you let it happen, you will be affected emotionally. The score enhances the experience considerably and the whole package is pleasing. It was one of the best five films of 2010.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5</p></body></html>

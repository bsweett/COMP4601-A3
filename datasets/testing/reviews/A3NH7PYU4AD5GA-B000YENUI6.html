<meta name="summary" content="Viggo shines in exotic tribal rituals"></head><body><p>I liked this movie much better than Cronenberg's previous History of Violence.<br />Imagine: a German, a Frenchman, and a Dane (Mueller-Stahl, Cassel, Mortensen) are heading the London chapter of the Russian Mafia, or at least of a branch of it. (Can't claim that I know much about this company.)<br />What an odd tribe! What strange customs! And who could say that EEC doesn't work!<br />The plot is gripping (has been summarized by others here, no need to repeat), the characters are not entirely new (some similarities in Italy and the US perhaps?), maybe one could see a structural parallel to 'Road to Perdition' (i.e. Mueller-Stahl as Newman, Cassel as Craig, Mortensen as Hanks). But I won't say more so as not to give away the suspense. Just one hint: Jude Law is not in it.His position is taken by two no-name leathermen with crooked knives, who can't get the job done.<br />And yes, nearly forgot: Naomi Watts is also there, not a bad show.<br />I wonder how a Russian would see the movie. Any comments from a Russian reader here?<br />I did get an idea what a Russian audience would say. I watched the movie in a copy taken in a Russian cinema. Once in a while, the audience laughed. Two such laughing moments were particularly surprising. One was when a man gets a knife in his eye. Ok, that may count as funny in some places. The other one was when the Russian uncle of the Naomi character, played by a Pole (Jerzy Skolimowski), spoke Russian to one of the gangsters. That seems to have sounded hilarious.<br />But oddly, nobody laughed when the Dane or the Frenchman spoke Russian. That either means, that Viggo and Cassel did a great job at learning the language, or that they were beyond funny. Cross cultural communication never ceases to provide suprises.<br />P.S. after comments on the level of the spoken Russian I must acknowledge that the movie is a failure in some respects. It was not meant as a comedy, but turns out to be funny for Russian viewers. That's a serious dent in the splendor.</p></body></html>

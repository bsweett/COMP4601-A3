<meta name="summary" content="Strong acting,  nice twist."></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this movie, all of the actors and actresses did a fine job and the story line was really well played out. The love of the two main charecters seemed a bit rushed ,it should have been developed a bit more. The magician, Norton, really had some great illusions and tricks, the orange tree was incredible. Towards the end you begin to find out that he is not supernatural, but a genius at the top of his game. I thought the twist in the end was a bit telegraphed. Overall I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars it was an enjoyable 2 hours.</p></body></html>

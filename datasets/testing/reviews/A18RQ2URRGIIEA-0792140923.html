The endearing film follows the life of an educationally challenged man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) from the time of his childhood (played by Michael Conner Humphreys) until early middle age.  His mother (Sally Field) made sure that he would be treated just like everyone else so that he could take care of himself once she was gone.  In addition to his learning disability, Forrest was required to wear leg braces as a child that made him the target of ridicule from other children, except for one girl named Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall).  However, Forrest quickly discovered that his legs weren't that bad when he found an innate ability to run.  When Forrest decided to join the U.S. Army, he meets his two best friends: a fellow recruit named Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).  Bubba loved to talk about shrimp and Lt. Dan was raised to be a soldier.  Forrest's relationship with Jenny, as well as his relationships with Bubba and Lt. Dan, led Forrest down several unexpected paths that allowed him to meet several pivotal historical figures.<p>Tom Hanks' superb performance as the loveable Forrest Gump earned him his well-deserved second Oscar for Best Actor.  (He had previously won the Oscar for Best Actor for the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and has been nominated three other times.)  Robert Zemeckis also earned the Oscar for Best Director, and the film itself won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing.  Gary Sinise earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, in addition to six other Oscar nominations that included Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Sound.  Part of what &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; so endearing was Zemeckis' use of superimposing actors into actual, historical film footage.  This footage included the late Pres. John F. Kennedy, the late John Lennon, the late Pres. Richard M. Nixon, and the late former Alabama Gov. George Wallace to name a few.  (Robert Zemeckis used this same archival footage technique again in the 1997 film &quot;Contact&quot;.)  Other memorable characters in the film include school bus driver Dorothy Harris (Siobhan Fallon), Bubba's mother (Marlena Smalls), Abbie Hoffman (Richard D'Alessandro) and Forrest Gump Jr. (Haley Joel Osment).<p>Some of the many memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes, running with leg braces, running across the football field during practice, scenes at the University of Alabama, boot camp, Vietnam, D.C., NYC, the shrimping boat, running across America, and the scenes with Jenny (both as child and adult).  I regard &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as one of the best films ever made and rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's the kind of film that draws the viewer into its story and keeps the viewer engaged throughout its 142 minutes.  I highly recommend the DVD version of the film to everyone, and the second DVD is good with its various documentaries and other material.  Tom Hanks went on to star in many more memorable film roles, including his roles in &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cast Away&quot; (2000) to name a few.  Unfortunately, many of Gary Sinise's film roles that followed have been far less memorable.</p></body></html>

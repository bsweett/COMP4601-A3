<meta name="summary" content="Coppola's vision is the sweetest cake!"></head><body><p>Sophia Coppola is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors for her style is one all her own, and one that is so unique and revolutionary that it cowers over most directors today. With her third film Sophia brought us a modern twist on the true life story of the Austrian born Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. Shedding almost a comedic light on this heartbreaking story Sophia was able the deliver a once in a lifetime film, a grand spectacle of entertainment that is bound to be this years `Moulin Rouge', a film to be loved or hated...there's no in between. I, as you can tell, am a lover not a hater.<br /><br />As Marie, Dunst is at her grandest, embodying her character mind body and soul. When we are first introduced to Marie she is fourteen years of age and being given away in marriage to the heir to the French throne, Louis XVI (Schwartzman), in order to establish an allied bond between Austria and France. Dunst gives us the emotions, not of an adult in her situation but of a young girl, intrigued and excited about her current situation as well as confused and alarmed by what she doesn't know. The whole scene where she is to lose everything Austrian, including her beloved dog, says it all. Marie soon learns to adjust to the ways of her new people, the strange customs, the constant back-biting and gossiping, the cake, the parties, the shoes...but the one thing she's unable to grow accustom to is her husbands complete lack of interest in her. Under constant pressure from her new country, as well as her mother, to produce an heir to solidify the union of the two country's Marie is constantly haunted and distressed by her inability to do so.<br /><br />Marie seems to immerse herself in the parties and gambling and trips to Paris in order to forget her state but it eventually causes her to fall out of favor with the country as a whole that in turn blame her for the nation's debt and insist on her execution. As the now Queen of France she became known as the Scapegoat Queen. She was beheaded in order to appease the country who blamed her for their current situation, wherefore the film subtly sheds light on the fact that there where other reasons for the country's current lack of funds.<br /><br />`Marie Antoinette' though focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and not the tragedy that befell her. In fact the film ends before her historical beheading but instead opts to end right as the country turns its back on her. This is symbolized first by their refusal to clap along with her (in the beginning of the film we see that it's not customary to clap after a opera but Marie, who feels they deserve it, convinces the crowd to clap), and then confirmed when they crowd outside her residence with pitchforks and torches chanting for her execution. The film plays out more like a fairy tale, giving us the Paris Hilton of the royal courts, with extravagant hair and of course a lap dog.<br /><br />One downfall or I guess I should say pet peeve was the fact that the cast was so extensive yet so under used. Other than Kirsten Dunst the cast barely spoke and the characters where barely examined or explained. That just further goes to show what the main objective of this film was to do. It's here to let us know the woman, not the situation. Actors like Danny Huston and Asia Argento get brief screen time, and then supporting players like Judy Davis and Jason Schwartzman barely stand out in comparison to Dunst's riveting performance. Jason plays France's new king with such inexperience and dread that you almost feel bad for his character...he comes across like a little boy. The scene where he's being convinced to help the American armies just goes to show his lack of experience and almost lack of interest in his new responsibilities.<br /><br />As a whole I was very impressed with this film. Sophia was able to harness what makes her such a brilliant director and deliver to us a one of a kind biopic that has never been done before and in that sense has never been accomplished to wonderfully. Dunst delivers one of her finest performances to date (Sophia definitely brings out the best in Dunst for her performance in `Virgin Suicides' was a definite Oscar snub) and will hopefully become this years Knightly for her performance was enough parts humor, enough parts drama and ample parts charm to at least get her in the runnings for an Oscar nomination. Love it or hate it, `Marie Antoinette' is a one of a kind film that supports a revolutionary vision and serves us entertainment as sweet as pie...err cake.</p></body></html>

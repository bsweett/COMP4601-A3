<meta name="summary" content="Lucky Jack Aubrey Comes to Life"></head><body><p>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is the magnificent movie dramatization of the characters of Patrick O'Brian's Naval novels.<br /><br />Set in the Napoleonic Wars, the storyline is built around the pursuit by British Royal Navy Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey and his ship, HMS Surprise, of the French warship "Acheron".  The pursuit begins with an encounter in the South Atlantic in which the smaller Surprise comes off second best but survives.  Aubrey decides to repair his ship at sea and pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and into the South Pacific.  The ship and crew will enjoy a brief visit to the stunning Galapagos before returning to the hunt.  The climax of the movie is the second confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is pitch-perfect as Jack Aubrey, firm but fair master and commander.  Paul Bettany is equally perfect as the ship's doctor and the commander's best friend, who will try to mitigate the effects on the crew of Aubrey's obcessive pursuit of the Acheron halfway around the world.<br /><br />The movie is rich in period detail and provides a fascinating glimpse into life aboard a British warship, crewed by tough sailors and officered by a interesting collection of sometimes desperately young officers.  The sequences at sea, whether rounding the Horn in horrendous weather or boarding an enemy vessel, are thrilling and well-executed.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a thrilling drama and as a glimpse into the British Royal Navy at what was arguably its peak as the best navy in the world.</p></body></html>

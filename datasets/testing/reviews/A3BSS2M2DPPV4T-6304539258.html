<meta name="summary" content="A MEGAHIT"></head><body><p>A young hero, a captured princess, a hot-shot pilot, cute robots, a vile villain and a heroic and mystrerious Jedi knight blend together with marvelous special effects in a fantasy tale about rebel forces engaged in a life or death struggle with the tyrannical leaders of the Galactic Empire. One of the biggest blockbusters of all time, this movie set a new cinematic standard for realistic special effects; making many pre-STAR WARS effects seem almost laughable in retrospect.</p></body></html>

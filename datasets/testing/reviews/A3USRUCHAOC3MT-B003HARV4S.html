<meta name="summary" content="What You Get When You Cross "Robin Hood" With "The Sting""></head><body><p>If you want an escape from reality that is enjoyable and mentally stimulating, you're looking at the right video.<br /><br />The setting dealing with turn-of-the-century illusionists lead to the inevitable comparison between this and "The Prestige." Aside from that, it's like comparing apples with oranges, Moby Dick with Jaws, fruit salad with a hot fudge sundae. These two movies have two different purposes and two different world views. Both succeeded equally well at what they aimed at accomplishing.<br /><br />I recently read "Saving Leonardo" by Nancy Pearcey, where she follows two differing philosophical trends: the Enlightenment tradition and the Romanitic tradition. "The Illusionist" fits clearly into the Romantic setting. The rational explanation of what is going on is not important. The protagonist left the explanation for a trick for the antagoist (a superb job by Paul Giamiati), but the audience never knows how plausible that is. Some of the effects in fact cross into the spiritual/magical realm.<br /><br />The philosophy also reveals itself in the story telling. This movie has a very identifiable hero, villain, love-interest, and antagonist. The purpose of this movie is to be an old-fashioned romantic story, without any real agenda than being an enjoyable couple of hours. The only complaints is that this reflects a modern view of morality, where there's no problem with the hero having sex with the love interest without being married to her, as well as some occultish tones.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is much more realistic than the "Illusionist", and I personally consider it to be the better movie. It made you think more. It also was darker and more depressing. "The Illusionist" was more enjoyable.</p></body></html>

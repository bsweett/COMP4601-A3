<meta name="summary" content="Fun Journey - Really a Kids Movie"></head><body><p>I wanted to see this flick because I liked the original Journey to the Center of the Earth with Jame Mason and Pat Boone.  That movie was a real long journey, mostly on foot and still captured the imagination.<br /><br />What this movie did was made the story into more of fascinating joy ride.  It gave you thrill ride sensation, like you were at an amuzement park or at a theme park.  The movie had some fun scenes that must have been great in 3D.  I liked the roller coaster ride that was created from the mine shaft train, a little Indiana Jonesish, but still fun.  The dino scene was a little silly, but still fun.  The falling scenes were also pretty good.  Although the humor was campy, there were definately a few laughs.<br /><br />Fraser is a rather nice guy geologist who is down on his luck, his brother went missing over ten years ago and Fraser is attempting to keep his work going.  His nephew is sent to spend a short vacation with him and Fraser is given his brothers things that eventually open the door to going on the journey.  Cool were the older copies of Jules Vernes actual book.  I remembered some of those from grammar school.<br /><br />There is the usual troubled teen issue at the beginning and he grows from his bonding experience with his uncle.  So we have a good story, good comedy, great action and effects, but, it was still a bit light.  I wish they would have had Pat Boone show up in the flick for a cameo giving us a connection with the old movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the scenes in Iceland and Italy, and of course, the Center of the Earth.  Good for a laugh or for a light evening of got nothing better to do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Minority Report  (2002)"></head><body><p>Director:  Steven Spielberg<br />Cast:  Tom Cruise, Max Von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton.<br />Running Time:  140 minutes.<br />Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.<p>Steven Spielberg is perhaps the only director in the history of film who has the ability to extract almost every human emotion in all of his films, whether its true terror ("Jaws"), utter anguish and despair ("Schindler's List"), absolute awe ("Jurassic Park", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"), pride ("Saving Private Ryan"), laughter ("Hook"), and love ("E.T.").  "Minority Report" is a film that promotes suspicion, and more importantly, how greed can deteriorate the soul.<p>In the year 2054, Tom Cruise stars as a prominent law enforcement agent who has the uncanny ability to envision murders and crimes before they are committed.  Because of agents such as Cruise, the criminal justice system is impeccable and without failure, saving lives and putting those who endanger others into jail.  With the tragic loss of his lover (Samantha Morton), John Anderton (Cruise) feels as though life can get no worse; until he becomes the subject of a pre-cognitive murder that he did not commit.  With an FBI agent (Colin Farrell) only a step behind him, Anderton must come to realize why he has been framed, how he has become a suspect, and who the real killer is.<p>Cruise is dynamite as the heroic officer of "PreCrime", jumping from flying, hovering aircrafts (yes, it is 2004 for crying out loud) and blending a poignant, confounded ingredient to his character that not many others would have pulled off.  Spielberg delivers his most authoritative picture since "Saving Private Ryan", enchanting the audience using superb special effects and a cerebral screenplay based off Philip K. Dick's brilliant short story.  The film can often be superiorly confusing for those who do not follow all of the technological jargon, which may throw many viewers off.  With that shoved aside, this latest Spielberg effort has a little bit of everything.  Not a classic, but not a small, futuristic, step from it.</p></body></html>

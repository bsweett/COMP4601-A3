<meta name="summary" content="One of the best recent Horror films."></head><body><p>Amityville Horror is like your usual haunted house movie. A happy couple moves into a new house. Despite strange happenings going on in the house, they stay there anyway. Well mostly since Reynolds' starts going nuts and won't admit anything is going on in the house. Sure you could knock this movie but compared to other more recent horror movies, it's not that bad.<br /><br />  It's certainly better than most movies that don't get released for critics. It's even better than most horror movies that do get released for critics. Funny man Ryan Reynolds is actually scary here and shows that he can do more than just bad raunchy comedies. Alias Season 3 star Melissa George isn't bad either as Reynolds' wife. The movie can have it's silly moments but it's scary enough to hold your attention. It offers tons of freaky images as well. It's a little too short and doesn't develop the characters that well but it's still scarier than Boogieman, Darkness and the Ring 2. So is worth checking out.</p></body></html>

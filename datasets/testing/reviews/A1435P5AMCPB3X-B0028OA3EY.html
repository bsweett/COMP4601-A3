<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, right at the caliber where the old left off"></head><body><p>This film fits right into the series of sequals in the superman films.  I must give it at least a four star review due to the use of a non-major star for superman, and kevin spacey's performance, but the overall movie seemed to drag at some spots, and really was really almost to easilly follow, not much surprise. However, when there was action, the screen was always busy, kept me interested.  The situations are classic "superman" situations with mass destruction and displays of unhuman strength.  Overall though, I was left with a feeling like there just should have been more.  There will likely be a sequel, we'll all just have to wait and see. Rent this movie, or buy it for a discount price, but likely not worth spending more than the single disc price for.</p></body></html>

Throughout the movie we learn about the life of a devout Muslim Sudanese/American man that seems to have a conflicted past. We know his father was killed by a terrorist and he had some military training. We think he may have worked for the CIA. The question is what is he up to now and who is he really working for presently? He seems to be helping a terrorist group plan a major offensive against the United States. This is an excellent thriller well worth at least a rental and probable a buy because of the story, acting, and quality of the production. Excellent quality DVD with some extras. If you enjoyed this catch "Spy Game".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

But believe me when I tell you that this film is much more than just that. This is a story about fighting against the odds, even when you are down on your luck and it seems that there is nowhere to go. The real story of Jim Braddock shows us how this boxer could bring hope to thousands, who were ready to give up at the time of the Great Depression. And in the process, we get to know a little more about the man, his family and friends, and what it meant to live through the toughest economic crises the United States has ever experienced.<br /><br />Jim Braddock had everything going for him. It was the year 1928 and he was winning fights and becoming a serious contender for the light heavyweight championship. He had a beautiful wife, three kids, a nice house, and an agent / friend who supported him through every step. What more could he ask for? But then everything came tumbling down. He lost an important fight, suffered a series of injuries, and the market crashed, leaving him penniless. In 1933, we find him living in a one room apartment with his wife and kids, not able to pay the bills and begging for work at the docks, along with many others. He is still trying to make some money fighting, but when he breaks his hand and as a result disappoints the organizer of the bout, his license is revoked.<br /><br />When the situation becomes untenable, Jim has to swallow his pride and accept welfare. But that is not enough, so he has to go and beg to his old friends. And then, when he least expects it, opportunity knocks. The opponent of the number two contender for the title withdrew at the last moment and the organizers need a "punching bag" because the show must go on. Even though Jimmy has not trained in a while, he gladly accepts, and tired and hungry shows up for the fight. The rest...is history!<br /><br />I had some knowledge about the career of this boxer, but I had no information about his life. This movie provides a great look at the human being beyond the athlete. And what a great guy we find! Someone who has a iron will, who will do anything for his family as long as it is moral, and who provides a great example of what a father should be like. Russell Crowe becomes Jim Braddock, and does so in such a convincing way that it is almost uncanny. I am amazed by how much effort this actor puts into altering his physique to fit the character he is playing. He lost a pretty significant amount of weight to look like a fit boxer, and he even looks younger as a result.<br /><br />Rennee Zellweger plays the role of Jim's wife, and she does so with passion and commitment. Also, the actor that delighted us in "Sideways", Paul Giamatti, delivers a praiseworthy performance, even though he has a secondary role. His calm demeanor in this movie is almost funny to watch. Besides the great acting and the wonderful story of Braddock's life, the film counts with excellent settings and costumes that help reenact the period perfectly.<br /><br />This movie has taken the spot of my favorite drama with a sport's theme, and I cannot recommend it high enough!</p></body></html>

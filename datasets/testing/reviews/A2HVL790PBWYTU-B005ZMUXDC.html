It's interesting to note that Mother Gothel, for a witch, doesn't really exhibit much magical mojo. Instead she manipulates people by applying that vile eldritch technique popularly known as psychology. To me, this makes her more memorable. I think guilt trips and ego tilting are more deadly than dragons and ogres.<br /><br />"Once upon a time a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens. And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured." It's how the fairy tale begins. Except that Mother Gothel, selfish witch, got to it first and proceeded to harvest the petals to rejuvenate her youth. When the Queen of the land falls ill during her pregnancy, a desperate search unearths the golden flower. The Queen's health improves dramatically and she gives birth to a baby daughter whose hair unfurls long and golden and imbued with the enchanted flower's properties. Mother Gothel, an opportunist, promptly steals away with the baby. So it happens that, each year after, on their vanished child's birthday, the king and queen and all in the kingdom loose thousands of floating lantern lights into the night sky in hopes that they would guide the lost princess back home. Crazy thing, many years would elapse, but this far-fetched, wistful plan actually will work.<br /><br />In a remote forest, confined in a hidden tower, Rapunzel gazes out each day, dreaming big dreams, open to adventure, longing to see the world. Obedient child that she is, Rapunzel heeds her mother's behest that she not venture outside, the world being too perilous for the likes of her. For years Rapunzel has made the best of it, carving out her own little world but marveling, always marveling, at the mysterious floating lights which emerge each year on her birthday. On her eighteenth birthday, her hope is that her mother will at last allow her a measure of freedom. It's cramped in that tower, what with her 70-foot-long tresses taking up a lot of room. Her hair has never been cut, lest it loses its uncanny properties.<br /><br />"Flower, gleam and glow, let your power shine. Make the clock reverse. Bring back what once was mine... what once was mine." It's what her mother, Mother Gothel, croons to her whenever she visits Rapunzel at the tower, combing her hair. It doesn't enter Rapunzel's thoughts that Mother Gothel fosters ulterior motives. Why would she? But there's a rebellious streak in Rapunzel. And when the dashing (but vain) bandit Eugene Fritzherbert - er, Flynn Rider stumbles onto her tower, she seizes this opportunity to embark on a forbidden road trip, with Flynn Rider serving as her guide. She hopes to track down the source of those floating lights.<br /><br />Disney did us a solid by trotting out TANGLED for its milestone 50th animated film. This is an instant classic, a top notch animated tale with something for the kids and the grown-ups. I think I'm past the stage of going gaga over Disney or Pixar's animated virtuosity. Nowadays, I expect it. Still, the fabulous scene in which our leads are on a boat watching the rise of the lantern lights is one of the most moving and spectacular moments Disney has ever produced. And you have to laud the work that the animators put into making Rapunzel's expressive hair come to life. The laughs come plenty, with Rapunzel's animal friends predictably delivering much of the humor, although Zachary Levi, who voices Flynn Rider, occasionally contributes an arch one-liner, including the bit about the smolder. Broadway vet Donna Murphy is very good as Mother Gothel who alternates from faux cheeriness to openly manipulative. Another fun character is Maximus, the proud and tenacious Royal Guard's stallion. You have to admire how this dedicated steed goes above and beyond to apprehend the wanted Flynn Rider. There's also a shy chameleon lizard who tries to look after Rapunzel.<br /><br />Mandy Moore anchors the movie. She's tremendous in inhabiting the role of Rapunzel; her voice is ideally suited to playing a high-spirited and inquisitive Disney princess (a princess who swings a mean frying pan). I'm probably dissing Mandy Moore's live action r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but this may be the most disarming performance she's done in cinema. Sorry, Mandy.<br /><br />For all its hip sensibilities, TANGLED still clings to Disney's traditional themes, which I think is a good move. Too much adult snarkiness could've undermined the sweetness and the heart of the story. And this story does have heart, to go along with a sweet, relatable romance, Mother Gothel's showstopping tune "Mother Knows Best," wet wi11ies, a pack of Viking ruffians to stir the plot whenever it threatens to bog down, and a thoughtful curveball ending. And a broken smolder.<br /><br />This single disc's extra features (and it's not much): "Original Storybook Openings" - two different versions of the film's prologue; and "50th Animated Feature Countdown" - which counts down Disney's fifty animated films from SNOW WHITE & THE SEVEN DWARVES to TANGLED.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dazzling stage performances, but not enough dramatic moments."></head><body><p>Dreamgirls is a certainly highly-entertaining, and it's not a entirely a musical, because there is more talking than singing of the dialogues. It's a fast-paced ala biopic of The Supremes. It's a good story about friendship, trust, and faith between the three/four dream girls through the years. I personally like Eddie Murphy the most because his performance is simply sassy and funny, and at the same time there was emotion to the more dramatic moments at his character's downfall. Jamie Foxx is very convincing as a no-good all manipulative manager. I find that while there is plenty of singing photo shoots scenes for Beyonce to work with and she was fabulous in them, I was craving for more dramatic scenes for her character. Considered that she's not a singer turned actress, and it's her first starring role, she did struck gold. However it's Jennifer Hudson the less attractive of the dream girls who had the juiciest and scene-stealing part to work with. As a newcomer, she was best when she gets to sing her emotions out. A very strong moment was when she gets to do that number called I am Telling You I am Not Going. I have a feeling either Murphy or her will get an Oscar nod in the supporting category. Perhaps the costumes will get a nominations too.</p></body></html>

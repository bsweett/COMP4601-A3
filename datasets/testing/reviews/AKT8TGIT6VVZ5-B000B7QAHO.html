<meta name="summary" content="Splendid, Darker, Truer Adaptation of  Dahl's Novel"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is a much darker film adaptation of the Road Dahl novel than "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". Without question, this adaptation is much truer in spirit to the dark, caustic humor of Dahl's prose. I don't exaggerate stating that in Burton, Dahl has found the best artistic kindred spirit capable of rendering his tale into film, while Johnny Depp is a more troubled, emotionally disturbed Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder's exuberant version. And yet, inspite of its often morose, dark spirit, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is deliciously funny, especially in the scenes where Charlie Buckett's (Freddie Highmore) obnoxious young companions get their just desserts (Each time this happens, the film goes into warp speed, offering scenes which are hysterically funny.). As Charlie, Freddie Highmore offers yet another spellbinding performance (He acted alongside Depp in "Finding Neverland", portraying the young boy who was the inspiration for Peter Pan.), portraying the young hero of Dahl's novel as a generous, thoughtful kid who is wiser beyond his years. David Kelly's portrayal of Grandpa Joe is also spellbinding, as the dear old friend and confidant to young Charlie Bucket. Composer Danny Elfman contributes an intriguing musical score which runs the gamut from Philip Glass to the Beatles and Kiss in its musical influences; it may be the most consistently exuberant aspect of this film, along with the lavish sets constructed for the Wonka Chocolate Factory. And speaking of exuberance, there's a silly, but appropriate homage to the opening scenes of Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" which I think is absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed viewing this film, which I would recommend without reservation to any kid above the age of five (However, there may be some scenes, such as the "squirrel attack" which may be disturbing to some younger children.). My only reservation is in Burton's shifting of the tale from Charlie's to Wonka's perspective, adding in a rather gratuitious series of flashbacks with a young Wonka and his dentist father portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lee. This leads unfortunately to a rather extended ending in which Wonka comes to grips finally with maturity (If I write more, I will be yielding a major spoiler!). Still, despite this caveat, I have no doubt that many will find this film most enjoyable.  I couldn't help but laugh at every funny moment, joined by a chorus of enthusiastic film goers each time I've seen "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". It is my favorite film of the summer so far, and one destined to become a future cinematic classic.</p></body></html>

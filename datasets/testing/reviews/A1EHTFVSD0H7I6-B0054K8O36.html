I did miss Bloom and Knightley, but Depp is still good/bad ol Cap'n Jack, and Rush is back as well bringing his creepy elements to the whole story. Penelope Cruz adds a little feminine touch as the daughter (? is she or isn't she?)  of the infamous Blackbeard.<br /><br />And speaking of feminine touch. I will NEVER look at a mermaid quite the same way again. Shudder. Who knew?<br /><br />If you are a big fan of Depp and Captain Jack you will probably need to watch this at least once. And if you are waffling as to whether to invest your money and your time in number 4... Red Box or Netflix it. A few laughs, some neat special effects, a couple of fights, some nastiness and those mermaids....ugh.</p></body></html>

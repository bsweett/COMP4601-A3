In all of my thirty plus years none of the clips I've seen of this movie even hinted to me that I might like this movie.  None.  And I do like some of Julie Andrews work: Mary Poppins, Victor/Victoria are two that comes to mind.  But a woman whirling around on a mountain top--not so much.  Then for some reason that I don't remember now, I sat down and watch it.  AND I LOOOOOOVVVVE IT.  What fun!  The music, the optimism and the theme of the importance of family. Beautiful.  I was smiling and singing as I watched this movie. I even found the ending suspenseful.  I now have to buy this soundtrack.  Just gotta.  High Recommended.</p></body></html>

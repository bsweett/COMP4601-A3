<meta name="summary" content="The tallest elf around."></head><body><p>Elf starring the hilarious Will Ferrel, James Caan, and Zooey Deschanel is a cute and funny holiday film. I wasn't expecting much before I watched it, but Elf is a gem from beginning to end. Ferrell's performance brings both wide-eyed innocence and hypersensitive drama to the extreme. Parts of this film are so silly but enjoyable. This is a new holiday classic, just as good as A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation. Elf will have you weeping like an infant from laughing so much. Defintely one to add to your holiday collection. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

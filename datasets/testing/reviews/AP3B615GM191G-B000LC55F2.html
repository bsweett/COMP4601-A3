<meta name="summary" content="In My Top Five Films Of All-Time"></head><body><p>Some movies are so well-made and incredible that words often fail to describe their exact appeal without spoiling it for everyone else.  "The Prestige", firmly ensconced on my "Top Five Favorite Films of All-Time" list, is one of those film experiences.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Prestige" sees two young magicians dueling with each other to see which one can have the most spectacular act.  Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a family man yet also devoted to his craft, while Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is more of a natural showman with an obsession for greatness.  Gorgeous assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) & stage manager Cutter (Michael Caine) are also involved with both magicians.<br /><br />This film is an all-time great primarily because of its tremendous plot.  I won't say much about it here for fear of spoilers, but suffice it to say that director Christopher Nolan picked the perfect subject--magic--with which to tell this incredible story.  In terms of overall storytelling, this may just be one of the greatest ever told.<br /><br />The acting is also superb, with Bale & Jackman absolutely brilliant as the leads and Johansson stunning in her role as well.  Caine provides a moral character to the show, while also doing a voice-over that rivals even the great Morgan Freeman.  Even all the auxiliary roles in this one are perfectly cast.<br /><br />Basically, "The Prestige" is a movie that simply needs to be watched by all.  Unless you have no imagination or appreciation for film whatsoever, you will find yourself completely caught up in the grandeur of "The Prestige".  It even rivals Nolan's "Batman" series in terms of dramatic intensity, which should tell you all you need to know.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ONCE AGAIN... millions of $$$ spent to make a forgettable film"></head><body><p>ERAGON holds lots of promise. First of all, fantasy/adventure is a genre that isn't explored enough these days. You can count the number of fantasy films made over the years on your fingers and toes. Of course, you have the Lord of the Rings, Dragonheart, Dragonslayer, Conan etc. Secondly, how many times do you get to see a huge fire breathing dragon that looks really cool and REAL? Excellent effects.<br /><br />So, why only two stars?<br /><br />ERAGON is based on a book written by Christopher Paolini, who is most noteably known for beginning writting ERAGON when he was fifteen years-old. Good for him. I wish I were so lucky with the novel I wrote in high school.<br /><br />I haven't read the novel, but after watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that many of it seemed borrowed from other films. Many young writers write stories that steal from films they have seen. I know because I did. I know because many fellow writers I know struggled with the same thing. It's just nature. You watch movies and something grabs you. So, you cook up your own version in your head and put it to paper.<br /><br />So, with ERAGON, you get a story of a boy who falls into his destiny as a dragon rider. Yet, many of the themes of the film are borrowed from other films, like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragonheart, Harry Potter etc.<br /><br />ERAGON is a decent film. Yet, a forgettable one. I'm just disappointed that hollywood has once again put its weight behind a novelty movie. There have been many fantasy stories written in recent years, and many of them would have been more memorable and more lasting films. Yet, they weren't written by a teenager.<br /><br />Oh, and of course there's a sequel coming. I wonder if people will still be interested when the sequel comes out?</p></body></html>

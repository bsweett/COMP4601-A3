<meta name="summary" content="WOW!"></head><body><p>Hero, brings to the screen the story of a warrior who rids the realm of three assassins who threaten the emperor's life. The story gets more complicated as things are not as they seem in China...<br /><br />The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!<br /><br />Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film.<br /><br />The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.<br /><br />Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.<br /><br />Needless to say, Jet Li, Tony Leung Chui Wai, Maggie Cheung, Ziyi Zhang, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, yet alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts.<br /><br />Strongly recommended along with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The House of Flying Daggers, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese.</p></body></html>

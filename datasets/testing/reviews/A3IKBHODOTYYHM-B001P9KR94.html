<meta name="summary" content="Somewhat fantasy, but a film with heart"></head><body><p>Jamal sits in a room, encountering an intense police investigation, as they try to figure out how a young, uneducated kid from the slums could possibly have known all the answers during his appearance on India's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" We are taken through a series of flashbacks as he is questioned, and we learn about young Jamal's life with his brother, the difficulties and tragedies he's faced (such as the murder of his mother), the places he's been, and his initial meeting with childhood friend and eventual love, Latika. As perplexing as it seems, his ability to answer is based on some amazing coincidences, and he's also been able to find Latika several times and once even saves her from the clutches of a gangster. It seems that every time he catches up with her, fate intervenes and it is a short lived moment. The film moves back to the present, and the officers who interrogate the young man come to understand who he is. The two major conflicts within the story are: will Jamal be able to finally see Latika, his true love, and will he be the next millionaire. Certainly the love story takes precedent over his appearance on the show.<br /><br />There's a certain Dickens-like quality to the film, as it has amazing coincidences and a "rags-to-riches" feel to it. From the depths of poverty, the protagonist experiences pain in life but rebounds, and is given the chance of a lifetime.  There's also an aspect to the production where we cannot expect to take things at face value; things have a fantasy element to them, and the story can be likened to a parable about love or overcoming one's roadblocks in life.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire presents the often done "rags to riches" story in a unique manner and setting, and the film is worthy of its best picture status for 2008 (an award that has become a sham of late). Still, I felt that at some points the film dragged on a bit, and began to lose steam, and took some of the film's power with it. There is some violence, and some language, and the "feel good" label attached to Slumdog could be misleading without the resolution at the end.<br /><br />Over all, though, this is a film with heart, and its story was presented effectively. I'm glad I finally had the chance to see it.</p></body></html>

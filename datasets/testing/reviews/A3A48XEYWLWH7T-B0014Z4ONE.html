<meta name="summary" content="Genre defining blockbuster."></head><body><p>Watching Raiders presented in the new box set on big screen HDTV brought back all the excitement of seeing it the first time.  Harrison Ford in his signature role, building on the cavalier tough/nice guy Han Solo routine, makes the film what it is.  Sweeping in scope, Indy journeys across continents as a little red line on maps to fight the Nazis prior to WWII.  Their mutual goal, the discovery of the lost ark of the covenant, containing the 10 commandment tablets.  The fight and chase scenes are marvelously staged; doing without the sterile CG accompaniment of today's movies.  The soundtrack is complimentarily epic and unforgettable, as are the sometimes brutal action sequences that Lucas and Spielberg would mellow considerably in following films.  This film redefined the action/adventure genre with its humour, action, acting, and location shots.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

Sure, there's a story...but it only pops up between flashes of CGI and a bombastic score.  For that matter, the special effects are very average, at best; horrible, at their worst.  There were also frequent moments during the film that conjured up images of an even worse film, "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."  I was distracted enough by the excruciatingly beautiful Kate Beckinsale to make it to the end of the film.  But the plotting is piece-meal and erroneous, taking a backseat to the pretty lights, fast camera shots, and Kate's gorgeous eyes.  The main characters should've died numerous times during the film.  They are not X-Men, after all.  When one of them does expire it happens in a manner that is feeble compared to what was endured earlier.  Having "Frankenstein's Monster" wax intellectual was also extremely ridiculous.  This film is nonsense, even for a fantasy yarn.<br /><br />The Narrow(or how to make it to the end of this film):  Get a labotomy.  Go in thinking this movie is going to be incredibly dumb and it might elevate itself to mediocrity.  If Kate Beckinsale hadn't been in this movie, I would've thrown unspeakable, rotting things at the screen.  Try very hard to suspend your disbelief...if you can.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unique Concept - Excellent Story - Very Good Execution"></head><body><p>This was a wonderful movie.  It was a unique concept based on some Far Eastern myth.  It captivated me through out because I had no idea where it was going.  The acting was good.  It included suspense, romance, misdirection, a little scifi, a little fantasy.  I will definitely add this to my collection!</p></body></html>

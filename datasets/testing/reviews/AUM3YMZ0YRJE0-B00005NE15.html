<meta name="summary" content="strong and scary, but a pot boiler"></head><body><p>This is an elaborate production of a pretty basic ghost story.  The plot aside, it never got past the point of disbelief for me:  while watching it, I constantly felt that someone was just making it up.  It simply did not sweep me into the narrative and get me to forget real life for a minute, it never scared me.  Nonetheless, the images are vivid, the actors are good, etc.  There just wasn't anything about it that struck me as original or worth the price.  Recommended tepidly.</p></body></html>

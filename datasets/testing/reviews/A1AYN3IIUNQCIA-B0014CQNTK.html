For me, Fox's Searchlight studio has become my personal favorite for extremly great indie comedies. They scored last year with Little Miss Sunshine (another film I absolutly love) and they do it again with Juno. But for me, I feel Juno really achieved something far greater then Little Miss Sunshine did. Not only did the film make me laugh but when I left the theater, I just couldn't help but feel uplifted and joyous. It's just one of those films that not only has a great wit but a real heart inside it. Something I did not feel with Knocked Up and Superbad and I know, people will hate me for saying that, but its true. For me, Juno was the only comedy that, I felt, really achieved the true 'heart' of a film.<br /><br />Now, most everyone is by now familiar with the story but i'll just do it again just to refresh those who have gone fuzzy. Juna MacGuff has just found out she is nine weeks pregnant, the father happening to be her longtime friend and admirer Paulie Bleaker. After originally thinking about an abortion, she has a last minute change of heart and decides to give the baby up for adoption to a family she looked up in the local Pennysaver. We are then taken through the entire process of Juno dealing with her pregnancy, the adoptive family, just really everyday life that a pregnant teen can go through.<br /><br />Now, I have been a fan of Ellen Page (Oscar Nominated this year, kudos) ever since I saw her in Hard Candy (a film that I felt really showed off her dramatic range), I just think she really is a talented young actress and true role model girls AND guys can look up to. As Juno, she combines a blend of biting wit, teen angst, and even motherly instinct into a fire cracker of a character. Another standout being Jennifer Garner, who just completly transforms her character from an icy, controling person to someone caring and warm by the end of the film. J.K. Simmons, Jason Batemen, Allison Janney, and Olivia Thirlby are also just as good, Thirlby I think having all the best lines.<br /><br />And of course, we cannot forget Diablo Cody, who crafted a heartful and witty screenplay from a topic that could have easily been just another run of the mill teen pregnancy film. If she dosen't win the Originally Screenplay Oscar, I will automatically call for a recount. As for Jason Reitman, I feel he does a good job directing this film, obviously having a flare for making smart comedies (like his previous effort, Thank You for Smoking, another great film from Searchlight) but I don't feel he should have been nominated for Best Director, I felt that the fifth slot really should have gone so Joe Wright (director of the beautiful Atonement) but still, I felt he did his job.<br /><br />I would definently place Juno on my top ten of 2007, cause for me it was one of the few highly praised films this year that I truley felt delivered on everything the critics praised about. But then again, I rarely agree with the critics, so even more props to the film that really connected with all audiences and not something that only the critics seemed to have got. So, if you truely, TRUELY, want to see a film that will not only make you laugh but give you that warm fuzzy feeling, Juno is definently the film to see.</p></body></html>

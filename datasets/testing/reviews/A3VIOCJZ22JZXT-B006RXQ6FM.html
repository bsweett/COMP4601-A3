<meta name="summary" content="We know more of doubt than we know of certainty"></head><body><p>The film based on John Patrick Shanley's play is superbly done. The actors are in top form with Meryl Streep and Seymour Hoffman demonstrating consider acting force as a nun and a priest in a struggle for competing versions of reality. It is basically about the quest for truth in a world of incomplete clues and hints. The search for truth may lead to a broad range of consequences depending on whose truth is accepted and whose truth is rejected. Sister Aloysius, the Catholic school principal, played by Meryl Streep, is convinced that she has discovered a truth about Father Brendan Flynn, a robust likable assertive priest, played by Seymour Hoffman.<br /><br />A great strength of the films script is that Shanley leaves the mystery somewhat unresolved in the screen play. Though some film viewers may have concluded that Father Flynn did have some improper behavior with a student, there is still much room for doubt since Father Muller could have been transferred to another Catholic parish to avoid Sister Aloysius' continued assault on his reputation and his peace of mind.<br /><br />The film begins with the central theme of the play, as given in a sermon by Father Flynn. He states: "What do you do when you are not sure?"  The play cascades from this point with Sister Aloysius convinced of Father Flynn's guilt and Sister James wracked with moral uncertainty as to what is true or not true and what are the moral consequences for each decision.<br /><br />Each clue in the film propels you toward one solution until you are given another clue drawing you in the opposite direction and conclusion. In this way, Sister James acts as the viewer and she voices some of the same trusts and doubts that must be in the mind of every viewer of the film. Some viewers of the film will not rush to judgment and will absorb the subtle clues that propel this clash of characters forward.  Other viewers of the film will take sides since Father Flynn is a likeable, robust, assertive, clever, strong, person who is contrasted with the cold rock strength and certainty of Sister Aloysius, who is never presented as especially warm or compassionate yet her actions speak to great compassion if indeed she fully believes she is interrupting the sexual predatory actions of Father Flynn.<br /><br />The film even takes a surprise direction when we hear from Donald Muller's mother who tells us her son is an effeminate child who was been repeatedly beaten in public schools as well as by his father for his effeminate behaviors. In Catholic school, his mother hoped he would be protected. His mother sees the possible attentions of this white priest toward her son as far more desirable than the hostility he experiences from young males in public school or from his own father. The character of Mrs. Muller is unexpected, wonderfully acted, and throws a complete different light onto the actions of the play. Sister Aloysius thought she had found a partner and then found more than for which she had bargained.<br /><br />The film comes to a resolution, one that I will not reveal and one that not every viewer will like or appreciate. But the human condition requires doubt, and certainty is so rare that we rightfully distrust it, doubt is far more likely to be the fate of human beings.</p></body></html>

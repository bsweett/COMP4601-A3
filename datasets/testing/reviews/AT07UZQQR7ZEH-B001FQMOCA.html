<meta name="summary" content="A first-class musical  biography"></head><body><p>WALK THE LINE, the Johnny Cash-June Carter story, is an exhilarating musical biography.  It starts in 1968 inside Folsom Prison, flashes back to Cash's childhood in the Deep South of the early 1950's, then works its way back up to 1968 and beyond.  With brilliant performances by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar nominee) and Reese Witherspoon (Oscar winner), Cash's life and music career come alive.  Both actors spent months learning how to do their own singing and guitar playing live before an audience, and it shows in the electrifying musical numbers.<br /><br />Director/co-writer James Mangold filmed the movie on location in Memphis, Nashville, and Arkansas along (I think) the Mississippi River.  The 1950's and 1960's sets and costumes, from my own childhood era, are perfection and should have been Oscar-nominated if they weren't.  The film runs 135 minutes, but between the concert scenes and period re-creation, I never wanted it to end.  If WALK THE LINE has any flaw, in fact, it is that it could have lasted longer for me and didn't just put three more decades of narrative crawls against a black finale background.  I wanted more music and more of the perfect Phoenix and Witherspoon performances.<br /><br />This may be one of the finest musical biographies I have ever seen.  The DVD includes a directors' commentary and 10 deleted scenes that help clarify scene and character. WALK THE LINE is a beautifully crafted labor of love movie gem.  It particularly deserved the Sound Mixing Oscar nomination for spectacular concert scenes.  The movie plays and sounds, inexplicably, way better on DVD than in a theater. It is an absolute must-see. NOTE: Made in Panavision; buy or rrent the widescreen version.  Amazon.com is selling it at half-price.</p></body></html>

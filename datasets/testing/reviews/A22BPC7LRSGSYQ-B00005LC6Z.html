This sequel to Halloween is generally a good movie that is designed to be a continuation of the night of October 31, 1978, when Michael Myers terrorized the babysitting Laurie Strode and her friends, one of which was also babysitting, while others were just goofing around having a good time.  Halloween is a classic.  That movie ends with Michael Myers being shot by Dr. Sam Loomis, only to run away seconds later.  That was supposed to be it.  John Carpenter and Debra Hill did not have a sequel in mind.  But they were pressured into making a sequel.  John Carpenter has said that when it was time to write the screenplay he was drawing a blank.  He didn't know what to write.  Finally he started to come up with ideas, even going as far as making Laurie Strode Michael Myers' sister.  Now that is a sign of somebody who is trying to come up with a screenplay for a movie he didn't even want to make (see my review of Halloween III - Season Of The Witch for a more thorough analysis)  You see, the original game plan after Halloween was to make a different Halloween movie every year with a completely different story and theme than the previous movie, sort of like the old The Twilight Zone TV show.  Michael Myers was never meant to keep appearing in movie after movie.  It was supposed to stop after Halloween.  Well, OK, they made the second movie, so it was supposed to stop after Halloween II, when Michael Myers burned to death.  It did.  For one movie.  Halloween III did not have Michael Myers in it.  It's a great movie that goes in the direction that Carpenter and Hill wanted to go into after Halloween - making a different Halloween movie every year with an entirely different story.  The general public didn't like Halloween III.  Carpenter and Hill then ended their involvement with the franchise.<br /><br />Now about Halloween II...<br /><br />This movie begins with showing the last few moments of Halloween, when Michael Myers is shot by Dr. Loomis.  This footage is mostly alternate unused takes shot while Halloween was being filmed in 1978, while some of the footage are the actual takes that were used in the first movie.  If you pay attention, you'll notice that Loomis fires seven shots at Michael Myers.  In the first movie, he fires six.  Anyway, Myers gets away and starts to stalk around town.  It is clear that this movie was influenced by the movies that were coming out at the time that featured lots of blood and splatter scenes.  It's unfortunate, because Halloween didn't rely on blood to be effective.  But in Halloween II it seems that Carpenter and Hill were feeling the pressure of the marketplace, so they made it like a Friday The 13th movie as far as the blood and gore goes.  To sum up the story, Michael Myers is trying to find his SISTER Laurie Strode, who was taken to the hospital after being injured in the first Halloween.  Myers stalks her at the near empty (and creepy) hospital and kills some of the hospital staff along the way.  At the end of the movie it appears that Michael Myers has burned to death.  He DID burn to death after Dr. Loomis flicks his lighter while gas fills the air that causes an explosion.  In fact, you have to believe that Loomis was killed in that explosion, also.  But seven years later there was this movie that came out called Halloween 4 - The Return Of Michael Myers.  What it really was was an opportunity to resurrect Michael Myers for the sake of making $$$$.  If Jason Voorhees and Freddie Krueger are invincible, why not make Michael Myers invincible?  It means $$$$, plain and simple.  If there's anything good about the continuation of the series beginning with Halloween 4, it's that at least John Carpenter and Debra Hill weren't involved.  They were long gone, because they were smart.  The first Halloween movie was an independent film.  That's one reason why it's so good.  Once Hollywood takes over a franchise, forget it.  That's why the whole series is so screwed up.  There is no continuity.  Halloween H2O is really the sequel to Halloween II.<br /><br />The musical score to Halloween II is good, but not as good as the first movie.  The movie overall just doesn't compare to the first one, but it is still a pretty good movie.  A lot of the feel of the first movie was absent in this second movie, though it does get major points for the creepy atmosphere at the hospital late at night.  You'll see some things that make this "continuation of the night" seem like a different movie altogether.  But if you take this movie at face value, it IS an entertaining movie.  Just not the same as the first one.  4 stars</p></body></html>

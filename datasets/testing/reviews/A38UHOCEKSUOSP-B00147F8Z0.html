<meta name="summary" content="[3.5] Looks better on Blu"></head><body><p>I had reiewed AVP:R not too long ago after I watched it in the theatre, and I have never reviewed a film on Blu-Ray before, but I felt AVP:R on Blu-Ray would make a positive review for this movie that has never-ending bashing by probably 7/10 people.  True this film is a real disspointment to the overall Alien and Predator genre, but that isn't due to the Aliens and Predator in this film, in fact, they are what save it.  They look better than ever, provide some excellent action and decent scares, and the Pred-Alien is a great addition to keep things fresh.  It's the humans that ruined it (can't we at least get one decent actor here?) and their forgettable plots.  Oh yes, and the fact that those good scenes featuring the Aliens and Predator are always so darned dark.  Oh wait, that's where Blu-Ray can help.  Yes, those scenes are always going to be annoyingly dark at times, but Blu can make the most of it.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray disc is actully an excellent transfer of video quality.  The films look pristine for the most part, and is a much less fuzzy picture than the fist AVP film on Blu-Ray.  Ironically, the dark scenes in that film just got too fuzzy, but the dark scenes in AVP:R (which are more abundant) remain pretty clear.  Yes they are still dark, but I found myself seeing things at home I missed in the theatre.  Of course it helps is you have a nice television set that displays HD and you watch this at night in the dark, but hey, if you don't mind the effort, you can actually make out what is going on in the film.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray disc also features the unrated edition, which isn't anything to get overworked for.  It contains a few more minutes of gore, but nothing any more exciting than what is available in the theatrical release.<br /><br />Ok, so AVP:R still has it problem spots, but at least if you can afford to watch it on Blu-Ray go ahead, cause one of those problem spots can be remedied.  And that Predator is still one bad dude.<br /><br />Action: 4<br />Acting: 1.5<br />Blu Ray Audio: 4<br />Blu-Ray Video: 4.5<br />Characters: 1<br />Gore: 4<br />Horror: 3<br />Story: 1</p></body></html>

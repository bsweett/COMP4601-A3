Kate Beckinsale returns as the vampire Selene and Scott Speedman returns as the half-vampire, half-werewolf Michael.<br /><br />Selene and Michael team up to stop the first vampire Marcus (Curran) from freeing his werewolf brother William (Steele). Bill Nighy makes appearance as Victor in a past scene.<br /><br />Len Wiseman does another great job with the dark visuals in this film, and the setting is awesome. To me, the story in this one was better than the original one, but everyone has their own opinion.<br /><br />I said if I like this film, I would give the first one a second chance, and I will. Once I see it again, I'll give in my review. Forget BloodRayne, Selene is way better than her (at least the film version of BloodRayne). If you're a fan or not a fan of the first Underworld, go checkout this cool sequel.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Incredible Visual Invention in an Overabundant Story"></head><body><p>This film reflects amazing visual invention, and first-time writer/director Kerry Conran, self-professed computer geek, has fashioned something remarkably singular from his fertile imagination, his obviously encyclopedic knowledge of pre-WWII popular culture, and most of all, his technological savvy. What he has created is impressive - a self-contained world of startling images that seem simultaneously futuristic and retro in a colorized black-and-white world bathed in diffuse lighting and stylized art deco designs. Moving like a speeding train, the plot is stuffed with so many references to other classic stories and movies it often gets overwhelming, and I have to admit some of the turns get very convoluted as a result. As a pop culture junkie myself, I see tributes to George Pal's "War of the Worlds", Ray Harryhausen's special effects in "Jason and the Argonauts", Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World", James Hilton's "Lost Horizon", Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World", Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" trilogy and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", George Lucas' "Star Wars" especially in the aerial chase scenes, and the stiff upper lip of British WWII films. Whew! That's a lot for a 103-minute film, but Conran does an extraordinary job of spinning his plates into a truly exciting film. Beyond that, it amazes me that most of the action was done against a blue screen, as the people and images seamlessly meld together. There are incredible sequences involving gigantic robots trampling New York, fanciful aerial air strips with dozens of fighter planes, swarms of automated winged weapons among others, and they are sequenced at a lightning-fast pace.<br /><br />The actors are well cast, though the best compliment one can pay them is that they don't get in the way of the action. In fact, their relative nonchalance to the extraordinary things going on around them is a major part of the fun. The omnipresent Jude Law, who is bordering on overexposure these days, cuts a dashing figure as the nominal hero, though he seems too lightweight and frankly a bit too earnest to be truly memorable. Ah, if Harrison Ford was only two decades younger... Gwyneth Paltrow plays the obligatory Lois Lane part, aptly named Polly Perkins, with a saucy mix of Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo allure (I love the skirt slitting shot) and Barbara Stanwyck's tough-dame savvy. Certainly this is quite a departure from the jetset vagabonds Law and Paltrow played in "The Talented Mr. Ripley", though their patrician attractiveness does confirm how well suited they are for period movies. In an all-too-brief part late in the film, Angelina Jolie is wonderfully gutsy as a veddy British naval captain, finally able to use her striking looks (not to mention her arresting eyepatch) to great effect. Not every actress can get away with a line like "Alert the amphibious squad!". In smaller roles, Giovanni Ribisi as the bubblegum-chewing Dex and British comedian Omid Djalili as Vienna sausage-loving Kaji seem to function purely as plot devices to move the story along. Conran understandably uses characters as chess pieces because the visual elements are what make this story percolate.<br /><br />I only wish Conran could have simplified the story a bit to let us absorb more of what's going on. I felt a little out of breath every time the locale changed since I wasn't sure I grasped everything I needed to know up to that point. I also think it's a bit of a conceit to "cast" the late Laurence Olivier as the primary villain since it feeds into one of the final plot twists. By the way, a great ending line awaits. Regardless, Conran is definitely a talent to watch, and it makes me wonder what he could possibly do next. Highly recommended fun.</p></body></html>

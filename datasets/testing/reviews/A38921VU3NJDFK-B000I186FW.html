<meta name="summary" content="V for Vendetta (2005)"></head><body><p>V for Vendetta, a film version of Alan Moore's graphic novel, is set in a futuristic totalitarian Britain and peruses the chords of politics through the vengeful eyes of a mysterious, masked rebel-fighter known as "V". Produced by The Matrix's Wachowski brothers, and directed stylishly by then-newcomer James McTeigue, this roaring, action-packed flick manages a rare brand of intelligence and lucratively enthuses the idea that citizens run by governments are na?ve to the confines of such leadership and are too quick to conform. V for Vendetta perpetrated Hollywood's long-since-owed delivery of a film equally rich in smarts and entertainment value--somewhat of a rarity in the sci-fi and action genres, lately.</p></body></html>

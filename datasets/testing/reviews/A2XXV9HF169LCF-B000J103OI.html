<meta name="summary" content="Lovely movie, rotten message."></head><body><p>So this should be sub-titled "A cautionary tale for girls". The basic message seems to be "don't be ambitious, girls, it'll make you miserable and bitter and nobody will like you or be close to you. Be content with smaller things and don't dream big, it's too scary out there." Either that or "Don't change who you are inside for the high life, don't betray your friends, it's morally wrong and makes you into a bad person who doesn't like or recognize herself and it's not worth it".<br /><br />One of those messages should be listened to by all those silly girls desperately wearing the aggressively trashy clothing and excessive bling; the other is a crock of bad beans.<br /><br />Aside from that it's a wonderful movie and I enjoyed it immensely.</p></body></html>

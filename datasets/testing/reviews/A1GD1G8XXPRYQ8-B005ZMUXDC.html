The plot of the story is interesting and reminded me of some other fairy tales. Voice acting is really good and witty humor in some places just makes the story and characters look even better. The soundtrack is just fine and the animation is not short in duration, which I liked and was right for the animation. It isn't too short and isn't too long. However, I would still probably enjoy it if the animation was even longer in time. The story goes in depth and is really interesting. The created world is also very beautiful. I didn't make the wrong choice and was pleasantly surprised by how well everything was created. This is the animation that must stand among my favorite animations on my shelf. And it is for any ages, kids or adults.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good DVD for top-notch pulp movie, but better DVD out there"></head><body><p>If this were a straight "movie review," I'd give Robert Rodriguez's (and Frank Miller's) "Sin City" five stars.  But this is a DVD review, so the product itself gets a mere four stars.  Buyers beware -- there is a "Recut, etc." edition of this DVD that has a heck of a lot more in the way of cookies, extras, and all those other little treats that make DVDs so much fun.  This is a "smaller" DVD with fewer extras.  Make sure you're buying the correct edition.<br /><br />On to the movie.  "Sin City" throws the audience into Frank Miller's ultra-hard-boiled comic metropolis, Basin City (aka "Sin City").  One wonders how this city functions, as its only inhabitants appear to be cops (generally corrupt, with one lone exception), prostitutes (generally, with one lone exception, with hearts of gold), criminal scum, and corrupt politicians.  I pity the schoolteacher who works at Basin City Senior High School.<br /><br />A revolutionary use of digital filmmaking technology allows "Sin City" to be told in the same stark black-and-white color scheme that makes Frank Miller's graphic novels so much fun.  There are occasional blasts of color, but generally black-and-white rules the day.<br /><br />Fans of Miller's graphic novels will see no surprises in "Sin City," other than the technical skill with which the filmmakers translate the comix to the big screen.  This is almost a shot-for-shot remake of three graphic novels:  "The Hard Goodbye," "The Big Fat Kill," and "That Yellow Bastard."  There is also a very brief short story that sort of bookends the film, based on Miller's short tale "The Babe Wore Red."  These are essentially the same stories exactly as Miller wrote them in his graphic novels, only slightly truncated for time.<br /><br />But the tone is all there.  Miller's Holy Trinity appears to be "Bullets, Booze and Broads," the title of his collection of short story comix set in Basin City.  And boy, does this movie bring the goods.<br /><br />I'll leave the summarizing of the plot for other reviewers.  I'll just give you my reaction.  "Sin City" is one of those movies that qualifies as a "Great Guilty Pleasure."  There's nothing "redeeming" or "important" or "telling a story that needs to be told" in "Sin City."  It's Dashiell Hammet's "The Maltese Falcon" for the 21st century.  The acting is all just this side of over-the-top, which qualifies as perfectly restrained given Miller's hyperbolic stories.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen . . . these are fine actors, but "they don't do nuance."  And that's perfectly appropriate.  There are several fine performances by the actresses, too, as Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba emerge as the most memorable amongst the bevy of beauties who live in Sin City's Amazonia, Old Town.<br /><br />All in all, "Sin City" is a thrill ride, the kind of movie where a man can describe his girlfriend as a "Valkyrie," and it comes across as perfectly appropriate, given the hard-boiled circumstances.  Check it out, but just make sure you're buying the right DVD edition.</p></body></html>

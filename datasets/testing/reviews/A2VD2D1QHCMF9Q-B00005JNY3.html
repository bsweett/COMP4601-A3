<meta name="summary" content="Effective conclusion but spare me the musical score!"></head><body><p>A young woman is hired to take care of an ailing old man who lives with his wife in an old, haunting house an hour away from New Orleans.  We know immediately that something strange is going to happen because the music is haunting, and overwhelming.  A bit too overwhelming.<br /><br />As time goes on, odd things happen, particularly with respect to the old man.  Is he really as sick as he appears, or is the old woman doing something to control and sicken him, and if so, why?  There is also something creepy about the lawyer.  Who is he, really.  And, of course, there is the house.  Is it haunted or is there something in there that, in effect, hypnotizes the protagonist into seeing something that isn't there.  Why does the wife act in such mysterious ways.  What is hoodoo and is it real or a fiction?  All of these questions come together at the end of the movie, and in a satisfactory way.<br /><br />The music is annoying and destroys one's concentration, and has the opposite effect for which it apparently was inserted.  I found that the movie would have been more sinister if the music had less emphasis.  Also, Kate Hudson is attractive, and young, too attractive and too young for this part.  She was just not a credible choice for a woman who is to be taking care of an old man, stealthily gong through what could only be described as a haunted house, getting into the "dark arts," confronting the old woman, etc.  This part should have been for someone appearing as less of an ingenue.</p></body></html>

Alexandre Aja's first film to be seen in the U.S. is one of a rare breed of horror films.  Not many horror films can claim to truly create tension for the viewer like most of the classic horror films did.  As I was leaving the theater at the end of High Tension, I was angry and frustrated.  I hated the ending.  I thought the twist made no sense, and made a good film into a token Hollywood piece of crap.  After second viewing, however, I could watch the film and be more appreciative of what it does accomplish, and, while I still don't like the ending, I think that I can understand why the filmmakers did what they did.<br /><br />The plot of High Tension is simple: Marie and Alex are friends from college.  Its exam week, so the girls head up to Alex's family's place in the middle of nowhere in France to have some private, uninterrupted study time.  Everything seems to be normal until everyone falls asleep on the first night.  A maniac descends upon the family and random, gruesome acts of violence ensue, with a couple pretty original kills.  No one in the film is really developed so that we care about what is going on.  It only takes 20 minutes of film time for the deaths to start piling up.  After the initial mayhem at the house, Marie follows the murderer into his truck, and a gory road trip follows, leaving bodies in its wake.<br /><br />A film like High Tension isn't made to win any awards.  It is made to provide some scares, and some thrills.  It is a very tense movie, and Aja does a great job of milking every scene totally dry of its ability to put us on the edge of our seat.  The gore is also fairly impressive, especially the scenes involving some type of chainsaw-like tool near the end.<br /><br />There are only two real drawbacks to the film.  The first is, as already mentioned, the ending, which I didn't like, but am willing to deal with.  The second is the fact that, since the film was made in France, you have to watch it either with subtitles or dubbing.  I almost prefer subtitles, due to the fact that dubbing is just too ridiculous-looking to ignore.  I would recommend High Tension to any horror aficionado, who will appreciate a horror film for what it is supposed to do, not what some hope it will do.<br /><br />High Tension is a bold, dark, gruesome look into every person's heart of darkness.  This movie is definitely not for those who have weak stomachs.</p></body></html>

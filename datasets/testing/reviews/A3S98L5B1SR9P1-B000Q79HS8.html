<meta name="summary" content="Yikes. *SPOILERS*"></head><body><p>This was nothing compared to the first film (The Bourne Identity). All we see are 108 minutes of Jason Bourne running around Germany. There's only about 15 minutes of action, and it's at the end of the film. We also do not learn anything about him, except that he killed two people. Also, is it just me, or was the camerawork in this film annoying? The cameraman needs to be fired. I could not follow any scenes with even remote action. It seemed as though they were trying to fit every angle into every shot. The camerawork was so damn bad, that you couldn't follow the story, which is probably how I wound up with my conclusion that hardly anything happens. However, from what I seen (yes, I did pay attention to the film), hardly ANYTHING happened. This film has the worst cinematography I've EVER seen (and that's saying ALOT), and this film is one of the most PLOTLESS films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The first film outshines this one by a mile.<br /><br />I also relied on what the critics said when I rented this, but after viewing it, I regret doing so.<br /><br />The camera work in this movie is enough to give you motion sickness. This is a 108 minute movie based on a very short plot. The filming will leave you with a headache as the camera is constantly shaking as if you were running with the characters or riding in a car on a very bumpy road. I could not enjoy the story because the camera work was so bad that it distracted from the movie. I don't know how the movie has received such a high rating. With the camera jumping around so much it was visually distracting so much that you can not enjoy it. I have the first one on DVD but I will not buy this one.<br /><br />They should've used a SteadyCam.<br />The cinematography gives a new meaning to "Sh-Sh-Shake it like a Polaroid picture!" (HAHAHA. Okay, yeah, that was bad.)<br /><br />Okay, I know you're saying "ENOUGH ABOUT THE CAMERAWORK!".<br />Julia Stiles was great for the screen time she was given. There was only one good "thrilling" scene, which is:<br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />When he's going to snipe the woman who is after him while talking to her on the cell phone.<br /><br />In Supremacy, Jason Bourne seemed to me to be weak, not at smart as he was in the first. It was like he had lost his edge. He wasn't spouting random information, like in Identity. He only REALLY used his lightening fast fighting skills 2 times. And once, that was with a guy who had his hands together. And it still took Jason about 4 minutes to beat the guy. For a while, the handcuffed guy was beating Jason! Had it been in Identity, Jason would've kicked his butt in 5 seconds.<br /><br />This film was a disappointment.</p></body></html>

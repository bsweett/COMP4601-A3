<meta name="summary" content="As a single guy, I rather enjoyed it"></head><body><p>It's a strange thing reviewing a romantic comedy since, as a single guy, it almost defeats the purpose of a movie like this. This was meant to be rented with your significant other, dimmed lights and all, and enjoying it with just the two of you. So can the movie exist for a single person? Possibly. It'll either make you nostalgic for relationships that actually worked, or depressed that you're not in one that idyllic. It's also a bit too much of a movie but at least it's quite charming anyway.<br /><br />Los Angeles film producer Amanda has just thrown out her cheating boyfriend and needs a break. She goes online and finds a unique site: you can swap houses for a couple weeks and you stay at their place and they stay at yours. This is attractive to Iris, England native who has unrequited love for her possessive cad of an ex-boyfriend. They swap houses and pretty soon Amanda strikes a relationship with Iris' brother Graham while Iris meets an aging screenwriting legend and meets Miles, a film composer. Both women get caught up in possible relationships with both aware that their stay isn't permanent.<br /><br />Like in some multiple storyline films, there's always that one that you feel more interested in. For Babel, I was more compelled by the Japanese storyline than anything and the Mexico segments of Traffic were completely better than the rest. Here, I tend to get more interested in the Kate Winslet/Jack Black story simply because Winslet just feels like a more endearing character. I don't think she's ever been this adorable, however the fault comes from the relationship with Black since it develops at an almost slow burn and it just doesn't have the chemistry it needs. The Cameron Diaz/Jude Law story feels the more adult but for some reason I didn't get that drawn into it.<br /><br />2 things bugged me about the film. One, is that there's a bit of pretentious parts in the film, as if writer/director Nancy Meyers wanted to use characters to unleash some Hollywood lowblows such as the old screenwriter (Eli Wallach) lamenting about the age that didn't have DVD, Blockbuster and cineplexes. Then there's the big one where he says outright a film has to "make money on the first weekend or it'll fail". I didn't mind the film professions some of the characters had but to be that nailing on the head just seemed out of place. The other is the length where it just feels too long for a romantic comedy. It helps build films and depth but here it feels almost unneeded.<br /><br />I don't know if it'll work for couples since I watched it as a single guy but taken as such, it's pretty good but probably not really great.</p></body></html>

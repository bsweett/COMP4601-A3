<meta name="summary" content="Neither good nor bad for your eyes"></head><body><p>It's Milla Jovovich kicking tail.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL3A">Yet</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800195175">again</a>, and most likely in the nude at one point.  She plays Violet, a expert killer in middle of a futuristic war between the corporate jerks and the infected jerks she's working with called the Hemophages; she is also a Hemophage, one with the ability change her hair color, control her own gravity, and pulling weapons literally out of thin air (the movie never bothers going into details about those).  Violet was ordered on a mission to apprehend a product, which is actually a boy, and then the woman decided to protect the boy from the people who used to be on her side as well as the corporate jerks who caused her to be infected.  Wait a second...'A female expert assassin had a change-of-heart and wanted to protect a child from people who wanted to kill it or use it?' Oh no, it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P0Y7C">Elektra</a> again.  But unlike the necklace girl from that movie, the boy in "Ultraviolet" knew how to keep his mouth and himself out of trouble.<br /><br />The story tended to borderline between nonsensical and stupid.  Stupidity was given by the enemies, who has the tenacity to wear glass as armor and always charging towards Violet, only to hit each other (what is this, Looney Tunes?). The plot holes are plenty in this film, like why does the big baddie need the boy when he mentioned to have clones of the child or how Violet was rescued that one incident in the park when she's surrounded by enemies?  It was such a rush job, even the visual effects were tacky, especially the glossy backgrounds and that one shot when the entire city is made of blocks (not to mention the wall-riding scene that's straight out of "Night Watch").  For what it's worth, "Ultraviolet" served well enough as popcorn entertainment, albeit a forgettable one. It has some decent fights (bloodless for an Unrated version, though), and I did sorta grew fond of Violet and the boy, even though Violet is basically depicted as a mean, hostile woman.</p></body></html>

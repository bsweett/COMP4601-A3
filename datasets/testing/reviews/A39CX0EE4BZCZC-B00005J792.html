<meta name="summary" content="Very Intriguing Film With Great Ending"></head><body><p>This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it (which is 4 times, so far).  Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.<br /><br />This is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued character, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he's barely audible.<br /><br />But he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen. To explain the story would almost ruin it, because it's preposterous. I'll just call it an interesting fantasy-horror film with a little family story tied in with Willis' wife (Robin Wright) and young boy (Spencer Treat Clark).<br /><br />"Unbreakable" is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. If you're open to try something different, give it a look.</p></body></html>

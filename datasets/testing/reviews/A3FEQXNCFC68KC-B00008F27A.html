When Sam Raimi teams up with Bruce Campbell in what has to be the craziest mix of an entertaining script with a great big heaping scoop of the living dead. Army of Darkness if the third installment of the Evil Dead series and is probably the funnest, and that's saying a lot. The film is rather quirky in its film style, but that's the beauty of it. If you ever wanted to laugh in the face of zombies this is the best place to do it.<br /><br />Although this is a sequel to the previous Evil Dead movies you don't have to worry about not seeing the previous movies. It all ties in quite nicely with a quick little intro, which is all you really need to get back up to speed. Also this one goes into a very different direction in regards to the plot and a lot of the scenes while still giving you a few scenes that feel right at home with those of you who loved the last one. The script is great with some of the best one liners and site gags you can find in movies. Bruce Campbell definitely has made his character, Ash, his own and has taken him to new heights with Army of Darkness.<br /><br />The special effects are decidedly Raimi style with a combination of low budget effects like stop motion and cheap animatronics along with some impressive makeup and practical effects. The thing is they all blend in a very enjoyable way. When a special effect is cheesy Raimi knows how to play it to the hilt and he knows how to make the more refined effects just as outrageous. The movie isn't technically perfect and in a way it seems to revel in it. Little plot holes poke in now and then (like Ash's double barrel shotgun having the ability to shoot more than two shots at a time) but again it feels like they are almost deliberate.<br /><br />If you can watch a horror type movie that is more tongue in cheek than anything else then this is definitely the movie for you. It's very rough around the edges, but in a polished way (confusing eh?). The real trick is you cannot under any circumstances take the movie seriously. The movie doesn't do that and as long as you don't either you should have a blast watching Army of Darkness.</p></body></html>

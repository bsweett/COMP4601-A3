<meta name="summary" content="Not Burton's best, but an enjoyable change-of-pace"></head><body><p>There are a lot of high expectations out there for Tim Burton's newest film, namely because it's getting more Oscar talk than just about any of his movies combined. It's been called his "masterpiece" by some people, but more often than not, it's getting slammed for being uneven. Well, the film is uneven in parts; I'll give you that. As Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), a slowly dying father and husband, ventures back into his past to tell of the outrageous situations into which he got, sometimes that quirkyness seems to hurt things. A few subplots simply border on being ridiculous, and it becomes easy to understand why Finney's thirty-something son resents him so much for feeding him what he considers a line of crap. But then, reader, there are moments in Big Fish (and many of them, at that) when the sun shines through the clouds and you're caught up in the rapturous experience of watching a good narrative. The movie starts off wonderfully, and reaches its pinnacle when the love of Edward's (played in his early years by Ewan McGregor) life enters the picture in a gorgeous moment during a circus. Fish also has some really intelligent things to say about the nature of truth, the bond between fathers and sons, and the legacy of our lives. <p>  The effect of Big Fish upon viewers will be mainly a choice. You won't enjoy the movie if you sit back and agonize over how some of the philosophical notions of Burton's work have been explored much better in other movies; you'll probably roll your eyes at a key scene toward the end that looks like it was lifted out of 8 1/2; and you'll probably know where the whole darn thing is going at points. But you have another option - to sit back and let Burton's own catharsis of the death of his father wash over you in all its flawed, magical glory, and you won't leave dry-eyed. Sure, Big Fish isn't perfect, it is manipulative, and it won't get any Oscars, but it still beats a great deal of 'family' fare out there right now. Look carefully, too, and you'll see Ewan McGregor become a full-blown star. If anything, Big Fish is proof that we'll be seeing more from him in decades to come. Hopefully the same can be said about Fish's eccentric director. Grade: B+</p></body></html>

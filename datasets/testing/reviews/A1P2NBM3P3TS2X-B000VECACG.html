<meta name="summary" content="Looks &amp; sounds great, but Spielberg pulls punches w/extras"></head><body><p>Laserdisc collectors already have the definitive version of this movie courtesy of the Criterion Disc.  Most but not all of those bonus goodies are included here.  The &quot;new&quot; documentary/interview footage is actually a punched-up version of an old one released years ago on Laserdisc.  I still have the Criterion Laserdisc version, and that will be the one I go to when the time rolls around to watch this movie again.  Spielberg did the same thing when he released &quot;Jaws&quot; on DVD in July of 2000.  What should have been a definitive release was instead an abbreviated version (I'm referring to bonus stuff, here) of the edition released as a Collector's set on Laserdisc years before.  What gives, Steve?</p></body></html>

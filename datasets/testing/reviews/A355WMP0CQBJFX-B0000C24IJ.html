<meta name="summary" content="ONE WRONG TURN , ONE NASTY MOVIE!!"></head><body><p>see, these are the reasons you stay away from the woods, the mountains, the backwood town, places you don't know where the hell they're going. one wrong turn might just be one dead end. a young hot group of people, inbred monsters, missing hikers, and nowhere near civilization can make for a very interesting horror flick. not to mention it hits close to reality. you know there's just some kind of stuff like this in the world somewhere. this group gets stranded, they go out to find some help, instead they find a few cannibals. now they have to run for their lives, all of them not making it of course. good story, nice thrills, good actors. eliza dushku, she's a bad girl in this flick. i give her respect, and desmond harrington, man that boy does his thing here. my hero. he manages to keep the light on him. and jeremy sisto, no i didn't like his ending. his acting was good, as always, but he didn't have to go out like that. other than that, enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

But, not if Frankie Dunn has anything to say about it. Spotting her in his gym, Frankie tells Maggie that at her age there is no way that she has a chance (obviously Frankie hasn't watched any of the "Rocky" films).<br /><br />Maggie talks Frankie into being her trainer, telling him that all her life she's been poor "white-trash" and that this is her last ditch effort at doing something, anything with her life. Frankie reluctantly agrees, but, on one condition - Maggie must do everything Frankie teaches her to do & with no "ifs", "ands", or "but's" about it. Over the next four years Maggie trains and becomes a real fighter, but, Frankie is still nervous about her going pro. Reluctantly, again, Frankie makes the descision and lets Maggie go pro. The results are surprising, enthusiastic, and  ultimately tragic.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is one of those films that has points in the film where the director could have taken the film in different & familiar, formulaic directions but doesn't. Before I saw the film, I had heard something of the tragic last-half of "Baby", but, I wasn't told what the tragedy was and exactly where it would be in the film. With that said, there were, for me, a few twists & turns in the film.<br /><br />Hillary Swank is at her best as Maggie & rightfully deserves the Oscar for her portrayal. Eastwood is great as the cranky, crotchety Frankie & you can't help but hear his heart break at the end of the film, when he loses the daughter he found. Eastwood is a Hollywood Legend that will be sorely missed if he retires or, God forbid, passes on.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman turns in, what I hope will be, his most memorable role as one of Frankie's former prize fighters now retired and living & working in Frankie's gym. Freeman's career is rich with different roles that if he were chocalate it would be a mortal sin to eat him.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is one of those films that is a rarity in Hollywood, today. It's worth every well earned penny. This "Baby" is priceless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Comedic Romp"></head><body><p>Considering the state of Hollywood comedies in this day and age, saying that any comedic effort is "decent" is a pretty, well, decent achievement.  While no instant classic, "Hot Tube Time Machine" is most definitely watchable if you are in the mood for something a little different.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this movie sees four pals (John Cusack, Clark Duke, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry) transported to the 1980s (via a hot tub).  While in that decade as their younger selves, the four compadres must both figure out a way back home and navigate the long-ago culture & atmosphere.<br /><br />The most important part of this review is to say that "Hot Tub" does indeed have a tangible plot...separating it from most current comedies.  It isn't just random stoner scenes or all-out raunch.  It is sexually-charged and chock full of profanity, but those elements don't completely obscure a coherent structure and even a few dramatic moments.<br /><br />Besides the period gags, which are usually hilarious, what really makes this movie funny is the acting of those four leading men.  Craig Robinson (Daryl of "The Office" fame) nearly steals the show, while Duke & Robinson also shine in their respective roles.  Cusack, playing the "straight man", is just okay.  Overall, though, the acting is a cut above most idiot comedies.<br /><br />Overall, "Hot Tub Time Machine" is indeed a watchable comedy adventure that will make you chuckle at both the circumstances and the characters.  How many other comedies can you say that about?</p></body></html>

Rather than being a slightly post sell-by date space action flick, it's a spoof in the tradition of Zucker &amp; Abrahams, although the slapstick is very deeply submerged in good old fashioned sci-fi hokum: Planet earth faces a barrage of asteroids being flung at it through hyperspace from a species of arachnids inhabiting a planet the far side of the galaxy, but the humans refuse to conceive that the bugs might be sentient, and (repeatedly) get a good pasting when they arrive to teach the bugs a lesson. The funniest scene is when a starship commander suddenly cottons on that the beams of destructive plasma which keep obliterating her squadron are being deliberately aimed and aren't just random! <p>Along the way we meet a set of bluntly-drawn, wafer-thin  characters who have been sucked into enlisting into the infantry by the propaganda of Verhoeven's trademark all-intrusive Government, who get put through the mill in a terrific send up of the traditional Hollywood boot-camp.<p>The characters are too thin, though, and the film doesn't really work on any level except as a spoof, because you can't identify with - or like - them. Verhoeven toys with the idea of a love triangle, but even he can't be bothered drawing it out, and rather suddenly gives up on it half-way through.<p>Not a bad way to spend a rainy evening, but not likely to go down in the Motion Picture Hall of Fame either.<p>Nice special effects, though.</p></body></html>

Now, Zombie takes one of the all-time classic horror milestones and "re-imagines" it?? WTF?? I figured this would truly be a catastrophic failure! I put off seeing it for a year. Well, I watched HALLOWEEN last night, and couldn't believe how wrong I was! Zombie has not simply rehashed the original, he has recast it in a more modern and psychologically satisfying way. John Carpenter's Michael Myers was perfect for his day (and for any day, really)- a silent, faceless, relentless killing machine, without any personal history. A murderous enigma. Zombie has given Michael motivation and purpose. He has fleshed-out his childhood, much like HANNIBAL RISING did for Lector. I look at Zombie's HALLOWEEN as a seperate and completely different movie from the original. In the same way that I love both the originals and the remakes of DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE HILLS HAVE EYES for example, I can watch and enjoy either HALLOWEEN. Tyler Mane is an awesome, imposing Michael. He seems like he's 9 ft tall! Giving him a back-story did not lessen his horrifying and utterly lethal character. If anything, it added depth to the overall story. Still, either Michael- oldschool or new -is the stuff of wonderful, grisly nightmares...  P.S.- the number of cameos in this movie is wild! Sybil Danning (Reform School Girls)! Clint Howard (Evilspeak)! Ken Foree (Dawn Of The Dead, From Beyond)! Udo Kier (Andy Warhol's Dracula)! Dee Wallace (The Hills Have Eyes, Cujo, The Howling)! And so many more!...</p></body></html>

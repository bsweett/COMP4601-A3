And his constant interjections of "that would NEVER happen" got so annoying that I finally had to say:<br /><br />"Hey, I never went to Weather School but I KNOW that couldn't happen!"<br /><br />My hopes were also high since Michael Crichton's name was on the screenplay.  But then again, so was his wife-at-the-time listed as a screenwriter.<br /><br />But what really got me was that this Hollywood monstrosity had an opportunity to use the best sound and state-of-the-art visual effects to show the raw power and terrifying danger of a real tornado...and they instead chose to pay endless homages to THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Have you ever been in a tornado?  I have.  Nobody's pausing to calmly and safely watch barnyard animals float by.  This movie totally trivialized that stark terror.<br /><br />Whatever tires were on that pick-up truck that Bill Paxton drove around with Helen Hunt and Jamie Gertz had to be magic: somehow houses and tanker trucks could be tossed around like crazy--but not that pick-up truck!<br /><br />Storywise, you can also see everything coming from a mile off.  I'll bet everyone can guess how the relationships will end within the first 20 minutes.  Characters are so broad that I wondered if the two groups of scientists were in this movie or if they were the two competing summer camps in MEATBALLS.  Of course the bad scientists--and they're bad because they drive new black vehicles--are going to suffer the most at the hands of nature.  Of course the leads will have their happy ending.  Of course the tornado will strike the drive-in movie theatre when Jack Nicholson sticks his face through the door in the clip from THE SHINING (I knew that was going to happen as soon as they showed the movie marquee).<br /><br />If this movie had Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay's name in the credits, I wouldn't be able to be so critical.  I just expected more from Michael Crichton.</p></body></html>

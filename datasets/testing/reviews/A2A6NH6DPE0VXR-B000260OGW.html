<meta name="summary" content="Not a fantastic Western but a good one"></head><body><p>Although Open Range isn't the best western I've seen it's still a well made one. The shoot-outs are intense and the scenery is beautiful. Kevin Costner who had shots of himself in pretty much every scene of the Postman shows less ego here. In Open Range it's Robert Duvall who actually gets all the close-ups and good lines. This movie is totally his and Costner seemed to have known that from the start. I mean he pretty much just sits back and lets himself be Duvall's side-kick although he directed the film. He's still good in the movie though. He plays a guy with a dark past who's trying to be a better man. <p>  Costner hits all the right notes as playing that type character here. Some say he's a dull actor but he's just laid-back. He showed me with 3000 Miles to Graceland that he can not only give a fun performance but that he can steal the show if he to as well.  I think he's more engaging when he plays these quiet and hard to figure out guys though, yes even in WaterWorld. Although Duvall steals the show, him and Costner make a great team and Costner proves he's worthy of sharing the same screen as him at least. <p>  Annette Benning who's a fine actress isn't really at her best here though. I guess it's because he part is the least enagining. I mean when 2 friends of Costner and Duvall get wounded she's just there to patch them up. I guess that it's hard to give a women a good role in western though, even one as talented as Benning. Anyway I still liked the movie a lot. It's not up there with Unforgiven, Dances with Wolves or Tombstone but it's still very good. It's Costner's best directed movie since Dances with Wolves.</p></body></html>

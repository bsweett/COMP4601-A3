<meta name="summary" content="THE WAY THE ORIGINAL BRIDGET JONES ENDED - SHE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THESE KIND OF SITUATIONAL COMEDIC PROBLEMS WITH MARK"></head><body><p>IN A NUTSHELL: WE TREAD OVER OLD GROUND: BUT FOR WHAT?<br /><br />We had the impression, based on the well-played characterizations of the first film, that Bridget Jones' life was settled after the original film, "Bridget Jones' Diary". Were we that far off? After all, Mark Darcy just did not seem the type to be suddenly hemming and hawing over whether he was going to make Bridget a permanent fixture in his life. Wasn't that supposed to be settled after he gave up his fiancee in the first film for Bridget?<br /><br />WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS ----<br /><br />Bridget Jones in supersize mode, literally and figuratively. Everything that worked well in the first film seems to be repeated just for the sake of cheap comedy, but at the expense of the plot and the main characters' believability. If there is a difference, it is that Bridget has been changed into a caricature and in the process has lost a great deal of her charm which, of course, is the heart of the film.<br /><br />ABOUT THE LEAD ACTORS: NO SHORTAGE OF TALENT HERE BUT ....<br /><br />With a different Director and four Screenwriters, this sequel seemed bound for failure.<br /><br />Ren&eacute;e Zellweger  - Bridget Jones [nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy]<br /><br />Hugh Grant  - Daniel Cleaver [scene stealing cad]<br /><br />Colin Firth  - Mark Darcy [good guy but too stiff]<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />Excellent transfer of both video and audio. Loads of features, but who cares if the film isn't that compelling?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Worth seeing, but hardly the classic comedy that the original "Bridget Jones' Diary" has become.</p></body></html>

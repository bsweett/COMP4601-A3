<meta name="summary" content="Dream Girls"></head><body><p>Dream Girls  DVD<br /><br />Dream Girls is a musical obviously based on the Supremes and other black vocal artists from that era.  I got James Brown ,but I'm not sure about the others.  Jenifer Hudson plays a young black woman with an attitude and a big voice, could it be that she is a young black woman with an attitude and a big voice.  Maybe she wasn't acting.  I'll hold off in judging her acting abilities until she has a different role.<br /><br />All in all an enjoyable movie.  (I don't typically go in for musicals, but this one is good.<br /><br />Recommended for musical fans who grew up in the 1960's.<br /><br />Gunner, December, 2007</p></body></html>

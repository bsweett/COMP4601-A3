A great story -- a rat (eww!)  who has the talent and the ambition to be a great French chef. Great characters -- a kitchenful of chefs and sous-chefs, each with his or her own quickly-limned personality that is not just an easy caricature of the French. Janeane Garofalo was masterul as the voice of edgy Collette -- the lone female chef who would not be denied here place at the cookstove. Great messages -- 1) that there is such a thing as great cooking, 2) that it's hard but fulfilling to follow your dream and 3) that France is awesome! Add to this great writing, great voices that didn't get in the way of the story and INCREDIBLE animation, and you have the making of a phenomenon.<br /><br />The story of "Ratatouille" is simple -- a rat with an extremely well-developed sense of smell and taste desires to be a French cook. He teams up with the talenteless young son of a great French chef and -- voila! -- they team up to try to fool the most gastronomically picky audience on Earth. Along the way there are betrayals, chases (well, maybe one too many), a love story, a little wine, a little music and a lot of eye-popping visual art. There are scenes where the background is so beautifully rendered that a even a plain stone wall (albeit a Parisian one) is beautiful to watch. The animators expertly captured the sheen of wet rat fur, the swirl of drainage water and the whoosh of a gas flame. The kitchen is so lovingly rendered that after one viewing, you will have it mapped out for the rest of the film. Some scenes are fantastically staged -- as is the first scenes in which Remy, the main rat character, dispenses ingredient after ingredient into a soup. Every spice and vegetable makes it into the pot in a novel way -- whether tossed, dropped, sprinkled or somersaulted in. The planning and creativity that went into this 30-second snippet of film were astounding, and this sort of thing happens over and over. The ending was perfect, pulling victory from defeat in a way that was not bombastic (no one won the Nobel prize) but that nearly brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />"Ratatouille" may be too subtle for really little kids, but I think most 10-year-olds would enjoy it for more than its fast-paced antics. There's a lot to love about this film, and if you don't come away with a burning desire to visit Paris, then there may be no hope for you!</p></body></html>

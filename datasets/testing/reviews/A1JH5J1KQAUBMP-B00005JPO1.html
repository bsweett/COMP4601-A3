<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as "Raiders," but how could it be?"></head><body><p>An older Indy (Harrison Ford) and his companions (Shia Lebeouf, Karen Allen, and John Hurt) are on the trail of a hidden city, where they plan to return a crystal skull to its rightful resting place.  In keeping with the Cold War milieu of the 50s setting, they are pursued by a beautiful Russian military scientist who specializes in psychic research (Cate Blanchett).  This iconic 50s window dressing, along with UFOs, A-bomb tests, McCarthyism, and greasers, adds to the fun of this entertaining movie.<br /><br />A lot of people hate this film, as evidenced by the surprisingly low average rating of 3.5.  I'll admit that I was disappointed, too, but it's probably next to impossible to meet expectations that have been building for nearly twenty years.  Some of the action goes way over the top and the sci-fi elements don't mesh well with the Indy universe, but I'd say that this film still comes out ahead of "Temple of Doom."  I liked the way they handled Indy's age, and it was fun to see Marion Ravenwood return.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A (Government) Star Is Born"></head><body><p>You can take the title of this review in two ways: 1) The star referencing Matt Damon's character portrayal of a government agent so loyal to his country that nothing comes a close second to the duty and honor he serves with. And 2) the star referencing the CIA and literally how it came into existence.<br /><br />I've seen some quotes directly or indirectly suggesting that The Good Shepard is "the best spy movie ever made". That may be true if you like a movie that is as long and wide as its aspect ratio with very little action.<br /><br />And the lack of action was deliberate on DiNiro's part (DiNiro directs and also co-stars). DiNiro is on record in almost every interview about the film as saying that The Good Shepard was more the story of the birth of counter-intelligence than it was a Bond-like action movie with gadgets, car chases and explosions.<br /><br />And indeed a good, interesting story it is. It definitely keeps you interested. The acting is superb. And, sure, there's a little action. But Hollywood lately is self-absorbed with movies that are well over 2 hours, and The Good Shepard's tune could have been named in a lot less than 167 minutes.<br /><br />That's right...2 hours and 47 minutes. I was reminded of this movie the other day as I was walking through the corrals that lead up to the airport security checkpoint....You go back and forth seemingly forever seeing the same people pass you on the left and right a dozen times before you reach your ultimate goal of putting your bag on the X-ray belt and walking through the metal detector with no real sense of joy that you just finished a task that should have taken 5 minutes but took 30 minutes. In The Good Shepard you wait and wait for something to happen seeing the same actors over and over again with very little action and then the movie just ends with no real sense that there was a story that led up to "that climactic moment".<br /><br />So do you want to hurry up and wait to see how the CIA was born? At minimum, it's a well-told story. Ya got a minute...or 167? Give The Good Shepard a large allocation of your time.</p></body></html>

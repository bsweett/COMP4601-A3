<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie with powerful meaning behind it"></head><body><p>I enjoy this movie very much.  The movie was very good and the preformances top notch.  What I enjoy watching the movie over and over again when I am in the mood because there is a spiritual message behind it or meaning behind it.  As a Catholic I have what I believe in and I believe the movie did a good job showing what Emily Rose went through and the impact it can have on a person's life.  Also I like the ending where they show what happened after the trial and that people go to see the grave of Emily Rose as a holy shine.  Just my personal feelings I believe the Devil tempts the strongest of believers to test us and our convictions.  But as for the movie if you want something to watch as both a powerful drama mix with horror scenes then see this movie and see how it impacts you after seeing it. I am sure you will enjoy the movie as much as I have over the past few years.</p></body></html>

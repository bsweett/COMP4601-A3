According to what I had heard, it was far from being a good movie, but I was curious, so I decided to give it a try. A friend had given me the book on which this film is based as a Christmas present, and I decided to read it if the movie had at least something that managed to charm me.<br /><br />Regarding the plot, I suppose I should start by saying that the main character is Eragon (Ed Speleers), a young man that discovers a blue stone he wants to trade for something to feed his family. Unable to do so, Eragon decides to keep the stone, and receives a very big surprise when the stone turns to be a dragon's egg, and he makes the acquaintance of a new friend, a young dragon named Saphira. The birth of Saphira is a powerful magical event noticed by many, among them King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the man that rules Alagaesia the land where Eragon lives.<br /><br /> Galbatorix used to be a dragon rider, but he betrayed the other dragon riders and became a tyrant, ruling his empire with strength and without mercy. From his point of view, Eragon and Saphira are a threat, and they must join him or be wiped out.<br /><br />Galbatorix makes the wrong move, though, and turns Eragon into an enemy. The young man decides to join the Varden, those that oppose the king. With the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an old bard that is a lot more than what he seems to be, Eragon will try to find his path, with Saphira by her side.<br /><br />That sounds interesting and you want to know more? Well, watch the movie. It is not perfect, but it is entertaining, the kind of movie that engages the spectator quickly in the adventures of the main characters, and makes them care. Of course, recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: By the way, after watching this movie I immediately started reading Christopher Paolini's "Eragon", and I loved it. I liked this movie quite a bit (3.5 out of 5 stars), but the book was much better, so if you haven't already read it... What are you waiting for? Go :)</p></body></html>

Murray is as good as he gets, pretty much (though he was often that good in this era---Scrooged, Quick Change, What About Bob?); the script is tight and the premise is brilliant; Andie is at her least annoying; and above all GD is funny as hell at many points.<br />Worth rewatching every few years and/or whenever you need a feel-good romantic comedy.</p></body></html>

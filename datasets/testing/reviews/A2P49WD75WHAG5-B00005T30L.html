<meta name="summary" content="Long live people who can't relate to 99% of humanity!"></head><body><p>From the conspiratory frowns of disdain between Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) at the graduation scene, to when they both give the finger at the graduation sign outside the school, we see that our two heroines are not the typical ordinary Generation Y-ers. Both don't want to go to college like many of their peers. Rebecca at least has some vague idea, such as moving out of her parents' home and saving enough from work to get a place of her own as a first move. She does get a job at a coffee shop, where she learns about customers. "Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody." Sounds like me at work.<p>They spend their first weeks of freedom following people whom Enid thinks might be Satanists, going to Wowsville, "the Taj Mahal of fake 50's diners" complete with a waiter they nickname Weird Al, and make caustic comments about their conformist peers, such as Melorra, a bubbly extraverted dingbat from high school whom they mimic behind her back." With some female cajoling, they get Josh, a guy they like to torment, to drive them places. The note they leave on his apartment door is funny!<p>Their lives begin to diverge when they play a practical joke on Seymour (Steve Buscemi) at Wowsville. They follow him home and later, Enid buys an old blues-country record at his garage sale, of which she's totally enthralled by Skip James' "Devil Got My Woman." From then on, she hangs with him, slowly pushing Rebecca to the sidelines.<p>Seymour's a reclusive eccentric, collecting memorabilia from the 1930's and 1940's. Like Enid, he isn't comfortable with mainstream life. "I can't relate to 99% of humanity." he tells her, to which she replies, "I can't relate to humanity either but it's not completely hopeless." His statement of not being in the same universe rang a chord inside me. Another time, he asks her, "You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? [You] can't connect with other people so you fill your life with...I'm just like all these other collector losers." Fits me to a tee.<p>Enid (with her ever-changing glasses) really has a blast at Anthony's, an adult shop, laughing and pointing at the paraphernalia inside, much to the discomfort of the other shoppers.  And check out that sexy leopard mini and black blouse she's wearing.  Rowr!<p>Brilliant dialogue peppers this gem of a movie. Enid uses her usual sarcasm on her job at the theatre, to a popcorn customer who wants extra butter: "Smothered in delicious yellow chemical sludge." Seymour makes a commentary on racism in America: "People still hate each other, they just know how to hide it better."<p>At the high school graduation we first see Enid in her red gown. She's also dressed in red at the end of the movie, coming full circle, meaning, that yes, she has gone through a lot during the few months after high school, but in a sense, she's still where she is, alienated by the rest of society.<p>Contrary to what I've heard or read, Scarlet Johannsson makes an excellent compliment to Thora Birch. She's more reserved and more knowing on what's expected of her now. Thora Birch is a marvel as Enid, unsure what she wants, as she undergoes a transition period that takes her into the unknown. However, Steve Buscemi's Seymour made me think, "Is this really the same guy who was Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs and that guy 'who was funny-looking in a general sort of way' in Fargo? WOW!"<p>So for those of you who don't relate to the rest of humanity in a major way, whose disillusioned lives are full of enlarged holes and tight cracks, this movie's especially for you.</p></body></html>

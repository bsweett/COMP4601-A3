<meta name="summary" content="Brutal And Fantastical--"></head><body><p>A few weeks ago, as I was wrapping up 2006, I looked back on the films that I had seen and proclaimed "United 93" as my personal choice for best film of the year.  While that film's message resonates on a primal and emotional level for most viewers, I think it's easy to forget that it is also great filmmaking.  The choices Paul Greenglass makes, the lack of "character" development, the mundane real-time documentary feel--these unconventional technical elements combine to form a powerful and relevant film (even without the political undertones of the actual event).  Another film that capaitalizes on its technical merits and combines them (albeit in a very different way) with politics and a heartrending story is "Pan's Labyrinth."  A film that impressed me on every level, involved me, and moved me in surprising ways--I now have to admit that I was premature with my "best film" choice.  So let me revise.  "Pan's Labyrinth" now stands side by side with "United 93" as my personal favorite for 2006.<br /><br />The beauty of Guillermo del Toro's "Pan's Labyrinth" can be defined in many ways.  First and foremost, though, I'd have to single out the complexity of the storytelling.  This Spanish film can be appreciated as a child's fantasy, or a look at fascism and rebellion, or an intense and harrowing family drama, or a horror movie, or a study of the nature of violence.  Interweaving different components that should not work together, del Toro has crafted a singularly unique film that takes risks.  This adult fable expertly combines vicious and graphic brutality with the wonderment and fantasy of childhood.  Like nothing you've seen before, "Pan's Labyrinth" is an artistic marvel.  The narrative is enhanced by a beautiful score, tremendous effects, wonderful art direction and cinematography.<br /><br />The plot of "Pan's Labyrinth" follows 12 year old Ofelia, who relocates with her pregnant mother to the home of her new stepfather in the Spanish countryside.  A Fascist officer near the end of World War II, the stepfather is on assignment to oust the rebels from the hills surrounding the estate.  Ofelia, obsessed with fairy tales, becomes caught up in a fantastical underground world where she is a princess and must undertake various missions to help reclaim the kingdom.  The story of the Officer's indifference and contempt for Ofelia while her mother endures a difficult pregnancy provides strong domestic drama, scenes of the Officer's confrontations and torture of the rebels provides harrowing intrigue and action, and Ofelia's underground caverns provides horror and wonder and one of the most expertly crafted "fantasy" worlds depicted on film.<br /><br />All of the actors are wonderful, and their contributions should not be overlooked.  The actress who portrays Ofelia, in particular, carries a heavy burden--but pulls off the complexity of the varying storylines.  Amazingly, any of the individual story threads would make a great film on its own--each is developed and has real emotional consequence.  But by putting them together with such effectiveness, del Toro has created his masterpiece--bold, unconventional, thrillingly different.  "Pan's Labyrinth" is nominated for screenplay and 4 technical Oscars and is the likely winner of Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.  But winning awards is nothing new for this incredible film.  Already recognized internationally by many, many countries--"Pan's" was also this country's National Society Of Film Critics choice for Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />I was thrilled by "Pan's" filmmaking, but more importantly I was moved by its story and performances.  My highest recommendation, "Pan's Labyrinth" is a film I will cherish and remember.  KGHarris, 01/07.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="entertaining enough"></head><body><p>though i did enjoy this dramatic action thriller,i thought it was missing something.there was drama,to be sure,and plenty of action.but it was not as thrilling as i had hoped or expected.there was enough tension to keep me watching,but none of the 'edge of your seat 'or nerve shredding intensity.it wasn't boring,by any means but compared to the tension in Crimson Tide,for instance(also directed by Tony Scott)there was no comparison.Scott really reigned himself in here(which he usually has trouble doing(see Domino)but in this case,he could have let loose a bit.still,the movie was entertaining enough.for me,Unstoppable is a 3/5</p></body></html>

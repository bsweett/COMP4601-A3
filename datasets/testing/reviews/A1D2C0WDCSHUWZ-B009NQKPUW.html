This sorta-kinda-maybe prequel to the "Alien" franchise raises a lot of scientific/philosophical questions and never really answers them. But if you can bypass that, it's still a very solid, harrowing sci-fi adventure, with some powerful lead performances and truly brilliant direction by Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient star maps that may lead to the Engineers, aliens responsible for making the human race. So with the funding of elderly bazillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), they set out to a remote moon on board the Prometheus.<br /><br />Upon landing, the crew finds a vast torc-shaped spaceship, filled with the dead bodies of Engineers. But there is also a bizarre black liquid that ravages anyone who is exposed to it -- and leaves Shaw threatened by a bizarre alien life form. As she discovers the ugly true reason behind the expedition, she also finds that the Engineers are not what she expected...<br /><br />"Prometheus" can be kind of frustrating -- it has a lot of unanswered questions and dangling plot threads, and eventually it makes you feel like it's the first half of a two-part story. And there's a lot of scientific/philosophical/religious stuff that is lightly touched on, but isn't really handled in an insightful way (although it was nice to see a scientist who is also religious).<br /><br />But despite those flaws.... "Prometheus" is actually a really enjoyable movie. There's a lot of passion and earnest intensity to this movie, and it was clearly made with a lot of love.<br /><br />And Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely brilliant -- he interweaves slimy tentacled horror with sleek, shadowy sci-fi, until they are indistinguishable from each other. Everything grows more intense as the black liquid starts mutating the crew members, until the climax explodes into a chaos. Things just spiral more and more out of control, and you never quite know what's going to happen.<br /><br />You also wouldn't recognize Rapace as the girl with the dragon tattoo here -- she's elfin and luminous, with enormous expressive eyes and a mop of rumpled hair. She handles the role of Shaw beautifully -- a person who is deeply religious but also devoted to science, extremely intellectual but also very strong (particular in the... um, medical procedure scene).<br /><br />She's also flanked by awesome performances by the icy, rigid Charlize Theron and the pleasant, charming Idris Elba. But the scene-stealer is Fassbender, who plays a charming, elegant android who occasionally shows some flickers of human emotion. At times he seems soulless and cold, but then we see him watching his favorite movie or asking questions about faith.<br /><br />"Prometheus" is a riveting sci-fi story, albeit a flawed one that never answers most of our questions. Here's hoping "Prometheus 2" is a bit more satisfying.</p></body></html>

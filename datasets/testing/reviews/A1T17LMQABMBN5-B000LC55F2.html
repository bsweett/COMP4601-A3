<meta name="summary" content="Truly magical!"></head><body><p>There are many reviews here that have so eloquently explained why this film is a must-see, but I have to share my enthusiasm nevertheless.  The Prestige is a dark and intense gothic thriller set during the turn of the twentieth century and it tells the story of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two struggling magicians who turn against each other after a magic trick goes wrong, costing the life of Angier's wife.  Angry, Angier tries every way to outdo Borden in magic tricks and fame.  His motive is revenge at first, but then it takes a life of its own when discovering Borden's secrets and tricks become an obsession.  There are many twists throughout the film, which include some rather flooring scenes.<br /><br />I loved this film and its dark tone from beginning to end.  It isn't the typical thriller by any means, for it's got substance mostly brought on by the excellent direction of Christopher Nolan and the magnificent performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine.  Christian Bale is by far the best in this film.  He brings Borden's many complexities to life and he does leave you puzzled with his behavioral changes and hard-to-figure-out personality.  His performance floored me.  I've never seen this actor in a film before, and in addition to his good looks and gorgeous Welsh accent, I enjoyed his delivery and I look forward to watching him in other films.  Jackman surprised me here.  I'd seen him in romantic comedies and in those Van Helsing and X-Men movies and thought that was all he was capable of doing, but his stellar performance here has proven me wrong.  Plus, he looks gorgeous.  I cannot resist a tall, dark and handsome man in a cravat.  There are other fine performances here, one of them by David Bowie, who plays the legendary Victorian scientist Nikola Tesla.  The weakest link, acting-wise, is Scarlett Johansson, who uses one of the worst imitations of an English accent I've ever heard.  As for other aspects, the characterization Angier, Borden and the others is flawless.  The majority of the characters, namely the protagonists, are not meant to be sympathetic.  In fact, they are flawed, unlikeable people who are selfish and sinister in more ways than one.  (Though I admit I felt bad for Angier because he was so tortured and corrupted with obsession that I truly felt for the character.) That is what makes this film dark in a rather unique way. I love the cinematography, the late 19th Century England setting, and the overall dark plot.  This, as I and others have already said, is a must-see.  I watched this on iTunes and bought the DVD afterwards because I couldn't get enough and because this is the sort of movie you have to watch a few times in order to fully understand it.  I've watched it twice already and discovered things I hadn't noticed at first.  I wish I had read the book this film is based on before watching the movie.  Ah, well.  Anyway, this is highly recommended.</p></body></html>

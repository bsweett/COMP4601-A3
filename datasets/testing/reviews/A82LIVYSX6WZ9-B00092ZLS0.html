<meta name="summary" content="Hide and Seek is neither fun nor scary...just plain dumb"></head><body><p>Robert De Niro (Meet The Fockers, Meet The Parents) brings his daughter, Dakota Fanning (the upcoming War Of The Worlds, Man On Fire) to a uptsate country house after Fanning's mother takes her own life. Soon after they move in Fanning starts to tell her dad of her imaginary friend named Charlie. De Niro starts to become more and more worried about his daughter and strange things happen. The end is another one of those twist endings we all love....sometimes. I think De Niro and Fanning did a good job though this movie is neither scary nor suspenseful...it has its moments. Also starring Elisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas, The Saint), Dylan Baker (Changing Lanes, Along Came A Spider), Robert John Burke (Fled), Amy Irving (13 Conversations About One Thing, Tv's Alias) and Famke Janssen (X-Men 1 and 2, GoldenEye).</p></body></html>

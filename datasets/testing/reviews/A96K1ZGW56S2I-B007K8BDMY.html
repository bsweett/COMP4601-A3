I didn't recognize who "Timothy Treadwell" was and I don't think I had ever herd of Werner Herzog before (when I first saw the movie I almost fainted because I thought the former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals had made this film).  After seeing the movie, I remembered that I had seen Treadwell before when he had appeared on television and I was corrected about the mistaken identity of the director.  After viewing the movie, I was flabbergasted.  It honestly is one of the most well-done documentaries about a person that I have ever seen.<br /><br />GRIZZLY MAN is a movie about the life of Timothy Treadwell.  Treadwell had performed several odd jobs during his life, but worked largely as an actor.  At one point in his life he was one of two finalists for the role of "Woody" on "Cheers", but lost out to Woody Harrelson.  Afterwards, Treadwell's life went downhill for awhile until he discovered (or perhaps it was rediscovered) nature.  I don't remember if GRIZZLY MAN explains how Treadwell became infatuated with grizzly bears, but he did.  He began sneaking into a protected (and dangerous) area of Alaska to hang out with the grizzlies.  He filmed many of these moments and must have believed himself to be a Steve Irwin of the grizzly bears.  However, unlike Steve Irwin, Timothy Treadwell was not a trained naturalist, zoologist, and biologist.  He hung out with the bears and thought they liked him; he believed he was one of them and he thought they did, too.  The locals believed Treadwell was crazy and that the only reason the bears didn't harm him was because they could sense he was crazy.  Treadwell was tragically killed in 2003 with his girlfriend by a grizzly bear.  It was a bear he was not familiar with and one that had traveled far south in search of food.<br /><br />Considering the material that GRIZZLY MAN was based, the film could have turned out terribly.  In lesser hands the life of Treadwell might have been parodied and his life made to be a joke.  Herzog does not do that.  Instead, using interviews and footage that Treadwell shot himself, he presents a very revealing, compassionate, and moving film that captures the best and worst of Treadwell's life.<br /><br />Documentaries are not for everyone, but this is one documentary that I highly recommend that just about anyone can enjoy.  It is a fascinating picture about an eccentric and captivating man.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best horror film of the last ten years, arguably."></head><body><p>28 Days Later... (Danny Boyle, 2002)<p>28 Days Later... immediately establishes two things: first, that Alex Garland's screenplays are equally as brilliant as his novels (and, as a sidelight, that Danny Boyle letting John Hodge adapt Garland's luscious novel The Beach was an even worse crime than we first thought). Second, that Danny Boyle, given a script with an actual plot, a goal, and enough meat is, in fact, capable of making a good movie.<p>Hot on the heels of these revelations, as I sat through the film for the second time on Sunday afternoon (and this is the first film I have gone to see twice on opening weekend in over a quarter of a century), I realized why the Hollywood machine will never, ever be able to make a film even remotely resembling 28 Days Later.... But more on that, well, later.<p>There has been a good deal of criticism about this movie, and it doesn't surprise me in the least. England has long been the bastion of low-budget horror that achieves a kind of brilliance 28 Days Later... reminded me most in critical reaction of another low-budget horror film from England twenty years ago called XTRO. XTRO is unimaginably brilliant, but like 28 Days Later..., it's not structured like your normal horror film; you get hit with a brick wall at the beginning of the film, and you get hit with a brick wall at the end of the film. The middle contains a few jumps, but is mostly concerned with building plot, characterization, and mystery. (More mainstream filmgoers should be recognizing the pacing by now-the same type of structure was used in both Ringu and Saving Private Ryan.) In other words, it's bound to alienate both the "regular" American horror film fan, who's used to the "scares" coming thick and fast throughout, and the "cerebral" American horror fan, who's used to getting his disturbances from the creep factor and not the gore factor. And to be honest, I'm surprised the film's audiences have been as large as they have (it landed solidly in fourth place this week, behind three films which all were playing at over twice the number of screens). It's almost enough to get me to write Harry Bromley Davenport and tell him that now's the time to re-release XTRO on the big screen. It might have finally found its audience.<p>Aside from the excellent performances (main characters Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris, and Harris wonderful turns by Boyle regular Christopher Eccleston, the excellent and highly underrated Brendan Gleeson, and Megan Burns), much has been made of Boyle's use of digital photography to shoot the film. Good idea, indeed. The whole thing comes up with an odd quality that is both documentary (zombies in flames can almost be smelled in the theater) and surreal (as Murphy and co. are driving by a field of rotting roses, a guy behind me asked, "is that a painting?"). The film is also layered in its presentation, as any good zombie film since the seventies has been; it asks all the questions a zombie film should ask and still manages to make them come off sounding like we haven't heard them before. Boyle has finally found the right film to posit his seeming deep loathing of the human race, which he attempted to bring to the forefront of both Trainspotting and The Beach without a shred of success. Here, it comes through with crystal clarity. <p>What should have emerged from this review is, overall, a single word: different. This is not your mindless summer blockbuster. This is a film that will make you think, require repeated viewings to catch things you missed the first time, stick in your head long after it's over (probably longer than you want it to), and above all will make you uncomfortable. (And not just with horror; the gore factor is far more suggested than explicit. It's little things like Cillian Murphy's first appearance in the movie being a full-frontal nude shot, which had murmurs of discomfort going through the audience. "We didn't need to see that," the guy behind me said. Yeah, we DID. That's the whole point.) And that was what hit me, when not long after my second viewing I found myself listening, somewhat revolted, to songs on the radio by the winners of American Idol. I loathe the show, and could never really figure out why until then. America, when given the choice, will vote for sameness every time. Reuben and Kelly do not sound markedly different than anything else you're likely to hear on your local soft rock station. And most of the films you're likely to see this summer are not markedly different than those you saw last summer. And 28 Days Later... is above all different. You may have seen every film which is paid homage by various scenes here (and you will likely get more out if it if you've at the very least seen A Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, Platoon, XTRO, most importantly The Omega Man, and probably fifteen to twenty other movies that aren't coming to mind right now), but you've still never seen it done quite like this.<p>All that said, 28 Days Later... is not a great film. It's a very good one, but not a great one. Boyle isn't flaunting the genre's conventions enough to cross the line into true greatness, and there are things about the movie which give away Boyle as a novice horror director (for example, we don't get much information about Rage, but we get too much early to achieve the spooky ambience of Carpenter's The Fog, without getting a full explanation by the end to really drive the horror home, like in Poltergeist). Still, so far it's a shoo-in to make the year's ten best. ****</p></body></html>

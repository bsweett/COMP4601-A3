<meta name="summary" content="A very enjoyable, solid film"></head><body><p>This is not going to be remembered as one of the greatest films in the careers of any of the main folks involved (with the exception of Christopher Walken, who has rarely been better), but it is nonetheless an excellent if unspectacular movie.  Leonard DiCaprio is excellent in a complex and well acted role.  Tom Hanks is solid as always, although his faux-Boston accent is a tad grating at times.  John Williams has produced a score that is more subtle than his usual efforts, and quite effective in setting the mood for the various scenes.  And Steven Spielberg does his usual highly professional job of directing.  The film fails to be anything especially thrilling, but I can't imagine many people claiming that watching it was a waste of time.  <p>I loved the period feel of the film.  Most of the decor felt just right.  At no point was it anything less than a joy to behold<p>The only problem with the film is that in the end, it just isn't very memorable.  I loved the performances, I loved the set and art design, I loved the score.  But I felt far less moved by the film than I would have anticipated.  Still, one could hardly go wrong by taking the time to see this highly polished, professional effort.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MILLENIUM EDITION IS THE BEST DVD SO FAR!!"></head><body><p>This review is mostly for the dvd. I don't think i have to mention hwo good the movie is because everyone knows its a classic horror film. Anyway, many people are always confused on whether which version to get. There are so many out there it is frustrating. But let me re-assure you night of the living dead fans that the Millenium Edition is the way to go. First off, You finally get to see the original classic in the most clear and amazing dvd transfer ever. Great sound, no dark or muddy looking scenes. Everything is crystal clear. The Anchor Bay versions out there are garbage, they added all these un-edited and terrible scenes. They just ruin the classic, don't waste your money on the 30th anniversary edition or limited edition. Pure TRASH! The bonus material on the millenium edition is also better, an interesting interview with Duane Jones, two insightful commentaries, some of George A. Romero's lost films including &quot;NIGHT OF THE LIVING BREAD&quot;. My only problem with this dvd is that they should of added a nice long documentary on this classic film. Other than that it is the best version out there!!</p></body></html>

He takes her under his wing and grooms her for corporate greatness. Later it looks like someone has bumped off Laura. Detective Lt. Mark McPherson is assigned to the case. Somewhere in the process of investigation he seems to have fallen in love with the dead Laura and wants to buy her portrait.<br /><br />Can we figure out who did it before Mark?<br /><br />This movie is all that they say it in and then some. Naturally it is not the book "Laura" by Vera Caspary. And due to media constraints some things are implied. The characters do not match the book description.<br /><br />They could not get a good portrait of Gene Tierney for the picture of Laura so they used a photograph and made it look like a portrait. I wonder where that photograph is today.<br /><br />First time viewing gives you the impression that Waldo Lydecker, is the manipulative person. Yes I know most of the characters are manipulative in nature. But second time viewing, low and behold; who manipulates Waldo from the very beginning and uses his connections to clime the corporate latter? Then pretty much snubs him.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Vincent price play a character (Shelby Carpenter) that is not in a spook movie.<br /><br />Look how confident Dana Andrews as Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, is in this movie. Also notice his high heal shoes. See him as a completely different character in "In Harm's Way" (1965), as Admiral 'Blackjack' Broderick. Also directed by Otto Preminger.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALVQ">The Razor's Edge</a></p></body></html>

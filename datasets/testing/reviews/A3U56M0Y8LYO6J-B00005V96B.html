That's too bad because the film does an admirable job of creating two very distinct and entertaining lead characters. Unfortunately, they were not given a quality story to occupy.<br /><br /> The city of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of children. Because the supply of screams is dwindling, a major energy crisis is inevitable. James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman), the leading scream producer in the city, is assigned the task of remedying the problem. Seemingly up to no good is co-worker Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), an opportunistic rival who has his sights set on becoming the scream collecting champion. Boggs, however, becomes the least of Sulley's problems when a human child named Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) accidentally crosses over to Monstropolis. With the help of his pal, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal), Sulley must hide Boo from the other monsters and figure out a way to return her back to her world.<br /><br /> The problem with "Monster's, Inc." is that it starts out brilliantly and then rapidly dissolves into the routine. At the outset, the premise of the story is firmly established and some clever visual gags are thrown in to further amuse. The opening sequence is an energetic tip-of-the-hat to the Kobayashi Maru training sequence in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" (1982). This reference is then followed by a re-do of the slow-mo walk from the "The Right Stuff" (1983) and a tribute to special effects innovator Ray Harryhausen, which includes an Octopus homage to "It Came from Beneath the Sea" (1955). However, the level of sophistication in "Monster's, Inc." then takes a nosedive - the wink to Chuck Jones' "Feed the Kitty" (1952) notwithstanding - and the rest of the film stoops to the level of generic Saturday-morning entertainment. Sadly it appears that the creators felt that they could just coast on the appeal of the Sulley and Mike characters for the entire second half. The voicework is of top quality with Goodman, Crystal, Buscemi, Gibbs, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, and Bonnie Hunt turning in great efforts. Yet, while "Monster's, Inc." is a technical marvel and a tribute to some talented animators, it ultimately disappoints because of its failure to maintain the momentum of its great beginning.</p></body></html>

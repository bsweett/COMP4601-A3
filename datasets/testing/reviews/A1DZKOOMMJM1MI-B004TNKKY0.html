<meta name="summary" content="A fantastic trilogy!!!!"></head><body><p>Anyone who's not a fan of the 'Back to the Future' trilogy should be locked up for some sort of treason to the world of entertainment. Though the first movie is the only one which can be said to stand alone as a whole story, it's when the three of them are put together as one complete adventure that things really get good. In fact, everyone should make a point of watching all three 'Back to the Future' movies in a back-to-back marathon at least once in their lives. Allow the occasional toilet break, of course, but no more than that.<p>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd stars as the troublesome teen and madcap scientist who do their time-travelling in style, courtesy of a revamped DeLorean. Their adventures over the course of the three incredible movies take them from 1985, to 1955, back to 1985, on to 2015, 1985 again(!), 1955 again(!!) and the wild wild west of 1885 (!!!) before returning home to 1985 in time for tea and a couple of Huey Lewis tracks. It features quite possibly the only sequel ever in which a large chunk takes place within its own predecessor, and definitely the only trilogy to feature Christopher Lloyd leaping around the outside of a moving train rescuing a damsel in distress. Lea Thompson, the brilliant character actor Crispin Glover, Elisabeth Shue, Billy Zane and the marvelous Thomas F. Wilson are among the other members of a fine supporting cast. And is that really Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers popping up as squeaking bad boy Douglas J. Needles? Yup, that's right , something for everyone!<p>Go out, buy this collection, watch it repeatedly and, when you're not watching, keep the three discs in a glass display case which only very special friends are invited round to see. At this price, there are NO excuses. Do it now. Right now. Go. You'll thank me later, why are you still here?</p></body></html>

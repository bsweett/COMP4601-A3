<meta name="summary" content="Ultimate Mob Movie"></head><body><p>This has been, and still is, one of my all time favorite movies.  I don't think any mob movie can compare.  I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story of the Corleone family's struggle for complete power.  All of the characters are so well done, especially Michael, played by Al Pacino.  This movie is very well done, setting the scene from the 1950 up until the 1970's.  This is a great movie.</p></body></html>

I was eager to find out why these books have been so lauded but the question is was I left disappointed by the experience?<br /><br />The film follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) who is sentenced to three months in prison after losing a libel case against the industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Stefan Sauk). Blomkvist is unaware he being watched by a troubled 24-year old hacker, Lisbeth (Noomi Rapace), who concludes her assignment when Blomkvist is imprisoned but continues to monitor his activities especially the files in his computer. Blomkvist is hired by an industrialist Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, four decades ago on Children's Day in 1966. Blomkvist is invited to stay with the Vanger family at their remote estate and begins piecing together the few clues that were ever found concerning the missing Harriet. Henrik Vanger believes someone in the Vanger family was responsible for Harriet's disappearance but as Blomkvist digs deeper his path crosses with Lisbeth who draws on all her resources to help him solve the mystery but both journalist and hacker find themselves in the firing line of watching assailants who have secrets they wish to keep buried.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has two interesting main characters. Blomkvist's career is in tatters after his stint in jail and his prospects and reputation for the future does not look good. Despite his problems, Blomkvist does find work investigating the disappearance and suspected murder of Harriet Vanger whose image appears hauntingly throughout the film, a photo of a teenage girl full of smiles despite the sinister secrets beneath the facade of the rich and successful Vanger family. In contrast to Blomkvist is the striking Lisbeth whose past is a painful one, revealed slowly to us as the film progresses. Lisbeth has to report to a probation guardian for regular meetings and at the outset she has a new guardian, Bjurman (Peter Andersson), who takes charge of Lisbeth's finances and distributes her funds only in exchange for sexual favours. Lisbeth may seem an unfortunate victim of this depraved bully but she is resourceful and strong when backed into a corner. Her revenge against her oppressor is less brutal than what he inflicts on her but it is more than satisfying watching Bjurman squirm as Lisbeth reclaims control of her money and leaves him weeping and permanently scarred.<br /><br />The mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance is an intriguing one. The clues investigated by Blomkvist and Lisbeth include names and numbers in Harriet's Bible that the police and Blomkvist cannot unravel but Lisbeth is able to decode the sequence very quickly. However, the most striking and unnerving evidence in the film is photographs of Harriet at the Children's Day Parade standing seemingly happy when her eyes focus on an unseen person in the crowd and immediately she walks away clearly frightened. Blomkvist and Lisbeth are certain Harriet is looking at her killer but when they do get an image of the figure she's looking at it is too blurred for an identification to be made. From this disappearance and suspected murder, Blomkvist and Lisbeth unravel a series of unsolved murders that took place more than 40 years ago but as they get closer to the truth things start to become perilous. Blomkvist is shot at while out jogging and members of the Vanger family persistently warn him to leave, keeping us guessing as to who the killer is.<br /><br />Sexual violence is a prominent theme in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and some of the scenes, though often implied, may still be too much for some audiences. If you can overcome these aspects though this is always a fascinating and tense thriller which never seems too long despite being two and a half hours. Nyqvist and Rapace are both excellent as the film's leads, the latter in particular brings a multitude of emotions to the character of Lisbeth, the seemingly fragile victim of sadistic men but deep down an independent and strong-willed woman. Both Mrs B and I couldn't help but laugh when Lisbeth climbed into bed with a surprised Blomkvist and after the couple had sex she leaped straight out of bed and bid him goodnight, the confused journalist having served his purpose! As for the murder mystery of Harriet Vanger, well, that is left till the very end and it's a difficult one to unravel with the ending equally surprising and brilliant.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent murder mystery thriller that remains dark and tense throughout its duration. Boasting a terrific cast, a clever plot and many memorable scenes I'd highly recommend seeing this. As good as Hollywood's take may be I cannot see it topping this version.</p></body></html>

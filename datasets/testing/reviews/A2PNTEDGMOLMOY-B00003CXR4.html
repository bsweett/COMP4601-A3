These talented actors say all there is to say with meaningful glances, conveying their mixed emotions of desire and regret.  (The dialogue is also surprisingly good for a "kung fu flick," but is much more effective in Chinese with Engish sub-titles rather than dubbed in English.)<p>Still, this movie is first and foremost a martial arts film -- albeit one with a heck of a love story.  Two fight scenes in particular - an early one at night in a courtyard and a later scene in a sparring room - steal the entire movie.  World-class athleticism combined with astounding choreography and a heart-pounding soundtrack -- sheer bliss!  <p>"Crouching Tiger" gives us heroes to cheer, villains to hiss, and colorful sidekicks to make us smile.  Put this all together with stunning camerawork and a heart-breaking climax, and you've got yourself one heck of a picture!  <p>The only criticism of the DVD is the relative paltry offering of extras.  But I'd rather have a great film with few extras than a mediocre film with a ton of goodies on the DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Depression Rocky"></head><body><p>Not since Rocky has such a gritty look at a poor family and a underdog becoming a hero been seen. What made Rocky great was Stallone had a shoestring budget that required the best for the least and a knack for making a great story breath life. The superb acting, story, music, and sets make Cinderella Man come to life. If you liked Rocky or any other movies that have realistic people you should enjoy this one. Once again Crowe comes through with a splendid job of acting. The support cast has some notables that give the feeling of real people that lived through the depression. Be ready with some tissues for this one. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

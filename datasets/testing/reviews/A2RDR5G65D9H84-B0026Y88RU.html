<meta name="summary" content=""This is a Kansas City shuffle. They look right and you...go left""></head><body><p>After hearing from friends and reading about this movie being associated with Tarantino's work, I promised to myself I would not go for that comparison in my review. Well...maybe promise is too strong a word. There is nothing I can do, because the film is exactly, and I mean exactly, the type of production you would associate with the creator of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558908242">Pulp Fiction</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HC2LEY">Reservoir Dogs</a>. And to tell you the truth, those two films are a very good benchmark, if you liked them, you will definitely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />There is one aspect of the film that is going to put some people off right away: the non-linear plot. If you enjoy a film in which the different scenes have a clear relationship to each other, you may want to skip this one. However, if you have a good time with movies that give you what seem like unrelated tidbits of action, until these are connected towards the end, it is time to check cell number 1. Cell number 2 relates to violence, and this film has a pretty good amount of the vicious type of it, accompanied by loud sound effects. In this sense, once again, think "Pulp Fiction" and if you are good with that experience, you get to check cell 2. Finally, we get to a more common ground among viewers; those that like surprising twists in the plot and unexpected connections among characters that make you go "Aha!", which I think is the majority of people, can check cell 3.<br /><br />After you get your three checks, add on top of that some really great performances by an all-star cast, and great music Tarantino-style (sigh, I did it again), and you have the full package. Now sit back and enjoy, just as I did.</p></body></html>

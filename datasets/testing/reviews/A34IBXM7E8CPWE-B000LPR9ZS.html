This was a similar tactic used in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, what was not seen seemed so much worse. With Saw 2, things took a little more graphic turn, there was still a nice twist ending, and the story wasn't as heavy handed, there was a "fun" element to the story. Saw 3 cranks up the gore, and slaps the viewer with a heavy, very melancholy storyline. Saw 3 is so depressive, there is really no one to cheer for, you really don't care who lives or dies as there is really no character development, and the two new main characters/victims are so unlikable you begin to lose interest. While I agree Saw 3 wraps up loose ends from Saw 2, it ends up presenting so many new questions that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Now you will have to see part 4 when it comes out to see how the storyline of part 3 wraps up. I don't care any longer, I am done playing Jigsaw's game. Unless your idea of entertainment is seeing broken bones being pushed through the skin, or toolbox brain surgery, stay away from this bloody mess of a film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="STAR TREK:  THE MOTION PICTURE"></head><body><p>Sadly, this first entry in the Star Trek feature film series is less than the sum of its parts.  Despite the reunion of the classic TV series' original cast, augmented by a pair of talented guest stars, the guiding hands of series creator Gene Roddenberry and legendary director Robert Wise, a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith, and a story concoted by great sci-fi author Alan Dean Foster, the film never rises above the mediocre.  The biggest flaw is the pacing, as exemplified by the absurdly long introduction of the Enterprise in spacedock, and the ship's later meandering journey through the internal world of V'ger.  The FX and sets are impressive, but never inspiring.  The script is built on an interesting premise, but one which never comes to life and finally disintegrates in a melodramatic but unmoving anti-climax.  The best parts of this film are the Mr. Spock subplot (in which the Vulcan sees V'ger as a kindred spirit and potential mentor), and the opening segment depicting V'ger's skirmish with a trio of Klingon battle cruisers.  There are worse films, even in the Star Trek saga (notably Generations), but this movie will probably only appeal to die-hard Trekkies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Horrendous."></head><body><p>This movie, while being a film from the great Stanley Kubrick, is nothing short of horrible. While containing small aspects of what the book wished to convey, there is nothing believable about this movie, unlike the totally  engrossing novel. This movie tends more to concentrate on the effects of  blood and gore, showing scenes of two little girls' chopped up bodies, Jack  sinking an axe into Halloran's heart (VERY GRAPHIC), and a possessed Danny  who talks to his finger in a voice that seems to come straight from the  catacombs of hell. Maybe that is what Mr. Kubrick wished to convey, but it  certainly does not do justice to the brilliant novel. Even the room that  Danny is warned about, Room 217 in the book, is changed to 237 in the  movie. WHY? And what is with that stupid maze thing in the garden? It makes  no sense to me. This movie as a whole doesn't make sense, but then we soon  forget that Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut, made no sense either. This  is not a movie for fans of the novel, and if you want a movie that follows  the novel, then try to find the 1997 miniseries starring Rebecca de Mornay  and Steven Weber. That's the best.</p></body></html>

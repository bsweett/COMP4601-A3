Not the best when it comes to family entertainment.<br /><br />The CGI is great (especially with the details in it) The casting is ok. A lot of good names. The problem is the plot. It's boring and has no bunch. The jokes are lame (maybe because I'm not 10) While other movies have jokes for parents and kids, this movie doesnt seem to have them. Madagascar needs to be a funnier movie.</p></body></html>

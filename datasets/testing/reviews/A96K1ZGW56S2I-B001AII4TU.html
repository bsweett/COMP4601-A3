<meta name="summary" content="The Third Time Isn't Charming Enough."></head><body><p>When King Harold (John Cleese) falls ill and eventually croaks, Shrek (Mike Myers) takes over the duties of King of Far, Far Away.  He quickly realizes that he's just doesn't have what it takes to be a king. After all, he is an ogre.  When he learns of another relative in line for the throne, Shrek sets out with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find the long lost heir, Arthur (Justin Timberlake).  While Shrek is gone, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) forms an army of evil doers and overtakes the city.  Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and her friends fight back, so that all is chaos by the time Shrek returns.<br /><br />I really enjoyed SHREK. I was even more impressed by SHREK 2 and in some ways think it is a superior movie to the original.  I was really looking forward to seeing SHREK THE THIRD and seeing how creative the filmmakers would get bringing together the fairy tale world of Shrek and the legends of King Arthur.<br /><br />I was severely disappointed to find that they chose not to be creative.  The plot of the movie is interesting enough, but the execution is horrible.  For instance, take the character of Merlin.  Instead of making him into a strong ally who could help Shrek and Artie, he's portrayed as a bumbling teacher of magic who was fired from Artie's school.  He can't remember his spells and seems to struggle with narcolepsy.  That idea of Merlin seems funny on paper, but it just doesn't work on screen.  Or take Prince Charming.  In SHREK 2 he was portrayed as the chosen heir to marry Fiona, raised by Fairy Godmother and groomed to be the perfect King.  In this installment he's downgraded to being a bad actor re-enacting Shrek's defeat of Fairy Godmother.  Charming should be a great fighter and warrior, but instead he's portrayed as being a wimp who decides he will get his revenge by having a huge play where he literally kills Shrek on stage.  Then there's the last five minutes of the movie.  I won't say what it involves, but the musical montage completely ruins the tone of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie doesn't have some good moments.  I really enjoyed the medieval take on high school.  I also really enjoyed the princesses' revolt.  Still, there just wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the bad.<br /><br />Children will like SHREK THE THIRD and it is worth watching if you've seen the first two SHREK films.  However, if you're looking for the same style, humor, and tone that made the first two SHREK movies such a joy to watch, you won't find it here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All that was funny was sprayed away! Travolta becomes a cosmetic debacle!"></head><body><p>This is going to be the second tough review for me this season.HAIRSPRAY fell flat! All that was teased was let down.<br /><br />As a Baltimore boy myself who grew up and remember the significant events that shaped John Waters' original 1988 spoof on our town,I also saw HAIRSPRAY:THE MUSICAL twice on Broadway in 2002-3.Though altered somewhat from the source material, there was still a magical and infectious feeling that one got watching the big basso-profundo Harvey Fierstein ,in his Tony Award winning performance, lumber across the New York Stage as the Amazonian laundress Edna Turnblad.Fierstein,probably New York's most beloved actor, as a huge gay man, was the first musical incarnation since the irreplaceable late Divine(Baltimore's native "son")originated the role in Waters' break-out flick.The 300 pound  Divine,as well as the scratchy-voiced Fierstein,WERE "hefty-hideaway-chicks".  These naturally behemoth  men WERE the ever-dieting ironing (arning) maven desperately trying to cope with the ever-changing "rock'n'rollers" that were changing the course of social history in this town!.In fact,Glenn Milstead (Divine) was ALWAYS John Waters' leading lady!He, like Fierstein, knew how to BE a woman!( See Harvey Fierstein in TORCH SONG TRILOGY.See Divine in FEMALE TROUBLES,PINK FLAMINGOS,POLYESTER and LUST IN THE DUST.)<br /><br /> Here then is my biggest rub,Hon!: John Travolta was not Edna! Clad in mountains of rubbery flesh and tons of cakey make-up, Travolta's facial features were as stiff as a newly over-Botoxed victim that turned his dialogue into complete and incomprehensible mush. The "fat suit" drew way too much attention to itself in a badly performed cosmetic stunt.Travolta's Edna Turnblad is never a "real" woman.She instead is turned into a prosthetic caricature  that in no way captures the original movie or stage "Edna" who was a real-feeling and breathing "woman".Divine's and Fierstein's natural "largess" flowed effortlessly, fat rolls and all! John Travolta, on the flipside, is always a man encased  in mounds of artificial flesh...and not at all funny.His rubber suit floats and bounces with the wind and Christopher Walken , who was thoroughly convincing as husband Wilbur in a much-expanded part, needed to steer clear as Travolta may have floated into the air at a seconds notice! Travolta would have never been my choice.The hugs and the unashamed kisses that Fierstein and Dick Latessa freely shared on stage as the loving and hotly attracted Edna and Wilbur  wowed 'em in New York as those two men sexily and playfully romped through the softshoe "You're Timeless to Me".Here two men lightly Fred Astairishly tip-toe mostly holding hands beneath Edna's airing laundry, free of all overt sexiness (remember Wilbur was HOT for chubby chicks!) that made audiences applaud wildly as the couple kissed and embraced, free from all hang-ups.Broadway breathlessly waited for that magical moment! Here, Travolta reclines in a chaise,fat suit practically eating him up, and Wilbur dampens the candle.Would it have been too much to see Walken and Travolta kiss? At least THAT would have been true to the characters!In fact, even the "French kissing" of Tracy and Link is totally removed.Anything that was sexy and crass....GONE WITH THE FAT SUIT!!!<br /><br />Hollywood needed  a big named star to attract all audiences to a musical that many folks never would have seen otherwise  on a live stage.If you have seen the original movie and the stage musical,the 2007 version strays unfortunately even further(ESPECIALLY the ending that betrays both previous versions thus severely altering the whole intent!!!) If this HAIRSPRAY is your first intro to Baltimore, than chances are you will be far more entertained than I was.The dancing is contagious...the humor,sexiness and infectious obsurdity that was John Waters and even Broadway is faded like a bad dye job. What once made HAIRSPRAY outrageously funny and edgey is as tamed and relaxed as Pia Zadora's ironed hair in Waters' cult classic about his home town.<br /><br />The expanding of Velma Van Tassle's screen time to the point of adding a totally unnecessary seduction scene because Michelle Pfeiffer's contract may have called for it was ludicrous. The scene was long and drawn out, and again, not funny.Her enunciation in "Miss Baltimore Crabs" was deplorable! Again...big star...not funny!There is a MAJOR difference the way "stage" actors inhabit these characters verses the manner in which "film stars" do the same.A tremendously slimmed-down Pfeiffer looked good, but that was it: not a singer...not a dancer!<br /><br />Queen Latifah?...spot-on casting! Her deeply soulful singing of "I know where I've Been" as the kids marched on WYZT still is the number that brings the house down every time on Broadway! On the other hand,"Big Blonde and Beautiful" was severly edited, losing all that is so positive and right about this song of affirmation for the "plus-sized" woman...black or white! There are two new numbers written for the film version.<br /><br />That said...where this film hits all of the right notes is in the outstanding choreography of Adam Shankman who really did his homework in recreating the  dances that prevailed in the black and white youth of the time. Every step was a piece of "the mashed potato", "the watusi","the pony","the hully-gully" "the bird" and "the funky chicken"! Any youth who danced on Baltimore's Saturday- must-see The Buddy Deane Show, the "real" Corny Collins Show, will be overwhelmed and overjoyed at how energetic and totally accurate Shankman's dances are.They are slick, full of exaggeration and high energy. The white dances are more naturally subdued and contained for "the nicest kids in town"-"nice WHITE kids". The black numbers are sexy, sensual and so full of unrestricted body movement that THIS is the reason we white kids longed to be with our black friends as much as they wanted to be with us.We loved their "MOTOWN" music and they wanted equal dance time with us. Music and dance WAS our common bond in a city  dominated by segregation. This is WHY we picketed WJZ-TV Channel 13 in Baltimore. For Shankman's masterful dance routines, this HAIRSPRAY stands-out even over the Broadway musical.It is the newcomers, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly and James Marsden that bring pizazz to this film.They perform as the fresh,young,naive and totally optimistic "hair-hoppers" that we were.Amanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton?...eh!!!Allison Janney as her mother fared better.Why was Mrs. Pingleton reading with "cross" bookmarks and performs an exorcism? Baltimore was then a predominantly Roman Catholic town.Things were strict.Lines were not crossed.<br /><br />What continues to be diluted,though, as HAIRSPRAY dances to success, is the original ridiculous,crass humor and justified stereotype of our "hick town" that made (and still makes) "Bawlmer" so completely bizarre so much so that John Waters' penned his HAIRSPRAY in the first place. When Baltimore saw the original movie premiere at our historic Senator Theatre in 1988, the WHOLE town laughed at itself and it was THE single highlight that black and white locals shared together.We are a hung-up,carss and very diverse lot,here! Yesterday,we all sat in the theatre at the premiere ....and not a single laugh, except for John Waters' cameo as "the flasher" in the opening number "Good Morning Baltimore,was heard for the 107 minutes of pulse-pounding entertainment. We silently got up from our cushy seats,people did not stay for the credits ( a hallmark of moviegoers in Baltimore),more than a little deflated puzzling in ourselves, "Where was our Baltimore?" ....It had disappeared in a nostalgic time warp that was somehow lost in translation even further as our "Ultra-Clutch-High-Haired-Wannabe-Po'Dunk" city slipped beneath rubber suits, Hollywood A-List actors and razzle-dazzle choreography and editing.What had made HAIRSPRAY so original was gone along with the 1960's.None of us spoke. We all filed out too afraid to speak what was really on our minds: all that was funny was sprayed away!</p></body></html>

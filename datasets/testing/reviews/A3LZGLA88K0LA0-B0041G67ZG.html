<meta name="summary" content="WASTE OF TALENT"></head><body><p>A pedigree of Oscar winning actors and a director are sadly wasted in THE INTERPRETER.  I consider myself of above average intelligence and attention span, but the convoluted script for this movie takes so many turns and the pace is so slow that it is hard to become truly involved in the outcome.  Nicole Kidman gives a glowing performance as always as a UN interpreter who overhears the assassination plot for a visiting African dignitary.  Sean Penn is the SS agent haunted by the recent death of his estranged wife, and the agent who handles Kidman's accusations.  Catherine Keenar is wasted as Penn's partner, a cardboard character whose presence is nominal to say the least.  Director Sydney Pollack turns up in a cameo as Penn's hardnosed boss, but his direction is certainly not Oscar caliber.  I'm not sure what the scriptwriter's intentions were for this movie, but as a thriller it misses the mark and as a character study, it barely sustains interest, in spite of the noteworthy performances.  A shame to see such talent squandered.</p></body></html>

One day I saw that The Bridge on the River Kwai was playing. I walked out of the theater knowing I had seen one of the best movies ever made.<br />  The plot is about a bridge being built by Allied prisoners of war. The battle centers around two strong willed men. Col Nicholson (Alec Guinness) a british commander who refuses to comply with Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa)who runs the camp. During this battle Cmdr./Maj. Shears (William Holden) escapes only to be called back into duty to destroy the bridge that now Nicholson has taken great pride in constructing.<br />  This is one of those movies that is slow paced but done so deliberetly. Director David Lean paces the movie so by the end you don't even want to go to the bathroom, (Lean would use the same style in the brilliant Lawrence of Arabia).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="RIGHT ON TARGET"></head><body><p>The delirously funny crew that brought us comic zombies in SHAUN OF THE DEAD take on action movies in this clever film featuring marvelous performances from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who investigate a series of bizarre accidents in quaint little Sandford. Pegg is certain they are really murders, and with Frost at his side, he finds out he's not wrong at all.<br />The dialogue and situations are original and witty, and the movie is surprisingly graphic in its violence, but hey these are guys who gave us lots of blood in SHAUN!  The supporting cast is wonderful featuring nice bits from Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward and Billie Whitelaw.  I actually enjoyed this movie more than SHAUN!</p></body></html>

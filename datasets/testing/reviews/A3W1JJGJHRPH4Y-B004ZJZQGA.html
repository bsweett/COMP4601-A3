The movie is about miserable people, living with the morally bad choices they've made, knowing that life should be better than what they are experiencing. What I like about the movie is that the two main characters take responsibility for the bad choices they've made. They don't have any solutions, but they are willing to take responsibility. Fiennes character is wonderfully strange. I'm not sure this is every one's cup of tea, but I was smiling through out.<br /><br />One of the key scenes is when Fiennes character confronts a character that Farrel's character roughed up. Fiennes points out that it is his own fault so he should stop whining. One of the main themes of the movie is how the characters define duty and responsibility in a morally ambiguous environment.</p></body></html>

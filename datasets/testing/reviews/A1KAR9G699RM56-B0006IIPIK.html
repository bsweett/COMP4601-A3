Picture this: scientists are disappearing, giant robots pop up randomly across the globe, and Jude Law's character with his Flying Tiger style airplane is the worlds hope.  Now that's a comic book plot.<br /><br />You know what?  I saw almost no advertising, except for one poster, thus I had actually a rather bad presumption of the film (although I try not to pre-judge.)  When it comes down to it though, the story was interesting enough to keep the viewer watching, but not nessecarily too deeply.<br /><br />The largest fault in my mind was the style.  I mean could anyone really see what was going on because of how dark everything appeared to be?  Maybe that's because Skycaptain was the first film done entirely with green screen, or maybe that is not it.  On top of that issue, the story is just chock full of holes.  Not questions to be answered just spots of boredom.  On top of that, another Jude Law film, which for those who don't or won't remember 2004 should no it as the year we Jude'd too many.<br /><br />  Summarily, those looking for Jolie will be suprised by her brevity on screen, and those looking for Jude will wonder why everything looks like a pit.  All in all, the movie was mere popcorn entertainment.</p></body></html>

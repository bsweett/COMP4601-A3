<meta name="summary" content="Why so many bad reviews???"></head><body><p>I am really tired of people putting this movie down. When I read the negative reviews it's obvious to me most of these people have never even seen the movie because they have no clue as to what they are talking about. First of all, this is the only movie that is completely faithful to the video game. No, Lara isn't running through tombs throughout the entire thing flipping switches but that would be boring. Lara does go in a tomb though and solves puzzles which is what the game is about. The game is also about this strong, independent woman out to save the world. Which is what this movie faithfully brings to the screen. So what if Lara isn't wearing a green shirt and brown shorts??? She's wearing all black in the new Tomb Raider game. Give me a break! And Angelina Jolie is the perfect Lara Croft. Even the game's real life models don't look as much like Lara as Angelina does. And her acting in this movie is wonderful. She brings to the film a sense of power and control that not even the game has. When you see Angelina playing Lara you know she is always in complete control of the situation. The storyline is great. It takes Lara all over the world in great locations and the whole thing is about solving one big puzzle which is what the game is about. What more do you want people??? Tomb Raider is the perfect video game movie!</p></body></html>

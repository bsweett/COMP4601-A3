<meta name="summary" content="Great adventurous movie!"></head><body><p>I adored this movie. I have heard from people that they found it confusing, but I disagree. I got everything perfectly the first time around and loved it from beginning to end. The acting was great, Johnny of course was awesome as usual and the effects were amazing. I loved the length of the movie too. Most people would think it long but it had me completely enthralled that I forgot about the length. Its just a great fun popcorn flick. Actually, its the epitome of popcorn flicks.</p></body></html>

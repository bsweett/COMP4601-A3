The Robert de Niro character survives<br />but everyone else dies in this modern tragedy<br />that reminds one of a Shakespeare play.<br />My take on this is that the next generation<br />crime bosses are the ones behind the laundered money<br />corporations that run Los Vegas now.<br />The fantastic profits are still there and<br />still being sent in suitcases to the people running things,<br />but just in a way that is apparently completely legal.<br />Cheaters in the Casinos still gets treated pretty much the same?<br />There are still holes dug in the desert...</p></body></html>

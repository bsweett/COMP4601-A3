<meta name="summary" content="Actually cute..."></head><body><p>We all have to say that Tim Burton is one of those actors who is really out there...but I have to say, that this film, Corpse Bride, was really cute.  The story was funny, heartful, and just a great story all around....this is a movie that you can actually watch with the kids...there are what I would call some scary images, that I am sure some kids may have  problem with, but it is just in one part, and it is over quick...the music is great as well...yes, I would consider buying the CD....check this one out!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="JENNIFER CONNELLY is AMAZING!!!!"></head><body><p>She was so brillant in this film. Its so good, its very mature and artys thats why people don't like it. And yes its like THE RING because DARK WATER inspired the it! So can people say that THE RING is like DARK WATER not the other way around. (DARK WATER and THE RING were both Japanese remakes if you did not know. But Connelly's work her rivals her work in A BEAUTIFUL MIND and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Go see this if you are a mature adult that likes intelligent psychological dramas, don't see this if you are a stupid teen looking for a teen horror date film. Its much more than that and it is a great film!</p></body></html>

The first problem I have is they always seem to use these "dumb white guys" for the protagonists in the films.  it's like, how can you really pull for them and feel sorry for their situation, when their character is borderline unlikable from the get-go?  I also find the storyline abit confusing at times, there is so much going on, you seem to have to be completely wrapped up in all of the films storylines to understand fully what's going on.  As far as gore, this had got to be the most digusting horror film I have EVER seen.  I almost never have to look away from the screen but on this one, I simply cannot watch the brain surgery scene or the twist torture sequence at the end.  I can only look for a second and then immeadiatley look away again.  I guess this could be a good thing, that's why were horror fans right?  This was Shawnee Smith's movie, I love her in some other films, she's always plays quirky roles.  I wish she would have acted more edgy and bizarre like in some of her other roles.  Check her out in "Leaving Las Vegas" and "The Stand".  She rocks.  I still haven't seen Saw 4, can't wait even though it seems like I'm sort of dissing the whole franchise, I still want to see saw, huh?</p></body></html>

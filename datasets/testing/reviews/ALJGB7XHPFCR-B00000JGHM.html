<meta name="summary" content="Los Angleles Crime Wave"></head><body><p>Heat is an absolutely top notch crime thriller, with fabulous action scenes, excellent character development, great subplots, and strong performances all around. It is much, much more than a vehicle for De Niro and Pacino, and that's saying quite a lot, because it happens to be a good one at that. With all the testosterone flying about, the wonderful performances by Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd and Amy Brenneman really shine. The first time I saw it I fell victim to expectations of a De Niro/Pacino scene of epic significance.  Avoid my mistake, and enjoy the film.</p></body></html>

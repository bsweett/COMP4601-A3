<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant Film About Living And Facing The Hours...Of Life"></head><body><p>Michael Cunningham's award winning novel, &quot;The Hours,&quot; received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and was chosen as Best Book of 1998 by The New York Times. Because the book is so extraordinary, I was apprehensive about how the film, based on this complex novel, could possibly succeed. David Hare performed a miracle in writing this true and beautiful adaptation, in a manner faithful to the book, and also suited for the big screen. He captured everything, including the important literary allusions, with great sensitivity and fidelity. Stephen Daldry's direction encouraged the superb talents of his ensemble cast. Daldry has once again proven to be a master of his craft.<p>The film is a richly told, often tragic story, of the interwoven lives of three women, from three different periods in time. The common thread is Virginia Woolfe's novel Mrs. Dalloway.<p>Virginia Woolfe, brilliantly portrayed by Nicole Kidman, is living in isolation with her husband Leonard in 1923. Ms. Woolfe has a long history of mental illness, and has attempted suicide twice. Her doctors and her husband agree that she will possibly find peace away from London. The literary couple is living in Richmond, where Leonard has set up a printing press, thinking to involve his wife in publishing. She has begun to write &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; the story of a day in the life of one woman, Clarissa Dalloway, &quot;a woman's whole life in a single day - and in that day her whole life.&quot; Virginia is plainly fixated on death. She understands the nature of her illness, and at one point explains to Leonard that although he must live with the burden of her illness, so must she. She decides that someone in her new novel must die. When Richard asks who will die, and why, Virginia responds,&quot;...the poet, the visionary will die, so that the others will value life more.&quot;<p>Laura Brown, (Julianne Moore), is a young housewife, pregnant with her second child, in post-World War II, Los Angles. She is desperately unhappy in her marriage. Her husband, a war veteran, clearly worships her. Their young son, with a child's intense perception, senses the tension and unhappiness in his mother, that his father seems oblivious to. Laura begins reading Virginia Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, and is deeply affected by the novel. She begins to have doubts about her life choices, and despairs that suicide may be her only way out.<p>Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), lives in contemporary Manhattan, and is an editor and writer. She could be a mirror image of a modern Mrs. Dalloway. Her closest friend, and former lover, Richard, a novelist and poet, actually calls Clarissa, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; Like Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa is giving a party, for Richard, who is about to receive a prestigious lifetime achievement award for his poetry. She sets off one beautiful morning, like Mrs. Dalloway, to buy flowers for her party. Then she visits Richard, whom she has taken care of for years. He is slowly dying of AIDS.<p>The intermingling of the three women's lives, and their struggle to find meaning, outside of brief moments of happiness, is very powerful. The visual montage of the three women, is superb and so effective. It is almost a collage at times. The musical score is haunting, and adds much to the film's mood. And the acting is superior, not just by the three women, but by the entire supporting cast.<p>The tension builds toward a powerful ending, which even though I read the book, still came as a surprise. This is a deeply moving film, about living out the hours of ones life, about love, survival, and about mental illness and creativity. I highly recommended it!</p></body></html>

Then maybe like Alias with some hot butt kicking.  Nope!  She was just focused on spider boy... I guess spider boy was suppose to be her assignment???  I just kept waiting for it to get better.  Just when I thought it was going to get good, they movie goes into a different direction.  It was a flop.  Great actors with bad scenes and difficult to follow.  This movie was constantly getting off track.  And that ending... what was that?  What a waist.  Don't do a sequel Angelina.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Disney Animated Film"></head><body><p>Music, sound, color, and motion were what Walt Disney once said about exploring the world of animation. This movie has it all! The pure use of the classical backdrop of Sleeping Beauty Ballet embraces this animated feature with a children's book come to life in a 3D manner, when 3D was looked upon as a cinema gimmick. Don't get me wrong, it's not a 3D movie, but seeing this film on the big screen theatre, makes one feel they have entered those magic castles-firsthand.<br /><br />The gimmick here is to give the three good fairies each a unique color, which they relish, even for their change into peasant women, harboring the young princess in the middle of the forest in order to shield her from the witches curse.<br /><br />The witch, of course, is dark, sinister, and very gothic. Not wanting to give into failure for her announced wicked spell cast upon the young princess since birth.<br /><br />During an outdoor walk, the young princess stumbles upon a male stranger, who happens to be her once betrothed, and whom she is bound to marry. Not knowing he is the prince, and him not knowing she is the princess, they both fall in love with each other amongst cute trailing animals.<br /><br />The miscommunication goes further down the road as they announce their love for each other with the people who have been protecting them, and then think they have fallen for some stranger.<br /><br />It's the witch who becomes the first to find out they have mistakingly bonded, and captures the prince as hostage. (For he alone can break the spell, with love's first kiss).<br /><br />It's not enough that she finally set the spell upon the princess, when she finds out her hostage has been set free. Ultimately transforming herself into a raging demon, in order to thwart his advance towards the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Fine animated tale, and incredible execution style for a film developed in the late 50's.<br /><br />Thank God the home video big screens are getting bigger!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The animation is great but the story is lackluster in everyway"></head><body><p>This movie is not a really bad film but it's not a good film. The film is overall not a great film so i will say it's ok at times but most of all it's bad. The good parts of the movie are the animation it's great and the movie is very visual to watch and while you watch it you love the animation. The bad parts are the story it's very short only 77 min, there is no point to the story and it's very lacluster, the voices are also very dull and have no life to them. The movie is a waste of time so dont bother watching it you wont be enertained.</p></body></html>

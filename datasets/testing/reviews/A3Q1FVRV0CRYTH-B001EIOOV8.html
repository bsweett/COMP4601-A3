<meta name="summary" content="A classic if I ever saw one!"></head><body><p>I've been biting at the heels to write a review of this brilliant film but, as I was when debating my Godfather review, I was hesitant for I know I could never do the movie justice.  First off, major props go to Scorsese for his brilliant direction.  It still ticks me off he hasn't won an Oscar yet.  Anyways, the film also sports brilliant acting on the parts of De Niro, Pesci and Stone, Stone standing out and nabbing the Oscar nom (and should have been win!)<br /><br />The film (based off true-crime novel 'Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas' by Nicholas Pileggi) follows friends Sam and Nicky as they work the Las Vegas gambling scene.  De Niro plays Sam 'Ace' Rothstien (based on real life gangster Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal) a man assigned by the mafia to run a casino in Las Vegas.  The first hour of the film plays like a documentary, run over with voice over explaining the mafia's involvement with gambling in the casinos.  Sam meets and falls for the sassy Ginger (Stone) who marries him mostly for money.  Sam, kind hearted as he is, actually trusts her, and this proves to be his end in many ways.  Pesci plays Nicky Santoro, Sam's backstabbing pistol of a friend, short, round and confident.  Pesci always plays the short tempered "I can't believe a guy his size would pick that battle" type character...and he always pulls it off.<br /><br />Over the course of the three-hour epic you watch as not only Sam's marriage and status but also the mafia's control of the gambling scene is jeopardized by events involving Sam, Nicky and Ginger.  This is a brilliant film that to me rises above 'Goodfellas' for it's as serious as it is intriguing and it never once begins to bore.</p></body></html>

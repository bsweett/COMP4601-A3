<meta name="summary" content="So Ridiculous That I LOVED IT!!---And That's Not A Diss!!"></head><body><p>The funny thing about how this movie got me is that my pre-teen nephews<br />were dying to go see it and begged me to take them when I had them<br />over one weekend! If it weren't for that, I would've surely skipped<br />over this one, but boy I'm glad I didn't now!  (-:<br />Of course, the whole premise, if you are a person who just breaks<br />everything down in logical and concrete terms and lack a sense of humor<br />will seem ridiculous to you. But this is one of these films where you<br />abandon all that and just take the journey with the story to a heightened reality.<br />Then you'll get completely swept up in it and you'll see what I mean when I say<br />that it's so ridiculous that you'll love it! (-:<br />It's funny, it's dark, their are poignant moments too...a very unique film.<br />I loved all the performances in this film...Nick Cage (Big Daddy),<br />Mark Strong, everybody!  Of course the girl superhero (Hit-Girl) does steal<br />many of the scenes in the film, but I liked KICKASS himself, Aaron Johnson, as well.<br />The awkward, otherwise nerdy outcast kid, who shows an inner strength<br />and inner beauty that inspires others in his community who would otherwise<br />mock him to find their own inner superheroes to effect change is the underlying<br />message of this film without being preachy about it.<br />The production, direction and story were all well done, but what would<br />you expect when you have Brad Pitt's PLAN B productions at the helm!<br />When I saw him showing up to promos and opening nights for this movie<br />on Entertainment Tonight, that should've been a tip off for me!<br />There's no way that a star of his stature would affiliate himself<br />with a project like this unless he thought it was good.<br />Like I said, give it a chance and it will get you!<br />KICKASS does just that!----Kicks ass!

I grew up in the South and have never heard of stories such as conjoined twins from North Korea, or a witch who'll show you your own death through a glass eye. My wife kept elbowing me in the ribs throughout this film. She couldn't believe someone could spin as much bull as I do. Well there's your proof. I don't see how this movie can be called 'moving'. I mean the son might have learned a lesson in that maybe his father was more than a teller of tall tales, but then again who wants to hear the story of one's own birth a million times whether it's true or not?</p></body></html>

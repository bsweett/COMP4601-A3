<meta name="summary" content="The Best of Them All."></head><body><p>this is quite simply the best Die Hard movie there is, nay, the best action film of the summer (I didn't' see the third Borne movie so I can't compare it to that). sure the action is over the top, sure the story may be a bit of a stretch (I hope) and sure the whole daughter thing may have been a bit cheesy, but it's all worth it to see McLane shoot himself though the shoulder to hit the bad guy behind him. Classic.<br /><br />What's not to love about this movie? Unless of course you want realism in which case you may be out of luck. McLane blows up a Copter with his car, some Asian chick keeps fighting after being rammed against a wall with an SUV, our hero takes a ride on the outside of a flying fighter jet, but hey, it's all in good fun. As long as you don't think about it too hard, this movie will definitely make you sit on the edge of your seat. Enjoy. if you read this review, please leave a comment.<br /><br />Replay value; Very high.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"></head><body><p>A lot has changed in the wizarding world during the summer between Harry's fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts. Voldemort is back, but not in the open, and the ministry is ignoring it. The Minister of Magic feels threatened by Dumbledore and Potter and has been exerting control over the wizarding press to make it seem like they are both insane liars. This somber turn of events allows Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to discuss deeper topics than in previous Harry Potter installments; topics like government corruption and control, freedom of the press, corporal punishment, etc. The film also examines public responsibility in the midst of totalitarian government through the lens of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron's underground Defense of the Dark Arts class known as Dumbledore's Army. Hefty material for a series most people look at as children's fantasy fiction, huh?<br /><br />Teens approaching Harry Potter's age already deal with issues of rebellion and angst, but in times as hard as those facing Harry in Phoenix, those feelings are heightened. When I first read the book I thought that Harry was being a bit of a brat throughout this installment, but now I realize is the magnitude of what he was dealing with. He saw the most dangerous wizard of all time rise from a place between death and life and watched him murder a fellow classmate, yet no one believes him when he recounts this information.  Dumbledore, Harry's mentor and father figure, seems to completely ignore him, and the government interferes with the dealings of Hogwarts, the one place Harry holds sacred. Radcliffe does a great job at giving life to Harry's turmoil during this installment, and it seems that the entire youthful cast is continuously growing as actors. I'm sure working with several directors and brilliant veteran actors helped them through the process.<br /><br />Once again, a new director takes over the reigns of the series in Phoenix. The choice of David Yates as the fourth and final director of the series was kind of a surprise. Prior to Order of the Phoenix Yates had only directed television movies, so many people were unsure about this somewhat untested talent. There was no need to worry in my opinion. Not only did Yates make one of the best movies of the series, he also turned the longest Harry Potter book into the shortest movie without making it feel rushed or leaving any plot holes.<br /><br />Mostly featuring returning cast members that were basically absent for an installment (Gary Oldman has a much bigger part, and David Thewlis is back after being absent from Goblet of Fire), Order of the Phoenix doesn't contain very many new characters, but the few that are there represent quite a coup d'etat in casting. Finding newcomer Evanna Lynch for the role of Luna Lovegood was a brilliant feat in and of itself, and the role of Professor Umbridge is brilliantly played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake, Freedom Writers), who brings Umbridge's toad-like qualities to life. Also joining the cast is the always marvelous Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club, Hamlet) as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange.<br /><br />I find this film to be better than Goblet of Fire, but it's still not without its failings. Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore still doesn't match up to J.K. Rowling's description of the character. While better than he was in the previous film, Gambon's Dumbledore still  doesn't create an impression of being the greatest wizard alive. I was also disappointed that certain details concerning the prophecy didn't make it into the film. In the book, you learn that the prophecy didn't explicitly mean that Harry would be Voldemort's enemy, but that it could have applied to another student at Hogwarts. It's not central to the plot, but I felt this was an interesting fact that viewers of the movie who haven't read the books missed out on.<br /><br />Critically, Order of the Phoenix is at the low end of the Potter films, tied for last place with Philosopher's Stone. At the box office, it continued the rise in box office receipts started with Goblet of Fire, surpassing it to become the second- highest grossing film of the series and of the year, with $938.2 million grossed worldwide. As this occurred with a summer release, those who thought that Prisoner of Azkaban grossed lower due to the release date were proven wrong. Of course, with its shorter run time and what is arguably the most brilliant scene of the series, Order of the Phoenix turned into quite the overall success.</p></body></html>

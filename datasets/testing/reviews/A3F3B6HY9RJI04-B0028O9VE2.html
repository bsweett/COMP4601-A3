<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic acting, gripping story, but off at parts"></head><body><p>Here is the story of Cristina Moreno and her relationship with her mother, Flor.  The story (basically) begins when Cristina's father/Flor's husband takes off when she is a young child in Mexico.  Because of their poverty level, Flor and Cristina are forced to flee Mexico in hopes of finding a better life in Southern California.  In time, Flor takes up a job as a nanny or a housekeeper (the job wasn't very specific) for the Clasky family and is thrust upon the inner termoil that is present.<br /><br />The story is fun to follow and a real emotional roller-coaster.  However, I was blown away by the acting of six of the characters.  There has got to be some Oscar nominations in this movie somewhere for at least three of them.<br /><br />Flor is played by Paz Vega.  At the beginning of the movie she doesn't speak a word of English, even as she begins her job with the Clasky's.  Flor is very attractive and she has one of the best looks of shock, confusion, anger, and frustration at the events that unfold before her.  It is easy to fall in love with the character of Flor who lives for nobody except her daughter and understands the sacrifices it requires to raise a child.  If everybody raised children with the conviction that Flor had then there wouldn't be a messed up kid anywhere.<br /><br />John Clasky is played by Adam Sandler.  I am often a Sandler fan, except when he is shooting for laughs by being a complete drunken idiot.  If that is what you like and are expecting in this movie, don't go, you'll be sadly disappointed.  I'm glad he is shying away from that type of role these days, and he most definately doesn't play that role here.  John Clasky is the perfect father and if I had any complaint it was that he was too perfect.  Yes, some foibles were present, but I would have liked to have seen an uglier side of John Clasky to make this movie a bit more real.  However, Sandler still delivers a stand-up job that should be loudly applauded.<br /><br />Next is Shelbie Bruce, who plays Flor's daughter, Cristina.  As a child actor (I'm guessing 10 years old) she does an incredible job.  Cristina is a child who thinks she knows what is best for herself and is open to the manipulations of Deborah Clasky.  She is often at odds with her mother on doing what is right and is torn apart by the decisions that her mother makes.  There was a scene where Flor, who hasn't learned to speak English, confronts John Clasky and uses Cristina as a translater.  Shelbie Bruce does a wonderful job not only translating the words of her mother, but also her feeling.  It was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  Shelbie Bruce even does a great job at the end of the movie when she finally confronts Flor because of the decisions Flor has made for her.<br /><br />And on to my three favorite characters.<br /><br />The first is Tea Leoni who plays Deborah Clasky.  I've always liked Tea Leoni as she usually shines in every movie she is in.  However, this is the first movie where she really lets herself go, in my opinion (granted, I haven't seen most of her movies).  There are scenes where she plays her stunningly beautiful self but then there are scenes where she goes the complete opposite direction.  She gets so bad in one scene that her mother (played by Cloris Leachman, she is next) comments that she needs a fire hose to clean herself up.  It is nice to see somebody like her allow herself to get so undone in a movie.  She can play emotion very well and she doesn't fail here as she plays every emotion I've ever felt in my life.<br /><br />The second is Cloris Leachman, who plays Deborah Clasky's mother.  Every scene with her in it just shines, and most of them just made me laugh out loud.  She most definately has the best and funniest lines of the movie.  However, Cloris' performance is dead on in every scene of the movie as, she too, must go through most of the emotional spectrum.<br /><br />And finally, the older Clasky child is Bernice, who is played by Sarah Steele.  Bernice is looking for some affection from her parents, especially  her mother.  You see some of the few moments of excitement in her eyes when she thinks she is being treated by her mother, and you totally identify with her during her disappointments.  Again, she also has a dead-on performance with every scene she is in and forces you to emphasize with the problems her character has.<br /><br />The story has a great message, which is that there is no greater sacrifice than those for your children and often through your children.  Some of the lines and the logic seemed a bit off, but the ending leaves you satisfied that you got your money's worth in a movie.  I especially love the highlighted differences between the American and Latino cultures.  I would recommend this movie for those who really enjoy a great performance on the screen.</p></body></html>

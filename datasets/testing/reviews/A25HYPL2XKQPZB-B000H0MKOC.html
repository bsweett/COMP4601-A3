<meta name="summary" content="A funny satire on the smoking lobby"></head><body><p>Jason Reitman directs the satire THANK YOU FOR SMOKING. This movie isn't worthy of blockbuster status, but is definitely one you should check out. The cast is great, the style is addicting, and the message of the movie, is, well I'm not sure.<br /><br />Smoking is an incredibly political issue now. Politicians have to have the cigarrette industry to make money. They can talk all they want about how bad they are, but if Big Tobacco goes out of business, then the politcians lose billions of dollars. I think the movie hits its mark pointing out the hipocracy of the critics of industries that take the place of personal responsibility. This movie is based on a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of William F. Buckley, one of the most conservative men in US history.<br /><br />The movie stars Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor, the incredibly suave lobbyist for Big Tobacco. His job is to fight the spin that tobacco is bad for you, and he does a great job. Some of the finest scenes are his lunch meeting with fellow lobbyists from Alcohol and Firearms. The movie gets its heart because if Nick's son. Nick struggles with the life he leads and tries to reconcile it with the impression he is leaving his son.<br /><br />If you enjoy smart, intelligent movies, then I urge your to check this one out.</p></body></html>

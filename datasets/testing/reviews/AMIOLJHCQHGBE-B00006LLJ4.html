<meta name="summary" content="A Great Thriller"></head><body><p>For once, the Amazon critics have it right. Tnis movie ranks with Bladerunner, Vanilla Sky, and the underrated A-I. ESPECIALLY Bladerunner (add in Dark City). It has the same impersonal dismal vision of the future.<p>I was never a Tom Cruise fan. He was always the romantic pretty boy. But his last two movies, Vanilla Sky and now Minority Report, have made me a fan. And I have always liked a good Spielberg film. This film is not just a great expo for Spielberg special effects, it is a great thriller a la Hitchcock. <p>Set in 2054, murders are elinated due to `precogs' seeing the future. Max Von Sydow is the head of the Precog corporation (in typical Von Sydow style). Cruise is the Chief of the crew that prevents these murders before they happen, and the movie takes off when he becomes the target of one of these `visions'. He has to overcome incredible odds to prove he wasn't going to commit the murder the precog's predicted.  But, TRUST ME, there is SO much more to the action than this short synopsis. I left it this way on purpose. If I tell all, it will ruin the effect of the movie.<p>About the cinematography...this is a dark film, and the whole movie is shot in near black and white. All the hues are toned down, and this sets the mood for the futuristic attitude (much like M. Night Shaymalan's Unbreakable) showing that there is no individuality. The fururistic vision of personalized advertising via retinal scanning is absolutely scary. I guarantee I will close my eyes in the future...<p>The sound is GREAT (for those of us with DTS). You hear rain drops to the side, and bubbles from the precog tank to the left. Absolutely SUPERB.<p>This is one of the best sci-fi thrillers I have seen this year. Again, this is not just a sci-fi movie. This is an excellent murder mystery not to be ignored.<p>If you have read my reviews in the past, you know I don't review poor films. Trust me, you will want to see this movie. I mean it.</p></body></html>

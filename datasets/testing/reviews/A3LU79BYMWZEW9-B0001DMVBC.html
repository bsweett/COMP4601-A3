In my own case, I found that the book packed such an emotional wallop that I was wary of any cinematic effort to tell this seemingly straightforward (but ultimately quite tricky) story.  When I finally did see it, it was on a smallish black and white TV at a friend's house.  I didn't care much for the film version then.  Like so many adaptations, it seemed too rushed, too skimpy on the characters "back stories" and their complex inner lives.  The acting was good, but too much of the dialogue seemed expository to me and not as "authentic" as the dialogue in the novel.<br /><br />Seeing it in color and on a much larger screen, as I did recently, did give me a somewhat different perspective.  The sheer beauty of the film was lost on me on the little black and white TV.  As someone below noted, it's hard to go wrong with the Pacific Coast as your background.  True, but the cinematography is more than just pretty to look at.  Here the stunning nature shots serve as a reminder that the human activity--no matter how high the stakes are for those involved--is ultimately petty, perhaps even meaningless, in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that many viewers (particularly those who have not read the book) find the plot overly schematic on the one hand, and the characters' actions almost inexplicable on the other.  The "back stories" really are essential to understanding the characters' motivations.  And without resorting to too many flashbacks or hokey "let me tell you my story" dialogue, there's only so much of that you can really insert into a movie.<br /><br />What flashbacks there are are limited to a few brief shots of Colonel Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley) and family's life in the Iran of the time of the Shah.  Presumably, the filmmakers felt that an American audience would need a little more information in their case than they might with the American born characters.  It doesn't hurt either that writer director Vadim Perelman also threw in a wedding scene (only alluded to in the book) that also gives the audience a flavor of Iranian culture and values.<br /><br />The general's nemesis in this real estate tug of war is an emotionally fragile, recovering addict named Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connolly) whose personal story is perhaps all too common a one, one we've certainly seen before.  The details of her previous life are skimpier, but we kind of know where she's coming from.<br /><br />Less clear, in the context of the film, are the motivation of the renegade police officer who abandons his wife and children to become Kathy's knight in shining  (blue) armor.  I imagine for those unfamiliar with the novel, his sudden abandonment of his family and (although this was not his intent originally) his career makes little dramatic sense.  It is certainly problematic--and a little too rushed--in the context of the film.  But Ron Eldard succeeds in giving us some hint of the turbulence going on inside the man.  No mean feat since he has comparatively less to work with than either Kingsley or Connolly.<br /><br />The actors work hard (and succeed, I think) in making their characters actions plausible within the context of the story. Of course, a common criticism of both the film AND the book is that its characters are "unlikeable" and not especially sympathetic, although some are more inclined to empathize with the Colonel and his family, given their plight as refugees and their characteristic dignity and pride.  Others seeing him as part of the Shah's brutally repressive regime might find him more reprehensible than the two principle American born characters, whose "crimes" might be viewed as "small timey" by comparison and their victims mainly themselves.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, however, the point of great storytelling is not to just evoke sympathy for characters we naturally like anyway.  It's considerably MORE difficult to make the reader or viewer feel compassion for characters we might not be drawn to in real life...ones we might even avoid contact with.  The film version is not quite as successful as the book in evoking that reaction--and plainly, neither the book OR the film won everyone over.  But for those open to it, the story is a strangely compelling one.  It reminds us of just how easily lives can spiral out of control.  In that, this particular tragedy--with its elements of cross-cultural misunderstanding and class and gender conflict--says a good deal about us all.</p></body></html>

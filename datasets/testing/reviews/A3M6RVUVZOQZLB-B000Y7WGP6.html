But I am not allowed.<br /><br />The opening credits are displayed against black and white clips, while a voice-over narrative describes the growing relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia before and after oil was discovered, a relationship going back to early last century. When the compound for American families of American oil business in Saudi Arabia is bombed and over 100 killed, a hand-picked crew of four FBI agents goes to investigate.<br /><br />As often happens when reasonable people of unfriendly sides work together, friendships are forged, grudgingly then respectfully. That these bonds are set is a testament that men are men, not their trappings, not their national identity, not their religious beliefs, but their common respect for recognized brotherhood.<br /><br />And what is this kingdom? Saudi Arabia? Islam? Oil power?  Brotherhood? Perhaps. I fully expected an action movie and that's what is delivered, but that is not the point. The searching for clues for the mastermind of the bombing, the interviewing, the struggle for more reach are just vehicles for a common bond. Two men, one American, one Saudi, both government officials, begin working together, not against each other to find evidence.<br /><br />From this point on, whatever the viewer expects to happen doesn't. There is a frenzy of fighting in the zealots' own home turf, with apparently every apartment dweller privy to uzis (or their update) and those guns that launch little flying torpedoes. However, with the team of four Americans and two Saudis working together, the master bomb maker is discovered. But there are consequences.<br /><br />It is not the conquest that the director goes for. It is the story itself, the characters, their relationship. In fact, it is amazing and productive that an action movie filled with violence can trumpet the glories that lie in men's hearts. "The Kingdom" is all that.</p></body></html>

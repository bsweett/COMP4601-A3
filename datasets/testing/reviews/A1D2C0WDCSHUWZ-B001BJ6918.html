<meta name="summary" content="She's gonna &quot;Kill Bill&quot;"></head><body><p>The Bride is back, and badder than ever. The second half of Quentin Tarantino's sprawling revenge epic &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is perhaps even better than the first, with twists, turns and more complications. Less action, more sizzling dialogue, and stuff that Part 1 only hinted at. <p>In part one of &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; the pregnant Bride (Uma Thurman) witnessed the slaughter of her fiancee, the guests at her wedding, and was shot in the head and left in a coma. Now, the Bride has killed O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). She has yet to check off two remaining names: cold-blooded Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) and Bill himself (David Carradine).<p>The Bride also has to contend with Bill's not-as-sloppy-as-he-looks brother Budd (Michael Madsen), and continues working her way up the list until she gets to Bill himself, with the intent of getting revenge. But a monkey wrench is thrown into the Bride's revenge plans when she learns the truth: The baby she was pregnant with is alive.<p>Having established the sumptuously gory backdrop of Part 1, Tarantino concerns himself a little more with story in Part 2. There's more exposition on the DIVAS  (Gordon Liu appears as Pei Mei, with silky white hair and beard straight out of a shampoo commercial), and greater fleshing out of the characters like Bill. He's no longer a faceless monster, but someone you can almost like. The story itself has become more complex.<p>The psychedelic feel of this movie is undeniable. It's almost like a parallel world where people can saunter into planes with katanas. (Try that with airline security measures!) As in Part 1, there are some wonderful fight scenes. Just don't expect Uma to rush around beheading dozens of people with big geysers of blood -- instead there's the harrowing duel with Elle. <p>Tarantino's directorial experiments pay off, playing around with camera angles, graininess and color. His dialogue is sharp as the Bride's sword. Unfortunately, he seems a little too interested in Bill, whose scenes linger a little too long. However, Carradine and Thurman are both rock-solid in virtually every scene they are in. Hannah and Liu are fun to watch too.<p>This deliciously geeky mishmash is a western/kung-fu revenge saga set in a parallel universe (Tarantinoland?). &quot;Kill Bill Volume 2&quot; surpasses the first half of this sprawling story. Stylish and freakish and not to be missed.</p></body></html>

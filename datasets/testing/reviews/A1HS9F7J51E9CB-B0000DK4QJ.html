This is 2054, and for the past five years, pre-recognition has been test sampled in Washington D.C.  There are three young people who have proved their prophecies are 100% correct among the three of them.  These predictions are flashed upon screens (in a most scientific manner), a wooden ball drops down a chute with the perpetrator's name on it and another with the name of the victim.  The chief of detectives (Tom Cruise) analyzes these scenes (I thought he was conducting an orchestra!) until he has enough information and then using spectacular transportation machines, gets to the crime scene in time to preempt the crime.  The perpetrator is "haloed" and put in some state of suspended animation under guard.  There has not been a murder in D.C. for five years.  Congress is ready to submit a bill to a national referendum to use this method nationwide.<p>The movie opens with a confident, ever-so competent Cruise reporting for duty through the labyrinth of a futuristic paranoia-inducing building.  He quickly gets to work before we are quite aware of what he is doing.  We get a sample of the how and the wherefore of a "precog" arrest.  A wife and her lover are spared being brutally murdered by the enraged husband.  End of task.  The action is loud, quick and overwhelming.  The scenes are shot in the harshest light or in grays and blacks.<p>Then to the crux of the matter.  What if there is a mistake? A detective (Colin Farrell) by order of the Attorney General's office has orders to investigate the whole procedure.  He comes on like a bad guy to high-minded Cruise and mentor Max van Sydow.  But isn't he right?  How can a person be convicted of a crime he didn't commit?  Cruise himself is falsely accused, and the chase begins a la "Fugitive."  At one point, he kidnaps one of the "precogs," powerfully and touchingly played by Samantha Morton, to help him prove his innocence.  <p>"Minority Report" is a long movie (2 hours 20 minutes), but it didn't seem overly long to me.  I was thoroughly engaged trying to keep up with the non-stop action and changing scenes.  It definitely is a Spielberg movie; who else would have you chase your own eyeballs?  I liked the moral questions that were part of the warp and weave of the movie.  The special effects were not overdone and seemed realistic for a movie set 50 years in the future.  Overall, "Minority Report" is about the best I have seen this year.</p></body></html>

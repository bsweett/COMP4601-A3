<meta name="summary" content=""Elektra" should have been released straight to video"></head><body><p>I was looking forward to see "Elektra" on DVD since I missed it in theaters, so I rented it today and I am glad I resisted purchasing this one. Jennifer Garner looks good and all (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but even that can't save the lame story, dialogue, and special effects. This is truly one of the worst comic book adaptations ever and shares that spot with Halle Berry's "Catwoman". If you want to see an extremely great comic book film, go out and witness the masterpiece "Sin City" which I have already seen twice. That film is worth your time and money, so pass on Elektra. You have been warned!</p></body></html>

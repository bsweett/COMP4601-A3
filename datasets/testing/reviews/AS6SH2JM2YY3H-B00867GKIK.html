It hits a home run for me every time!<br /><br />Those first 5 minutes are so funny and touching.  As kids, Carl and Ellie share a passion for their explorer hero, Charles Muntz, and his voyages to the mysterious Paradise Falls in South America.  They marry, with a newlywed goal of actually going there, but life's challenges prevent it from happening.  They have their careers, he as a balloon vendor, and she as an animal trainer, at the local zoo.  Clearly, they love kids, they love people, and they love each other.<br /><br />And then Ellie dies, their fantasy unfulfilled.<br /><br />It's easy to call old, lonely Carl Frederickson a "curmudgeon,"  and I had this sense from the previews.  However, a curmudgeon is "an ill-tempered person full of resentment and stubborn notions."  Okay...maybe he WAS a curmudgeon for a short period!  But most of his life he was not, and he certainly is not a curmudgeon by the end of the story.<br /><br />Carl finds that he is going to be shipped off to Shady Oaks, a relaxing place for seniors to be seen and not heard.  But Carl, with a lifetime of experience handling helium balloons and that fantasy about Paradise Falls, makes other plans.  And the elderly-assisting, snipe-hunting  Russell, a dedicated and enthusiastic (but terribly urban) Wilderness Explorer Scout, finds himself, accidentally, on the same journey.<br /><br />And this is all in the first 10 minutes!<br /><br />Ed Asner is the voice of Carl, and  Jordan Nagai is Russell.  These are well-matched voices with the characters, and the evolution of Carl and Russell throughout this story is touching, comical, and uplifting.  Dug, the speaking dog (it will make sense in the story), is a perfect sidekick - SQUIRREL!<br /><br />So who will like this movie?  If you are not really a fan of animated movies, the unique story may still be worth the investment of time.  It's a movie for all ages, and all cultures.  In fact, you probably have to be dead NOT to enjoy it!<br /><br />Don't let go of your dreams.  Love as if every day is your last.  Look for adventure.  Keep those promises.  And...<br /><br />SQUIRREL!</p></body></html>

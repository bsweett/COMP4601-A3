<meta name="summary" content="Not exactly the Iliad, but a pretty good movie nonetheless."></head><body><p>I finally got around to watching this one over the weekend, and quite frankly, I enjoyed it immensely.  I was left with a profound hollowness in my gut when the film ended -- which is precisely the effect any worthwhile Greek tragedy should have.  I realize that most of this movie's loudest critics highlight its rather pronounced divergence from Homer's classic Greek epic, The Iliad, and they're correct.  However, I would remind viewers that this movie's credits include an appropriate disclaimer -- it is "inspired by" the Iliad, rather than "based on" it.  Those two words open up a broad range of artistic license, of which the producers obviously availed themselves.  Nevertheless, the main story line of the battle of Troy is readily identifiable.<br /><br />The story is not complicated.  Just when Sparta and Troy are trying to cement a peace treaty to end years of war between them, young Paris, a prince of Troy (an uninspired performance by Orlando Bloom), takes a shine to Helen, queen of Sparta and wife of its king, Menelaus.  When Helen chooses to return to Troy with Paris and his brother, the legendary Trojan general Hector (Eric Bana), Menelaus seeks the aid of his brother, Greek king Agamemnon, to get her back.  Agamemnon sees a golden opportunity to unite the strength of all the Greek kingdoms under his banner and to do the one thing which has always eluded him -- the capture of Troy.  Trojan king Priam (masterfully played by Peter O'Toole) accepts the risk of war and chooses to stand behind his sons, trusting in his gods and the walls of Troy to protect them.<br /><br />Helen's face does, indeed, launch a thousand ships, bearing to the shores of Troy the largest Greek army ever fielded.  The Greeks quickly find, however, that the Trojan walls are just as impregnable as they have always been, and that Hector's leadership is brilliant.  Agamemnon is forced to turn to his unpredictable and uncontrollable ally, the mighty warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) and his band of Myrmidons.  Achilles brings a heroic dynamism and leadership to every battle, and literally makes the difference between victory and defeat for the giant Greek army.  In the many (very well done) battle scenes, Achilles reminds the viewer of a Cuisinart as he whirls and dances with deadly speed and precision among his enemies.<br /><br />But Achilles is a tormented man.  He is portrayed as the ultimate warrior, a veritable killing machine whose only code is death.  Legend has it that, as an infant, Achilles was dangled by his ankle and dipped into the River Styx, thereby becoming invulnerable to death.  Brad Pitt, in my opinion, did a fine acting job in this role, bringing depth and dimension to this complex character.  On the one hand, he is a cold ruthless killer, but on the other, he demonstrates a deep love, and grief, toward his young cousin Patroclus, and a strange tenderness and protectiveness toward Briseis, the young priestess he captures in an early battle.  He also shows an intense honor in his dealings with Priam and Hector, and even spares the life of a Trojan soldier who states simply, "Please, I have a son."  Frankly, this is probably the best role I have seen from Brad Pitt so far.<br /><br />The legends go on to tell of the Trojan Horse, and of Achilles' heel -- the one part of his body that wasn't dipped in the Styx.  Those legends play out forcefully and credibly on the screen, and leave the viewer struck by a deep sense of tragedy and loss as the story closes.  The entire film is one of heroism, nobility and action as the legends are brought vividly to life.  The settings and the battles are realistic and gritty, and the special effects are well done.  Maybe it's not true to Homer's original story, but if you can get past that I think you'll find that this is a wonderful tale in its own right.</p></body></html>

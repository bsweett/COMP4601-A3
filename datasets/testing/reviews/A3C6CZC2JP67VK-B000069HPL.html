This movie had me cracking up.I saw similarities between this movie and the company I use to work in.<br />Mike Judge had created a hilarious masterpiece from the beginning to the end in "Office Space". It makes you take a second look at Corporate America and see all the flaws it has. Ron Livingston is great as the tired of it worker, while Jennifer Aniston is very likeable as his girlfriend. I thought the whole Michael Bolton thing was hilarious, as was the murdering of the office equipment in the open field. Gary Cole played his role as annoyingly as anyone could have, and John C. McGinley was funny as the new staff hand. This movie should have done well at the box office, but anyone who's seen it knows how good it really is.  This movie is definitely worth having.</p></body></html>

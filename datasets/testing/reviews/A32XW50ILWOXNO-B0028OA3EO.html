<meta name="summary" content="Echoes of Kubrick. A marriage of myth, iconography and movie magic."></head><body><p>Roaring, triumphant, stirring visual poetry - this is "Superman Returns," a stunning piece of pop art celebrating a comic book superhero as more than a psychological headcase - although there's some of that in Bryan Singer's film - but as an icon that bridges the gap between, yes, Earth and the universe - the mystery that surrounds its vastness and God. Yes, it's underwritten - loose ends dangle about. And it's not very funny. And it's not "action-packed." And aside from Kevin Spacey's work as Lex Luthor, the performances are more about the look of the actor than the acting itself.<br /><br />But so were many of Stanley Kubrick's later films, when the director communicated a narrative beyond the script, marrying film, sound, music and editing into mesmerizing sequences that simply held you, alert and aware of the scene's resonance and singularity - it was like so much, and yet nothing like those things. It's exuberant and risky to compare Singer to that standard - his "X-Men" pictures were competent, nothing more - but the last hour of this film reaches for that titanic light and grasps it with a somber, beautiful tone that seeks to comment on nothing less than the fate of our souls.<br /><br />Using same credit titles from the original "Superman" and "Superman II," "Superman Returns" begins with the destruction of the planet Krypton, which Superman (Brandon Routh) despite knowing its fate, seeks out anyway, leaving Earth for five years to find it "a graveyard" and returning to more or less resume duties - and a relationship with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). But Lois has moved on to a decent boyfriend (James Marsden, again the other man) and a son (Tristan Lake Leabu), of whom, it is now known, is the son of Superman.<br /><br />The early acts of the screenplay by Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty concern themselves more with Luthor's plan to reconfigure Earth with Krypton crystals, which he finds can create new (if pretty uninhabitable) landmasses for his control. Spacey has reworked Luthor as a soulless, humorless but convincing demon who picks at the flaws of Superman while erecting a hell on Earth over which he can reign. His moll, Kitty (Parker Posey) is a mouthy dim bulb and his collected henchmen are, thankfully, more fearsome than idiotic. One experiment with the crystals causes an accident aboard an Airbus jet that Lois is on, and Superman's "return" is to save it and, in the process see Lois again.<br /><br />Routh is no Olivier, or even Christopher Reeve, but then Singer's doesn't require it; in fact, needs Routh to be just what he is. Superman is upright and quiet, burdened by human psychosis but not racked with it himself, content to let his deeds and warmth speak on their own. He makes an effort to woo to Lois away from her boyfriend, but it is not a fierce one. Bosworth makes a cute, likable Lois, smart and insecure, a trembler who marches forth anyway, and is drawn to Superman's certitude. She won a Pulitzer for writing an editorial about "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman," which of course is a substitute for a father, or God, or absolute authority. Superman really stands in as an angel sent by father Jor-El (Marlon Brando, in voiceovers from the original "Superman") to save "a good people, who wish to do well." An angel who complicates his existence by loving one of them.<br /><br />And we are them. Through Lois, and her boyfriend, Singer charts our relationship with the myth. Through Luthor, he presents an eloquent, brutal argument - just look what "goodness" Superman's home material will bring us. "God is a selfish being who share his powers," he says, prior to harnessing some of that power. Superman's rebuttal is a straight shot beyond Earth, to lend an ear to all the aggrieved who cry out, or to draw radiance from a blazing sun above the clouds. Singer presents these uncomplicated, pristine, wonderfully framed scenes at the right moments, capturing, in a blink, the relationship of a blessed son with his father, that son with the world, the son with himself. Better, at this stage in our cinematic capabilities, that the film doesn't bog itself down in the lengthy discourse required to explain Superman's pose to the world. More pointed and visually impacting to simply show it. Recalling "Batman Begins," the most memorable shot is that of Christian Bale, perched on a skyscraper at dusk, a sentry over the city. "Superman Returns" is full of that wonder, culminating in an extraordinary sequence that finds the Man of Steel saving the planet and falling back to it at an incalculable speed, rustling the trees of their mist upon his landing.<br /><br />Singer and cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel wisely forge these visuals with a darker palette borne out of the deep blues and pitch blacks of outer space. The final act of "Superman Returns" is set against an ocean storm and gray, monolithic structure that recalls the undersea Manhattan of Steven Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence." Otherwise, Metropolis glistens, and the Daily Planet seems to exist in a perpetual golden dust, Singer borrowing Kubrick's technique to airbrush the light into a furry haze, especially around Bosworth. The production and costume design is classic, snazzy and retro. The movie resonates with the mood of an earlier, innocent era, despite the stakes at hand. The look is warm and rapturous.<br /><br />It cuts a path that will stupefy some moviegoers, who will find it dry, save Spacey's performance as Luthor. A hardening of the culture, and a lack of intangible curiosity, will bring them to their boredom, so accustomed they've become to the overliterate and brainy scripts of recent superhero movies. "Superman Returns" has a deep subtext - spiritual, in fact - but it's a visual one; the screenplay is enough of a foundation to support the images, but Singer does not endeavor to mire his picture down in a pop culture sludge that makes it tastier.<br /><br />The result is action cinema of high order. It can be chilling - a piano duet between the boy and one of Luthor's henchmen. Or tragic - a severe beating of Superman on the krypton island. Or, in the climax, extraordinary. But so many of the scenes have the whisper of deep care behind them, of exquisite construction, of the hush of a late evening across the world. "Superman Returns" is a mournful, moody, wonderful thing. Its calm is rousing, and its universal perspective wise. Some myth all right.</p></body></html>

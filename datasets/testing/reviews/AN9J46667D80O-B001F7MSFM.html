The acting is quite good, the makeup and costumes are spectacular (and will probably get an Oscar nomination). The pacing is great, and the story is reasonably compelling.<br /><br />All of this, however, takes a backseat for me when compared to the incredibly beautiful scenes put up onto the screen by director Guillermo del Toro. Here is a man who, as previously demonstrated with Pan's Labyrinth,is someone who really understands the magic of cinema and its ability to show things no one has ever seen before.<br /><br />Consider, for example, the fate of the giant plant monster that attacks New York City. There's a number of ways the conclusion to the fight between it and Hellboy played out, but who would have expected such a beautiful end? And in a different way, look at what you get up on screen during the encounter with the Golden Army itself. Check out the Troll Market, which might rival the Cantina Scene in Star Wars for sheer creativity in makeup design. Marvel at the beauty of the Throne Room for the elves (marvel slightly less at the fact that the bad guy in the movie basically just another Sephiroth cosplayer).<br /><br />There is, as I said, some good acting, a good story, and some great dialogue in this movie, but what will stay in my mind are the incredible images up on the screen, and given what a visual medium film is, I'd say that's a pretty good thing.</p></body></html>

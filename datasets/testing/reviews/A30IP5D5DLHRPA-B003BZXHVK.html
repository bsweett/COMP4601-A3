There were many ups, but some downs that almost ruined the movie.<br /><br />So the pros.  The acting was nicely done, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and others did an above and beyond performance given the stigma of bad acting in Marvel pictures (ie: Fantastic Four).  I was very pleased with Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine as he assumed command during critical parts of the movie.<br /><br />As to the plot, the movie started out somewhat slow as events built up, then sped up dramatically and ended just as quickly.  It almost seemed as though the entire movie was being built up for this one final 15-minute showdown.  It was somwhat disapointing.  The plot also killed more main characters than a Quentin Terrentino movie as main heroes were almost being picked off from beginning to end, one by one.<br /><br />Lastly on the plot... I don't think X3 was meant as the finishing movie for the X-Men franchise.  The ending (like many trilogies try to do) sets you up for a sequel as Magneeto's ending has a cliffhanger and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS to see another one with another main character.  I think Stan Lee is setting us up for a sequel... and I was disapointed with how it was done.<br /><br />One of the other things I wish the director did was allow more time for character developement.  There were two characters I never caught the name of... until I read reviews online.  The two characters being Calypso and that girl that walked through walls... forgot her name again.  Also, there was no clarification on Wolverine's past.  Granted I watched the series, read the comics etc, etc and I know a little, but I think it would've been nice for the general audience.<br /><br />Then there's the consistency errors.  Any fans of the series knows that Juggarnut is technically NOT a mutant but apperantly he was taken down because his "powers" were leeched.  I was pleased, however, to see the producers remembered that Hank (Beast) likes to read upsidedown and to include the Danger Room.<br /><br />Pertaining to the visuals... nothing but impressive and the display of mutant powers was incredible.  I have officially dubbed Storm as the Sith Lord of the X-Men world... watch how she deals with her nemisis in the showdown to see what I mean.  They also showed the true form of Iceman, which was also nice and even Pyro's weapons.  For fans, this'll defintely make things more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The one real thing I wish was they had more Angel sequences since he was one of the first characters introduced in the introduction... and of course... I WANT GAMBIT!!  I don't care if Stan Lee says he's a shallow character, Gambit is awesome.<br /><br />All in all, an 85% and a solid movie to boot.  One worthy of my movie collection when it comes out on DVD.  The general audience, families and fanboys alike will enjoy this film if they STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS!!</p></body></html>

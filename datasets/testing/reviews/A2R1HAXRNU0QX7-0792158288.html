<meta name="summary" content="Classic movies all movie lovers should own!"></head><body><p>There are certain films that all lovers of movies should have on their must own collection.  Obvious choices might include THE GODFATHER, GONE WITH THE WIND, CITIZEN KANE, etc.  But RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (and its sequels to a lesser extent) should be there as a classic example of a classic adventure movie.  <p>And it is a great movie!  A joy to watch, even after all these years.  Harrison Ford is charming and an action hero for the ages.  Karen Allen is properly spunky.  The stunts are NOT aided by computer enhancement, and that gives them a visceral feel that all the &quot;stunts&quot; generated by computer for MATRIX RELOADED can't match.<p>TEMPLE OF DOOM and LAST CRUSADE are certainly lesser movies, but that's only because if RAIDERS is a 98 on a scale of 100, the others are maybe 85 &amp; 90. Still pretty darn good!<p>The DVD's are a treat.  The sound remix is FANTASTIC!  I have surround sound at home, and rarely has it been used to such great affect.  The explosions shook the walls!!  <p>True to Spielberg's form, there is NO commentary from him, which is always kinda a shame, but other than that, the extras are pretty good.  Remember, nowadays they make movies with DVD's IN MIND, so there are always cameras capturing everything, extra scenes filmed JUST so they can market the DVD later as having &quot;deleted scenes&quot; and so on.  INDIANA's movies were made in another time, so the extras may feel a bit sketchy.  What the heck...you don't but these movies for the blooper reel...you buy them to remember what good, clean, FUN adventure is all about.<p>ENJOY!</p></body></html>

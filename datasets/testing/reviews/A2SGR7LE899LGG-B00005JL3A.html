<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected."></head><body><p>Being a movie based on a videogame I had low expectations but right from the start it grabbed me and kept me glued to the screen. The movie hold a high level of tension and terror right from the opening scenes. It does get somewhat choppy at times but overall I really enjoyed this movie. The vhs video quality is excellent and the audio is top notch with a clear, dynamic and very deep low and upper ends. Overall: VERY GOOD.</p></body></html>

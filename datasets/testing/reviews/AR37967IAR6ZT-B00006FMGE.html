<meta name="summary" content="Great ... but way scary for young kids."></head><body><p>This movie is as good as the book on which it's based. It's surprisingly faithful, though I wish they'd have let the audience know more about Ginny Weasley's crush on Harry Potter. It's as good as the first movie, occasionally it's even better. <p>But the reason I'm writing this review is to warn people that, though &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is excellent cinema, some of it is downright scary. The spider chase scene is genuinely frightening, and moments involving a giant snake could be too much for little kids to take.<p>Watch it before you show it to younger kids. That way, you end up catching a good movie twice, and you can determine whether your kids should watch it at all.</p></body></html>

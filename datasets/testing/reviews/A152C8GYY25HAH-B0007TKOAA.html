<meta name="summary" content="Clever, insightful adult comedy/drama"></head><body><p>"Sideways" is an exceptionally fine comedy/drama for adults.<br /><br />This is the story of Miles and Jack [Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church]. Each has a mid-life crisis in full swing. Miles solution has been to become a wine expert, a pursuit that gives him intellectual satisfaction. Perhaps even better, it also gives him justification to drink a great deal. While Miles is still recovering from a bitter divorce, Jack's answer is to get married. Just before the nuptials, the guys take a road trip together to California's wine country. Miles, a frustrated writer, tries to teach Jack the intricacies of wine, but Jack is more interested in the intricacies of women. For him, the trip is just an excuse to have one last fling before settling down to married life. [We suspect Jack is just kidding himself!]<br /><br />Giamatti and Church are excellent. They create memorable characters. Equally memorable are Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh as Maya and Stephanie, the women the boys become involved with.<br /><br />"Sideways" is about equal parts drama and comedy, but it may be remembered more as a comedy because it contains many truly funny scenes. The movie remains true to itself right up to the ending, which is hopeful rather than happy.</p></body></html>

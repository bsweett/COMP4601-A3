It was funny, the visual effects have been much improved since the last Superman releases, the acting was very impressive, and the story has been moved forward in a way that fans have been begging for a very long time.<br /><br />But for a Superman movie there was a lot of talk, talk, talk, talk, talk... while leaving everybody waiting for the next bit of action.  The action does come, but in small little pieces that leave you wishing for more.  This movie does not give Superman the screentime to really show off his powers.<br /><br />I was also irked by some of the changes.  For instance, the phrase, "life, liberty, and all that stuff?"  What, is the American Way not good enough anymore?  And some of the comparisons between Superman and Jesus Christ were a little unsettling.  Christ is the founder of one of the largest religions on this planet, DC shouldn't be getting such an ego comparing their comic book character to him.<br /><br />I got the High Definition edition of Superman and was very disappointed.  The picture quality, while better than DVD, was not as good as most of the other DVD movies that I've picked up.  The lack of high definition was very surprising considering the money put into this movie.<br /><br />I hope they make a sequel, there is still a lot to learn and see from Superman.  And now that film technology has caught up (and bypassed) the imagination of DC comics I hope they don't delay on making more movies.</p></body></html>

This offering is fast-paced, high tech, very sexy - a wild ride from beginning to end.  I found it rather reminiscent of a James Bond movie, but much grittier and without a clearly defined enemy - at least early on.  One of the elements I most enjoyed was heavy sense of mystery that pervades the first half of the movie.<p>Matt Damon does a slightly above-average acting job as Jason Bourne, who doesn't even know his own name or identity when he is dragged half dead out of the Mediterranean by the crew of a French fishing boat.  The only clue about his past is a micro-laser embedded in his hip, which reveals the name of a bank in Zurich, along with a numbered Swiss account.  Weeks later, still no closer to overcoming his amnesia, he is put ashore and makes a beeline for Zurich, where he finds a safe deposit box containing a stack of passports in various names (one of which is Jason Bourne), as well as lots of cash and a gun.<p>Still quite confused but unsuspecting of any trouble, he heads to the American embassy with hopes of getting some answers.  His reception there, however, is less than cordial, and suddenly he finds himself the object of an intense manhunt for reasons he cannot begin to fathom.  To make matters worse, his pursuers obviously would rather see him dead than alive.  Thus begins a non-stop, pulse pounding race across Europe as Bourne tries both to stay alive and find out who he is and why so many people are after him.<p>Ultimately Bourne does figure out the answers to all his questions, but not before leaving in his wake a string of dead would-be assassins, along with a bunch of stymied police and covert operatives.  Unfortunately, he doesn't like what he finds out, and its clear that his past will never leave him alone.  This leaves the stage wide open for the sequel, "The Bourne Supremacy", which should hit the theaters quite soon.<p>Overall I thought this movie was extremely riveting and entertaining.  The acting wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't a liability either.  The story line definitely carries the movie, much more so than the actors.  If you haven't seen it, please do.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I can't wait to see the sequel.</p></body></html>

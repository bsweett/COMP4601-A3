But I still liked it - escapism at its best.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is beautiful even when thin; I enjoy Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor.  All three have great screen presence.  The action sequences were exciting even if not very believable.  I watched the theatrical version.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot and it kept me guessing (I figured out some of the plot twists but not all).  I would watch a sequel of this movie.<br /><br />My only small complaint - does anyone really think they can disguise Jolie when she has those lips sticking out in front of her?</p></body></html>

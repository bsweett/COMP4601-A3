<meta name="summary" content="What could be cooler than an Aston Martin with machine guns, wheel cutters, oil spreader, ejection seat, and bullet-proof shield"></head><body><p>This movie came out when I was 12 years old and I didn't get to see it until several years later.  But I still knew all about that cool Aston Martin and built a plastic model of it complete with a spring-loaded ejection seat that actually worked.  There was a rumor at the time that George Mahoney, who alternated between Democratic and third party Maryland gubernatorial candidacies, promised to equip the state police with vehicles of this sort if he were elected Governor.  This was in keeping with Mahoney's campaign slogan "Your home is your castle--protect it."  He would certainly have won the election if 6-18 year old boys had been able to vote!<br /><br />The movie has a simple but engaging plot that a twelve year old boy can appreciate--get the Red Chinese (as we called them then) to set off an atomic bomb at Fort Knox so that Goldfinger's own gold stockpile would increase in value--a sort of straightforward lesson in the law of supply and demand in economics!<br /><br />I was surprised many years later at the comment that my own 12 or 13 year old son made when he watched this movie with me on TV.  "He (James Bond) is not very interested in his job--or very good at it!"  This insightful observation comes from that fact that Bond is always being found out and captured by the bad guys (despite his fully-loaded Aston Martin and other fancy equipment)--and seems way more interested in bedding the various Bond girls than in the spy business!  This movie is still fun for me to watch, though--and to hear the irreverent observations of my children concerning it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT Cast-GREAT Movie"></head><body><p>L.A. Confidential, brings to the screen the story of a California police precinct in the 1950's.  The movie does a really good job of shedding light on American society during that period.<br /><br />Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Danny De Vito, Kim Basinger, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The plot, the setting, and the dialogues, are all WONDERFUL!<br /><br />Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br /><br />In conclusion, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.</p></body></html>

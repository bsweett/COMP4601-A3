Overall, the movie proves to be well directed and superbly acted by the entire cast. I have my doubts however on the script. It almost tries too hard to be fair to both sides of the fence. The movie uses Eric Bana's character, Avram as the moral compass of what the Israeli was trying to accomplished. Speilberg seem to be asking if the nation could compromised its morals and ethics standards to defend itself against her enemies. It would be nice if Spielberg actually answer that question but he does not. Funny how the man who directed one of the greatest movies on the Holocaust forget the past so easily.<br /><br />The movie proves to be well made, it could used little bit tighter editing if you asked me, the movie dragged from point to point thanks to Avram's moral self-doubts and interlude with his family. Inspired by a true story, I found the movie to be suspenseful, entertaining and overall, well crafted. Its flaws shouldn't bother most people who enjoyed this type of movie and the movie will leave you much to think about since the United States seem to be in the same position after 9/11 as Israel was after Munich Olympics.</p></body></html>

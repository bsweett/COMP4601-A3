<meta name="summary" content="No reason to watch this movie"></head><body><p>Same story, second verse. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason stars Renee Zellweger in her reprisal of the chunky, outspoken, good-hearted Jones. For several reasons, I thought this movie was a hit and miss endeavor. First of all, I couldn't understand why Jones was whining about boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) never fighting for her, considering he beat Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) to a pulp for her in the LAST movie. (Which incidentally, was only four weeks before the second movie begins. Apparently, fighting for Jones at least once a month is required.)<br /><br />Secondly, some quite preposterous plot turns (Being thrown in a Thai prison? That's a bit much for even my flexible suspension of disbelief.) made the whole movie pretty hard to swallow. Zellweger descends into pure slapstick, and the script takes every opportunity to make jokes at Jones' expense.<br /><br />The movie was okay, but I don't expect that another film following the escapades of Jones will be worth watching unless the formula is changed enough to allow for some relief.</p></body></html>

Romero, 2005)<br /><br />I'm not saying not to go see this movie. As a film that stands on its own, it's not a bad little thing, though it probably would have gone straight to video these days. Do you really need a plot synopsis? Stuff blows up. Lots of gory special effects get slung around. A rip-roaring, intestine-chewing good time is had by all. And yes, it is, in fact, a good time.<br /><br />But this is Romero. And this is the film that Romero has been wanting to make for two decades. It's reasonable to expect more than that. And it's not here. Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to say why that is without major spoilers as examples, but the majority of the film's great flaws, and they are great, have to do with continuity problems. Yes, I know I sound like an obsessed Trekkie when I say this, but I'm not talking about the guy with the red shirt on dying in Season 3 Episode 2 and showing up again with a hefty promotion in Season 5 Episode 6. I'm talking about the major development at the start of the movie, the big twist on which all other spoilers hang, having originally happened halfway through Night of the Living Dead. I spent the movie's next eighty minutes wondering how Romero could have managed to overlook that very basic fact, upon which the whole movie turns?<br /><br />As well, it's an ninety-three minutes long. It's not only the shortest film in the zombie quartet, but it's the second-shortest film Romero has ever made. I'd like to put it down to an exceptionally tight production schedule, I really would, because it seems so many of the movie's actors wouldn't have been utterly wasted in their roles given a longer running time. The two leads, Riley (Simon Baker, recently of The Ring Two) and Cholo (John Leguizamo of Spawn and To Wong Foo fame), are decently-drawn characters, though neither has the depth of character that categorized the major players in the earlier zombie films. Everyone else in the film, including female lead Asia (Scarlet Diva, b.Monkey) Argento, is utterly wasted. Again, about what you'd expect from a B-grade action horror comedy, and forgivable in the hands of most directors of such fare. But this is the guy who gave us some of the most enduring characters in horror film history. Why skimp now?<br /><br />Then there are the effects. I expected tameness when the film received an R rating, and I got it (though it should be noted that if you're watching closely enough, you'll see a "greatest hits" pastiche of deaths from the other films in the series throughout, which is numbly depressing on so many levels we won't even go there). What I didn't expect was that the zombie makeup that has characterized the zombies in Romero's films would have completely changed. The trademark blue-tinged zombie skin has disappeared completely.  The zombies in Land of the Dead are not nearly as unhuman, as they are in the series' first three films. This points to what may be the movie's greatest structural defect-- the lack of subtext. Romero's zombie films remain cinematic classics because they're not about the zombies, they're about the humans, and the underlying human condition. Each of the first three films in the series is so loaded with sociopolitical subtext that, looking back at them, I wonder how I missed it in my first go-round with each. I think it may be because those zombies are so alien. Romero had to work that much harder to get the subtext to work, and despite that, it's never delivered with the mallet-like cloddishness that is so rife in Hollywood message movies; they are nothing if not subtle most of the time. I'm not sure whether the more lifelike zombies were an attempt to not have to work that hard, but somewhere in the mix, the sociopolitical subtext took so much of a back seat that it was almost dropped. Sure, there are the haves and the have-nots in the human stronghold, and you could put together a small article on how the disparity between the two groups mirrors the same growing disparity in American culture today. But it would be a small article, and one that not many people would disagree with; it certainly won't inspire hours, if not days, of debate, like the earlier films, Dawn especially, did.<br /><br />But perhaps the most telling detail of how far the mighty have fallen I have saved for last, and I have to go back into obsessed-Trekkie mode, so take with whatever salt necessary. Kaufman, the head of the stronghold's "have" contingent, actually calls the walking dead "zombies" in this film-- the first time the word "zombie" has been used in the entire series. (This conceit is so much a part of the original three films, in fact, that Pegg and Wright used it as a semi-running gag in the wonderful Shaun of the Dead.) If you see that as a desecration, I have to warn you away from this movie. If you can shut your brain off and forget, for an hour and a half, that this was supposed to be the closing masterpiece in what is, arguably, the finest series of horror films ever made, then give it a go. **1/2</p></body></html>

One thing I've noticed throughout is Tarantino must be one of the biggest movie fans (he seems to thrive on the exploitive) I've ever seen, perhaps even bigger than me.  How do I figure this?  Because his films seem to be comprised of many other films, hucking parts of them into a blender, adding a dose of his own, skewed originality, a pinch of spunk (figuratively or literally, whichever you prefer), and hitting pur&eacute;e.  Many adore him, many hate him (I fall somewhere in-between), but for me, he does entertain, and what more could you ask (a lot, I suppose, but you probably ain't gonna get it)?  From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) features a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, and directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Sin City).  The film stars George Clooney (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Harvey Keitel (The Piano), Juliette Lewis (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), and Tarantino himself.  Also appearing is a myriad of notables including the very curvaceous Salma Hayek (Frida), Cheech Marin (The Shrimp on the Barbie), character actor Danny Trejo (Con Air), special effects artist and actor Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead), 70's blaxploitation star Fred Williamson (Hell Up in Harlem, Black Caesar), Michael Parks (Escape from Bogen County), John Saxon (Enter the Dragon), and Kelly Preston (Mischief).<br /><br />The film begins with two brothers, Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, on the run from the law.  Seems these two have been very bad boys, first robbing a bank, and then killing a number of law enforcement agents during their escape (the brothers being the ones escaping, not the law enforcement agents...geez, why would law enforcement agents be trying to escape?  Stay with me here).  As we spend time with the brothers, we learn that the killings probably occurred at the hands of Richard, as he seems to be on the violent and unstable side (great combo, by the way), while Seth appears to be the brains, and possessing a much more firm grasp on reality.  Anyway, the boys make it to Texas, their intent being to take the money from the bank job and live a life of luxury south of the border.  Only problem is the law enforcement types, especially angered at the death of a few of their own, have thrown up a dragnet, and are closing in on the pair.  Seeing their chances of making it across the border on their own ranging from slim to none (and slim just left town), the pair hitches a ride with Jakob Fuller (Keitel), his daughter Kate (Lewis), and Jakob's adopted son, in the family's recreational vehicle.  The group does manage to slip through the border, and end up in the seediest biker bar you'll ever see, where Seth and Richard await contact with an associate who'll take them to the promised land, that is if they can survive the night as the bar turns out to be the equivalent of a vampiric roach motel, humans check in, but they don't check out.<br /><br />I can see where this film might put some off, and I'm not just talking about the copious amounts of graphic violence (the film was actually toned down in this regard, if you can believe it.  Look for the deleted scenes in the special features section to see what was cut).  The movie starts off as one film (and action-type thriller), and then about an hour in, breaks off into an entirely different film (vampires, and those who kill them).  The transition isn't entirely seamless, but I went with it anyway.  Probably the best element in the film is George Clooney, as he not only has many of the best lines, but also delivers them in a convincing manner.  Harvey Keitel is certain worth watching, yet he seemed to take his part just a bit too seriously at times, in my opinion, but this was offset by Clooney and his underlying jovialness.  Lewis, whom I don't care for in general, did alright, and actually looked kinda cute, albeit a trifle skinny for my tastes.  Tarantino was probably the weakest element in the film, but at least he and director Rodriguez had the good sense to populate the film with enough talent to offset this factor.  If you're not a fan of the graphic violence, then you should avoid this one, as its loaded with visceral goriness (I read they decided to go with green blood for the vampires as to get much of the violence past the censors).  I thought the direction by Rodriguez to be very strong, as he kept the film rolling along at a swift pace, and set the mood wonderfully not only with well thought out shots, but also a lot of interesting and applicable musical selections.  I especially liked the song played during Selma Hayek's seductive dance routine.  It was as beautiful as the actress herself...and speaking of Hayek, I don't think I've ever seen anyone fill out a bikini as well as she does...that scene might be worth the price of the disk alone.<br /><br />The non-anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture is very good, and the audio is superior.  Special features include a commentary track by Tarantino and Rodriguez, along with ads, two music videos, outtakes, three featurettes, still gallery, deleted/alternate scenes, and cast/crew bios.  Also included is a 2nd DVD with a full-length feature titled Full Tilt Boogie, a film shot during the shooting schedule of From Dusk Till Dawn.  The film was followed by two direct to video sequels, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999) and From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000).  There is a box set with all these movies, but compare the price against the individual releases (I think the latter is cheaper).<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></body></html>

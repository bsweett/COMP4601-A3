<meta name="summary" content="Faithful adaptation of compelling novel"></head><body><p>Seldom does a casting director find better choices for leads in a film than Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley.  They perfectly capture the essence of the characters so richly detailed in the Dubus novel.<br /><br />As in life, the conflict in The House of Sand and Fog is not the product of good and evil. Rather, disagreement grows between two well-meaning characters whose goals in life can't co-exist. The two main figures, Kathy and Behrani, both lay claim to a house. Each views themselves as righteous and the other as evil (and both are correct from their own point of view). Viewers toggle between the two, as both are sympathetic and both have noble, honest intentions. Kathy loses her home when the tax office makes a mistake and seizes it from her. Behrani buys the house at an auction and re-invents his family's life in the little bungalow. Selling it back to Kathy at the tax office's price would cause him to lose considerable time and investment on the property.<br /><br />The film moves freely between the two characters, with each acting as hero during their "turn" and then being relegated to villain when the other character picks up the narrative.  The film's one fault is its inability to explore the minds of each character.  In the book, the novel was told from the first person point of view of Kathy and Behrani.  This allowed Behrani to discuss his history as an Iranian immigrant and Kathy to talk about her life as a recovering addict.  Without a voice-over narration, all this information is lost.<br /><br />As with the novel, the film's greatest strength is its depiction of the ambiguous nature of "being right". If the film were only Kathy's tale, Behrani would be a Mr. Potter-like capitalist demon, while Behrani's version would depict Kathy as a lazy, irresponsible and illogical American, consistent with those most immigrants encounter after moving to the USA and expecting to see Gary Cooper and June Cleaver in every home. Since both characters are sympathetic, the result creates conflict in the viewer. Who's right? Who should get the house? And at what cost?<br /><br />The rich characters provide a compelling inspection of the nature of human conflict (and a pretty good crash course in real estate foreclosure bureaucracy). After the conflict is established, however, the film becomes a bit too focuses on action and physical drama and goes on a bit too long. I preferred the cerebral clashes of the first part and was a bit disappointed when the blood started to splatter.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Many imitaters, no true successor"></head><body><p>Ever since its release back in 1979, Sam Raimi's &quot;ferciously original horror film (Stephen King)&quot; has stood in a class all its own simply because no movie has ever been able to truly succeed it. The film's only true superior is its immediate sequel &quot;Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn,&quot; but most of us already knew that, so we won't count that one in the grand scheme of things.<p>When &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; was released, it was so totally gory, repulsive, funny, and scary that people couldn't decide whether this was visionary-ahead-of-its-time-filmmaking or a total waste of brain cells. The more intelligent among us recognize it as art in a genre during which time was just being rebirthed, thanks to the success of John Carpenter's masterful &quot;Halloween,&quot; which paved the way for pretty much every horror film that came after it. But Raimi didn't do what most of the filmmakers of the eighties tried to do, which was to basically copy the &quot;Halloween&quot; formula down on paper and make a new script with it. No, he had something much darker in mind; something that dwelt within the woods and could be reawakened by the incantations of an ancient book: Nocturum de Morto - The Book of the Dead, later renamed Necronomicon Ex Mortis, which was later abused by producer Brian Yuzna for the awful H.P. Lovecraft film called &quot;Necronomicon.&quot; The book, which served as a passage way to the evil worlds of the beyond was translated and studied by Professor Raymond Knowby, who used a tape recorder to record the phonetic pronounciations of the book's passages, not fully knowing exactly what he was doing with it. The professor ended up dead (we assume) after his wife attempted to kill him while possessed. But the professor reveals one vital clue as to how to destroy the demons in human form: Bodily dismemberment. Do we actually see this? Yes we do, and it actually looks realistic enough to churn a stomach or two. Yet, despite all of this seriousness, the acting of the film is so purposely bad that we realize that we're seeing more than a horror film: This is a satire. &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; was not made in bad taste, as its more hateful critics hypothesized, but on the contrast, it is about bad taste, and about making fun of bad taste in a new way. Not only do we see evidence of this in the bodily dismemberment of one inhabitant of the cursed cabin, but in the &quot;raping&quot; of another, the stabbing in the ankle of yet another, and the decapitation of the same &quot;yet another.&quot; This movie is so full of Karo syrup and latex it would've been easy for it to get lost along the way, but Sam Raimi keeps the film along the same track the entire time, lighting the path with lanterns of dark humor, and it never steps wrong. At its center is a sympathetic Bruce Campbell performance, amazing camerawork for such a low budget, and enough gore for an entire room of blood-and-guts hounds. You gotta love it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Was what the first X-Men movie should have been"></head><body><p>Just as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a>, with all the action and origins that I expected, and wished had been, in the first X-Men movie. Although I DON'T like what they did with Deadpool. Talk about a drastic change from the comic! Still, a good comic book film. This was what I thought the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000078UJV">X-Men 1.5</a> movie should have been. I thought Bryan Singer's film was much too overrated and found it often boring at times; at least if paid off by the public receiving the awesome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVU">X2 - X-Men United (Widescreen Edition)</a>. And I hope they go through with the rumored Deadpool prequel/sequel movie they have planned; Ryan Reynolds is awesome!<br /><br />As much as I'm not too crazy over Marvel characters (with the exception of Daredevil and the Punisher), I do find Wolverine as one of the most intriguing characters in the Marvel universe, even though he is a bit overexposed. He is interesting the same sense as Superman in that he hardly ages and can not be killed by conventional methods. How would that affect someone? While the topic for both Superman and Wolverine can be dark, it is Supes that takes it lighter than Wolverine. Supes sees death and destruction (very rarily, but sometimes, by his hand and because of him), and while every living being's death does bother him, he has the inner strength to let go of things past and look to the "big picture." Wolverine, however, sees nothing but death and destruction (often by his own hand or because of him), and it plagues him to no end, even though he pretends to not care. Supes has the convenience of understanding that his alien biology causes his remarkable powers -- it's who he is, it's how he was born. On the other hand, Logan's power (his bone claws and regenerative healing) while being from his mutant-born gene, are outweighed by his violated feelings about the adamantium fused to his skeleton as well as the memory tampering by the Weapon X program (that's where the movie differs from the comic: Logan did not volunteer for the adamantium Weapon X operation).<br /><br />They've already announced a sequel for this film, and are having some of the story take place in Japan, no doubt showcasing either Logan's 1937 run-in with Ogun, in 1945 where he finds love with a girl in Hiroshima, or post-WWII where he conceives a child with Itsu. Even though all take place before the Weapon X program, it still would be great material to see on screen.<br /><br />Look for appearances by Agent Zero, Deadpool, John Wraith, Blob, a young Cyclops, Silver Fox, Emma Frost, Gambit, and Sabretooth. Overall a good job from Marvel Studios!</p></body></html>

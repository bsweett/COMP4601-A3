<meta name="summary" content="A very fine film of events most of us remember, but what happened behind the public scenes"></head><body><p>This really is a very good movie and I think Helen Mirren is wonderful in this performance.  Frankly, I prefer her portrayal of this Elizabeth to her fine performance of the first Elizabeth.  Of course, this is a more personal and private story and it is the intimacy without all the accoutrements of history that I enjoyed so much.<br /><br />I suppose it helps to have at least a passing understanding of the British system of government, its society, and the function of the Queen and the Royal Family.  If you are a thoroughgoing Republican (in their sense - that is anti-monarchist) you probably cannot work up much interest or sympathy for the Queen and much of what the movie offers will simply not be available to you.  So, I hope you can see her as a woman, a real person, who is in this position in her government and in history.  Notice how she came to the throne as a very young woman (only talked about, but not shown in the movie - but can be found on the BBC website).<br /><br />The story centers around the events of the coming to power of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as Prime Minster and the death of Princess Diana.  The Queen, being raised during more austere times, particularly the furnace of the Second World War, did not believe in public displays of emotion or grieving.  Add to that the fact the Diana was really no longer a member of the Royal Family when she died.  It was felt that her death was a private affair.  The Queen and her family are steeped in tradition and were following its protocols perfectly.  They in no way were intending to minimize or insult Diana's memory.  Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is quite supportive of tradition and the Queen, but seems quite oblivious to the world outside the grounds of Balmoral or the other palaces.<br /><br />What they did not appreciate was the way the public had taken Diana to its collective heart.  She was a celebrity even more than royalty and the public felt a loss that required the Queen to participate in a new way.  According to the movie, it was Tony Blair, with some help by Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), who played the key role in helping them understand this new requirement.  It was actually a new and heavier burden the public placed on the Royal Family, but the public did not and does not care.<br /><br />I especially liked the way Tony Blair grows in appreciation for Elizabeth and the way she fulfills her role.  The pressures of being Prime Minister almost certainly contributed to that appreciation.  A key scene is when his staff is bashing the Queen yet again and Blair has had enough and sets them straight about the appreciation they should have for her.<br /><br />The most touching scenes are when the Queen is driving her Land Rover around her estate wearing her royal scarf over her hair and being as close to a normal person as she can ever be.  Fascinating.  Another touching scene is her appearance outside the gate viewing the huge displays of flowers and notes the public left for Diana outside Buckingham Palace.  The Queen maintains her public dignity as she reads some very insulting remarks about her and her family, but we know how much this wounds her.<br /><br />The filmmakers have woven actual footage of the actual events into the movie itself and it is amazingly well done and does add to the sense of immediacy of the story.  Anyone who remembers the actual events will still be drawn in by the movie's Tony Blair talking within footage that is matched carefully to the surrounding actual footage contemporary to Diana's death.<br /><br />A very good movie and wonderfully worth seeing.</p></body></html>

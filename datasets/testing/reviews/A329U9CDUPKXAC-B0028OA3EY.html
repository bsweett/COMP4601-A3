It's pretty obvious that Brandon Routh can't act. Bryan Singer barely gave him any lines at all and when he did speak, it was wooden. Brandon most likely got the part because he looked the part. But it probably would have been wiser to go with someone who can act. The storyline is just terrible. If and when there is a next one, it should start out with Superman waking up and everything that happened in this movie was all just a dream. He should not have a son. People don't want to see Superman as a daddy. And the kid has absolutely no purpose in this film. Other than throwing a piano. And Lois Lane's boyfriend is a drag. Lex Luthor is handled very poorly. He somehow figures out a way to raise an island from out of the ocean which will then flood much of the world and kill "billions." Well...the island does come up out of the water but nobody is flooded at all. There's one little wave and that's it. If you want to see a good, 3 dimensional villain, just look at Ian McKellen's Magneto in the X-Men films. Bryan Singer did a much better job with those movies than he did with Superman.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="typical,but well done"></head><body><p>denzel is a competent actor and very rarely gives into stereotypical roles(RAPPERS TAKE NOTE!!!!!!!!!).here he gives an earnest portrayal of a down to his last quarter drunken body guard.it seems over a decade of military sanctioned killing has sapped''creasy-the charactors name''of his humanity and self motivation.he is however in need of''work''and seeks out an old buddy played by a calm christopher walken.in mexico,body guards are a necessity not unlike cell phones.so creasy is told of a family needing someone to guard their young daughter played fairly well by ms fanning.director tony scott spent a little too much time developing the relationship between body guard and child.she melts away his''im not your friend,so no questions'' facade on cue and they get all cutesy soon after.but once the actual kidnapping occurs(some 65 minutes into the movie,cause for a 1 star deduction)things get moving.i have stated in other reviews about my not liking the 1 man against many genres and theres where another star is deducted.denzel is bumrushed while waiting for dekota to finish up her piano lesson.recovering in a hospital after being left for dead,denzel recovers and begins his tearing apart of those who kidnapped the kid mission.yes he gets the prerequisite inside help from a reporter and a federale besides c.walken.and of course the help is on the money.where no one else was able to crack the kidnapping ring in all of the decades they have been around,all it took was denzel getting shot up and his charge taken to get things done(of course i deducted a star for this).there is a twist here that i didnt really see coming(1 star returned).its a spoiler so stop reading .....NOW.it turns out that marc anthony,dekotas father set up the kidnapping along with the help of crooked police to gain money.the plan was to hijack the ransome drop off so marc anthony's charactor didnt have to live a lie of wealth any longer.turns out he was flat broke and living on fumes.it was supposed to be an easy score but alas......anyway,things get mucked up and lives are ruined.the movie connected the dots nicely and ended with yet another twist....SPOILER TIME......the kidnappers reported the child dead after the bungled ransome ripoff.but they lied.they didnt kill her because they are''professionals''.they were going to ransome the kid off to someone else i suppose.the movie is 40 minutes too long but thankfully not on marc anthony's rat-like mug.a good movie overall.</p></body></html>

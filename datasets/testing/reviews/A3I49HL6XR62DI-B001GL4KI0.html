<meta name="summary" content="Ultra allegory"></head><body><p>Ultra Violet is an allegory about how a totalitarian regime creates a social class of scapegoats -- in this case, the hemophages or "vampires" -- upon whom it blames all social ills in the relentless, cold quest for absolute political power. Milla Jovovich is intense, stylish and effective and surprisingly touching as the hemophage woman willing to sacrifice everything for a little boy who could be the savior of her diseased people. Visually stunning and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

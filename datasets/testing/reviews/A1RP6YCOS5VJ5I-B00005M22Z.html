The film is very original, that's the best part of the entire thing. You have never seen or heard things that this film is showing and saying.<br /><br />The Stargate itself is a really cool thing to look; very good special effects are all over the movie. From the ships to the wardrobe, this film looks amazing. The story is also very compelling and very interesting. An alien, posed as their god Ra, kidnapping humans from Egypt way in the past and has made them slaves...what's cooler than that? The characters are also people you actually care about. Kurt Russell and Spader do an excellent job in the film. Overall, this film is another that to be seen to be believed. It really is hard to describe and has to be seen!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could have been so much better!"></head><body><p>Once Upon a Time in Mexico was bit of a disappointment, considering how successful Desperado had been.  Antonio Banderas is back in this sequel, but the movie hardly lives up to the expectations produced by the first film.<br /><br />The casting is very good, but the plot is just average.  Salma Hayek, though an asset in any film, portrays a mere memory... to the point that it wouldn't have made that big of a difference if she was absent altogether; if anything, it probably would have been better that way.<br /><br />Despite its flaws the movie does have that strongly Mexican flavor and that distinct humor which has become so characteristic of these films.  (The scene with the "Mexi-can" and the "Mexi-can't" was hilarious!)<br /><br />Both Johnny Depp and Antonio Bandera as well as the rest of the cast do a very good job in trying to cover up for the mediocre plot.<br /><br />Overall, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a good film to watch, but not to expect any masterpiece in the making.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A wild ride!"></head><body><p>This giant film will remain in the memory as one the ten best films of this decade. The astonishing and frenetic rhythm shake hands with an original approach of the underworld in Los Angeles told with cynicism, tension, humor and extreme violence. A true universe of dissipated and out of their minds characters will constitute a true portrayal of a real social  kaleidoscope or human puzzle if you want.<br /><br />The hyper kinetic and the breathtaking dynamic of this movie make of it an obligated reference at the moment to consider the attitude in Cannes respect Hollywood where the Film was a winner. Once more the antique statement : "No one is prophet in his land."<br /><br />The film shot the career of three actors: the lovable and attractive Uma Thurman, John Travolta and Samuel Jackson.<br /><br />An instantaneous cult movie from its first release. Mesmerizing all the way.</p></body></html>

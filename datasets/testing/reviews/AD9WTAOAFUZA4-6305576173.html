<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Brooks, WIlder, and Kahn"></head><body><p>Inspired beyond words, "Young Frankenstein" ranks with "Blazzing Saddles" and "The Producers" as Mel Brooks' finest contributions to film.  And, we must be grateful for his mettle, his moxie and unparalleled genius as he romps his way through the classic Monster tale of all time.  Marty Feldman is indelible and unforgettable as Igor, the irreplaceable Madeline Kahn won an Oscar Nomination, and the film served as comedic landmarks for the lieks of Terri Garr ( Tootsie) and the legendary Gene Hackman.  Some scenes are side-splittingly funny, and others lighthearted and tender in the way only Brooks and Wilder could possibly pull off.  In fact, Wilder deserves a lot of praise as Mel Brooks' "everyman" though he can sometimes play the role so straight, he loses himself to the kooks all around him.  "YOung Frankenstien" is perhaps his best Brooks character if for no other reason than he is equally looped out and bizarre, part Willy Wonka, part nerdy gunslinger.  He's hilarious and gentle here, in a movie that will tug your heart even while you're coughing it up laughing!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What Lies Beneath?"></head><body><p>Harrison Ford is in unfamiliar territory in this tense, exciting supernatural thriller, helmed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway). The film has some really effective shocks and twists, with sharp editing and Alan Silverstri's increasingly creepy score. The numerous homages to Hitchcock films are nicely done, and Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer fit well together as a married couple. And with a great story, Zemeckis weaves his magic to full terrifying effect.<p>Originality, however, is not it's strong point, as we are greeted to creaky doors, sudden thunder, dogs barking before something scary happens and so on. But the main plot provides some great shocks and creepy moments throughout the film.<br />The added CGI creates a really spine-chilling feel to the movie, and by the end leaves you chilled, yet satisfied. This is a truly great film, and an awesome DVD. Prepare yourself for a great night in.</p></body></html>

First, romantic comedy is something I really don't like admitting to enjoying, (no matter how many guns they have). This movie was a pleasant surprise, and I had a real hoot watching it, (and many times since).<br /><br />The humour is verbal with some very good lines, but this is also made punchier by the plethora of situational gags exploiting the contexts they are used it. Sounds dull and dry the way I say it, but what it amounts to is a complex comedy that works. The tentative questions about "how many" are given a whole new twist with the Smiths.<br /><br />Pitt and Jolie have an on screen chemistry that works in most scenes. There are a couple of fizzled points, but for the most part, they really spark well and add to the laughs. Jolie's line "Are you still alive, Baby?" is a classic. Pitt once again demonstrates his ability for comedy, and Jolie also has a knack for it.<br /><br />Having two enemy assassins married to each other was an inspired innovation, and it really goes off with people like Pitt and Jolie in the lead roles. Vince Vaughn still plays much the same character as in other movies such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BKVQRU">Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006419IM">Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story (Widescreen Edition)</a>. That sort of "I'm ok, you're ok" guy that Vaughn seems to do well with, recently.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie. I think I may have to admit that romantic comedy may be something I like. Bummer.</p></body></html>

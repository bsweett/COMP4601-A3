<meta name="summary" content="Decent Action Fare with Dystopic Trappings"></head><body><p>Children of Men--the story of a future society struck barren, the chaos that ensues, and one man's struggle against all of that--feels like a high-speed, thrill-ride through a dark, shadowy wood. It is something like a fairy tale of the old school variety; once Clive Owen leaves the path and wanders into the trees, he falls from danger to danger.<br /><br />I am told that the movie is dystopic, in the tradition of Orwell, Huxley, Rand and Levin. I'm told that it has a strong political bent. I don't find either of these claims to be particularly true. While it is the case that the film is set in a future-gone-bad, the movie rarely stops long enough to catch its breath to develop any real philosophical or political messages, and that's what I find distinctive about the great dytopias of the 20th Century. They were trying to identify trends in society that would lead us all to ruin. Children of Men, on the other hand, introduces a out-of-left-field plot element to bring us low (making all women barren), and then just uses the setting as a dark backdrop for, what is, essentially an action flick.<br /><br />Oh, along the way, we might argue that the film is in favor of, say, immigration rights or the legalization of marijuana, or such, but these do not form any particular, actual indictment against the society presented, here. They are simply little political statements included, as one might incorporate a product placement by having a character drink a can of Coke. (The reason why the immigration rights thing doesn't constitute an 'indictment against the society' is because it isn't clear that the government is wrong in what it's doing: given the barrenness thing, and if the rest of the world has truly collapsed, as is suggested, then England's immigration policy might be actually fairly sensible policy in order to prevent complete anarchy. It is hardly Orwell's doublethink.)<br /><br />At the end of my longwinded rambling, what I'm trying to say is this: for all of its trappings, this is an action movie. It's a decent action movie, terribly gritty and high-impact, with a dark palette and lots of bleakness and paranoia.<br /><br />While I respect the film, I didn't walk away feeling particularly good about anything (the name of the boat did little to lift my spirits). I don't believe I would want to see it again, and I don't think I would recommend it to you.<br /><br />Three stars.</p></body></html>

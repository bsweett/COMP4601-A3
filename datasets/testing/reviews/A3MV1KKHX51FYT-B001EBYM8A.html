<meta name="summary" content="The Legend of a Wrongful Conviction"></head><body><p>The film opens with a woman being attacked; we learn it is the wife of Dr. Richard Kimble. The police take the husband in for questioning. They had been at an event, and Dr. Kimble was called to the hospital, leaving his wife alone. There was an attack by a one-armed man; his wife's death leaves him rich. Dr. Kimble is convicted for her murder and sentenced to death. (This is based on the 1960s TV series.) The surprise in this movie is not in the ending, but the events that lead to the ending. The legend of a Doctor wrongly convicted is based on the real case of Dr. Sam Sheppard.<br /><br />As an action suspense story, this is excellent! It is set in the Chicago area, probably because Cleveland would have no part of this story. Marshall Gerard shows up to personally take over the investigation, and search for the fugitive. Dr. Kimble's escape in cold weather reminds me of the similar escape of Rambo. Dr. Kimble hides in the urban jungle. The pacing keeps the fugitive one jump ahead of his pursuers. When he is trapped in the tunnel, Dr. Kimble goes underground (literally). Gerard is relentless for a man who "doesn't care". Dr. Kimble escapes with a desperate leap into the air. We then follow Dr. Kimble as he attempts to search for the real killer, like in a detective story.<br /><br />This story was updated to reflect the business world of the 1990s, and its many scandals. Professional rivalry could not be mentioned in the 1960s. This is a film that can be watched and enjoyed every year. I wonder if that ethnic neighborhood was chosen for some significance? The parade in the street reminded me of the scene in "Blow Out" or "The Net". The film does not tell of Dr. Kimble's future. Will Dr. Kimble face the same problems that Dr. Sheppard faced after his acquittal? We hope not.</p></body></html>

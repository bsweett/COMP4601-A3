<meta name="summary" content="AGED CLASSIC"></head><body><p>Much has been said about "Night of the Living Dead" for the last 37 years. Of course it's one of the classic horror flicks that will be remembered for a very long time. It's not just fun (in a "horror" meaning of this word) it has a social message, it was rather important for that time and now also - I'm talking about the whole Romero's trilogy (quadrilogy now) - you all now about its anti-racist, anti-consumer and so on aspects. "Night of the Living Dead" is still topical. BUT.<br /><br />Old movies sometimes are hard to percept today. They seem a little bit naive and funny. The same thing I guess happened to Romero's classic. Nowdays it's not that scary and shocking as it was in 1968. Maybe I'm wrong and some people still find it the way it was then. Well, good for them. But I think there are some who think like me and who can't watch old films without making allowance for time. I watched it three times and each one I found myself being a little bored.<br /><br />Again I repeat it is a great movie of a great cinematographic and panhuman value, it's in my top 10 of the greatest horror flicks of all time, but I doubt you'll be watching it for a couple times a year. Maybe two or three times like me. Tom Savini's remake look much more up-to-date.<br /><br />What I have no doubt about is that it's neccessary to have it in your collection even if you are not an avid horror fan. "Night of the Living Dead" is one of the movies that changed cinematography forever and although it might not be perceived as 40 years ago, it's still worth time and money.</p></body></html>

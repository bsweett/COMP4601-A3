<meta name="summary" content="Star-studded mosaic of human emotion and chance."></head><body><p>&quot;Magnolia&quot; is a film of the highest regard, taking on a massive amount of story and turning it into three hours of nothing but real-to-life scenarios and themes. These experiences are embedded in the lives of various people who we are intoduced to throughout the movie, who quietly and outwardly affect one another's lives throughout the course of a single day. This is done with the utmost precision and intelligence in storytelling and brilliance, providing an intriguing and mesmerizin look into their lives. There is not a single theme left untouched, a certain lifestyle or event unturned, and in its slow and building narrative, I found myself wanting to know more about these peoples' lives instead of becoming bored with it. ... <p> The cast, the moving ways in which the script manipulates them, and the overall effect are outstanding, making this the best picture of 1999.</p></body></html>

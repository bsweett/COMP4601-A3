<meta name="summary" content="HOSTEL ..A GORY GOOD TIME!!"></head><body><p>Hostel starts off rather slow posing as a dark sex comedy with random laughs and plenty of t&a (breast and rear nudity) ..as three men venture to another country on vacation, their want(s) for casual sex lead them to a strange and macabre part of the world that most movie goers hope doesnt really exsist. As the plot progressed i realized that a bloodbath was around the corner. The film soon reveals that it is about human torture and the price some insane people will pay to be givin the opportunity to torture and kill a foreigner. As I watched the movie I glanced next to me at the elderly woman to my right, she appeared to be disgusted by the film and its harsh sexual dialogue, nudity and graphic gory violent content. I tell you this because i don't recommend the film to senior citizens and children whom i saw plenty of in the theater today.. However, I do recommend it to adult horror fans that love a gross good time at the movies!!</p></body></html>

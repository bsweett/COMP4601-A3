<meta name="summary" content="Clearly the greatest of the Star Trek films"></head><body><p>As a viewer that prefers the original cast films (and TV shows), I am unapologetic about calling Star Trek II the greatest Trek film, and with the passing of Deforest Kelly, it will remain the greatest.  It has everything Trek fans could want: a great villain, space battles, morality conflicts, humour, and, of course, William Shatner chewing up the scenery.  <p>The best "Original Series" shows contained a mixture of philosophy and action, both of which are readily apparent here.  The story: The exiled Khan escapes by hijacking a starship, then sets out to revenge himself on Kirk.  Along the way he learns of the Genesis Project, basically a super-fast terraforming process that would render lifeless worlds habitable in mere days.  The problem - if used where life already exists, it would wipe out that life and rearrange it to fit its new pattern (this is why the Klingons come after it in ST III).  The action follows Khan's parallel schemes to kill Kirk while stealing the Genesis device.  The philosophy arises from Spock and McCoy's debates on the merits of the Genesis Project, as well as Kirk coming to terms with aging (he gets reading glasses and meets his now-adult son who hates him).<p>The acting is what you'd expect from the likes of Ricardo Montalbahn and William Shatner - emoting galore!  But it works because director Meyer has arranged the film as a melodramatic space opera.  Meyer also includes some nice touches, such as piping aboard flag officers, standardised uniforms, and other naval touches.  Curiously, the two antagonists never meet in the flesh (and therefore the actors never worked together); perhaps this is more realistic: after all, Villeneuve and Nelson never went 1-on-1 at Trafalger.  Thus, Meyer's fusion of age-of-sail naval fighting with science fiction has a neat feel of authenticity.  Finally, the score is probably the best of the ST films.<p>This DVD edition is certainly worthy of the quality of the film.  There are numerous extras, from documentaries on the effects and set designs, to the fascinating text commentary by Jan Okuda.  Meyer lends some nice insight in his audio commentary as well, although he sounds more like a scriptwriter (which he also does, but not on this film) than a director.  With a cost that is little more than a normal DVD, it's also great value.  But the absolute highlight is the suit that Leonard Nimoy is wearing in the extra "Original Cast Interviews."  It has to be seen to be believed!</p></body></html>

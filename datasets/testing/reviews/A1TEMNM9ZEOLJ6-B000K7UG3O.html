<meta name="summary" content="Basically a cartoon"></head><body><p>No one in this romantic comedy vehicle rings the slightest bit true. All are cartoonish figures, as is the premise of a 30 something guy who can't move out of his parents' house. At least the upscale interiors are fun to look at. McConaughey's teeth are unnaturally white, which is also annoying. One does get the feeling his character is closest to him in real life, given his gallivanting with buddy Lance Armstrong. I didn't laugh at anything here, but at least it moves along at a relatively brisk pace.</p></body></html>

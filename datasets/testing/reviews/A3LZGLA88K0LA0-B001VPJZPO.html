<meta name="summary" content="DOIN THE HOODOO THAT YOU DO"></head><body><p>Rich in Southern Gothic atmosphere, THE SKELETON KEY is a spooky little movie, far from perfect, but above average for the recent spate of horror films---and it's NOT A remake!!<br /><br />Kate Hudson gives a good performance as a young woman who takes on the hospice responsibilities for a recent stroke victim (John Hurt, effectively eerie).  His wife, well played by the dependable Gena Rowlands, has hired Hudson to take care of her husband until he passes on.  It's not long, though, before Hudson suspects something is going on in the creeky old manor.  She stumbles upon a secret room that strongly hints of hoodoo practice.  Without relying on gore or violence, SKELETON KEY moves eerily along with a twist ending you may not see coming.  Peter Sarsgaard also stars as a young lawyer who tries to help Hudson through.  THE SKELETON KEY is a stylish thriller with enough jolts to keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></body></html>

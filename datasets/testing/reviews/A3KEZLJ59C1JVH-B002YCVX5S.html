The film branches off into several interconnected storylines, all of which are fantastic and interesting. The cast is fantastic and the story itself is a good one, but I thought the movie was a bit too long and was very anticlimactic at the end. I'm glad I didn't see this in the theatres because I would have been disappointed, but it's worth checking out on cable or DVD.</p></body></html>

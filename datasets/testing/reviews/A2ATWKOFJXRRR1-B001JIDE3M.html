<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Diversion ...But Purists Beware!"></head><body><p>It'd be tough to pin down exactly how many times JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH has been adapted to TV and the big screen, but a fairly accurate accounting might be "too many." I've been able to find at least eleven adaptations (a few of them foreign productions, but still productions). What's more puzzling is that in 2008 not one but TWO versions of the book made it to film. The first was a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MJ6HE">horrible television adaptation in January</a> starring Rick Schroeder (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I3RKO">Scrubs</a>). And the second is this supercharged action version starring Brendan Fraser (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKLW">Crash</a>) who's probably best known for his portrayal as Rick O'Connell in the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HQZJPM">Mummy series'</a> of films.<br /><br />The big question as to this particular Jules Verne story's appeal is obvious: Why? Why so much fanfare and Hollywood hype? Many people have been critical of Hollywood and their lack of originality, and if you use Journey to the Center of the Earth as a barometer to that affect, then you'd be absolutely correct; they have to keep reinventing old shtuff because they can't come up with anything else.<br /><br />Regardless of your take on originality, the one large positive that comes from these hyperbolic recreations is that it introduces a new audience to Verne's masterpiece. And the action in this one is really fun to watch on a big screen with 3-D images plunging into your vision.<br /><br />Although this edition is cool from a visual perspective, I still hold the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007JMD8">1959 version starring James Mason</a> as the penultimate adaptation. Quirky, funny, and outlandishly impossible (and in technicolor!), the `59 film was an adventure fantasy/SF film ahead of its time. At the 1960 Oscar's it was nominated for three awards, including special effects. I doubt this 2008 recreation will be so blessed. But...<br /><br />It is fun, however. You can't help but smile at some of the newly introduced lines ("What? You're thirteen, you can't calls dibs." -- when the two males in the party realized how attractive their guide was). But herein also lay a big problem: distance from the source material. With the exception of getting to the center of the Earth and how they leave it, there's not much Jules Verne left in here. For a beloved classic, that's a shame. But, again, the film will hopefully introduce a new set of readers to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1562549146">the novel</a>.<br /><br />It is also noteworthy to mention newcomer Anita Briem as the incredibly attractive guide Hannah. A stunning looker in terms of natural beauty, she not only prettied up the film but also gave a surprising rugged quality to her character. Also of note is veteran child star Josh Hutcherson as Sean. Many will recognize him from his roles in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M">Zathura</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6R5Y8">Bridge to Terabithia</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCFNZY">RV</a>, and the soon-to-be-released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316153788">Cirque Du Freak</a>. He played well next to Fraser and was the sympathetic character most will come to identify with.<br /><br />The final word...<br /><br />It's an okay diversion with lots of action and an update to Verne's classic, but it's not really Verne's anymore. Beware purists.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHAT THE ...?"></head><body><p>Visually striking and ominous, "From Hell" takes the Jack the Ripper theories, twists and turns them, and even takes tremendous liberty.  For instance, Prince Edward's character is totally against the historical facts, and I'm surprised the royal family didn't have a hissie fit!<br />But, that aside, what emerges is a taut, somewhat psychedelic look at the heinous crimes of one Jack the Ripper.<br />The direction is good, but at times, there was some difficulty in understanding a lot of the accents.  The art direction and set decoration, costuming, and music are brilliant.  What a horrible vision they painted of Londin the late nineteenth century.<br />I think Johnny Depp has done some really good work, including "Sleepy Hollow", but I found him a bit ineffective in this leading role.  His levels were forced, and he never really looked like he was truly in his role.<br />Heather Graham, in spite of her bad accent, still managed to offer a charming aspect to the life she had chosen.  I believed her most of the time, and was impressed with her performance.<br />Ian Holm, as always, was awesome.  This actor has done so much good work over the years, it's hard to see how he has not won an Oscar yet.  Remember him in "Alien"---wow!  Here, he portrays a retired doctor who offers help to Depp in understanding the Ripper's killings.<br />Robbie Coltrane, also a vastly underrated actor, steals the scenes from Depp.  He conveyed not only his masculine side, but also his sensitive side, particularly in his relationship with Depp.<br />However, to me, the true stars of this movie were the ladies who portrayed the hookers.  None of them were really "beautiful" or even "sexy."  They looked like a bunch of fishwives done up in tight dresses with bodices exhibiting much cleavage.  But these ladies convinced me of their sordid lives and how much they really didn't like it.  Hats off to Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch, Lesley Sharp, Estelle Kornik, Annabell Apsion, Joanna Page and Samantha Spiro.  They did fine work.  Also very good was Jason Flemyng in the role of the cab driver, Netley.<br />Overall, a good flick with much to recommend it.<br />RECOMMEND.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't have to be a Che-head"></head><body><p>Gael Garcia Bernal offers a riveting performance as the young Ernesto Guevara de la Serna in Walter Salles' film of The Motorcycle Diaries, based on book by both participants: Guevara's Notes on a Latin American Journey and Alberto Granado's Traveling with Che.<br /><br />Guevara and Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) are two Argentinian medical students who decide to trek across South America on a twenty-year-old motorcycle, hoping to arrive in Venezuela in time for Granado's thirtieth birthday.<br /><br />The trip matures them in many ways, bringing out their true natures, especially once they arrive at their destination, a leprosy clinic (Guevara's specialty). There the sick are separated from the caregivers by a river, even though lepers in treatment are not contagious.<br /><br />A lot of The Motorcycle Diaries feels contrived (especially the melodramatic climax) to paint a saintly portrait of the future revolutionary and guerilla (who would become known by the regional nickname "Che"), giving him few flaws aside from a typically human libido. Although, only de la Serna is allowed to take that to its full lustiness, leaving Bernal to play "romantic."<br /><br />But it is effective storytelling nonetheless, mostly due to the genuine performances by Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna, a actual relative of Guevara, but Eric Gautier's cinematography also makes good use of the locations to offer a sense of time and place.<br /><br />Fans of the political side of Guevara will appreciate a few allusions to his future, but you don't have to be a supporter to enjoy the "buddy movie" aspects of The Motorcycle Diaries, and the "coming of age" of a couple of young men, on its own terms.</p></body></html>

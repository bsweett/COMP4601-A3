Although, I must point out that the acting was not the only thing this film had going for it.  The plot was spot on, the dialog was tight and Fuqua did such a kick@$$ job directing...he deserved an oscar nod there!  The film follows Alonzo Harris (Washington) as he trains rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke in his BEST performance ever).  The problem is that Alonzo's methods, while effective in their own ways, are not ethical to say the least, and throughout the 24 hour period Jake is subjected to too much, way too much.  One may start to question Alonzo's motives, and rightfully so.  As the film starts to boil down we see Alonzo's true charactor, his inner demons.  This is by far Washingtons best performance, a true gritty and real performance that left me jaw dropped...although he lacked the perfection that Crowe brought to the table with 'A Beautiful Mind'...alas...There are two scenes that prove Washington deserved his nod...his opening scene in the dinner was the best intro of any charactor in so long, it was spot on perfection.  And the scene in the car where he puts the gun to Jake's head and forces him to smoke the weed...he embodies his charactor, mind body and soul.  This is one of the most origional pieces of hollywood history I've ever scene and is well worth the 2 hours spent in front of the screen, thanks to a tightly woven plot, breathtaking direction, perfect dialog and yes, Washington!</p></body></html>

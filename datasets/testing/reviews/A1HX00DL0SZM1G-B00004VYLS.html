<meta name="summary" content="Burton's "Batman" a revelation in high definition"></head><body><p>I'll be the first to admit that Tim Burton's original "Batman" has never been my cup of tea. Even before Christian Bale emerged on the scene in the excellent "Batman Begins" I just never quite thrilled with the 1989 picture. For me, despite an excellent performance, the problem lay with Jack Nicholson's villain who was more comical clown that a truly sinister enemy of the people of Gotham. Burton's style also seemed conflicted over precisely what he was hoping to accomplish seemingly stuck between a cheesy 1980s action comedy and a dark and brooding social commentary.<br /><br />Still, for all its faults "Batman" is a seminal film of American cinema, for it ushered in a genre that had only seriously been tapped by the Superman franchise at that time - the Superhero movie. Modern audiences no doubt do not recall a time when the Superhero movie was a relative oddity. Today's summer blockbusters are swamped with them. Burton's movie then deserves our respect.<br /><br />I will not relate the plot here for I dare say most are familiar with it. But rather examine the 2-disc Blu-ray Digibook release. It is safe to say with the release of this high definition Blu-ray release that you can start using those low definition DVDs as coffee coasters, because once you have been wowed by these Blu-rays you will never want to suffer through subpar DVD transfers ever again.<br /><br />The video quality is a revelation, with a rich and colorful palette, more detail and a depth that has never been apparent on any previous release. The audio is also nicely done and far superior to anything DVD has ever provided.<br /><br />I would advise all fans of the movie to pick up the Digibook release. Housed in a book containing 50 pages of photographs, script excerpts, and comic art this Blu-ray release contains a bumper list of special features a 72 minute documentary, an enthusiastic Tim Burton commentary, and (most interesting for me) a 41 minute exploration of the history of Batman. The special features are: Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman (SD, 41 minutes); Shadows of the Bat (SD, 72 minutes); Beyond Batman (SD, 51 minutes); The Heroes and the Villains (SD, 20 minutes); Storyboard Sequence (SD, 4 minutes); On the Set with Bob Kane (SD, 3 minutes); Music Videos (SD, 14 minutes); Theatrical Trailer (SD 2 minutes) and the aforementioned Burton commentary.<br /><br />With the significant improvement in quality and the housing of the discs in an attractive Digibook, only a fool or the technology challenged would ever settle for the DVD release. This Blu-ray release is definitely the way to go.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Prestige"></head><body><p>In 2006, so many duplicate movies came out. Two war movies, two film-noir movies, a virtual remake of a 2005 biopic, and two magician movies. The first was "The Illusionist" a great looking film, with some good stars and a hypnotic lead played by Edward Norton. It also had an actress, Jessica Biel, who isn't respected by many as an actress but ended up delivering a great performance. "The Prestige" also looks great, has a talent-laden cast, a very talented director,<br /><br />great set design and special effects, and an actress named Scarlett Johansson, who gives a very good performance despite being dissed every time she shows up in a movie. Also, both films have twist endings that a lot of people say are implausible but are never bothered me. "The Prestige" is directed by Christopher Nolan, the talented director behind Memento, Batman Begins, and Insomnia. It's co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, who wrote the story that inspired Christopher's script for "Memento." The movie stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Johansson, Andy Serkis, and David Bowie, all of whom are talented and underrated actors with the exception of Caine (who is very talented and not underrated at all). Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. As the film opens, Angier is performing a very dangerous trick. Borden, hiding incognito in the audience, manages to sneak backstage and watches as Angier falls through a trap door into a tank filled with water and drowns. Borden is accused of putting the tank there and is convicted of Angier's murder. As Borden sits in jail awaiting his hanging, he begins reading Angier's diary. Angier and Borden had begun as friends and partners in a magic show. Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) was also in the show as the girl who has her wrists tied is dipped into a tank of water as a curtain falls over it. When the curtain is removed, the girl is free. Problem is, Borden ties a faulty knot which results in her death. Now Angier and Borden are bitter enemies, who will stop at nothing to learn each other's secrets and top each other in everything. Then one night Angier catches one of Borden's shows and sees the greatest trick he has ever seen. Desperate to find out the secret, Angier sends his assistant (Johansson) to spy on him. And later, he seeks the help of a scientist (Bowie) to help him design a similar trick that will top Borden's. Caine plays mentors and friends both the men. Both Jackman and Bale are so great in their performances and are really fascinating to watch. Caine, Bowie, and Serkis (as Bowie's assistant) turn in great supporting performances. Johansson and Perabo aren't really considered fine actresses, but both are really good here. Although if I had a nickel for every time I've heard someone criticize Johansson's English accent, I'd be a rich man. A lot of people also criticize the ending, many say it's implausible. Not implausible, just not very likely. But this is a fictional film that frequently reminds you to pay attention. Watching the movie the 2nd time, it makes a lot more sense. "The Prestige" is one of the best films of 2006 in the sense that it's one of the best-produced films of the year. It's incredibly entertaining, great to look at, and is more likely to appeal to a broader audience than the typical "best film of the year" selection. I'm not sure how many people will like it as much as me, but I'm sure, at least, that you won't regret watching it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

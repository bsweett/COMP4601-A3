<meta name="summary" content="blu ray - criterion style"></head><body><p>I have seen some other blu ray editions of older black and white movies and they are all pretty good. This one is also pretty good, however the print as pointed out before is grainy. In fact I would say that hd does bring out the grain in any movie that were shot that way. This movie was cleaned up though from it's damaged shape that existed before,  and is the same print that you'd get on the standard edition , this one is clearer than the standard edition and if it were still in print I would still say that you are better off with this blu ray edition than the standard dvd one.  However, I would not spend 58.00 to get this one because people are selling it as a rare item now.  It's not worth the extra money over a standard version because of this.  It was worth it at 20.00 or so used over a standard priced dvd; however now that it's out of print I would say hold off unless you must have this as a blu ray edition in your collection. The film itself is one of the cinemas most influential movies and is a true classic. That being said avoid the blu ray version unless it comes back into print because the clarity is better but the grain of this movie really comes out on this version. I didn't mind it because I didn't pay some seller a overprice on it.  I have read that other criterion blu rays are less grainy so it's this print that was shot that way probably.  However if you can get a cheaper copy of this one on blu ray then grab it.  This edition has the same bonus features including the alterante opening, several radio shows featuring Orson Welles and the Harry Lime character. And other features, It also gives a good impression of how shattered austria was after the world war but at least Austria had the soviets leave it and the whole country was allowed to become a democratic nation.  The underrated Joseph Cotton also shines in this movie and it's one of his best performances.  This movie is a masterpiece well worth owning in your collection but you can't expect the type of blu ray clarity that a modern movie has. However I do agree that grain should be removed from older movies if possible. But it is a better looking print than any that have been around for a long time.</p></body></html>

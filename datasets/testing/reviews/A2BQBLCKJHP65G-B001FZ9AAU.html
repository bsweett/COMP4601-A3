<meta name="summary" content="Wow, He Really IS Iron Man!"></head><body><p>Marvel Comics, like it's counterpart nemesis DC, has had it's share of hits and misses when it comes to translating it's superhero catalog to the big screen. While successes like Spider-Man and XMen tore it's way to the top with ease, there's also the ones that got clobbered like The Punisher and the first attempt at Hulk in 2003. But with CGI technology reaching closer heights than ever before, now Hollywood has the ability to truly turn those ink and color panels to life, and no opportunity has been better received than with Iron Man.<br /><br />Tony Stark is basically a war profiteer that he and his company Stark Industries creates and manufacturers weapons so the good ole USA can win in a variety of battles, and in these reflective times, the battle currently is in the Middle East. When he himself is captured during a weapons demonstration that leaves numerous deadly pieces of shrapnel permanently close to his heart, he and a fellow scientific prisoner implant a device in his chest to keep them from reaching that area & in return becomes a major power source. When the captors want Stark to create an ultimate bomb, Stark turns the tables and creates a bodysuit of armor to escape and in return he realizes that he cannot go on in building weapons that usually just falls in the wrong hands, and unknowingly to Stark, by his business partner whose only concern is the almighty dollar and Tony's demise. So with his new and improved version of the suit that helped his escape, he's gonna beat them at their own game and find his superhero within.<br /><br />Let's state one thing:this is a GREAT cast. Robert Downey Jr not only looks the part of Tony Stark, but with his natural ego-driven comicial flair, he was born to play this role. Even the supporting cast of Jeff Bridges (who with his shaven head & beard might be hard to recognize), Terrence Howard, and a surprisingly Gwyneth Paltrow, who you'd figure would do a role like this in the early stages of her career not the opposite, bring the story along with a great pace. There's really not a weak link in the bunch. As for the CGI effects, of which most times I personally dread, they come off very natural and believable here. Where as in 2008's The Incredible Hulk when the lead character was of organic origin, Iron Man is pure solid-looking steel and because of that fact can be replicated much better without any doubt if the object is really on the screen or not. Visually all parties pulled off an amazing feat with Iron Man and honestly without flesh and blood to get in the way, the CGI does what at this point it can truly do best.<br /><br />Even though this review is for the single-disc edition, Paramount still gives you quite a value here than just a typical bare-bones disc. With a film presentation that has one of the best looking and sounding standard definition combos I've ever seen, they also include on it over twenty-four minutes of extended & deleted scenes which at least half of are worthy of a director's cut. There's even an Easter Egg hidden here maybe giving you a preview of what extras the 2 discer might have in store for you. So for fans on a limited income, or those that just want the movie, you won't go wrong by buying the smaller content version. While a commentary by Downey would have been nice (neither version has one), there still is plenty to enjoy with this presentation.<br /><br />Overall this was a great origin superhero film that didn't drag one bit within it's 2 hours and 2 minutes. Great cast, great story, and a bonus ending scene (featuring a surprising cameo) that will make you demand more in the near future. And unlike The Dark Knight, that took itself way too seriously, Iron Man still mentions problematic issues concerning war today and thrilling us all along the way.<br /><br />P.S.: The two-disc version has extensive behind the scenes and interviews with the film's cast and crew that in my opinion could have brought my rating a good half point or more if that was the version I chose to see as of this writing.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)</p></body></html>

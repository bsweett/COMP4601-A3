<meta name="summary" content="A surrealistic over the top bad cop thriller"></head><body><p>I'm sure that many fans were shocked when Denzil Washington did an about face from his good guy roles by playing Alonzo Harris, the bad cop to end all bad cops.  He richly deserved the Oscar and I believe that the intensity of his performance also uplifted Ethan Hawke's performance since he received his first Oscar nomination.  Before this film I was indifferent to Hawke, believeing him to be a competent but stiff actor but this film and the remake of "Assaust On Precinct 13" has changed my opinion of him as an actor. The "bad cop movie" is nothing new having its roots in the fifties with films like "Rogue Cop", "Pushover" and "Shield for Murder" as prime examples of this genre but this film pushes it to a higher level.  And also the timing of this film helped at the box-office since the Ramparts scandal of the LAPD was in progress when this film was released.  If you're a fan of this genre or a fan of great acting, this flick is recommended.  It's also still available at a premium price in HD DVD (fantastic transfer!!) versus the $18 or $20 you'll have to pay for in Blu-Ray.</p></body></html>

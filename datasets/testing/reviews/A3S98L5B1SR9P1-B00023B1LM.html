<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Identity"></head><body><p>The Bourne Identity is a great spy thriller. Keeps you guessing & on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon is perfect as Jason Bourne. Damon pulls off a character that is smart but lost, composed but confused, lethal but child like. From the minute the fishermen fished him out of the Mediteranian Sea & finds out he can't recall who he is. Then finding out thru a capsule implanted in his body...only a bank account in Zurich. Once Bourne gets to the Bank of Zurich all hell breaks loose. Franka Potente as Maria, the German gypsie, is very good. This movie is an excellent action spy thriller that I would recomend to all to see.</p></body></html>

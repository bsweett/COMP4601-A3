<meta name="summary" content="Sequel relies too much upon coincidence"></head><body><p>If the first film took its theme to be the collective inheritance of a militaristic and violent culture, this film is about the effects upon a family of personal guilt.  But the theme is pounded in a bit too strongly by a series of coincidences and implausible developments, especially when one of the zombies (I mean "infected") develops a personal vendetta and somehow seems to already be waiting for the main characters everywhere they happen to decide to go.<br /><br />Part of the appeal of the first film was that once the sci-fi/horror premise was established events unfolded very realistically and unpredictably.  In this film events seem clearly designed to fulfill a symbolic role in the working out of one man's attempt to run from the past, and of the effects of this evasion upon his family.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film seemed intriguing to begin with, and the opening scene was quite strong: in an act of cowardice and self-preservation a man abandons his wife to the advancing hordes of infected; this situation raises interesting questions and sets up an intriguing conflict at the heart of the film: now that he has survived how can he live with himself, and how can he face his children, who will not understand the fear that led him to such a dreadful decision?  28 Weeks Later everything looks to be under control and the survivors in London are being "protected" by American soldiers, against the possibility that the virus might still exist -- but of course it does or we wouldn't have a movie.<br /><br />Apart from the story I also found the execution of this film to be lacking.  It is obviously a bigger film than the first, with a bigger budget -- spent mostly on military action and explosions and a bigger vision of an empty and desolate London -- but this one lacks the inventiveness of the first film.  What was fresh in 28 Days Later feels gimmicky here -- okay, the zombies  can run, but does that mean that they must always be running?  Can't they ever slow down and give us time to look at the action?  The video documentary style footage here also seems just like a less effective duplicate of the style of the first one, and not so much an exciting new look -- and the frenetic editing of the zombie attacks and killings doesn't feel inventive but overdone and done to death.  It sounds odd, but after several bouts of kinetic mayhem with sprinting dead I began to find it quite boring and repetitive -- and that definitely wasn't my experience with the first film, where I was on the edge of my seat the entire time (both in the theater and when I brought it home on dvd).  The first film I would recommend to anyone who likes film (and doesn't mind a bit of blood and gore and zombie violence).  This film I would only recommend for fans of horror and zombie flicks.</p></body></html>

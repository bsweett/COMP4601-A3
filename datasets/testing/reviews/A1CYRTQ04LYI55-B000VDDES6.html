<meta name="summary" content="For Farrell fanatics only"></head><body><p>Will Farrell plays a sexist 70s news anchorman.  Christina Applegate his competition.  Sounds funny.  Has some laughs.  But it's really not one of his best.  Only worth watching if you've already seen Old School, Talladega Nights, or pretty much any of the rest of his movies.  He's done so much better elsewhere.</p></body></html>

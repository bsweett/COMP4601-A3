<meta name="summary" content="more action than #1 but story not as good"></head><body><p>Although on one of the extras the producer tells us there is more story in this one, I felt it was more action. Nothing wrong with that but there is no mystery. In the first one we went through almost 2/3rds of the flick to finally find out why the woman was being "transported."<br /><br />This one is pretty much a straightforward kidnap/chase movie with the usual shoot-'em-ups. Not that there is anything wrong with that but #1 is far superior as far as plot goes.<br /><br />Jason Statham, though, has better more classic fight scenes (you know, armed men 6 to 10 vs. 1) that show he is now a cross between Gene Kelly and Jackie Chan in his fight moves combined with use of props.<br /><br />The female assassin is classic from the concept of "yeah, let's have her shoot off her machine guns while wearing a bikini" to the way she fights in her final scene we have certainly never seen metallic beaded drapes ever used in such a creative way.<br /><br />All in all great fun all around with enough stoicism under fire from Statham to make it all seem like Transporter, you never disappoint us.</p></body></html>

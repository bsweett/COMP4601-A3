Personally, I love this movie, its one of my top two favorites in the whole Friday the 13th series,, so there's no way I would rate this movie this low. This review is simply based on the 3-D aspect of the film, which I must say..is pretty disappointing. First off, the generic Red & Blue 3-D glasses always give me headaches when I watch 3-D movies with them, but if the effects are good, its usually well worth it. Unfortunately, I was pretty much just left with the headache after viewing this one. The only thing that kept it interesting was the fact that the movie is great, and I just stayed focused on watching it, and for the most part, had to ignore the 3-D! In a nutshell..they're just wasn't much "3-D" in this 3-D movie. Most of the gimmicks just didn't work..I kept just seeing double a lot on the screen, rather than images actually standing out. They were a couple of kinda cool moments here and there (Harold putting the stick back on the clothesline, the yo yo gimmick was alright, and the pitchfork through the throat of Fox), but other than that, the 3-D was just more of an annoyance rather than a bonus. Also, I was really disappointed that there were no other special features on the DVD. I recently repurchased the Deluxe Editions of Parts 1 and 2 simply because of the special features (and a pretty cool sliding case!), but I was surprised that there wasn't any added features to this one, except the 3-D feature. This just clearly shows another attempt at the movie companies to sucker fans into buying the film yet again. And I guess its working, cause I bought it! The non 3-D version of the film is also included, so you don't need to glasses to watch the movie, and if you don't own this movie, then this is a decent buy..at least you'll have the "deluxe" 3-D version, but unless you're a die hard horror fan like myself, there no real reason to buy this if you already have it. Believe me, the 3-D just isn't worth it! I'm giving this 2 stars simply because of my love for this film, the fact that the non 3-D version of the film is on the disc, and the sliding case is kinda cool! But shame on Paramount for not adding anything else new to the film, and yet calling it a "Deluxe Edition"..one special feature (and a poorly executed one, at that) doesn't make it deluxe by any means.</p></body></html>

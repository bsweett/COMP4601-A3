Mr. Incredible has to endure the boredom of a job as an insurance claims specialist while his wife and children cooperate by also concealing their extraordinary powers in front of others. This is hardest on the children as they play with youngsters at school and on the athletic field. Eventually, Mr. Incredible is lured out of retirement on a ruse by a former foe. By now Mr. Incredible is older and fatter but he still proves equal to the challenge. The rest of the movie is filled with excitement and comical moments as Mr. Incredible finds himself in a tight spot from which only his family can rescue him. The cast is headed by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter.

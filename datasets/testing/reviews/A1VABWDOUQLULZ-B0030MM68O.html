That aside, the film sold itself on stress, which I'm sure I can't imagine what wartime is really like, but I do know it takes more than stress to convey a compelling story.  While the technical aspects and direction of the film were impressive, the acting wasn't anything to write home about.  It's clear that this film got a lot of attention due to its timeliness and controversy.  It's not because it was that great.</p></body></html>

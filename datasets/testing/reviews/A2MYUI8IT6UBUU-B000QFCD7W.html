<meta name="summary" content="Wild Hogs Movie Review"></head><body><p>What started as a gay-joke laced Tim Allen comedy quickly turned into a disastrous problem-laden situation comedy which fell into the age old trap of seriousness. When the conflict is too colossal, the only solution is nonsense. A variegated cast and an unrealistically neat and tidy conclusion make this wannabe feel-good movie second-class salvage.<br /><br />Four middle-aged friends (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy) reach a midlife crisis in which they are bored with their everyday routines and threadbare family activities. Having a tradition of going to the local bar, riding motorcycles and wearing black leather adorned with a fictitious "Wild Hogs" gang logo, the lot decide to go on a road trip. Taking in the sights and the fresh air, they encounter a licentious policeman, a barbarous "real" biker gang and an abundance of adventure in the peaceful chile-loving town of Madrid, New Mexico.<br /><br />While most of the diverse cast manages to play it relatively inconspicuous, Martin Lawrence feels out of place. Travolta is in more and more comedies of late, probably since he's getting older and out of shape and less believable as a dramatic actor. Allen plays his typical "Tool Man" role, and William H. Macy goes back to his Mystery Men roots; which are withered and dying. Lawrence looks a little too young and his brand of comedy is mainly obnoxious dialogue, whereas the other three more easily fall into their roles of middle-aged, worn out men.<br /><br />The story essentially wishes to be a comedy, but the plotline resembles more serious fare. The film falls into a classic plot deterioration complex, in which the conflict created for the protagonists to overcome is so incredibly serious that the only solution is one of nonsensical luck or unbelievable circumstances. The mood is supposed to be carefree and silly, but the loss of all believability turns the lighthearted comedy into absurdity. The screenwriters couldn't figure out how to solve the enormous dilemma and it doesn't fool anyone. The most popular and pathetic "easy way out" example is the "it was all just a bad dream" scenario, which we've all seen before and is thankfully not employed by Wild Hogs. After such a noticeable blunder is made, the film wraps up too neatly. When every solution is presented to the audience with a cherry on top, it adds to the disbelief. Not everyone has to end up happy for a comedy to be commercially or critically successful.<br /><br />Another aspect that doesn't coalesce into the film smoothly is the overly intense villains, which could have been in a serious drama. Ray Liotta plays the rival biker gang's leader in such an unpleasant and sinister role that it feels contradictory to the playful design of the rest of the film. Towards the middle of the movie, viewers will probably be shrinking in fear for the hero foursome, due to the asperity of the dastardly enemies. The only imaginable conclusion for Liotta's character is that he will resort to murder in compensation for the wrongs done to him. When that isn't feasible in a film engineered like this, all other solutions only disrupt the suspension of disbelief. Including how many heavy-handed punches can be taken by the Wild Hogs without incurring any injuries.<br /><br />Lots of interesting cameos and bit parts are thrown into the film, which definitely helps, but not sufficiently. Legendary "Easy Rider" biker Peter Fonda makes an appearance, as well as Loveline guru Dr. Drew. Marisa "still sexy" Tomei plays the love interest and several other noticeable character actors appear throughout.<br /><br />Fun at times, silly at others and absolutely ridiculous most of the time, Wild Hogs is the perfect comedy for fans of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy, and probably no one else.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></body></html>

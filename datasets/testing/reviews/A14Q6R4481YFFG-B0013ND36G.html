<meta name="summary" content="Worthy sequel"></head><body><p>Another reviewer felt that the premises of T1 and T2 had been betrayed, because T3 posits that we cannot change our futures.  I agree that it does create a contradiction (if the future is predetermined, how come Judgment Day was delayed by six years?) that would need Larry Fishbourne-style philosophical psychobabble to explain.<br /><br />That said, the film does get many things right.  The directing is top-notch, and casting is great.  I never liked Edward Furlong too much in T2, and it was a relief to see that the new guy was up to the job.  The love interest was good, with the appropriate mix of humanity and steel.  The T-X was outstanding, both the actress and the concept, although she broke little new ground.  The ending was not your usual saccharine Hollywood finish, which was also appreciated.</p></body></html>

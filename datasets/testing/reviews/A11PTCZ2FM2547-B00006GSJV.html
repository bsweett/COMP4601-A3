<meta name="summary" content="The Power of the Mind"></head><body><p>This moving, very stirring film required several viewings on my part.  First of all, I had to get over the disappointment that A BEAUTIFUL MIND beat out &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; as the Best Picture of 2001--a disappointment that created an inherent bias in my not-so-beautiful mind.  Second, all of the Hollywood embellishments in this film had to be dismissed as inconsequential to the overall magnitude of the story--a story about a very real man with a very real illness.<p>And it is here--the story--that A BEAUTIFUL MIND excels.  The human mind is a complex, often unforgiving organ that tends to confuse its owner over what is real, and what is an illusion.  And thus the distinction between reality and illusion becomes blurred, a disturbing development that leads to complete dysfunction.  Princeton mathematician John Nash succumbed to the power of his mind to distort reality; the resulting battle to conquer his demons--aided by the unwavering support of a loving wife--is a compelling, wonderful story.<p>Russell Crowe delivers a riveting performance, but needs to work on his West Virgina accent.  Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and Ed Harris are sensational.  I'm still a little miffed that this film won Best Picture, but darn glad A BEAUTIFUL MIND is in my video collection.<br />--D.

I'm a New Yorker."></head><body><p>I live just a little over a mile from where the World Trade Center used to be, and I'll never forget that day five years ago, when the world watched its destruction.  There's finally some new construction going on in the area now and I could actually see it from the window of the theater where I chose to view this film.  It was a welcome contrast to the horror depicted on the screen, and the horror all of us lived with daily during that time.  I consider myself lucky that none of my loved ones were in those buildings that day.  Other fellow New Yorkers were not as fortunate.<br /><br />Of course I knew the plot of this Oliver Stone film.  I knew that the two Port Authority police officers who were trapped in the rubble were eventually rescued.  Later, we were reminded that only 20 people were rescued alive from the rubble.  I should have remembered that because I, like many others, volunteered to give blood.  We were all turned away though.  There were not enough survivors who could use it.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena are cast as the two cops.  Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal are their wives.  The acting was excellent and they all must have had a great dialogue coach because their New York accents sounded authentic.  During much of the film, we feel the claustrophobia of being trapped along with the men.  They are pinned under debris, terribly hurt, and yet they keep themselves alive by talking to each other.  There are also some flashbacks about their families as well as a current running timeline as their families learn of the disaster and wait for news.  The film captures the time and the place perfectly.  I was a bit unprepared by my own emotional reaction to the film though; I found myself weeping during much of it, not only for the two men trapped inside the buildings, but weeping for the disappointment of the last five years.  Even though life here has returned to normal, our world has become a much more dangerous place.<br /><br />After viewing film I walked around the area.  It's bustling and beautiful.  The World Financial Center has been restored to its former splendor and the riverfront is full of joggers and bicyclists.  There's a trapeze school and a batting range and attractive landscaping throughout the area.  And there's new construction which promises even more attractive piers and walkways.  Whenever I'm down in that area though, the one thing that always dominates my consciousness is the Statue of Liberty off in the distance.  It's still there.</p></body></html>

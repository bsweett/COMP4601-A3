<meta name="summary" content="Steve Martin is hilarious in this weak remake"></head><body><p>Steve Martin (The Jerk, Roxanne) fills the shoes of Inspector Jacques Clouseau who is put on the case of the missing Pink Panther diamond which was stolen from a murdered coach named Yves Gluant, played by an uncredited Jason Statham (The Transporter 1 & 2, Snatch),  by Chief Inspector Dreyfus played by Kevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda, In & Out) who wants him to fail the case. Clouseau gets a partner Gendarme Gilbert Ponton played by the awesome Jean Reno (The Professional, The Da Vinci Code) who accompanies Clouseau on his case. Pretty weak remake only has the hilarious & funny performance by Steve Martin who makes his role his own which is great with some funny moments and nice support from Jean Reno. Beyonce Knowles (Austin Powers 3, Fighting Temptations) is miscast in her role as Xania and it's so is Kevin Kline which is a bit of a disappointment. Martin trying to say Hamburger in that accent was hilarious as was the scene where he eats one. There's an awesome uncredited cameo by Clive Owen (Sin City, Closer) who plays Nigel Boswell/Agent 006. Also starring the lovely Emily Mortimer (Formula 51, Scream 3), Henry Czerny (Mission: Impossible, Cement), Kristin Chenoweth (RV, Bewitched) and Roger Rees (Game 6, Robin Hood: Men In Tights). It was a kick to also see Jean Reno dance. It was weird but memorable. Too bad for this one is all I have to say.</p></body></html>

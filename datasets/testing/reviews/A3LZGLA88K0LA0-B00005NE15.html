<meta name="summary" content="A FOGGY DAY..."></head><body><p>How do you follow up the immensely popular and genre-shifting classic HALLOWEEN?  Carpenter could've rushed HALLOWEEN II, but wisely chose THE FOG as his follow-up.  Given a much bigger budget than its predecessor, Carpenter gives us some gorgeous scenery, scary scary fog, a haunting score, and a dilly of a ghost story.  Adrienne Barbeau has a great voice for an easy listening radio program, and her performance is admirable considering most of it is solo.  Jamie Lee seems happy to lose the virginal Laurie and play the floozie-ish role.  Janet Leigh, Jamie's famous Psycho mommy, is over the hill in her role as the town's &quot;unofficial&quot; mayor, and offers solid support.  Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers return from &quot;Halloween&quot; also and Loomis is fun, Cyphers again proves he's only a presence, little more, but he's not in it too long anyway.  John Houseman is the perfect ghost story teller; Hal Holbrook, like Leigh, dives into his role with that great actor on vacation role, and the ending will knock your head off!!!!<br />THE FOG is not destined to be the classic HALLOWEEN has become, but it is a frightening film and proved young Carpenter and Debra Hill (his co-writer and producer) knew what they were doing.  Unfortunately, the only other real winner for Carpenter is his remake of THE THING.  His last movie, GHOST OF MARS, is an atrocity.<br />But sit back and enjoy this with the lights off.  You'll never like sea chanties again!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best of the series - possibly"></head><body><p>I'd avoided watching Spider Man in the theatres because everyone told me it was too long, etc.  As a long time Marvel fan - I enjoyed this a lot.  I think this one hit the spot.  Sam Raimi has made a love story cum heroic epic.  The effects are spectacular (topping the previous two shows) and really reflect the comic book world that Spider Man comes from.  The Sandman is pure Steve Ditko, and Venom's effects are brilliantly executed.  Acting wise, Tobey Maguire and Mary Jane are the same - but this time Peter Parker has to deal with a Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde persona and a coterie of supervillains - just like the original comic.  Let's hope there's a sequel...</p></body></html>

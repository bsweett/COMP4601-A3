<meta name="summary" content="THE URGE TO MERGE..."></head><body><p>This is a fascinating and visually stunning documentary, narrated by the mellifluent Morgan Freeman. In it, the filmmakers capture the yearly march of the Emperor Penguins to their breeding grounds, an arduous seventy mile trek inland from the sea from which the penguins emerge. Single file, the hundreds of penguins march onward, knowing that some of them may fall by the wayside. Still, they march on.<br /><br />When the penguins get to their destination, the mating ritual begins. All this takes place in Antarctica, one of the most inhospitable regions on earth. Despite driving blizzards, extreme temperatures, lack of food, and other hardships, the Emperor Penguins let nothing deter them from their set course and the propagation of their species.<br /><br />With its spectacular cinematography, this is a fantastic, must see film for all those who love documentaries and nature films. Bravo!</p></body></html>

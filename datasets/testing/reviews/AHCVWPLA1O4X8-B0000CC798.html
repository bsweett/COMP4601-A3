<meta name="summary" content="A spectacular follow-up to the first film"></head><body><p>In this, the second installment of the X-men series, the mutants find themselves up against something far more subtle and difficult to defeat than the first time:  humans who can manipulate them.  This movie was a tremendous follow-up to the first film, and (for me at least) surpassed it in nearly all aspects.  First of all, the characters from the first film are very nicely developed, especially those of Wolverine and Rogue.  Second, many mutants with small parts in the first one and even more who never made appearances at all are now part of the team, and get in on the action.  And finally, the action sequences, special effects, and storyline are absolutely amazing!<p>Nightcrawler, Colossus, Iceman--these are all familiar X-men to many, yet they had no role (or insignificant in Iceman's case) in the first film.  It was great to see the action with these and other new mutants.  Also, Wolverine's past is more fully explored, and the relationship between Magneto and Xavier is also developed (the fact that they have to work together, to some extent, to defeat a common enemy shows that they really are two men with the same purpose, but a different way of accomplishing their goals).  I was very impressed with the twists and turns taken in the relationships of the characters, and the development of the X-man saga.<p>The special effects for this film were absolutely breathtaking, as were the action sequences.  The film opens with a spectacular display by Nightcrawler, and is soon followed up by a berserker rage by Wolverine.  There are several great sequences in the film, and the sight of each mutant using his or her powers (Magneto breaking out of his cell comes to mind) makes you want to stand up and cheer.<p>With the colossal success of these movies and the Spider-Man film, Marvel movies seem to be riding high.  I would love to see a movie involving both Spidey and the X-men, but that's not likely to happen any time soon.  Still, for what it's worth, X2: X-men United is a wonderful new addition to the growing catalog of comic-book movies.</p></body></html>

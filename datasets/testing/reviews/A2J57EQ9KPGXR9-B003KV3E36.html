<meta name="summary" content="Stuff blows up REAL good..."></head><body><p>Not bad.. That was my reaction after watching the 4th installment of Rambo. This time round, Rambo has to rescue a bunch of dummies held captive by Burmese soldiers - in the most violent manner possible. WARNING: The last 15 minutes of the film is not recommended for the squeamish. Heads and torsos explode in a hail of .50 cal gunfire. No punches are pulled. In one scene, an entire village is decimated and the few survivors are forced to march through a mine field. "Happiness is a warm gun" indeed...<br /><br />Rambo's plot is just as politically charged as the previous three films. Maybe that is a good thing - people may actually want to learn more about the situation in Burma, maybe even write a letter to Congress about it. Who knows, stranger things have happened..<br /><br />All in all, the movie delivers what it promised. The "pacifists are stupid sissies" moral of the movie is dumb, but I was'nt expect anything complex from this movie.</p></body></html>

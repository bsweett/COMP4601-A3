<meta name="summary" content="ANOTHER GEM FROM PIXAR! GREAT 4 DISC BLU RAY RELEASE!"></head><body><p>Few Movie companies have as good a track record as Pixar. With better story lines than most Hollywood dramas, Pixar never fails to impress and most of the time astound! 'Up' is a beautiful looking film with a very emotional theme and is probably a little too adult for the younger kids. Pixar leaves out the wisecracking side characters and adds depth to the story of an old man who loses his life partner and must find a way to keep on going. He decides to complete one of the many adventures he and his wife had planned for so many years, but like many of us never seemed to get to it. Yes!, it does sound a little too deep for an animated film, but animated films have come along way and if this is the direction they're headed that's fine by me!<br /><br />The film has some of the most impressive animation ever done and the characters are, well.....almost real! Pixar hasn't really had a bad film and this is certainly among one of their best, but with winners such as Wall-E, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, I'm not sure if this slightly downer is going to become a film to watch over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film and deserves a heap of credit trying to follow Wall-E, but with such an emotionally adult theme, I'm not sure who this film is targeted for?<br /><br />The 4 disc Blu Ray is loaded with interesting extras and the usual standard DVD, digital copy blah, blah, blah, and is certainly one of the best Blu Ray releases I've seen so far. 'Up' is not always as "up" as it should be, but it is one of the most beautiful and poignant films I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

I enjoyed the movie better than I thought I would based on the critical panning it took. However, it didn't add much if anything to what I got from the book. I thought that the considerable talents of Audrey Tatou were largely wasted as Sophie. Tom Hanks was OK as Langdon. Ian McKellen was a hoot as Teabing. All-in-all, an earnest adaptation, but nothing special--many film versions of very popular books have turned out the same way, and some films have been quite a bit worse (Bonfire of the Vanities, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, for example), so I guess that DaVinci Code was handled pretty well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jackson's performance makes this film."></head><body><p>Changing Lanes is one of the more interestingly-premised psychological thriller-type films. (It definitely is more difficult to pinpoint this one...it manages to navigate through several different genres rather effectively)  While it borders on predictably formulated, Jackson's performance in this is, not surprisingly, terrific.<p>Two strangers find their lives intertwined unexpectedly after a car accident.  One is on his way up, and one is on his way out of the gutter, for lack of a better term.  Affleck, in a role seemed tailored for him, plays the young attorney on his way to power.  This role didn't seem like one of his greatest acting stretches, but it also wasn't mishandled.  He does manage to guide his characters zig zag-ing perceptions of right and wrong with the skill you would expect.<p>Jackson handles his part with much more of what you've come to expect.  He expertly handles his character's seeming disregard for all he has rebuilt in reaction to the sheer frustration and absurdity of his situation.  It's a much more complext part than is appears, and Jackson, again, is worth watching.<p>From a story perspective, it's not the tightest thriller you have ever seen, but it is an interesting twist on the typical cat-and-mouse game genre.</p></body></html>

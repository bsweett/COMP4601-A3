With the exception of Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" I can't remember a movie having such moving effect on me.<br /><br />The entire film seems to be shot with handheld cameras, and this gives it a documentary-type feel.  In fact, it is almost as if this entire thing was captured on video as it actually happened and put in the movie theaters.  I'm sure that is exactly how director Paul Greengrass wanted it to appear.<br /><br />When I first heard this movie was coming out, I had a mix of emotions.  I worried that the film would portray the terrorists as being successful Jihadists that had foiled all of America's best defenses.  That was not the case.  I worried that "United 93" would portray President Bush as a man who failed to lead at such an important time in America's history.  That was not the case - he wasn't even in the movie at all, unless I missed it when I had to leave the theater for a few seconds.<br /><br />"United 93" captures the emotional trauma, the desperate decisions, and the shockingly horrid events that took place on September 11, 2001.  The film is not your classical big Hollywood production.  There are no breathtakingly choreographed, large set scenes.  There is no famous Hollywood hunk in a lead role that you will remember for years to come.  No, this is a movie on fire with raw emotion.  It is a movie that takes you where you know evil seems to have won.  This film shows how brave men and women made sure that it didn't.<br /><br />I'm glad I made the choice to see this film.  It has made me think about how precious life is.  It has made me wonder how people can ever view innocent people as a target of revenge, no matter where they live, no matter how they live, and no matter what they think about my God and my faith.  This film is a tribute to freedom in that the passengers of "United 93" decided to fight on, knowing full well that they might die while doing so.<br /><br />The actors in "United 93" kept their performances on real-life mode, with no one actor stealing the show.  That made the film seem like a documentary (I know, I mentioned this above already).  The last few minutes of this movie are so intense that I actually started to dig my fingernails into the theater chair arms while I was watching.  It's that moving!<br /><br />The movie is also not as bloody or gory as I expected it to be.  I think kids 13 and older will be okay with this film.<br /><br />So that's my review; one of the most intense and amazing movies ever made.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Book And Best Movie Thus Far"></head><body><p>I must confess this was my favorite of the books and I am very impressed that the screenwriter and directer were able to get this opus into one movie, I had heard they had discussed breaking it into two movies, but the studio balked..good move.  This is the best of the movies, the actors, especially Radcliffe, really grow into their characters, and the film is paced very well.  Fiennes as Voldemort is perfect, I look forward to seeing more of him.  Though I like Gambon as an actor, I am not sold on him as Dumbledore, he just does not connect with the young actors like Harris did, you felt Harris' Dumbledore loved Harry, with Gambon you don't feel that, it's odd, they have no chemistry.  The special effects in this film are very well done, and I loved how the snake comes out of the title letters at the beginning, that was inspired.  The extra's are o.k., the outtakes are cool, but I expected more, but that's a minor quibble.  I highly recommend this DVD, it's the class of the series.</p></body></html>

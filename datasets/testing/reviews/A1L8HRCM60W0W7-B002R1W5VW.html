<meta name="summary" content="SWINDLER'S LIST: NOT UNPREDICTABLE, BUT WELL EXECUTED."></head><body><p>Nicholas Cage is finally back with a movie that is as much of a thriller as you've been exposed to in 2003 -- explosive bucaneers of the seas, clumsy terminators and desperate really, really "bad" boys -- and yet without all that somatic high-octane action. <p>As a mystery tale with delectable twists, the movie has a handful of surprises in store, some more convincing than others, although I had a nagging suspicion about the final big twist which did come true (somewhat of a gyp with a twister tale.) To mess it further, all of the pretty suave turns in the movie were thrown to the dogs in an absolutely feel-good denouement... <p>Other than that, this is a very watchable movie. The execution is brilliant, film students take note of the camerawork and the screenplay. Above all, Nick Cage is really the cornerstone of the movie's class, his potrayal of someone with a cleanliness (and darkness) OCD is the stuff that Oscars are handed out for. <p>Some of the negative reviews talk of the morally challenged script. Well, I never for a moment felt that Cage's or Rockwell's characters were oblivious of their follies. That they were depicted in a likeable manner does not mean that the script advocates or endorses their behavior. <p>This is no "Get Shorty" in style or story, but is quite a decent rental nonetheless. Recommended.</p></body></html>

Unlike those movies that were too campy, this movie is a lot more serious.<br /><br />Clark Kent has a real personality.  He is not the bungling nerd portrayed in those earlier films.  He actually has a bigger role in this movie than Superman.  Kate Bosworth is a much better Lois Lane than Margot Kidder and Kevin Spacey is perfect as a much more ruthless Lex Luthor.  This movie seems to revitalize the Superman series the same way as Batman Begins has done for Batman.<br /><br />In this one, Superman is caught up in a triangle with Lois, her son and her "fianc&eacute;e" whom her son refers to as "Dad."  The fianc&eacute;e happens to work at the Daily Planet and becomes fast friends with Clark.  Not to give anything away but besides Superman saving Lois and her fianc&eacute;e, Lois and the fianc&eacute;e have to save Superman.<br /><br />There is a real touching moment when Lois' son draws a picture of Superman holding onto the fianc&eacute;e, who is holding onto Lois and the son.  When Superman first left Earth, Lois was upset that he left without saying goodbye so she wrote an article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman," for which she wins the Pulitzer.  All during the movie she tries to distance herself from anything about Superman, preferring to cover a large blackout story instead.  Of course, by the end of the movie she will end up writing "Why the World Needs Superman."<br /><br />Nice cameo by Jack Larson as a bartender that shoots the breeze with the new Jimmy Olsen.  Frank Langella is also excellent as Perry White.<br /><br />Forget all the flaws and the negative reviews.  This one delivers!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="breaks the great rule"></head><body><p>The great rule of turning a comic book into a movie is this: Thou shalt not change the premise of the story.<br /><br />League of Extraordinary Gentlemen breaks the rule. All the creators of the movie had to do was stick to the source material. They could've had a blast of a movie but no they had to go and make changes....such as adding Tom Sawyer to the mix. This did nothing for the story at all. Mina, an English woman who survived Dracula is turned into Amazonesque woman with what sounds like a Swedish accent. Mina is also a full fledged day walking vampire in the movie. In the book she is not. In the book Mina and Quartermaine (played by the always sexy Sean Connery) are intensely attracted to one another despite their age difference.<br /><br />In the movie Mina is messing around with Dorian Gray who doesn't even appear in the book. The Invisible Man is wildly different from the character in both the comic book and the original novel. Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde are, at least, handled  mostly true to the comic book though the movie gives no indication about how Hyde feels about Mina. Captain Nemo, the real hero of the movie is the only character to make the jump from the book to the screen unscathed.<br /><br />I wanted to love this movie. I was certainly pumped up when I sat to down to watch it but the creators blew it. Consign this one to the What Might Have Been File.</p></body></html>

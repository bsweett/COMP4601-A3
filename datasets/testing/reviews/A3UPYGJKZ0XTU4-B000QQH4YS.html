<meta name="summary" content="A Leftist Shoot'em Up. Funny, Bloody, and Slyly Serious. But Who Would Have Thought?"></head><body><p>"RoboCop" has the distinction of being a leftist shoot'em-up, which might be why the film attained instant cult status when it hit theaters in 1987. It has lots of bloody action, cool-looking technology, and skewers the ideals of Reagan Republicans. Kind of like "Rambo" for liberals. Detroit, Michigan of the near future is overrun with crime, and the city has hired Omni Consumer Products (OCP), a private enterprise, to manage its police force. OCP's vice president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) has high hopes for a problematic ED-209 enforcement droid to augment the police force. But up-and-comer Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) has a better idea: A cyborg that incorporates the corpse of a deceased cop, retaining his instincts, increasing his firepower, and programming his directives. When Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is murdered on the job, he is transformed into RoboCop.<br /><br />"RoboCop" is one of those liberal movies that even conservatives admit they love. It's a violent, bring'em-to-justice action movie but also an anti-privatization tract. Elements within OCP are corrupt, working unscrupulously to create a need for their product in order to sell it. The company is at odds with the Detroit police force, which is threatening to strike. And RoboCop is just an enhanced version of a corporate drone, stripped of his own identity and programmed so that he may become "product". OCP is planning a huge industrial complex called Delta City that will provide 2 million much-needed jobs, but the script even manages to spin that unfavorably. One may or may not agree with its sentiments, but the sheer quantity of socio-political commentary that screenwriters Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner, and director Paul Verhoeven were able to pack into the film amazes me.<br /><br />Black comedy, gory action, and RoboCop's sympathetic nature make it all watchable. RoboCop's monotone statements remind me of a mechanized Dirty Harry. They evoke both sly laughter and vengeful approval. But RoboCop is victimized by forces he cannot control and that he struggles to understand. His simple mind is compelled to cope with dirty politics and unscrupulous profiteering. The audience sympathizes with that. Leeza Gibbons makes a semi-cameo as a newscaster whose reports allude to many hot political topics of the 1980s, as do fake commercials that interrupt the news. In fact, there are so many references to then-current events -nuclear arms race, toxic waste, SDI, the Jarvik heart, urban violence- that it feels like a trip back in time to my high school government class. "RoboCop" is simultaneously over-the-top and sly, and it's still fun.<br /><br />The DVD (MGM/Orion 2001): I'm reviewing a bare bones edition of the film, whose only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (1 1/2 min). Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish and French. If you would like an audio commentary and the longer, more graphically violent "director's cut" of the film, you will need the out-of-print Criterion Collection disc (1998).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Starsky & Hutch" is a brilliantly funny movie!"></head><body><p>"Starsky & Hutch" is one of the most brilliantly funny movies in recent history, besides "50 First Dates". Ben Stiller is Starsky and Owen Wilson is Hutch, our main characters, who are forced to partner up with each other by their captain. Their first case is going after a drug dealer, Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn. Snoop Dogg is Huggy Bear, their street informant, helps them on the case. The performances by the cast, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Snoop Dogg, are extremely funny and well acted. The story is brilliant and is as funny as Stiller, Wilson, Dogg are. The directing by Todd Phillips is brilliant. The story by Stevie Long and John O' Brien, as is the screenplay by John O' Brien, Todd Phillips, and Scot Armstrong. The music by Theodore Shapiro is excellent. The cinematography by Barry Peterson is excellent. The film editing by Leslie Jones is excellent. The casting by Juel Bestrop and Jeanne McCarthy is excellent. The production design by Ed Verreaux and costume design by Louise Mingenbach is brilliant. This movie is without a doubt, funny.</p></body></html>

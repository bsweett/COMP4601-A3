The visual effects may look cheesy now but for 1984, it was revolutionary. That's 21 years ago! The movie was directed by James Cameron and was followed up by an even better sequel. Buy this one and Terminator 2: Judgement Day and rent T3: Rise of the machines, and you'll be in for a true treat.<br /><br />This one is about a cyborg sent from the future in the past/ present to kill Sarah Connor because she would give birth to a son that would lead the resistance against the machines. Arnold plays the machine/ Cyborg/ robot and he's big, mean, and just awesome. He tears out a page from the phone book, and decides to kill every Sarah Connor. The movie is absolutely wonderfully made. But a man is also sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor.<br /><br />The movie is very suspensful and absolutely brilliant thanks to Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and Arnold Schw.. as the evil cyborg. Arnold barely talks but has an evil stare with a very mean look. He does have some awesome catch phrases such as "I'll be back!".<br /><br />When you watch this movie, remember that it's a classic and that it made Arnold famous. Just look at his eye contact and facial expressions. That shows everything. Also, don't laugh at how cheesy some scenes are, it was made 21 years ago! The special effects in this movie were AMAZING FOR THE TIME! So, just sit back and enjoy a classic.</p></body></html>

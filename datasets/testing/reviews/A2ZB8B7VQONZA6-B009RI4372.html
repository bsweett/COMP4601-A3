<meta name="summary" content="THE BOOK OF SAM RAMI AND FRIENDS"></head><body><p>EVIL DEAD<br /><br />First all I can say is this is one of the greatest films ever made. All I can say is what in the [heck] was Sam Raimi thinking when he wrote this, if films were still written like this, classics would be in theaters all the time. It was a smart move for Raimi to direct this film because it put him right in the business. This film became an instant cult classic, the underground scene loved it. Of course you have to think right away of Bruce Campbell. This is the man that became famous because of this film; he did an excellent job in this film. I couldn't think of an EVIL DEAD without Bruce. The rest of the cast did great jobs to, Ellen SabdHal Delrich, Betsy Barker, and Sarah York. Of course we have to show some love to the crew working behind the scenes. But finally on to the movie.<br /><br />This is the DVD edition so I will first go over the special features. The behind the scenes and outtake reels are great, but the best are the commentaries. Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert the producer give an insightful commentary track while Bruce's is hilarious. Now to the film, even though there are more special features. The movie has a group of friends going for a get away in the woods in an old cabin. Once there the friends stumble across the book of the dead, and a recording. They play the recording and awake the dead. The friends fall one by one becoming these creatures all in one night, and when day breaks.......<br /><br />There is not enough time to go over how much I love this film it is absolutely one of my all time favorite films of all time. This is possibly part of the greatest series in the history of film; this group of friends that made these films are brilliant. All I have left to say is go buy not only this film but the next two in the series, EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS.</p></body></html>

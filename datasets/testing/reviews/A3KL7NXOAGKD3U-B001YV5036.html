This is the story of James J. Braddock, directed by Ron Howard, who in my opinion is one of the better directors out there, that can take a story like the Braddock story and make it shine for the big screen!! This is a story of perserverance, strength, and family. Russell Crowe stars as James Braddock, a New York native who at one time in the 20's was  a man who ran a taxi company, and owned stocks in many companies, till the great stock market crash in 1929. Within a years time, he lost everything, ending up in soup kitchens, and falling down on his luck, till he found the love of boxing.  He used this love to make ends meet and put food on the table for his family.  In the end, he became one of the best boxers of all time, defeating the likes of Joe Lewis, and the dreaded, and dangerous Max Baer (who himself has the title of killing two men in the ring).<br /><br />A great story about love, strength, and the will to succeed!!<br /><br />Watch this movie...you will love it!!</p></body></html>

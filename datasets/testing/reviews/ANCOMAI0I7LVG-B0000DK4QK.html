<meta name="summary" content="Not quite `hellish' enough..."></head><body><p>When you have a film by the name of `From Hell' that revolves around one of the most notorious and legendary serial killers of all time you kind of expect the terror to mount in unprecedented levels.  You salivate at the very idea of the film achieving and even surpassing all expectations as it devours you with that uneasy feeling of imminent repulsion and sheer dread.<br /><br />Despite fantastically realized production design and sharply implemented edits; `From Hell' loses most of its staying power thanks to a strange lack of fear.<br /><br />The film attacks the story of Jack the Ripper from the vantage point of a Scotland Yard sleuth by the name of Frederick Abberline.  Abberline has opium influenced visions of the slayings perpetrated by the Ripper, and so he uses these visions to further his investigation, picking away at the mystery behind the blood.  Along the way he is aided by a street walker (bet they weren't referred to as those in that day) and derailed by nearly everyone else.  Uncovering the truth behind the murders is apparently a dangerous journey; one that certain members of society would work their fingers to the bone to make sure went unfulfilled.<br /><br />When the opium induced fog has lifted, it becomes sadly apparent that `From Hell' is not all that it could have been.  For a film of such salacious subject, it is surprisingly mild.  Despite the influx of prostitutes there is barely a scene of sexuality, and the murders themselves are faintly hinted at or contain minor moments of shock gore that is forgettable and underwhelming.  This could have been forgiven had the films core been devoted to a more fleshed out and detailed depiction of the `inner monster' dealing these dastardly deeds, but instead the revelatory climax is weakened by a mere surface attempt at identifying a monster.  Sure, the film offers it's `viewpoint', but it under-works it.<br /><br />The film wants to be a horror film but it lacks the horror.<br /><br />Johnny Depp delivers the same performance he gives in all his other movies, and he does a decent enough job to escape my usual dismembering of his talent (the man just needs to go away).  Heather Graham tries her hardest here, but the script is so unkind to her (she could have handled a deeper character, don't you think) and it made her a forgettable clich&eacute;.  I love Ian Holm, and he definitely steals a lot of the audience's attention, but I feel that it isn't always in a good way.<br /><br />The uneven nature of the script (which really should have been reworked a few dozen times before production) does no justice to a tale that should be brandished upon the minds of all.  There are a few attempts to capitalize off of this particular tale; and this is probably the least successful.</p></body></html>

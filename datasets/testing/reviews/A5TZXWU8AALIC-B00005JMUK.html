<meta name="summary" content="The Disappearance of Charlize Theron"></head><body><p>MONSTER would still be a good movie without Charlize Theron...but after watching it a couple of times, it is fascinating to watch Ms. Theron literally disappear into this serial killer.<br /><br />For a woman who is used to walking red carpets and gracing magazine covers, she really becomes an ugly, badly-damaged woman hooking along lonely highways. There isn't a false note in any single frame of this movie. She deserved the Academy Award, that's for sure.<br /><br />From what I've seen in the documentaries about Aileen Wornos, this film humanizes her more, shifts a little away from her mental illness, and makes Christina Ricci's character more attractive, although it keeps her betrayal of Aileen at the end.<br /><br />This is a sad, frightening story about women on the outside and the lengths they'll go to find love and acceptance in a dark and horrible world. Even cold-blooded murder.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Phoenix" rises to the occasion"></head><body><p>I was apprehensive about going to see "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" because I was very disenchanted by the last film in the series, "Goblet of Fire." However, "Phoenix" surpassed all my expectations. There are a few small things about the movie that bothered me, but overall, I think it was brilliant.<br /><br />This film is based on the fifth novel in the Harry Potter series. I'm sure most people are familiar with the plot, but basically this is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, and it gets off to a very crappy start. The Ministry of Magic attempts to expel Harry from school because he used magic to defend himself when dementors attacked him and his cousin, Dudley. Also, the majority of people think that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are lying about the return of Lord Voldemort, and everyone treats Harry like he has the plague. To top it all off, the Ministry has appointed one of its own members, Dolores Umbridge, to fill the vacant position of Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts. Umbridge wastes no time wreaking havoc in the school and using all means necessary to put the Ministry's stamp on things. Meanwhile, Harry is distraught over mysterious dreams and visions that disturb him in his sleep. The film builds up to Harry's discovery of a new connection he has to Voldemort, and everything culminates in a violent encounter deep within the confines of the Department of Mysteries.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie. It was just as dark and gritty as I'd hoped it would be, and as it needed to be in order to stay true to the book. Obviously, a lot of material had to be cut for the film adaptation, but I think the screenwriters did an excellent job editing the unnecessary parts and making the story flow together so smoothly on screen.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite things about the film, along with a few gripes. (Warning: The rest of this review contains major spoilers, so continue reading at your own risk!)<br /><br />+ The new additions to the cast were amazing, especially the actresses who played Bellatrix LaStrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Bonham Carter is amazing in everything she does, and the first time I read "Phoenix," I knew she had to play Bellatrix...I just wish she had a bit more screen time! Staunton was absolutely perfect as Umbridge. I would have enjoyed seeing Umbridge's character be slightly more sinister at times, but really, I have no complaints. And as for Lynch, she was born to play the part of Luna Lovegood, hands down!<br /><br />+ The thestrals looked awesome, as did Kreacher the house elf.<br /><br />+ I thought Harry's relationship with Cho Chang was very sweet and well done. Their kiss under the mistletoe was so cute!<br /><br />+ The appearance of the Dark Mark tattoo on the Death Eaters was very well done: super creepy!<br /><br />+ The Ministry of Magic looked incredible in the film: it was just like I imagined it while reading the book. I was also quite impressed with the scene depicting the jailbreak from Azkaban: very slick!<br /><br />+ Generally, most of the plot changes were very slight and only served to better enhance the story for the screen (Harry seeing the memory of his father and Snape by using occlumency instead of spying in the pensieve; the Weasley twins only causing one major disturbance for Umbridge; etc.)<br /><br />- The character of Tonks (Natalia Tena) was introduced for the first time in this film. She looked really cool, but we didn't get to see much of her, which was a shame.<br /><br />- Speaking of missing characters, where the heck was Mundungus Fletcher?! His absence didn't really affect the plot of the movie too much, but I'm sure there were many fans of the book that were disappointed Mundungus was cut out altogether.<br /><br />- Rita Skeeter and Professor Lockhart were also missing from the film. Again, their absences didn't hurt the movie, but I was really hoping for a brief Kenneth Branagh cameo.<br /><br />- I don't understand why Kreacher's role in the whole trick involving Sirius wasn't played up more. We saw Kreacher twice, and Sirius even gave him the order to "go away," but no one ever explained how Kreacher was the one who helped Voldemort lure Harry into coming to the Ministry.<br /><br />- There was no Sirius/Snape confrontation. Major bummer!<br /><br />- We never saw Dumbledore instruct Snape to meet up with Voldemort and the rest of the Death Eaters. This is the one omission from the film that bothered me the most. The significance of that event plays a big part in book seven, so I wonder how it will be explained in the next film.<br /><br />- Although the final scenes at the Ministry were good, I was a little disappointed with the way Sirius was killed. He never really dueled it out with Bellatrix: she just sort of appeared and mumbled "avada kedavra" under her breath, and it was all over. It should have been much more dramatic with more build-up to it. Also, it was never explained how Dumbledore and the other members of the Order knew that Harry and his friends were at the Ministry that night. Finally, the whole Harry/Voldemort possession thing at the end was kind of weird. I guess all these things were done in the essence of time and to make things look more dramatic on screen, but I think it could have been a bit better.<br /><br />Despite a few minor flaws, "Phoenix" is possibly the best Harry Potter film yet. I think the movie really stayed true to the spirit of the book, and I enjoyed it very much. I'll probably go back to see it in the theatre at least once more.</p></body></html>

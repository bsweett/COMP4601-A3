Funding for the RUFs came from diamonds, mined by the enslaved people of the region and then exported to the western world.  The education you get on this film will really make you think, if you know don't know anything about it.  Personally, I was already aware of the internal problems of Africa.  It is a country in chaos.  At this time though, the city of Freetown on the west coast was particulary hit hard.<br /><br />The guilt trip the movie puts you through is unwarranted, as they state in the movie, the diamonds are mixed with stones from all over the world and then sold.  So there is no way the retailer would know, much less the consumer whether or not the stones they were buying are conflict diamonds.<br /><br />The movie follows the characters as they start on different paths but eventually come together to find the Fisherman's son.  Djimon Hounsou gives a strong performance as Solomon, a father desperate to find his family after he is taken by the Rebels to pan for diamonds.  When he finds one bigger then his thumb he hides it amid a raid on the Rebels.  After being taken to jail, Danny Archer (DiCaprio) catches wind of his find and eventually convinces him to split the diamond profits.  Along the way, Archer meets Maggie (Connelly) a journalist tired of writing about the atrocities and no one noticing.  She's looking for hard evidence to write the story of her career and Danny has that evidence since he's been dealing with the illegal aspect of the trade for years.<br /><br />The movie is a morality check amidst an action set piece.  The violence and gunfire add adrenaline to what could have been a boring political statement.  DiCaprio is excellent as usual and plays his part with world weary and pecimistic venom.  This is the first movie I've seen him in where he comes across as a man, and not a YOUNG man.  He seems mature, almost too mature for his age, implying he's seen too much for someone of his age.  And his military skills are very convincing.  Connelly plays the other side of the coin, pecimistic as well but hopeful that word will get out and things will change in Africa.<br /><br />Eventually, things get wrapped up but not before there is a lot of sacrifice.  Some other reviews state it is a neat and tidy ending, but I disagree.  It doesn't come without death and lives changed forever.  The movie is thrilling and thought provoking even if not perfect.  I recommend it.</p></body></html>

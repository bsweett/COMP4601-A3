Anything with Hugh Grant qualifies as a date movie, while "Fried Green Tomatoes" is a chick flick. "Beaches" is a chick flick. "Steel Magnolias" is most definetly a chick flick. "Tombstone"...well, if you like spicy hot buffallo wings dripping with bleu cheese, cold beer, and football, this movie is for you.<p>Critics of "Tombstone" -- and you know who you are -- point out its cliched plot, which is more or less based on the real-life fued between ex-lawman Wyatt Earp and his brothers Morgan and Virgil, and their friend John "Doc" Holliday, and a gang of transplanted Texas outlaws called the Cowboys, which culminated in the world's most famous shoot-out, the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. They point out that some of the dialogue is stilted and hokey, if not outright ridiculous. They shake their heads at gunfights which rage for minutes with no one troubling to reload and the villains seemingly unable to hit anything except trees, windows, dirt, and if they are very lucky, the non-lethal areas of our heroes. I look upon these souls with pity. Because they are missing the whole point of this classic, pen-ultimate "guy" film: GUILTY PLEASURE.<p>Like football, beer, and the afformentioned spicy chicken wings, "Tombstone" is not good. It is just fun. I would even argue that movies like this are the whole reason movies were invented in the first place (and keep in mind the first silent pictures were Westerns). You can save your message-laden morality plays and Oscar-grubbing prestiege pictures for when you are trying to impress your girlfriend's parents at dinner, because after desert, chances are your future father-in-law will light up a stogie and fire up this DVD over that copy of "Yentel" on the coffee table. And thank goodness for that! Would you rather watch Barbara Streisand in drag or Kurt Russel bash some foul-mouthed cowboy over the head with his own .44?<p>How can you go wrong with a cast that includes apparently every working character actor in Hollywood? In addition to Kurt Russel (Wyatt) and Val Kilmer (Doc), you've got Sam Elliot (Virgil), Bill Paxton (Morgan), Billy Bob Thorton (the very unfortunate Faro dealer), Powers Boothe (Curly Bill), Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo), Michael Rooker, Charlton Heston (yes, Charlton Heston), Jason Priestly (Billy), Billy Zane (the actor in the kilt), and even that guy that played Lowell on "Wings" ? The answer is, you can't. This (Vista) DVD is money well spent, because in addition to a few minutes of extra footage (which, by and large, doesn't add much to the viewing experience) there is a supplementary disc loaded with extras. As if you needed them!<p>The flick opens with a demonstration of first-class villainy on the part of the Cowboys, who are led by the cheerful, opium-smoking and apparently insane Curly Bill Brosius, and his right-hand man, the homicidal gunslinger Johnny Ringo. They crash the wedding of a Mexican lawman and substitute the traditional throwing of rice with the throwing of lead. This establishes them as worthy bad guys, and the credits haven't even rolled yet!<p>Cut to the arrival in Tombstone of Wyatt Earp, played by Russel. Wyatt is a weary former town marshal with, shall we say, a phyiscal approach to problem solving. Before he has spoken a word of dialogue, he hosswhips a stablehand for maltreating his trusty steed. Minutes later, he strolls into a salloon and gives loudmouth card dealer Billy Bob Thorton perhaps the most humiliating verbal and physical thrashing in cinematic history, spitting out lines like "Are you gonna do something about it, or just stand there and bleed?" before tossing him out through the swinging doors. And this is just his first day in town! Wait until he gets comfortable!<p>Wyatt is joined not only by his brothers, but by his tuburculois-stricken gunman-gambler pal Doc Holliday, who gets even better dialogue than Wyatt, and gets to say it in a marvelous Tidewater-aristocratic drawl while strolling about town in his cape. The only thing deadlier than Doc's three-gun pistol rig is his own death-wish. Never mess with a man whose motto is: "Say when!"<p>Wyatt, Doc and Co. have made the ultimate Western mistake. They have Tried To Leave the Past Behind Them. Fools! Don't they know that only breeds mayhem?<p>Now, understand that Tombstone, Arizona in 1889 is like a college town the day before graduation where in addition to being drunk and violent, all the men are carrying guns and big ... buck knives. The Cowboys run the show and don't rightly appreciate Mr. Earp and his pals throwing their weight around. Before long, insults turn to fisticuffs, which turns to gunplay, which turns to Wyatt Earp using his boot spur to give cowardly Ike Clanton a no-frills facial massage, saying, "All right you cur! You've called down the thunder....you tell 'em I'm coming, and hell's coming with me!"<p>When Wyatt says stuff like that, you should take him at his word.<br />Stupidly, the Cowboys don't, and luckily for us, the OK Corral shootemup is just the beginning of the mayhem. Suffice to say by the time the final credits roll, Boot Hill is a growth industry.<p>This is a great, fun movie that is not meant to be taken seriously, as Kevin Costner's pompous, overdrawn "Wyatt Earp" apparently was. It's just entertainment, and the actors, most especially Val Kilmer, have a blast living out their childhood fantasies of playing Once Upon a Time in the West. You will too. Like Wyatt, "I'll take my oath on it."  <p>The fight's commenced, folks....now get to fightin' or get away!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A sequel you could have though up yourself..."></head><body><p>If you caught and enjoyed "Meet the Parents" a few years back, you might have, in a second, brainstormed the idea that became inevitable sequel.  Take the same idea, toss in an annoying set of parents for Ben Stiller who are liberal and extroverted counterpoints to Deniro's uptight and competitive waspy-ness, toss in the same jokes and let the script work its magic.  You know the result wouldn't have knocked your socks off, but then you're not a Hollywood writer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, "Meet the Fockers" goes no further than the hash of ideas you might have had after unreeling "Meet the Parents".  The Fockers are liberal and liberating jewish counterpoints to the Byrneses, and the turbulent meeting between the two of them would entrap Ben Stiller's character in a series of embarrassing snags (the most egregious involving sodium pentathol, the teenage son of the Focker's hottie cook, Mr. Byrnes's prodigal grandson, and a simulated latex breast designed by Deniro's character).  The script tries to brainstorm the twists of the first movie (remember how none of Focker's stories panned out after a records check because his name had been changed?) but comes up short.  Most of the subplots seemed forced (like Stiller's father getting all three of them arrested) and by the end, you're more relieved than amused.</p></body></html>

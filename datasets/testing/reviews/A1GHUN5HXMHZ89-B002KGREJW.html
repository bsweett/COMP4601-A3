<meta name="summary" content="Little Miss Sunshine"></head><body><p>Most families will enjoy this because most families aren't mental about making their young daughters look like street women for a beauty contest. I found this movie refreshing and I loved the family. Each member was developed exceptionally well. We see the typical family with it's highs and lows. The underbelly if you will of a realistic family and not some reality show which is more made up than the charaterizations in this movie. I recommend this if you enjoy melodramas. After all what is comedy without some drama? Good quality DVD with minimum extras. Decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Best in Show" and "As Good as it Gets".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

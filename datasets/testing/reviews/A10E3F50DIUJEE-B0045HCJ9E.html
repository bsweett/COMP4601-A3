<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock and Grant!!"></head><body><p>Cary Grant has to be the quintessential Hitchcock male (if Grace Kelly is his blonde)!  So suave and charismatic, he is just splendid as the playboy who is mistaken for a government agent.  This mistaken identity (a favorite plot point for Hitch) leads Cary Grant on a cross country journey that culminates in one of the most unforgettable cinematic scenes at Mt. Rushmore.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is splendid as the double agent helping and bumbling Grant along the way.<br /><br />This is a truly great film: filled with comedy and mayhem, as well as murder and political intrigue.  Anyone could fall in love with this movie.</p></body></html>

You know what I'm talking about, man?<br /><br />No? Well, it's called the Slippery Slope Theory of Adventure: let's say you're bored, rich, jaded, in search of something funky. You start out with porn: first you're letting the wild rumpus begin to beach pix of Lindsay Lohan, then you're scouting for videos in the wee hours of the morning in stores with their windows taped up, and finally you're arranging private audiences with German acrobats in cellar rooms full of vaseline and studded with plenty of hydraulics.<br /><br />You follow me? No? My point is: that's the Slippery Slope. The first time, you're wheezing, sweating, panting with excitement. The second time you break a sweat. The third time you're going through the motions, maybe noticing the pattern of the wallpaper.<br /><br />Still don't follow me? Fine, let's talk about these three idiots---two American, one Icelandic---who get bored of whoring around in Amsterdam and take the advice of a Balkan Svengali to move their tail-chasing to points East: points considerably *far* East, to wit, Slovakia, where War and Horror have left few men, and many hungry women. And if you're American, man, they'll do anything, anything...<br /><br />OK, let's put away the toothbrush, the chainsaw, and the lighter fluid for a sec, alright? Before we get started, something should be said for the slow-burn way in which Eli Roth lets this whole Cauldron Boil thing get started: "Hostel" takes its own sweet time to wind up. Once it winds up it's like some kind of mechanized Destroying Angel, but props to Roth for taking his time to wind up this litle outrigger of grimness and grue.<br /><br />So this is "Hostel": the tale of a bunch of drunkenly feral little meat-eaters, happy cannibals, who unwittingly clamber into the cooking pot and get served to even hungrier diners. Or, rather, a madcap escapade of three Strangers in a very Strange Land, Paxon (Jay Hernandez), Josh (the winsome Derek Richardson), & Oli (the egregious Ethor Gundjonsson), who venture East huning fresh meat and find themselves the main course.<br /><br />All the rest is art, anchored by some damned fine performances and cinematographic witchery: the shriek of the damned in the death-room; the goatish insistence on language barrier as truncheon; the bite of stainless steel through unwitting flesh and bone; the waspish buzz of the chainsaw howling off tile and blood-smeared concrete.<br /><br />But the real question in Hostel, itself a witches' brew of "Lonely Planet" & "The Most Dangerous Game", is this: given enough money, and ample privacy, and total security and secrecy---well, would you?<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

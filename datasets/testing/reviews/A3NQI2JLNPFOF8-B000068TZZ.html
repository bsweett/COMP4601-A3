Thank god this was independent with Tarentino in complete control.  Can you imagine this film without the pointless dialogue?  Can you imagine it without the diner scene in the beginning?  Or without the scenes in the car talking about the differences between white and black women or Mr. Orange's extensive knowledge of blacksploitation films?  A major part of Tarentino's charm is his writing.  It's wonderful that he finally got this chance to direct a film the way he wanted.  It's apparent that the studios who bought the True Romance and Natural Born Killers scripts from Q.T. weren't willing to take a chance with allowing him to direct the films.<br /><br />In regards to the ear slicing scene, the below reviewer is correct.  It never actually shows the ear being cut off.  But if you'd like to see it anyway, check out the alternate angle that has a camera pointed right at the ear (you can tell it's prosthetic but it was never really meant to be seen up close).  It's not part of the original movie but fun nonetheless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the all-time war movie greats."></head><body><p>"Bridge Over the River Kwai" is an Oscar winning World War II film, loosely based on a book by the French writer Pierre Boulle.  However, Hollywood had to change the plot to make it more palatable to American viewers by introducing an American star into the cast.  The plot was also modified to accommodate a greater role for women: one female beauty makes a brief appearance, and several Asian women absent from the original novel play a key supporting role towards the end.<p>What makes this movie a gem is not just the exciting plot, although that is an essential ingredient in making this a successful movie.  A British contingent of soldiers in a Japanese prisoner of war camp are required to build a bridge across the river Kwai for the Japanese.  But because this bridge is a threat to the Allies, they send in a troop of commandos to destroy the bridge.  There is only one problem: the British commander (Colonel Nicholson) who built the bridge has taken so much pride in the construction work of his soldiers, that he does not want it destroyed.  The tension rises to heart-stopping levels, with a thrilling climax.  There is some violence in the movie, but it is minimal and only towards the end, and unlike modern war movies there is no focus on the gory details.  The climax features stunning scenes that at the time were unprecedented in movie making history.  And the ambiguity of the conclusion leaves plenty of room for after-movie discussion and contemplation.<p>But what really makes this movie so stellar is the characterization and the psychological conflict at the beginning of the movie.  What the second half of the movie offers in terms of intrigue and action, is more than matched by the psychological conflict in the first half.  The Japanese commander of the prisoner of war camp (Colonel Saito) requires British officers to perform manual labour.  Colonel Nicholson insists that this is contrary to the Geneva Convention, and together with his officers refuses to comply.  This battle of personalities is the feature of the first part of the movie and is compelling, gripping, and involves brilliant acting.  The repeated notion of "madness" also hints at underlying themes about the futility of war, making this a profoundly anti-war movie.  This is evident in the complete reversal of the British colonel's attitude to his officers working and the final lines of the movie about "madness".<p>Although not suitable for younger viewers because of the occasional intensity of the action and the themes of war, "The Bridge On The River Kwai" is generally a clean and wholesome movie when compared with modern movies.  Given that the cinematography, characterization, and acting are all superb and thought-provoking (as well as the enduring whistling tune of the "Colonel Bogey March"), it is little wonder that this film rightly takes its place among the all-time war movie greats.  In fact it's easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

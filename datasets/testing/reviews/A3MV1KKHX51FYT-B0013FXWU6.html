<meta name="summary" content="The Worst Film of the Year?"></head><body><p>A man is digging beneath ground into rock. He falls and injures his leg. But the ore has gold and silver. Work continues. In a deep well oil bubbles out of the ground. [Was it this primitive in 1902?] Daniel Plainview does his own drilling, he is not dependent on contractors. He offers to work for others who have lands. A young man comes to Plainview with an offer. They settle a deal with cash and a handshake. The Sunday ranch is hardscrabble. [The film is slow paced.] They hunt quail and find surface oil. Plainview buys the ranch and seeks other lands in the area. Finding oil will make the community flourish.<br /><br />Eli Sunday preaches to cure the sick. [Was this a comment on current culture? The references to drinking suggest Prohibition.] They strike a gusher. Young H.W. is hurt. The oil well catches fire. Dynamite extinguishes the fire. H.W. has lost his hearing. Plainview attacks Eli Sunday when Eli asks for his money. Then Eli disrespects his father! Henry Plainview, his long-lost stepbrother, arrives; he has had bad luck. We learn something about the family. There is a new problem of a fire in the house. H.W. will be taken for a train ride. Some men want to buy out Plainview, and Plainview wants to buy out the lone holdout. He makes a deal with Union Oil. [The film is slow-paced.] There is a surprise involving the stepbrother! Is the surprise believable? Symbolism?<br /><br />William Bandy wants Plainview to be baptized and join his church to repent his sins and be saved. He has abandoned his child! [Is the church scene too emotional? What is the point?] Now the oil pipeline can go through to deliver low-cost energy to the people. [The film is slow-paced.] Do Plainview's actions suggest he is going insane? Now its 1927. Plainview has a mansion and a radio. H.W. is grown up, and decides to become independent. Will H.W. become a competitor? Does the conversation make sense? Is it a crazy ending? Was the ending a joke on the viewer? The bad ending to a bad movie? Was this the sickest film you've ever seen this year?<br />[This film was supposed to be based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel "Oil". Sinclair's novel must have been much better than this film.]</p></body></html>

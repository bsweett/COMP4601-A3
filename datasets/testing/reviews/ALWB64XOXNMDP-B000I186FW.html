<meta name="summary" content="Left me wanting to know more......."></head><body><p>I have to agree with a lot of what has been said about the film. The film left me wanting to know more about the man.  Being disfigured beneath the mask; I still wanted to see the face of the man.  What type of life did he lead before this?  What was his job? What made him want to act? These are all unanswered questions that make the movie less.  I didn't read the graphic novel.  I intend to if it answers any questions the film didn't.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen the Wachovski's first pass at the script.  It might have provided more answers than this final version.  It was a great film but I have to wonder if any of the best parts were left on the cutting room floor.....</p></body></html>

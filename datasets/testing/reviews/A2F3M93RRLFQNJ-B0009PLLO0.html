<meta name="summary" content="Alexander the Awful"></head><body><p>Alexander, Oliver Stone's contribution to the resurrected genre of sword-and-sandal epics, is a clear demonstration that you can make a movie that looks like it should be great and utterly fail.  This biopic of Alexander the Great flounders on almost every level and is probably most notable for making the overblown Troy seem good in comparison.<br /><br />Any scrutiny as to why this movie fails must begin with Colin Farrell who plays the title character.  Farrell, in the right context, is a decent enough actor, but he's out of his element here.  He is supposed to play a great leader, but is not believable in his role.  When Russell Crowe inspires his troops in Gladiator, we believe he's a good general; when Farrell does it in this movie, the only thing I'm inspired to do is eject the DVD (but somehow I resisted and stuck with the film to the end).  It is impossible to accept that this is a man who could command any real loyalty.<br /><br />Stone's direction is mediocre.  The battle sequences are not all that entertaining and his attempts to be "artistic" come off as merely pretentious.  With the sole exception of Val Kilmer, all the actors are either chewing the scenery (such as Angelina Jolie) or underdeveloped.  Unfortunately, Kilmer's decent performance is far from enough to carry this movie.<br /><br />At least a film like XXX - State of the Union doesn't pretend to be great, so when it fails, we're not all that disappointed.  Not so, here.  There is undoubtedly a good movie that could be made out of the life of Alexander the Great.  It hasn't arrived yet.  If it were a film of normal length, it might be worth viewing just to see how bad it is, but at three hours, it's probably better to skip it and watch another, shorter bad movie instead.  You'll still have wasted your time, but at least you'll have wasted less of it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NATALIE RULES!"></head><body><p>CLOSER is not a great movie and I'm not sure it makes you think about Life in ways that make up for its lack of greatness. But it is quite a watchable movie, if only for the brilliant star power of its four main and only characters: Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julie Roberts and Clive Owen. Owen, being the least well-known of the four, nevertheless manages to deliver the strongest performance, or has the best lines, in Mike Nichols' adaptation of Patrick Marber's play. But my favorite is Natalie Portman as Alice. She is beautiful and  sensational in this film, representing  - if I may speculate - Innocent Love. Her character is there to show how we can tragically screw up Innocent or True Love. And who hasn't? The other three characters in the story are busy hurting each other and essentially form a love triangle with Anna (Roberts) as the confused, sought-after prize. While Alice is the most innocent of the four she delivers the hardest and most honest blow at the end. She is really the only character to admire of the lot. I have been a devoted fan of Natalie Portman ever since BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and she doesn't disappont in  CLOSER. Basically a downer film, CLOSER nevertheless has some fine performances and the script is sound. The problem is that one is left questioning why four near-middle-aged, attractive, successful people willingly engage in such screwed-up, hurtful, juvenile relationships. One wonders if such a script got made into a movie due to Hollywood Myopia. That would explain in general why box office receipts have been falling off: Hollywood produces way too many movies like CLOSER which seemed targeted for a certain group of intellectual elite who think it chic to get depressed while being entertained; yet these kind of movies are artistically representative of the lives of only a fraction of ticket-buyers and are likely based on the writer's dysfunctional friends and relatives. Most of us in America, thank you, are basically happy types and don't want to be confronted with depressing subject matter when we go to the movies for a good time.</p></body></html>

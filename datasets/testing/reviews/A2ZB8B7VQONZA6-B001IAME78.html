<meta name="summary" content="HULK LIKE FILM, BUT HULK LOVE THREE DISC"></head><body><p>THE INCREDIBLE HULK<br /><br />I remember not so long ago when a film by Ang Lee hit the theaters that was called simply "Hulk", and I liked unlike a lot of others apparently. I still to this day can not see why people did not like that film because I thought it was really good. The character driven emotional study of this man/creature was perfect. Lee did a great job with the film in my opinion and while it was not a classic was still very good. But the overwhelming out cry for another so called "better' Hulk film was so much that they made this one. New cast, new crew, and even new Hulk were added to this one to please those who did not care for the first one. What they got was a film that was equally entertaining in my opinion I thought this was just as good as the last one and neither surpassed the other. They are two very different films and takes on the character and for that I view them separately and do not compare the two.<br /><br />This film is all about Banner [Edward Norton] trying to get in touch with some one who may be able to help get rid of his big green curse. It is in his search that the military can close in on him during their search. It is here that General Ross [William Hurt] and his number one soldier Emil Blonsky [Tim Roth] take their first failed shots at the Hulk. It is also here that Emil begins his obsession with battling him again. The story is basically your seek and destroy story from this point on with Ross's daughter trying her hardest to help Bruce as much as possible. So let the battles begin as they say with so many sides going against each other, and poor Hulk is caught in the middle, all Hulk want do is smash.<br /><br />Director Louis Leterrier really brought a whole other style to this film and quickens the pace up a bit as action is found throughout the film. To me both of the films are on the same level as I enjoyed both about the same, so I can't say that Louis did the better job. But if you want more action this one is for you as Zak Penn's script called for more action. Still the story is very fun and all the performances are great as well, Roth in particular. Tim Roth struck me as the perfect villain for this film and I really wish he would get more roles in theatrical films. Edward Norton was great as well as the new Bruce Banner and played the role perfectly. I still feel that the script could have beefed up Banner's character a little more so Norton could properly portray him, I felt the character [not performance] was a little underdeveloped. Still I really feel that Roth was the sow stealer here, he did a great job.<br /><br />Liv Tyler and William Hurt are great as the daughter and father Ross in this film, I remember never being a huge fan of Tyler back in the day but I have come to like her a now. I think it is because she looks just like some one I know [who I dislike], oh well. Also while every one in this film is great I must say seeing Lou Ferrigno in this was classic, as was Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr reprising his Tony Stark character [Avengers here we come, also in an opening scene Cap's shield is visible], and the LEGENDARY Rickson Gracie appearing as Banner's Aikido Instructor. I was super excited to see that as was my brother, loved it.<br /><br />Of course the special effects for the film are top notch as the two monsters that go at it on here look amazing, also the Hulk doesn't look cartoonish and Abomination looks great. As do all of the fights, explosions and such that come with this type of film. But I think the biggest story that came out of this was the comparisons between the two Hulk films. Like I said earlier I like both of them about the same, they are two very different films with very different styles. This three disc addition is packed full of all kinds of special features and is well worth the price of purchase, or at least I think so. I have to say I really enjoyed the commentary by the director and Tim Roth. I recommend watching both Hulk films as I enjoyed both myself. Also there are all kinds of features on this set so enjoy.</p></body></html>

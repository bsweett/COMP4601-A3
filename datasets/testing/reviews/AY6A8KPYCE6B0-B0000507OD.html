<meta name="summary" content="STUNNING 1080p!!!"></head><body><p>Movie-wise, Citizen Kane is quite the classic. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written on a level that is only comparable to Shakespeare. Like all timeless classics, age has not withered its potency, and 70 years later it is as relevant as ever and absolutely just as moving as it no doubt was back in 1941.<br /><br />Blu Ray-wise, it's even better. Movies this old should not look this good. It just doesn't seem right, and yet, here it is - presented absolutely perfectly without the tiniest flicker or grain, in stunning STUNNING 1080p that gives incredible details to old coats, snow flurries, mansions, facial expressions.. and, well, every single shot. It's glossy all the way throughout. This is NOT a low budget restoration, it's a transformation like no generation has yet to experience. If you think Blu Ray can only enhance modern, color spectacles, watch this movie. You will be proven wrong. In fact, some of my all-time favorite blu rays to show off my 1080p television are Black and White. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GX8Q">Casablanca [BLU-RAY</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JBI3GA">The Twilight Zone [Blu-ray</a>] are just some examples that dazzle a high definition screen. Citizen Kane is among the best, if not THE best, however, and has set the bar even higher. I'm so happy that this release was taken seriously.<br /><br />OVERALL: If you're a fan of this classic or have never seen it before, buy or rent this movie on blu ray. Relive it again as you've never experienced it before, or watch it for the first time and be prepared to be amazed. Either way, I urge you to take advantage of this new HD technology. Movies, especially old movies, will never be the same.<br /><br />~~Rosebud~~</p></body></html>

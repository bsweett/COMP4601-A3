<meta name="summary" content="IRON DOWNEY"></head><body><p>Wow, this film rocks, it's up their with Spider Man II as the best of the Marvel films.  Downey is great as Stark, he's all charisma and steel will.  Downey has fantastic chemistry with Paltrow, frankly im not her biggest fan, but I really liked he in this, mainly because she perfectly played off of Downey.  Bridges is chilling as Starks nemisis, it's weird to see him bald, but it added to his chilling look.  The CGI Ironman is incredible and his battle with Bridges at the end was spectacular.  I appreciated how the screenwriter wove issues we have today into the formula of the movie, it made it resonate all the more.  I could not recommend this movie any higher, it is a must see if your into this sort of action fick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Comedy Noir"></head><body><p>This was the first time I saw The Big Lebowski, so I was not attuned to the fine points of the re-release "Collector's Edition".  I just enjoyed the creative Coen brothers masterpiece of characters and vibrant yet dark and twisted plot.  The Big Lebowski is just a fantastic engaging steady stream of laughs.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges (the "Dude" Lebowski), John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Julianne Moore are the stars and unforgetable as they go on a journey of mistaken identity, White Russians, kidnapping, bowling championships, and the Los Angeles underworld.<br /><br />The Big Lewbowski is a hilarious comedy noir full of colorful bizarre characters.</p></body></html>

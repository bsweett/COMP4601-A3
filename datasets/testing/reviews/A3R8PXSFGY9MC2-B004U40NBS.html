<meta name="summary" content="Black Swan"></head><body><p>`Black Swan' is the acclaimed psychological drama starring Natalie Portman as an over-stretched, tense and neurotic ballerina.<br /><br />When Nina (played by Portman) wins the star role in the ballet Swan Lake she is informed she will also have to play the role of the black swan as well. Whilst she is well suited for the Queen swan role, she finds it harder to access the emotions needed for the black swan role. This film follows her as she searches for this character within her, whilst dealing with an over-bearing mother, a sexual predator dance director and a jealous fellow dancer. Soon the cracks begin to show and her neurosis' come flooding out.<br /><br />It is shocking to see the lengths the ballet dancers go to in the name of perfection and whilst some of the behaviours are nothing new (like starving oneself, vomiting, excessive work loads and colleague animosity), they are still disturbing to watch. You feel that although Nina is a very fragile and neurotic person, she also doesn't get any type of support either.<br /><br />This film feels very weird at times as Nina loses herself in her role, which only heightens the sense of Nina's breakdown and her fragile mental state. There are lots of minor hallucinations throughout which lead up to the films crescendo and the ending, despite being mildly clich&eacute;d, does have an impact.<br /><br />Portman acts very well and gives this film it's required edge and Kunis is great as the self assured jealous dancer. Winona Ryder shows up briefly as the outgoing ballet star and overall all three actresses give top performances. The direction is also very good and you can see why this film was so lauded at it's cinematic release.<br /><br />This is a very good film and whilst it feels disjointed and confusing at times, this is all part of the plot and keeps the film edgy and tense. This is well worth a watch and while I won't be watching it again anytime soon, I am glad I took the time to view it now.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A strange little movie"></head><body><p>I suppose if you're a woman under 40 who also happens to love The Graduate despite being a woman under 40, this might be your favorite film ever.<br /><br />As it is, while Jennifer Aniston is charming in an exactly like her role on Friends way, and you feel badly for Mark Ruffalo, who plays her fiance whose biggest crime seems to be not being Kevin Costner, this falls sort of flat.<br /><br />It's clever in a borderline obsessive-compulsive about the Graduate and (sort of strangely) the city of Pasadena way, but that's not really sufficient for a recommendation.</p></body></html>

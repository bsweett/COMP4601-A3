<meta name="summary" content="good blu ray with lots of  extras."></head><body><p>This series was a incredible intricate affair. This is how it begins and they crash onto the mystical island.  They DO NOT ALL DIE, as some people mistakenly later claimed after the end of series six. In fact , their adventures on the island are all too real. And they begin here and on blu ray you get the same extras but the picture is just fantastic , much better than on the dvd. I think that this series is worth your time. And you can now watch it all on blu ray.</p></body></html>

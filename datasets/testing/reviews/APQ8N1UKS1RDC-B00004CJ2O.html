<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BEST TITLES EVER TO A HORROR FILM!"></head><body><p>I saw this on the big screen in the summer of 80.<br />Everyone jumped at the scene of the REAL Jason<br />Voorhees grabbing the lone survivor it was a real<br />treat. I have to confess that I liked 13th more than,<br />than now. Now that I am older and have seen more HORROR<br />films 13th just is not that great. Oh! it has it's<br />moments like the scene of Kevin Bacon getting the arrow<br />head through the neck. And Betsy Palmer decapitation scene.<br />Tom Savini's F/X are in true form. Why only three stars.<br />The plot was pretty thin,the acting was well.....When the<br />camp counselors die I do not feel pity. Also for you<br />lovers of 13 see Mario Bava's Twitch of the Death Nerve<br />also known as Bay of Blood. When you see this movie which<br />Bava single-handedly invented the "Body Count" in 1971<br />YOU WILL SAY TO YOURSELF...WHAT! This was before The 13th?<br />For you lovers of 13th I am not trying to put it down.<br />I own this movie and would not be happy if I did not have<br />it in my CREEPY collection.  I just have to say though truth<br />be told it is in my opinion the 2nd MOST overrated HORROR<br />film next to SCREAM! Love the title though.</p></body></html>

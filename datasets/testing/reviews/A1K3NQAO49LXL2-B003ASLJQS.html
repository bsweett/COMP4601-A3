Of course, it's really all about the moral ambiguity of Sean Penn, which we see in every single scene of the film (although we don't know it at the time). Tim Robbins is fantastic as the mortally screwed-up Dave, who was kidnapped as a child by child molesters under the eyes of his two friends. As adults, their lives intersect over the murder of Penn's daughter. Nothing is as it seems, and the unravelling of the story is fascinating. Unfortunately, there's a superfluous sub-plot over Kevin Bacon's estranged wife, who has escaped to New York to give birth anonymously to their child. While it seems superfluous, it may also serve to display that Bacon's character, while he has his problems, got off the lightest of the three.<br /><br />The film was made in Boston, so it has a "The Departed" feel to it somehow. I have been to Boston, but I didn't get a feeling like this about the place. I should ask my friends from there how the fims rate.</p></body></html>

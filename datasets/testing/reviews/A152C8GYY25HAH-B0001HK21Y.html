<meta name="summary" content="4th Lecter movie thriller stands on its own"></head><body><p>"Red Dragon" is a movie I liked better the second time I saw it. The first time I thought it was made merely to capitalize on our fascination with brilliant arch villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. There is some validity to this opinion since the book by Thomas Harris, the first of three in which Lecter is featured, was filmed in 1986 under the title of `Manhunter". [The first version, by the way, is a very good movie.] The second viewing, however, convinced me that, for whatever reason it was made, "Red Dragon' stands on its own as a first-rate thriller. <p>The movie opens with a chilling encounter between FBI agent Will Graham [Edward Norton] and Lecter [Anthony Hopkins]. Just as Graham realizes that Lecter is the serial killer he has been looking for, Lecter attacks and nearly kills him. Graham survives, and Lecter is captured and incarcerated for life in a mental institution. Traumatized by the ordeal, Graham retires to Florida with his wife and young son. A few years later his old boss [Harvey Keitel] lures him back to help find another killer dubbed The Tooth Fairy. Finding himself in a dead end with the case, Graham reluctantly seeks the assistance of his old nemesis, Dr. Lecter, whose help turns out to be Graham's worst nightmare come to life. <p>Part of the success of "Red Dragon" is due to its `dream' cast. Besides Norton and Hopkins, it has Ralph Fiennes as the killer in question and Emily Watson as a blind woman the Tooth Fairy falls for. Other assets include the astute screenplay by Ted Tally, who penned the one for "Silence of the Lambs', and the chilling musical score by Danny Elfman. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the assured direction by Brett Ratner, heretofore known as the director of fun but forgettable comedies such as "Rush Hour" and "Family Man".  <p>If you are expecting this movie to top the classic "Silence of the Lambs", you may be disappointed. If you view it on its own terms, you may see it as very good - not extraordinary, perhaps, but way above ordinary.</p></body></html>

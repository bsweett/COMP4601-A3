Lector is played by Anthony Hopkins, so right away you come to realize that this should be a good remake.  This movie does not disappoint you on that end. The story line was the exact same as Manhunter, no changes.  The screenplay, however, was a better adaptation, so many of my questions about Lector were answered whereas Manhunter left me "hanging".  Hannibal is in jail and helps the FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton)---who he nearly killed and eaten a few years before--- catch a new serial killer, "The Tooth Fairy".  This time "The Tooth Fairy" is played by Ralph Fiennes.  I have to admit I liked Tom Noonan's "Tooth Fairy" better.  Overall this remake of Manhunter, in my opinion, is superior, except for the portrayal of "The Tooth Fairy".  Also since the time line happens before "Silence of the Lambs", more could have been done to make Hopkins look younger.  Overall an excellent and entertaining film!  Please watch this before you watch Silence of the Lambs, and enjoy!</p></body></html>

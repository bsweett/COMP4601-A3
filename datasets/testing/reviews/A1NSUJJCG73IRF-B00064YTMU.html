<meta name="summary" content="Collateral  (2004)"></head><body><p>Director:  Michael Mann<br /><br />Cast:  Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill.<br /><br />Rated R for lots of violence and language.<br /><br />Running Time:  120 minutes.<br /><br />Michael Mann, director of great films such as "Heat" and "The Insider", distributes another fine, tense thriller with "Collateral".  Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx star in extremely original roles for both:  Cruise as a bounty-hunter-like hit man who appears more like a cyborg terminator than a regular human being and Foxx as a timid cab driver who is continuously in search of his dreams.<br /><br />While Max (Jamie Foxx) is on his routine Los Angeles cabbie job, he unfortunately picks up the fast-talking, intense Vincent (Cruise).  Vincent coerces Max to drive for him throughout the night for an extra profit, not knowing what horrific events are to unfold.  When the body of one of Vincent's victims lands on the top of car, Max realizes that this night is going to be like no other in the big city.  The strange duo drives from hit to hit, each creating more and more tension between them.  "Collateral" breezes along with crafty fashion to the electrifying climax in which Max must save a prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) from the wraith of the merciless contract killer.<br /><br />Cruise is spectacular in his role, bringing incredible wit and savvy to his character.  Just as in "Jerry Maguire" and "Top Gun", his performance as Vincent is one that he was born to play.  Foxx delivers his second best performance of the year (behind his Oscar-worthy work in "Ray") as the John Doe bus driver who just wants a better life for himself.  As the night escalates from a regular and peaceful to tormenting and fanatical, Foxx shows the audience the transformation of this ordinary man into a hero.  Director Michael Mann does a proficient job using the city of Los Angeles throughout the film, creating beautiful pans of the eloquent buildings and roadways that add to the angst of the picture.  A splendid rogue of a film, splicing elements of "Taxi Driver", "The Terminator", and the formula for the 80's slasher flicks.  The only downfall of the film is that writer Stuart Beattie's screenplay attempts to add a layer of philosophical inquiry throughout the film (particularly one taxi scene involving both Max and Vincent), but it does not seem to quite fit.  An excellent effort of terror and suspense.  One of the most unique of its kind.  All fans of Cruise will thoroughly enjoy.</p></body></html>

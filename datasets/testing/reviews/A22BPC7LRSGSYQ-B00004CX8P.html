<meta name="summary" content="A western with a sense of realism for a change"></head><body><p>Unforgiven (1992) won four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor, and Editing).  Directed by Clint Eastwood, this western stars Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Frances Fisher, and Anna Levine.<br /><br />Gene Hackman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Little Bill Daggett.<br /><br />There have been so many great reviews written, so I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.<br /><br />The story itself is intriguing.  It's basically about two retired outlaws who come out of retirement to collect a bounty.  A group of prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming offer $1,000.00 to anyone who can kill two cowboys that had disfigured one of the prostitutes.  The local sheriff does not like what's going on, as he does not allow firearms or assassins in his town.<br /><br />In Kansas, William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is visited by The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who tries to recruit Munny to kill the cowboys.  Munny recruits his old riding partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  Together they head west to Big Whiskey, Wyoming.  Do they get the job done?  Watch to find out.<br /><br />The atmosphere and feel of the Old West town was captured very thoroughly, as was the scenery of the western U.S., particularly the mountains of Wyoming.  This DVD's clarity is outstanding.<br /><br />The best acting comes from Gene Hackman, in my opinion.  He plays a mean and heartless sheriff very well.<br /><br />All in all, a great western movie that's a little different than typical westerns.  This one is more realistic, darker, and the characters have a lot of depth to them.  They definitely aren't shallow characters.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

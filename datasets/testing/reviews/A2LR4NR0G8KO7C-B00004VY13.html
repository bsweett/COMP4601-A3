You can almost feel the tension between the scientist team as they are stuck in the middle of nowhere with an alien that can be anyone of them.<br />Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast make it all look very convincing and the movie simply does not let you go from the start. The special effects are still solid even today, which is amazing considering the year the movie was made.<br />(SARR)</p></body></html>

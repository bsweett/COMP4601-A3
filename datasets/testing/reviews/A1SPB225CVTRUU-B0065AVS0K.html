<meta name="summary" content="Mickey Rourke's Career Revival Role!"></head><body><p>Frank Miller's Sin City is by far the best comic book adapted film in recent years. It's got very well written characters, and the often brutal and stylish actions is very unique and refreshing along with the mostly black and white cinematography. It's a very entertaining movie, but it's not easy to follow for anyone who hasn't read the graphic novels, because it's got three interconnecting stories that isn't neccessarily consistent in it's time frame. Also the over two hour long film is obviously heading for some sequels since the story didn't end when the movie was over.<br /><br />This is probably Mickey Rourke's career revival role since he has the juicest role that require him to looked semi-distorted, very muscular, endure various heavy-duty fight scenes, and he's got some very funny moments as well. With more screen time compared to other leads, it's unfortunate that he didn't even receive top billing like Willis, Alba, and Owen. He played Marv, and he's a street wise guy trying to track down the man who killed his hooker girlfriend Goldie(Jaime King). Kevin(Elijah Wood) is the scary and skillful hooker-eating mute that became Marv's relentless target. Elijah Wood had several scenes that consisted of fights with Marv, and he's so creepy different than his Frodo character.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is Hartigan, and he's the only good cop left when everyone else is corrupted. He was betrayed by his colleque Bob(played by the underused Michael Madsen) when he helped saved a little girl named Nancy Callahan, and ended up in jail for eight years. Nancy(Jessica Alba) grew up to become a pole dancer at a night club, and she eventually fell in love with Hartigan despite the age difference. Jessica Alba is very stunning on stage, and she was pretty convincing when she had to French kiss Willis.<br /><br />Clive Owen played the "Babe Magnet"/Dwight, who had a thing for helping the local prostitutes through hard times. Rosario Dawson is Gail, the leader of a group of highly skilled prostitutes. She was in some serious trouble when Miho(Devon Aoki) mistakenly killed Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro) and his men. Jackie Boy is an abusive husband to Shellie(Britanny Murphy), and a corrupted cop. Since Dwight has a thing for Gail, he was willing to do anything to bail her out. Devon Aoki is very striking as the lethal assasin with great martial arts skills and works as Gail's top sidekick.<br /><br />Other secondary characters include Yellow Bastard/Rourk junior(Nick Stahl), Senator Rourk(Powers Boothe),and Lucille(Carla Gugino) are very well played even though they have limited screen time.</p></body></html>

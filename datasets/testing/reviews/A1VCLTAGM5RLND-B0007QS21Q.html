It is easy to forget there is an interesting storyline here with all the explosions going on, but that being said, the scene in the tunnel is right up there with the Matrix assault on the government building where Morpheus is being held. You can re-watch just that scene over and over to enjoy. Still, the reason this movie works is because it is good science fiction first and an action movie second. Asimov has always had social commentary at the forefront of his writing.</p></body></html>

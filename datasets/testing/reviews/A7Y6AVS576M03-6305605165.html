<meta name="summary" content="Often One can Find Hope in our World"></head><body><p>This is a classic film without a doubt. When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say. When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope. Someone somewhere does care. You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it. You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly. Yet, he perseveres. My heart goes out to him in this film. He just seems so sincere. Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart. Thank you so much for this film.</p></body></html>

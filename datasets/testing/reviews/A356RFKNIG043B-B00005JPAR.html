For others, boring as hell."></head><body><p>4.444 stars<br /><br />I'm not certain The Fountain is a great film, but beyond question it is a true work of art.<br /><br />Watching this shimmering movie was mesmerizing, pleasantly confusing, thought-provoking on many levels, and perhaps too void of narrative push for some (see the many one-star reviews here, some of which make strong cases; for those who need plot movement, this is a slog). I for one loved the experience; it took my mind to places very very few movies have or can, and that in itself makes it a must for those who love to watch their own mind at work, as well as that of an increasingly masterful filmmaker.<br /><br />Clearly Aronofsky is in both categories, and what a mind his is to watch. His grasp of symmetry, both visually and conceptually, peaks in this film. Pi is farther out but The Fountain is deeper, the work of a much more emotionally mature man than Pi or Requiem, and miles afield from his recent breakthrough The Wrestler. I'm betting this guy has a film or two in him that will stun the world into submission, at which point his oeuvre will be reexamined and gasps of awe will issue forth over this little gem.<br /><br />Orrr, maybe not. It is indeed amazing that this was followed by The Wrestler, as two more disparate films are hard to imagine. I for one think this is a much finer film; maybe if Mickey Rourke had made his comeback in The Fountain it would be the one with all the acclaim.<br /><br />In any case, this is a truly unique and gorgeous movie, with many shots of breathtaking beauty and classical symmetry. DA sure can frame a scene, and I didn't notice the camera itself once during the flick, a rare event, expecially for a movie as concerned with cinematic perfection as this. The plot lines, such as they are, are also driving towards the cores of human existence: dealing with death, wishing for ever more time with those we love, and luxuriating in the moment before it and we are whisked away into the void.<br /><br />Speaking of which, there is a perfectly luscious visual moment with the tree of life and the stars and Jackman (who gives a very strong performance, as usual) during which the missus and I were sitting on the sofa, engrossed in the spectacle (this movie makes blu-ray and a nice big flat screen make perfect sense), when our dog suddenly started having a dream on the floor behind us. You know how they quiver and yip and move their paws like they're chasing God's own squirrel through the celestial meadows in Dog Heaven? I love the sound she makes when she's dreaming, and as I sat beside my human sweetie, holding her hand, eyes on the sumptuous montage of realities onscreen depicting and ears on our pooch off in her own little dream world--a place I often wonder about but will never see in this lifetime--I realized very clearly that I was in the midst of my own perfect little synchronistic moment in space and time and soaked in it with a smile, feeling the love and ease as deeply as I could and knowing that one day this moment will be like manna that I can enjoy at will.<br /><br />Any movie that can help raise one's consciousness of self-awareness like that while simultaneously creating a field of knowledge which demands your surrender (plot junkies take note) must perforce be something special. Thanks and praises to Darren Aronofsky for even trying to make movies devoid of profit motive, let alone getting them made with this much love and precision. If Leonardo Da Vinci and Terence McKenna ever meet upstairs, The Fountain will be playing at the local art house rep theatre, on a huge screen lush with golds and greens, surrounded in all directions by inky blackness. I hope I can be their usher.<br /><br />PS As an added bonus, this movie points out that living forever might not be the cup of tea one likes to imagine.<br />Embrace the entropy; it's beautiful too...perhaps even perfect.<br /><br />And besides, maybe this is all just a dream our dog is having.</p></body></html>

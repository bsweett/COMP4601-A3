<meta name="summary" content="4 1/2 stars****....... Damn this flick is violent, and I love it !!!"></head><body><p>This movie I didnt expect to be good when I was see'ing trailers etc and I also stated on my house of 1,000 corpses review it looked stupid and did say my opinion could change, and my whole opinion is changed.<br /><br />This movie was absolutely 100% horror. It's bloody and gory and violent along with tons of foul language, full frontal nudity and did I say violent, every thing a horror should consist of,plus the movie never bores at all.<br /><br /> Its good to see how Zombie with no question in mind pushed this movie to be as insane as he could get it and I cant even imagine if he releases a directors cut. He took a chance and I feel succeeded very very well, going "R" rating is just good to see the man wants to make a horror what a horror should be.<br /><br /> What i like to see is that in this movie you get to learn about the characters  with a ton of dialogue and see'ing what each individual is like. Which is a plus. Also I love a movie where I actually cheer for the villlians as  no matter how much wrong they did I was on there side 100%. For Zombies second movie he did absolutley awesome and give him a ton of props and respect for making this  excellent flick.<br /><br />The make up FX's are great, no CGI ( thank god ), this movie gives the feel of a straight up horror movie from the 70's. And 70's horror is my favorite horror, it shows Zombie knows what real horror is.<br /><br />Everything FX's wise looks real as can be. the end is a complete shocker, will njot spoil anything. But I ill tell you through the wole movie you will beon there side no doubt.<br /><br />He has stars from "Hills have eyes","Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 original ), the slut chick from the " Warriors ",  Terri from " Three's Company" who must be in her 50's and show her bare breasted and damn she is actually still looking hot. And a few more recognizable faces like a wrestler and this spanish guy who when they show him you will know who he is and so on.<br /><br />He had all the right actors for the right parts and he did great. Im looking foward to see'ing what his next flick will be. I know we are done there will be no sequel as Rob Zombie said. Im sure he will make another flick in 2 years or so and will get the funds and I will go see it cause im sure it will be as good as " House of 1,000 Corpses" and " The Devils Rejects" .<br /><br />I own " House of 1,000 Corpses" on DVD and when " The Devils Rejects" comes out will buy it that day no question.<br /><br />This year Rob Zombies film blows Romeros " Land of the Dead" away buy quit a bit. Though Land was good , the devils rejects is just a sick bloody violent gory masterpiece , everything works well and absoluley think was movie was great others might think otherwise but my opinion is my opinion and wont change.</p></body></html>

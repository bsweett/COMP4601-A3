<meta name="summary" content="Upbeat Comedy that Kids and Adults Will Enjoy."></head><body><p>Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a rock guitarist  who has recently been fired by his band. Desperate for cash, he poses as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. But Dewey doesn't know the first thing about teaching, so he's at a loss for anything academic to do. When he learns that many of his 5th-grade students are accomplished musicians, he decides to give these straight-laced kids a lesson in rock-n-roll. He turns the class into a rock band, complete with road crew, a security detail, and groupies. The whole class pitches in to get the band in shape to compete in the city's Battle of the Bands.<p>&quot;School of Rock&quot; was directed by Richard Linklater and written by Mike White, who also plays Dewey's roommate Ned in the film. This movie is just a lot of fun. It was tailor-made for Jack Black, so it perfectly exploits his over-the-top sense of humor and physical comedy. &quot;School of Rock&quot; manages to pay tribute to rock-n-roll while making fun of its more histrionic and self-indulgent clich&eacute;s. It's all in good fun, though. Jack Black is funny and lovable as a reckless rocker who has unwittingly taken on considerable responsibility. Joan Cusack contributes one of her many memorable comedic performances as the uptight principal of the school, Miss Mullins. The child actors who play musicians were themselves chosen for their musical talent. Thankfully the film doesn't fake the kids playing the instruments. They are all accomplished musicians, and it's nice to see so much young talent on the screen. Young members of the audience will be encouraged to see that real kids can rock too. &quot;School of Rock&quot; is a lot of silly fun -but in a good way. It's a movie that both children and adults can enjoy. (By the way, in most parts of the world, this film got a G or PG rating.)<p>The DVD: This is a nicely loaded disc. Bonus features include a making-of documentary called &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;, &quot;Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin&quot; is which he begs the band for permission to use the &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; in the movie, a music video for the film's theme song, &quot;Kid's Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival&quot;, &quot;MTV's Diary of Jack Black&quot;, a DVD-ROM (Windows only) that contains Dewey's History of Rock and an archive of the film's website, 2 audio commentaries, and a theatrical trailer. &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; is a decent documentary, and it features interviews with Jack Black, Mike White, Richard Linklater, and some of the kids. Jack Black fans will like &quot;MTV's Diary of Jack Black&quot;, which spends one day in L.A. with the actor as he goes to rehearsals for the movie and works on new material for Tenacious D. One of the audio commentaries features Jack Black and Richard Linklater. It's entertaining, but there isn't much technical stuff if that 's what you're looking for. The other audio commentary features 7 of the child actors. It's chaotic, but it's interesting to hear the kids' point of view. One of the funniest things is that they've memorized all the punch lines from the movie. If you're interested in the kids, also check out the &quot;Kids Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival&quot;, which follows the principal child actors for about 12 hours on the day of the film's screening at the Film Festival. Subtitles are available, for the film, in English. And dubbing is available in French.</p></body></html>

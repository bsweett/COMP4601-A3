<meta name="summary" content="A look at war from the enemy's perspective"></head><body><p>War is hell,of hat there is no doubt.We tend to malign our enemies maliciously during times of crisis/war.In this instance the Japanese were portrayed as small,bespectacled dirty fighters often referred to as Nips or Japs.The truth was the Japanese were indeed hard soldiers to contend with on the battlefield,stopping at very little to win the tiniest piece of ground,even to the extent of banzai or suicide charges(on the ground-kamikazes in the air).But to propagandize the public and sheer up support for the war machine(very necessary in times such as WW2)these kind of images helped to propel the US and the rest of the allies ever onward to ultimate victory.<br />Underneath the Japanese soldier lay....a human being like anyone else.Their Samurai code and service and discipline structures gave them an attitude which took the Western powers a while to get a handle on.When they finally did they took the fighting to the Japanese in their own style.30,40 years ago,this movie would not have stood much of a chance of getting noticed or being accepted altogether.Memories of those that fought against them were still very much tender.Even today it is still tough for those that fought in such hell holes as Iwo Jima,to accept another or different side to that piece of battlefield history.It was a bold step on Eastwood's part to undertake its making,but undertake it he did and to much acclaim.<br />Letters from Iwo Jima(released in Dec/06) was the second release which dealt with that terrible battle.His first epic was Flags of our Fathers(told from the U.S. perspective),but personally I find this one much more compelling than the first.The story in "Letters" dealt with the small(in comparison)Japanese garrison ordered to hold the island at all costs.We see the day to day life amongst the troops and their struggle to survive on little hope,meager rations and a strict and unbending command structure.In fact what makes this movie work so well is the pall of the little hope this garrison has against the superior forces of the Americans.It is truly a miracle they accomplished and held out as much they did,as long as they did.We see the human but tragic side of the Japanese,a side we the Japanese antagonists have more often than not,just refused to see.Again it is a rational thought process as we,especially the soldiers themselves,would like to try and forget all the horrors that battle,as so many others of WW2,bring to mind.Many others would also say they got as good as good as they gave.Of that I cannot argue.<br />This movie stirs up those and a plethora of other emotions as you watch it,but Eastwood's camera doesn't dwell on any one thing too long.The movie does not take a side,it projects what it was like to be a Japanese soldier during the battle for Iwo Jima,and nothing more.Eastwood,remarkably and successfully,juggles a very controversial topic masterfully.If it had been handled any other way it would have been a disaster.<br />This two disc edition has been transferred beautifully and is clear and crisp in its original widescreen a/r.Extras are abundant and include:A featurette on the making of the movie,a look at the cast members and a clip from the 2006 premiere and press conference in Japan for the movie.<br />A highly recommended DVD for war buffs out there and for everyone else looking for good plain entertainment.The movie takes no sides and Eastwood and company gives a surprisingly accurate portrayal of the life of the Japanese soldier during one of the most bloodiest battles of the Pacific during WW2.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Me Fifth Element . . . Me protect you . . .""></head><body><p>This is an incredibly stylish sci-fi film. There's so much color in this futuristic world, and I don't mean that it's all very in-your-face flashy. It's almost cyberpunk with dashes of colorful modern-day indie styles. I'm not sure if that's put correctly, but I think you get the idea: it almost looks and feels like an anime film. I doubt that major cities will look like the futuristic New York City as seen here, but the designs are nonetheless stunning to look at.<br /><br />Not only did I get a kick at the film's sci-fi style, I was also greatly amused by some of the performances (Oldman and Tucker in particular). Bruce Willis may not be an ideal man for a sci-fi atmosphere, but he does a very god job here. Milla Jovovich is a bit of an annoyance when she first appears, but as the movie continues the annoyance soon vanishes and she gives a very lovely performance as Leeloo (her fight sequence will surely amaze). And by the way, her clothes and her hair look so delicious! Ian Holm never fails: he gives a very believable performance as Vito Cornelius. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, he is more than just a hobbit. Chris Tucker? People may not like his character Ruby Rod, but his loudmothed humor actually adds much to the film. I did find myself laughing at his constant bragging and screaming whenever he's in the face of danger. And finally, the real standout here is the iconic Gary Oldman. This time he uses a very Southern accent for his character Zorg. The entertainment value in The Fifth Element starts to find itself at the very top whenever the man's on screen. "This case is supposed to be FULL!"<br /><br />The music is also worth of mention. Eric Serra has given us a very diverse music score. It's full of keyboards, synthesizers, strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion, and Middle Eastern instruments. Everyone remembers "Lucia di Lammermoor" and "Diva Dance," right? These two sequences in the film are simply the best when it comes to the music.<br /><br />Will this film be forgotten in the future, or become overrated? I doubt it. This is a cult classic, and I don't think it'll ever go away. I just hope it doesn't become a victim of a future remake (!).<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

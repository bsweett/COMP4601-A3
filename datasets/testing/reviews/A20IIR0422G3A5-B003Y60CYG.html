<meta name="summary" content="Great Flick of Radio Show. Weak backstory"></head><body><p>`A Prairie Home Companion', the great American director, Robert Altman's last film, received gushingly approving blurbs on its DVD jacket, but was virtually ignored at all the award shows just past, in spite of a cast which easily outshone (in resume power at least) the talents at other great ensemble casts such as `The Last Picture Show', `The Big Chill', and Altman's own `Gosford Park'. The send-up of the real live `Prairie Home Companion' show was certainly almost flawless in its charm and evocation of author Garrison Keillor's way with his audience, both live and electronic. And, performances by such luminaries as Woody Harrelson, Kevin Kline, John C. Reilly, Meryl Streep, and Lily Tomlin, and Keillor himself seemed flawless.<br /><br />The problem lays, I think, in the plot bracketing the `last performance' of the fictional take on the real live radio show of the same name. This two pronged plot, driven primarily by performances by Virginia Madsen and Tommy Lee Jones, which is based on the premise that the new owners of the theatre and radio station are closing everything down and turning the property into a parking lot. It just seems as if nothing comes of these two roles. They simply drive off together into the night after the `last performance', and nothing changes. The next day, the scenery is struck and the demolition contractors arrive to plant charges to implode the theatre.<br /><br />Fortunately, that plot is done simply as an excuse to broadcast a `Prairie Home Companion' show. The primary screenwriting credits go to Garrison Keillor. One would wish he had shared the effort with someone with a real talent for humorous plots. Woody Allen and Buck Henry immediately come to mind.<br /><br />And yet, there is a great wealth of `moments', most of which come from the interplay between Tomlin and Streep as a sister singing duo, with daughter Lindsey Lohan, who may have done this role to resuscitate her tarnished image as a `bad girl'. Another great pair is the singing duo of Harrelson and Reilly, who manage to do a risqu&eacute; song which may single-handedly be responsible for the shift from PG to PG-13.<br /><br />I have always been a big fan of Kevin Kline, and this role seems to rely on some echos from his Academy Award performance in `A Fish Named Wanda', where the primary attribute of the character is gross ineptitude.<br /><br />If you simply ignore the Madsen / Jones subplot, you are in for a great good time, even if the movie is not Altman's best outing, it is certainly worthy of his classic large cast style.</p></body></html>

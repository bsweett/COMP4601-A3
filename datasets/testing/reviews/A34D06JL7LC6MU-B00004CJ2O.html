<meta name="summary" content="Review for Non-Uncut Version"></head><body><p>It's been 29 years since Friday the 13th hit the screen. 29 years since people first heard the name Jason Voorhees. 29 years is a long time and this film has inspired, in that long time, several sequels, including a 2009 remake. But, does the original horror classic still hold up after 29 years? Surprisingly well actually.<br /><br />Opening at Camp Crystal Lake in 1958, two young camp counselors are brutally murdered. Now, it's Present Day, Friday the 13th of June. Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) is in the process of fixing up Camp Crystal Lake (called Camp Blood by the locals) and a new batch of counselors have arrived. But someone is killing them one-by-one.<br /><br />It's a typical slasher-film setup with the familiar slasher-film stereotypes. There's Ralph, the town-crazy who warns everybody that crosses his path about the dangers of Camp Crystal Lake. Also, there's not a single actor in the film who went on to have a career of any sort, with the exception of a baby-faced Kevin Bacon, playing one of the potential victims.<br /><br />Friday the 13th was such an influential horror film that it's hard to see the originality in it. In the rare case you haven't actually seen it yet, I can guarantee you've seen something pretty damned close to it. Everyone can tell you the "ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma" sound that plays throughout the film.<br /><br />It was surprising to me that this film is still effective. The music, which no one ever seems to mention, is very effective and really eerie. It's a little reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PP8">Psycho (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a>, but it's not your typical, annoying '80s synthesizer score.<br /><br />Also, the idea of using the camera to frame the perspective of the killer wasn't an entirely new idea, but it's used very well here.<br /><br />Finally, despite it having the distinction of being a highly-parodied performance, Betsy Palmer is actually quite frightening in the few scenes she's in. It's not going to make your blood run cold or anything, but it works.<br /><br />Besides introducing the world to one of the most iconic horror film characters of all time, one of the reasons Friday the 13th has held on much longer than other horror films is it's relative lack of carnage. There is quite a bit of blood, certainly but director Sean S. Cunningham utilizes suspense and atmosphere as well in order to terrify his audience. Rest assured blood & gore junkies...There is still enough here to keep you satisfied.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Re-imagined Love Story of Pocahontas Has Amazingly Beautiful Photography with Slow, Frustrating Narrative"></head><body><p>`The New World" is not about debunking of the famous Pocahontas myth Disney took up about ten years ago; it is more about director Terence Malick's attempt to create his own myth about this elusive historical figure. The result is sort of poetic journey to the `New World' with the mesmerizing beauty of the universe it depicts. Still `The New World' remains as elusive as the story of Pocahontas and the film looks sometimes confusing and emotionally detached.<br /><br />The story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith needs no introduction. It is part of the history of America, and Terence Malick tries to present it as accurately as possible. Every scene is shot with the available light. The life in Fort Jamestown is terribly desolate, and there is nothing glorious about the battles between the immigrants and the natives. The film also avoids showing any political messages about this `New World.'<br /><br />But accuracy alone cannot make a film. To tell the story, Terence Malick uses curious method that would divide the opinions among the viewers. That is, the slow-moving film seldom uses dialogues. Instead of that, Malick employs the voiceovers of each character, which reveals his/her heart directly to the audiences, not to another character. I know the intention, and I even admire that, but the results are hardly effective. The spoken language here lacks the emotion while the film is about the emotion about a man - no, two men -- and a woman. These spoken words sound like the unrefined English translation of the old Greek poems. Or maybe that is the point.<br /><br />I don't know Colin Farrell is the first choice of Terence Malick for the role of Captain John Smith. I hear the raving reviews about the acting of him and Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas, but frankly I am not sure. Their acting in the first act, especially that of Q'Orianka Kilcher is simply amazing, using the expressive body language to the full, but in the second half, in which the Captain makes a grave decision, they begin to look less convincing. Why did he do that? How did she accept that? Terence Malick leaves that part to our imagination, but gives no clue with which we can interpret the key scenes.<br /><br />Or did I miss something? I don't know. True, I was absorbed in the lush scenery, the amazingly lively portrait of Pocahontas, and the New World itself. I can still feel the beauty of it after leaving the theater. At the same time, I think the beauty of the paradise and its innocence does not need the sprawling 135 minutes and the unfocused narrative. `The New World' is like watching a great painting in museum; some can do it for hours, and even love it, but others prefer something different.</p></body></html>

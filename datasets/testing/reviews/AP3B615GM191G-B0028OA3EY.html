From the time that I was a child, I sat captivated by various Superman incarnations (most notably the first two Christopher Reeve movies), then got into the "Supes" spirit again when Smallville hit the airwaves on television.  When I saw this movie in the theater on its premiere night in 2006, I thought it was absolutely incredible.  With a bit of reflection, however, it is clear that "Superman Returns" is little more than wasted potential.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Superman Returns" sees the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh) returning to Earth from a long hiatus of searching for the remains of his home planet Krypton.  Upon his return to Earth and re-entry into the Clark Kent persona, he notices some major changes afoot.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is now married (husband played by James Marsden) and has a son (Tristan LeBeau), as well as a Pulitzer Prize for the article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman".  One thing that hasn't changed, however, is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) being up to his old nefarious deeds.<br /><br />I could prattle on and on about why this is a sub-par movie, but that dialogue can be summed up in two key bullet points:<br /><br />-First, is the utterly inconsistent plot/storyline.  Though director Bryan Singer wants us (the viewers) to believe that the world has "moved on" from Superman, it is as if nothing has changed whatsoever.  Clark still gets a job at the Daily Planet, all the characters act/look the same, and even the typical "Supes vs. Lex" rivalry is renewed with little to nothing new interjected.  The only addition?  A potential child figure in the life of the returning hero.  Without giving away any major spoilers, this is a TERRIBLE addition to the movie and only serves to complicated things more (as opposed to adding any real emotion).<br /><br />-Secondly, the writing/dialogue is atrocious.  Spacey is not a good Lex Luthor (though whether by casting or given dialogue I am not entirely sure), Bosworth is a middling Lois, and Routh can only channel Reeve (again, a failure to "move on" in the storyline).  The two actors who really stand out are Frank Langella (playing Perry White) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), and even they are not on screen all that much.<br /><br />Simply put, "Superman Returns" is a movie for its time...and nothing more.  It was made to capitalize on the burgeoning success of Smallville, which had thrust "Superman mania" back into popular culture once again.  Singer does an okay job of playing to those who just wanted to see the suit, cape, Reeve impersonation, and flying scenes, but other than that he turns in an utter stinker.<br /><br />Ironically, while the cannon established in this effort wipes the events of Superman III & IV off the map, "Superman Returns" will likely not ever be considered cannon in its own right.  For rabid Superman fans, this is frustrating considering the massive potential that could have evolved from a truly great film at that time.<br /><br />The final verdict: Unless you care about nothing else but the visuals, this will be a severe disappointment.  You'll want to love it, but it doesn't ever give you a chance.</p></body></html>

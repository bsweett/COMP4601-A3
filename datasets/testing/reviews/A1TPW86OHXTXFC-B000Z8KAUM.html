I know people highly invested in my survival, and they are people who really know how to hurt in ways you can't even imagine.<br />Danny Ocean: Well, I know all the guys that you'd hire to come after me, and they like me better than you. " IDMB<br /><br />Danny Ocean, George Clooney, trying to play Dean Martin's part and Brad Pitt playing Sinatra- somehow it doesn't come off. Damon after Ellen Barkin- didn't work. Barkin is too smart and tough to play a woman overcome with lust from a spray.  The movie did not work for me. Lots of high technology was of interest, but after awhile it gets old. The storyline, trying to win back what was once a bird in the hand.<br /><br />Willie Banks played by Al Pacino who took the hotel literally from the Oceans' 13 friend, Reuben Tishkoff, played by Elliot Gould. OK, that is the plot and the storyline.  The rest of the thirteen act as back-ups and set the wheels in motion. We all know from the get go how this story is going to play out. Suspense, there is none.  Acting, it seems that most everyone glides through their roles with ease- a few non-sequiturs thrown in.  Brad Pitt surprises Danny Ocean (Clooney) watching Oprah with a tear  in his eye. Are we really supposed to believe this? These tough guys with tears in their eyes?<br /><br />"Some wisecracking critic will no doubt smirk that what was filmed in Vegas should have stayed in Vegas. But another one of those Soderbergh rules to live by is that everything "Oceans" is done for fun. If you're not having a good time, cash in your chips and walk away. Don't whine to management, and don't expect to be comped." Michael Booth<br /><br />Took all I had to get through this film. Thought it might get better- sorrowfully no.<br /><br />Recommended for the star power, only.  prisrob 12-03-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W9DTG6">Ocean's Trilogy (Ocean's Eleven / Ocean's Twelve / Ocean's Thirteen)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1NXJ0">Good Night, and Good Luck (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

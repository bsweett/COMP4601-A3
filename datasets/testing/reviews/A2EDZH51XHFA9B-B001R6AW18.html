Schoedsack, 1933)<br /><br />When I was a kid, I obsessed over monster movies. (Well, didn't we all?) I was eight when the 1976 remake of King Kong came out, and I saw it innumerable times on the Saturday afternoon creature feature over the years. But somehow, despite seeing clips from it thousands of times and having seen enough stills of it in monster-movies books and magazines when I was just a little squid, I somehow managed to never see the original version entire. I remedied that error last week. King Kong is one of those movies that constantly makes thousand-best lists (of all those I've compiled, only Jonathan Rosenbaum's leaves it off), but while I was watching it, I had to wonder: did it make the lists because of what it was in 1933, or because it holds up well today? Ideally, a truly classic film should be a mix of both (Murnau's Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie des Grauens is a perfect example; at the time, it was revolutionary, with Murnau inventing new ways to film tracking shots and the like, while it still packs a creepy punch almost a century later just because it's a damned good movie); while there's no doubt that King Kong was revolutionary for its time, and did a great deal to advance the wonderful world of movie special effects, it was made at a time when silent film was still a credible option, and the expressionism inherent in silent film hadn't quite cleared off yet. And when I look at it like that, I realize just how modern it was, for its time; so many of the players in this movie give perfectly creditable performances. But the one who seems like a holdover from the silent film days where her acting is concerned is incapable of being ignored-- the movie's star, Fay Wray. Now, I grant you, she's supposed to be playing someone who's acting in a silent film, so had she kept the overacting for when she was in front of Robert Armstrong's cameras, well, that would have been all well and good. But even while everyone around her is acting in a more modern fashion, Wray is all about the overacting. It tends to get annoying.<br /><br />That said, the movie is exceptionally well-made (especially given Cooper and Schoedsack's previous collaboration, the somewhat anemic The Most Dangerous Game, made on a basement budget using the sets and actors, for the most part, the two were using for King Kong); the script is well-plotted and well-paced, much of the acting is at or above par for the time (Wray has already been noted; Victor Wong, who portrays Charlie the cook, plays his role well, but is so hopelessly stereotyped we never get to see what he's really made of), and of course the special effects were marvelous for the time. It is certainly still a watchable movie, and an enjoyable one. And maybe that's enough. ****</p></body></html>

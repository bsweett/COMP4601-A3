The first Evil Dead was a straight forward horror movie that was loaded with gore galore.  Evil Dead 2 is really a remake of the original with better effects, better acting, and somewhat better story.  There isn't as much gore as there is in the original, but the blood flows and flies everywhere, sometimes with hilarious results.  When Ash's hand takes a mind of its' own is one of the funniest segments I've ever seen in a movie, and naturally Bruce Campbell is perfect as the hapless hero.  Do yourself a favor, even if you don't like horror movies pick up the entire Evil Dead trilogy, you'll be laughing out loud while you cringe in disgust.  Also highly recommended is Bad Taste.</p></body></html>

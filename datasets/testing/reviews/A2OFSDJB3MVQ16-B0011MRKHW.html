<meta name="summary" content="Elizabeth-the Golden Age?"></head><body><p>I looked forward to seeing this sequel to the 1998 release but somehow despite the great production values and Cate Blanchett's great performance in the lead role, I was disappointed. Most of the problem concerns the script which seems to lack focus.  First we are treated to Elizabeth's problems with Mary Stuart, then her relationshop with Walter Raleigh (an excellent Clive Owen) and then the struggle with Prince Phillip of Spain to maintain diplomacy which culminates in war. In comparison to the original, there was a distinct point of view but in this sequel, everything is scattered with a lack of focus. The 3 stars I give this to are the superb HD DVD transfer, Blanchette's performance and of course the battle scenes.  This is disc you would need to show off the virtues of HI-DEF!! If you like this type of history, do check it out but there are better films on this subject such as "Elizabeth and Essex" and "The Virgin Queen".</p></body></html>

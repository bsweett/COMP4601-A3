It's such a beautiful movie with a great storyline and great acting.  No wonder it was nominated for some Oscars.  It's a terrific heart-warming movie that is fun to watch again and again.  Well acted by Juliette Binoche (nominated for an Oscar for this performance) and other cast members, I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to see a beautiful story with no violence, sex, guns for a change.  It's set in a beautiful country town in France and the scenery is lovely.  I love the touches of humour it has throughout and again; I really recommend this to everyone.  It also stars the amazing Judy Dench.</p></body></html>

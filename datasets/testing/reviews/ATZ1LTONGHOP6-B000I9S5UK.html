<meta name="summary" content="The original was great, but the remake is even better"></head><body><p>On New Year's Eve, the few remaining police officers at a police precinct that is set to close the next day, and their prisoners, find themselves cut off from the outside world and under siege. Their attackers outnumber them considerably and will not stop until everyone inside the precinct is dead.<br /><br />I am probably committing a sacrilege by saying this, but even though the original John Carpenter version of "Assault on Precinct 13" is a really great film, the remake is even better. Screenwriter James DeMonaco has taken Carpenter's original idea, kept all of the things that worked and fixed all of the things that didn't. For example, in the original film, the people attacking the precinct were essentially zombies: they never spoke; they had no personality; and they kept on coming at the precinct with no fear of death and with only the flimsiest of motives. In the remake, the attackers are humanized (in the form of Gabriel Byrne) and given a motive that is strong enough to make me believe that they would lay siege on a police precinct and keep going to the death. DeMonaco also gives more humanity to the people inside the precinct. These people, particularly Sgt Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) and gangster Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburn), are real people with real flaws, whereas in the original, I always felt that criminal Napoleon Wilson (Marion Bishop's counterpart) was a bit too honourable to be a gangster. These changes made this film a lot more satisfying for me and convinced me that this is the better of the two films. Having said that, the original is also thoroughly worth watching and I recommend that anyone who is interested in seeing this film see both versions, back to back, and make up their own mind about which is the better of the two.</p></body></html>

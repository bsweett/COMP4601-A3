<meta name="summary" content=""Insomnia" Keeps You Awake!"></head><body><p>"Insomnia" is an at times confusing puzzle by the same person who created the cult hit\ and perhaps even classic(?) film "Memento", Christopher Nolan.<br /> "Insomnia" is a remake of an 1998 Norwegian film directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg, and it's one of the few times we can say a remake actually works! This new version of "Insomnia" is so grandly conceieved, so richly constructed that I'm afraid American audiences won't like it. "Insomnia" is not some by the numbers, fast-paced, loud summer movie, that perhaps some people might think it will turn out to be, no, this movie is a well thought out character study about what happens when we make the wrong choices to protect ourselves. Director, Nolan is more concerned here with the story and character development then loud car chasing scenes, or big explosions. Nolan and screenwriter Hillary Seitz have actually taken the time out to tell us a story. They pace the film wonderfully and allow us to get to know the characters. There is more to a film like "Insomnia" than meets the eye. But, even so, like I said, I'm afraid the American public won't go for it. The American public likes fast, cliche, pointless, mindless movies. They like to see people run away from dinosaurs or people under attack by a group of aliens. I know for a fact people will say that this movie is slow and boring. And that it doesn't go anywhere. People will say this film is not a good follow-up to "Memento". But, they are wrong. They just have no patience.<br /> The plot for "Insomnia" goes something like this; Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are two L.A. cops sent to Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. Once they arrive they are greeted by Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) who is a by the books, young cop. She's the cliche character who became a cop because she loves it. She thinks that there's no corruption inside the system. As the film goes on, we find out that it's not merely because Dormer (Pacino) and Eckhart (Donovan) are good cops that they have been sent to investigate this case. They were both in trouble in L.A. for some questionable actions on their last case. This is there way of taking the "heat" off them. As the film goes on we find out that the killer was\is a "twisted" person. He actually took the time out to wash the girl's hair, to paint her nails, and even clip them! It was not just a random act of violence, but a premeditated one. I don't really want to give much more information then I already have, you just have to go see the film yourself to find out the rest. All I will say is the film has a lot of "tricks" up it's sleeve, so don't think you'll be able to see through the plot.<br /> So, some of you are probably wondering, how is this different from the original, well, there are small differences. Like the whole background story with the lead character's being sent on the case. The relationship between the two cops is different. And, the female character in this one doesn't seem as strong. Also, there are some brief scenes of sexual content. Which does not appear in this new version.<br /> "Insomnia" is one of the year's best films, it has a truly remarkable performance by Al Pacino. So far, it's the best performance of the year! Pacino proves himself to be one of the greatest actor we have around today. Robin Williams is oddly, very good in this film. I use the word oddly because I sometimes find it hard for me to see him in serious roles. I mean, this is the same man who use to play a space alien on "Mork & Mindy". But, Williams gives his best performance since "Good Will Hunting". Hilary Swank gives a good performance as well, but, for me, it wasn't anything really special, though, I don't think that was her fault, I think it was just the way the part was written.<br /> Bottom-Line: "Insomnia" is an extremely well constructed character study\thriller. The pacing of the film is wonderful and the performances are even better. Truly one of the year's best films!</p></body></html>

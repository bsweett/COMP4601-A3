<meta name="summary" content="Open &quot;House&quot;"></head><body><p>Powerhouse film, starring Jennifer Connelly, Ben Kingsley, and Ron Eldard, that has enough twists and turns with a sudden tragic ending that will leave the intelligent viewer stunned.<p>  Connelly is a young women freshly evicted from her home due to a property tax payment mix up. Due to this mix up, the town puts the house up for sale and is quickly bought by an Iranian family, led by Kingsley. Connelly fights to get the house back but Kingsley isn't easily swayed, especially after he builds a roof deck addition to the house that overlooks the ocean. Whats worse, he also gets the house appraised, making the house three times more valuable than what it once was without the improvements. Connelly continues her fight and gets support from the sheriff (Eldard) who evicted her (they have a major league affair). The events afterwards are quite stunning as all involved spiral downward in a pit of mixed emotions. <p>  The performances are outstanding. Kingsley is one of the best and possibly most underated actors out there today. Connelly gives one of her best roles to date. Eldard takes a break from his so-so comedic roles and is great as the confused sheriff who gets in way over his head. One of the best films from 2003, this &quot;House&quot; won't leave you in the fog.</p></body></html>

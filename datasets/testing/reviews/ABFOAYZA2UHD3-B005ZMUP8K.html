Maybe the One was better in terms of story, but there is nothing wrong with the Two (cept length, boy there WAS room to cut it shorter). Cast eqally as amazin in both. Depp hilarious!!<br /><br />Went "uh-oh, there's gonna be a Three" when I saw the ending. It does not end, it goes "to be continued". Hope we don't have to wait too long.</p></body></html>

When a fugitive thief blunders into her life, opportunity presents itself and adventure and romance follow.<br /><br />Disney's 50th animated film features beautiful animation, wonderful character design, excellent voice talent, and some terrific songs, but the script lets it down.  It lacks wit, relying too much on the other aspects of production to do the heavy lifting.  As a result, the familiar tropes of a Disney Princess film, such as the young woman with animal friends waiting for her life to begin, seem mechanical and unimaginative, as do the thugs with hearts of gold.  There are also too many moments when the screenwriter seems to have written himself into a corner and must rely on coincidence and unlikely meetings to get out of it.  However, the film's other strengths make it enjoyable and it does have some great moments.</p></body></html>

The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end and I was left with the same creeped-out feeling I had for Mothman Prophecies (which to this day, no matter how many times I watch that one, it freaks me out). In my book, that's excellent, although I would not recommend watching this alone at night. Or at least not alone period. The movie was very well done and captivating. My best friend and I absolutely enjoyed this Exorcism. It ropes you in from the beginning with a riveting tale based on a true story. It's something I will no doubt watch again and again, though only in the company of friends who don't mind helping me check my closets before they go home. If you like this genre, you will definitely enjoy watching this.</p></body></html>

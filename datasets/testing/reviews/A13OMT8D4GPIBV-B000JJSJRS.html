<meta name="summary" content="A Good Following Up..."></head><body><p>This is not the first movie.  All the feeling of the first movie can't be recreated.  Though Stephen Sommers and his returning players try.  But this is still pretty fun.  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Oded Fehr, Arnold Vosloo, and John Hannah return for the sequel, which is a plus given the state of sequels theses days.  Although they can't recreate the magic of the first they give it a really good try.<br /><br />The second movie also features the on screen debut of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and it's a good debut.<br /><br />The DVD features more of the same from the first movie, it has a commentary, making of features, and other special features, including an interview with The Rock.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

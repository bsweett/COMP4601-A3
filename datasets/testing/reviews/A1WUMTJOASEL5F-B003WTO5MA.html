It doesnt matter how stressed out he is, or becomes, the camera wants hunk in this spooky shadow of a well worn story of a family taken residence in a possessed and haunted house. From the reading of other reviewers the first movie still has bad karma. Ha, ha. Well, I liked the first movie not because of its execution (sorry) in style, but by some really memorable scenes that just creeped up on you that this movie doesnt have. Like the ill begotten nun who came to visit, or the psychic woman who immediately felt an outside presence of evil from within. These are the moments good movies make because they are lasting impressions of horror in any true good horror movie. Even the trivial encounter with a dragon statue and loss of money made the first one memorable which, by the way, this movie doesnt have.<br />What it does have is a well stressed family, and Ryan losing his grip with reality. The visuals and incorporated spooks are the results of more formulated horror movies of recent years. So in the midst of Hellraiser, Saw, and the like, this movie should please. If not, than munch your popcorn to Ryan's wonderful bod and puppy dog lost eyes in this haunted visual nightmare.</p></body></html>

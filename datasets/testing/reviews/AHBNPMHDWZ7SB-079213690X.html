He just happens to do it more oftne than others. Okay, maybe I'm making excuses for him, but that doesn't change the most important fact that Braveheart is everything its title promises. It's brave, and it has heart. I bought this movie as a blind buy, hoping it would fill the void that Ridley Scott's Robin Hood left in my soul, or heart, or wherever people say that void is. Anyway, I also went in expecting Mel Gibson to completely butcher his accent. I'm happy to say that I was surprised on both front. Mel Gibson was amazing as William Wallace, the famous Scotsman who lead his people to fight in a bloody revolution against the King of England who unfairly took over his land around the early 13th Century. I won't pretend to know a thing about history, beyond the propaganda I was taught in school growing up. So, I went into this with a blank slate.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm quite interested in learning a bit more about Wallace and the events that the film are based on. Mel Gibson also directed Braveheart, for which I believe he won the Oscar for Best Director, along with the film winning Best Picture, Best Cinematography (and rightfully so, because it was gorgeous, especially in high def), Best Sound Editing and Best Makeup. That epic blue battle makeup will forever be burned into my memory whenever I hear Mel's name. I really enjoyed the epicness of the film. Large scale, gruesome battles always help me sleep soundly. The love story that motivated Wallace to go on his freedom "rampage", I'll call it because he basically slaughters hundreds of men for a woman. Reminds me of Wolverine, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />As far as the Blu-ray transfer goes, it's certainly a gorgeous one. The picture quality is amazingly clear, and accurate to its source. Paramount's Sapphire Series rarely delivers anything less, and when it does, they tend to respond to fan outcry (see the Gladiator reissue). Colors and textures are perfectly presented. The audio is top noth as well, very atmospheric. When I say it's atmospheric I mean that the sharp contrasts between epic battles on the hilsides and in villages, and the quiet subtle moments of dialogue is ever apparent when listening to the lostless soundtrack on this disc. Both the picture and audio quality do their parts in adding to the immersive effect this film has. Beneath its rugged masculine hetero manliness, there's a beautiful delicate tale to be heard. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

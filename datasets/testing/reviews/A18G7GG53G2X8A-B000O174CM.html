We have writer/director Bill Condon--who penned the screenplay to 2002's "Chicago"--to thank for this adaptation of the original Broadway musical. Here's a film that's truly alive, with vibrant colors, energetic, soulful music, and singing voices that definitely do justice to the material. I can't say whether or not these qualities will result in a successful movie; over the past a couple of years, a number of well-made musical films were overlooked or flatly rejected ("The Phantom of the Opera," "Rent," and "The Producers" come to mind). Here's hoping for some recognition.<br /><br />I say this because, within the scope of the narrative, "Dreamgirls" is a winner, from the very first frame to the last. Never once did it seem as if something was lacking or improperly handled; everything felt absolutely right. There are a number of possible factors: good casting; decent script; a simple yet significant story; a gathering of exciting, show stopping musical numbers. This film has it all, and it's sure to completely satisfy those in need of Broadway experience outside of Broadway. I'm afraid I can't say how faithful this film adaptation is to the original play, nor can I speculate on how accurately it portrays the real life story of The Supremes. What I can say is that this film is able to stand on its own, and making comparisons to different material is unnecessary.<br /><br />The basic plot is about three singers and their whirlwind journey through music superstardom. Beginning in mid-1960s Detroit, Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), and Effie Melody White (Jennifer Hudson) are part of a struggling girl band called The Dreamettes. They're about ready to give up because they've been together a number of years without having gotten a break. But then they meet Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a smooth talking music producer/used car salesman (which already should be indicative of an interesting journey). He offers them the chance to sing backup for James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy), both locally and while he's on tour. Naturally, the girls accept (although Effie needed a little more convincing than the other two).<br /><br />Meeting Early is like hitting a brick wall, for both the girls and the audience. He's not charming, but he sure is magnetic, a trait that barely surpasses his wild onstage persona and offstage arrogance. Even his manager, Marty Madison (Danny Glover), isn't in a position of control; Early will only do what he wants to do. I got the sense that Murphy put everything he had into this role, which is good because it resulted in one of his best, most memorable performances. The same can be said for Knowles, who at last has been given the chance to show some acting talent (which couldn't have been said for films like "Austin Powers in Goldmember" or "The Pink Panther"). She gives Deena a sweet yet determined demeanor, fueled by the desire to sing. Her desire only gets stronger as the national tour becomes successful and recording offers are made.<br /><br />Deena and Lorrell begin the film as backup singers for Effie, who clearly has the more dominant voice (and Jennifer Hudson certainly lets us know this; just try to keep your hands apart after her renditions of "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going" and "Love You I Do"). But as the three drift apart from Early and begin their own act, Taylor insists that Deena become the lead singer. Understandably, Effie isn't happy about this. Thus begins the first of many ups and downs the girls will have to endure, not helped by the fact that Effie and Taylor are romantically involved. Everyone begins to feel as if Effie is too demanding, too outspoken, and too inflexible for the good of the group. After much offstage squabbling, she's unceremoniously replaced by Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal).<br /><br />The story then stretches out for about eight years, bringing the story into the 1970s. Many things happen during that time, both good and bad: Deena and Taylor get married; Lorrell and Early continue a love affair; many new albums are recorded; Deena is signed on to play Cleopatra; and Effie struggles to revive her career, a situation made worse by the fact that she's now a single mother. We also witness the growing tension between Taylor and songwriter Clarence Conrad "C.C." White (Keith Robinson), Effie's brother. For years, C.C.'s songs--sung by Early and The Dreams--were subject to heavy revisions, both in terms of the music and lyrics. From Taylor's point of view, it's strictly a matter of business; songs have to be a certain way if they're to make an album sell. But from C.C.'s point of view, the integrity of his work is suffering. None of this is helped by the fact that he and Effie haven't spoken in a couple of years (C.C. supported the rest of the group instead of her).<br /><br />All the human drama prevents the film from losing itself; it's not too bright and bubbly, but it's not too melodramatic, either. This very easily could have turned into a hollow story, something that was all glitz but no substance. A real story is being told here, one that would work even if it weren't told in the language of song. I also appreciated how it plausibly portrays the roller coaster ride that fame is; we're not spared the reality that celebrities can crash and burn much more easily than they can climb to the top. Such ingredients made for one of the year's most entertaining films, one that ends just as strongly as it begins. I can't say whether or not everything turns out okay for The Dreams (assuming you've never seen the play), but I guarantee you that finding out will be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining and Surprisingly Compelling Action Film"></head><body><p>Jon Favreau (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADFY">Swingers </a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE">Elf</a>) effectively directs the screen adaptation for the comic book superhero Iron Man.  Favreau has some fine-tuning ahead of him in terms of directing action films but Iron Man is still among the very best comic book character based films so far.  It is about as entertaining as you can get and the few flaws that are present are almost entirely forgivable due to Favreau's knack for developing characters and also understating drama effectively.  It might be important to note that it is hard to contain myself and write an honest review, because in all of my years of reading comics, Iron Man, along with perhaps the Silver Surfer, is my favorite comic book character of them all.  Fortunately for me, unlike last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMPW">Fantastic Four sequel</a>, this particular film truly delivers in terms of satisfying the little long lost comic book geek-boy dwelling in my brain.  There were actually moments during the film that I looked over to my brother in full wide-eyed geek-mode and said things like "that stands for S.H.I.E.L.D.!"  The kid in me absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />Iron Man, for the uninitiated, is really Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Chief Executive Officer of weapons manufacturing giant Stark Industries (think Lockheed Martin run by Donald Trump).  He is an arrogant womanizing alcoholic who just happens to be an MIT graduate and a technical genius unlike no other man of his time.  It is as if Leonardo Da Vinci was sent into a time machine, given a mansion, several bottles Johnny Walker Blue, and no reason not to celebrate his lust for women.  In other words, this is not Superman.  Stark is flawed and Favreau so graciously provides us an opportunity to watch him grow as a man and as a machine in his ever-evolving nearly indestructible self-made super armor.  In the beginning, Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and unbeknownst to his enemies, he is shown the error of his ways as a weapons manufacturer and begins building his suit as a way to escape his kidnappers.  A new man with new motives, Stark develops his suit further and becomes an unlikely but befitting hero.  Look out terrorists and look weapons manufacturers, including you Iron Monger!  I only wish he could've cleaned up that ugliness in Iraq on his way home.<br /><br />One can tell by the promotions that the special effects are great and they are amazing from beginning to end.  However, the screenplay is very solid, especially the humorous, fast, and witty dialogue for Robert Downey, Jr.  The chemistry between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) works remarkably well and far better than I would've expected.  Jeff Bridges is also great as the villain Obidiah Stane and the rest of the cast is solid all around, with the exception of perhaps Terrence Howard he unfortunately seems to be going through the motions here.  But overall, the magic of this film is the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role.  He is perfect for the role in almost every way.  Somehow he gives us a hero we feel compelled to find a reason to root for despite his flaws.  I'm not sure another actor could've pulled it off.<br /><br />This definitely receives a high recommendation from me for pretty much anyone looking for a fun and compelling action movie.  For fellow lovers of the Iron Man comics and other crossover stories (i.e. Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D.); do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are done rolling, you won't regret it.</p></body></html>

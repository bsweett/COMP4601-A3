<meta name="summary" content="A mesmerizing thriller with Tom Cruise at his absolute best!"></head><body><p>About a couple of weeks ago, I went to check out "Collateral" at the theater. The film was nothing short of action-packed and intense! The direction of Michael Mann ("Heat", "The Insider") was top-notch and outstanding! With its meditative aerial views of downtown street grids and rich digital-video cinematography that unites sparkle and grime into a kind of seedy nocturnal poetry, "Collateral" is one of the best-looking modern noirs that you'll see. It could be a corollary to another modern noir and Mann's best film, the epic crime story "Heat" -- a more modest, more arty riff on L.A.'s underside and on the juxtaposition of straight and criminal leads. The performance of Tom Cruise ("The Last Samurai"), offering a change of pace for his role as a ruthless killer, was nothing short of intense! It's impossible to take your eyes off of Cruise for a second! The performance of Jamie Foxx ("Any Given Sunday") was nothing short of excellent! Joining them are Jada Pinkett Smith (The "Matrix" films), Mark Ruffalo ("13 Going on 30"), Peter Berg ("Cop Land"), and Bruce McGill ("Runaway Jury") in which they gave great performances as well.<br /><br />The film pairs a fast-talking, hired assassin named Vincent (Cruise) in town for one night with a cabbie named Max (Foxx) on the night shift. Vincent arrives in the city late with orders to knock off five people involved in a drug-trafficking trial set to start the next morning. After being impressed with Max's knowledge of L.A. shortcuts and traffic patterns en route to his first hit, Vincent hires Max to be his driver for the night, securing his services first with a handful of hundred dollar bills and later, when Max knows what Vincent is up to, through threat of violence.<br /><br />As the cabbie, Jamie Foxx continues his perhaps unlikely rise from sitcom celeb to A-list actor, though it's easy to imagine dozens of other actors inhabiting the same role just as well. Appealing supporting players Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are fine, if perhaps underused. But the real attraction here is Tom Cruise, and for a director who has worked with such high-wattage actors as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Russell Crowe, Daniel Day-Lewis, and even William Petersen (who gave an intense, moody performance in Mann's 1986 film, "Manhunter", the superior precursor to "The Silence of the Lambs"), Cruise seems a little too plain -- a little too dull -- for a Mann protagonist. But clearly, Cruise's own image is at work here, with Mann playing off Cruise's unflappable persona and trying to get dramatic mileage by having the actor play against type as a ruthless bad guy. (A scene in a jazz club is a set piece to show off the depths of Vincent's heartlessness and Cruise's bravery.) Cruise's Vincent certainly makes for a compelling visual, his silver hair and gray stubble matching his shiny, shark-colored suit to form the image of a hit man as walking handgun. Cruise is as watchable as ever, but his Vincent is too much the cipher. His line readings are so practice-perfect that Vincent could be as easily be a Cruise hero from any of the actor's other action movies.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Collateral" has the makings of a gritty, action-packed thriller with suspense at every twist and turn. Under the direction of an industry hack like Joel Schumacher or Brett Ratner, "Collateral" might have ranged from unwatchable to instantly forgettable. But luckily for us, Michael Mann gives it enough soul and visual verve to make it worth seeing, which is a not-inconsiderable feat. But ultimately, "Collateral" might be just another Hollywood star vehicle. Without a doubt, "Collateral" is a DVD must-own for your collection!</p></body></html>

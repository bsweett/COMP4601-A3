The storyline focuses around the blonde-haired woman played by Kristen Wiig who stars is many adventures, or rather, MISadventures, haha.  She meets a cop and they fall in love but... well, I wouldn't be so quick to call this "love".  More like the cop falls for her but she's too afraid to make an impression when the relationship tries to take a serious turn.  That's one of many elements to this puzzling relationship.<br /><br />SEVERAL of the laughs come when Kristen's character meets up with all her friends and they unintentionally find themselves caught in situations where things go horribly wrong.  To give a few examples, in one scene they all go out to eat together at a restaurant and afterwards while shopping for wedding clothes, they become violently sick.  This leads to a scene that's best not to spoil not only for the surprise factor, but for the appropriateness of the matter, haha.  You'll CERTAINLY know what I mean when you see how disgusting this particular bathroom segment is!  Another hilarious segment comes during the plane ride when the blonde woman takes drugs and gives the steward and stewardess a hard time.  I like this plane segment in particular for the many layers of depth between ALL the characters.  Many of these jokes qualify as humor done in a subtle way, but it works beautifully.<br /><br />The storyline is SO well-written in fact, that it manages to keep your attention the entire way through.  The writers did a good job coming up with a script that both men and women can enjoy together, however I do believe some of the jokes are a little too offensive for women (such as one scene where a woman explains how dirty boys become when they reach their teenage years- she doesn't hold anything back).<br /><br />Other than that, expect a quality storyline, lots of laughs, and well, how can we forget the one woman of the bunch who's rock solid both physically and attitude-wise?  She's actually tied with Kristen Wiig's character for most exciting actress of the group.  All the characters in the film end up fitting the role perfectly as the story unravels.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

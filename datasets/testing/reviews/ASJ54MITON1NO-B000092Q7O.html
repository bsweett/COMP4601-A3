In other words we see exactly what the character had to go through in order to survive, and it truly is an amazing story. Similar to Polanski's own story, of survival in Poland during the Nazi Occupation during World War II. Also, noteworthy is the cinematic elements used to tell the story, such as expressive, but realistic use of camera, lighting, color and sound. Not to mention the acting, which is obviously top-notch.</p></body></html>

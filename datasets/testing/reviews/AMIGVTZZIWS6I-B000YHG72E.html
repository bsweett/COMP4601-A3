<meta name="summary" content="Great Family Film"></head><body><p>There's somethnig about Will Ferrell.  About the way a man nearly 40-years-old can display such a child-like innocense without it being cloying and condescending.  Don't get me wrong, there are points in this movie when it is so sickly sweet that you just have to roll your eyes.  But it has such a great message about Christmas, about family, about diversity, about what is really important in life that you can overlook the sickly sweet moments and enjoy the film.  Ferrell is at his best when he is playing these innocent misfits.  Best of all, this is a film the entire family can sit down and watch.  A few bad words may be in there, but they are so fleeting that I can't even remember what they were.  This is a very enjoyable holiday film with some great moments and a lot of child-like humor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A remarkable piece of cinema"></head><body><p>I truly enjoyed this movie.  Although I will warn you that if you want traditional romance, comedy, and drama, then this film is not for you.  After all it is made by Focus Features, and was written by Charlie Kauffman.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a quirky comedy/drama.  Jim Carrey is amazing as the understated, and at times, dull Joel.  Kate Winslet is perfection as the outspoken, trying-so-hard-to-impress-you freak girl Clementine.  They meet and have a wonderful relationship, but like so many others, they fall apart.<br /><br />In the quirkiest of turns, Joel finds out Clementine has had him erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same.  And this is where the action and emotion begin.  While remembering all the pain and anguish this love affair caused him, he also realizes that those emotions pale in comparison to the love and affection they also shared (but have apparently forgotten about).<br /><br />This movie has a truly stunning ending that makes me cry with happiness.  The story is so brutally honest that anyone who has ever loved and lost should feel some sort of connection to these characters and their plight.<br /><br />I love this movie, and it will continue to be one of my favorites for all time.  Highly recommended!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Such a classic!  One of my favorites!"></head><body><p>I came to know of Harrison Ford because of his Indiana Jones sequels, &amp; I guess, these paved the way for his stardom, after being starred in  Star Wars.  We all know the story of these three movies &amp; they're just  simply great!  A lot of action...too much excitement..&amp; a happy  ending.<p>A lot of other movies were patterned after the Indiana series,  but none of them ever came close.  These will always be in my favorite list  of movies :-)</p></body></html>

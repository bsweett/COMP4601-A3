<meta name="summary" content="Yuck....Raiders came with it! (lol)"></head><body><p>Well, my reviews of the last two Indy movies still stand, but I STILL don't like "Raiders of the Lost Ark", now retitled "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark". Whoopee. Besides James Bond, Indy has to be the most imitated movie hero since Tarzan, but I can assure you, "Raiders" is NOT the movie that spurred the land office business in fedoras, short leather jackets and that spate of Indy-type TV shows in the mid-eighties...it was probably "Temple of Doom" that set it off. "Raiders" is still, to me, empty, stupid, cliched and tailor made for a non-discriminating mass audience, like Spielberg's other movies of that era. I don't know....I always liked the movies he's PRODUCED, directed by others, more than his own movies....HIS movies are like that old joke about Chinese food...you're always a hungry ten minutes later, like they're missing something....big time! "E.T.", "Close Encounters", "Raiders" and "Jurassic Park" have always struck me that way, and "Bruce" in "Jaws" always looked SOOOOOO fake, (and the movie wasn't the LEAST bit scary, either!) I've always felt burned after seeing a Spielberg movie! This is why I say it's obvious that Lucas and possibly Kauffman have both had substantially extensive involvement in the latter two movies, which were much more enjoyable than the first.<br /><br />It's not easy being a completist, lemme tell ya! ;-)</p></body></html>

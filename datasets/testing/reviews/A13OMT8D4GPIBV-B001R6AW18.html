Even after Peter Jackson created his interpretation of Kong, King Kong (1933) still lives on.  The movie was first remade in 1976 but the first still remains the best.  Definitely one to see.<br /><br />The DVD comtains a commentary, a few featurettes and a deleted sequence.  Definitely one to pick up.</p></body></html>

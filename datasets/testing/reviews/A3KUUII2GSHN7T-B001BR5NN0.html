This is the cornerstone of all eighties movies, fresh with its witty humor, solid message, and fine collection of young eighties stars.  <p>It is the story of five kids, five very different kids and the day they were forced to spend together in Saturday detention.  We have Judd Nelson as the punk, or at that time, stoner boy; Molly Ringwald as the school princess; Emilio Estevez as the super jock; Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd; and Ally Sheedy as the no-name freak.  It's quite a collection and, with the smart and sassy script, creates one of Hollywood's most engrossing films of the eighties and beyond.<p>If there is a remote chance you haven't seen this movie via TNT, Blockbuster, or TBS, I highly recommend this flick. It is funny, sad, intriguing, and most of all, is the hallmark of every eighties teen film, surpassing even the likes of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and yes, even Fast Times at Ridgemont High. <p>You can't go wrong with The Breakfast Club. Be warned, though, there are plenty of vulgar words and sexual innuendos in this film but hey, that just comes with the territory.  <p>Note: this film also provides one of the greatest eighties songs of all time, Don't You Forget About Me by the Simple Minds. ENJOY!!</p></body></html>

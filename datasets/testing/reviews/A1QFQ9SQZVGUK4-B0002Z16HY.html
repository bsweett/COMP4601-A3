The key is that it is very psychological and character grounded, which gives you a look inside the bunker as the days numbered to a close. The film's controversy is obviously bunk. Does the film portray Hitler as kind & loving to his subordinates and dog, Blondi? Of course. He was human. Mad indeed, but in portraying him as "a master of all evil" we turn him into a one-dimensional character and lose sight of the true horror that humanity is capable of. From what I have read, the film remains very faithful to the historical accounts of what was happening those final days. I also think the film had a very good positive message spoken in the end by the real Traudl Junge, herself. While the story begins with her curiousity and blindness to serve her leader, ultimately she realizes that her youth and ignorance was no excuse. All of the information was available to her and she chose to turn a blind eye to it all. This says a lot about the America we are living in today.</p></body></html>

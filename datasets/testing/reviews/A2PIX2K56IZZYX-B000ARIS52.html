<meta name="summary" content="Easily the best of 2005................."></head><body><p>2005 has not been a banner year for movies, if I have to sit through one more super-hero movie I think I'm gonna puke. Between big Hollywood bombs and remake after remake, you can imagine the joy I received from watching this incredible movie. About as flawless as a movie can be this is film-making at it's best. I am not very familiar with Frank Miller and his 'graphic' novels, but I am very tempted to do some serious catching up with the man!!<br /><br />Have you ever seen a movie with so many a-list actors in your life? and here is what really surprised me, some of these actors generally make crappy movies (Brittany Murphy) but they all shine  here, big time. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke get the most screen time and both excell mightily, I'm sure it won't happen but some oscar consideration for best actor should be considered for either if not both. Willis is at his best as a cop with a bad heart feeling his age trying to do good by his one true love, Jessica Alba, who plays a stripper with a big heart. She also is great in this, and thank god, because she followed this with 'Fantastic 4' why Jessica, why? Mickey Rourke, who I have always enjoyed, even in some of his more poor movies, is just stunning here, he plays this so well, he makes sure you will be thinking of this character weeks after you've seen it. I have now seen this three times and his portrayal of a man fighting all kinds of inner demons, not to mention a serial killer and a corrupt priest  (played very well and very creepy by Rutger Hauer) is something I'll never forget.<br /><br />Clive Owen is 3rd in the depth chart, but what a job he does, and I think he needed this, it makes people forget he did the awful 'King Arthur' he plays a cop trying to save his lady from a real low-life of a man played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro. I mean this man is such a total sleaze-bag, and Del Toro absolutely hams it up, I'm guessing he had a blast playing this role. Brittany Murphy, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, is pretty solid as Owen's girlfriend. This is the same woman who did 'Little Black Book' and 'Uptown Girls' so this was a welcome change, hopefully this will help her pick better roles in the future, cuz' she is very attractive and really not that bad of an actress.<br /><br />Moving on, some of the smaller roles are some of the best. Now this may seem strange to most, but I think Elijah Wood (yes, Frodo) should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He does not say a word, but his performance as the serial killer is down right scary. The facial expressions he uses are sinister and perfectly timed, you watch they way he "meets his maker" and tell me that didn't make the hair on your neck stand right up!!! Devon  Aki is Meho, another who does not say a word, but is enchanting, until she whips out of of her many weapons and does some really not so nice things to alot of bad men. This was followed by D.E.B.S. Devon.......again, why?<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is sexy as hell as Gail, one of Clive Owen's former flings, she too is a bad-ass and Nick Stahl is the son of senator Power's Boothe, both are scum-bags, but Stahl is just nasty, nasty, nasty. His scenes with Willis and Alba towards the end are sensational to say the least. Michael Madsen, Alexis Bledel, and Carla Gugino also co-star, and like I said earlier, all contribute in one way or another.<br /><br />My only tiny, and I mean very tiny, complaint is Michael Clarke Duncan, he is very unbelievable and his role lacked the edge and depth of every other character, so this is two poor showings in a row from him, as he was really bad in 'Daredevil' but no big deal as most of that movie was atrocious.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez, for the most part, is a visually gifted director, he has a special way of showcasing violence in a stylized way that few can compare with.'Desperado' is one of my all time favorites and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of the better horror vampire movies ever made. Although I have not seen any of the 'Spy Kids' movies, I know from there commercial success and with talking to alot of kids that atleast the first two are very well done. So it's a real shame that I recently heard that his latest kids fare, 'Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl' was such a flop.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie, it is hands down the best of the year, and I really hope it is not forgotten around academy awards season. This is expertly acted and directed, and is simply one of the best-looking movie's I can remember. I hear there is a new version coming out, with extended scenes and the infamous "not rated" tag. So you can bet I'll be first in-line when the date is announced.<br /><br />acting.............5 stars, Rourke and Willis amaze, so does the rest<br /><br />directing..........5 stars, Rodriguez is so gifted<br /><br />special effects....5 stars, Not over-done, perfectly timed.<br /><br />action rating......5 stars, Amazing gun-fights, great chase scenes, suspense and a few one-liners thown in as well<br /><br />quality............5 stars, If I could give higher I would, incredible looking movie, no grain, no gliches, flawless!!!</p></body></html>

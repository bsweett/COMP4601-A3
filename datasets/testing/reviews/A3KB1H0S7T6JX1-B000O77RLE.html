<meta name="summary" content="A Masterpiece/Guaranteed to shed a tear and much better than Flags of Our Fathers!"></head><body><p>Definitely a GREAT movie, Letters from Iwo Jima is Clint Eastwood's companion film to Flags of our Fathers and examines the Battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese.  General Tadamichi Kuribayashi arrives on Iwo Jima to see to the island's defenses prior to the American attack that is to follow.  While there, he will come across a wide spectrum of Japanese soldiers who are about to put their lives on the line for the defense of their families, their homeland, and their emperor.<br />Ken Watanabe and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% making this movie one of the best of its kind.  The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.<br />Balanced and fair, Letters from Iwo Jima is a movie about duty, honor, bravery, loyalty, inner strength, and the defeated side's heroes from a time long gone.<br />The battles, the costumes, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br />In conclusion, Letters from Iwo Jima is a film guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!</p></body></html>

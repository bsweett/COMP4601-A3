<meta name="summary" content="This movie KICKS ASS!"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of superhero movies. I loved the Chris Nolan Batman films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55H6">The Watchmen</a>, Iron Man, and the first 2 Spider-man films, but I didn't know anything about Kick-Ass when it came out in theaters. Only one of my friends had seen it, and I didn't hear any buzz about this film except the mainstream press criticizing it for its gratuitous violence. I was turned off by the ugly poster art and poor marketing, thinking it was some cheesy knock-off of the Watchmen.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. Having just watched it, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite films of 2010. It's an entertaining and suspenseful action movie with lots of guns and tons of violence. It's an anti-hero movie. The main character, Dave, sucks at being a superhero. He's just an ordinary high school kid with a dumb green costume made out of a wetsuit he bought online. The only thing he has going is an extraordinary ability to get his ass beaten on a regular basis because of his gross lack of fighting skills. A third of the way into the film, he is saved from certain death by two real superheroes, Big Daddy and Hit Girl and their story arcs converge. Big Daddy (who dresses like Batman/Night Owl) and Hit Girl are father and daughter, two highly-skilled vigilantes out to settle a personal score with drug kingpin Frank D'Amico. Nick Cage, who I'm not normally fond of, I liked in this film as Big Daddy. 13 year old Chloe Moretz plays Hit Girl. She is both adorable and deadly. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as annoying as ever.<br /><br />Visually, Kick-Ass is superb. It's stylish and super-violent in the same way that the Watchmen was violent and stylish (but not nearly as violent as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035V35PI">Ninja Assasin</a>). Lots of people die in fancy, inventively-choreographed and cleverly shot ways. There's a ridiculously over-the-top John Woo-styled clip reloading/gun catching sequence and a mini-gun/jet-pack at the end, but it's all in good fun. Gun geeks will also drool over all the hardware hanging in Big Daddy's safe room and the SMAW (shoulder-launched rocket). Lots of blood. Lots of stabbings. One guy even gets blown up in a microwave. If you don't like violence, stay far away from this movie.<br /><br />Story-wise, Kick-Ass shares many similarities with the Nolan Batman films, The Watchmen, Spider-man, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4SA">L&eacute;on: The Professional</a> in that the heroes are human and fallible. The film takes place in Brooklyn and other parts of New York City, but it's quite obvious from the locations that it was shot elsewhere (Toronto, Canada) for budgetary reasons.<br /><br />If you enjoyed any of the films I've mentioned in this review, you'll probably enjoy Kick-Ass too.</p></body></html>

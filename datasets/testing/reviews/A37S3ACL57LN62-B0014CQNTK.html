There are plenty of other films that do the same thing and are never even considered for Oscars. Additionally, this movie's script ranges from the utterly typical to the overly thought-out in which case is equally un-Oscar worthy. What should be rewarded, instead, is consistency, and this movie lacks that in spades.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is a somewhat masculine and alternately strange 16 year old girl with the inability to understand herself and the people around her. She discovers she is pregnant with the child of an awkward friend (Michael Cera) and immediately decides to have an abortion. Without much consultation from the father of the baby, she heads down to the clinic to discover a schoolmate protesting the murder of babies that already have fingernails. Juno changes her mind, and with the help of her best friend (Olivia Thirlby) searches for needy couples in the Penny Saver. She finds her perfect match, a wealthy duo (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) who have been trying for years to conceive without any luck. Upon meeting them, she signs her baby away and that is that. However, a strange connection is formed between Juno and her future baby's daddy which throws a wrench into the situation.<br /><br />An entertaining though somewhat boring romp about teen pregnancy, Juno makes us laugh with its quips and wacky situations but it is hardly cutting edge. With funnier and more memorable movies like Saved! and Knocked Up coming before it, Juno is by now a typical story that cannot be redeemed with its slightly less typical characters. Enjoyable, yes, but outstanding, no.<br /><br />This DVD features some unfunny deleted scenes and gag reels. The one and only gem is a scene with the old woman who threw out a living room set who says, "Jesus loves all colors, except Mexican."</p></body></html>

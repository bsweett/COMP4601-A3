<meta name="summary" content="What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why is he so horny"></head><body><p>After watching this film I checked online to see how much this film cost to be made.  Normally, I do not do this, but upon seeing this movie I had to see where all the money went.  When I discovered that it cost nine million dollars to create, I was flabbergasted.  Where did they put all the money?  For those that argue that the money is in the production, I would beg to differ.  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle was one of the worst productions that I have ever seen.  Even for a pre-teen comedy, it continually felt fake and "sound-staged" instead of fun and humorous.  You could tell, from scene to scene, which ones actually involved Harold and Kumar being out in the real world and those that were created in a Hollywood studio.  The infamous green-screen was very apparent in nearly 80% of the film, giving us that impression that not much was spent to make this a quality picture.  Again, I ask, where did the nine million go?<br /><br />The acting was average.  You are not dealing with comedy heavy hitters in this film, but instead two actors that gained some popularity due to films that actually spent their money on production, American Pie and Van Wilder.  While I will admit that both of these films stand on their own two feet, I cannot agree that Harold and Kumar does the same.  The acting hurt the comedy, which ultimately hurt the film as a whole.  I think what hurt the actors directly were the apparent lack of character development that was so desperately needed to find these guys funny.  I think I may have laughed a bit more at their jokes if I knew who they were and what pressures that they were feeling in life to get to where they currently are in life.  The brief seconds at the beginning of the film just didn't cut it for me.  For those that claim that they are just "stoners", I would have to argue that they are more.  Their high spirits and sense of fun does not come from smoking weed, but because they are not challenged in life and desperately seek adventure.  That is who I saw in this film, not just stoners, but adventurers that needed their quest.  Sadly, I do not think the general population saw this because of the crass humor, the cheapened production values, and overall the lack of defined acting by John Cho and Kal Penn).  Do I need to ask where the nine million dollars went again?!?<br /><br />Aside from the horrible acting by our guides, and the funnier parts of the film coming from our side performers like Jamie Kennedy and Ryan Reynolds, the jokes just didn't seem like they worked for the most part.  The Neil Patrick Harris scenes felt as if they were placed in the film just to be "cool" and to resurrect a struggling actor that had some success as a child.  I didn't capture the full purpose that the director went with Harris because the budget was NINE MILLION DOLLARS!  Another actor could have been funnier, but instead Harris was called upon to grope women and provide some of the unfunnier moments.  The girls in the bathroom scene were uncalled for and definitely lacked the actual comedy appeal.  Perhaps I am getting to old, but I desire more films like Van Wilder that relies heavily on the sharp tongue of the main actor instead of amateurish humor.  I continually felt that the director used over used techniques of past teen comedies to monopolize his film and make himself some cash.  He was not being creative, but instead repetitive, and it hurt this film.<br /><br />Finally, I need to bring up the production values again, especially near the end of the film where it became apparent that money had run dry and the green-screen effect needed to be used and abused.  You could tell that you were on a set and not actually following two twenty-something on their adventure.  This completely ruined my sense of fun for this film.  With a nine million-dollar budget, could they not get actual shots of these two driving in a real car?  To me, we moved past that technique in the early 60s, and we do not need to repeat it for this feature.  I felt cheated watching this film, wondering where my money and Hollywood's money went, thinking that perhaps the director is lighting his own weed with $100 bills while enjoying his free samples from White Castle since they used the name in the film.  Cheapened production values is what soured this film for me.<br /><br />Overall, I was high disappointed in this film.  With fresh thoughtful comedies being released everyday that actually use your mind and intelligence to make you laugh, this film resorted to last-years trend (already too dated) of bathroom humor and nudity to make their characters likeable and work.  Cho and Penn need to work a bit harder on some supporting roles before making another big jump, which in this case was very premature.  The supporting stars in this film had a chance to shine through and they took it proving that Ryan Reynolds could be the next Chevy Chase and Jamie Kennedy is funny.  Outside of this, I am still seeking an answer to the age-old riddle of where the NINE MILLION-DOLLAR budget disappeared to!<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></body></html>

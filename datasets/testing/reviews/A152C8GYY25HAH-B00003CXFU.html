Examples include A Civil Action in 1998 and The Insider in 1999. Despite much critical praise, these movies were apparently perceived by audiences as being too dry. Such was not the fate of Erin Brockovich, which became the first smash hit of 2000. Perhaps having Julia Roberts as the title character fighting for justice helped make the difference. I know it didn't hurt. <p>The picture opens with Erin desperately looking for a job. She's twice divorced from no good husbands and has a child to support. After one interview, she is injured in a car wreck when another driver runs a red light. She decides to sue the other person, not because she is greedy, but because she needs to be compensated for her medical expenses. She turns to a lawyer named Ed Masry [Albert Finney], a very busy man who virtually assures her that she will win. Ed does not factor in Erin's flashy, almost trashy taste in clothing or her tendency to spew out four letter words when she is angered. Her appearance on the witness stand is a disaster, and they lose the case, which brings forth a tirade on the lawyer from Erin. Meanwhile, she meets a decent guy who winds up frightening her. She has had such rotten luck with men. In an ironic turn of events, she ends up working for Ed Masry. The other women in the office are pretty hostile, since Julia's style is hardly what we expect in a staid law office. Erin persists, and one day she discovers a case that has been on the office's back burner. It involves a group of people who live adjacent to one of Pacific Gas and Electric's plants. There is a probability that these people have been poisoned for years by chromium the company has allowed to seep into the local drinking water.<p>There are several things which make the movie work. Much of it concentrates on two very interesting characters, Erin and Ed, rather than on the workings of the legal system itself. It also plots the progress of a remarkable woman. Erin starts off as an intelligent woman with vitally no marketable skills. Also lacking any skills at dealing with other people, she seems destined to be someone who works a lifetime just to eke out a living. For some inner reason, this legal case mesmerizes her. It requires her to learn a whole lot very fast and to put her personal life aside for a cause worth fighting for. In the process, we watch as a whole new woman emerges. Her progress is at least as interesting as the legal battle's. <p>Julia Roberts and the great British actor, Albert Finney, are splendid as Erin and Ed. The way they play off of each other reminds me of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. There is no sex involved, but this is decidedly a battle of the sexes. She's too brash and outspoken for him, and he's too stuffy and cautious for her. It is a case of opposites attracting. As for the movie itself, it's a case of a job well done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Wonderful Adaption"></head><body><p>I was thrilled with this adaption of the C.S. Lewis classic.<br /><br />Since it was a Hollywood movie, I'd hoped that it wouldn't be "Hollywoodized"--meaning that the Christian symbolism would be written out.  On the contrary, it looks like it was happily embraced!<br /><br />(Were there any believers out there who DIDN'T see the visual connection of Aslan's pawprints on the beach in his final scene with the well-known "Footprints" plaque?)<br /><br />For the adults, I'd like to also recommend the 1993 film SHADOWLANDS, which stars Anthony Hopkins as C.S. Lewis and Debra Winger as Joy Gresham.  A lot of insight into his Narnia mindset.  Have plenty of tissues on hand: it will break your heart.<br /><br />For kids, here's to hoping the rest of the series makes it onto film!</p></body></html>

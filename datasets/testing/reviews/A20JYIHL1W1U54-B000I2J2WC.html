<meta name="summary" content="Understated Epic"></head><body><p>This is great fimmaking. Ron Howard breaks new ground with this one. This is an epic film told with subtle and quiet style. The cast is very good. The score is very good too. There are twists and turns but it never becomes too obvious because of Howard's direction. I will not compare it to the book. Not fair really. I liked this film.</p></body></html>

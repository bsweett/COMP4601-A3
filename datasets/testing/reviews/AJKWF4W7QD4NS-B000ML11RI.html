<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, brutal, and breathtaking: welcome to Sin City"></head><body><p>The most faithful comic to film adaptation of all time, Frank Miller's Sin City is brilliantly realized by maverick director Robert Rodriguez, combining Miller's gritty and pulpy stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) with completely rendered, digital backgrounds.  The three stories, although separate, are meticulously intertwined, and brilliantly brought to the screen with one of the biggest casts ever assembled for a comic to film adaptation.  Disfigured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke, perfectly cast), uncovering a plot orchestrated by a sinister cardinal (Rutger Hauer) while tracking down the cannibalistic killer (Elijah Wood, unbelievably creepy) and seeking revenge for the death of his true love (Jamie King).  Then, there is Dwight (Clive Owen), a good guy at the wrong place at the wrong time.  His efforts to stop the violent ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of a barmaid (Brittany Murphy) goes horribly wrong, and leads to a showdown with the girls of Old Town, and a stunner of a revelation that promises blood flowing in the streets.  The final story revolves around old cop John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and his attempt to take down a psychopath (Nick Stahl) who kidnapped a little girl, but he himself ends up in jail.  Eight years later, Hartigan gets his chance to save her again (Jessica Alba, hot as ever) in a climactic showdown with a yellow skinned psychopath.  The casting is excellent for the most part, including Rourke, Owen, and Del Toro perfectly cast as Marv, Dwight, and Jackie Boy respectively.  The rest of the cast, including Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Devin Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Nicky Katt, and even Miller himself, give memorable performances.  Rodriguez (who shares the directing credit with Miller, and Quentin Tarantino even helms a scene as well) uses the comics as directly as possible: from using Miller's art as storyboards to using the dialogue almost exactly, Sin City is easily the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.  Brilliant, brutal, and breathtaking, Sin City is a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

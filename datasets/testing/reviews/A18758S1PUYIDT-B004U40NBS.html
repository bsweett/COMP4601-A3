<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing psychosexual ballet film"></head><body><p>This is certainly original:  it is about ballet, about a very trouble and self-destructive young woman under enormous pressure from her artistic director and herself, as well as her controlling mother, who treats her like a child; there are some weird moments when Nina thinks she is morphing into a real black swan.  Leave it to the director and writers to come up with something bizarre yet very memorable and mesmerizing to watch.<br /><br />Natalie Portman gives the physical and emotional performance of a lifetime as the bulimic dancer who wants to be perfect but will pay a terrible price for it.  Mila Kunis is fascinating as a rival dancer for whom Nina has an attraction (if you don't want to see girl on girl action, just fast forward a bit), while Barbara Hershey is in full form as Nina's pushy, infantilizing mother.<br /><br />Great choreography and photography too, and a nice soundtrack.</p></body></html>

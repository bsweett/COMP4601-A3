<meta name="summary" content="Alice? Really?"></head><body><p>The good news is that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, as a team, always dazzle - and this time is no exception. Effects are truly special: the Tweedles, Red Queen, and all the rest come across with utterly realistic surrealism. The initial fall down the rabbit hole has just the right roller-coaster sensation: scary, but not too scary. And the star power here - too many notables to name - means that acting talent will help smooth over bumps in the scripting. Then, Burton's inevitable dark note brought this closer to Dodgson's Alice than nearly any other. I expected this to supplant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305779635">Svankmajer's</a> peculiar fantasy or that amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CG8I8">BBC version</a> as my favorite.<br /><br />My favorites need not have worried. This movie offers fair adventure, a young heroine rising to heroic demands, a modern bit of rebellion against Victorian constraints, and delighfully bizarre fantasy. It just doesn't offer Alice as we knew her. Instead, Burton let Alice grow up, then placed her within a sequel to Lewis Carroll's originals. I always have reservations about modern writers collaborating posthumously with others no longer able to defend their work - and this just helps solidify that distrust.<br /><br />So, this movie presents an effect-filled romp, with some novel effects that I expect to see more of. It brings a modern rewriting to straight-jacketed Victorian sexism. It splashes the screen with amazing visuals (even in 2D). It just isn't Alice. Therein lies my disappointment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

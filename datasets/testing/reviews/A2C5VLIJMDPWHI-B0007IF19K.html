I can't even handle seeing the last scene with his little brother--crushes my heart every time.  It is intriguing to watch the story of Ray Charles life as a father, a singer, a musician, a player, a dreamer, vulnerable, strong, determined, lonely, a junkie, a business man, and listen to the tunes I have learned so well.  Jamie Foxx did a phenomenal job playing an extraordinary man.</p></body></html>

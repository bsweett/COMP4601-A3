From the first moment to the last, this movie is touching, moving, action-packed, humorous and just plain unbelievable.<br /><br />I can't add much to my review that hasn't already been said, but I like this collector's edition. I liked the extras and I loved watching the finished product. Tom Hanks brought this character to life. This movie isn't a script. It's a story that Tom Hanks took control over. It's a part that he was born to play. And he played it to the hilt!<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved loved this movie!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Burton and Depp Outdo the Story!"></head><body><p>I always liked the story of "Sleepy Hollow," but I felt it was overrated. This movie is a MAJOR improvement. The original story is basically this; Ichabod (an eccentric school teacher) comes to town; he falls in love with Katrina Van Tassel; Bram Bones gets jealous; Bram Bones gets jealous; Bram Bones dresses up like the Headless Horseman and chases Ichabod out of town.<br /><br />This movie changes the story (in my opinion) for the better. Ichabod is a constable who is having trouble with his superiors. (Notably Christopher Lee.) They send him to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow so he can prove his scientific methods for solving crime. (One is at least entitled to wonder if they are hoping he will get killed.) The first thing you will notice about Ichabod Crane (now a constable) is that he is A LOT MORE INTELLIGENT than in the book. He arrives at Sleepy Hollow and finds the people to be clannish. But he does make some friends who are willing to help him. While he is eccentric, we can see that his methods for solving crime have their logic.<br /><br />Bram is of course jealous when Ichabod has his eyes on Katrina. The events of the original story are quickly gone through. But this time, Bram succeeds in scaring Ichabod only for a moment, rather than away.<br />Ichabod then encounters the real Headless Horseman. While Ichabod is obviously terrified, he pulls himself together to find out what he can. (Even someone who comes back from the dead to kill could be following a pattern and have some motive.) One especially artful moment is when Ichabod is cutting at the tree of the dead. He gets splattered with blood, and we are not quite sure whether we should laugh or be scared.<br /><br />Without giving the story away, the more Constable Crane finds out, the more scared we can get. (Especially when Depp learns that the Horseman is not killing at random, and some live person may be controlling him.) Recognition can be VERY SCARY if well done. Poor Depp is also fighting his nightmares from his past. He has nightmares about his the murder of his mother and why he prefers logic and reason over religion.) The climax defines horror, and there is an especially interesting twist. (We are allowed at least a moment of sympathy for the Headless Horseman, who was so well played by Christopher Walken I may add.)<br /><br />Between the phenomenal scenery, the great music, the interesting deviations from the book, the interesting connections between Crane's past and present, the great acting by Depp, Gambon, Ricci, Lee, Walken, and others, the gradual unfolding, and the surprise twists, this movie is a masterpiece of horror. Johnny Depp will probably always be best known as Edward Scissorhands and Captain Jack Sparrow. But personally, I think this is his best movie.</p></body></html>

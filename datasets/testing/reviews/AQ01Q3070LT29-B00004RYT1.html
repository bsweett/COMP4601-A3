<meta name="summary" content="This DVD includes never-seen-before "Censored Shot"."></head><body><p>The entire one hour and forty-seven minutes of the film is all here.  Psycho (1960) is still the most eerie and terrifying thriller ever made of its kind.  The DVD version is crystal-clear.  In the "Bonus Features" is a one hour and thirty-seven minute documentary that includes all the secrets of making the film plus an entertaining and delightful interview with Janet Leigh.  There is also a "Censored Shot" of Janet Leigh that never made it into the film that you can see here on DVD.  The six-minute trailer of "Psycho" with Alfred Hitchcock giving you a tour of the outside sets and inside sets is on the DVD too.<br /><br /> The A&E cable network will be broadcasting a 10-episode tv series in 2013, which is a prequel to PSYCHO (1060). It will show the relationship between young Norman Bates and his mother.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Remake by Someone Who Loved the Original"></head><body><p>There is so much to rave about when it comes to John Carpenter's "The Thing", whether its the excellent acting, the chilling musical score, the eye popping special effects, the phenominal ending....I and it appears countless reviewers can't say enough about this 80's classic. In today's remake frenzied Hollywood, "The Thing" really stands out, if for no other reason than you can tell the man behind the remake loved the original film. There are several scenes in Carpenter's film that pay homage to the original movie, like when the Norwegian scientists are seen measuring the ship in the ice by standing in a circle, or when Mac discovers the thawed out block of ice that once contained the monster. Compare what Carpenter did with "The Thing" to Spielburg's recent "War of the Worlds" remake. Even though they are both remakes, Carpenter's feels original while "War of the Worlds" feels processed and approved by some board somewhere, there wasn't anything new brought to the table with "War of the Worlds". And while "The Thing"'s special effects were groundbreaking, and innovative at the time, the film didn't rely upon them to carry it along. As a horror fan I am glad we got to see all of the gory transformations in Carpenter's film, but really if you were to remove all of the gory scenes from "The Thing", there is still more than enough meat to the story and plot to carry it along. If you were to remove the special effects from "War of the Worlds" most people would have left the theater about halfway through. "War of the Worlds" was all about the effects first, and storytelling second. "The Thing" still stands as one of the best remakes to come out of Hollywood, and deserves to be called a classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alice's Return to Underland"></head><body><p>A very creative (some may say bizarre) take on Alice's return to Wonderland.<br />Some may say bizarre.<br />But it beautifully ties up the story as the 19 year old Alice returns to Wonderland (Underland) to see some of her old friends and fulfill her destiny which is to end the reign of terror by the White Queen.<br />The young Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is an independent minded and head strong girl who suffers from a recurring night mare.<br />At a garden party she is expected to accept the proposal of marriage by the toffee nosed young Lord Ascott.<br />She excuses herself before following the white rabbit once again into a grotto (the same one she had entered 13 years before) and once again falls down the whole into wonderland.<br />There she stumbles across Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse) and the remarkably strange and wonderful Mad Hatter in a role that seems to be typecast for Johnny Depp.<br />She enters the court of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who mistakes her entirely for someone else (who she refers to as Um), while all the time the Queen is after Alice.<br />but it is through battling wild creatures such as the Bandersnatch and dodging the forces of the evil Stayne, the Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover)<br />Leading a rebellion against the tyrant Red Queen she flees with her friends, the Mad Hatter, the rabbit and various other characters from the original to the court of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) where she is to fullfil her destiny as a dame in shining armour to battle the Jaberwocky<br />While there are scenes where you may wonder where the movie is going it all comes together beautifully.<br />Just the right dose of the bizarre and dark for the slightly philosophical yet entertaining adventure that the director was aiming for. Though this is not a children's movie and has some strange and potential frightening scenes and sequences.<br />Mia Wasikowska was beautiful, charming and strong as Alice, with the right qualities for what the 19 year old Alice was supposed to be<br />I hope I will see her in movies in months and years to come</p></body></html>

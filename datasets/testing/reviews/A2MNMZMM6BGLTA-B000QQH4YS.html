The villians are just about as slimey, hateful and evil as they come. Ronnie Cox is great in a turn from his usual nice guy roles of the past. All the special effects and Weller in that big old clunky costume are just great. I enjoyed this movie in the theater many years ago and it still holds up. Lots of tongue in cheek stuff mixed with some ultra violent insanity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Once Upon a Time in Post-Apocalyptic America"></head><body><p>Though the film is based on the original script by first-time writer Gary Whitta, the mood and atmosphere of "The Book of Eli" feels more like that of a Western or a graphic novel. Some viewers may think the film's premise is similar to that of the 2009 film "The Road," but unlike the Cormac McCarthy adaptation and its grim realism, action-packed "The Book of Eli" aims more for entertainment, but not in the same way as the "Mad Max" series did years ago. And the film's story itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief, its ending in particular.<br /><br />Set in the bleak world of post-apocalyptic USA, "The Book of Eli" follows the tale of a lone man (Denzel Washington) travelling across the country, carrying a certain book. Not much is known about him - except he has been wandering for 30 years and that to protect the book, he is ready to fight and kill. And he is very good at that.<br /><br />The man arrives at a town dominated by a local mobster Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie has a monopoly on the town's water that is still uncontaminated after the global disaster. He is looking for a book to consolidate his status as ruler of the community, and he is going to have it no matter what it takes.<br /><br />"The Book of Eli" is directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, known for "From Hell," adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Their inspiration comes from many sources - Segio Leone, for instance. Eli's fighting style looks more like a swordsman's. It is fast and deadly.<br /><br />With the cast including Ray Stevenson, Tom Waits, Jennifer Beals and Michael Gambon and its impressive visual sense, "The Book of Eli" succeeds in what it sets out to do, Post-Apocalyptic Western action.</p></body></html>

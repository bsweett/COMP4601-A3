<meta name="summary" content="O'Toole's Brilliant Performance Adds a Star"></head><body><p>According to Homer, Paris stole Helen from King Menelaus of Sparta. More than 4,000 years later, Peter O'Toole steals this film with one of his most thoughtful and sensitive performances in a supporting role as Priam, King of Troy. Thanks to modern digital technologies, the battle scenes are terrific. Most of the cast members are OK and I think director Wolfgang Petersen was wise to omit various gods and goddesses which Robert Wise saw fit to include in Helen of Troy (1955). Pitt is generally credible as the hubristic, athletic, sullen, and lethal Achilles...at least until he opens his mouth. Troy's greatest warrior, Hector, requires more than Eric Bana delivers. (I got the distinct feeling that Bana's Hector would be more comfortable in a cardigan sweater, smoking a pipe, than in armor and carving up opponents with a sword.) Sean Bean is quietly effective as Ulysses. It was a bold decision and, I think, a wrong one to have Orlando Bloom portray Paris as a confused wimp throughout most of the film. (I am not alone when reacting "She ran off with HIM?") Petersen gives Diane Kruger (as Helen) little to do which I also think was a mistake. Indeed, others in supporting roles are essentially decorative. Julie Christie appearing briefly as Thetis, for example. However, O'Toole's performance and the action scenes (including the plundering and destruction of Troy) enhance this otherwise unremarkable film. Also noteworthy is the revelation of Agamemnon's motives. Raging with righteous indignation, he publicly demands justice after his sister-in-law is "stolen" by Paris. He  organizes and leads an invasion force to reunite Helen with her husband. However, what we soon realize is that Agamemnon really wants Troy's wealth and, of even greater importance, Spartan control of the trade routes. This film lacks the depth, nuance, edge, and cohesion of other epics such as Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, and even Gladiator but it does provide entertainment sufficient to earn a Four Star rating by this reviewer.</p></body></html>

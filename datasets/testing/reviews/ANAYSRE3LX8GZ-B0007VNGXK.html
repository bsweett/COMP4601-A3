<meta name="summary" content="A suprising film....bonus features are lame.....  EGGS"></head><body><p>When I first saw the trailer to this film, i admit i turned my nose up at it. It looked to be another one of those stupid, over the top, CGI overboard movies. I ignored it completly when it came out in theatres.<br /><br />I only watched it on a rainy day when I had nothign better to do, and nothing better to watch. (my old man bought it if you care) and to my suprise, the movie was absolutly nothing like I thought it would be. It was the complete opisote!<br /><br />I wasnt expecting anything but something i'd eventualy turn off after a while, but it was not boring or turning me off with over-used CGI or corney little things that dont make sense or are put there for no reason. I had no idea what comic book the movie was based on, i'd never heard of Hellboy. So I was actualy quite suprised to have enjoyed this film.<br /><br />I wont bother with another reveiw of what it's about, there should be enough here already about the plot and whos in it ect....<br /><br />what I will say to those who do own the DVD.<br /><br />There is a couple of hidden features if you havent already found them.<br /><br />After Intro Speech: On disc 1 play that stupid intro thing, then when it's done and your back on the main menu, press up and you'll have selected to little yellow dot things, press enter on your remote and you can watcch that guy say some things about his cue card.<br /><br />Quotes: go to the special features menu. Highlight the main menu bit, then press down, some more of those things will be selected, press enter and you'll get a screen with qoutes from whoever that guy is. Press your arrow keys to toggle through them.<br /><br />Credits: Heres a real thrilling one, do the same as above, highlight menu, then press down, now press down again and press enter and you get to veiw the DVD credits, whoo hoooo<br /><br />2nd disc<br /><br />Alternate Intro(Storyboard): on the main menu select "Kroenans Lair" then select "animatics" then on the next screen press down twice and enter.<br /><br />Apocolypse Veiw: select "Board-a-mati" from the "Kroenen's Lair" and like the last egg, press down twice & then enter, and you will get to watch a pre visualisation of the apocolypse bit.<br /><br />Egg Hatching Storyboard: go to the 'Storyboard Comparison' menu, accessible from "Kroenen's Lair."  press the Down arrow key once again and follow it up by the 'Enter' key and you will be treated to a multi-angle storybaord-to-film comparison of the space devil hatching sequence.<br /><br />Another Cartoon: go to the 'Animatics' in 'Kroenen's Lair.' In the following menu press the 'Down' arrow key on your remote control until you highlight another three rings. This will give you the chance to view a short cartoon movie of Cpl.

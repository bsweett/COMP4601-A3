<meta name="summary" content="Here's a way to get into the holiday spirit"></head><body><p>Well, December is here, and it's now time to ramp up the anticipation for one of the most cherished holidays of all. You got it. It's time to dust off some DVD cases and get into the holiday spirit. And boy do we have a wide variety! There are dozens of films that we can enjoy watching during any time of December. Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, A Christmas Story, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street, and even Ernest Saves Christmas are ideal motion pictures for this time of year. Many people, however, consider It's A Wonderful Life to be the finest Christmas film, and it's not hard to see why. It's a loose adaptation of Philip Van Doren Stern's short story called "The Greatest Gift," and it tells of how wonderfully important your life really is, not only to yourself but to everyone that's close around you. It's well directed by Frank Capra, and it's one of the excellent motion pictures that that can really get you in the mood for the holiday spirit. Here's hoping that this movie will really last forever.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

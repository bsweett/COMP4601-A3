It was fairly predictable, an annoying lead character who I could care less about, and stereotypical charictures of cat food dealing thugs. When it comes to brilliant sci-fi films, I think Alien and Blade Runner, District 9 suffers from the desperation of original ideas and creativity and is part of a new generation of really bad movies.  Why watch this when you can watch more mystical and magical movies of the genre that have beautiful cinematography and offer you an escape.  There were times when I thought this was a boderline comedy, not that any of the intended jokes were funny in my oppinion.  District 9 was a hot mess to watch and I would never buy this trash yet alone watch it ever again.</p></body></html>

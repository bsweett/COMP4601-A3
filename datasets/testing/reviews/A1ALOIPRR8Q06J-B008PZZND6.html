Let me digress: Ever read _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_by Neil Postman? It's worth checking out. Anyway, I was hanging around the house a lot and this movie was playing on the HBO channels. At first I wasn't too interested to be honest. You know, seemed it might be a liberal Hollywood "message movie" and the subject matter didn't particularly appeal to me. I mean romance movies aren't my thing anyway and one about two dudes is just not my cup of tea. And there was so much buzz around it cause it's the "gay cowboy movie" and people are retarded and trip, in large part because of the very entertainment industry TV shows and magazines that are mainly responsible for generating the publicity for Hollywood products. But I started catching parts of it when I was hanging out channel surfing and ended up seeing the whole thing. ANYWAY, this is a very good movie, plain and simple. I was moved by it alright? I mean it got to me. And I made a point to tell friends. It bothered me that I felt even slightly funny about telling people I know that I liked the movie. I called BS on myself.<br /><br />The motivation for writing this here Amazon "review" for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is Heath Ledger's performance.<br /><br />Seeing Ledger in this role it was perfectly clear to me at the time that Ledger was going to be one of his generation's finest actors. I've heard from fanboys a million times over how awesome Ledger's performance as The Joker is and it really is an amazing performance and I completely agree. However, long before ever seeing THE DARK KNIGHT I knew Heath Ledger was going to be a superstar. I knew well before ever even seeing a clip of him as The Joker he was going to be great as The Joker solely based on his performance in this film and that THE DARK KNIGHT would make him a star.<br /><br />I'd also add that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a much better pictire than CRASH which won for "Best Picture" that year. Ang Lee is a truly great drama film director. ICE STORM and RIDE WITH THE DEVIL are also great and unique films. The tribute below is touching and I think perfectly articulates what so many have thought and felt..<br />___________________________________________________________________<br />"Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost.<br /><br />Rare is the performance that can honestly be called a "revelation," but that's what it felt like to watch Heath Ledger in "Brokeback Mountain." Not only did he bring iconic life and nuance to the existential loneliness of Ennis Del Mar, a taciturn but complex (and conflicted) character, but for such mature work to spring from the teen-idol star of "10 Things I Hate About You" and "A Knight's Tale" was... well, revelatory itself -- the astonishing revelation of a suddenly, fully developed actor whose juvenile efforts scarcely hinted he'd be capable of such moving depth and clarity. Ledger emerged as if from a cocoon, gleaming with promise and flexing his wings.<br /><br />Only two years after he received his first Oscar nomination for this iconic, star-making performance, it seems unthinkable that we should be mourning his death, at the age of 28...."<br /><br />-- outstanding film critic Jim Emerson.<br /><br />Couldn't say it better.</p></body></html>

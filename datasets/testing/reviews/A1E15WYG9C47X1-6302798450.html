Army of Darkness is essentially a comedy, absurd, over the top,and chaotic, but a comedy nonetheless.Even the blood and gore and those evil skeletons chasing our hero Ash (an excellent Bruce Campbell) have a comic feel to them, and this is exactly why the film works so well.The horror/comedy genre is a very grey area, and many a director has failed to get the right balance between the two,and as a result his/her film would be lost in predictable suspense and cheesy one-liners added for humour.However Sam Raimi,(like Spielberg and Tarantino,a director who has started his career early, driven by his passion for cinema),succeeds in sticking to absurd comedy,all dressed up nicely in the tension of the 'horror' atmosphere.<br />This edition is the best to own, because it includes Raimi's original movie, butchered at the time of its release by the studio.This saddens me to no end, to see executives who have no artistic or creative bone in them, deciding what the audience would like or not, and tampering with the director's own vision,(sometimes relying on a 'test audience'-but they are to creativity what a mosquito is to a good night sleep, a bloody nuisance).A very recent example of this,on the set of Exorcist 4 :The Beginning,is replacing  one of the best director/auteur in American cinema,Paul Schrader with Renny Harlin, because the studio and its test audience thought Schrader's copy was too psychological and did not have enough 'pea soups'!! what a scandal!<br />Anyway, back to Army of Darkness,<br />the studio version, which is 15 minutes less than the original film, has a sentimental happy ending, while Raimi's cut is more 'Planet of the Apes' apocalyptic, which gives an appreciative depth to the film.A lot footage was cut also from the battle scene, which although is not Lord of the Rings, it is quite well made for its budget.<br />So, Army of Darkness is a very good and hilarious B movie that you will immensly enjoy.Buy it and B entertained!</p></body></html>

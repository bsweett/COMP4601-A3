<meta name="summary" content="Streep and Broadbent Carry the Show"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent do the formidable job I would expect them to deliver as the Thatchers.  Margaret Thatcher was prime minister of the UK during the Reagan Era.  Streep captures her flawlessly.  I have lost count of how many biographical figures she has brought to life.  The last one I saw was of her as Julia Child and she was just as convincing.<br /><br />A good part of this movie is taken up with Thatcher's having dementia in her latest years.  Her husband has been dead for awhile of cancer but she carries on conversations with him constantly.  We cut back and forth in time to see her earliest years as a shop girl in her family's grocery to her beginnings in politics to her beginning as a member of Parliament.<br /><br />She is as conservative as Reagan was so was perfect for her era.  Although I personally don't care for her political persuasions, she was probably in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Some viewers may be upset with the emphasis on the dementia part of her life along with the hallucinatory conversations with Broadbent.  However, having had family members with this disease, I actually found that aspect more interesting than the politics.<br /><br />It is a good film with excellent performances by two old pros.</p></body></html>

My parents had seen the film and disliked it greatly sighting that it was boring and slow moving and nothing like they had expected.  Now I am never the one to follow my parent's advice, especially when it comes to entertainment, but there was something about this movie that screamed `TV Movie' to me and so I just didn't expect to like it much at all.  My wife wanted to see it though and so I conceded, and I must admit that since I love everything Oscar and feel this incessant need to embrace all that they embrace, at least so I can form an opinion, I wasn't hesitant about sitting down to watch the film.<br /><br />What I found though was a brilliantly crafted biopic that held my interest and proved to be highly entertaining.<br /><br />The film follows the days preceding the untimely death of Princess Diana and the media coverage of the Royal families reaction, or lack there of.  Young Tony Blair had just been elected Prime Minister before the tragedy and thus finds himself dealing with some very touchy issues very early on in his career.  The film does a fair job of trying to flesh out the motives of the royal family, especially those of the Queen herself, trying to make her appear real to the audience and maybe explain her strange behavior following the death of Princess Diana.<br /><br />This fleshing out of the Queen is due to the amazing portrayal by Oscar winner Helen Mirren.  This was a very challenging role even though it won't appear that way.  When watching Mirren converse and interact on the screen you will see no hysterics, no outburst of emotion, nothing that screams Oscar.  What you will see is a woman dealing with the situation that lay before her, the people in her life telling her one thing and another as well as her own thoughts and feelings on the matter.  What you will see is the buried emotion that hides behind her eyes as she takes in everything but never divulges a single emotion.  This my friends is very hard to do.  Hysterics and outbursts may be difficult to tame and make believable but completely reserved emotion is just as hard to accomplish.  Helen Mirren soars in this regard.<br /><br />The rest of the cast hold there own as well, especially Michael Sheen who portrays Tony Blair as both thoughtful and understanding.  Blair is probably the most well rounded character aside from the Queen herself here, the balance of the cast falling a bit into the background proving to be more or less accessories to the two main characters.  James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms do excellent work here as Prince Philip and the Queen Mother (was it just me or did they make Helen Mirren up to look OLDER than Syms who was playing her mother), both providing some explanation as to the Queens actions that given week.  Both Philip and Elizabeth are portrayed as very headstrong and somewhat tactless individuals whose contempt for Diana spilled over into their reaction to her death.  Prince Charles is portrayed rather sympathetically by Alex Jennings who seemed to capture the essence that was and is Charles beautifully.<br /><br />Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan should be singled out though for helming the creation of this film.  Frears direction only magnifies the brilliance of Morgan's script that is both accurate (all biopics fail to be completely accurate, but in Hollywood terms this is quite good), witty, funny and engaging as well as educational for it helps the general public understand a little better a woman that not too many fully understand.  I won't deny the fact that, at times, `The Queen' does play out like a `TV Movie' for its production is not as polished as one might expect, but that in the end may be part of its appeal.  The lack of polish helps to keep the focus on the acting, which is miles above those found in `TV Movies'.<br /><br />I am not one who believes Helen Mirren gave the best performance of the year or even of her five fellow nominees but now that I have witnessed her performance I can't say that I am upset with her win either.  She showed true strength and temperance with her delivery and was commanding without being showy.<br /><br />`The Queen' is a movie I am glad to have seen and one that I will most likely see again for it proved to be much better than I had expected and delivered much more than I thought it could.  Is it in my top ten of the year?  No, but it is one of those `honorable mentions' that is worth just about everyone's time.</p></body></html>

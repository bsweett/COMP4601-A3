<meta name="summary" content="funny and touching, but predictable"></head><body><p>I rented this movie because the commercials made it look funny, but it was a little sad at the same time. I cannot add more to the other reviews, but Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were fantastic, so was Sean Hayes, you will not regret seeing this movie, it may even have you working on your own list.</p></body></html>

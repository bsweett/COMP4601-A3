<meta name="summary" content="A Tightly Written, Directed and Acted Controversial Thriller"></head><body><p>HARD CANDY is one of those films that took enormous courage on the part of the writer (Brian Nelson), director (David Slade), and producers - let alone the actors - to bring a tale of pedophilia to the mainstream audience.  Made for a small budget (yet the production values are so very artistic that it feels like an expensive film), HARD CANDY is essentially a duet for two actors: the actors Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deliver performances that become indelibly burned on the mind of the viewer.<br /><br />32-year old photographer Jeff has been chatting online with 14-year old Haley for three weeks using standard chatroom seduction lines.  They meet, talk, seem to get along well - until Haley invites herself to Jeff's home, much against Jeff's better judgment.  Once home the beautiful space in which Jeff lives (the set decor is splendid, using sensitive colors in a cinematic way), the walls adorned with photographs of young models, seems a fitting space for a fine photographer.  But soon the twist of the story explodes and Haley lets Jeff know that she is there to punish him for his pedophilia and for some specific events in his history.  She drugs him, and when he awakens Jeff is the captive, forced to undergo the intensive questioning and innuendoes from Haley, including being set up for castration.  The tension mounts to a peak as the two characters uncover aspects of each other; the final resolution of the long encounter comes as a stunning surprise.<br /><br />The quality of the film is so fine that no judgments are made: is Jeff truly a criminal pedophile?, is Haley insane?, can this reversal of roles happen?  The script is so beautifully written that it remains intelligent and straight, forcing the viewer to become involved in the quest for truth.  Ellen Page delivers a brilliant performance as Haley and Patrick Wilson steps out of his usual milk toast roles to create a man driven by strange needs who gradually comes to a point of self acceptance in one of the more powerful scenes of film this viewer has seen.<br /><br />The audience for this examination of pedophilia may be small and therein lies the pity. This is a film that deals with a tough subject so very well that the viewer gains an understanding into dysfunctional characteristics while being caught up in a suspenseful thriller of a story.  This is independent film making at its best.  Grady Harp, September 06</p></body></html>

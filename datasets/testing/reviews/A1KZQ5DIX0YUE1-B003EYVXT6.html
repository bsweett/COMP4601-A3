At least in this film, we can empathize with the poor creature, Dren. I will agree that the acting of the scientist couple is a bit melodramatic and over-the-top... but in the film's defense, genius is often earmarked with strange behavior. In this light, the film shines as a modern day Frankenstein. And believe me when I say that coming from me, that is very high praise indeed.<br /><br />But I can simply wax on the praise when it comes to these reviews. Often, I get slammed for being objective. But there's no objectivity needed in the second half of a BD review: the special features. Specifically, the lack thereof. There is a 35 minute 'spliced' together behind the scenes that doesn't follow any sort of index for contents - it's just kinda there. There first couple of minutes is actually filming the filming, an artsy-feeling thing that you pray isn't the whole feature. And it isn't. The highlights are Adrien Brody cutting up between takes and the girls who actually do the performance of Dren, especially the little girl that plays baby-Dren. Surprisingly, none of the Dren footage is 100% CGI. If we had more special features or even just a commentary track, this review would be a five-star opinion.<br /><br />But as the director states - this is the monster movie he's never seen. And that is a spot-on synopsis, and it is at the end of the day the reason I enjoyed the film as much as I did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INCREDIBLY AWESOME!"></head><body><p>I'm really not the biggest fan of all of these animated movies that have been released lately but this one was absolutely awesome. It's a perect family film and grownups and children alike will love it. The story is about superheroes that are forced to live normal lives by the government. (Without using their powers) Mr. Incredible is now fat, and depressed and is married ot Elasticgirl and they have three children. But, MR. Incredible wants back in the game and wants to be able to fight crime once again. So when a mysterious offer shows up, he tries to lose weight and take it. The movie itself is very funny with some very well made images and characters. If you want to watch a movie with the whole family, this is in my opinion your best bet. Everyone will be pleased with this choice as it's exciting, funny, and just really neat.</p></body></html>

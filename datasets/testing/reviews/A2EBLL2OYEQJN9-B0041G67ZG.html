<meta name="summary" content="Great entry in the political thriller/suspense genre for 2005"></head><body><p>This is an above-average international political thriller, bringing African politics and genocide to the game of American spy movies.  The moviemakers created a generic African country with a fake name to represent a number of tragedies on that continent in recent decades, and female lead Nicole Kidman plays a UN interpreter who grew up in the strife-ridden African country and has some revolutionary experience of her own.  Kidman's agenda is never really clear to her government handlers or to the viewer, and the plot is full of twists and turns.  This is one of the better thrillers of the year, so check it out if you enjoy this type of movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good but flawed"></head><body><p>Dark Water is an interesting beast.  As a familial drama it is superb.  It is filled with familiar and every day horrors, drama and tension that one would go through if she found herself divorced with no money and a child.  This is where the film is at the top of its game.  The fear is palpable and Jennifer Connely shows us once again why she is a leading actress of considerable talent.<br /><br />Like in her last great film, House of Sand and Fog, Connely's character is completely isolated and she is really good and showing that isolation and desperation.  You can tell when she picks her apartment that she knows she shouldn't live there but feels trapped by many different constraints.  It is here that the creepy characters effectively create more tension as you never really know the aims and goals of them.<br /><br />Adding to the familial drama is a social and economic drama of living in the apartment.  It creates a downpour of tension that is squeezed out of every frame.  Bad things will occur in this place, you can tell.  Then with the ominous leak in the cieling above the protagonists' beds and the brackish water, the viewer will feel oppressed just as much as Connely and her child.<br /><br />It is here that the movie falters and eventually falls apart.  Like I said, the movie is great as a familial drama, but it is also a ghost story.  But in this case, the ghost story takes the background as opposed to the fore front.  And it's unfortunate because instead of enriching the tension, it detracts.  The ghost story isn't fully fleshed out, partly due to the fact that the story is more enveloped with the drama and spends more time developing that.  In the beginning it works semi-well.  The water holds supernatural foreboding and the flashbacks and nightmares adds to it.  But as a ghost story mystery, which the movie tries to be, it takes its first faltering step.<br /><br />From there, horror film cliches pop up.  An invisible friend, the protagonist feared to be losing her mind, elevators that move on their own, ghostly noises and visages, etc etc.  Granted, some of it, particularly the protagonist feared to be losing her mind, is done exceedingly well but it's been done before.  And, in most cases, done better.<br /><br />Finally, because the ghost story isn't effectively developed, the ending crumbles under too much familial drama and not enough ghost story.  I blame this on the direction of the script.  It's trying to be a ghost movie with a bit of familial drama and instead it's more drama than ghost story.  And because of this, people will be ultimately disappointed.  And it's unfortunate.  I really enjoyed about 3/4 of the movie but was way too disappointed with the last 1/4th that I left the theatre sad that it wasn't executed as well as it could be.<br /><br />A 4 star review is probably too high.  As the drama, it's at least a 4 star if not 5.  As a ghost story it's less than 3.  But the acting was superb, the characters well developed (with the exception of the ghost) and the overal direction in terms of the director was pitch perfect.  Overall, though, it wasn't very thrilling or scary.  And that, above all, is what a ghost story should be.</p></body></html>

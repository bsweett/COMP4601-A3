<meta name="summary" content="Zach Braff's film of a young man finally waking up to life"></head><body><p>Our introduction to Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) after seeing him calmly sitting in the middle seat on an airplane that is apparently going down is to see him lying in a white bed in a white room looking like he is almost catatonic.  When the phone rings he does not answer it and we here a voice that turns out to be his father who has called to inform Andrew that his mother has drowned the previous night in the bathtub.  Although it has been years, Andrew will go home for the funeral and for the experience he decides not to take any of the pills in all of the neatly arranged bottles on the shelf in his medicine cabinet.  Clearly the drugs have something to do with his mother and by not taking them Andrew ensures that he will arrive back in New Jersey in a different state of mind.<br /><br />In good time we will find out why Andrews' father (Ian Holm) has been proscribing drugs all these years.  The relationship between father and son is one of the ways we can gauge the progress that Andrew is making in the film as he finds his own voice again.  We also learn that despite being overmedicated Andrews is a would-be actor who has managed to score a gig as a retarded quarterback in some sort of cable movie.  This means that every time he runs into somebody back home it becomes clear they are going to mention the movie, comment on how long it has been since they have seen Andrew, and say something about his mother being dead.<br /><br />I keep hearing that "Garden State" is "The Graduate" for this generation, but instead of seeing young Dustin Hoffman I keep thinking young Ray Romano (heavily sedated on drugs) every time I see Andrew.  I get the idea the film is also about growing up when you do not want to, but since Andrew does not sleep with Sam's mother there are some significant differences.  One of the problems of "Garden State" is that the character arc is basically Andrew waking up.  The movie petty much has to end when Andrew gets to the point that his eyes are finally open all the way, and that is basically what happens.  The other problem is the love story between Andrew and Sam (Natalie Portman), simply because the reason Sam likes Andrew is that Zach Braff, who plays Andrew, also wrote and directed the film.  So either the relationship only works because it is simply written that way or Sam puts a lot of faith in the opinion of a dog.  You decide.<br /><br />What Andrew discovers when he gets home is that while his life is pretty sad none of his old friends and acquaintances are doing any better.  He might think that his life does not make sense, but then he runs into Kenny, Jesse, Mark and a bunch of other guys he went to high school with and it is clear he is doing better than most.  This helps him start to get his mind wrapped around the idea that his glass might be half full instead of half empty, and we await either his final epiphany or for the character to crash and burn (remember the airplane bit at the beginning?).  At least with "Garden State" we know it can legitimately go either way.<br /><br />"Garden State" is more different than it is brilliant, which is what makes it stand out as an example of Independent filmmaking.  If you do not cotton to its Indy sensibilities and sense of humor, then there is a good chance this film will not click for you.  This is a film where what is considered funny are things like ordering bread in a Vietnamese restaurant, a hamster too dumb to figure out the rolling wheel, a couple living on a boat at the bottom of a quarry, and returning knives without a receipt.  "Garden State" is a dark comedy, stopping well short of being a black comedy, but just like eating chocolate some people will find it to be to dark to enjoy.  But Braff gets major props for including "One Of These Things First" by Nick Drake in the soundtrack.</p></body></html>

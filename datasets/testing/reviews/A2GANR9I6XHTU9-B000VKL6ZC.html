<meta name="summary" content="An Insult to the Original"></head><body><p>This isnt Halloween, this is a Redneck Halloween wannabee...<br /><br />This is what happens when people can't think of any new ideas. First try to copy and imitate the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with one movie... now do a remake of a classic and fail miserably.<br /><br />What exactly does this have to do with the original?... This is Rob Zombie's warped version of a classic.<br /><br />We have some twisted version of the 1970's with a family of Rednecks. Michael Myers is their child.  You can see the kids face- There is no mystery in this at all-  Then we have the same plot as the original with different things added. Then the story switches over to present day and the same old story except 10 times worse.  Here we have Malcolm McDowell as Doctor Loomis and the lady from E.T.... Even these good actors couldnt save this mess of a movie.<br /><br /> The horror genre really needs to think up something new instead of recyling the same old movies and failing at it. You have the greats and then you have the copiers and imitators who end up trying to copy legends and failing everytime. This is another example of that.  I strongly recomend you do not see this-  it will disapoint you. This is one of those movies that makes you wonder if theres any real future for the horror genre.</p></body></html>

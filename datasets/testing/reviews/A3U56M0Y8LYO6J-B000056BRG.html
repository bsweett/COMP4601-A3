Its production was the stuff of legend - years of preparation, an enormous budget for its time, and the talents of a famed director.  The end result was eleven Academy Awards.<br /><br />Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judea as the new tribune of the Roman province and meets with Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a boyhood friend who is now a wealthy member of the Jewish ruling class.  The bond between the two men deteriorates after Ben-Hur refuses Messala's request for help in restoring order to Judea.  After his family is arrested and he himself is sent to the galleys, fate intervenes when Ben-Hur saves the life of Admiral Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins).  Arrius frees him from servitude and Ben-Hur soon returns home to settle matters with Messala and find his mother and sister.<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" is indeed a spectacle.  This is epic filmmaking on the highest order.  Every inch of the screen is filled with lush and vibrant images and Heston delivers a powerful performance that anchors the film.  However, for all its grandeur, "Ben Hur" is also bloated and languid.  It seems that the film is more concerned at times with showing off its impressive production design than telling a coherent story.  The only time when "Ben-Hur" does come to energetic life is during the stunning chariot race sequence which deserves every accolade it has received over the years.  However, this one sequence is not enough to save the film.  The rest of the "Ben-Hur" is plagued with underdeveloped characters and a narrative filled with rough and awkward transitions.  Most fatal is the final act which feels like it belongs in another film.  Yet, it must be pointed out once more that Heston is spectacular.  He has undeniable screen presence and he commands your attention every time he speaks.  Too bad the other aspects of the film could not complement his tour-de-force performance.</p></body></html>

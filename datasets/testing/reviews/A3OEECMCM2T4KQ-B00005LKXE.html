<meta name="summary" content=""He Preferred  the Free Range Rude...""></head><body><p>Having read this book twice over a two year period, reveals some kind of fascination with the main character. The novel itself is the best of the series, and the film, directed by one of my all time favourite directors, Ridley Scott, had to be a perfect combination, and Scott's artistic sensibility as a methodical director, certainly shows in this gripping film.<br /><br />There is so much in this film that needs to be pointed out in terms of its artistic "film" qualities: all aspects - score, location, costume, art direction, screenplay adaptation and of course the impeccable performance by Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />Ridley Scott began as an art student and is well adept at pen and ink. It is known that he would show up early on location in Florence, and know one, not even the producers or Hopkins for that matter, knew what he would do next: because he would sketch the scenes in his note book at night, visualizing every scene - from the camera angles to the actors lines... for Ridley Scott, film is a real & true art form.<br /><br />Hannibal is one of the more interesting characters in popular literature/culture. An anti-hero of sorts, whose main reason for killing is rude people. In other words there seems to be a method to his madness.<br /><br />My wish was that the film ended in the same way as the book: much more final and chilling - which made more sense.<br /><br />Agent Starling relents in the book and through Hannibal's strength of will and power takes her to the dark side, both living quite well all over the world.<br /><br />However censorship is alive and well...<br /><br />For Starling to relent to Hannibal's hypnosis and power, to my way of thought, this was the perfect break through for a new story...rather than the terrible novel "Hannibal Rising" though the film however is exceptional; the tale should have moved forward rather than to its beginnings.<br /><br />Most fans disliked this film for strange reasons...though it is the best of the trilogy.</p></body></html>

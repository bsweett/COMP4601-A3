<meta name="summary" content="Heart, soul, feelings, action... one of the best movies ever"></head><body><p>Spiderman has always been a great comic.  Not because Spiderman was the most powerful superhero, but because he was one of the most human characters.  And this movie does not neglect to show this one bit.<br /><br />Peter Parker has many concerns, and most of them are because of his alter-ego, Spiderman.  He can't give the attention he wants to give the girl he loves.  His best friend doesn't trust him because of his affiliation with Spiderman.  He can't keep a job.  He isn't doing well in school.  All because being Spiderman is a full-time and often thankless job.  So, he is faced with the possibility of making his life easier by leaving his crime-fighting days behind him.<br /><br />Worst of all, he is still burdened with the fact that it was his fault that his Uncle Ben was murdered, and this is a heavy burden to carry and not share with others.<br /><br />And then there is the Spiderman side of this wonderful story.  Spiderman has a new enemy by a scientist turned mad-man with four metal and indestructible arms bent on recreating an invention that could destroy the city.<br /><br />The action is incredible.  The story is fantastic.  You care and feel for the characters.  This movie is unforgettable and nearly unmatchable.  You've gotta catch this movie if you are one of the few who haven't yet.</p></body></html>

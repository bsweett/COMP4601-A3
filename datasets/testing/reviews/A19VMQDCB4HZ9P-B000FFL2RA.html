<meta name="summary" content="Underappreciated historical epic"></head><body><p>First off this film is much better than Troy and Alexander combined. Ridley Scott's direction shows that he hasn't lost the ability to manage epics of this size. His talent as a former cinematographer and art director shows in spades in this film. The color palette changes from the cool, almost black and white scenes in France to the blistering earth tones of the scenes in the Middle East. If one can find any faults in Kingdom of Heaven it won't be for its art direction and cinematography. There are faults in this film, but not enough to ruin the film or slow it down the way it did for Troy and, to a greater degree, Alexander. The story seems to not want to create a specific bad guy to root for. Even the characters whose motives and behavior scream "villain" can be excused by their religious veiwpoints. This is one film where everyone involved makes decisions that can be seen as good or bad depending on the individual audience's point of view.<br /><br />The cast did an admirable job in getting lost in their roles. One specific stand-out has to be Ghassan Massoud's portrayal as Muslim General Salah al Din (Saladin to the West). Massoud has presence and is actually one of the few characters who seemed to go beyond the petty, religious politicking this film has piles of. I must admit that I never really believed Orlando Bloom as the character of Balian of Ibelin. He makes a convincing enough knight, but never as the protector of Jerusalem. Eva Green makes for nice eye candy, but I looked closely enough at her character develop and she did a better job as a young married princess much too cynical and old than what her appearance and age would suggest.<br /><br />But most people will come to see Kingdom of Heaven for its many battle set pieces. Outside of The Lord of the Rings battles, Scott's work in pulling off the battles between the Crusader and Templar armies against those of Salah al Din would count as some of the most brutal and massive engagement in film history. Scott did his homework well for these set pieces. As a military history buff I'm usually more critical of epic films depicting historical battles on film. There's not much to be critical about the accuracy of the Siege of Jerusalem. The final battle does look like it owes some of its execution to the Siege of Minas Tirith in the end of LOTR.<br /><br />The film succeeds well enough in recreating the fight for Jerusalem and the politics involved from all sides. The acting is very good overall though a few casting choices could've been made better. Overall this film is very underappreciated. Maybe people are not ready for an intelligent film about a contentious time involving two of today's major religions.</p></body></html>

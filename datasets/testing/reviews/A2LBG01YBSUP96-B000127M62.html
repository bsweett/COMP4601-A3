<meta name="summary" content="somewhere within this lies a good movie"></head><body><p>by good i mean in slasher flicks terms.lets go through the checklist.1)crazed lunatics....CHECK.2)high body count....CHECK.3)sexy,dumb as dirt girls just waiting to get beheaded....CHECK.4)gore factor....uuuummmmmm,check i guess.the shown violence was decent but at times cartoonish.5)cheesy acting....CHECK.6)believabilty....YEAH RIGHT.im still at a loss of how semi drowning gives jason invincibilty.and when hes down,not 1 person thought of lopping off his head?nah,that would not only kill jason but the cash cow.and finally,7)plot....uuummmmmmm,check kinda.pitting bad guys against eachother is a novel idea.but connecting them is the trick.if i had my way it would have been jason vs michael.but then again,2 silent stalkers isnt much fun.so in the end this is the best pairing.here,the kids are the typical dunce cap models,and adults even lamer.again,common sense kills the slasher/cash cow.to summerize(how official!)this is worth buying at a sale price of say,12.99(give it a month or so).</p></body></html>

If you are not, the picture and sound quality of this blu-ray could transform you to a Burton fun.<br /><br />The picture is spectacular and make you say that buying the HDTV and blu-ray was an worthwhile investment. It is a great movie to test your new systems and appreciate the sound and image quality.<br /><br />The story itself is sweet and the interchange of colors that Burton uses between the two worlds is not very clever but it reverses the roles (I won't elaborate  so not to ruin it for the people that have not seen it).<br /><br />Enjoy it</p></body></html>

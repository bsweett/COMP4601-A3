This movie hits you with all the skill of a blast from a shotgun.  You see in the first planet of the apes the other humans didn't talk for a reason, to have them talk would have messed up a perfectly good story(like it does in the 2001 verson).  So instead of seeing the new &quot;supercharged&quot; one just stick to the classics.</p></body></html>

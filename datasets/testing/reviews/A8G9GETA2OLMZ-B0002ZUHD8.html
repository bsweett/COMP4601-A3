<meta name="summary" content="Bad"></head><body><p>This movie has gorgeous scenery, terrific costumes, wonderful acting, but is bad.<br /><br />All because of a silly premise and ridiculous writing.<br /><br />The idea is that the REAL Arthur was half-Roman, half-English, and led a band of "Sarmatian" cavalry against various enemies of Rome in 452--in the farthest-flung, and failing, outpost of the Empire, Britain.<br /><br />So you get Roman soldiers, blue-painted Picts (or Druids), called "Woads," and yak-like Saxons, whose clothes are apparently made out of their hair, all fighting each other.<br /><br />There is incessant talk of "freedom."  This is never defined, but apparently it means taking orders from Arthur rather than Romans or Saxons.<br /><br />There is also much talk of "equality."  But this is a mere sop.  This is a frigid jungle, with law-of-the-jungle hierarchies.<br /><br />So the movie makes no sense.  It is beautiful to look at, between bash-them-to-bits Dark Age battles (of which there are many, many, many).  Lots of spurting blood, lopped-off arms, smashing, gouging, arrow-piercing, and so on.<br /><br />It has one memorable line (Kiera Knightley's before the battle on the ice).<br /><br />But mostly it is tedious and predictable and goes on for a very long time.</p></body></html>

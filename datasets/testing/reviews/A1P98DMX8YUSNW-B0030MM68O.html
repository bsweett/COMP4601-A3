Here, we go to Iraq for a few days in the lives of some bomb defusers. This is not a subtle movie. You will wonder why the US ever bothered to send people to such an absurd place. Tension builds throughout as we expect most of the soldiers to die grisly deaths. Some do. Some don't. In the end, we are told, some prefer this way of life over civilian life. HHmmmm....where have we seen that theme before in a story about battle-scarred soldiers? You won't learn anything watching this. I can't quite pronounce it entertainment, either.</p></body></html>

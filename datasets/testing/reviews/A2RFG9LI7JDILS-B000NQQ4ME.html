<meta name="summary" content="a good chase movie - action packed (what the masses like)"></head><body><p>Apocolypto was quite good - a movie you cannot look away from - full of action, suspense, brilliant on-location filming.. So what's missing? Well, that is all it has.. the only reason it is good is because it hides behind action.. the characters are supposed to mean a lot to us.. but 99% of the time they only mean a lot to us because they are in danger because they are about to be seriously injured.. this is a technique that is excellent in horror films but if we are expecting a drama or even an intelligent suspense film we want a little more..<br /><br />But enough of my quibbles, mel gibson deserves a great deal of credit for using the original language and for using the people of mexico and for the authentic costumes and all of that jazz... Nevertheless, like most of gibson's films it is essentially adrenaline.. no time for plot... no time for acting.. you are on the run..and you can't look away (this is the type of thing that endangers truly great movie-making.. big budget all action films)...</p></body></html>

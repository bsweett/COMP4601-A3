<meta name="summary" content="Those who do not appreciate life..."></head><body><p>In this sequel, we get to see more creatively twisted scenarios created by Jigsaw.  This time Jigsaw, played wonderfully by Tobin Bell, gets the cops by the balls when they come to capture him.  He is no longer able to flee and he has set up one of his finest and most brilliant "scenarios" elsewhere.<br /><br />We get to see much more of Jigsaw this time around, allowing us to get a true feel for what he is doing, and why.  We are granted insight into his personal situation and his frame of mind.  Jigsaw uses peoples' "dirty laundry" to entrap them and fuel their desire to live, as he did in the first.  He believes, given his experiences, that those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life.<br /><br />The movie is interesting, twisted and creative - and it follows up on the first movie very well.  You even get to briefly revisit the scene from the first movie, which was a great added touch.  The twist near the end of the movie is unexpected and clever.  I doubt that I would be as interested to see a third installment into the series, but this one was certainly solid.<br /><br />The bonus features are also quite interesting.  You get to see how Jigsaw's traps were created and put into action for the film.  There is also a cool featurette highlighting the props used in the movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended for horror fans.</p></body></html>

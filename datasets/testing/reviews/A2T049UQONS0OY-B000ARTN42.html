<meta name="summary" content="An earnest Russell Crowe in perhaps his best portrayal"></head><body><p>"Cinderella Man" is Russell Crowe's portrayal of Depression-era boxing champion James Braddock, a sort of everyman that resumed his career in advanced age and went on to capture the championship from Max Baer, relative to the actor that played Jethro in "The Beverly Hillbillies" television series.<br /><br />I don't know if there is a Russell Crowe bandwagon out there but, if so, I've never gotten on it. I assume any film starring Crowe to be overestimed, overrated and sometimes overdone. I was surprised that this film seemed to live up to its billing, in part due to Crowe's restrained but still one dimensional performance.<br /><br />No one should confuse Crowe with the great actors of his or any other era. To my mind he is today's ultimate leading man, a latter day John Wayne for this time. He lacks the five by five ability to act a role the way Daniel Day Lewis would. Still, he ensures box office and that's why he was cast here.<br /><br />He is mightily abetted in this above average film by two co-stars -- Renee Zelwegger, Hollywood's best actress (can't say the same for her personal life decision-making!) and Paul Giamatti, who was far better in this film than his stupid role in last year's silly and overrated "Sideways". Both these actors did well filling in the gaps around Crowe's touchy feely boxer-stevedore-father-husband-good guy-everyman.<br /><br />The boxing scenes in this movie showed (still!) the influence of 1981's "Raing Bull" with extreme close ups, stop action, odd camera angles and "reality" based filming intended to help you confuse what was going on in the movie with what really goes on in a boxing ring. I read no boxing magazine's review of the action that, to me, still looked more like Hollywood than Madison Square Garden circa 1935. My wife, who takes boxing lessons, agreed.<br /><br />The plum of this film is the otherlife of the lead role and his relationship with the 1929 stock market crash, ensuing poverty, public assistance, his colleagues in the boxing industry, frineds, wife and children.<br /><br />I wish this film (which is already long at 2 hours 15 minutes) had gone further into Braddock's life to include his World War II service and life after the war. It would have given the film greater continuity in a way "Everybody's All American" showed the lifespan of the LSU football player portrayed by Dennis Quaid.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty good flick about a guy that really existed in scenes and frames that will have you cheering for him and his family inside and outside the ring. Early Oscar buzz indicates this film may get a nomination for script or Giamatti's character. Whether that happens or not, you will probably enjoy an evening or two at home with the DVD.</p></body></html>

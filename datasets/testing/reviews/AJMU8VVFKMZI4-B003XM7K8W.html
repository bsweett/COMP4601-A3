Personally, I didn't understand why the questionable FBI didn't just show up sooner and do their thing.  Why did they need for Talley to run around for an hour worth of screen time if they were fully able to get in and look for their beloved DVD?  Plus, what was the urgency?  It was night time, all banks were close.  Wait to see if the stand off would last until the morning.  Jeez.<br /><br />Talley turned over the scene to a negotiator, why not kidnap that negotiators's family to make sure they got their DVD?<br /><br />All in all, I was still entertained.</p></body></html>

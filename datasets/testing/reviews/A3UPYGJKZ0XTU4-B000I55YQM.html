Screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris have updated and rewritten this paranoid thriller for today's political climate. When Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) led a reconnaissance mission into Iraqi-controlled territory in 1991, his unit was attacked, two men lost, Marco was injured, and a Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) emerged a hero, after he fought off the enemy and guided his unit to safety. Over a decade later, Congressman Raymond Shaw is pursuing a very upwardly mobile political career at the urging of his controlling, ambitious mother, Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep). A visit from a former Desert Storm comrade causes Ben Marco to suspect that his frequent nightmares of brainwashing, torture, and murder may contain clues to what happened to him and his men all those years ago, as well as information vital to the integrity of our political system, considering that Raymond Shaw has just received a Vice Presidential nomination.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate"'s themes are powerful and provocative, but the narrative is so far-fetched that they don't hit home. That might also be said of the 1962 version of the story as well, but the emotional impact of these characters isn't enough to overwhelm the film's implausibility. There was no reason to make the technologies of mind manipulation so laughable or so prominent. The character of Raymond Shaw is kind of creepy and so unstable that he's not credible. A neuroscientist is introduced out of nowhere to help Ben, but he seems to exist in a vacuum for no other purpose. It's difficult to tell if all of this brainwashing was done to advance the cause of corporate ambition or political tyranny. Politics makes strange bedfellows, but demonizing two separate parties, neither of which would need to result to such tactics, is confusing if the film is trying to make a socio-political statement -which I think it is.<br /><br />I have to compliment Meryl Streep's performance, though. Eleanor Prentiss Shaw is a thoroughly detestable individual whose self-possession and sharp tongue make her charismatic nonetheless...and easily the most interesting character in this film. She's an ambitious ideologue who will stop at nothing to see that her country conforms to her vision. Streep's performance reveals both the character's commitment and the dangers of her fanaticism. Streep claims to have modeled Eleanor Shaw's manner on a real person, whom I assume to be Senator Hilary Clinton. That is not to say that Senator Clinton is villainous, but that her career and disposition superficially resemble those of Shaw. The interesting thing is that the two women are on opposite sides of the political spectrum.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate" is mostly fluff. It's a passable thriller that requires a little too much suspension of disbelief. Apart from that, its themes are poorly articulated. -Except in the character of Eleanor Shaw, the Senator from hell. Viewers will either love her or hate her. Or maybe both sides of the political spectrum will see an ugly reflection of themselves in her. Her ideals and her methods are insightful, provocative and perfectly realized by Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 5 deleted and extended scenes, 2 outtakes in which Eleanor Shaw is being interviewed by the press, a Liev Schreiber screen test, some discussion by amateur political pundits, and an audio commentary by director Jonathan Demme and co-screenwriter Daniel Pyne. "The Enemy Within" (15 minutes) is a making-of documentary that features interviews with the director, producers, writer, and cast in which they compare the film to the book and discuss the film's conception. "The Cast of the Manchurian Candidate" (12 minutes) explores the three main characters: Ben, Raymond, and Eleanor and includes interviews with the actors who play them. "Liev Schreiber Screen Test" (3 minutes) is the scene in which Raymond asks his mother to help Ben. "Political Pundits" (10 minutes) includes three conversations, each between two people, about a loose socio-political topic: Beau Sia and Roy Blunt, Jr. discuss voting in America. Fab 5 Freddy and Anna Deavere Smith discuss "gangsterism". And Sidney Lumet and Reno discuss American power and a disinterested electorate. The audio commentary by Jonathan Demme and Daniel Pyne addresses the decisions made in writing the script and in constructing the film. Demme and Pyne occasionally discuss the film's relationship to current events or give background information on the script, but the commentary is mostly about writing and directing. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

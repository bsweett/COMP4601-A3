<meta name="summary" content="A top notch Crime-Drama, with a Tarantino twist."></head><body><p>Reservior Dogs is the story of a perfect crime thrown into chaos by a criminal who is really an undercover cop. The robbery gets botched, a lot of people die, the remaining theives regroup at the rendevous point to wait for their leader, and try to smoke out which one of them is the rat. (I guess this film proves that old saw: There is no honor among theives.) Simple plot, wonderful execution. <p>  Writer/Director/Actor Quentin Tarantino serves up some great dialogue and plot twists, and the Actors (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn, &amp; Steve Buscemi) are all at the top of their games. <p>  The only thing keeping this film from a perfect 5 is the same beef I had when I saw it all those years ago: Without giving anything away, I'll just say this- I don't care if a sting will nab Hitler, Manson, Atilla the Hun and The Devil all at once, no Police Officer is going to stand by and do nothing while another Officer, or Two, (or the Cilivians in the Jewelry store) are ruthlessly slaughtered. Too far-fetched. But if you can suspend the disbelief for 90 minutes, this IS a great film.<p>  The DVD has Widescreen format on one side, standard on the other, and really has no extras except for the trailer and some interesting production notes. <p>  Just as a word of warning: the DVD comes with a little ad touting the &quot;Reservoir Dogs 10th Anniversary Collectors Edition DVD&quot; coming this June, so if you're looking for extras, you might want to wait until then.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A really good action thriller"></head><body><p>The transporter has unique hand-to-hand and driving combat skills derived from years in the army's Special Forces and many combat missions. He usually takes dangerous delivery jobs that others are unable or afraid to do. He drives an armored vehicle. However, in this film, he agrees to substitute for a friend who can't drive a youngster from place to place. He and the boy bond. He promises the child that he would make sure that he is never hurt. Very soon he has to use his skills and fulfill his promise when the boy is kidnapped.<br /><br /> The film is filled with action. There are many chases, by speed boat, cars, and foot, among others, including one where he rushes a plane while driving in a car. There are many fights; several where the transporter battles about a dozen armed men while he is unarmed and alone, and a fight with a woman. There is humor in the film, as when the boy's mother, who likes him, says, "I didn't know that you had a friend." He replies, "He's no friend. He's French." This Frenchman plays a part in the movie and adds humor.<br /><br /> The film is filled with suspense. Why is the boy kidnapped? Why is his father so distant from him? Will the relationship between his father and mother be resolved? Can the transporter rescue the boy? Can he save the people who the kidnappers want to hurt? People who enjoy action films will really delight in this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sin City: A Feast For The Comic Book Geeks?  Yes & No."></head><body><p>Are Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez comic book geeks?  Yeah.  Bigtime.  Is it any wonder that they were able to talk the hesitant Frank Miller into making his pulp comic dynasty Sin City into a movie?  Porbably not.  They tried awfully hard and Rodriguez first treatment did make a pretty impressive splash with creator Miller.  Hence, a comic book movie is born.<br /><br />Probably the first comic book movie.<br /><br />Sure there's Batman and Superman and X-Men and Spider-Man and blah-de-blah-blah.  But one:  None of these movies were filmed by Tarrantino and Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Two: These movies were adaptions of comics turned into movies.  Sin City is a comic book turned into a comic book movie.  Hard to explain....unless you've seen it.  Miller is a great artist (he worked on the Marvel Limited series of Wolverine in the mid-80's) and he has a certain vision.  Rodriguez did not want this to be Frank Miller's Sin City as portrayed by Robert Rodriguez.  He wanted Frank Miller's Sin City.  Period.<br /><br />I think he got that and a helluva lot more.<br /><br />Do you need to be a Comic Book Geek to love this movie?  No.  It would help.  But it wouldn't be a prerequisite.  In fact, after viewing the movie, on having liked it, you may have a new-found appreciation of comics in general.<br /><br />To cut to the chase.  This is a dark and unseemly movie with dark and unseemly subject matter.  It moves like a hurricane.<br /><br />Dig it.</p></body></html>

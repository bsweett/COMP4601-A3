<meta name="summary" content="SCORSESE PULLS OFF PREDICTABLE TWIST"></head><body><p>In 1954, U.S. Marshal Edward "Teddy" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), go to the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. They are assigned there to investigate the disappearance of a female patient who apparently disappeared from a locked room. The chief psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), explains that she was committed after drowning her three children.<br /><br />The Marshals run up against one wall after another in their investigation including the refusal by Cawley to turn over patient files and a generally uncooperative staff that includes Max Von Sydow as Dr. Naehring, another psychiatrist.  Daniels and Naehring quickly form an intense dislike of one another as Naehring is German and Daniels was part of a U.S. Army battalion that liberated the infamous Dachau Death Camp during World War II.  As a storm prevents the Marshals from returning to the mainland, Teddy begins to lose a grip on his own reality, having flashbacks to the horrific images at the death camp and suffering debilitating headaches.  He is determined to get to the island's lighthouse, convinced that it may hold the key to the mystery despite having been told that the guards have already searched it.  The mystery only deepens when the escaped patient is miraculously found.<br /><br />Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is based on Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel of the same name.  Lehane also wrote Mystic River and Gone, Baby Gone, which has some of the same elements as Shutter Island.  What strikes you first is the amazing visuals and the foreboding atmosphere of Ashecliff.  Built atop the rocky island off Boston, part of the facility had formerly been used as a fort during the Civil War.  It hints of the gothic castles and mansion from old Universal Studios horror films.  The island quakes with thunder and lightning, jolting you off the comfy confines of your sofa.<br /><br />Scorsese positions Cawley and Naehring as sinister forces, purposely keeping the Marshals at bay to deep their dark secrets hidden.  Daniels and Aule soon theorize that the facility might have a more ominous purpose.  The pair scurry about like rats in a maze, checking every corner but making little progress in their investigation.<br /><br />Scorsese indulges himself a little too much with the scenery, liberally borrowing bits from noir films and even cannibalizing some of his own films like Cape Fear.  The many flashbacks to Daniels' experiences during the war only serve to reveal Scorsese's hole card much too soon.  About halfway through the film you think there's no way that it can be going down THIS path with a twist that has been done all too frequently in other recent thriller/horror films.  Despite this near fatal flaw, Scorsese manages to pull it all together in the end.<br /><br />DiCaprio gives a solid performance, even if he does look silly in his fedora.  You can feel his growing unease every step of the way. The show stealer is Kingsley whose character combines equal parts creepy and campy.  The fine supporting cast includes Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, and Ted Levine.<br /><br />Despite some of its flaws, Shutter Island is a worthwhile view thanks to its nightmarish imagery and strong performances.</p></body></html>

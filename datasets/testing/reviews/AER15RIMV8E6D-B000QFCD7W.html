<meta name="summary" content="Perfect Comedy!!!"></head><body><p>This is an awesome comedy, because it has a lot of great actors like Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, John Travolta, and William H. Macy! 4 middle-aged friends named Doug, Bobby, Dudley, and Woody want to 'get away from it all' and go on a road trip on their Harley-Davidsons. A lot of hilarious situations happen such as the men skinny dipping, and a family want to join them. Later, they have to deal with a motorcycle gang called the Del Fuegos. The Del Fuegos become mad when Woody accidentally burns down their bar. The Wild Hogs seek comfort in a small town called Madrid. Dudley falls in love with Maggie, the owner of a restaurant. The Del Feugos come to Madrid wanting revenge. The Wild Hogs decide to stand up for the town and fight back. If you love comedy, you'll love WILD HOGS!!!</p></body></html>

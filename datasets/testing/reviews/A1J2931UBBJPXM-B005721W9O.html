For four years it was a hit show, the crew of the NSEA ship  "Protector" keeping the Universe safe on a weekly basis; then it was  canceled.  Now, twenty years later, actor Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), better  known as Commander Peter Quincy Taggert, and four other members of his  "crew" are on the convention circuit.  When he is approached by a small  contingent of aliens (they've taken on human form, or course) at "Quest  18," he understandably looks upon them as just so many more obsessed fans.  The next day, however, they show up at his home; soon Jason is aboard their  ship in deep space, where he discovers that their entire civilization,  apparently, is based upon the "Historical documents" (weekly episodes) of  "Galaxy Quest" they've intercepted over the air waves.  They also have the  real technology by which they are capable of inter-galactic space travel,  and have built an actual version of the "Protector."  What they lack is  leadership; a true Commander.  They simply do not possess the wherewithal  to oppose the aggression of the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) who is  threatening the very existence of their race.  Jason returns to earth to  gather the rest of his crew, and they're off to "negotiate" with Sarris;  Jason being the only one who knows that it's all real.  The others agree to  come along only because they think Jason has scored a good gig and they  don't want to be left out.  After all, work is work;  you take what you can  get.  It takes a number of things to make a movie like this work, not  the least of which is the right cast; and this one more than fits the bill.  Tim Allen lends just the right amount of bravura and ego to make his Jason  believable, while demonstrating the restraint needed to prevent him from  becoming overblown into a mere caricature.  Alan Rickman is perfect as the  dour British thespian, Sir Alexander Dane, who portrayed the Spock-like Dr.  Lazarus in the show, as is Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco), the actress who  had little else to do on the show but look good.  Tony Shalhoub (Fred  Kwan), imbues his character with a singular eccentricity which adds that  "something extra" that makes him so memorable, and Daryl Mitchell (Tommy  Webber) is engaging as the pilot who finally gets to do it for real (and  much to his chagrin, initially).  But the versatile Sam Rockwell (Guy  Fleegman) very nearly steals the show as the actor who only appeared in  "Episode 81" as "Crewman #6" (and was killed off before the first  commercial), and who is thrilled to finally be one of the "crew."  At least  until things start going for real much as they did in that fatal (for him)  episode 81.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Patrick Breen (Quellek),  Missi Pyle (Laliari), Jed Rees (Teb), Justin Long (Brandon), and Enrico  Colantoni, who does an especially fine job of bringing Mathesar, the leader  of the aliens, to life.  Parisot must be given credit for not  resorting to slapstick nor playing the comedy too broadly here, either of  which could easily have been an option with a project like this (and would  have been to the detriment of the film).  Instead he has taken an  intelligent (and very funny) screenplay and made the most of it.  The  timing is excellent, and the action tight.  Writers David Howard and Robert  Gordon have sprinkled detailed bits throughout the film, with which Star  Trek fans especially will be able to identify, and they have managed to  capture the look and "feel" of the original Star Trek series, particularly  in the scene which takes place on the alien planet.  "Star Trek" may have  been the main course, but now "Galaxy Quest" is the delicious dessert; and,  as such, it will keep you coming back for more.  This is a movie you will  want to watch over and over again, without ever tiring of it.  As Commander  Taggert would say, "Never give up, never surrender."</p></body></html>

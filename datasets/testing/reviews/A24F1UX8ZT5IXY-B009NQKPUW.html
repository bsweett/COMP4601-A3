<meta name="summary" content="Shows its weaknesses on video."></head><body><p>When I saw Prometheus in the theater, I thought it messed with the entire mythos of Alien, and pretty much undermined most of that amazing film -- but that Ridley Scott had crafted a science fiction experience unlike any other in years. It was quite mesmerizing to watch, and anything that has to do with discovering hyper-advanced Alien technology is sure to have me hypnotized  -- and there's a lot of that here.<br /><br />But take away the set pieces and this thing is a cobbled-together mess of a film. Not only is it totally new-agey, but it comes across as a juvenile recreation of 2001; the visual cues and themes are all over the place. And we all know that Scott loves Kubrick (just check out The Duellists). The plot winds up pulling some pretty clever tricks out of its hat with its total re-imagining of the Alien universe, and I think it should be given credit for some brilliant ideas particularly regarding the development of the species.<br /><br />But for me where the wheels come off is with the characters. Aside from the outstanding performance and subtext to Michael Fassbender's character (David), no one else in the film is anything better than standard Hollywood fare. Noomi Rapace is okay, but Charlize Theron is positively godawful and Guy Pearce is poorly misused.  The rest of the crew is totally throw-away, and as many other have pointed out, only seem to exist to serve the plot contrivances.<br /><br />So on the positive end of the spectrum you have some of the greatest, jaw-dropping (and thrilling) effects work in years taking place on a planet light years from earth, involving Alien technology, mutated viruses and androids -- while on the other end are weak characters, a gimmicky plot, and an underdeveloped metaphysical theme. Not the first time for Scott with that. The first film said everything that needed to be said, and only had to hint at the larger and more frightening aspects of the material. The biblical allegories are all over the place here -- just look at what he's saying about the development of the planet itself.</p></body></html>

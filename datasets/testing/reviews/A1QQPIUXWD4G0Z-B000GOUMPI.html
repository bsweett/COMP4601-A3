<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Macabre Adaptation of King's Classic"></head><body><p>This 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's novel by Stanley Kubrick is a masterpiece in the macabre with outstanding performances by all involved.<br /><br />Kubrick's story follows King's setting of the Overlook Hotel perched high on the Rockies and set on what used to be an Indian burial grounds.  Jack Nicholson is hired to be the caretaker in the winter season which he hopes will encourage his writing while his wife (Duvall) and son (Lloyd) stay with him.  But the spirit world is alive and well coming to torment his son and possess him (Nicholson) to do horrible things to his family.<br /><br />Unlike most Hollywood shock horror, Kubrick uses wide shots of empty halls and high mountains to add to the feeling of isolation.  An eerie sense of the occult is felt by the playing of a synthesized 'Kyrie' mass and Bartok for incidental music.  The absence of violence in most of the film is replaced by eerie images of ghosts or awkward juxtapositions that defy common sense.  The acting of Jack Nicholson is the main attraction and this is by far one of his best performances on film: I don't see how Kubrick could have chosen a better actor for the part.<br /><br />Although some have complained how Kubrick deviated from King's story: that was the best thing that could be done.  Apart from his short stories, King is not that great at writing long novels such as 'The Shining' particularly in closing his stories.  The movies in which King was directly involved were all flops primarily because of him.  Don't be dissuaded by such reviews and see this great thriller for yourselves: you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

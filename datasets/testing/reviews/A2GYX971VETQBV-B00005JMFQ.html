<meta name="summary" content="The Mother of All Romantic Comedies"></head><body><p>I will be the first to admit that I don't really like romantic comedies all that much.  They tug at our heart strings, make us sick to our stomachs, and leave us dripping in sacharine sweetness.  LOVE ACTUALLY is no exception to the mix.  In fact, this film seems to be a romantic comedy on steroids, combining the Hollywood happiness of several movies into a single extravaganza.  Throughout the film, we are treated to many interweaving storylines of love.<br /><br />Although I found the film to be a bit too sweet for my tooth, I did enjoy watching the storylines overlap one another and I was entertained.  Despite the film's length, I found myself interested in a couple of the storylines in particular..like that  of Billy Mack, a cynical rock star who steals every scene he is in.<br /><br />LOVE ACTUALLY is neither a great film nor a terrible one.  It is an average film.  No more, no less.  Not worth a buy...but perhaps a look.</p></body></html>

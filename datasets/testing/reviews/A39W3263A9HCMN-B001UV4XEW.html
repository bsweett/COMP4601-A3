<meta name="summary" content="Finally, I lived to see a good American comedy!"></head><body><p>The problem with a lot of American comedy is that they usually start off really funny and then soon plateau after 15 minutes. Of recent memory, the only good American comedies I've seen this year would be this, Observe and Report, Pineapple Express, the indie sleeper hit Zach and Miri Make a Porno (heavily underrated), and I Love You Man. Land of the Lost was pure poison, Step Brothers is a complete waste of film, Beer in Hell, as much as the book was funny, is one I will not see and looks like it has the production values of a Jan Terri music video.<br /><br />I was not expecting this to be that great. I had seen the trailer with Observe and Report (which I LOVED) and thought it was funny, but it looked like one I should wait till it comes out on Blu-Ray. However, midway into July, I managed to get ahold of a screener copy of the movie through a friend. So my family and I sat on the couch and watched it together.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised by how good it was! I mean, I was expecting another run of the mill, brash and rude and crude comedy. But no, this film was pure epic comedy at its best. Hell, I hate to commit blasephemy but this movie is really up there with comedy classics like Dr. Strangelove and There's Something About Mary. In fact, it may be the new TSAM. Here you have a fairly uncommon cast with a few surprises, including the gorgeously hot Heather Grahm, and even a cameo from the champ boxer Mike Tyson himself! Don't worry, no ears get bitten off here.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MFNB4E">The Midnight Meat Train</a>'s Bradley Cooper, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MOV9W">Semi-Pro</a>'s Ed Helms, Comedian Zach Gilifonakis and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013BM6JI">National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets</a>' Justin Bartha all star in this hilarious comedy about a group of four guys going to Vegas for one of their's bachelor party. They have an awesome night... except they wake up with their room trashed, Mike Tyson's tiger in their bathroom, and no memory of what happens. What comes for the next 2 days includes getting arrested, finding out one was married, losing money, and more!!! Even worse, the team has been reduced to 3, because one has disappeared! Now they have to continue this horrible weekend no matter what it takes to get through... and make it to the wedding!<br /><br />Let's face it, this movie is the ultimate comedy of the 2000s. I thought Superbad was a hell of an epic comedy! Well, not so much after seeing The Hangover. THe Hangover is a brilliant comedy that not only makes you laugh, but relates to real life too- people spend their lives unnecessarily getting drunk. There are tons of belly laughs, lots of WTF moments, great performances from the stellar cast, and a comedy experiences that will leave you talking about if for months to come.<br /><br />So if you haven't seen this, it's not too late to see it yet. I reccommend it- Finally some GOOD american humor! I haven't seen Zombieland, but I intend to eventually- apparently this and Zombieland re the two best comedies of 09. So go see The Hangover now!!!</p></body></html>

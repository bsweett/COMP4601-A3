<meta name="summary" content="Impressive Complexity and Beauty Packed into a Cloistered Four-Character Drama."></head><body><p>"Doubt" is an adaptation of the acclaimed theatrical play by John Patrick Stanley, set in a small Catholic school in 1964, as the nation and Church are poised for great social change. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a friendly, easy-going man who teaches the boys basketball at the St. Nicholas School and gives the 8th graders light-hearted advice on their nascent social lives. The school's principal, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), is a humorless disciplinarian suspicious of Flynn's outgoing disposition and progressive ideas. Those suspicions infect a kindly young nun, Sister James (Amy Adams), who reports some unusual behavior of the school's first and only black student (Joseph Foster) after a private meeting with Father Flynn. That's enough to convince Sister Aloysius that Flynn is a child molester who must be driven out.<br /><br />John Patrick Stanley took inspiration from the Catholic school he attended as a child in the Bronx and a nun of the Sisters of Charity who was a favorite teacher. He adapted the play for the screen himself and also directs the film. I wondered if this might result in a movie that looks like a play on film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the its beauty. Roger Deacons' cinematography makes an impression immediately, while the opening credits are still rolling. He has created many striking shots, including some unexpected canted shots that don't seem unnatural or self-conscious. "Doubt" is still a film whose action takes place in conversations between its characters; it's not visually dynamic. But it is visually captivating -much  moreso than I expected from a film that is about the interactions between four people in one location.<br /><br />The secret of "Doubt"'s success may be that it is perceived differently by different people. I don't think there is agreement on what it's all about. At first the audience wonders if Father Flynn is guilty of misconduct. Eventually, we don't care, because so many other interesting questions have been raised. People are not what we expected and not what they expected of each other. There is a lot going on in the minds of these characters, and that's where the story lies. The idea of "doubt" is curious, because Sister Aloysius never has proof of anything; she only has her certainty. She banishes doubt, because she is incapable of acting without certainty. Many people wouldn't sweat the doubts so much in condemning their enemy.<br /><br />Is it acceptable to stray from the values that we claim to espouse in the pursuit of justice? Are we to condemn people for what they do or for what they are? "Doubt" raises a host of contemporary issues in a confined period drama. The most amazing thing it does is to introduce a third perspective, just when we're thinking that the battle is between Sister Aloysius' obsessive intolerance and Father Flynn's conspicuous kindness. The perspective is that of the boy's mother, Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), who turns everything upside down in just one scene. I laughed out loud at Sister Aloysius' reaction: "This will not do." The actors pack so much into their performances. "Doubt" is a thought-provoking film and a bit of a chameleon.<br /><br />The DVD ( Miramax 2009): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. "From Stage to Screen" (19 min) interviews John Patrick Stanley about his inspiration for the play and adapting it for the screen, as well as the actors and production designer David Gropman. "The Cast of Doubt" (14 min) is an interview of the principle cast by Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly. In "Scoring Doubt" (4 1/2 min), composer Howard Shore and Shanley talk about the music. "Sisters of Charity" (6 1/2 min) interviews 4 nuns from the Sisters of Charity order, including the woman who inspired the Sister James character, about their lifestyle then and now.  The audio commentary by John Patrick Shanley talks a great deal about the time and place in which the story takes place. He also offers some information on visual decisions, sets, and filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

The lineup was incredible, consisting of such voices as Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Steve Irwin.  Robin Williams was actually the voice of two characters. Well, the things that stand out to me from this movie most are first of all spectacular visuals, and then good music.  It also had a creative storyline and an unexpected twist at the end, which was a nice surprise.  Furthermore, I liked that there was the theme of being different that in the end turned out to be their salvation.  In a way, Mumble the outcast turned out to be a real hero, their savior of sorts.  He really had a knack for tap dancing, and as you may see, the talent comes in very handy.  The baby penguins were adorable, and very hard not to like.  The Leopard Seal evasion sequence was very exciting, and so was the Killer Whale scene.  All in all Happy Feet is a fun film and I am happy to have added it to my movie collection.  I would call it a "family" film except for the suggestive lyrics in one of the songs by Prince called "Kiss".  The lyrics go "You don't have to be beautiful, to turn me on... I just need your body baby, from dusk till dawn".  Other than that, this movie is suitable for kids too.  One can easily overlook those lyrics when weighing in the overall benefit and enjoyment potential from such a film.  If you have young kids, it's your call. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

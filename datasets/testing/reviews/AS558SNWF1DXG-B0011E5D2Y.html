<meta name="summary" content=""Never leave a fellow crasher behind!"  (3.5 stars)"></head><body><p>By now, their onscreen personas are firmly established.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn gravitates to playing slick, amusingly arrogant motor-mouths. Impossibly tall and hyper, he often resembles a chatty, severely hung-over stork.<br /><br />Owen Wilson usually portrays talkative characters, too, but he goes in the opposite direction. Laid-back but always a little shifty, he's like a slightly baked sheepdog.<br /><br />They make a good comedic duo and, as "Wedding Crashers" opens, they're Maryland divorce mediators trying to finesse an amicable split between an acrimonious couple.<br /><br />Finally, the ex-husband-to-be (Dwight Yoakam) wearily compromises provided the guys "just stop talking."<br /><br />But Jeremy (Vaughn) and John (Wilson) do talk a great game, and on weekends they like to schmooze their way into weddings to take advantage of the free food, booze and merriment. The nuptial atmosphere also seems to make women more susceptible to their come-ons and to lines such as, "True love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another," ... which actually is a pretty nice thought.<br /><br />The first third of "Crashers" follows the aging boys through a season of weddings, receptions and R-rated high-jinx, but just as the guys begin to lose interest in their scam, John falls for a bride's sister and Jeremy gets tangled up with a clingy flake he can't shake. The women, who are sisters, lure them to a seaside estate for a weekend with their family, a gang of nut jobs presided over by Christopher Walken (who, in the realm of actor/animal metaphors, has successfully patented himself as an intimidating iguana).<br /><br />If you've seen the previews, you know the drill. All the jokes in the ads are there - and a lot more - and the movie is good.<br /><br />The problem is, given the film's can't-miss premise and its extremely funny leads, "Crashers" should be almost great and it isn't. Some obvious problems bog it down.<br /><br />It's surprisingly long, a minute under two hours and, funny as it is, it feels long. No comedy about guys who crash weddings should stretch very far past 90 minutes; I mean, even "War of the Worlds" wrapped itself up in less time and that was about, well, a war of the worlds.<br /><br />Also, the movie's villain (Bradley Cooper, who plays Wilson's unfortunately named rival, Sack) is such a violent, hotheaded tool, he drains a lot of the fun out of the story. In a comedy, even the bad guy needs to be at least a little funny, but this one just doles out beatings, insults and creepy glares. By the end, I wanted to see Sack torn apart by carnivorous apes which - hate to spoil it - is not how "Crashers" ends.<br /><br />The movie is kind of all over the place, too. This is the first film in recent memory in which a genuinely touching scene about burgeoning love is stuck between a gag about bondage and footage of a guy vomiting into a toilet.<br /><br />Despite all its strange quirks and some sappiness at the end, though, "Crashers" hits much more often than it misses. I laughed a lot (Vaughn's confession to a priest - played by Henry Gibson, no less - is the funniest scene I've seen this year). I only wish the opening and closing credits were a little closer together.</p></body></html>

Soon after this a mysterious breeze hits New York, specifically Central Park where people start to kill themselves (one lady even jabs a pen into her neck) and from then on it seems clear that the planet is quite unhappy with how people have been and are currently treating it so why not create something that causes us to lose our will to live.<br /><br />Elliot and his somewhat jaded wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel, "(500) Days of Summer") along with a few others try to escape to safety and stay alive despite all this chaos. They go through the nearby countryside where Elliot keeps trying to find ways to simply explain what is happening to the planet and why people are doing what they're doing. The pro-earth propaganda just is sickening, the story is just plain silly, no scares, not good acting by anyone, people just run off and do their own thing which is usually the dumbest thing. Like when Elliot's friend Julian (John Leguizamo, "Moulin Rouge") goes into the city to get his loved ones despite knowing he has no chance to make it, once a hole is punctured in the roof of the car, the bad air gets in and soon after he thankfully off's himself.<br /><br />Watching this load of you know what from director M. Night Shyamalan is just so hard to endure. Shyamalan has made good movies like "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable" and even "Signs" wasn't too bad, however he's also made bad, bad flicks like "The Village" and "The Last Airbender". "The Happening" falls into a whole new category of bad, its another of the movies that's on a list of ones I totally loathe and hate.<br /><br />Its not a smart, clever flick, its boring, badly paced, really poorly written and really makes the viewer lose their will to live, or maybe that's just how I felt while watching it. 1/2 out of 4 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Reverent portrayal of very recent events"></head><body><p>The mood of this film is very careful, reverent, and poised, much like Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II. It plays out patiently over a very emotional issue for many people around the world: the death of Princess Diana and the reaction of the English monarchy.<br /><br />Peter Morgan's script does an excellent job of presenting all sides of an historical moment. It never feels as if he's trying to garner sympathy for any parties involved. We see the queen trying to deal with the situation in the way that she sees fit: the most traditional, nonreactionary, unemotional way. We see Tony Blair trying to convince her that this is not the proper way to proceed. We see the public's reaction to Diana's death.<br /><br />What struck me the most about the film was how the power of the media was displayed. In numerous scenes, the prime minister is shown scanning the headlines for the public's reactions. The queen is shown watching news reports of people's reactions. When Tony Blair attempts to side with the Queen slightly and help her the newspapers don't report it, they continue to report the queen's lack of action. To me, this brought into the equation the very real idea that while the government may rule, the media can decide what to say about events, and therefore effect public opinion in a much more direct way.<br /><br />This film moves slowly, but is never boring. It definitely opens up many topics of conversation. This was a very well thought out and executed film.</p></body></html>

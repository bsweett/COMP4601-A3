<meta name="summary" content="Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?"></head><body><p>The second Harry Potter film begins as Harry and Ron fly a magic car to Hogwarts School, join their pal Hermione, and begin their second year of wizarding studies. They meet their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the celebrated wizard hero, Gilderoy Lockhart, but he may not be all he claims to be. Several people are attacked and petrified, and the culprit is "the heir of Slytherin" who controls a monster that lives in the "Chamber of Secrets." As Harry tries to solve this mystery, he encounters giant spiders, a monstrous serpent, and he even faces a 16-year old Lord Voldemort in a finale that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe shines as 12-year old Harry, the orphan-hero, and he emerges as a real screen star.  He is much more confident and an all-round better actor than he was in the first movie. Rupert Grint (Ron) gets all the funny lines and proves himself a clever sidekick.  Emma Watson (Hermione) has a  smaller part this time, but is also very comfortable in front of the camera. Jason Isaacs plays the villain you love to hate, Lucius Malfoy.  I wish we saw more of him and of Kenneth Branaugh as the very funny Professor Lockhart.<br /><br />Harry Potter fans are sure to enjoy this installment, although it may be too scary for those under 7. If you like action-packed plots and really good special effects, you will not be disappointed.  The DVD includes hours of fun that includes  deleted scenes, interviews, and games.</p></body></html>

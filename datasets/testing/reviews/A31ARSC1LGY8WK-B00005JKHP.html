<meta name="summary" content="Colorless, uninteresting resumption of the Star Trek legacy"></head><body><p>Take an original Star Trek episode and draw it out to three times the usual length, take away the humor, throw in some post-Star wars special effects, and finally add in some uninteresting new characters, and there you have it "Star Trek - The Motion Picture".<br />Admittedly there is some initial fun in seeing the old crew back after a ten year hiatus but this fun drains away pretty quickly. Long, boring and colorless - right down to the drab production design - even fans will struggle to sit through this one. You get the feeling that director Robert Wise was so conscious of being respectful of the material that he ended up embalming it. If this review is not warning enough, this film has been recut twice all to no avail.</p></body></html>

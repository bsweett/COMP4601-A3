What an utterly dull, dreary and dissapointing film. Night often has very original ideas, but the story telling/plot become so misguided and hard to folow,and/or try to be artsy or surreal its just a bit hard to follow what he is trying to get accross.Perhaps he is smarter than all of us(me included) and he is a genius director and I am just too dimwitted to comprehend his films?However, Lady in the water moved terribly slow.It was painful. This film had about 10 minutes of my attention,and then "it just lost me."I know it was a "mythical" plot but it had become so misguided, by the time it finally came to an end I just didn't give a damm anymore.Paul Giamatti is a fantastic actor(one of my favorites), and was really the only one who shined in this film,if at all. All the other "charaters were just "fillers".Making a film that is a fairy tale for adults, but trying to make the adults "the childen" is a bit of a stretch.I understand ultimately this was a "seek your purpose in the world" message and to believe in things that are generally taught to us not to believe in,because we grow up and turn into borring adults. That's all fine a good, and it was a decent idea to being with,but perhaps M. Night Shamalan should not make films of his rough drafts and actually edit and re-write the screenplays a few times before just thinking,"hey,this is a cool idea" and just make a film based on a catchy title or a page of notes that look like chicken scratch.Whatever it was he was trying to do with Lady in the water, it somehow got lost and just turned out to be a very poorly executed film and it shows terribly. I only hope that Night stops following the the film practices of other directors who had one hit wonders(and/or trillogies) and has some reflection on his dircting and screen writing practices for future projects.</p></body></html>

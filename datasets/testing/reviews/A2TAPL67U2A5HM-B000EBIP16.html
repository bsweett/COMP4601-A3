The special effects are amazing and the music likewise. The movie is very faithful to the novel and only diverges at small parts. The Christian allegory is everywhere to be found. Aslan as the savior, Lucy and Susan being the women at the cross and so many more. Truly an amazing movie that should be enjoyed by fantasy movie lovers of all ages. I very much enjoyed it. Highly recommended. 5/5.</p></body></html>

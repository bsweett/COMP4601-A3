<meta name="summary" content="Several version floating around"></head><body><p>The basic story is of a telephone line repairman (Richard Dreyfuss) who encounters a UFO and has trouble relating this to his wife (Teri Garr); she is in denial and refuses to entertain the thought that there may be UFOs. There are parallel stories of other people encountering UFO's. Eventually the government is also contacted by the UFOs and sets up a meeting with them had a unique location. The individuals encountered have also been compelled to attend; this to the government's consternation. Will the other invitees make it to the rendezvous point? What trials and tribulations must they endure on the way?<br /><br /> The lighter version, "The Collector's Edition" (ASIN: 0767827031) of the film. This is closer to the original cut but still not the one shown on TV.  I bought this version after I realized I had the darker version. Amazon.com did the research for me<br /><br />The dark version, also called "The Collector's Edition" However I think it was supposed to be a director's cut (ASIN: 0800198395) cut out all the comic scenes like the throwing all the dirt in the window prior to building the replica of Devils Mountain. And added some "Mother gets disturbed scenes." I bought the dark version first because I thought it had the special ending where the inside of the ship is shown. But I did not know that it was completely remade. Some of the Gas mask scenes are missing also.<br /><br />If this review ends up on another version you will have to check for your self how complete it really is and what has been cut out.<br /><br />Other than that if you did not see the original or the third version that is shown periodically on TV you would like this movie and it is worth the purchase price.<br />-----------------------------------------------<br />Well now I do not want to mix media with a review that is for the movie however a later contribution with the advent of Blu-ray is the two DVD "30th Anniversary Ultimate" editions which seems to have picked up some original material missing from all the tapes. Again I am not trying to distract from the movie content but this edition show that (probably due to this being a movie from the pre-blu-ray era) some scenes are clear and almost three dimensional while others are very grainy and of poor focus. Once you get into the story this distraction will go away.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767827031">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECACG">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UFZK">Poltergeist (25th Anniversary Edition)</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still one of the great film of any era"></head><body><p>After seeing "Prometheus" earlier it seemed appropriate to catch this classic again.  Some of the shots of computer visuals and sounds are quaint, given the technology advances since 1979.  Putting that aside, "Alien" holds up as one of the great science fiction/horror films of all time.  It is also director Ridley Scott's earliest masterpiece.<br /><br />Returning on a routine cargo hauling mission, the 7 man crew of the Nostromo is woken up from hibernation with a directive to investigate a signal coming from a nearby moon. Lead by Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), they investigate and find the remains of a huge humanoid figure at the controls of an unusual space ship.  They also discover a slimy substance oozing from a cluster of pod-like elements.  One attaches to the face plate of the second in command, Kane (John Hurt).<br /><br />Once back at the ship, efforts to remove the creature are stymied but it soon disappears only to reappear bursting out Kane in the now iconic scene.  The remainder of the film focuses on the crew's efforts to jettison the creature.  Scott takes great pains to inject chair-gripping suspense as the now growing creature remains mostly hidden from view.  As one of the great film characters, Sigourney Weaver catapults to stardom (and 3 sequels) as Ripley, 3rd in command.  After watching this movie countless times, the tension remains even having memorized the scenes.  Truly one of my favorite films.<br /><br />This film was seen as part of the Blu ray "Alien Anthology" collection.  The film has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is transferred in 1080p.  The soundtrack is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The video is an improvement over the DVD, but does retain the grain of the original film.  It is sharp, has appropriate color saturation and hues.  Excellent.  The sound is demo quality.  Perfect.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great story line, First Class acting by Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey Jr."></head><body><p>Unlike other reviews that felt the movie was a bit too long, I felt that the pacing fit perfectly with all the principals investigative skills and the fantastic and engrossing acting abilities of Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Elias Koteas. You feel the tension, pain, confusion and frustration these [investigators], both police and journalist experienced through their investigation(s) of this infamous murder suspect. Brian Cox played a short but admirable part as Attorney Melvin Belli; who's office I once had the pleasure of "visiting", picking up legal documents as a process server in the City of San Francisco. What a character he was. And what a great group of good-looking "female legal assistants" he had in that office.<br /><br />The more I watch such top-notch acting jobs performed by these stars, the more I appreciate how much work and effort they put into their jobs that sometimes make you feel like they're the real characters and not acting. Superb Directing by David Fincher.<br /><br />What a great movie. I live right next to San Francisco (Daly City) and was in high school when these killings started. They were the talk of the town. One of the best murder-suspense movies ever made.</p></body></html>

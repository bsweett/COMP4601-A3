<meta name="summary" content="The nightclub scene is the best."></head><body><p>Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a film that actually works even though the premise is outrageous. This is probably Cruise's best performance ever! Who knew he could play such a seedy character. Foxx was nominated for best supporting actor, he is pretty good in this even though he is not my cup of tea. The only thing wrong with this film is the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith, jeez that woman cannot act worth a dime! This film isn't perfect but it's pretty close thanks to director Michael Mann.</p></body></html>

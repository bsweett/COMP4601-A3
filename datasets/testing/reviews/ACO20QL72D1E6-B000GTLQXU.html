<meta name="summary" content="POSEIDON? WATCHABLE"></head><body><p>but compared to the 1972 classic, it sadly lacks the star power...  When disaster hits the almost Titanic of a new luxury liner, the remake surpasses the original a long way.<br /><br />The demise of the ship in the end is also a scene that parallells the 1997-epic about a certain ship - as a matter of fact - some scenes even surpasses THAT 1...<br /><br />Josh Lucas  is good as a human being... not good... not evil...  but something in between:-)) Richard Dreyfuss is good as well...<br /><br />The rest of the cast suffers because they are 1-dimensional soap-stars... sorry but they do appear to be just that...<br /><br />The surviving scenes in the end are a bit too much on the far-fetched side....<br /><br />In the end it is a OK remake, but no way if it surpasses "The Poseidon Adventure" in a long shot... Let the two films live together, side by side....</p></body></html>

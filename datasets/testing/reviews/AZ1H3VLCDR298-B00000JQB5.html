<meta name="summary" content="Very fun and enjoyable - Great FX and lots of humor!"></head><body><p>When this film was released in 1999, many critics bad-mouthed this movie, comparing it to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Fortunately, most of us didn't listen to them and the Mummy made almost as much as the Matrix. The comparisions are not fair, Raiders was more of an adventure movie with a serious tone, the Muumy is a homage to all the great monster flicks of the Silver Screen. <p>Incorporated in this film is plenty of humor, mostly one-liners by Brendan Frasier, who plays the swashbuckling hero out to stop the undead creature. Rachel Weisz plays the feisty heroine who is out to uncover the mythical lost city of Hamunaptra, which is said to contain the &quot;wealth of Egypt&quot;. Her brother is played by John Hannah, as her brother, who is out not for scientific gain, but for personal wealth. Frasier leads them because he was there at the city once, and is going back in search of treasure, with the funding of Weisz's character.<p>But treasure-hunting soon turns into mummy-hunting as they awaken the long-dead priest Imhotep, who is now out to restore his body and revive his deceased lover. What follows is a great mixture of horror and adventure, with some of the best special effects ever in a movie.<p>As for the DVD, the picture is excellent, even for a DVD, with terrific color representation and very good digital sound reproduction. There are a lot of extras here, too, and if you have a DVD-ROM in your computer you will be able to play a game that accompanies the disc. For DVD owners looking for a fun time with a loud movie, this is for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Role Will Ferrell was Born to Play..."></head><body><p>Anchorman is the funniest film that I've seen in the past ten years. I haven't laughed as consistently or harder than I did at some of the lines from this film:<br /><br />Champ: I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and then never call her back!<br /><br />Wes Mantooth: Dorothy Mantooth is a Saint!<br /><br />or<br /><br />Brick:"...Years later a doctor will tell me that I have an I.Q. of 48 and that I am what people would call mentally retarded."<br /><br />or<br /><br />Ron: "You have an incredible heine...I mean that things good...I wanna be friends with it...Do you know who I am? I'm kind of a big deal...I'm known...I have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mohogany."<br /><br />Seriously, do not hesitate to buy this film it is hysterical. Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy but his supporting cast is just as good. This will go down in the comedy annals as one of the greats. Highest Recommendation.</p></body></html>

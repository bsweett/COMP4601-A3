<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF TIM BURTON'S BEST MOVIES EVER!"></head><body><p>This is a classic movie that is now presented on a great D.V.D. Tim  Burton really outdid himself with this film. Get the movie on this edition. Also, do not forget the sequel BATMAN: RETURNS and stop there (sorry, I for got to mention you should get the classic BATMAN BEGINS). Batman 3 and 4 suck.</p></body></html>

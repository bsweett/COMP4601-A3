<meta name="summary" content="NEVER EXPECTED IT TO BE SO GOOD"></head><body><p>I heard and read some bad reviews besides I never liked Nicole Kidman so I thought it would be just another so-so thriller. And I was pleasantly surprised watching it as I wanted the film to last as long as possible - I was enjoying it that much. I liked every scene, every dialogue (they all were brilliant and very living), every line.<br />This is one of the best political thrillers I've ever seen but there were something more to the film so I can say it's not just a thriller. It's a very tender and sensitive story about two life-beaten persons who are trying to cope with life's difficulties and find love maybe. We can't speak definately about love here, because everything remained rather hazy in the picture, but I found a lot of love there - much more than in any regular love story. Kidman and Penn were so convincing in their roles, and Sydney Pollack executed such an elaborate and delicate directing, so that for me this is one of the most truthful movies about love between two people, although there are no love scenes and even no kisses. It's so rare these days we get a chance to see something really worthy like this. It's the exact case when we can say for sure that the film was done by real professionals. Don't miss this one of the best movies of the year. Bravo, Mr. Pollack!</p></body></html>

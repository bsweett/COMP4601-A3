<meta name="summary" content="The best old-time cliffhanger you never saw."></head><body><p>Writer-director Kerry Conran's debut feature "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is both an amazing-looking modern technological feat and a darn entertaining throwback to old Hollywood serials. It's got so much in it that's cool to look at, first of all. And the plot, story and characters have so much pluck that the film wins you over.<br /><br />Thank goodness someone had the sense to finally make a live-action movie about giant killer robots invading New York. I was afraid they wouldn't make one in my lifetime.<br /><br />The story is told in old Hollywood comic-book style, where the hero always cares about his wacky sidekick way more than his girlfriend. The heroine's hair and makeup is always flawless - even though she's escaped from the giant robots, traveled across the globe (and underwater!) in her ex-boyfriend's plane, gotten trapped in a radioactive mine filled with dynamite AND tried to get the biggest scoop in her career as a reporter.<br /><br />Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan, also known as Sky Captain, the flying ace who heads his own private air battalion intent on protecting the world. Law gives Joe enough attitude and goofy charm to come off as a clean-shaven Errol Flynn in this movie.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, in the funniest and perhaps trickiest role in the movie, plays Polly Perkins, a reporter for the New York Observer who's not above putting her own life (but never her camera) at risk while tracking down an evil madman's plot to destroy the world. Polly, who's either brilliant or dumb-as-a-post depending upon the situation she's in, is also completely self-serving and manipulative. She whines too much, bugs Sky Captain too much, flirts too obviously and doesn't listen to anything anyone has to say. Because of this - and because she's following in the footsteps of her female-heroine ancestors like Fay Wray, her character is HILARIOUS.<br /><br />Many people might have a problem with Polly for this same reason. But, as Paltrow plays her, she's more than just face-value irritating. Paltrow plays her intentionally without irony, short of winking at the camera much of the time, but the joke of Polly Perkins and the running gag of her camera comes through in spades in the film.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie shows up briefly, but her part in the film is key. And her biggest scene provides the film with a great moment that had me and others applauding in the theater.<br /><br />As for the computer effects, they're awesome - even if they're at times obviously fake. That's partly the point, for the effects in the movies "Sky Captain" is paying homage to did the same thing. Still, the sepia-toned look of the entire film is a marvel.<br /><br />The movie just sweeps you up in its glee, and there are cliffhangers every 10 minutes - the likes of which I haven't seen since "Raiders of the Lost Ark." "Sky Captain" has mild language, good laughs and would work for the whole family.<br /><br />It's a very fun trip. I loved this movie.</p></body></html>

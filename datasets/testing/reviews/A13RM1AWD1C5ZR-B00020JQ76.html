<meta name="summary" content="The Rundown-Cool, Funny and Entertaining"></head><body><p>The Rundown, directed by Peter Berg (Very Bad Things)and starring The Rock a.k.a Dwayne Douglas Johnson, Seann William Scott, Rosario Dawson and Chrisotper Walken is one cool, action flick.<br />  The Rock, who plays the natural action hero shows us he can act (much better than in the dreadful, "The Scorpion King") as well as his softer side.  Seann William Scott is funny and amusing as always, though he's best known for playing Stifler in the "American Pie" films.  Rosario Dawson, (looking better) pulls off her role too as a rebe leader of a village and who could forget Christopher Walken as our villan playing a typical role here, who is also reasonbly amusing.<br />  The storyline to this movie is nothing amazing, but it's a little different than the formulaic plots to a lot of action films coming out these days.  The Rock plays Beck, a bounty hunter who is collecting debt for his mob boss.  Though he wants out of the business and wants to retire to open up a restaurant his boss says that he has to do one more job for him, in which he'll gain 250 thousand dollars.  He of course agrees, this time to rescue his boss's estranged son in the Amazon.  The film takes on an interesting path from here with nice and new might I add action sequences.  With stylish stunts done by the big guy himself.  This film is pretty humorous too, mainly due to Scott and The Rock, the rapport between them is well portrayed.  Rosario Dawson plays the love interest of Scott as a  rebel leader who is more deceptive and dangerous than she seems.  And Walken plays a mine owner who is on their trail when he finds something of interest to him that Scott's character has.<br />  The Rundown is rated PG-13 for Adventure Violence and Some Crude Language.  There are mainly intense but bloodless gun, knife, and whip fights.  Also some nice fighting sequences, which are well choreograped and different.  There is also toilet humor, reasonably mild sexual innuendo and as stated earlier some crude dialogue & language.  Worth seeing in theatres as I have luckily and possibly owning on Video or DVD.</p></body></html>

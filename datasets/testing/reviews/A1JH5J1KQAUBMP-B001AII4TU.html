<meta name="summary" content="Still a lot of fun"></head><body><p>Unwilling to assume control of the land of Far Far Away in accordance with the wishes of the deceased Frog King (John Cleese), Shrek (Mike Myers) enlists the aid of Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to bring back the long lost Arthur (Justin Timberlake) to rule in his place.  However, even as he attempts to evade one type of responsibility, he learns that he is about to face another: becoming a father.  And then there is the threat of Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), who has assembled an army of storybook villains.<br /><br />There's plenty going on in this third installment of the popular series that is just as much fun for adults as it is for children.  The animation and voice talent are top notch, and the screenplay does a good job of keeping the large cast of supporting characters in play.</p></body></html>

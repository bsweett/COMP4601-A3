<meta name="summary" content="This movie rocks so much, it ranks right up there with the big cats! And I'm definitely a wolf!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's all about a cop named Jake who a renegade cop named Alonzo Harris is on the intent to teach about doing the "right thing in a dog eat dog world of crime." It is filled with blood and gore, funny jokes and scenes, lots of memorable quotes, intense shooting & fistfight scenes, and to top it all off packed to the brim with more cursing & obscenity than you can shake a middle finger at. The acting is wonderful, nearly all the characters look cool, & all in all I give this a 9.75 out of 10. If you like fighting movies or police dramas, this film is for you. Period. Given the fact I'm a wolf lover as well as a lion, tiger and jaguar lover, I loved that "You need to be da wolf in dis here city!" by Alfonzo or whatever similar thing he spoke.</p></body></html>

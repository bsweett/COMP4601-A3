<meta name="summary" content="Do zombies have children?"></head><body><p>Bill Murray stars as an aging Don Juan (yes, sure, I just got it - his character's name is Don Johnston ) who is so deadly bored with his life and his much younger beautiful girlfriend (I assume his girlfriends have been always much younger and beautiful, and a man may actually get tired and bored with it) that he does not seem alive at all. One day, his latest girlfriend leaves him and at the same day a mysterious pink letter informs him that he could have a 19 year old son. Reluctantly, literally pushed by his friend and neighbor, an amateur private detective Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Don visits his four formers lovers (Sharon Stone (she organizes people's closets and has a teenage daughter Lolita (and Lolita she is ), Frances Conroy (a realtor with a loving husband and a big and sadly quiet house), Jessica Lange (she does not drink, she does not eat, she does not walk - but she can read the animals' minds); and Tilda Swinton, in a surprising role of a white trash who has a lot to say to Don but...does not. Instead, two of her intimidating friends do). This movie has been praised as a humorous cross-country journey a-la Jim Jarmush - anti-Hollywood style but I think that it is one of the scariest horror movies I've seen - "from the lives of zombies" and Bill Murray is the best zombie I've seen. Will he find out if he actually has a son? Do zombies have children? Do I care?</p></body></html>

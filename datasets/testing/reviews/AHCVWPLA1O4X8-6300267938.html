<meta name="summary" content="The paternal side of the Duke"></head><body><p>I suppose you could call this a sort of 'cult-classic' among John Wayne films.  It is considered one of the Duke's best (maybe even THE best) by many people, yet many critics gave rather discouraging reviews of the film (see Amazon's Editorial review, for example).  <p>This is an entertaining story about an old man who cannot hire enough men for his cattle drive, and who is forced to take along a group of boys instead.  This film finds Wayne in a somewhat different role, for although he plays a cattleman (not unusual for the Duke), he also has a soft, paternal side not often seen in his films.  This movie also differs in that Wayne does not emerge triumphant at the end of the film.<p>This is a great Western for any die-hard Western fan.  Not only fans of Westerns will enjoy this movie, however.  A great many people who do not like either the Duke or the Western genre thoroughly enjoy this movie, and perhaps that is what gives it such a lasting appeal.</p></body></html>

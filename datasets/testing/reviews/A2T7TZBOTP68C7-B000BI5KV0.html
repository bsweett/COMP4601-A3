<meta name="summary" content="Profoundly Moving Experience"></head><body><p>March of the Penguins was originally a French documentary that was adapted for the American silver screen.  Morgan Freeman does a wonderful job narrating.  The film follows the Emperor penguins of Antarctica as they seek to find a mate and raise a family in one of the harshest regions of Earth.<br /><br />The trailers and ads made it seem like March of the Penguins was a cutesy nature film for the kiddies.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The struggles of these oddly human-like creatures is deeply profound.<br /><br />Bring some Kleenex and forget the popcorn; you will be too engrossed to eat.<br /><br />Extras include a making-of documentary, a National Geographic feature on Emperor penguins, and a 7-minute Bugs Bunny cartoon from 1950 where Bugs tries to help a lost penguin return home.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="In the beginning. . ."></head><body><p>Denzel Washington brings his A Game to every role, and THE BOOK OF ELI is no exception; in fact, this might be one of the actor's finest performances, as Washington plays Eli, a quiet, peace-loving man--yet peace rarely finds him--on a mission of destiny in a post-apocalyptic world.  By now everyone knows what The Book is, and that it is desperately coveted by those who would wield it to control the surviving population, including Carnegie (a brooding Gary Oldman), the kingpin of a town splashed in the midst of desolation.  Thus THE BOOK OF ELI becomes a story of pursuit, with Washington making his way west (followed by young Solara, played by Mila Kunis), with Carnegie's henchmen on his trail.<br /><br />The story is told simply, the settings are compelling and believable, and Washington performs with a grace and dignity that is stunning.  Interspersed throughout the film are several memorable roles, including Jennifer Beals (playing Solara's blind mother), Ray Stevenson (as Redridge, Carnegie's lieutenant), Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour (a cannibalistic couple armed to the max), and Malcolm McDowell (a scholar at the end of Eli's quest).  My only problem with THE BOOK OF ELI centers around the violent confrontations; suspension of disbelief becomes exceedingly difficult when Eli constantly battles hordes of thugs, mows them down like grass, and walks away unscathed.  Annoying to be sure, but not annoying enough to take enjoyment away from a commanding performance and a very moving film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

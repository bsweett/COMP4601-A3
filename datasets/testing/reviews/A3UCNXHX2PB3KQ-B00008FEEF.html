Meyers returns on the same night as the murders in Part 1, tracking Laurie down to the hospital where more murder ensues. There's a little more cheesy slasher gore here, but the music and the way this movie has been filmed make this one another classic. Not to mention a surprise twist ending and another showstopping performance from the great Donald Pleasance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great thriller in the inimitable Hitchcock style..."></head><body><p>Rear Window and North by Northwest are my favorite Alfred Hitchcok films and rank very highly on the list of my favorite films overall. Although they are very different films, they both share great suspense, creative plots, some humor, and wonderful stars - what more could you ask for in a movie? Additionally, Rear Window offers some interesting insights into human nature and shows that, like L.B. Jeffries, we (as movie watchers) are essentially voyeurs. <p>Basically, Rear Window is about photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) who, not being able to move due to a cast on his broken leg, starts to use his powerful camera lenses to observe people in the neighboring apartments. While watching, he notes the strange behavior of one man...and then begins to believe that the man murdered his wife. With a beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) at his side, Jeffries investigates the situation, creating a great deal of suspense. The movie has a wonderfully clever conclusion which I am NOT going to describe: watch it and find it out for yourself!  <p>Anyhow, this is a true thriller, Hitchcock style. It features classic actors (James Stewart, especially, is amazing in this film), a creative, original plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and interesting thoughts about voyeurism, etc. As a last point, Rear Window has a real sense of atmosphere - it really transports the viewer to the apartment building in the hot summer. All in all - this is a FANTASTIC film - I don't know how else to recommend it!</p></body></html>

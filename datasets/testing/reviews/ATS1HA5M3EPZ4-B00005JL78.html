This was what I got from this movie.  The idea of being able to identify people who will commit murders is an intriguing one.  What it would be like to live in a city where no murders take place?<br /><br />Minority report is based on another one of Phillip K Dick's novels, a writer who had no technical inclination but great skill for using science fiction to tell very imaginative and human stories.  In this one, the Washington DC police force has a `Pre-Crime' dept, led by John Anderton (Tom Cruise) who can see the most lethal of crimes long before they happen.  This, plus some obvious civil rights twisting, allows them to arrest the person they view performing the murder.  Things are not great as we are introduced to the characters.  Anderton is a good cop, a workaholic who is estranged from his wife because of the death of their son.  He is also a drug user, apparently it is some sort of drug that just makes him forget the world and leaves no trace affects.<br /><br />The big problem comes when John goes into work and sees himself as a murder suspect through the same system that he has used to arrest so many before him.  This creates an obvious dilemma and Anderton is soon on the run, knowing that if he is caught, he will be put in status like everyone else without any sort of trial.<br /><br />Minority report is filled with imagination and explores the deep recessed memories of the characters.  The futuristic world is unlike many others, washed out with bright lights and filled with possible exploits of technology that could very well become real in the future.  Imagine an advertisement board that scans your eye to ID you and then uses your name in the spoken ad.<br /><br />Spielberg makes a huge hit with this movie and makes up gracefully for the abomination that was AI.  This story moves at brisk pace and is chock full of his signature touches.  Cruise does a great job portraying the troubled cop who looses himself in work by day, and does the same with narcotics at night, making it painfully obvious that he is not dealing with his own issues.<br /><br />The movie covers a lot of ground has John discovers the truth as he tries to find out why he would be seen as a murderer to the `Pre-cogs'.  The movie is a thriller of the highest caliber and should not be compared with AI, even though it shares some of its look.</p></body></html>

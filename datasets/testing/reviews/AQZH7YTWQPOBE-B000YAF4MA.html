<meta name="summary" content="A fitting tour de force for Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson"></head><body><p>Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are two of the best actors out there. That alone makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAF4MA">The Bucket List</a> a treat. It features both men at the top of their game. Nicholson as the millionaire hospital magnate and Freeman as the lowly mechanic strike an unlikely friendship while commiserating over their cancer. It's easy for movies about the elderly and death to take on an almost didactic air. However, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAF4MA">The Bucket List</a> is a much more subtle about two imperfect men trying to find an appropriate way to spend their last few months on Earth. This is an emotionally powerful film, made more so because it mixes comedy and tragedy so poignantly. I felt like every laugh was so good-natured, while every tear was so meaningful. It's been far too long since I've felt like I'd want to buy a recent movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAF4MA">The Bucket List</a> is an exception - I'll want to keep this one just as a reminder that how we die is at least as important as how we live.</p></body></html>

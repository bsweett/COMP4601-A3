<meta name="summary" content="A gentle comedy that's not quite what you'd expect."></head><body><p>Paul Weitz's "In Good Company" gives us a classic farcical setup--a middle-aged executive suddenly finds himself saddled with a boss half his age--and adds the not unexpected complication of the young boss falling in love with his older subordinate's daugther. That this story doesn't end up quite where you think it will, without sacrificing any of the pleasures of a well-wrought movie comedy, is a real tribute to writer-director Weitz, whose last film, "About a Boy," was similarly likable and unpredictable. Those who are looking for the broad ribaldry of Weitz's first major hit, "American Pie," will be largely disappointed by the gentle yet sharply observant humor of "In Good Company." Much of the film's appeal is centered in the appeal of the two leads. Dennis Quaid exudes gruff charm as the displaced middle-aged executive, and he's as sexy now as he's ever been. As the young boss, Topher Grace--as hesitant and bumbling in his new position as a newly hatched chick--has much the same appealing, Everyman quality as the young Tom Hanks. The story is essentially that of two good, likable men forced by circumstance into an adversarial relationship, and Quaid and Grace are extremely adept at keeping the laughs coming even as your hearts are breaking for them. As Quaid's daughter and Grace's love interest, Scarlett Johansson isn't called on to do much except be charming, but she's very good at that, as is Marg Helgenberger as her mom. There also are plenty of sharp supporting performances, particularly David Paymer (who looks more like Larry of The Three Stooges with each new role) as a downtrodden corporate cog; Clark Gregg as a loathsomely smug corporate hatchetman; and Malcolm McDowell in an unbilled cameo as the Bransonesque tycoon who serves as the plot's major catalyst.</p></body></html>

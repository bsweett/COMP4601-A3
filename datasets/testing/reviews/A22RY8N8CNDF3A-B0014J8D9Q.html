The 1992 movie is complex, it examines what is good and evil, the viewpoints of age and youth, finding courage, doing what is important while feeling guilt and yet finding redemption through change.<br /><br />This is a Western set in Kansas and Big Whisky, Wyoming.  The opening scene is in Kansas and shows William Munny, a retired gunslinger, chasing pigs with his two young children, a girl and a boy.  Munny is also a widower and has to make do on his small farm.  He has sworn off gun-slinging and wild women to honor the love of his life, his wife who  died at age 29.  She turned his life around and though poor, he felt good about making up for his past life of violence, drinking and wild women.<br /><br />A young man on a horse comes up to Munny.  He is the Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett).  He has a proposal to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute in Wyoming.  There is reward money of $1,000 and they can split two ways.  Munny initially refuses to help with the assassination, but realizes that it would help his children have a better future if he could afford to do something else.<br /><br />After a few days he sets off with his best friend, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) also a retired gunfighter.  Ned reluctantly leaves his Native American Wife, "Two Feathers" to go along on the hit.  Two Feathers is near Munny's farm and agrees to check in on his children and help when they need her.<br /><br />The trio get to the town of Big Whisky and find the Sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), enforcing gun control and using his power as he sees fit.  He had denied justice to the prostitutes who now want revenge and have secretly gathered the $1,000 reward money.<br /><br />Thereafter the story keeps developing with twists and turns.  The mighty win over the weak.  It is a haunting story of life's and moralities ambiguity.</p></body></html>

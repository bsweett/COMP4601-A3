<meta name="summary" content="I Loved This Movie!"></head><body><p>I had just read and reviewed a book on Madagascar so I was really interested when my granddaughter and I watched this movie. I'm telling you it was great. I won't go into the story as you can read about it yourself in these reviews, but I will tell you there were so many fun things about watching it that I'm still smiling.<br /><br />The storyline is great, the soundtract oustanding, visuals bring every activity to life, animation supurb and the characters are a chuckle a minute.  My top favorite, "GLORIA, the hippo." Why is it that I believe I know some humans that remind me of Gloria.<br /><br />You have to see this one, with or without a child. It truly is entertainment at its best.  Sit back, relax, giggle and enjoy. Recommended.</p></body></html>

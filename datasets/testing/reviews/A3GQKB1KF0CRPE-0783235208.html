<meta name="summary" content="WOW!!! Universal and Hammer was never like this!!"></head><body><p>Brandan Fraser delivers a super performance a la Indiana Jones, in this remake of the Mummy.  Instead of the lumbering mummy of the old Universal films and, later in the remakes with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee for Hammer, this mummy is really something to fear.  I always thought why would anyone fear the mummy in the old films, he plods along so even a granny with a walker could outrun him!!!  As the mummy gains power, it is a very vital being with amazing powers.  The pace starts out fast, and keeps up the roller coaster ride, with AMAZING special effects.  Brilliant comedic support from John Hallam, ads to the mix of adventure, romance and mild-blowing effects.  An Absolute must!!!</p></body></html>

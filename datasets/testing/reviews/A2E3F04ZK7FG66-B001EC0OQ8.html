<meta name="summary" content="One of the great detective films of all time"></head><body><p>Humphrey Bogart had been in many films in the 1930's, but this is the one that made him a star and gave him mystique and, along with "Casabanca", is probably the film role for which he is most remembered. There is really no extraordinary action going on in this film and no grand finish. It is basically a character study of Sam Spade, the definitive hard-boiled private detective and to a lesser degree of Gutman, one of the villains - and there are several - played by Sidney Greenstreet in his first film appearance. Why is Sam Spade so fascinating when he has so many bad personality traits and character flaws? Because nobody is this tough! Not until Dirty Harry came along 30 years later did the silver screen exhibit someone with such a knack for laughing in the face of danger. Gutman's cartoonish armed front men are just a joke to Sam Spade, who easily disarms them, often makes them look ridiculous, and then just hands the loaded weapons right back over to them without a second thought. In fact, at no time during this film is there a predicament for which Spade doesn't have a quick and cool response. Mary Astor is also great as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the femme fatale who comes to Spade's office at the beginning of the film and sets all of the action in motion. Even though Spade can see that she has been piling one lie on top of another throughout the film, for some reason he falls for her, the one act in this whole film that seems somewhat inconsistent with Spade's self-interested personna until the final scene when he does reveal that he has a "code" of sorts. This is truly one of the most interesting films of all time and a great vehicle for Bogart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent camera work, colours, great print ... ends there"></head><body><p>Let's give credit where credit is due.  Suspiria has beautiful colours, fantastic camera work, and a nice transfer. It ends there.  The basic plot and appalling acting let the film down.  As for the horror scenes - well, let's remember that it was made in 1977 and the horror scenes would have frightened audiences then - the R rating was fitting for the time.  Times have changed, and audiences expect more of horror films.<p>DVD SUMMARY:<br />If you are like me, and heard so much about Suspiria, you will want to see it to satisfy your own curiosity.  Aside from the bad points regarding the acting and plot, I am pleased to tell you that Anchor Bay have delivered a STUNNING print of this movie on DVD.  It's so pristine that it's hard to believe it was filmed in 1977.  Everything about the print deserves 10 out of 10.  It should be reference for how to restore an old film.  I have the Single Disc edition DVD, which is probably the best version to buy if you haven't seen the film.  You still get the same version shown on the 3-disc, and some extras (but not the documentary), and also the DTS soundtrack.  <p>Suspiria is a difficult DVD movie to find to rent, so if you are interested in seeing it, just buy the single edition DVD (it's cheaper).  Despite the fact that I don't really love the movie, I am still glad to own it because of the camera work and colours - as well as the excellent DVD transfer.  Nothing can quite prepare you for the incredible restoration work that Anchor Bay have done.  Bravo Anchor Bay.</p></body></html>

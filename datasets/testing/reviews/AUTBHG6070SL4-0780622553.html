<meta name="summary" content="Great visuals"></head><body><p>This movie leads the viewer through a maze of incredible imagery. The city above is neo-grunge, but the Strangers' city below is a bizarre Art Deco noir. The Strangers redesign that city above, every day, in amazing scenes of rubbery, expanding skyscrapers. The city below is filled with dark, cavernous spaces and monumental icons of unknown meaning. (The Strangers also defined the trenchcoat look later popularized by The Matrix.)<p>The story has that Kafka feeling about it that is blatantly fictional, but still sounds true to that frightened little voice in the back of the mind. The city and everyone in it are manipulated every night at midnight by dark forces for dark purposes. Each morning, that facts of history have been altered. The population's memory has also been altered to match. All of the past has been changed, switched onto a new track -- except for one man.<p>It's quite amazing how, with such a strong start, the movie falters so badly. There was much more to be made of this plot, and much better use to be made of Jennifer Connelly. The Strangers never managed to make much sense - despite the nominal purpose for their experiment, they show little interest in its outcome. In the end, the incredible visuals carry the movie.<p>I like this one for its imagery and for the Twilight Zone sense of its beginning. It could have been more, but that's enough.</p></body></html>

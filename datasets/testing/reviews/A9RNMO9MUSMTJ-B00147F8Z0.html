I taught this would be a one on one<br />creature movie...but now...there are several aliens...and alien babies and<br />its not all dark...there is a small city...with regular people and no,we<br />are not stuck in a wharehouse for the full movie...the movie moves ..the<br />blood gushes and ..................<br />A good rental....but also good for a keeper.</p></body></html>

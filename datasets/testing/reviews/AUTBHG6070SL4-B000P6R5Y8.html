<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable story with a touch of magic"></head><body><p>The story starts in a dismally familiar way - a family with not enough to go around, a school full of bullies, and unique interests that set Jess apart from all the other kids. Then Leslie arrives. The new kid is an outcast too, so Jess and Leslie end up being outcasts together. Leslie has many skills, but one that seems truly magical. She has an overflowing imagination, the kind that envelops everyone around her if they let it. Jess lets himself become part of it, and is suddenly king of a realm filled with giants, winged warriors, and other impossible beings.<br /><br />It's a Disney movie, so it's put together well and it's filled with cute kids and identifiable stereotypes. Special effects are just that - special, used with a light hand until the final scene. The story is easy for kids to understand, but the plot includes a troubling major event from which it never quite seemed to recover. If your little one is at all skittish, you might want to read the book so she's properly prepared for that part of the movie.<br /><br />Only one element of the story looked out of place, where a teacher takes Jess on a Saturday "field trip" alone, and with sketchy parental knowledge. The book is over twenty years old now. Maybe, back then, that could seem as safe and encouraging as it was meant to look. We no longer live in that naive world. Although it was in fact quite innocent, it has a dark, creepy appearance to modern eyes. Any parent of young kids will want to have a long talk about that after the movie, or maybe before, or maybe both.<br /><br />Still, it's an enjoyable flick. The child actors are engaging, and the balance of fantasy with gritty reality comes off well. And, whatever you may think of that tragic defining moment, such things really do happen, and kids have to deal with them. If a kid in your life faces a shock of that kind, there might be value in knowing that other kids faces shocks too, and make it through them.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

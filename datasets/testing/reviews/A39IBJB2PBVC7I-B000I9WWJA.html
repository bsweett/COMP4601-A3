<meta name="summary" content="Spike Lee Attempts Entertainment"></head><body><p>Spike Lee was once "the Great White Hope."  American liberal intellectuals were ready to lionize a young black filmmaker qualified to "speak" for black America.  And he tried.  Regrettably, movies like She's Gotta Have It, Do The Right Thing, School Daze, and Jungle Fever - though interesting as only worthy failures can be, were so self-congratulatory and preachy that they resembled A/V Op-Ed pieces more than movies.<br /><br />Powered by a great true story and towering performance by Denzel Washington, Spike Lee did hit it out of the park once, with Malcolm X, since then it's been a pretty bleak season for the alleged vunderkind.<br /><br />With the Inside Man, Lee ventures into uncharted territory - an exciting, action picture with an interesting psychological twist.  To say he fails is to say the Germans lost WWII.  This failure is made even more remarkable considering how much help he has.  As with Malcolm X, the budget is lavish - this is a dressy film to watch.  Marquee talent is everywhere, Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, even Jodie Foster.  With talent like this, only an idiot could go wrong, right?  But Lee is a very special idiot, and he manages.<br /><br />Despite all the hoopla, this is a one-gadget movie, and by the time it arrives you'll be wondering if Reno 911 is on.  Not since the days of Marcel Marceau has anyone does less with less.  Christopher Plummer looks great and gives a splendid performance, but unless his character became a bank president at 12, the entire premise of the movie is blown.  Without that, the logic, motivation, and righteous indignation required to give this film any credibility at all are gone.<br /><br />The turgid pace of this anti-thriller gives Lee plenty of time to indulge in the sort of simplistic, heavy-handed lecturing for which he is known ad nauseum.  A little boy and his video game, "never forget" wall posters, a man and his turban, even breast size, all provide opportunities for Lee to beat his audience in the face.<br /><br />Of all this film's shortcomings, the complete squandering of Jodie Foster is most puzzling.  One imagines she doesn't work for free, and yet her character floats in and out of the action completely unexplained.  Washington makes the most of a bad situation, and Clive Owen, an exceptional actor, tries hard to carry the freight.  Unfortunately, there is no freight.</p></body></html>

Two of the thieves return to the rendezvous, one of them dying from a gunshot to the gut.  Another thief shows up, but nobody knows the whereabouts of the other three criminals, what their boss is doing or why the cops seemed to know all about their plan.  Did someone set them up?  Where are the jewels?  And why is everyone named after colors (Mr. Blond, Mr. Pink, Mr. White) and dressed in the exact same cheap car salesman suits?<br /><br />That's the set-up for the 1992 Quentin Tarantino film that changed filmmaking forever.  The genesis of QT's introduction to Hollywood is now the stuff of legend, as the one-time video store clerk spent his spare time watching movies and trying to break into the business.  His directorial debut features a small group of criminals, thrown together by a grizzled old hood who insures each man knows everything about the job but nothing about each other.  Once the heist blows up, the thieves don't know who to trust or what to do.<br /><br />Mr. White (Keitel) works as the film's principal character (although fans of Pink, Blond and Orange may disagree).  Keitel occupies the essential role of having to develop a working relationship with the actors playing the three surviving criminals.  He must be father figure to the dying Orange, debate opponent to the philosophical Pink and Alpha-Male rival to the maniac Blond.<br /><br />The film's cleverest and most engaging scenes deal with the married-couple-like bickering of White and Pink (Buscemi).  They spar in a never-ending debate of rational thought versus emotional thought, as the cool and professional Mr. Pink knows to examine all angles and aspects, not trusting anyone, while Mr. White has faith in his gut, believing more of what he wants to be true.  They argue over the potential identities of undercover cops; they argue over their names (Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?); and they even argue over whether to leave a tip at a greasy diner similar to one found in all Tarantino movies.<br /><br />The White/Pink debates feature the fresh, pop-culture injected dialogue that defines Tarantino's filmmaking aesthetic.  Characters also discuss Pam Grier films, the true meaning of Madonna songs and their new favorite radio program, K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies (which provides great buffer music for the film's chapters).<br /><br />With cool bad-guys, irresistible dialogue and a storyteller skilled in bringing his audience along with just enough information to keep them guessing, Reservoir Dogs deserves as much attention and admiration as Tarantino's more famous creation, Pulp Fiction.  And with an entire generation of filmmakers wanting to make the next Reservoir Dogs (the opening credit sequence that has been parodied in everything from Swingers to The Simpsons), its cult status will eventually grow into mainstream acclaim.</p></body></html>

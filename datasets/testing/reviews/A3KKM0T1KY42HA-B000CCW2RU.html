<meta name="summary" content="Exile Island"></head><body><p>Michael Bay has a lot of good movies under his umbrella. However, whether producing or directing, greatness has eluded him. The aversion to greatness held true under his direction of The Island.<br /><br />The Island is a good movie. Tons of action. Funny moments. Good suspense. And good acting by A-list actors. It's has a very cool story concept....<br /><br />It's too bad that cool story concepts with clever twists are often ruined for viewers that have not yet seen a film by reviewers that think it's a good idea to tell the story of what happened in a movie instead of giving thoughts on whether it is worthy of viewing. The neat little plot twist in The Island is so "out" that most viewing this movie already know the strange intricacies of the world that the two stars live in.<br /><br />Kudos to Michael Bay for not divulging the twist in the trailers to the movie.<br /><br />Hopefully you're reading this, and only this, as your basis to view, because I won't spoil it for you. I will say that Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor are excellent in their rolls as two escapees from an isolated colony designed to keep out the contaminations of a world gone bad.<br /><br />McGregor and Johansson flee through a futuristic city into extremely over the top situations where they survive what no else could possibly survive through. And this sensational, death defying ability of the two to stay alive really takes away from what could have been a much more realistic look at a possibility of something that could happen in the not too distant future.<br /><br />At least if the plot has already been ruined for you, the movie's entertainment value is not completely lost. It's a fun movie to watch that you can catch on cable as of this writing; no need to buy or rent unless you don't get any of the pay channels.<br /><br />So if you've got no new movies to look at in your queue and you see that there's a showing of The Island in your On Demand service...go for it. It's time well spent watching some Survivors getting cast off to Exile Island.</p></body></html>

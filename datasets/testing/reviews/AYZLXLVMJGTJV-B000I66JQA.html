It has a poetic resonance as it unfolds, sort of like how American Beauty portrayed. The film is stark in its ability to illustrate the truth and some people may react to the film in negativity. It is about pain, grief, choices on how to live your life or end it if you must. I think the overall emotion the film can reflect is compassion. Compassion for people who are living The Hours as they chose, not judging them, realizing they are we all struggle with pain, that life is not all pain and can be joyful. I was floored at how much this movie tugged at me. I am still reverbrating from it. Kidman, Streep and Moore were all outstanding! They made this movie an inspiration to watch. Notice how well Kidman achieves her accent and voice change. Her mannerisms are impeccable, they are not overdone, she channels her creativity it is so wonderful to watch. Streep is so honest in her acting, she becomes an emotion. Moore is subtle, very subtle and yet so effective! I was amazed at how much Ed Harris does for his roles. He is amazing! This movie is very emotional and can trigger depression. I felt a heaviness after watching it but there was also so much beauty layered within. So keep this in your mind if you chose to watch this film.<p>Lisa Nary</p></body></html>

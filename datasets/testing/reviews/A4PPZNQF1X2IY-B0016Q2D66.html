<meta name="summary" content="Drama without vision, but some impactful scenes"></head><body><p>Looks like the opinions are all over the map.  Definitely better than the dreadfully pedestrian "The Reader".  That withstanding, the script, although impactful, leaves the audience confused over the message/purpose of the movie.<br />The reason I give it four stars is for the overall authenticity of the tragic romance between the protagonists.  Several fight scenes pulled out the guts of the infamous and disturbing fights between young lovers when the relation sours, and dramatically depicts the unseemly and needless pain two nominally decent people can inflict on each other.  50s plastic commercialism is not a new subject,<br />yet the movie did have a new take on the matter as the couple dared to defy convention, but ultimately the movie was about how they ended up conspiring against each other and the simple beauties of a normal life.  DiCaprio's character especially was unveiled to be ultimately cowardly, hypocritical, and fawning to the luxuries and vacuous comforts he purportedly despised.  The movie is unable to end on a conclusive note however, and ultimately indicts both human desire but also convention.  A bit of a debbie downer i'd say.  About 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

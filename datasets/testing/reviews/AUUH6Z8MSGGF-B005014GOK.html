If only more movies could be like this: cut into a trailer and the people either demand it or don't. Then stuff like the upcoming Vince Vaughn and Kevin James movie, "The Dilemma" wouldn't get made. I remember cheering for this trailer in the theater and the movie was pretty much what I expected it to be. The premise is that an ex-Federale is hired for an assassination, but is then betrayed by the people who hired him who are trying to get a Senator re-elected by getting sympathy from the voters. Machete goes on a rampage of revenge with the help of the network.<br /><br />"Machete" is best when it embraces its genre. The campiness, the ridiculous amount of violence, gunfire, explosions, and gratuitous hot babes are all elements of what makes this movie work. The only parts that take away from the movie are the moments of seriousness where actors try to do something deeper with their performances. For example, Lindsay Lohan plays a slutty daughter of the man who hired and wronged Machete. Her back story is pretty bad, basically she enjoys putting nude photos of herself online to get attention for modeling and later takes a turn that gets her in a nun's uniform with a gun. The journey from point A to point B is a little painful, but if she could have just let herself go a little and rattle off one-liner's without being self conscious about it, she could have done better.<br /><br />Danny Trejo as Machete has a face we all remember, though before now may not have remembered his name so vividly. He carries this movie with awesome action sequences and deeply buried emotions. He's a man's man getting it done and then randomly hitting it with hot babes who get naked for him. Does that part make sense? Heck no. Does it feel like a reward for years of supporting hitman roles? Hells to the yeah.<br /><br />Jessica Alba plays Sartana Rivera, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent trying to track down the network that helps immigrants led by "She" played by Michelle Rodriguez. Once Machete is framed for a crime he didn't commit and is able to gather evidence against his foes, Sartana switches gears to help him and get the real criminals who set this up behind bars. Both women walk the line of the tone of this movie very well. They hop between earnestly fighting for their goals, oozing sex appeal, and participating in crazy action scenes. Cheech Marin has a great short stint as the ass-kicking Padre.<br /><br />The baddies are former "Lost" cast member, Jeff Fahey who is the man behind the curtain of the hire-up and main betrayer of Machete. His steel blue eyes and deep voiced resolve are perfect for setting up the movie. Robert De Niro is a little silly as a cowboy Anti-Immigration Texas Senator McLaughlin, but that fits this movie too.<br /><br />What this movie did amazingly well as make sure to incorporate every scene shown in the original fake trailer! It would have been a little better at "Grindhouse" length, say 75 minutes or so and trimming down some of the fat (scenes getting too serious, slowing the story down). Definitely worth checking out for some crazy violence and action! For example, I looked away from the TV for a second and missed FIVE people getting decapitated at once. Whoa.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is an audience track so you can listen to other people laughing and reacting to Machete decapitating people. There are five deleted scenes, some of which are a big surprise! Turns out Jessica Alba's character had a slutty twin whom she walks in on in bed with some guy often enough to be in two cut scenes. There are more scenes with our DeNiro politician where elements of the plot are explained to him (when they don't need to be).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>Hubby ordered this box set from ebay. He was very happy with the perches. We watched Scareface (1983) a lot. But we never bothered to watch Scareface (1932). I just finished watching Scareface (1932) and I'm not into it.<br /><br />I thought it was going to be just like Scareface from (1983). Because so many times they get old movies like Scareface (1932) and up date them. But it wasn't. There were some scenes that were the same as the newer Scareface. But it started out different and played out different.<br /><br />One scene that bothered me in Scareface (1932) is when the cops were shooting at his house. His sister was just shot and instead of trying to save his self or fight back he just lays by his sisters side telling her not to die. I can understand him laying next to her for a few minutes. But he lay's next to her telling her not to die and getting mad at her for dying for a long time. What does he want her to do? Get up and say ok Tony because you told me not to.... lol. Even after he got up to save his self he keeps calling out to her. I think that part was dumb.</p></body></html>

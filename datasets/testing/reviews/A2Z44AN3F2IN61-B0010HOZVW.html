<meta name="summary" content="better than I expected"></head><body><p>I was initially a little dubious about watching this movie, worried that it would be a tear-jerker. It wasn't.<br /><br />It also wasn't a revenge/action movie, though that's definitely part of it.<br /><br />Erica Bain's (Jodie Foster) fiance David (Naveen Andrews) is killed in front of her, and The Brave One is the story of how she deals with that. She buys herself a gun to feel safer, and then finds herself courting danger with the gun for protection, and finally becoming a vigilante.<br /><br />But it's not something she sets out to do--she's not trying to be a superhero, and she's not reveling in the violence or even remotely feeling good about it--she's just trying to feel safe.<br /><br />Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is the detective on her fiance's case, and ultimately on her own, and he plays a sounding board, conscience, and catalyst.<br /><br />Gah. I'm having a terrible time describing this movie. It's always so much easier to say what I don't like than what I do.<br /><br />One scene that sticks in my mind is when Erica is in the emergency room, the action is interposed with a love scene between her and David. It's visually poignant and powerful. And there are a lot of similarly powerful scenes.<br /><br />Okay, I give up. Bottom line: I loved the movie.</p></body></html>

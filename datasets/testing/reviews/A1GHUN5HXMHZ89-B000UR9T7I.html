I not only liked the fact they showed that everyone can have a dark side, but Parker didn't seem as kiddish as in the previous movies. I enjoyed the new bad guys Venom (Spiderman copy with nasty big teeth), Sandman (a muscular thief that gets rematerialized with sand), and a new Goblin (Son of Goblin), and the turn around of two of them. Spidey uses the force to turn them, well something like that. Nicely done effects added to the good story and acting. Overall plenty of action, and a more in depth look at Parker and those around him. I bought this on DVD since I had the other two already. I'm glad to have this one in the set. Excellent quality DVD with several extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This movie will steal your breath."></head><body><p>This movie got a lot of flack for being too depressing but I think The Hours starring Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf is a fascinating, intimate look at the stigma and isolation that comes from being clinically depressed. Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep also star. Moore has never been better! She nails every scene she is in, although I was very disappointed with Streep's performance, very over the top and wooden. Kidman earned an Oscar for her fragile performance of the suicidal writer. I love the scene when she tells her husband she feels suffocated and wants to go back home so she can write. Toni Collette has a small part as the neighbor of Moore, too bad her scene was so brief 'cause her scene made the biggest impact.  I highly recommend this sensitive and gorgeous film, deals with heavy issues but it is a film you'll remember. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

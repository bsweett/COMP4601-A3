I just saw the DVD last night, expecting the worst (big-time, long-time comic book fan here...) and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Not that some of the vitriol directed toward this film has no basis. It does. As much as I love "Nip/Tuck", Julian McMahon has nothing good to do here. I don't like the way they re-imagined Doctor Doom. Actually, I think he would have been great as some regal, European monarch with issues, but all we got was some cliched corporate baddie.<br /><br />Jessica Alba isn't as bad here as say, Sofia Coppola in "Godfather III", and she's sure nice to look at...but in terms of character development, she's given the short end of the stick. Yes she looks hot, but she doesn't "look" like a Sue Storm...<br /><br />Speaking of, Mr. Fantastic is also malformed, pun intended. His character is also not as interesting as it could have been. He needed more chances to be intelligently heroic...to show off the "brain" that Ben Grimm keeps harping about...<br /><br />Enough of the bad mouthing for now...the rest of the film was a blast!<br /><br />Michael Chilis is sublime as The Thing. He's a wonder in that Thing suit. He manages to convey pathos, rage, humor...he's perfect.<br /><br />Chris Evans as the Torch simply rocks. His over-the-top performance served as a nice contrast to the others, and the shenanigans between he and The Thing were right out of the comics. I can understand how he might be irrititating to some viewers, but I kinda think that's the point.<br /><br />Most of the special effects were great as well! I don't know why there's so much venom directed towards the effects. Only the stretching business looks dopey, but the whole Brooklyn Bridge scene is spectacular, the Torch flying is breath-taking and the finale is terrific!<br /><br />The dealing with the public, the coping with the new powers...it was all handled well, with great visuals. Yes, the script isn't as polished or cynical/witty as some may like, but in some cases, simpler is better, and maybe this movie isn't only for us comic geeks...<br /><br />Take a chance on this movie, and I think you're gonna be pleasantly surprised...and if you already think this is going to be a piece of trash, you'll probably be blown away!</p></body></html>

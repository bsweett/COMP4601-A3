Of all the outrageous, silly fanboy concepts that have been thrown around over the years, the Freddy-Jason crossover is one of the wackiest.  Furthermore, even if it were to get made, odds are that the studios wouldn't put any effort or money into it, and just cheaply slap it together, knowing that people will see it anyway.  Certainly, 'Freddy vs. Jason' is not a great piece of art, nor a great film, but it's a load of fun, and manages to find the right tone:  It's got humor without being a smug campfest, and has a script that was written seriously enough that the whole film doesn't seem as ridiculous as it probably ought to.  It's also got a sharp, surprisingly classy visual style, care of director Ronny Yu, and a lot a cool gore, at least by mainstream film standards.  That's about all I'd want from this film.<br /><br />The basic premise is this: The adults of Springwood have thoroughly erased the memory of Freddy Krueger, which has made him lose his power, and his ability to kill.  In order to get back, Freddy invades Jason's death-dreams, posing as his mother, saying 1- Stop being dead, stupid, you're immortal 2- Go to Springwood, start killing.  Naturally, once Jason's rampage begins, the adults begin to suspect that it's Freddy's doing, and he starts to regain his power.  Freddy soon returns to full power, but Jason won't stop killing, which naturally aggravates Freddy, so he decides to take care of Jason.  Throughout all this, there are a number of teens who must find out what's going own, and fight for their lives etc. but the specifics regarding them don't really matter.<br /><br />Of course, the new world and mythology is not 100% consistent with what came before, but, it's pretty good, and it's not as if the original films were remotely consistent anyway, so this one couldn't possibly make it all add up.  Certainly, the plot is nothing to write home about, but the film actually has one, and it is a  whole lot less idiotic than I'd anticipated.  The characterization doesn't fare as well, as they tend not to be particularly interesting, and are often cliched (the sassy black chick, the stoner, young cop who trusts the teens, Nerdlinger etc.) but, eh, who cares?  The only characters who matter are Freddy and Jason, here played by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger.  Englund does a good job with Freddy, naturally, making him a bit more menacing and less humorous than he tended to be in the latter films.  I, like many others, was a bit upset when I heard that Hodder wouldn't be playing Jason, but Kirzinger does a great job. (not that there's all that much to the role)  He plays it in about the same way that Hodder did in Jason X, as the huge, lumbering yet somewhat contemplative killing machine, but w/o much of the sardonic detachment that Hodder through into the role in X.  (Which is appropriate, as although 'Freddy vs. Jason' is hardly completely serious, it isn't as jokey and campy as that film)  Although I still think it's pretty damn lame that Hodder got booted from the job, I think the practical effect on the film is pretty much nil.<br /><br />Though the film certainly isn't scary, it's occasionally a bit eerie, and the dream sequences are generally very nicely done.  (The first dream the Monica Keena character has is particularly good)  Of course, I've always been a Jason man, and the scenes of him hacking up innumerable teens are always a delight.  Notions of suspense are almost completely lacking, but it's got a high body count and plenty of great kills.  (Jason's first real kill is one of the most brutal, yet funny he's ever had, and there's an excellent, uhh, cut-in-half, death, too)  Also, there's an utterly priceless scene where he storms a rave, after being dosed in everclear and lit aflame, cutting swath throught the teens like a flaming angel of death.<br /><br />The funny thing is, although the notion of Freddy and Jason being in a film together is pretty amusing, the idea of them fighting isn't all that exciting to me.  These scenes actually turned out very well, though I think the scenes of them dealing with the kids are generally better.  Freddy uses lots of Freddy-fu on Jason, which is pretty damn funny, and their final confrontation earns lots of points for sheer gruesomeness. (I seriously doubt the MPAA would allow this level of violence to be wrought on truly human characters w/o earning the film an NC-17 rating)<br /><br />Yeah, I guess I'm done.  Reviews are pointless, as anyone interested in this film already saw it, but, whatever.  Also, the DVD looks very, very nice.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

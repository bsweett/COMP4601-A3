His radio addresses seemed overly repetitive and empty.  I also thought it was odd how much fully functioning base infrastructure and military hardware still existed after J-Day.  I can suspend disbelief surrounding Connor having to rise up through the ranks to some degree.  And I thought the production values and action were excellent.  The opening sequence is breathtaking.  CGI Arnold worked.<br /><br />I still think the Sarah Connor Chronicles was vastly deeper and more thoughtful.  Fans who'd like to see more of TSCCs should know there's an effort underway to get direct-to-bluray or feature films done, possibly even the series brought back after Dollhouse and several other shows have been canceled and Glee is waning into cameo ridiculousness, but you will have to be vocal about it.  So post on the net.  Send letters.  Spread the word.  Don't just rely on a few of the actors and production people to push it through, as it's likely to never happen otherwise.</p></body></html>

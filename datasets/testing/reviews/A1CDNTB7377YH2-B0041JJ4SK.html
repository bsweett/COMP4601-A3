<meta name="summary" content="Stupid but funny"></head><body><p>If you liked the humor in the Revenge of the Nerds movies you should definately like this one.  This movie is so stupid but has some gut-wrenchingly funny parts nonetheless.<br /><br />There are a lot of stereotypes (racial profilers, Indian convenience store guys, etc.) thar are played out well in a humorous way.<br /><br />No matter how far the pair travel, they seem to run into the same people are end up back at some of the same places.  And yes, the movie did make me make a trip to White Castle, where I hadn't been there in a few years.</p></body></html>

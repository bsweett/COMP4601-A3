<meta name="summary" content="good acting, mediocre film"></head><body><p>Be sure you're wide awake when you go to see this film, because you'll need to stay alert and attentive to get your money's worth.<br /><br />Much of that worth comes not in the form of a compelling script or memorable cinematrography, but in the amusing and endearing performance turned in by Giamatti and several members of the supporting cast.<br /><br />If you really like film, you'll want to see Lady in the Water for the corners of the envelope that it pushes with its fantasy motif embedded in that icon of American banality, the apartment block and its ubiquitous swimming pool.<br /><br />If you like to see the occasional movie but are not into the film tradition, you'll do best to look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

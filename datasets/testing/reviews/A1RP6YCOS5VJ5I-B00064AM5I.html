I like films like this, but it really had a slow beginning. But after the first fifteen minutes, it really picks up and is very entertaining. The jokes are funny and what I like most about the film is all the people in it and who make the cameos. William Shatner, Chuck Norris, and even Alan Tudyk who played Wash on Firefly, one of my favorite TV series, is in this film. Overall, I ended up liking this better than I thought I would have judging from the beginning of the film.</p></body></html>

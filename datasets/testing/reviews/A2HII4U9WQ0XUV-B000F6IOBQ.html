Or right.<br /><br />Or out of control---I mean, really, who's to judge, when you're a bloodthirsty immortal critter, way long in the tooth, with big old fleshy batwings who's been consigned to the vamp-version of Solitaire for 600 years or so?<br /><br />Whatever. At the very least, "Underworld 2" manages to answer the question: "where does a Thousand-pound p*ssed-off Werewolf sit?"<br /><br />Answer: any-damned-where he wants.<br /><br />I was a big fan of the first installment, which was all somber-gothic moonscapes and undead power politics and some gory bloodshed and high style and---umm, did I mention Kate Beckinsdale in a leather catsuit yet? No?<br /><br />Anyhoo, I wish I could say nicer things about director Len Wiseman's latest paean to things that flap, howl, and bump in the night, but what it boils down to is really three things:<br /><br />1)Len Wiseman doesn't really *like* vampires. Or werewolves (cough, cough, *Lycans*). Or more to the point, monsters.Why? Because he really takes great pains---in the last flick, and finally, totally, in this one---to burn both classic monsters out of the running.<br /><br />Forever: hence "Evolution". In other words, he wants to make his movie monsters normal, full-blooded, all-American, apple-pie eating, suburb-living, SUV-driving ordinary gals and dolls.<br /><br />So: death-dealer Selene gets a little hybrid-juice in her veins, hangs around in broad daylight, and gets some missionary position good love from hybrid hubby Michael Corvin (the horrible, godawful, still annoying-as-ever Scott Speedman), maybe buying a ranch-home in Colorado and having a couple kids and a family dog.<br /><br />Sure. If you want to see daylight and get a tan, sweetheart, try a tanning bed.<br /><br />2) Nobody seems to be having any damned fun in the world of "Underworld: Underworlder"---and that's really a shame. What's the point of living forever if you're not going to loosen up and enjoy yourself? All we have is War, War, War.<br /><br />Look: if I'm a vampire, I'm not gonna hunker down in some stinky, squalid, dim-lit bunker arsenal, fidgeting and twitching about getting it on with the hairy gang down the block. And---anyone?---why are we all hanging around freezing our undead butts off in the Czech Republic, anyway?<br /><br />Nobody seems to be having any fun in "Underworld": certainly not vampires Selene or her black-eyed buddy Corvin, nor poor vamp pater-familias Alex(Derek Jacobi, who prisses around in what looks like the castoff duds from "Shakespeare in Love" before dying like an ineffective, whimpering little b*tch), and certainly not uber-vamp-flappy-thingy Marcus (Tony Curran).<br /><br />Indeed, the only guy living it up with chicks and booze and rock n' roll is Andreas Tanis, and he's a hated exile living in prison, who is quickly and nastily put down like a sick dog. I rest my case.<br /><br />3) Look, if you're a batwinged-flappy thing (Marcus) or his 10-foot-high lupine brother ummm, William, don't flap or stalk out in front of a high-velocity machine-gun and just hover/stand there. Not a good career move. Very damaging to the pelt.<br /><br />Now, don't misunderstand me: Underworld: Deader" isn't without some hair of the dog that bit me---the opening carnage in a snowbound medieval village between a troop of vampires and their hairy buddies is gorgeous, slickly shot, and caked with blood and gore.<br /><br />And the backstory---a ravenous, blood-hungry werewolf entombed in a fortress-prison designed for him---is delicious. And the trappings here are ultra-glossy and very slick, whether it's some long-deserted oubliette or high-tech battle gear.<br /><br />And hell, at some point---and I confess, I was pretty liquored up by the end of "Underworld: Catsuit", so this might not actually have happened---someone brought a helicopter to the gunfight. Seriously. Oh, and a decent amount of the red sauce is spilled.<br /><br />But in the end, Wiseman has traded the politics of betrayal that infused the first flick with a little dignity for the wham-bam action wild rumpus of a chase flick: monster breaks out of prison, monster chases heroes, heroes chase monster, big-a**ed battle, close credits.<br /><br />And frankly, it's just not all that interesting to watch. With that in mind: does anyone think the DVD cover art makes it look like Selene is holding twin scalpels? And does anyone think that might have made for a better movie?<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ok....Just"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of the original series.I expected a very good movie here.I thought they had found a good character to play Maxwell Smart in Steve Carell.But i think the script itself was a bit lacking something.Also it was annoying to see other people play the parts of the original characters who did not resemble them one iota.It seemed they were trying a modern approach,that to me simply didn't work.I started off enjoying it but half an hour or so into it, i was beggining to wonder.I wouldn't say i hated it,but at the same time i don't think i would watch it again for a while.</p></body></html>

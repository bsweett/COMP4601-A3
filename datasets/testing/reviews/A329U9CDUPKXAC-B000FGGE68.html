<meta name="summary" content="Well I thought it was good"></head><body><p>I was expecting this movie to be crap. But I think it was really good. I loved the stylish look of the film. It's not at all realistic but then it's not really cartoony either. It's like it exists in it's own world and it looks great. The action scenes were very well done. Not all dumb looking like in Aeon Flux. The one thing I didn't like was the, at times, confusing story. And the fact that this woman was practically invincible. That kind of takes away suspense. But this movie was a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

Still, I did enjoy the beginning and ending of DEAD SILENCE very much. As for the middle part, well, it got a little long and drawn out for me. I don't particularly care for Donnie Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher), and he did nothing spectacular here. As I said, I liked the weird, NIGHT GALLERY-esque beginning a lot. It made me think the rest of the movie would be a nice late night treat. It was the mainly un-frightening mid-section of DS that lowered my expectations. However, that ending was a true jaw dropper, much like SAW (by the same folks) before it, I was left w/ a smile on my face. So, my advice is to watch the opening closely, do a crossword puzzle or sudoku during the middle part, and stare wide-eyed at the climax. It sort of makes the whole thing worth while...</p></body></html>

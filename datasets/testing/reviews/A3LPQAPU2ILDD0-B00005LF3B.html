<meta name="summary" content="How Soon Our Lives Can Be Put On Hold"></head><body><p>An extremely dedicated FedEx man finds his whole reason for being, totally interrupted in a matter of minutes. With one of the best and most believable crash sequences ever put on film, were gone the love-of-his-life and his career. In no particular order. Tom Hank's characters always seem to pull the audience in, making us care about what happens to them. The sounds of being stranded on a desert island, waves hitting the sand, give that sense of realism and feeling all alone. Great effort from the sound effects crew. And after too many years in isolation, he pretty much loses it with the loss of his one companion "Wilson".<br /><br />I guess the one complaint expressed by many, not myself, was the even bigger disappointment he suffered after returning to civilization. Extremely touching, with the falling rain a symbol of the many years of tears and separation. But there is also the positive side. An ending with the hope of a new beginning.<br /><br />A film I can watch over-and-over again. Once again, a brilliant collaboration for actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis.</p></body></html>

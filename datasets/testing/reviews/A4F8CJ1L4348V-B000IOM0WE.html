<meta name="summary" content="Great movie for any sci-fi fan"></head><body><p>This is a really fun sci-fi movie to watch. This is a different story than movie in this genre and is a solid one at that. I did like the action of the "heroin" and does break all of the "sterotypes" of the "weak" woman figure. Bravo to the writer and director of this film for building a solid story with a strong woman as the heroin. The special effects were excellent in this movie as well as the acting of the actors. I do recommend this movie to anyone that loves sci-fi flicks with a little twist to the story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Prince Caspian"></head><body><p>In 'Prince Caspian' we return to an altered and savage Narnia and more fantasy adventure to delight the family. You get great affects, battle scenes, talking animals and a pretty close rendition of the book. I have to say that I found this more enjoyable than 'The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' with the slightly darker elements to the story fitting the fantasy adventure theme a lot better. The children stars of this film annoy me as actors and Prince Caspians accent reminded me of Puss in Boots from Shrek at times, but overall the acting was OK and didn't detract from the story. It manages to achieve what it set out to, that is, a fun family adventure and manages to keep you interested and watching for the duration, which didn't feel overly long as the story kept pushing forward. A good film that is worth watching if you were a fan of the first installment or of fantasy films in general.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

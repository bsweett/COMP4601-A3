<meta name="summary" content="Denzel Washington more or less redeems this very unoriginal film"></head><body><p>The world following the apocalypse has become a nearly barren desert, populated by loosely knit groups of humans who cling to survival with dirty talons, and make little effort to cling to civilization.  Many drive modified motorcycles.  Into this desolation wanders a lonely figure, reluctantly on a journey that urges him to disassociate from humanity in favor of headlong movement across the landscape.  He is also a ferocious fighter when he needs to be, and under the hard exterior is capable of feeling a need for companionship and meaning.<br /><br />Nope, I'm not describing THE ROAD WARRIOR.  I'm not talking about THE ROAD.  I'm talking about the very unoriginal THE BOOK OF ELI, starring Denzel Washington as the mysterious man Eli who is compelled to walk ever Westward across a landscape wrecked by nuclear war...where there are few survivors and many of them have turned to cannibalism.  He carries a book with him that is unique in what is left of mankind, and he believes that he must deliver this into the right hands.<br /><br />On his path, he is frequently beset by violence...but fortunately, he has almost superhuman hand-to-hand fighting skills (and a very sharp sword), so that he can easily defeat 6 or more hardened, experienced fighting men in about 20 seconds flat.<br /><br />He wanders into a town, where the self-appointed mayor (Gary Oldman) happens to be looking for the very book that Eli happens to be carrying.  Eli escapes, but is accompanied (much to his chagrin) by a spunk young lady (Mila Kunis) who is drawn to Washington's gentleness and probably by a chance to "see the world."  The two must fight off efforts to bring them back to this town, save the book and deliver it to the location Eli feels God has told him to bring it.<br /><br />ELI is filmed in a washed out, sepia-toned manner, and is virtually devoid of any other color.  There are lots of shots of Eli moving across the barren land, and plenty of moments where he just stands in place and looks cool.  Denzel Washington has charisma to burn, and it is this charisma that makes the film watchable.  We immediately take to this quiet, mysterious man...because we immediately are drawn to Washington.  Washington talks very little, and except for two or three short bursts of action...seems to DO very little.  Yet he's fairly riveting, and that's due simply to his presence.  He doesn't so much give a performance as he gives a persona.<br /><br />Were a lesser actor than Washington in this film, it would just be a slow-moving, sepia colored, B-level post-apocalyptic chore of a movie.  There's very little that's honestly original, and surprisingly little actual action.  I expected more fighting, but got very little when it was all said and done.  Gary Oldman, who has been such a great villain over the years, really never makes much of a foreboding presence.  We get that he's a bit crazy and a lot dangerous, but it feels vague and unspecific.  Surprisingly, Jennifer Beals makes a nice impression as Oldman's "girlfriend" and Mila Kunis' mother.  Kunis is working up an interesting film resume, having been credible now in things as diverse as ELI & FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.  I'm not ready to put her on the A-list yet, but I also never thought the kid who played Jackie on THAT `70s SHOW would have a viable film career.  She's actually pretty good, and towards the end of the film, has some nice moments with Washington which finally give the film a long overdue shot of human emotion.<br /><br />In the end, your enjoyment of this movie will depend a lot on how much you like either a) Washington or b) post-apocalyptic films, no matter how derivative of far better films.  While I didn't mind the time I spent watching THE BOOK OF ELI...my time would have been better spent re-watching THE ROAD WARRIOR...the film that after all these years is STILL the gold-standard in this little subgenre.</p></body></html>

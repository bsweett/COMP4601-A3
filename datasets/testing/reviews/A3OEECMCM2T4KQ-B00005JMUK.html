<meta name="summary" content="The Creation of a Killer"></head><body><p>If there was ever a more deserved academy award for a lead dramatic performance, Charlize Theron as serial killer, Aileen Wuormos, it most certainly is this one. Take away the latex, make-up and false teeth, the extra thirty pounds and damaged blond hair, and you would still have the unnerving personification of this tragic woman.<br /><br />This dark tale, based on a true story, is disturbing on many levels. The character of Aileen Wuormos, on one level, is a terrible indictment of a compassionless society. A more accurate title for this film would be, "The Making of a Serial Killer." Aileen Wuormas was sexually abused as a young child by one of her father's best friends, and then beaten severely by her father for telling him. In effect, this little child was raped on a continual basis throughout puberty. Forced on the street at thirteen years of age, she turns to prostitution, and lives her life in this manner for the rest of her days. As the character states at one point in the film, no one knows what life is like as a homeless person and a prostitute, unless you are one, it is not an easy life, taking a tremendous amount of will to survive, but if it's the only thing you know to survive, you keep doing it.<br /><br />In a seeming compassionless world, she meets a lonely young woman who reaches out to her. Selby (Christina Ricci) is a lovely enough girl, naive and inexperienced, but is weak, incapable of action, and utterly dependent. Though for the strong and independent Aileen, a perfect partner to care for and love. This is a complicated relationship, but in the end, a transparent one.<br /><br />The turning point in the film, and for Aileen Wuormos, is the unmentionable incident, where she's beaten, made a prisoner, and horrifically raped. To save her life she retaliates as any person in the same situation would, killing her assailant. This sets her off onto a killing spree across Florida, assassinating Johns, found in compromising positions. When she finally confesses to Selby about the murders, her justification is,<br /><br />"Everybody out there is killing and raping, and I'm the one out there killing them".<br /><br />There is no justifying murder in any situation, unless in self defence, or in the organised arena of war, but writer/director, Patty Jenkins, has endeavoured to reveal to us another side, and that is a victim living on raw hopes and dreams that are continually crushed, unleashing a response, an almost primeval reaction of extreme violence.<br /><br />This is a film that I would have no desire to see again, though brilliant, once is enough, as it is such a tragedy.</p></body></html>

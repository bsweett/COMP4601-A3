<meta name="summary" content="You'll never entertain adultery after seeing this film"></head><body><p>2005's "Derailed" tells the story of a man (Clive Owen) who's obviously lost passion for his wife and is dealing with the stress of a daughter with serious medical problems. On the train to work he starts a relationship with a woman (Jennifer Aniston) which slowly veers toward adultery. Things go from bad to worse. Vincent Cassel is featured as the love-to-hate villain.<br /><br />I mainly judge films by whether or not they pull you in and hold your attention. "Derailed" does this in spades. I was also impressed with the writing. Although another reviewer panned the writing as "unbelievable tripe" and "horribly written" the story struck me in a totally opposite manner. Okay, maybe parts of the story are unbelievable, in particular the ending's prison surprise, but how many movies today are truly believable? Some have criticized the story as predictable but I was surprised and impressed by the turns the film takes. And I never saw it coming.<br /><br />I'm not going to say anymore because the less you know the better. Stay away from the reviews that (without warning) give away the entire plot!<br /><br />"Derailed" is a top-of-the-line thriller/drama.</p></body></html>

Jackman and Bale are great, they have amazing chemistry, you can feel the loathing and admiration between the two of them, the hate each other, yet are drawn together by their love of magic and one uping and humilating the other.  This movie is good from start to finish and the twist at the end is fantastic, im not sure the best man won, but you can judge for yourself.  Highly recommended: great movie.</p></body></html>

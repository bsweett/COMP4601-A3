<meta name="summary" content="A fun adventure full of classic monsters"></head><body><p>Watching this movie I don't know why it's hated by so many. I watched the Day After Tomorrow yesterday and watched Van Helising today. I must say that Van Helsing is much funner movie and the one I'd want to watch more than once. People knock it for having so much action, well isn't that good ? I mean to me that made it entertaining through-out and it was never dull. I actually saw a 1 out of 10 review for this at igndvd.com and no way is this movie that bad. Maybe I liked it because I always wanted a movie with all the classic monsters together. I think Stephen Sommers does a pretty damn good job making adventures though. I actually liked the Mummy movies and if you liked those then you should be blown away by Van Helsing. I also really liked the look of the film, it a has a really nice classic monster movie look to it. Plus Hugh Jackman does a fine job in the title role, but when isn't he good ? It's just Dracula that I had a problem with, he's not that scary plus they needed a better actor playing him. Dougray Scott (Mission Impossible 2) who was originally supposed to play Wolverine in X-Men would've made a much better dracula. Kate Beckinsale  doesn't give the best performance either but hell I wasn't listening to her talk, was too busy drooling over her out-fit lol.</p></body></html>

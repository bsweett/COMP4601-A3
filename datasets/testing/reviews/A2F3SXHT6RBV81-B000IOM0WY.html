<meta name="summary" content="Is L. A. in Italy?"></head><body><p>Even though this movie starts out in Venice, with motorboat chases down the canals following an ultra modern heist of gold bars worth 35 million dollars, most of the action takes place out in California.  There really is not much Italian about this job; even the funky music is pure L.A. -- not easy on the ears or senses.  It is pretty weird with lots of noise but not much taste.<br /><br />The dialogue isn't much, either.  Seth Green of WITHOUT A PADDLE fame was the best of the bunch, as the computer wiz Napster.  He looks so much like Michael Feinstein, it is a joy to watch his antics.  They use cell phones and computers which I know were not in the original 1969 version starring Michael Caine who was the original 'Alfie.'<br /><br />The weird looking cars (mini Coopers) red, white and blue were something like the teen races in 'Rebel Without A Cause' and 'Grease.'  They maneuvered down on the Metro underground tracks and through storm drain tunnels to escape the black helicopter after a fashion.<br /><br />We see the famous junkyard run by the Italians where the garbage men are warned by a 400-lb. Oriental or Ukranian (take your pick).  The first attempt to recover the gold which is left -- 208 bricks worth 27 million had to be aborted because of a neighbor's large party in the gated and guarded grand mansions.<br /><br />There was nothing poetic about this bunch of international criminals.  The helicopter flew right past the Hollywood hill sign, Hotel Roosevelt, and Chinese Theatre.  The traffic jams caused by a malfunction at the Traffic Control Center showed some buses; #2636 looked like the old white borrowed vehicles KAT has from Worchester, Mass.  The mini cars are driven into a cattle car attached to the Union Pacific train and off they go into the wild blue yonder.<br /><br />It could have been a western except for the Big Brother cameras out on the freeway.</p></body></html>

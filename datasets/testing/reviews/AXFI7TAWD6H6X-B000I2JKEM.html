His last foray into stop-animation was with the classic "The Nightmare Before Christmas". I loved the unique animation and the delightful storyline. I was hoping that Tim would capture that same magic again. I was not disappointed with his latest foray into animation "Corpse Bride".<br /><br />Tim Burton brings together a dazzling cast of actors some of which he has worked with in the past like Johnny Depp ("Edward Scissorhands", "Sleepy Hollow", "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"), Helena Bonham Carter ("Big Fish"), and Albert Finney ("Big Fish"). Johnny is the voice over for the protagonist of the film Victor Van Dort. His parents (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) had set Victor up to be married to Victoria (Emily Watson), the daughter of the high society couple Everglots who are now penniless. On the day of the wedding rehearsal, Victor is so nervous that he cannot recite his vows correctly and is sent away by the pastor. Victor ends up in a forest and unwittingly says his vows correctly and winds up being the husband of a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). During his absence a mysterious man named Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) makes a play for Victoria.<br /><br />What first attracted me to this film is the animation. I loved the shape of the characters' facial features and their pasty white skin. I especially liked the color of Emily's blue hair. I also loved the design of the skeletonal characters. The deep rich dark hues of the settings was visually pleasing to this viewer's eyes.<br /><br />I personally like the storyline very engaging. This film turned out that it isn't scary. It is very whimsical. The few flaws to this film is: a) too many musical numbers. Some worked, some didn't. I found a few quite annoying and to be a big detriment to the film. What worked the best was the simple piano score that had the most impact on me. And b)the attempts at humor were half-hearted at best. It is either going to be a comedy or isn't. For all its flaws, "Corpse Bride" was whimsical escape for me from reality. To put it simply, I loved it.</p></body></html>

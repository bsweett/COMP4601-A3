<meta name="summary" content="After 12 years, the film still entertains despite a few flaws."></head><body><p>It has been 12 years since Braveheart won the Academy Award for best picture and a release on DVD allows us to review this film in 2007 to determine its continued merit. Does it measure up?<br /><br />Yes and No.<br /><br />I gave the film 4 stars because on the whole the film remains strong after 12 years. The scenes of the Scotish landscape and weather conditions were highly realistic and beautiful. The architectural structures, whether they were peasant huts or fortress castles, were very impressive and facilitated the plot and mood of the film in a way that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy captures 7 years later after the release of Braveheart. The filth of common life in 1290 is captured well, for even the highest nobility were vermin infested and encrusted with dirt. The acting of Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was superb, the best acting job in the whole film. Catherine McCormack as Murron and Sophie Marceau as French Princess Isabella were both excellent casting choices for while both beautiful, McCormack captures the beauty of a strong healthy peasant while Marceau captures the worldly sophisticated beauty of a woman destined for power.  The cinematography was exceptional. One final strength to the film that is certainly relevant to our time, which is that battle against native insurgency is never predictable. Longshanks was extremely lucky that for the most part the Scottish insurgency was willing to fight him face to face in traditional warfare (at least for that time and place) rather than engage in underground gurilla warfare, which is often the choice of insurgent populations.<br /><br />What are the drawbacks?<br /><br />First, considerable historic license was taken to make the film more dramatic and romantic than history would indicate was the actual sequence of events. Second, the violence was a bit over-the-top with terrible scenes of torture and warfare. Third, Gibson was 20 years older than the young William Wallace who began his campaign when he was between 20 and 24 and died before he was 36. Fourth, the film is actually a bit too long. It is a 3 hour film that could have been shortened to 2 hours with little lost in terms of story or atmosphere. The fifth drawback is that by today's standards, the depiction of King Edward I could be seen as homophobic. History would imply that King Edward I was homosexual, but this film equates homosexuality with physical and emotional weakness.<br /><br />Overall, the film holds up to time and remains entertaining after 12 years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why do I like it? Because it's dark and hellish . . ."></head><body><p>I half excected to dislike this film, because I was a bit skeptical about Rob Zombie as a director. But after watching it, I actually liked it. The film is an extreme horrorfest, filled with excessive gore and disturbing settings. And when I mean excessive, I mean it conveys a no-holds-barred attitude. It's gory entertainment for those who can actually take it. Plus, it's severely dark and hellish, so it's not for those who are very squeamish. Personally, I thought that this film was good. Not excellent, but good enough to keep me interested. Although it may not achieve classic status like The Exorcist or Nightmare on Elm Street, I still like it for its overall gore and psychotic atmosphere.<br /><br />In short, Rob Zombie has given us an entertaining horror film that would most certainly please a large percentage of horror fans; it did for me. I have never seen both versions of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I do believe this might be even better than Chainsaw (but my opinion will probably change if I ever see any of them). Next up: The Devil's Rejects!</p></body></html>

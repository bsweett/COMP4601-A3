<meta name="summary" content="WHY DID THE DOG GROWL?"></head><body><p>"Mysterious Gothic feel" is a buzz phrase for "poor lighting" because the special effects weren't that great. The acting was good and the story line was just fine. The movie was ruined by 19th century novelist dialogue that better fit a Jane Austin novel than a Gothic horror. The scenes tended to be dark to hide the fact the special effects have not improved since "American Werewolf in London." Lawrence Talbot is told by his brother's fiancee that he is missing. Talbot returns home only to find out his brother has been found dead, ripped to pieces. The movie is a complete bore until Talbot gets bitten by a werewolf and survives (not unexpected in a werewolf story). He then walks through the house and the dog growls at him. He stops as if he knows this is some kind of sign he is a werewolf. The scene would have worked except the dog growled at him all the time before he was bit and also (mini-plot spoiler) lives with Talbot's dad who is also a werewolf (revealed about half way through if you hadn't figured it out before hand). The gypsy woman which was great in the 1941 master piece is reduced to a minor character. Hugo Weaving plays a Scotland Yard investigator, thinks the killings that happen while Lawrence Talbot was away was caused by him, another bad plot element, which made as much sense as the dog growling. The werewolves in this movie just don't kill one guy and are done for the night, rather they go on senseless killing sprees. As in most werewolf movies the action jumps from full moon to full moon, which seem to come at an incredible rate.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Dreamers Exhaust Us . . .""></head><body><p>"Dreamers exhaust us," says Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins, looking like an elderly Yoda at the library in Alexandria), "we must kill them before their dreams kill us all."  Call me crazy, but I loved ALEXANDER.  I went in with incredibly low expectations based on dismal reviews, and instead I wound up sitting there with my hand frozen halfway to my mouth, fist stuffed with popcorn, not moving a muscle until the picture was over.  The movie may be "bad," but it's bad in a personal way, with lots of colorful sequences and some camp howlers that just move the action along as vigorously as anything De Mille could have turned out in his hey day.  If you thought the acting was bad in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, and yet you can't stop watching that picture every Easter, you will be crying with joy when you see ALEXANDER, nearly as long and twice as pagan.  Colin Farrell looks so young at first--he's good playing 19 or 20, and it's only when he ages that his acting starts falling apart.  I thought Angelina Jolie was fantastic, unashamed of her part, putting herself into it with her whole heart and soul.<br /><br />She looks wonderful, even when dozens of white, pasty slugcolored snakes writhe and wrap around her marvelous body--were these all CGI or did she actually work with them?  She certainly gives the impression of a mother whose priorities were 1) having fun with snakes and 2) the welfare of Alexander.  Val Kilmer was great, whether he was trying to rape Olympias or taking little Alex through a mural tour of the great heroes of Greek history--Oedipus, Prometheus, Medea, no one was spared.  The actor who plays Bagoas or whatever his name was--the boy who looks like a girl--has the strangest body, and both he and Rosario Dawson, who plays Roxana, Alexander's barbarian bride, seem to be in a competition for who can cast smoldering looks the furthest.<br /><br />All the actors really threw themselves over the cliff in this one, and I as a movie goer appreciated it, there's too much irony in the movies nowadays and hardly anyone gives that kind of balls to the wall performance like they used to.  Well here there are at least a dozen of them, and Colin Farrell's thighs are serious competition to all the other best supporting actor nominees of 2004.  I also liked the way Oliver Stone told the story so that none of the central questions of the film are ever answered and we are thrust back onto the prongs of our own curiosity about this marvelous "Mager Alexandrum."</p></body></html>

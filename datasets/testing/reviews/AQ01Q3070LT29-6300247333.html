<meta name="summary" content="It's a fight between Damien and Jesus the Christ."></head><body><p>When we last left Damien in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00096S48K">Damien: Omen 2</a> (1978), he had killed his cousin Mark and later his adopted uncle's second wife, Ann who was really his protecter.<br />  In the second film, Damien discovered he was the Antichrist and did have the birthmark of "666" on the crown of his head.<br />  Now Damien Thorn (Sam Neill) is a 32-year old adult and severely dangerous.  Come hell or high water, he will become the Ambassador of Great Britian.<br />  Damien currently works for the President of the United States (Mason Adams).  The devil dog tranfixes the United States Ambassador (Robert Arden). He walks into his office and a 3:00pm is shot by a boobytrap he made himself. (The most horrifying and grossest scene in any film ever made).<br />  The President makes Damien the new Ambassador to the Court of St. James and also the President of the United Nations Youth Council.  Well now, Damien's devilish plan is now in place.<br /> Meanwhile, an astronomic event, a once in a lifetime event, is about to occur.  Three stars have been gradually traveling closer to each other for decades.  These three stars will align perfectly (Trinity) on March 24.  This could be the Second Coming of Christ and Damien will be there.<br />  This could be the fight to the end on Resurection Day.<br />  Tommy Duggan, who played a priest in the first movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ARDBWG">The Omen [Blu-ray</a>] (1976), plays "Brother Mattius" in this third film.<br />  Sam Neill was so effective in this role, I could not and would not watch him in another film for 23 years.<br />  DVD includes Audio Commentary, Trailers for THE OMEN (1976), DAMIEN: OMEN II (1978), OMEN 3: THE FINAL CONFLICT (1981).<br /><br />  Followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X75HY">Omen IV - The Awakening</a> (1991-tv).<br />  Remake: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCO87W">The Omen (Widescreen Edition)</a> was released June 06, 2006. (666)<br /><br />Just remember the devil's number is 6, but God's number is 7.  God is always one ahead of the devil.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The terrorism: the invisible enemy!"></head><body><p>The violence is part of the human nature. Gaston Bouthoul' s impressive  essay published in the early seventies brings us forth interesting information; the major interval of peace along the mankind's history has been of two hundred years and along the 5000 years of history there just have been 400 years of absolute peace. The conclusion is more than obvious. The peace is a nostalgic idea, a marvelous product of the syncretism, conceived as the final sum of fragmented hopes, and has nothing to do with the human race. And Voltaire's acidic statement: "The civilization doesn't suppress the incivility, it just improves it."<br /><br />If you expected just an incendiary movie, take your time and make a pause on the road. Spielberg' s approach turns around the slow and progressively psychological fragmentation of every one of the components of the apparently epic team that were hired to exterminate one by one the eleven intellectual leaders hat planned the unforgettable massacre in Munich 1972.<br /><br />So, under the perspective of more than thirty four years, the movie is a very zealous examination - told in documental style, through dramatic narrative ellipsis - around the dreadful events which took place with all the possible crudeness.<br /><br />According these established premises this handful of men will be hired in order to search and eliminate around every corner of Europe one by one the eleven terrorists. Despite certain inconsistencies in the script, we will witness how every one of the members of the Quintet simply will give up with such violence amount.<br /><br />Our main hero - Avner Kauffman - is happily married and his Jewish ancestors impede him to understand the huge challenge that this operation means. At the end he refuses to continue in this operation and he has realized the shed blood will not redeem the fallen victims; and on the other hand the violence is endless, that's why he simply decides to stop and initiate a new life with his wife and beautiful daughter in the Bronx. Ironically, in the final shot the fixed camera shows us the World Trade Center.<br /><br />No terrorism has philosophical justification. On the other hand the violence has no face, walks with velvet steps in order to select randomly some place in the world to make his designs come true. So under these coordinates, you fight against an invisible enemy, masked and hidden under the most unexpected conditions and keeping this paranoid state in the most people.<br /><br />Maybe this pacific statement in the final dialogue, advocating for the irrationality of this bloody revenge, was very brief leaving in the spectator's taste an unfinished anguish and a lot of unanswered questions. Perhaps this was the final intention; to make us understand the no sense of the revenge, but this is simply the edge of the iceberg. Don' t you?</p></body></html>

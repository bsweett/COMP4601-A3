<meta name="summary" content="An Outstanding Gangland Epic..."></head><body><p>In the 1970's director Francis Ford Coppola treated audiences with possibly the most accurate, yet somewhat romanticized, depiction of life in the mafia with his brilliant films "The Godfather" and "The Godfather 2". Ever since those two movies, no other movie has come close to touching the quality that is displayed in these two films for this genre, some have tried and come close ("The Godfather 3" being chief among them), but none have succeeded. That is until director Martin Scorsese released his biopic on the life of mobster Henry Hill with "Goodfellas".<br /><br />"Goodfellas" follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a small-time hood who happens to participate in a robbery with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), calm and calculating individual, and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), a psycho with an incredibly short fuse. Little did Henry know that this robbery would place him on the path to becoming a 'made man' in the very mafia family that Jimmy Conway eventually becomes head of. As Henry Hill rises through the ranks of 'La Cosa Nostra' he manages to find some peace and stability when he meets a young Italian woman (Lorraine Braco) that he marries and has a few kids with. However, the excesses of mafia life eventually begin to get the better of Henry, as he begins to unravel due to heavy drug use, and making matters worse his one-time friend and Don, Jimmy Conway believes Henry may be a threat to him and plots to 'whack' him. With his life in possible jeopardy, Henry has two choices, one stay true to the family and face possible execution, or two, become a government informant and be placed into Witness Protection, becoming a rat in the eyes of the 'family'.<br /><br />Director Martin Scorsese's work here is by far some of his best. His gritty, realistic approach to this true story, really shows the audience the great wealth and success (if you can call it that) that mafia life can have, while at the same time showing the pitfalls that can occur in that same life. The cast that Scorsese has managed to bring together for this film is truly excellent, and the performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta are so powerful, and at times scary, that you can really appreciate the great talent that these actors possess. The supporting cast is equally talented, and just as worthy of praise as the three leads. An interesting note is that for his role of the psychotic Tommy DeVito, Joe Pesci improvised some of the more extreme moments the character has, earning him great critical praise and somewhat typecasting him in this type of role. The story is an excellent cautionary tale on what can happen when your choices lead you on the wrong path, even though it's the only path you ever dreamed of. The movie is probably just as strong as "The Godfather", maybe even stronger due to it's even greater authenticity and lack of romanticizing life in the mafia. For those moviegoers that enjoy mafia themed movies, but have never seen this gangster classic, you must do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />"Goodfellas" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/brief nudity.</p></body></html>

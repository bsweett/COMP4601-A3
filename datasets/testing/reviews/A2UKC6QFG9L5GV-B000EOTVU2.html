Well, the beginning is rather long indeed, but it's in no way boring. It's utterly intense - not by the amount of action going on on screen but psychologically intense. I can't recall any films I saw lately I was feeling myself so uneasy about. These first 30 or 40 minutes (I don't remember exactly) when "nothing happens" fill you with such dread of something inevitable that's going to happen, I found them enormously disturbing.<br /><br />When the situation begins to evolve "Wolf Creek" turns into a usual "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" type of a movie, but it's still very well done. Intense cat-mouse game, no foolish actions from the main characters who try to escape death... I was impressed especially given the fact it's an Australian, low-budget flick. Maybe it's not as powerful as Alexandre Aja's "High Tension" and not as mindblowing as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (and I doubt any movie can top this one speaking of viciousness), but it definately stands in one line with "Wrong Turn", "House of 1000 corpses" and so on (unfortunately I haven't seen the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes" yet). Maybe it's not your cup of tea, but "Wolf Creek" is perfect to spend your evening with if you like thrills. And if you are deeply into horror films, you won't regret if you buy it for your collection.</p></body></html>

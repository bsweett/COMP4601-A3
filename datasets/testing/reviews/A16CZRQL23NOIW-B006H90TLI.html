<meta name="summary" content="A new approach about violence and  ontological solitude"></head><body><p>All of us are well aware about the artistic trajectory of the Coen Brothers doen't obey to prefixed canons, somehow they represent for the American nation what Fassbinder for German, the voice of an ethic conscious.<br /><br />The graphic violence is just an excuse to get into the unsaid desperation of a handful of human beings who are living the golden ages, but told from a bitter perspective; the future of these people is full of clouds and uncertainness.<br /><br />Perhaps since the times of  midnight cowboy we had not witnessed a film burdened of so many questions without answers, a demolishing vision about the last stage of our life. A film that certainly will endure as one of the most nature and devastating among the great winners.<br /><br />Javier Bardem is terrific as the psychopath, who deliberately exterminates one by one (and specially to citizens of the third age) that may become an obstacle in his pursuit.</p></body></html>

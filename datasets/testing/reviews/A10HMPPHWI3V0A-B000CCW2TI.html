<meta name="summary" content="Suspenceful little Thriller from Wes Craven"></head><body><p>Over the years I have been more than a little bit dissapointed with Wes Craven Directoral works, it's not that I thought that he had lost his edge or ability but more that he was just in some what of a slump, though the movie was not flawless or spectacular like "A Nightmare On Elm Street", "The People Under the Stairs" or the "Scream' trilogy, it was simply a good prototype of an exciting thriller. Obviously Mr. Craven changes his movie making style to a more suspenful thriller type and somewhat leaves behind his slasher roots, I think one of the reasons that I was so pleased after seeing this movie was because I thought that it might be bad just like every other movie he has made since ... well ... "Scream", I mean come one have any of you people seen "They" or "Cursed" ..... BARF!<br /><br />One of "Red Eyes" strengths was it's cast, Rachel McCadams was very good in playing the lead role while Cillian Murphy nails his first shot at being a Villian, (I mean he is interesting enough trust me when I say that he is a very believable in this role), not only the to lead charactors but as a whole everyone did their part to make this movie successful.<br /><br />Something that did bother me SOMEWHAT was that the movie seemed way too short ... I thought that if the movie would have been a little bit longer, the middle of the film and the climatic ending could have been even more suspencful, thrilling and even all around better as a film.<br /><br />I thought that the story line was very well put together even though it was pretty cleshea, everything seemed to fall in place pretty well and there was alot of falling action that led up to the climax very well. I think one more bad thing about this film is it's predictability<br /><br />Overall I must say that I was pretty impressed with Wes Cravens new style and directoral effort in this roller coaster suspence ride ... I hope that "Red Eye" will lead to more good films by Craven the near future, Recommended to all ... well most.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nuclear Annihilation Has Never Been So Funny, Or It is Not Only Hilarious, It Is Horrific"></head><body><p>I never imagined that anyone could successfully satirize a subject as scary and gruesome such as nuclear war and destruction.  While it isn't as prevalent as it was during the Cold War, the threat still exists, and it is a scary one.  And yet, Stanley Kubric's Dr. Strangelove is a perfectly good example of a satirical look at such a subject.<br /><br />Filmed in black and white, the movie chronicles a few hours in the worst day in human history.  A high-ranking United States general, General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden), has recently gone insane with rage, paranoia, and fear of the Soviets.  He has decided to execute an order reserved for sneak attacks; basically, in the event of a surprise attack on Washington, D.C., it allows someone besides the president to authorize the use of nuclear weapons.  He quarantines the entire base, making everyone believe that they are under attack, and the only person who sees through the madness is his executive officer, British officer Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers).<br /><br />Meanwhile, President Merkin Muffley (Sellers) has called a conference of top US generals, including Gen. Bucky Turgidson (George C. Scott), Russian ambassador Sadesky (Peter Bull), and German nuclear expert Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again).  While at the conference in an underground War Room, the president learns about the improbability of being able to call back the fighters, as well as the existence of a Russian doomsday device that cannot be shut down.<br /><br />While the president desperately attempts to call back the planes on their way to Russia, circumstances in the air make things even more complicated, one of which being that the pilot of one of the planes, Major T.J. "King" Kong (Slim Pickens) is extremely gung-ho about the mission.<br /><br />Many different aspects of the film are wonderfully used to satirize the situation.  From character names such as Kissov, "Bat" Guano, "King" Kong, Turgidson, and Strangelove, to the hilarious dialogue that has become some of the most famous lines that everyone knows, but doesn't know the origin.  Some of the famous lines include, "You can't fight in here!  This is the war room!".  Even some of the situations are priceless, such as the one involving Mandrake and the Coke machine.<br /><br />It truly is amazing how brilliant this movie is.  Never before have I laughed so hard at a subject that sends chills down my spine.  The whole film was very well executed, and is definitely worth a viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good"></head><body><p>Beautifully photographed. Well-acted.  A little too long with some pretty slow sections.  I personally felt little sympathy for McCandless - every bad thing that happened to him was his own fault.  But others might watch this film and feel quite differently.  How you feel about the character probably reveals a lot about your own value system.</p></body></html>

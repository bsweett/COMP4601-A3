He wasn't sure how he could handle Julie Taymor's interpretative take on the Beatles' music, but by the end of the movie he was all smiles.  She has done a magnificent job of rethinking what the Beatles were trying to do with their music, and yet by setting it in the sixties she seems to be underlining how very long ago it was!  I kept looking at the dingy, scarred up Manhattan pictured in the film and wondering how they could afford the budget they must have used to slum it down.  Same with Liverpool--could it really be as dire?  And yet the press materials the theater handed out insisted that the opening scenes were really shot in the Cavern Club and not some studio recreation.<br /><br />I loved the movie, but yeah, all through it I kept thinking that, even if it is not a disaster on the scale of that Robert Stigwood Sgt Pepper film, it certainly has script problems!  Evan Rachel Wood--love her, but she is not capable of playing the part of Lucy and convincing us of her passionate love for a boy killed in VietNam, her radicalization as a result of his death, or a growing comradeship with a charismatic movement leader.  She can sing, but her overenunciation reminds you of Julie Andrews or Barbra Streisand trying to go rock.  Wood is excellent however in her scenes with Jim Sturgess who plays Jude, but even there, the storyline sinks with predictable tension built into the storyline (as an allegory, I guess, for the way the 60s collapsed of their own weight).  Sturgess is enormously appealing when he smiles--a star is born--but when he's grim or trying to act tough forget it, it's not on his calendar.<br /><br />The other performers are very good but basically, script problems ruin the story.  The commune setup run by sexy landlady Sadie is cute but you've seen it all before done much better in HAIR and RENT.  Indeed ACROSS THE UNIVERSE should be paying HAIR and RENT royalties for all the setups the new film takes from these older touchstones (can't call them classics exactly).  The giant "I Want You" number just replays the title sequence in "Hair" of the draftees moving through the system in their undershorts, stripped of their human rights and turned into machines, though it adds a few surrealist touches like the scene in which GIs lift a statue of liberty onto the camouflaged jungles of VietNam.  There's also a Wall Street bit right out of HAIR, while the RENT parallels are too many to mention.  (Couldn't they have just hired Adam Pascal--Roger in RENT--to play Max in ATU, instead of directing poor Joe Anderson to mimic him in every single detail of acting, singing, tossing his hair?)  Nevertheless one watches the movie in fascination at so much daring, so much imagination, so much sheer Busky Berkeley craziness thrown up at the screen in a titanio effort to take you to a strawberry fields-like place in your mind.  For me it worked pretty much, but I wouldn't recommend it to any of the sophisticated people I know.</p></body></html>

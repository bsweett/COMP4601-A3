We had it figured out within the first 45 minutes, and then had endure the seemingly endless histrionics of the crazed Nicole Kidman, as she rushes from room to room to room in the big spooky house with all of the weird noises and voices etc etc etc...<p>After a point, all of the supposed buildup just gets tiresome.  The acting only serves to exhaust one's patience even further.  Kidman veers between brittleness and hysteria and simply wears the viewer out as a result.  As for the children, I was ready to tie rocks to them and drop down the well.  How irritating can they get?  That little boy has got to be one of the single most irritating actors to afflict the movie screen in decades.<p>If you want a truly creepy movie, watch &quot;The Innocents.&quot;  You won't know what the hell is going on, even when you are done, and as many questions remain at the end as at the beginning.  With &quot;The Others,&quot; the only question is why you would bother watching it in the first place.</p></body></html>

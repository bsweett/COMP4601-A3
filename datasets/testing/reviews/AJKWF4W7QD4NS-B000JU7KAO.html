Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water, I see plenty of words like "believe" and "underrated" in the postitive reviews of the film.  Well seriously folks, what is the point of trying to let your imagination run wild when the film itself is abysmal and crafted by an ego-maniac?  Contrary to many, I didn't hate his last film, the Village, like everyone else did, and as far as his previous films go, ranged from decent to excellent.  Which is why I'm scratching my head at Lady in the Water, because while it still features his stylish touch (somewhat), the story is ridiculously inane and non-sensical (I don't care if this is supposed to be a fairy tale or an homage to fairy tales, there are so many plot holes and leaps in logic that it just gets inexcusable), poor Paul Giamatti gets saddled with the hapless lead role and his talent is wasted to boot, and the rest of the cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard as the mythical creature and rising star Jeffrey Wright, range from wasted to annoying in their roles.  Not to mention that Shyamalan himself gives himself the most screen time he's had in any of his films, with the ego-mania just smoking off the screen.  Although the offing of a film critic offers some chuckles, Lady in the Water is an incredibly bad film that even the most die hard of Shyamalan fans will find hard to enjoy.  And as far as letting your imagination run wild, maybe we shuld all imagine that he had done a better film than this.</p></body></html>

Blade himself did a lot of funny and intense stuff, too. I thought the vampiress he became friends with was hot.  Oh, and the final fight with Reaper(who is my # 3 favorite Blade villain next to Deacon Frost and Dracula)was as good as they're gonna get. The only thing that could have made this movie better is  if it had the scariness and pumped vigor of the first one. Other than that, it is splendid, and I think any Blade fan should see it.</p></body></html>

Romero's midnight cult classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), you probably know the plot from the several remakes and sequels:  a small group of people barricade themselves inside a Midwest farm house one terrifying night while an army of flesh-eating zombies try to get inside the place.  The movie was filmed in and around Pittsburgh.  It is in gloriously nightmarish black-and-white, and the low-budget definitely adds to the chills.<br /><br />NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has been remade, and there are sequels to both the original film and the remake.  The original has been colorized and recut, with a prologue and happy ending added that Romero never intended.  There is only one version I know of to buy or rent--the Millenium Edition on DVD from Elite Entertainment, in B&W and remastered from the 35mm negative, running 96 minutes with no prologue and a profoundly unhappy ending.  It comes with comments from Stephen King, who notes how the original influenced a new breed of horror filmmakers, including Sam Raimi (THE EVIL DEAD trilogy) and John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN).  And Romero offers an introduction that appears to have been used on the original laserdisc about how this authorized 35mm edition looks and sounds better than even the original film did, with its 16mm drive-in circuit distribution.<br /><br />The movie has an unknown cast that includes Duane Jones as a black drifter, Judith O'Dea as a catatonic white blonde, Russell Streiner as Johnny the zombie, and Karl Hardman as hard-headed Mr. Cooper.  The small group of main actors doubles as producers and crew people, and the people of Pittsburgh must have had a lot of fun playing the zombies and reporters.  Pittsburgh is my Dad's home town, so NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of my favorite contemporary horror films.  Like Herk Harvey's brilliant CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), it has the look and feel of a nightmare that is hard to shake off.<br /><br />This is also one of the most important modern horror films.  As Stephen King notes, no one survives; it is a very bleak film.  There is no hero who lives to tell the tale.  A little zombie girl takes a bite out of her mother's arm before stabbing her repeatedly with a small garden shovel in the house basement.  Zombies keep coming back from the dead, even as Mr. Cooper throws molotov cocktails at them from an open window.  This is the ultimate midnight movie and still gets a Restricted "R" rating four full decades after its initial release.  It must really be something with an audience because it gave me strong nightmares even when watched alone in a night bedroom.<br /><br />George A. Romero himself made a superb sequel in 1980 called DAWN OF THE DEAD, with four main young people taking on motorcycle riding zombies armed with shotguns (!) in an all night suburban Pittsburgh shopping mall.  With good performances, a lively music score, color, and welcome dark comedy to go with grisly horror, DAWN OF THE DEAD is almost better than NIGHT.  Running over two hours, it is a horror epic.  As for the original NIGHT, if you like raw meat horror films with lots of gore and intense terror, this primal classic from the mind of visionary Romero should more than satisfy you.  So should DAWN OF THE DEAD.  More squeamish viewers should stay with the more subtle (I'm serious!) Alfred Hitchcock films and ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS television show episodes for Halloween season.<br /><br />Bonuses on the Millenium Edition DVD include trailers/TV spots, notes by Stephen King and filmmaker George A. Romero, scenes from a lost Romero film and the history of his company The Latent Image, and the hysterically funny parody short NIGHT OF THE LIVING BREAD. Pleasant dreams.</p></body></html>

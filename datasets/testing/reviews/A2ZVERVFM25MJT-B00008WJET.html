<meta name="summary" content="Best  comedy/spoof in years"></head><body><p>This excellent adaptation of the hit TV show is, quite simply, fantastic.  It's fast, furious and utterly ludicrous, but it's enormous fun.  The plot is based around voice recognition software so that the bad guy can find Charlie.  Of course, with such a amusingly blatant movie, who cares about plot?<p>The ex-pop video director cleverly hired a lot of good actors who are clearly having a whale of a time as they act out all of our fantasies - whether it's driving fast cars, sexy outfits or dancing on stage, it's all here.  Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are arguably the best of the bunch as nerdy Natalie and sexy Dylan.<p>The fact that it is just so blatant ensures that the audience knows that it is intentionally that way, defying those critics who were desperate to crawl all over it and tell us how terrible it is.  We get to see slow-mo shots as the girls take off their swimming costumes, cheesy smiles at the camera whilst flicking their hair back and stunts obviously inspired by 'The Matrix'.<p>Basically, 'Charlies Angels' won't change your world but then it was never supposed to and that's precisely why it succeeds.  There are plenty of funny throwaway lines - 'Oops I've come undone' - as well as good special effects and acting.  It works as a spoof, a comedy and a tease and gets a five-star rating in each.</p></body></html>

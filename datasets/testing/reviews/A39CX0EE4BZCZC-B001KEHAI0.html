I may check this out a fourth time, now that it's out on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The main role is perfect for Bill Murray, who is good at the playing a likable rogue, a guy always full of baloney but you don't seem to mind. The transformation of his personality is fun to watch in this film and gives it a sweet ending that was popular with audiences.<br /><br />You would think a movie with this plot - the same day reoccurring day after day - would grow thin in a hurry but it doesn't. The screenwriters and actors all made it clever and fun to view each "new day."<br /><br /> All the characters from Murray to female lead Andie MacDowell to the supporting actors do a great job of keeping the story fresh. Particularly funny was Stephen Tobolowsky, who portrays a nerdy insurance salesman. I liked Marita Geraghty, too, and it was fun to see Rick Ducommun again, my favorite actor from "The 'burbs."<br /><br />For a modern-day comedy, the language in here is very mild. The only drawback was seeing MacDowell's character compromise her wholesome values at the end.</p></body></html>

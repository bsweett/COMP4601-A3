<meta name="summary" content="A Treasure... no colorizing needed."></head><body><p>This movie is actually not as well known today as in the past.  Anyone who hasn't seen it, owes it to him/herself to do so.<br />This is listed as original and uncut.  Thank goodness, as versions I've seen on tv have often been cut to make room for way-too-many commercials.<br />Black + White is excellent, no colorization is needed.<br />[Most colorized B+W movies look like patches of color floating over the film, and are limited to aqua greens, light blues and browns.  Very odd.]<br />If you like this movie, don't fret over color or not, just get it. It's a treasure.</p></body></html>

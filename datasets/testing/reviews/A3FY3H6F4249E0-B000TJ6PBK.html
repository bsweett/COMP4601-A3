<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Scary Flick!"></head><body><p>I was really pleased to see this genuinely scary flick WITHOUT all the blood and guts and slashing and killing.  I am sooo sick of all that shock-value trash!  I want suspense.  I want to hear my heart thump because I don't know what's gonna happen next, and this is it!  This was a well done horror flick.  I watched it right before bedtime, so I had to have a little pep talk with myself before I went to sleep.<br /><br />John Cusack is outstanding in his role as Mike Enslin, a cynical hardened writer of mainly books that challenge "haunted" hotels.  Mike stays in the "haunted" room for the night, but never sees any ghosts.  Then he comes back and debunks the so-called haunted hotel.  Mike is a hardened soul who really doesn't seem to believe in anything, nor really care about anything since the death of his young daughter and the subsequent break up of his marriage.  You get the impression that his books aren't very good either.  He seems to have just kind of dried up inside.<br /><br />Anyway, Mike meets his match when he arrives at the Dolphin Hotel in New York, to stay at the alledged haunted room 1408.  Prior to his arrival, the Dolphin will not even accept a reservation from him for that room.  Upon his arrival and insistance, he is greeted by Samuel L. Jackson, the hotel manager.  Mr. Jackson tries everything to persuade Mike NOT to stay in 1408.  He even tells him the room is just "fxxxxxx" evil, but cannot convince cynical Mike. He shows him black and white photos of some bloody dead people (which is as gory as it gets) from that room and tells him about many many deaths associated with the room, but Mike thinks it's just a snow job and insists on staying.  By the way, Samuel Jackson adds just the right amount of creepyness to his part.<br /><br />So, Mike is led to his room and the manager departs his company at the elevator.  Things begin to happen very soon after Mike gets this attitude that nothing is going to happen.  First a window comes down and cracks open Mikes hand, and the clock mysteriously resets itself on a 60 minute countdown while it starts playing "We've Only Just Begun" by the Carpenters'.  A little at a time, all heck begins to break loose.  I can't tell you anymore without ruining the movie for you, but if you want a good scare, this should do it.  It's full of surprises and real heart-thumping terror.  When it's finally over you say, "Whew!" and are glad you're alive.<br /><br />No, I do NOT recommend it for children. Let them have their sweet childhood dreams as long as they can. By the way, I am pleased to say that I don't remember any foul language in the movie other than the comment by the hotel manager (above) for emphasis.  He was frustrated that he could not convince Mike to stay in another room, so the comment fit perfectly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Review of the Blu-ray Five Disc Package"></head><body><p>Much has been written and reviewed concerning the movie so I decided to limit my review to the new Blu-ray five disc release package. It is outstanding and completely satisfying on many levels. It includes the 3D and the 2D Blu-ray versions, a special features Blu-ray disc, a DVD version and a digital copy version. There's enough in this package to satisfy almost anyone who has an interest in the franchise.<br /><br />The 3D effects are rather modest but provide an interesting alternative for those who have taken the step into 3D. The picture and the sound are both first class; the movie features dts HD Master Audio 7.1 and the surround speakers are given a serious workout as is the subwoofer. There is an interesting surprise awaiting those who decided to watch all the way to the end of the credits; don't miss out on this one.<br /><br />Another very gratifying plus is the use of dts HD Master Audio 5.1 on the Bonus Disc; not only is the picture 1080P but it features an aggressive sound package which gives all of the speakers a good workout. The bonus features are interesting and well done; they're fun to watch.<br /><br />I have found this to be a lot of entertainment for the money; even at the somewhat higher price being charged I felt I got good value. When you divide the cost by five you find out it's a remarkable deal.</p></body></html>

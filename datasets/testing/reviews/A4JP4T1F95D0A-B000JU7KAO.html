I applaud Night for trying something differant from his usual formula twist ending.  But overall the movie didn't leave me feeling "wowed".  A lot of people around me booed when it was over.  I won't go that far, but the movie just doesn't get it done.  A lot of the movie feels like Night is taking shots at critics and studio executives in thinly veiled references.  This one can wait for dvd.</p></body></html>

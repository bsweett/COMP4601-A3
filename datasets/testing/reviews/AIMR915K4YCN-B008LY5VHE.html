I remember the absolute mania surrounding this Spielberg classic. People were suddenly terrified to swim in the ocean or even in lakes. You couldn't go anywhere without getting into a conversation about this movie. I saw it at the theater and was mesmerized. Here was Moby Dick for the modern age. A monster shark, intent on feasting on the inhabitants of tiny Amity island has begun snacking on swimmers. A local sherrif named Brody (Roy Scheider) slowly realizes that it's a much bigger problem than just a few random shark attacks. Enter Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) the marine expert, who first shows the seriousness of what they are dealing with. Meanwhile, the mayor has decided that there's nothing to worry about. He's more concerned with the thousands of tourists who will be arriving at the beaches for Labor Day weekend, and the money they will spend. Several deaths later, a local fisherman named Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to hunt down and kill the beast for a price. This brings Brody, Hooper, and Quint together for the greatest water adventure filmed to that point. It's man vs. Great white in a struggle for survival and supremacy. Not to mention the battle of wills between our three unlikely heroes. JAWS is a genuine masterpiece of suspense and horror. Please, steer clear of the godawful sequels, as they stinketh like so much chum...</p></body></html>

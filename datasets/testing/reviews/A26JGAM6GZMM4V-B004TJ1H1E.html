Although nominated for seven Academy Awards, it received only one (Orry-Kelly deservedly for Best Costume Design) which I think is ridiculous. This may well be Wilder's greatest achievement. It has lost nothing since first released in 1959. The basic situation is that two struggling musicians, Joe (Curtis) and Jerry (Lemon)  inadvertently witness gangland murders reminiscent of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and flee the bloody scene, fearing for their own lives. Desperate, they disguise themselves as women (Josephine and Daphne) and join Sweet Sue's All-Girl Orchestra. Joe/Josephine is immediately attracted to Sugar Kane, (Who wouldn't be?) The situation is  complicated by Osgood Fielding III's attraction to Jerry/Daphne. Fielding is played by Joe E. Brown to whom Wilder gives the best line as the film ends. Gender-reversals, cross-dressing, and all the confusions and double entendres they permit are brilliantly coordinated by Wilder as we follow the development of several different relationships.<p>Over the years, Wilder's impact on other directors is evident in films such Tootsie (directed by Sydney Pollack) and Mrs. Doubtfire (Chris Columbus), both of which are highly entertaining but neither of which has the depth and cohesion which Some Like It Hot does. Of course, there are several precedents such as various Shakespeare comedies and Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. In almost all of Wilder's films, there is an edge (sometimes a very sharp edge) with which he locates and reveals human imperfections with surgical skill. (The Apartment offers an excellent case in point as does.) My own take on this film is that whatever social satire it contains is subordinate to initiating and then sustaining what many would call a "romp" or "sex farce." Few other directors have Wilder's range. I find it almost incomprehensible that the same person who directed this film, Some Like It Hot, also directed Five Graves to Cairo (1943), The Lost Weekend (1945), and Sunset Boulevard (1950). <p>The DVD version obviously  offers clearer image and sound but also supplementary material which I also appreciate, notably the &quot;A Look Back&quot; documentary with Leonard Maltin and Tony Curtis as well as the Sweet Sues Featurette (The All-Girl Band) which provide a context within which to appreciate even more this uniquely entertaining film.</p></body></html>

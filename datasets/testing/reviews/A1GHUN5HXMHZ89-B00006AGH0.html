If for no other reason than to see Liev Shrieber in a part he excels in as an undercover agent cleaning up potentially national political and/or military messes. I would love to see him in more roles like this. Morgan is a great as usual and Affleck plays his part capably. The storyline change is a little ridiculous at this time since the idea of post war nazi fascist trying to make the US and Russia go to war is a bit cliche as some have pointed out. It really should have stayed with the more believable Middle East connection in the book. Still worth at least a rental.

They were surly. One spilled coffee on you, and that was the nice one: the other managed to ignore your call button all the way from the badlands over Nevada to Logan.<br /><br />And anyway, nowadays flying business is like renting a timeshare in Dante's 8th circle of Hell: fat men on the left of you flu victim on the right of you, into the jaws of death sat the 500!<br /><br />One rough cab ride through a tangle of dubious streets later, you're checked in to your sanctuary, your beachhead, your staging point & command center for the busy week ahead. You're wiped out. You want to get out of your oxfords, pad around in comfy clothes, pajamas maybe, fix yourself a little pot of that in-room coffee, brush your teeth, flop on the bed.<br /><br />You fumble with the magnetic key, the door makes a little hiss and opens inward---GASP!---your mind reels in shock, horror, agony!<br /><br />They said a double-king----this sad excuse for a bed looks like something out of summer camp!<br /><br />The room is the size of a broom closet! There's no mini-bar! There is zero shower pressure! And worse---the whole place reeks of stale cigarette smoke! They promised you a NON-SMOKING room!<br /><br />Man I'm telling you, when you're a business traveller, hotel rooms can really be a killer.But that's nothing compared to the Killer with wall-to-wall carpeting masquerading as an innocent little 40 x 40 square of Manhattan commercial real estate in the new Stevie King adaptation "1408".<br /><br />It's a killer. A legendary killer, an oubliette of murder & madness relegated to the Bad Old History of the Dolphin Hotel, responsible for 56 deaths over its busy little lifespan: murders, suicides, hangings, stabbings, the works.<br /><br />It is crouched, waiting in the stale, inky darkness, waiting for meat. It hasn't had a victim in years because the hotel keeps it locked up, recondite, no vacancy---ever. I imagine it's pretty hungry.<br /><br />All it needs is an occupant, and a little room to work its magic. Let's start with the idea, which is King's in one sense (the viciously haunted hotel-room), but universal in another: hotel rooms, consummately transient places, are singularly creepy.<br /><br />I remember many times sleepwalking among the blocky, startling objects standing their ground in unfamiliar quarters: muttering to myself, fumbling at my lock, bumping into strange arrangements of stale-smelling curtains and furniture. How many times do you think someone has gone a-roving in the deep nightland of dreams and snapped his neck because of the hotel room's unfamiliar topography?<br /><br />Second is the setup and build, which is masterfully, deliciously done here: Samuel L. Jackson spins his gruesome little tale in grim counterpoint to Cusack's masterfully apathetic fencing, and this well-appointed little duel nicely sets the mood and pulled me in for a brutal little night of ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged beasties. It's a nice, classic, atmospheric build---but it did something else I hadn't expected.<br /><br />It made me nervous.<br /><br />So to begin with, I'm keyed up. I'm tense.<br /><br />Director Mikael Hafstrom, working on first US film, gave me the crawls: the voices shrieking random nubmers and cryptic threats over the phone, that dull throb of despair, of nihilistic horror, the certainty that the universe is vast and endless and impersonal and cares not a whit about your fleeting, purposeless little life. That's evil.<br /><br />And for about 45 minutes, I have to give 1408 credit for giving me a good case of the crawls. Hafstrom creates, remarkably, a very visual sense of disorientation that works its way to a kind of paranoid vertigo. His malign Room plays all sorts of diabolic little tricks on Cusack at first, creating the sneaking suspicious that someone's in the room, in the vent, leading to a nasty little game of hide-and-seek---in which you really don't want to find out what's doing the Hiding.<br /><br />Even the nervous little battle of wills with a faulty A/C---when the repairman (champ vet actor Isiah Whitlock) refuses to cross the threshold and instead walks Cusack through the repair, I'm thinking "smart man."<br /><br />But in the end, it's all for naught. Like any hotel room, much of the charm wears off about halfway through your stay. Watching the insidious, nihilistic, world-hating evil thing holed up in Room 1408 drive John Cusack mad: intriguing, only because you're not sure exactly what the room will cook up. Seeing big cracks ripple up through the wall and blood pour out, or the room explode, or a big vast icy tundra appear---I've seen that before. About the time you see the jumping ghost (man, talk about a depressing spirit), the movie is headed to Dullsville.<br /><br />Take my advice: on this one, get an early wakeup call---and take plan on checking out early. Trust me: you'll thank me for it in the morning.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

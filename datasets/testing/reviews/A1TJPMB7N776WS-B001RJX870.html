<meta name="summary" content="Bunker Life"></head><body><p>Though it was made in Germany, "Downfall," the story of Hitler's last 15 days on Earth, it is pure Hollywood both in execution and tone....more television special mini-series than serious work of art.<br />With that said, the central story of Hitler's last days in the bunker with Himmler, Eva Braun, Goebbels, Eva Braun and his secretary, Traudl Junge (the real Junge appeared in her own documentary, "Blind Spot" her recollection of her time with Hitler and Eva in the Bunker) and assorted others is so fascinating that it is impossible to avert your eyes from the screen.<br />Director Oliver Hirschbiegel  and his production designer fill the screen with eye-popping, though not particularly sophisticated detail: the dark, claustrophobic bunker with Hitler (a dynamic Bruno Ganz) slowly losing control of his kingdom while his army and ss officers celebrate with the best French champagne and Russian caviar that recalls Nero fiddling while Rome burned.<br />Ganz appropriately chews the scenery with his crazy, ranting portrayal of Hitler on the one hand: been there, seen that. But Hirschbiegel shows a more human, tender Hitler: his warm relationship with Eva, who he marries while in the bunker (the person officiating at the wedding asks Hitler is he is 100% Aryan...a part of the official 3rd Reich wedding ceremony...funny) before he shoots and poisons her as well as his special relationship with his German shepherd, Blondi whom he also poisons. Does this do much to humanize Hitler, arguably the most hated man of the 20th Century? Not really but it does add positive texture to a life that most of us know so very little about. "Downfall" merely and I think naively points out that we are all capable of Evil.<br />Bruno Ganz excels when he digs beneath the surface and adds the little touches that humanize Hitler. He punctuates his performance with small details: the pushing back behind his ear of his unruly, straight, pomaded hair, the twitching of his left hand, which he holds behind him so as not to appear weak or sick in front of his officers and Ganz's use of his huge, bloodhound-like eyes to reflect and divert what is going on in his incredible, insane mind.<br />"Downfall" is an interesting, diverting film: at times silly and melodramatic; at others...fascinating and enthralling. Ganz's performance makes it a must see.</p></body></html>

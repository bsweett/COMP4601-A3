For example, in the scenes where people were fleeing the city. Everybody was puzzled and did not know what's happening. I could see the anxiety and puzzlement on their faces. In another scene, it shocked me when the kid was shot in the face after he banged on the door of the house.<br /><br />The thing that let me down the most was the love between Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. There's some chemistry between them but it's not portrayed strong enough. If it had been, it would have made the movie more touching and lovely.<br /><br />Overall, it's more like a drama than a thriller. It's still worth watching once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Didn't I See This On "The X-Files?""></head><body><p>Scary, chilling, and a not so suprise twist ending best describe this thriller that feels like an expanded "X-Files" episode.  The cast is superb.  The special effects are effective.  Not a real gory tale, but plenty of action and thrills.  Great direction  and spooky score also are a plus.  The story is pure and simple:  People seem to be disappearing all over the city.  Along with the person the memories also are missing, except for one mother.  She remembers her son, but no one else does.  Is she crazy?  Has she gone completely insane, no!  I won't give away what happens to them (for that is the twist) but think "X-Files."  I miss Mulder and Scully.</p></body></html>

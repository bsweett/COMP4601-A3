But Eastwood is after more here than the heroic anonymity that that character afforded him.  No, his "last" Western (and I dare say this film proves that the genre is too flexible to be dead) deals with the nihilism of the old West, and the grey area between good and evil that the "new" kind of outlaw must deal with.  And how that outlaw is no longer a perfect, indestructible beast, but a man with tough choices to make.  Eastwood did a wonderful job putting all these issues up on screen.<p>Eastwood is a very interesting actor.  He really isn't technically proficient, and if he's given too much dialogue, he's liable to trample all over the reality of the moment.  But give him a chance to stare at you with those steely eyes, or answer a threat from an enemy with a simple "Yeah", and he'll knock you out of your boots.  He gives himself ample opportunities to work to those strengths here.<p>Gene Hackman, on the other hand, can put the fear of God in you with a twinkle of his eye.  I don't think this man has it in him to deliver a bad performance.  And here he gets to play the Gene Hackman role that defines all Gene Hackman roles.  His Little Bill is authoritative, fearless, feared, and especially charismatic.  Also good here are Morgan Freeman, although a tad underused in what amounts to a sidekick role, and Richard Harris as an English gunfighter whose legend may be purely mythical.  Unimpressive in the face of these acting giants is Jaimz Woolvett as the Schofield Kid.  I suppose his youthful bluster is expected, he being the new generation and all.  But his delivery felt a little too over-the-top, especially in a movie striving for realism. <p>I hesitate in praising this movie too much, for it didn't stick to its guns, so to speak.  I'm speaking of the ending, and I promise here not to reveal any spoilers.  Let's just say that if the object was to turn the Western on its head, then I don't believe that they chose the appropriate way to tie up the narrative.  That being said, what we have here is a highly suspenseful and rousing Western, albeit one where the good guys and the bad guys aren't so clearly delineated.</p></body></html>

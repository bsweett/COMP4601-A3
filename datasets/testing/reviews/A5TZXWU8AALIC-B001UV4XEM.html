<meta name="summary" content="I Have to Admit...This was Funny"></head><body><p>The one thing that jumped out at me...where this movie differs from most alleged "comedies" these days...was the script.  It doesn't follow a basic storyline.  It jumps around.  And it's not hard to follow for doing that.  It presents a mystery with the mayhem: What did we do last night?<br /><br />The film opens with a group of buds heading to a bachelor party in Las Vegas.  Nothing too unusual.  Tom Hanks did this 20-some years ago in BACHELOR PARTY.<br /><br />Then the film jumps ahead to the morning after.  The buds wake up.  And nothing makes sense.  The groom is missing.  There's a tiger in the bathroom.  The luxurious (and expensive) suite is trashed.  There's a naked Asian guy in the trunk of their car.  And they don't remember a thing.<br /><br />So the buds are left to solve a mystery: what happened?<br /><br />This is rude, crude and raunchy stuff, and I laughed more than I have at most of the dismal comedies I have endured recently.<br /><br />(Make sure you stick around for the photographs shown during the end credits!)</p></body></html>

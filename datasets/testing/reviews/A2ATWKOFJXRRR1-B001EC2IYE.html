<meta name="summary" content="A Fatalistic View at the End of the Rainbow"></head><body><p>Maggie Fitzgerald (played excellently by Hillary Swank) is trying to scratch her way out from under her trailer-trash past. She's working as a waitress at a dive diner, and in her spare-time she works the amateur circuit in the little advertised sport of female boxing. But what she really needs is a coach, a trainer.<br /><br />Enter Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a washed-up boxing coach who owns a cheesy little mid-town training facility. He's in league with one of his old boxing pals, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). They quietly run the place. Maybe too quietly.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's character keeps sending warning messages to Clint about "holding back" potential contenders for world championship positions. And when one of Clint's formidable fighters leaves him for another trainer, and wins a title, Clint's character is forced to examine his dealings in greater detail. Not an easy thing to do for a man who has incredible guilt resting on his ample shoulders.<br /><br />It is clear from the outset that Clint's charcter blames himself for Eddie's blind right eye (he was unable to throw in the towel during the fatal fight that caused Eddie's blindness). He also has an estranged daughter who keeps sending back his letters "return to sender" every time he mails her anything (Clint has a box full of the returned envelopes in his closet). Add to this that he goes to mass every day at his local church (partly out of guilt and partly to harrass the clergy) and you've got a pretty deep character on the screen.<br /><br />Maggie enters Clint and Morgan's lives despite the fact that they "don't train girlees", and sets up camp in their boxing establishment. Finally, Clint gives in and starts to train her. Their interactions are excellent together as Clint takes Swank through the basics of the sport, teaching her foot movements, weight shifting, speed bag usage, and other crucial items.<br /><br />The greatness and horribleness of boxing are brought into blinding focus here. It's a dangerous sport, with dreams that can quickly turn into nightmares.<br /><br />The ending of the film is a fatalist's dream. The movie tries to downplay this by saying that "sometimes, you just don't have anything left". But it didn't work for me on that level (thus my four star rating). But the superlative acting kept my interest. All of the actors, from Swanks excellent portrayal of the desperate human, to Clint's amazing scene with the clergy in the church after a horrible accident, to Morgan Freeman's gritty voice-overs and stunning visual presence, this movie will undoubtedly be an Oscar contender for many of the actors. But will it win a Best Picture Award? I don't think so. But that's just my opinion.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another great film from Pixar"></head><body><p>I have always been meaning to see "The Incredibles" when it first came out in the theatres but alas I never had the opportunity to do so. I finally got around to renting the movie. I have to say I absolutely loved the film.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" revolves around Bob and Helen Parr who back in the day were known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. Because of lawsuits, Mr.Incredible and Elastigirl are forced into retirement. They have three children Violet, Dash, and Jack. They live in a quaint suburban home. Over the years, Bob (or Mr. Incredible)becomes very restless and one night goes out to relieve his glory days as a superhero with his friend Frozone. What Bob doesn't know he is being watched by a mysterious stranger named Mirage who eventually recruits him to perform a secret mission (which leads to a series of secret missions).<br /><br />I have to admit I was a bit wary of this film. I thought Pixar couldn't outdo "Finding Nemo" (one of my top five favorite Pixar films) but the company did with "The Incredibles". The writing was excellent. I especially liked how they captured the teen angst that Violet was going through. What girl didn't go through that insecure stage that Violet experienced in the film? The animation was nothing short of amazing. Pixar continues to impress me with their use of computer graphics with every film they churn out.<br /><br />As far as animated films goes, Pixar has managed to outclass their rival Dreamworks with the excellent storywriting and impressive use of CGI. You truly do not need to be a child to enjoy films like "The Incredibles". Kudos for Brad Bird for making a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.</p></body></html>

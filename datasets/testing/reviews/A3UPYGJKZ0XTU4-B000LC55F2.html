<meta name="summary" content="Effective, Atmospheric Thriller that Keeps Its Tricks Up Its Sleeve."></head><body><p>"The Prestige" is a psychological thriller set circa 1900 in the world of master magicians who compete to create the most astonishing illusions using the latest technologies that will amaze and captivate audiences. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is a masterful showman who has left a privileged upbringing behind to pursue a career in magic. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a brilliant, daring magician from humble beginnings who will sacrifice anything to be truly great at his craft. An on-stage tragedy when the two men were young apprentice magicians sets in motion a bitter, obsessive rivalry that turns violent. When Angier's ingenieur Mr. Cutter (Michael Caine), who designs and constructs his magic tricks, is confounded by Borden's great "Transported Man" trick, Angier sends his assistant and mistress Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to infiltrate Borden's operation and learn his secrets.<br /><br />"The Prestige" was adapted from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel of the same name. Some obvious flaws in logic and a plot and structure that are perhaps overcomplicated prevent me from giving this film 5 stars. A persistent and pivotal question over which knot was tied doesn't make sense, for example, because the characters could easily see the knot. The great illusion that brings the story to its startling conclusion also defies logic.  But "The Prestige" is a very effective -and very atmospheric- thriller. Christian Bale's performance is especially intriguing. The depth of Borden and Angier's obsession with their secrets and with each other is compelling. Scientist Nicola Tesla (David Bowie), creator of alternating current, has a small role in this intricate plot. And although I think that Tesla is one of several extraneous elements that might have been better left out, I am glad to see his genius get a little publicity.<br /><br />Curiously, two 2006 films were set in the culture of turn of the century conjurers: "The Prestige" and "The Illusionist". The two films are about entirely different things, but both are clever, effective thrillers that internalize the concept of illusion, assiduously misdirecting the audience until the right moment arrives to reveal themselves. Though imperfect, these two magic movies are among the most entertaining and provocative in my recent memory. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. See them both. They're not redundant. "The Prestige" is a gripping psychological thriller. "The Illusionist" is historically inspired and visually and aurally entrancing. One pits science against the magic arts, while the other places science within them.<br /><br />The DVD (Buena Vista 2007): "The Director's Notebook" is a 5-part featurette that includes interviews with director Christopher Nolan, the cast, novelist Christopher Priest, and screenwriter Jonathan Nolan about Victorian era magicians, the film's visual style, themes, and Nicola Tesla. "The Art of The Prestige" includes publicity stills, photos of costumes and sets, behind-the-scenes stills, and 9 examples of poster art that appeared in the movie. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.</p></body></html>

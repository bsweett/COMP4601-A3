You know....<br /><br />Well the "visiting plumber" is of course Sly Stallone who tries some tear jerking "I don't do violence anymore" rubbish before indulging in the most ridiculously violent gore fest I have ever seen. I swear it is the living personification of Itchy and Scratchy but without the tightly woven plot and good acting. If your idea of a good time is colouring in pictures of guns with wax crayons because they wont let you have anything sharper, and you aint interested in books that have words in them, ("Well, lookey here, we got us a reader") you will love this!<br /><br />Oh, and the sniper used to be in "Coronation Street", the well-known British soap.<br />"EEh love, Jack Duckworths pigeons need cleaning out again, can you give us a hand?"<br />"Nah love, I'm going up the jungle with Sly Stallone to do some shooting."<br /><br />I bet he never saw that coming!</p></body></html>

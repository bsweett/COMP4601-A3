And the cinematography was gorgeous: The yellow of the VW Bus mingled with the bright-blue sky was beautiful. And there were several genuinely funny moments: the sickly honk of the broken VW horn had me all a-giggle:) And I would not dream of quibbling with the dark-notes (Grandfather is a heroin addict, the father is a failed motivational speaker, uncle is a suicidal primadona, and the son is a psuedo-intellectual adolescent who refuses to speak and pretends to read Nietzsche). That's fine.<br /><br />I have a feeling that the "disappointed" reviews that you find here are a result of the manner in which the film was promoted: as a "comedy." I think that label is fairly deceptive. I would say that this film defies genre (which is always the hallmark of a truly innovative film). For instance, I think Boyle's Trainspotting and Kelly's Donnie Darko are hysterical masterpieces, but I surely wouldn't call them comedies. Similarly, I would be hard-pressed to label this "road-trip" film a "comedy."<br /><br />The work is well-worth the watch JUST TO SEE THE DANCE COMPETITION (no spoilers, but it is the best part of the film!) Just do not go into the piece expecting a laugh-riot . . . it is pretty subtle but thoughtful.<br /><br />The film team admits to having great difficulty in finding a suitable conclusion to the work. While this contributes to your anxiety as a viewer, you should be aware that there are other endings included. Watch these alternate endings . . . one is superior to the actual conclusion . . . but I'll let you decide which:)<br /><br />A good film, it just doesn't live up to the hype that the media and the masses constructed.</p></body></html>

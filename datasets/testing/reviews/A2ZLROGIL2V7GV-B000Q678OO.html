<meta name="summary" content=""I was cured all right!"  One of the Greatest Films"></head><body><p>"A Clockwork Orange" is a haunting and disturbing look into the future.  This is a classic that just goes to show you how great films can be.  There is no equal to this movie.  This is a movie that must be seen by all movie lovers.<p>Alex is a troubled youth, who plays hookey and hangs around with his friends, (or "droogs, as he calls them).  They are the most reckless, violent, offensive, and careless sort who feels no sympathy for anyone or anything.  Well, all of that changes one night when Alex is caught up in an accidental murder and is sent to prison.  He is then found eligible for a rehabilitation program, which proves to take its toll on the young hoodlum.  This is a dark and briliant film, which also proves to be a bit of a satire about governments and rehab programs.<p>I loved this movie.  It was directed by Stanley Kubrick, who never missed a beat when it came to directing haunting and disturbing films that enhances the brain.  The images are disturbing and beautiful at the same time.  Malcom McDowell is a fine actor in this movie, spewing out dialogue that sounds like poetry.<p>I know this DVD set is tough to find, but if you can, it's worth it.  Though, there are no different special features, the picture is remastered and the second disk is the soundtrack.<p>Most memorable scene in the movie:  When Alex and the gang are beating up a couple in their home.  As he is kicking and stomping the man, he is singing "Singin' in the Rain."  What once was something so innocent and sweet is transformed into something so hideous and violent.  I loved it!<p>This is what film making is all about.  I plan to read the book as soon as I can.  "A Clockwork Orange," is, and will forever be, a true classic.  This movie is flawless, or at least I think so.  If you are a movie lover of true classics, see this movie as soon as you can.  If you've already seen it, SEE IT AGAIN!  It's nice to know that there are still quality films out there that actually feed the mind.  Beautiful and perfect in every way.<p>P.S.  We will forever miss you, Stanley Kubrick.  Your genius is missed by all.</p></body></html>

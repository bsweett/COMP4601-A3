<meta name="summary" content="Alien vs Predator Delivers on Modest Scale"></head><body><p>Acceptable blend of franchises. ALIEN vs PREDATOR delivers purely on popcorn action and comic book sensibilities to please hardcore fans. However, what we need is memorable characters and the humans are generic and not memorable as they are lost in the backgrounds and special effects (which are pretty well done). Also, one would think that the combining of these two modern cinema behemoths would be of epic proportions.  The movie is slightly over 90 minutes with only a few of each of the creatures running around. The movie plays more like a SCI-FI CHANNEL original movie than a major motion picture release (and will end up on that cable channel anyway). What the producers should have done to make this worthwhile, and hopefully someone will read and think of this review when the sequel of A vs P is in pre-production. That is to have the two franchises merge with another franchise...JURASSIC PARK!! Wouldn't it be great to see a Raptor and/or T-Rex fight an ALIEN and/or a PREDATOR. Now, that would be something!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good Sci-Fi movie"></head><body><p>My family saw this movie at the theater and we just watched the DVD.  We enjoyed it both times.  My wife loves movies with child actors in it and said that this reminded her of "Stand by Me."  I thought the kids did a good job of acting and the story line was pretty good.  The special effects were also good and Spielberg always makes a great movie.<br /><br />It was creative and interesting to watch but I did not give it 5 starts because the alien wasn't really seen until the end and only for a short period of time.  In the old movies they did this and kept the screen dark because the special effects were so bad. I always hated that! Today that is not necessary as special effects look so real and I think the movie would have been better with more scenes with the alien being shown.<br /><br />Overall it is a solid rank of 4 but it could have been a 5 with some script changes and more alien sightings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Forest deserved 2 academy awards for his performance."></head><body><p>Edy Amin was so unstable and childish, but he was very charming when he wanted to be or wanted something. He also wielded a lot of power, his army was loyal and would do his bidding.  He was a complex leader who's intense paranoia lead to his eventual downfall. Forest nailed the part.  Excellent movie, don't miss it.</p></body></html>

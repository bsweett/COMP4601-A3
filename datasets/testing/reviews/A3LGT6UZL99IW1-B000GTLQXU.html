Er, guys, yes it is.  And a poor one at that.  The ship is like the original Terminator - every time you defeat the guy, he comes back with even more.  Unlike the Terminator, this is not entertaining - it's painful to watch.  There's so much that just does not make sense.<br /><br />1) What keeps blowing up?!?  Man, if cruise ships are *that* explosive, I'm never setting foot on one again. It's like a '70 car chase - or a Monty Python skit - where everything explodes. Radar towers, swimming pools - you name it.  It done blowed up.<br /><br />2) The bow thrusters, a critical part at the end.  They don't work like that. They could NOT work like that.<br /><br />3) The fire and water lobby scene.  How about just WALKING around?  The balconies clearly encircle the lobby.  Why dive into the fire covered water?  Same scene, the hose slide, two people, supported by a piece of brass, held on to by a couple of sweaty hands?  PLEASE!<br /><br />4) The designers never heard of GFCI's, Coast Guard regs, or standard shipbuilding practices dealing with electrical systems. This ship would never get a certification to carry passengers!<br /><br />There is just so much that's wrong with this film that it's beyond imagination.  Every scene - literally - anyone with an IQ over 80 will be thinking "What the?!?! Why do that?!? How in the hell could that happen?!? Give me a break!!!"  The director can't even decide how BIG the wave actually is.<br /><br />Promotions and CD covers show it towering over the ship.  When the captain sees it, the algle of the binocs and the proportional size would make it over 200 feet tall.  Look at our Gay Architect when he's about to jump and spots the wave. His eyes are looking at almost a 45 degree angle - and the wave is still a LONG way out.</p></body></html>

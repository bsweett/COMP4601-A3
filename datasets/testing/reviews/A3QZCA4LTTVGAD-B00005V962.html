<meta name="summary" content="Rat Pack: The Next Generation"></head><body><p>&quot;Ocean's 11,&quot; directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a remake of a 1960 film of the same name. That first film co-starred the notorious &quot;Rat Pack,&quot; which included Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. Soderbergh's version stars George Clooney as Danny Ocean, an ex-convict who organizes a team of 11 criminals for an audacious plot: to rob the vault of Las Vegas casinos owned by super-rich Terry Benedict (played with a nice edge by Andy Garcia).<p>&quot;O11&quot; is a very entertaining film: an effective mix of humor, character drama, inventive plot twists, and high-tech thrills. The superb ensemble cast includes Julia Roberts (as Clooney's love interest), Matt Damon (as a pickpocket), and Brad Pitt (as a master card player). The ensemble members have great chemistry together. Clooney follows up terrific roles in &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; with his role as Ocean. Clooney is charming and likeable, and his expressive eyes bring a nice wistful touch to his performance.<p>The film is also greatly enlivened by the versatile Don Cheadle as a British demolitions expert. Elliot Gould is hilarious as a rival to Garcia's character: watch out for his outrageous costumes. But my favorite performance in the film belongs to show biz legend Carl Reiner as an aging con man; he is outstanding, and quite endearing, in his double-layered role.<p>Some aspects of the plot are a bit far-fetched, and I must admit to a degree of unease with a film that essentially glorifies destructive criminal behavior. But the film's strong points are evident. I particularly like how the film evokes the excitement, glamour, and intrigue of the high-stakes Las Vegas scene. &quot;Ocean's 11&quot; is another strong effort from one of our most interesting directors.</p></body></html>

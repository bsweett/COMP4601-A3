<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Movie!"></head><body><p>An enormously entertaining movie from the master of cinema Stephen Spielberg. This has got to be the 4th best movie of 2002! Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the while he's pursued by a dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty ), whose dogged determination stays one step behind Abagnale's spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn in enjoyable performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it zipping along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please his father. In my oppinion, this is a must see for anyone that has good taste. ...if I were you I'd get out there and see this movie as soon as possible.</p></body></html>

With an eye for intelligent detail, and a feeling for the darker side of life, Mann serves up a terrific and stylish cinematic experience that is, at once, thought provoking, and suspenseful, while also quite disturbing. The film centers on one night where a cabdriver and a hit man meet and end up spreading murder and mayhem throughout the city. From the glass and glitter of the Downtown skyscrapers, to the industrialized warehouses of Pico Union, from the streets of West Hollywood, to the expanse of Los Angeles International Airport, Michael Mann uses all the resources of Los Angeles to show a side of the City that is constantly bathed in dark, somber and forbidding shades. Collateral is pure twenty first century film noir.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a cold, calculating hit man who's really good at killing people and Jamie Foxx plays a cabdriver that long ago put his dreams of owning his own limousine company on the back burner. As the sun sets over the Los Angeles skyline, Foxx indulges in a friendly conversation with a very attractive attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith). After he drops her Downtown, Max's night takes a turn for the worst when he picks up the silver-haired Vincent who immediately takes him hostage. Vincent has five people to kill before the night is over, and Max is going to drive him to each destination whether he likes it or not. While both the FBI and the LAPD (led by a the smart, perceptive Mark Ruffalo) are hot on their tail, Max and Vincent's encounter soon develops into a type of unsettled relationship; a kind of shared camaraderie based on mutual need. With Cruise and Foxx are trapped in the cab together throughout much of the story, the film focuses on their disparate chemistry and the psychological warfare that steadily builds between them.<br /><br />Cruise plays the calculating, cold-blooded killer with a powerful restraint. This is an intense, strong performance that is probably a career best for him. His haggard, tired face, his sweep of silvery hair and his five-day beard growth show a man where the years of indiscriminate killing have gradually taken their toll. But Foxx steals the show - he represents the moral heart of Collateral and his portrait of an affable, sensitive, but ultimately disappointed and embittered cab driver, is almost certainly Oscar worthy. The supporting cast is terrific: Mark Ruffalo, looking almost Latino, gives an impressive, and totally realistic performance as the undercover cop who's called to the scene of Cruise's first hit, Jada Pinkett Smith makes the most of a brief, but crucial role as Foxx's first customer of the night, and Javier Bardem is also effective in a short scene as a seedy, sleazy Latino nightclub owner.<br /><br />Collateral ultimately succeeds as a beautifully shot, well-acted and thoroughly engrossing psychological drama. The mood and suspense are steadily built, the pacing is tight, and there is one mesmerizing and horribly violent scene involving a shootout in a Korean nightclub that will probably leave viewers gasping. This is an expertly crafted, dynamic film that is full of surprising plot twists and turns. Collateral is everything that we have come to expect from such a talented filmmaker as Michael Mann.

<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie about a man who is true to his word"></head><body><p>This could have easily been the movie of the year.  Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a down on his luck Medical Equipment Salesman who decides to push back when his life gets rough.  He pursues through very tough times, and manages to keep his son happy, and finally is able to find real happiness with the success of his word, his morals, and excellent work ethic.  An inspirational story for all.  The characters in this film are all believable, and it is great to think that this is based on a true story.  Weather you have read the book or not, this film is worth renting or buying.  You won't be dissapointed.</p></body></html>

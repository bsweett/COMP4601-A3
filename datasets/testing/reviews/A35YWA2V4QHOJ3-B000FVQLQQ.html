<meta name="summary" content="A biography of a tormented intellectual"></head><body><p>For those of us who have read the novel by Sylvia Nasar, this movie will come as a complete surprise.  I remember sitting in the theatre in complete confusion thru portions of the film.  The confusion, however, was finally replaced by the realization of what the makers of this movie were trying to do.<p>The 3 imagined characters were pure fiction and much of the movie was highly fabricated.  The film also entirely omitted the object of Nash's first affair, Eleanor, as well as the son he fathered by her, John David.  <p>As all good movies do, this film had its reasons for proceeding thus.  The story is about Nash's courtship and marriage of Alicia.  It was during this period in his life that he experienced his biggest bouts with mental illness, which is also central to the theme.  To have included Eleanor and John David would have made the movie much longer and the film would have lost its focus.<p>As for Nash's illness itself, to give an accurate account would have made the film wander about without any real direction (which is exactly what Nash himself DID do for several years).  The 3 fictional characters are installed to bring the film a cohesive plot as well as a storyline with a considerable degree of symmetry.<p>Ron Howard does an outstanding job directing this film.  The cast, featuring Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Jennifer Connoley, is magnificent.  Particularly impressive is Crowe as this role is so very different from his notable performance in GLADIATOR.<p>This is a film that I would recommend everyone adding to their DVD collection.  Movies about the lives of atheletes are commonplace, but films that detail the stories of intellectuals are exceedingly scarce.  For that reason alone, I would admonish all persons to watch this movie.<p>Ultimately, this movie is a REPRESENTATION of Nash's life as opposed to a glossing over of actual events.  However, in Hollywood, as well as storytelling in general, style is something that may trump veracity.  For those who want the full story I recommend Nasar's book by the same name.</p></body></html>

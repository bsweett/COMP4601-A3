<meta name="summary" content="Romero delivers, again"></head><body><p>Ah, it's finally come. I should open saying that I, like many of you, am a ravening Romero fanboy, and this was probably the second most anticipated film release yet to occur in my life. (And arguably, it should be number one. The actual #1 is 'Kill Bill, Vol. 2', which is, naturally, something of a cheat as it is the second half of single film, which is gonna severely increase the desire to view it.) But, though my anticipation was great, my expectations weren't actually all that high. For one thing, I'm sufficiently cynical that whenever I get really excited about something, I get really worried that it's not gonna be very good. Also, I'd read the script online, and although it clearly had the potential to be a very good movie, it certainly wasn't anything particularly remarkable or revelatory. Mind you, I certainly didn't think it was gonna be bad, but I was expecting something earth-shattering either. And, it wasn't earth-shattering, but it was excellent, and surpassed my expectations. It does little to stir the human soul, I suppose, but it offers plenty of gruesome action along with the best looking zombies ever and a script that is a cut above what you'd usually see in this sorta film. All in all, I'd say 'Land of the Dead' is about as good as you could reasonably hope.<br /><br />One of the most impressive things about the original 'Dead' trilogy is how different the three films are. 'Land of the Dead' continues this trend, and it very unlike the 3 prior films, and is really about as original as one could reasonably expect a new film to be, while still remaining within the traditional zombie movie format. (Some professional reviewers disagree with me, but they don't spend nearly as much time watching zombie movies as I do, or you do, most likely.) This is the first genuinely post-apoclyptic zombie movie I've come across, in the sense that it is a zombie infested world in which a new human society has developed. This may not be the most remarkable twist in the world, but, again, it's about as big a one as your likely to have while remaining within the confines of the genre.<br /><br />The plot centers around the crew of Dead Reckoning, a custom-built battle vehicle used to scavenge supplies from the zombie filled world. Riley is in command of the vehicle, an antisocial type who simply wishes to flee from both humans and zombies, and live in the frozen north. Cholo is second in command. He's something of a firebrand, compared to the controlled Riley, and he wants to buy his way into the Fiddler's Green, a high-class, privileged tower amidst the ruins of Pittsburgh. Kaufman, owner of Fiddler's Green, however, isn't interested in money alone, and wishes to keep lowly sorts like Cholo out of the Green. Enraged by his rejection, Cholo steals Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy the Green if he doesn't pay a large ransom. Not wanting to pay up, Kaufman hires Riley to stop Cholo, and bring the vehicle back. Riley has no love for Kaufman, but if Cholo goes through with his plan, a lot of innocents will be killed, and Riley sees this as his opportunity to flee the city. Meanwhile, one zombie called Big Daddy, enraged by the wanton slaughter of his fellow zombies in a recent raid, notices the grand tower at the center of the city, and heads of towards the living community, leading a pack of zombies, who are apparently rather inspired by his atypical drive and direction.<br /><br />Though this film is moderately budgeted by mainstream standards(somewhere between 15 and 20 million), LotD has by far the highest production values of any Romero film. Despite the limited budget, Romero creates a full, convincing post-apocalyptic world, with a nice battle truck. (A truck which easily could've been very lame) Also, the zombie effects are the best you've ever seen, with easily the most varied and detailed faces around. Since this takes place years after the apocalypse, the zombies are in various states of decay, some fresh and mangled, some ancient and emaciated. Most impressive is one of the lead zombies, #9, who has her cheek ripped open, exposing her back teeth. It's a clever effect, and extremely realistic. Though many idiots whined about how the film was gonna be rated R, apparently unaware how much more lax the MPAA is compared to 20 years ago, this film more than delivers in terms of graphic violence. In terms of sheer volume, LotD is comparable to `Day', and it easily has the most flesh-eating of any of the Dead films. The gore is approached in a different way, as we don't watch a single character be mutilated to the extent they were in the prior two, but the sheer volume of effects is extraordinary. The natural effects are great, though the bites aren't quite as cool as they were in `Day'. There is some CGI, which is too bad, but it's pretty much unavoidable. As Nicotero mentioned in an interview, you can't just stick a squib on an actor's head anymore, and it would be totally impractical to put a squib on a stuntman every time someone had to get shot. The CGI is generally excellent, though it falters in one scene where a zombie's head is scissored off.<br /><br />As the synopsis would suggest, this film falls into the action-horror category, rather than just pure horror. It doesn't completely abandon horror for action, however, like so many recent zombie movies have. Unfortunately, Romero relies to heavily on jump scenes, as zombies constantly leap from around corners or where ever. This is probably my biggest beef with the film. Fortunately, the jump-scenes usually aren't all there is to it: Once the zombies appear, they have to deal with them the way they typically did in the earlier films. Romero shoots the action and horror scenes old-school: keeps the damn camera still, lets you see what's going on etc. Mind you, I really like flashy camerawork, but this new school of camerawork ain't flashy, just incoherent and stupid.<br /><br />Much has been made of how some of the zombies are smarter now, but this isn't really that important to the film. All that really matters is that one of the zombies becomes smart enough to actually actively attack the humans, rather than just wandering around, and the other zombies follow him. Yeah, the zombies pick up and use tools sometimes, but they did that in earlier Dead films as well, and their use of guns is utterly minimal. For the most part, these zombies behave precisely like your traditional Romero zombies. Well, towards the end it suggests that some zombies have  become intelligent enough that they're beyond eating people.  This is a little strange, but there are still plenty of mean, stupid zombies to go around.<br /><br />While reading the script, it looked as if the characters would be a bit to cliched, but this proved not to be the case. Cholo looked like he might be too wild and uncontrolled, but Leguizamo holds back a bit with him, and makes him more real and naturalistic than he might have been. Similarly, Riley is basically your typical jaded soldier type, but Baker plays him more like a normal guy than an action hero. Hopper is typically known for being wildly over the top, but he plays Kaufman very low-key, as he should. Overall, the acting is very solid, though not much is typically asked of them. Special note should also go to Robert Joy as Riley's sidekick Charlie, a dimwitted sharpshooter. He's kinda used for comic relief, but he's endearing rather than obnoxious, unlike most sidekicks. These characters generally aren't terribly deep or complex, but they usually seem surprisingly real, like they did in Romero's earlier Dead films. (And unlike they usually do in this sorta film, where they often just go to the movie store, and buy a crate of `Generic, Clich&eacute; Characters, 10 Count'. I'm looking at you, `Dawn of the Dead 2004'.) Unfortunately, Romero makes a few attempts at quips and catch phrases, most of which are quite lame. But, this sorta thing comes with the territory, and it isn't a big deal.  When I read the script, much of the dialogue was kinda hokey, but it plays better when you  actually see it.<br /><br />Well, I guess that's it. This is just a very finely crafted zombie film, which finds a distinct niche in a very crowded subgenre. A fine return to the genre.<br /><br />Update for DVD: The DVD itself looks very nice. (I really don't have that much of an eye for this sorta thing, however, so if others see some flaws they may be right.) As anticipated, the new cut isn't much different.  There's one new scene, about 3 minutes long, involving Cholo dealing with a suicide in an apartment.  It's a reasonably effective scene, and one of the more horror oriented sequences, but it hasn't really got anything to do with anything else in the film, however. (Which is why it was cut in the first place.)  It's got a bit more gore, with many shots extended slightly, and a few new things. (Such as one person getting their eye bit off, and Mouse getting ripped apart and disemboweled etc.)  Some people have been acting as if this version is way gorier, which is isn't, but it's got some notable additions, and further cements this film's position as having the best combination of quantity, quality and variety, when it comes to gore.  (Other than 'Day of the Dead', probably.  It's a tough call.)  I listened to the commentary, and it was acceptable, but not fascinating, and not nearly as interesting as Romero's ones generally are.  But, oh well, it's a fine DVD.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

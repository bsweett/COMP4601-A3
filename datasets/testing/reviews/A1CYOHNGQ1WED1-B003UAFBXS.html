Elvis, JFK, a mummy; I don't know how you make a boring movie out of that, but they managed.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell plays Elvis as an old man trapped in a nursing home where they think he's just an Elvis impersonator. Ossie Davis plays another resident who believes he is JFK. Elvis and JFK team up to defeat an Egyptian mummy that comes at night to steal the souls of the nursing home patients. I'll give it a star for originality and another because I like Bruce Campbell. You'll never get a crazier plot but they don't do anything with it. The budget must have been non-existent because the makeup is awful, the effects, if you can call them that, are Mystery Science Theater level.<br /><br />It's just one boring scene after another that finally, mercifully, leads to the conclusion that's anticlimactic, poorly staged and ultimately meaningless. There are a few funny lines and moments but not enough. Most of their attempts to be funny were just crude, about the same as an 11 year old boy. A big missed opportunity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A 21st century queen"></head><body><p>Marie Antoinette is one of those historical figures who will always excite our curiousity--from our very modern perspective we wonder, perhaps, how could someone be so blind to the world around them, how bad could it really be to live in the center of a court dedicated to pleasure? Very bad indeed--and Coppola convinces us of it, which is an accomplishment. Marie is the youngest daughter of the powerful Austrian Empress, sent off at the age of 15 to France. She's a pretty unspoiled child, who is stripped of everything she knows--her maids, her dog, her clothes--and turned into a gorgeously dressed doll to be presented to the rapacious court as the next queen of France. Dunst does a lovely job, by turns frivolous, reckless, sympathetic and loving. She and Louis XVI are really just a pair of clueles teenagers, deliberately shut off from the world by a court filled with schemers. To Dunst's credit, she portrays Marie as a child who manages to mature into a loving mother and caring wife.<br /><br />At first I too was puzzled by the music, the dialogue, the dreamy progress from scene to scene. But would English with a French accent be any more authentic than English with an American or British accent? I don't think so. Once you get past that, the film is a visual feast, and Coppola won an Oscar for costume design. Many complain that the movie ends when the royal couple leave Versailles, but we know what happens next, don't we? Coppola's film is a dream--we know the nightmare it becomes all too well.</p></body></html>

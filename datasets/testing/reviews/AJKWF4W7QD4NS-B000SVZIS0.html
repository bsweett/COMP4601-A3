<meta name="summary" content="The worst film Tim Burton has ever directed to date"></head><body><p>Undoubtadly the worst film that Tim Burton has ever directed; this re-make of Planet of the Apes tries hard to be a solid action/sci-fi film, but despite it's merits the film is just a mess.  Not to mention some flat casting with Marky Mark Wahlberg finding himself on a planet overrun with highly intelligent apes who are in charge and humans are slaves.  There are some nicely orchestrated action scenes (although some are just dull) and special effects to be found here, plus the ape makeup is fantastic and is reason enough to watch this otherwise dull movie.  The rest of the otherwise stellar cast is beyond wasted: Helena Bonham Carter (the best looking ape I've ever seen), Tim Roth (one of the best character actors around today), Paul Giamatti, David Warner, Kris Kristofferson, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Charlton Heston in an inspired cameo which pays great homage to the original film, but the absurd ending (which also tries to pay homage to the original film) is beyond laughable.  The DVD itself is loaded with tons of extras and Fox did an excellent job at assembling a superb DVD package, but it's just too bad the film is almost a waste.</p></body></html>

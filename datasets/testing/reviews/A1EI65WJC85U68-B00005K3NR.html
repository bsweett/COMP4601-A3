<meta name="summary" content="Classic example of 70s horror, if somewhat dated"></head><body><p>Although widely regarded as one of the classic horror films of the 70s CARRIE is one of those movies that has moments you love AND hate for a variety of reasons. The first adaptation of a Stephen King novel, CARRIE is notable for jump starting the careers of many involved.Carrie White is a high school misfit who lives in a rundown house with her fanatically religious mother.<br />The film opens with Carrie having her first period in the girls shower room. Ignorant because of her mothers religious beliefs, Carrie thinks she is dying, but when she turns to the other girls for help the other girls pelt her with tampons and chant "Plug it up!". When one of the teachers intervenes to help Carrie the lights in the locker room mysteriously explode.Carrie is sent home to her religious fanatic mother (Piper Laurie, returning to film after a lengthy hiatus) One of the girls who joined in the hazing, Susan Snell (Irving) feels ashamed and asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom as a special favor.  However her nemesis, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) is not so sympathetic and having been barred from attending the prom, when she hears Carrie is going she gets her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta) and his friends to kill a pig so they can dump the blood on her at the prom. Amazing that even dimwits like them can see the symbolism in the shower of blood. But come the night of the prom, predictably all hell breaks loose...<br />For those of you who haven't seen the movie to go any further would be to spoil it, but there have been some changes from King's novel,especially the classic final 20 minutes. The movie is lighter than the book, and De Palma does a good job on a limited budget. But the film is almost embarressingly dated in places (William Katt's hair for starters) and I hope the TV remake airs in NZ. That said, CARRIE remains one of the best  adaptations of Stephen King to film, and is still fun Halloween viewing more than 25 years later.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Back and Forth with The Lake House"></head><body><p>Most of the questions that came to me during a recent screening of THE LAKE HOUSE had nothing to do with the "time travel" aspect of the movie which I knew going in would be over my head.  But like everyone else, I respond viscerally to any movie that pairs Keanu Reeves with Sandra Bullock.  The two of them should star in all movies, in any year--2004, 2006, or now.  Think of how many films would have been much improved if only Reeves and Bullock had been available to take the title parts.  I'm thinking of MULHOLLAND DR, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, THE ICE AGE, even something like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN could have used Sandra Bullock playing the part Anne Hathaway did and tempting Keanu Reeves with her knowledge of rodeo driving.<br /><br />But my questions were more about, what is with the strange brother of Keanu Reeves, Henry, and his leonine hairline which looks as though hair grows out of his head backwards and gets crimped there?  Where did they find this actor, or the woman who plays Sandra's mother?  For her part, the producers might have been turned down by Marsha Mason so they decided to get the "foreign" Marsha Mason, with her odd Dutch or Malaysian accent but all of Marsha Mason's botox plumping out her face like a pin cushion.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD.)<br /><br />It made me uncomfortable all the time she was around, even discounting the fact that I believe the mother (played by Willeke van Ammelrooy) made that bus run over Keanu Reeves as she sat with her daughter at Dealey Plaza and realized, when she lifted her gaze and saw Alex Wyler begin to approach, that this was the man who would once and for all take Sandra away from her at last.  Did anyone else get this, or am I just reading into things?  Notice that once Keane and Sandra get together, you never see the mother again.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILERS.)<br /><br />I believe that the movie calls out for a sequel in which Keanu's character, Alex Wyler, and his architect brother, Henry (played by Ebon Moss-Bachrach) would use their newfound time travel powers to go back and save the life of their mother, the woman who broke Christopher Plummer's heart and who condemned her two boys to live lives of meaningless hedonism and avant-garde architecture.  As for the misery Sandra Bullock's character causes Dylan Walsh from NIP/TUCK, if I were Dylan Walsh I would try to get another agent after making a fool out of me in THE LAKE HOUSE, period.</p></body></html>

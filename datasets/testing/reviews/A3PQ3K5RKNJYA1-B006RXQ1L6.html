<meta name="summary" content="Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are ZUPER !!!!"></head><body><p>That's right, Zuper! Zuper! Richard Gere was great as the manipulative, money-hungry, publicity-grabbing laywer Billy Flynn working to get Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger) off of a murder charge. John C. Reilly's "Cellophane Man" was surprisingly entertaining. Along with of course, Richard Gere's great "puppet man" scene.<br /><br />But Zellweger really steals the show. Well, along with Zeta-Jones' super performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones with a real "triple-threat" performance (like that of Zellweger) really helped put this movie over the top. What a pair of bombshells. The Duo's closing number is awesome. Super choreography throughout the entire movie.</p></body></html>

Ron Livingston stars as Peter; a man so stuck in his cubicle at his dead end job that he undergoes hypnosis and decides not to do anything at all.  As he puts it best later on in the film: "It's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care."  When company downsizing starts, he surprisingly ends up getting promoted, but when his two friends are in line to be laid off, they hatch a scheme to skim funds from the company's accounts.  The film itself is laugh out loud hilarious from beginning to end, thanks to the great screen play and Judge's excellent direction.  The rest of the cast is perfect as well; including Jennifer Aniston as Peter's new girlfriend, Gary Cole as Peter's smarmy jerk boss, Diedrich Bader as Peter's hilarious mullett headed neighbor, and a scene stealing Stephen Root as Milton; the company's constantly pushed around and neglected mumbling employee whose trials and tribulations you'll bust a gut laughing at.  All in all, Office Space is hilarious and is a one of a kind comedy that oh so rarely comes along.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="kubrick gives us half of a great film"></head><body><p>once again i find myself at odds with most people(even close friends) over another kubrick movie. unlike "the shining" which i found boring(read my review),full metal jacket is half of a great movie,by which i mean that the first half  at paris island and the training of marine recruts is in  your face movie making at its best. lee ermey(a real life drill instructer) gives the acting job of a lifetime as the brutel d.i. in charge of whiping boys into marines. he is scary and in your face and you have to watch him. he really moves the movie onto another level and brings the words "break them" to a whole new level! just as good is vincent d'onofrio as a sad sack who just can't get it right. funny at first you see how his gental nature begins to warp as he is beat down mind and body by ermey and the other recruts as they start to get punnished for his failers. nothing is more heart breaking(or mind breaking) as his beating with soap wraped in towels by the other recruts. after this d'onofrio goes off the deep end and the end of the training part of the movie goes out with a bang!<br /><br />  this is where the movie really should end because we now go to nam and this movie never recovers the ground it had at first. it becomes a grade z war movie and you can tell what's going to happen well before it does. this part of the movie is so bad that it looks like a different movie and director. and the fact that it was shot in england also shows and drags the film down the drain.<br /><br />  matthew modine is the "star" here and he does a very nice job,but as said the first half is so good that the second half just really lets you down.  5 stars for the first half,-2 stars for the sad second half = 3 stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A modern classic"></head><body><p>I must have seen The Illusionist a dozen times by now and though I thought it was outstanding upon first viewing, I now think it stands as a classic in its own right. Apart from the pitch-perfect casting choices and the stand-out mesmerizing performance of Edward Norton, the film carries an unusual tone that's part romantic and part mystery, combining to create a sense of fantasy and false reality. For fans of The Prestige, although these were released around the same time, they are very different (and both excellent) films. For fans of Ed Norton or Paul Giamatti, both deliver outstanding performances and book-end a fascinating script that will make this a movie you find yourself coming back to.</p></body></html>

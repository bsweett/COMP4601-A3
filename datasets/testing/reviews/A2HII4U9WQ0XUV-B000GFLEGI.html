You can smoke 'em if you got 'em while you read:<br /><br />REVIEW#1: Is the "Zombies-crashing-through-the-barricades-haul-your-a**-into the Dead Reckoning NOW, Soldier!" version. "Land of the Dead" is some seriously bent, proudly trashy, flamboyantly bloodthirsty good times---nothing profound, not a zombie epic, perhaps---but it's like a big, juicy steak. If you like a nice saucy side of carnage with your Zombie Apocalypse, you've come to the right place, pardner. Chow down!<br /><br />REVIEW#2: This one assumes you've barricaded the gun-shop and you've got some good hunkering-down time.<br /><br />Alright, think about this one: the Zombie Apocalypse has arrived. Maybe it was some green goo that hitched a ride on the new Neptune XIII probe that just crashed to Earth.<br /><br />Or maybe it was some weird cosmic dust that passed through the atmosphere; or maybe it was a biochemical spill the Military didn't quite cover *all* the way up. Maybe, just maybe, some wild-eyed eco-freaks got a little too rowdy in the Monkey House section of the local Super-Dooper-Secret Biowarfare Research Laboratory.<br /><br />Maybe, even, there's just no more room in Hell. And, well, you know the rest.<br /><br />Who really cares about Cause, when the Effects are shambling all over town, trying to take a chunk out of your hide when all you want is a little peace, a little quiet, maybe a halfway decent smoke break.<br /><br />So anyway, you're a total uber-bada**, let's say, or maybe a survivalist, or you're just packing heat and keeping a cool head when things go south and the Dead Rise and start looking for some truly 100% American ground beef. You rally some bikers and soldiers and street thugs and seriously scared civvies to your side, you build up an arsenal (the Zombies aren't gonna use shotguns and M-16s, anyway), and you clear out some space. Make a safe zone.<br /><br />Soon you begin to realize it might be a juicy idea, once you've got some breathing room, to fortify central Pittsburgh, barricade the bridges, trip-wire the whole area, spike with some guard towers, and settle down.<br /><br />And when the smoke clears, you and your main Posse---the guys with you from the start, or maybe just the really scary critters---you start thinking: Hey, we made this place. We've got a little fortified City. As for Law & Order---well, the Constitution, the President of the USA, even the old US of A herself---all that has gone the way of the Dodo & the T-Rex.<br /><br />You're the Law, the Big Kahuna, the A-Number One. You set up your digs in the most lavish downtown skyscraper you can seize, fortify it, trade in the kevlar and camo for some Armani suits, and dispatch the peasants (all the scared normal folk who don't want to be eaten, ie, outside Fortress Pittsburgh) to the dead zone to bring back food, booze, guns, and cigars.<br /><br />As for your Living Large skyscraper---Fiddler's Green---, whaddya do? You do what any power-hungry dictator would do, given half a chance: you Charge Admission.<br /><br />That, zombie-hounds, is the guts and glory of "Land of the Dead", the blood-and-guts return of the Grandmaster of the Zombie Splatter Spectacular, George Romero. It's a wild world of Haves & Have-Nots, but this time the Rich *are* just like us. They're still human; the Have-Nots, on the other hand, just want some flesh for chow. So yeah, it's very Biblical: the Meek have inherited the Earth, along with a very nasty appetite.<br /><br />Throw in evolving zombies, a not-so-subtle post-9/11 subtext, bottle-rocket pacing, a storehouse of quotable quotes (from Dennis Hopper's "Zombies..they give me the Creeps, Man" to the hulking Manolete's "So let's DOOOOO some-THEENG"), a scantily clad Asia Argento in a cage with two really hungry zombies, and a class-clambering John Leguizamo and a full-bore rampaging Dennis Hopper---and you've got good times.<br /><br />It's too short by far, and it could have reached for more---but Romero has conjured up a brazen, bloody, irreverent, wantonly trashy, and totally politically incorrect helluva ride.<br /><br />This one is way overdue. Dig in.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

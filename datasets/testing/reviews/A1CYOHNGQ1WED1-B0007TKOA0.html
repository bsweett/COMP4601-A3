<meta name="summary" content="Sideways or right side up, its boring"></head><body><p>Sideways is about 2 friends who take a week-long trip through California wine country before one of them gets married, and hook up with two hot women. The good things were the acting was excellent and the dialogue was written by a real writer, not some of the hacks that write most of the movies made today. The bad is it was pretty dull most of the time. I've heard this called a comedy masterpiece but I didn't see it. I don't think I laughed out loud once; I smiled and chuckled a few times. I did end up rooting for something good to happen to Paul Giamatti's character in the end, but some of his problems wouldn't have exitsed if he had a backbone. Thomas Hayden Church's character had no redeeming qualities I could see and I saw no reason why the two guys were even friends. There was also a scene that was unnecessarily vulgar. I like some of what they tried to do with Sideways, but it didn't work well enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chick Flick Math for Guys"></head><body><p>Using this simple formula you can tell just how bad a "chick flick" will be for a guy to have to sit through. Add together the number of 1960's R&B tunes (double the points if tunes are used in a wacky lip-synch routine by one of the cast, or if cast members suddenly start serenading star with a 1960's song). Mulitply the number of songs by the number of "gay comic relief" characters in the movie. The formula might look something like this: Otis Redding + Aretha Franklin + Marvin Gaye + Van Morrison x 3-Gay Comic Relief = Get the Hell Out of the Theater NOW!! If you score above 10 points with this formuala.....leave the theater immediately, run home, and pop in an emergency copy of "Die Hard" kept close at hand for just this situation. "Hitch" is 100% pure Chick-Flick, my bag of popcorn came with breasts!!! The ads for this movie focused only on the funny scenes with Kevin James, who is actually only in the film for about 20 minutes, the majority of movie really focuses around Will Smith trying to seduce the too manly and often scary lead actress!! The movie is long, boring, full of every romantic movie cliche, I think this story was actually an old plot line from "The Love Boat"...in short...I had a great time watching "Die Hard" last night.</p></body></html>

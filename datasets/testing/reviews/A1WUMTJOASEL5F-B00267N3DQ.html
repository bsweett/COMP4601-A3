<meta name="summary" content="Still the fairest of Disney"></head><body><p>I am looking forward to the 2009 dvd edition because I have seen countless times my vhs masterpiece copy which still plays like a dream. True, I have quite a few dvd sets, but I am a diehard vhs fan with many still in current library and thanks to JVC for great dual systems to play alternate formats on one unit.<br />What I like about the discs are the compactability for on the go units such as laptop video units which I also have two of, and play very well, both Sylvannia & Go Video, so the convenience of watching my favorite movies or tv shows on discs is great. I also like the internet movies, but the discs I can view anytime and anywhere, and being my laptop videos are also battary operated is an added plus.<br />The features to these disc sets are also great, although I do find I dont have much time to look at everything, but I get them just in case the day comes I need extras to watch instead of the same film fare.<br />The recent Pinocchio platinum release just goes to show Disney movies just seem to get better with the revolution of video formats because the studios do extra enhancements to the film footage which make the color and sound vibrant with clarity.<br />The only complaint I have ever had with vhs format was the lack of freedom to skip randomly, and the need to "rewind" after each viewing whether the film has been entirely viewed or not.<br />So I look forward to another disney classic in my firm grasp such as this Snow White feature. It was a techno animated pioneer of its day when it introduced the first long length cartoon film which recieved many awards from the Academy. The animation still looks splendid with the effect of water color in landscapes. The songs are historical with Hi-Ho, and I cant count how many references Ive seen from many other non disney movies in regard to Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs lingo.<br />The intro scene of the queen consulting her magic mirror is the staple to disney villains. Snow White's eerie tree sequence as she escapes from henchman is still compelling and transfers well to the honored ride in Disneyland itself.<br />There are many historical facts to the making of Snow White as the frame by frame coloring of Snow White's rosey cheeks which was painstakingly done by disney artists. It's also a hoot to watch the live footage of men dressed as dwarfs which helped animators with the dance sequence. The queen transformation to the evil witch hag is one of the best fright night bits in movie history as her witch makes the biggest impression alongside the Wicked Witch of the Witch in Wizard Of Oz.<br />The final scenes of the dwarfs dealing with the poisoning of their princess is very well done and incredibly animated with reverence.<br />Snow White's prince, however, makes a very slight appearance throughout the movie and barely becomes much of a standout character because he is not given much to do other than become the apple of Snow White's eye (couldn't resist).<br />Needless to say, the seven dwarfs are the real stars because they are personality plus, and the cute animals all around are the charming backdrop to the whole feature.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Even Funnier Than I'd Figured"></head><body><p>I'd like to start off this review by saying (once again) that I wish that Amazon would let us do half-star ratings.  If so, I would probably give this movie 3.5 stars rather than 4, because, while it is very funny, I'm not sure if it is truly worhty of 4 stars.  However, I am rounding up, seeing as how it is definitely better than a 3 star movie.<br /><br />John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are wedding crashers.  They go to weddings with the sole intention of sleeping with women; they figure that the emotions that go hand-in-hand with a wedding make girls easier.  They come up with thourough backstories, names, and family connections so as not to raise suspicions toward themselves, and they follow a set of rules handed down to them by Chaz Reginold (Will Ferrel in an awesome cameo), an ex-crasher who is like the Elvis Presley of wedding crashing.  John and Jeremy are also successful divorce counselors when they aren't crashing.<br /><br />Near the end of "wedding season" one year, Jeremy is able to get them into a high-class wedding, where the bride is the daughter of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken).  While at the wedding, John meets Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy meets Gloria (Ilsa Fisher), both of whom are the bride's sisters.  Jeremy scores with Gloria, but it turns out that Claire has a boyfriend (Bradley Cooper), who of course is a brute and is cheating on Claire.  Jeremy is ready to leave, but John tries to stay in order to get closer to Claire.  This allows the somewhat insane and chemically imbalanced Gloria (she had an entire army of invisible friends as a kid) to get the pair invited to a weekend at one of the Secretary's mansions on a small island.<br /><br />While John tries to court Claire, Jeremy tries to avoid Gloria, who actually, at one point, rapes him (she doesn't see it that way, though).<br /><br />For the most part, this movie delivered very well.  It was a tad inconsistent, where at one point, people would laugh so loud that the dialogue was drowned out, but there were a few points when not much was going on.  The only truly slow point was near the end.<br /><br />One thing that I really liked dealt with Walken's character.  Instead of making him the stereotypical father-knows-best chacracter, they made him an actual father who just wanted his daughters to be happy.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the so-called "brat pack" (Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Jack Black), you'll love this movie.  Even if you're not, you should give it a try.</p></body></html>

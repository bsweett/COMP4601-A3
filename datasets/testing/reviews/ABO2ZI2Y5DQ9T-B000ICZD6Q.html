<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) A Little Light-weight But Pleasant Off-beat Comedy with Good Acting from Topher Grace"></head><body><p>Though director Paul Weitz is best known for teen comedy `American Pie' (with his brother uncredited Chris) `In Good Company' proves that his (their) main interest lies in more sophisticated comedy than `Pies' suggest. Actually, `In Good Company' is less likely to entertain you as comedy (though it is); its charms are more like that of satire based on well-acted character-driven drama.<br /><br />In short, it is about Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) 51 years-old working for a sports magazine for more than 20 years. After his company has been taken over by one mysterious "Teddy K" (uncredited Malcom McDowell), Dan is demoted from the job. His new boss is Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), hotshot manager who is half his age.<br /><br />In the corporate world this is nothing special, but what is special about the relation between them is that Carter falls in love with a nice college student Alex (Scarlett Johansson), who happens to be Dan's daughter. Interestingly, in spite of the demotion, Dan finds Carter likable and honest in his own way. But their unlikely and uneasy friendship is tested when Dan comes to know Carter is darting with his daughter.<br /><br />`In Good Company' is supposed to be about the corporate world where sheer nonsense can pass for wisdom, and quasi-religious faith often covers up the unreasonableness of business, but the satire of the film is not fully explored. There is nothing unique or original about what Paul Weitz says about the corporate world, and the office workers (including David Paymer) always look like caricatures, only found in the soundstage of Hollywood. Though the central three characters are interesting, the film is not totally clich&eacute;-free. The bored wife of Carter (Selma Blair, wasted) is a very thankless role, virtually pointless, and so is Philip Baker Hall, whose role is too weak to conclude the film with a satisfactory resonance at the end of the story. Even the role of Marg Helgenberger as Dan's wife lacks substantial weight, appearing intermittently to show you the image of perfect family.<br /><br />[GOOD ACTING FROM] However, the three principal actors -- Quaid, Grace, and Johansson - are so good that you almost forget these flaws of the film. Actually, for whatever reasons the film is praised so far, they cannot be without their good acting. There is considerable chemistry between Topher Grace and Dennis Quaid/Scarlett Johansson (though her role is smaller than the others), and thanks to them the characters are all believable.<br /><br />The best way to describe `In Good Company' is, to me, "a surprising good off-beat comedy." The characters sometimes look paper-thin, and there is no denying that Malcom McDowell as Teddy K is a very strange decision, but for all its lack of edge, `In Good Company' has sophisticated taste and humor to amuse us.</p></body></html>

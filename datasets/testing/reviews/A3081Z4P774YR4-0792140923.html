<meta name="summary" content="&quot;For no particular reason...&quot;"></head><body><p>A movie like &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; can easily be misinpereted or over-examined to death, despite the fact it has an obviously simple story behind it: a man (with a 75 I.Q., played by Tom Hanks) drifts through rather turbulent times (from the 1950's to early 1980's), and tries to find a purpose in the world. There is the story of &quot;Gump&quot; in a nutshell. There's no great hidden politicial or sociological agenda in the story, outside of the obvious fact that life needs to be experienced, not mourned over (not a good thing to hear for a mild cynic like me). This is one of those films that was a surprise to see in my teenage years (like &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, both equally good films) and despite the criticism of &quot;Gump&quot; (and believe me when I say I've heard just about all of them and then some), I have only this piece of advice: lighten up, will you?  The DVD itself has some interesting stuff, such as several mini-documentaries of the making of the film (including two sequences that were never completed), commentary with the filmmakers, and more.  It's a movie that a somewhat cynical man like myself isn't afraid to admit he has in his film library.</p></body></html>

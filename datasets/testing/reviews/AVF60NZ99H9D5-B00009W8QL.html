<meta name="summary" content="hang up--and you die"></head><body><p>A fairly decent thriller. 3& 1/2 stars is closer to what I would  give this film. I liked the direction--and Forrest Whitaker was perfect in the role of a detective who does his best to diffuse a deadly situation. Keifer Sutherland, never a great screen presense in my opinion,  wears out his welcome early on, as the nutjob with his high-powered rifle trained on our man Farrell trapped in said phonebooth. The twist ending was not bad at all--although, somehow, the entire damn enterprise could have been a bit shorter.<br /><br />Hey, it's worth $7.50 --that's what I paid at Target for it.</p></body></html>

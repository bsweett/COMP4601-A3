As things stand, although "Maria Full of Grace" isn't all that original and all that "off the beaten track," it does tell a fairly engaging story of a young woman with limited options who initially chooses a potentially dangerous shortcut to escape a life of quiet desperation, but then comes to her senses and tries to salvage something for herself.  The movie especially benefits from good, understated, naturalistic performances across the board.  The DVD features a fine, crisp image and a few modest extras.</p></body></html>

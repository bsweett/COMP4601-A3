<meta name="summary" content="A "under flat", "pedictable", "make no sense" movie"></head><body><p>First of all, this movie is not romance, nor a comedy but a drama. in the DVD menu they used a funny song that is more suitable for a comedy with happy ending not this kind of movie. maybe some people can laugh on some scenes but it didn't.<br /><br />storyline is far too predictable. lets get streight. I think they could increase the rating of this movie even to 4 stars if they used a happy end for this movie. It's Jennifer and vince. they can't do serious stuff. can they? ending of this movie although was serious and realistic but couldn't make any sense with such actor and acress.<br /><br />Third. acting were awful and disturbing. in most of the movie I had the feeling that I'm watching a cheap, no name TV production with amateur teenage actors. Vince was awful, most of the cast were terrible and jennifer was not as good as Rachel Green in Friends.<br /><br />If you are a collector of Jennifer or Vince's work, you have no choice but to buy it. but it's not worth the bucks you spend.</p></body></html>

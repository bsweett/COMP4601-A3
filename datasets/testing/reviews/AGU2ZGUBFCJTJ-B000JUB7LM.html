<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - 'Million Dollar' Bust"></head><body><p>Could this be the year? That appears to be the very question on everyone's mind this Oscar season and the answer always depends on who you are asking. Based on the fans of The Aviator, they believe co-heartedly that if the Boston Red Sox could lift their once-ancient curse then there is still hope for Martin Scorsese in the Best Director category. For Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator's only true competition (Sorry Sideways), Clint Eastwood could prove to be back in contention form. Though many critics praised last year's contender, Mystic River, it had nothing on the existential strength that was The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. But, seeing as how that was the last film in the trilogy, the field for Best Picture is left wide-open, but truthfully only two face a bout-to-bout battle for the prize. Do you feel lucky, punk?<br /><br />Frankie Dunn, quite possibly one of the best boxing trainers in the country, is not the type of person who will ever get close to anyone again, especially after his daughter wants nothing to do with him, returning all of his letters to her, and his champion-in-training abandon him for a chance at the big time. Then one day, a typical white-trash diner waitress named Maggie Fitzgerald walks into his gym and asks to be trained to fight in the ring. Dunn quickly refuses, stating being "tough is not enough". Eventually, after witnessing Maggie's sheer determination in her training, Frankie takes her on based on two conditions - that she listens to everything he says and that she does not ask any questions. Though begrudgingly brought together by fate, the two begin to form a solid father/daughter-like relationship together, each sharing a common bond with one another based on family abandonment lodged in their pasts. This relationship will be tested to its limits by an event none of them ever expected or ever wanted to face. The story for Million Dollar Baby is darn near impossible to define in precise terms. What starts out as not only an engaging and exhilarating boxing drama but also an emotionally stirring divulgence into the belief of second chances quickly, and all too suddenly, shifts gears into a pure spear-headed propagandist piece. Why did things have to go so disturbingly wrong? The first two-thirds of the film showcased some of the most heart-warming, breathtaking, and all-out inspirational boxing sequences this side of Raging Bull. Truly an Oscar tour-de-force from everyone involved. And then they had to go about and kill it, so to speak, with a conclusion that felt as if someone had side-checked the audience into a brick wall.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood, in the role of the hard-shelled - are not all his characters that way - boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, was mainly nominated for his performance due to his marquee name - Paul Giamatti deserved it more - but the character itself is too wild for even the most Hollywood of clich&eacute;s. It is both an appalling and disturbing sight to see critics and the public alike applaud a performance in which Eastwood comes in at the end of the film through the hospital wing like the "Angel of Death" to secretly kill a woman he raised as if she were his own daughter. Perhaps audience members were given the wrong perception on the real daughter that left him. Maybe she was the only one with the true sense about her. If you knew your father would end up doing what he did to Maggie, would you not leave him? The parish priest asks Frankie one day after exiting the morning service, "Why do you bother coming to church?", or something to that affect. This honestly has to be the most thought provoking question in the entire film after witnessing how he goes against practically every Christian teaching on the subject of valuing the human life in the book, specifically The Bible. Hilary Swank is obviously on tap to receive the Oscar for Best Actress this year at the Academy Awards for her performance as boxer in training Maggie Fitzgerald, but does she truly deserve the honor or rather is there a serious lack of true competition against her? Should she receive kudos for training excruciatingly hard for the role and floating gracefully around the boxing ring like a true woman champion? Sure, she deserves every bit of it. Should she be the one to receive two golden statuettes in such a short period of time while taking lead roles in such trash as The Core and The Gift? Not so sure about that one. Maggie also acts as a rather crude insult toward anyone from the South - in fact her entire family could actually be brought into this discussion while we are at it. In Million Dollar Baby, every individual who happens to be from the southern region of the country is portrayed as either a know-nothing country bumpkin, complete with inbred appearance, or a worthless piece of white trash that will never amount to anything in this world. This is the typical clich&eacute; of both Hollywood and the liberal establishment in general. They love it so much it kills them to see over and over again - if only.<br /><br />Overall, Michael Moore occultists, more accurately those left who have yet to buck up the nerve to take their Kool-Aid following the reelection of Bush-Hitler, can at most find some consolation in the fact that at least some left-wing propagandist piece could walk away with a golden statuette on Oscar night, though seeing as how it is not from the imagination of the grand-master himself it may mean little to them. Already the fringe leftists have a pathetic excuse for their bumbling actions claiming, "But at least Frankie was not cruel enough to do the deed while she was sleeping. Was it not the most touching moment when they said their good-byes before the end?" Sure, if your name is Michael Schiavo, master of illusions, willing to romanticize the concept cold-blooded murder in order to knock off your wife and collect on her life insurance  in which to live happily ever after with your mistress and your two children. Straight out, euthanasia is nothing more then a gussied up word used by liberal elitists to cover-up the act of cold-blooded murder, accepted only by the slack-jawed idiots churned out by donkey universities who can not put two-and-two together.<br /><br />"But", they stutter "should we truly allow those who are confined to wheelchairs, unable to move a single limb, live out the rest of their purposeless lives in utter agony?" Following that sense of logic, Christopher Reeve, in spite of whatever Brother John Edwards may want you to think, should have been put of his damn misery years before he actually died. In spite of how thickheaded the liberal establishment is, this should not be as complex an issue as it has been made out to be. First and foremost, your life does not solely belong to you; it belongs to the creator as well. God created everyone specifically in his image with a purpose in this life, though we may not know what that will be at the time, and he will take you from this world when he feels it is your determined time. You have neither the privilege nor the authority to dictate when and where you want to die. In spite of what the radical liberals may tell you otherwise, man is not higher up within the chain-of-command then God himself. Anything to the contrary is absolute sacrilege. And secondly, concerning the level of governmental authority over this issue, the 1997 Supreme Court case, Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, in which the nine justices were unanimous in their decision, determined that the United States Constitution did not allow the practice of assisted suicide and declared that it should continue to be outlawed in this country. In addition to that, Baby promotes the ideal that if you are able to reach the zenith of your life, the one true shot at the big time, that even if you fail doing so you will have achieved your purpose in this world and you may therefore die with a sense of dignity having nothing left to live for. Perhaps that one could be explained more clearly to Mr. Eastwood, whether he actually wins on the big night or not, by taking a quick pot-shot to his head on his way to the limo. After all, does it not make sense for him to practice what he preaches? Million Dollar Baby is positively insulting, bordering on the line of being flat-out slanderous, both to Catholicism and the respect for quality of life in general. There should be no respect left for Clint Eastwood, either in the realm of films or politics, after this travesty.<br /><br />Believe what you want, but the liberals of this country view the cruel methods of abortion and euthanasia (assisted suicide) as the justifiable means in which to purge themselves of the responsibility they have toward another human life. If that is the direction in which we as a collective national society are heading towards in terms of our moral values then we are all royally screwed, both within this life and the next.</p></body></html>

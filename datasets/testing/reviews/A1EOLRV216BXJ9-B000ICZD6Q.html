<meta name="summary" content="A warm movie"></head><body><p>I thought this would be a romantic comedy about two young people, Scarlett Johansson and Topher Grace, both of whom I really like, but I was wrong. The movie is more about a middle-aged man and a father-to-be (Dennis Quaid). He was handling a job crisis (his company was just taken over), a financial crisis (his baby coming and his eldest girl transferred to NYU), middle-age crisis (his new boss was young enough to be his son and the "old and traditional" people could not compete with the "young and inspiring")  as well as an emotional crisis (daddy girl has grown up and moved out). To make it more difficult, he has always treated his co-workers as a family and now he had to fire some of them as a consequence of synergy. All he could hang on to was his family. However, even as he has always treasured his closeness with his eldest daughter and expected her to keep no secrets from him, things were not the same anymore.<br /><br />When things didn't come at all as expected, at work or at home, he had to juggle between upholding his principles or making compromises. Actually he did a bit of both. I must say I am most impressed by Dennis Quaid. He played the role well and the struggles he has to face are so real.<br /><br />Having said that, the romantic part of the movie is still well presented. Especially well-played is Topher Grace, the 26-year old ambitious young man who, inspired by Dennis Quaid, ultimately embarked on a new course heading one step closer towards his dream.<br /><br />I like the movie because the ending is not so Hollywood and  the theme in the movie is consistent- that people are most important and the most valuable asset, both in a family and in a company; that people can still be upright and successful; and people, regardless of their age, can still hope for a better future.</p></body></html>

This film is drected by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), he just happens to be married to Winslet - I love how dark and unsettling this film is - the ending was uncomfortable to watch but definitely not forgettable in any sense. DiCaprio and Winslet are incredible and gifted actors, their chemistry is smoldering, don't expect a Titanic kind of film though. Probably the best film of 2008, I highly recommend it!</p></body></html>

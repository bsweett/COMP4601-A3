Yes that is correct, a shopping mall!  Overpriced clothes and overrated albums that fill the music store shelves are all obstacles and cover for a supreme setting!  Zombies are everywhere and when they realize that the place where the indoctrination is highest is the mall, which is where they go!  Some humans are there and they are hiding from them.  Now, don't you think that was kind of strange?  If you are going to hide, the mall is one of the last places of resort.  Well I can understand that it is a movie so we need some action followed by a showdown and rescue.  The extra features are so fun and they have the video diary of this goofball who was on the adjacent roof.  This guy was starving to death which of course can show you how even the humans are not always prepared.  I am sure he had some eco friendly water around but realized it was better used to keep the toilet from reeking.  Then it also shows the importance of owning a gun so that you can protect yourself when attacked, because in real life as well as this movie, the police are reactive and not proactive.  And well, we know what happens in the movie when they are reactive, all mankind loses.  A flamethrower would have been a nice touch, but who's complaining?</p></body></html>

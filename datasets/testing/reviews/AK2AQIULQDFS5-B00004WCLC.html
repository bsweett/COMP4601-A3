Brilliant!!"></head><body><p>How the Hell did the Academy chose which actors to nominate for this film, that would have driven me crazy. If you look at the cast list, you'll obviously see alot of exceptionally talented actors. And if you watch the film, you'll be shocked to see that nearly every one of them is also in their best role. Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Phillip Baker Hall, John C Reilly, William H Macy. They are all (once again) Phenominal. The opening 5 minutes of the film is also one of the greatest openings i've ever seen.. Ever. Did I mention that the middle and the End are also brilliant, It really is a great film. If your still sceptical.. See it anyway, at over 3 hours, your bound to find something you like.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Charming After All These Years"></head><body><p>Heck, this 1978 version of SUPERMAN was nostalgic even when it originally was released.  Featuring the likes of Marlon Brando, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Glenn Ford, and Susannah York, the film instantly became a Who's Who of established screen heavyweights.  And you can never, ever, go wrong with Gene Hackman as the villain; his Lex Luther character could very well be the best known--and best loved--bad guy in cinematic history.<br /><br />Yet--despite its numerous cornball supreme moments that still have me grimacing--the best thing SUPERMAN has going for it is charm.  This is a gloriously charming film, from its visuals of rolling wheat fields in Kansas, to its (at the time) state-of-the-art special effects--to its ever-respectful homage to its TV series predecessor.  Christopher Reeve plays the Man of Steel with humility, grace, and yes, humanity (Krypton or no Krypton).  Reeve turned out to be a home run for director Richard Donner.  Alas, Margot Kidder is just plain annoying as an aggressive, overbearing, man-eating Lois Lane, but she's merely an irritant that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of this film.<br /><br />SUPERMAN is a light, fun, and entertaining movie--a lusciously glorious dose of good vibes nostalgia.<br />--D.

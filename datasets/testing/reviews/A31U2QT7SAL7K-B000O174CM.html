<meta name="summary" content="At this year's Oscar's , DEY WUZ ROBBED!!!"></head><body><p>2006's "Dreamgirls" shares much in common with 1985's "The Color Purple": a film with a mostly-black cast helmed by a white director (the latter guided by Bill Condon and the former by Steven Spielberg), a story adapted from another medium ("Purple" from Alice Walker's bestseller and "Dreamgirls" from the Broadway hit), a running time of over two hours ("The Color Purple" at 154 minutes while "Dreamgirls" runs at only 131), and multiple Oscar nominations but with few or no wins (eleven for "Purple" with no wins, eight for "Dreamgirls" with only two wins).<br /><br />It is the latter reason that is the greatest injustice.  Though he was nominated for best supporting actor, Eddie Murphy lost to Alan Arkin in the category and that loss was one of Oscar's greatest blunders.  Murphy is spectacular as the over-the-top-soul-man James "Thunder" Early in what could truly be described as that proverbial "role of a lifetime."  It's as though he was destined to play that part and he should have received an Oscar for his efforts.<br /><br />However, his is not the only ouststanding acting job in the film.  Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, Keith Robinson, and, in a lesser yet pivotal role, Danny Glover, all deliver brilliant performances and, for that, the film presents one of the best ensembles of the year.<br /><br />This multi-disc compilation is a packaging wonder.  Sporting a version filled with an extended cut, featuring twelve not-in-the-theatrical-version songs, a plethora of bonus and entertaining features/featurettes, this, like the movie, is entertainment of the highest value.<br /><br />'Tis a shame that Oscar voters didn't quite see it that way.</p></body></html>

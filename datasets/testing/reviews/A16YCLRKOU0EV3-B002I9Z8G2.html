<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Trek films"></head><body><p>There are no deleted scenes included in this dvd, which makes sense, because this is the only film besides Forrest Gump which test audiences said was fine as is. I read another review of this which consisted of a list of complaints abotu the film. That being said, anyone who really appreciates movies will love First Contact, both in the context of Trek, and as an action/scifi/drama movie.</p></body></html>

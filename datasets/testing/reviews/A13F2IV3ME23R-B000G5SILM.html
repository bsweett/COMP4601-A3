Way to go, Jack. &lt;g><br />And there are too many innocent people being set up by the corrupt men and women floating around D.C.<br /><br />I enjoyed the chase - the pace - the characters - most Secret Service guys are great --<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie for the story and the execution - the enjoyment of good entertainment.</p></body></html>

A combination of good fun, and strangeness."></head><body><p>Upon entering I tried to allow all of the hype to dissipate from my mind so as not to skew my thoughts.  I think I achieved that, although for the most part I still agree with the hype's conclusion: this movie is pretty funny.<br /><br />The humor is like "Old-School" except for a certain sense of believability which set in about a third-of-the way in, (and summarily left near the end).  In addition, the same crudeness preludes, particularly in the opening five-minute scene, but also just throughout the film in general.  And that's to be expected, because this is not a drama, as much as it's a comedy about some-sort of romance.<br /><br />Speaking of the story, it's probably a good time to go into the plot.  Vaughn and Owen play two best-friend psychologists named John and Jeremy, respectively; at least I think they are psychologists (not that it really matters).  But in the peak times of eternal love, they are wedding crashers looking for short "romance", and they are rather successful wedding crashers at that.  But there would be little to the story if that was all, and it's not, so to elaborate further.<br /><br />John and Jeremy, at the pleading bequest of Jeremy, decide to pull off one of the grandest crashes yet, the wedding of the oldest daughter of Secretary Cleary.  They assume elegance will abound, and yacht talk too, but what they don't realize is that maybe this time love is in the air for them too, and away they, and we, go on their cupid journey.<br /><br />The film really isn't bad, unless you completely despise some of the slapstick/vulgar humor (which I could see why).  Most of all though, this film is pretty entertaining and rather light-hearted, and for many that's what films are about, (for better or worse).</p></body></html>

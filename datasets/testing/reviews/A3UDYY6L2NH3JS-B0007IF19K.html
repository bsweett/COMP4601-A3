That's the first and best aspect of the film we have to emphasize. The music is marvellous and has been in our ears and heads for more than fifty years. The phenomenal mixing and blending of R&B, blues, gospel, country music and jazz turns Ray Charles into a unique prophet of our musical imagination and world, and that will remain true for at least fifty more years. But the film follows Ray Charles practically from his birth till his death. It shows how he got involved in many deep and fundamental social, cultural, musical and racial movements to change the world when necessary. It shows the personal problems he had to face and solve in order to last in his creativity and humanity, particularly his decision to drop heroin in one single weaning session. It shows how he was able to separate his family life from his professional life, and his wife was able to follow him along this line, so that these two lives never mixed, at least not entirely. But he had an admirable wife. It also shows the great changes that occurred in the USA over the last sixty years, the tremendous reduction of racism and segregation, even the important first steps on the road towards repentance and reparations. The road has not reached its destination yet, but it is coming closer. Finally this film shows the absolute blend of the whole life of a man, and every single moment will remain alive for him forever, and his creativity, here Ray's music. When a man creates something he has to invest every single fiber of his muscles and every single cell of his brain into it to make it his truest ever child. That is what Ray was able to do and he did it over and over again in his long professional life. His decision to refuse to perform in a segregated theater in Georgia and his subsequent ban from Georgia for life was a better thought and felt decision than many other decisions of his in his whole entire life, and yet it was taken on the spur of the moment. That is the sign of a great man and a great mind.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

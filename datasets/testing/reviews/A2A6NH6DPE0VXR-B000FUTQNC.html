We've seen a lot of movies like that before. Even Hostage last year is a similar film. The script here can be silly from time to time but it's still a more entertaining movie than Hostage. Harrison Ford may be getting too old for parts like this but he's still in top form here. Mary Lynn Rajskub who plays Chloe in 24 isn't bad here either eventhough she's basically playing Chloe and she even gets to call Harrison Ford Jack. Paul Bettany also isn't bad as the villian eventhough I liked him more as one in the Da Vinci Code. One thing I find silly though is that while the bad guys take the family they also bring the family dog. Why do they need the dog ?</p></body></html>

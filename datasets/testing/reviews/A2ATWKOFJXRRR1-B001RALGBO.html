<meta name="summary" content="Bad Screenplay Can't Save This Planetary Dumper"></head><body><p>A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) is trying to convince some stuck-up politicians that the Earth is going do go through some serious climate changes (maybe even an ice age) in the next 100 to 1000 years. But he's wrong. It's coming 'The Day After Tomorrow.' He's also having trouble with his son (a boy genius who get's stuck in New York when some bad-boy weather begins to brew), his wife (a doctor who refuses to leave a cancer-ridden child even when the weather turns into a giant planet-wide storm), and the Vice President (who's more concerned with money than lives). <p>Needless to say, our climatologist finally gets his point across when the weather patterns change so drastically that people freeze spontaneously if they go outside, giant waves inundate New York City (and trap our hero's son in the NY Library along with some other holdouts), and three massive hurricanes cover North America, Europe and Siberia.<br />****************************************************************<br />Where this film runs into problems is in it's believability, it's corny lines, it's status quo characters, and so many characters that you don't become emotionally involved with any of them in any way, shape or form. <p>#1--Wolves DO NOT attack humans. EVER. There has never been a documented case of a wolf attack on a human being! Not to mention the wolves that do escape from a holding pen and start roaming the NY streets are computer generated (and it's WAAAAY too obvious that they are). <p>#2--Climate changes wouldn't occur in such a widespread pattern in such a short period of time. Ever. Even in past ice age research there's no evidence for this. Ask even the most vehement environmentalist with any knowledge of climatology and they'll confirm this. <p>#3--Let's see how many characters we can shove into one film: We've got the President and Vice President; a climatologist and his family; a weather researcher (Ian Holm) and his cohorts stuck at a weather station and doomed to freeze to death; a group of teenagers stuck in the NY Library; Astronauts on the space station viewing the destruction from the safety of their cozy tin can; and a child with cancer who needs to be moved out of a hospital before the big freeze sets in permanently. <p>Add to this quagmire some bad dialogue and character personalities we've seen MILLIONS of times and...well...you can see where problems would arise. <p>The makers (or screenwriters) of this film, couldn't even keep the climate changes permanent! In the end, they had to make it warm and fuzzy for...Oh, who the hell knows why!<br /><br />So this film didn't impress me at all, as you can see. Unlike other disaster films that set a new standard for films in this genre (The War of the Worlds, etc.), this film is bound to be forgotten.<br /><br />D rating.</p></body></html>

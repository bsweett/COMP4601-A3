<meta name="summary" content="A Great Remake Compared to "Psycho""></head><body><p>I've seen every single "TCM" movie and I own every single one except this one but I saw this in the theatre and this was awesome.Now unlike "Psycho" the film isn't the same as the original with only little resemblance.The characters Erin,Kemper,<br />Morgan,Aaron,and Pepper are driving through Texas with a pinata full of weed and they pick up a shell shocked hitchiker instead of a freaky guy with knife.She warns them not to go any farther before pulling a gun out and shooting herself point blank in the head.They freak out and pull into a gas station where they meet an old woman who tells them the Sheriff played rather hilariously by R.Lee Ermey will meet them at an old mill.Now the story begins its resemblance with Erin and Kemper going to an old house where they meet an old legless man who allows Erin to use the phone and that is where we see the first glimpse of Leatherface.I can see where a lot of people didn't like this film but in my oppinion it was a good movie and was truly deeply haunting.The film has some of the goriest scenes in recent movie<br />history and Leatherface hasn't looked that cool since Gunnar Hansen portrayed him in the original.If you are a horror fan you need to buy this movie plain and simple,get it.

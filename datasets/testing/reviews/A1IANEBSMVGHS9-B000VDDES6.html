<meta name="summary" content="Not as funny as Will Ferrell can be"></head><body><p>I had a chance to check out "Anchorman" not too long ago. I didn't have too high expectations, though I'd heard good things about it. Well: the movie left me scratching my head. It sure had some funny moments, but for the most part it reminded me of how boring of an experience watching "Old School" was: thematically, it was lame, and it made me wonder how good a comedian can Will Ferrell be, while continuing to pull off such bad movies. I won't recommend it, not even if you have nothing else to do on a weekend night.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An older Harrison Ford can still turn the tables on villains"></head><body><p>Without warning, one rainy night, Jack Stanfield's wife and kids are taken hostage in their own house. Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), the mastermind behind it all, gives Jack (Harrison Ford) this option: steal 100 million from a Seattle bank, of which Jack is the chief of security - or Jack's family dies. The cat-and-mouse games begin when Jack seeks to thwart the callous but vigilant Bill Cox, who in turn seems to anticipate and foil Jack's attempts. The tension is ratcheted higher and higher as Jack's every scheme of escape goes awry and Cox's temper is further tested. Later, his family having vanished, the friend he desperately turns to having just been murdered, and having no other recourse, Jack must rely on his savvy secretary Janet Stone (who he had just fired) for help. Where's Han Solo when you need him?<br /><br />Harrison Ford once again ably portrays a role he's pigeonholed for himself:  that of the cerebral action hero. Holy Octogenarian, Ford is looking ancient (any forthcoming Indy Jones film better happen sooner than later). But his advancing age actually works in his favor, making the peril more credible. Jack Stanfield is older and greyer and, looking at him, one isn't entirely sure he'll be able to overcome adversity. But, fortunately, while the physical nature is diminished in Ford, the intelligence and suppressed intensity remain. Paul Bettany is an actor who is up and coming; his star is definitely on the rise. In his yet early carrer, he's already played several eclectic parts: from his verbose Geoffrey Chaucer (A Knight's Tale) to the cello-playing Dr. Maturin (Master & Commander), from the romantic lead Peter Colt (Wimbledon) to Silas, the tortured albino villain, in The Da Vinci Code. Here he brings an icy British demeanor to his greedy and amoral kidnapper character. To be honest, I don't think his Bill Cox vicious enough. On separate occasions, he places members of Jack's family in jeopardy, only to not follow thru, on Jack's pleading behest. No wonder Jack keeps rebelling. Virginia Madsen offers an earnest performance with her thankless role of kidnapped mother. The kid actors are...well, they don't get in the way. Robert Patrick adds his own brand of internalized focus and Alan Arkin and good old Robert Forster have good bit parts. Mary Lynn Rajskub's Janet Stone is reminiscent of her Chloe from 24, which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Firewall isn't up to par with most of the pictures in Harrison Ford's scintillating resume, but having said that, it's still a pretty decent offering served up by this iconic film star. Not overtly familiar with computer technology, I don't have an expert opinion about the computer-oriented doings and their working validity. To be honest, I glossed over all the techno-babble, preferring to pay closer attention to the more diverting jeopardy presented in those same scenes. I still don't quite get the thing about the iPod. Sometimes, I really miss the abacus. Anyways, this is an intense thriller, with director Richard Loncraine never allowing the audience to forget about the family's peril for one sec. Amidst the somberness of the film, however, are fleeting moments of levity: a very quick scene where Jack and Janet attempt to start her car, Janet invading the stage where a band is performing just to borrow a cell phone, etc. But, yes, humor is in short supply. Then again, this movie isn't supposed to be a  comedy.<br /><br />Overall, the competence and star power of these actors overcome the sometimes derivative storyline. I did enjoy this movie and I do recommend Firewall, with the caveat that folks who've seen Ford's best shouldn't expect the same level of excellence here.</p></body></html>

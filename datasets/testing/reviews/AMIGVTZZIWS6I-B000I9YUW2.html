The best thing about the movie is Julianne Moore's wonderful performance as a mother who refuses to forget the son everyone tells her never existed.  In the end, it's that mother's love, that fetal link between mother and child, that is ultimately the undoing of the alien experiment.  Because of that, the movie is certainly worth viewing.  If you have the opportunity, watch both the theatrical version and the extended alternate ending.  In my opinion, the theatrical ending is the much better of the two.  The alternate ending is just too X-Files for my tastes.</p></body></html>

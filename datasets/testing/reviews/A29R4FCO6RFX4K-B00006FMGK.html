<meta name="summary" content="The Final Journey?"></head><body><p>Apparently the final film in the long-running STAR TREK film series, NEMESIS is simply the best of the franchise. It also works as a marker to show how far the films have come since the first snooze-fest STAR TREK. Stuart Baird's direction makes this one a tautly-paced, exciting adventure with fantastic special effects and a great score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. Both Patrick Stewart as Picard and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker turn out great peformances, and the added gravitas fills the void left by previous Trek movies. There are some complaints; the middle section tends to drag on for a while and the cop-out ending seems to contradict the well-known publicity about this one being the last. But this is minor carping, as the film as a whole is great fun.</p></body></html>

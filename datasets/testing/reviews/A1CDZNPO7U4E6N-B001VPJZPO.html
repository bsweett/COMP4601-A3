A hospice nurse who's just been hired to be the live-in caretaker of a dying old man and his elderly wife in Louisiana. Personally, being from the deep South this movie ringed way too true for me. None-the-less the longer Caroline stays in the house with the couple events start to occur leading Caroline to believe that there may be something more of a spiritual nature going on. It's that curiosity that prompts her to start digging around into some of the ancient practices of hoodoo. The deeper Caroline gets she starts questioning whether to believe, or not to believe in these practices, or what she's witnessing with her own eyes day by day. The ending was most impressive to me. I hate to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. However, I saw this movie with my sister, and we both came to the conclusion that the spirits (if you will) in the house were those of the 2 children. We never guessed that the spirits were the 2 black slaves that were lynched on that plantation after being caught by the white owners teaching the black arts to their children. Not only that, they were possessing bodies to live again, but the only way they could do that was you had to believe or have faith in the magic to begin with. I thought it was deep!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Eyes Have It"></head><body><p>This movie made me squirrely, disconcerted, agitated, not because it was a movie with an important message to convey, but because it was exploitive and edgy just for the sake of edginess.<br />It's a futuristic overwrought work in which a precrime unit in Washington, DC, in 2054 prevents murders by using pre-cogs, pre-cognitive slaves who can see into the future and predict crimes that are going to take place. The three pre-cogs, male twins and a woman are kept in a vat of water with electrodes attached. The means justifies the ends, get it.<br />Tom Cruise is head of the unit; he's an anally-retentive, wired spring about to snap. He seems constipated or suffering from hemorrhoids throughout. He plays the role with extreme seriousness. Warning: the series of scenes about his eyes are very disconcerting. Scanners can identify people by their eyes so you get the picture.<br />Without giving any of the plot away, it's sufficient to say all the stuff regarding Tom Cruise's eyes is excruciatingly painful to view.<br />It's an unrelenting movie in which the tables are turned, and the crime fighters target Cruise. In super-hero fashion he fights off platoons of "cops," and learns that he has been set up. His escape with the female pre-cog is harrowing and too disconcerting. He performs unbelievable feats in his escape.<br />Max von Sydow is very good as Cruise's wily boss. Colin Farrell has a one-dimensional role that doesn't give him a chance to show off his real acting talent. Veteran actress Lois Smith is very good as the morally reprehensible "mad" scientist who even makes a pass at Cruise.<br />If this is your taste, you'll love it. If it isn't, you may cringe. Optical surgeons may shed a few tears over it. I realize mine is a minority report; most people are going be ga-ga eyed over this flick.</p></body></html>

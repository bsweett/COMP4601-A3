<meta name="summary" content="A RIVETING, COMPELLING, INSTANT CLASSIC  8.75 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I Am Legend is one of the better films to come out of Hollywood in a while. It's dramatic, compelling, bizarre, and it can be rather suspenseful.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: In 2009, a virus ravaged the world and killed most of the population. There is virtually no one left except for the few people who are immune to the virus. But most of the immune were killed off by the infected. One man; Robert Neville; is the last man in Manhattan. He was a military virologist when the outbreak occurred, now he lives in Manhattan with a German shepherd named Samantha, trying to survive and find a cure for the virus and see if there is anyone else left alive.<br />MUSIC: The music is good, especially considering the guy who did this film's music also did the music for The Happening.<br />COMPELLING FACTOR: This film isn't exactly action-oriented, but it is rather great at setting the stage for suspense and dramatic, depressing moments.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: If you're hoping for an action-packed film you're not going to get one. This film is more focused on story and characters than action. It is a compelling movie that is worthy of a purchase. If you easily get bored of movies, you probably won't like this one, but give it a try.<br />OVERALL: There were parts of the movie that got boring, that is the main flaw. But the rest of the movie is superbly executed and creates a dramatic, compelling post-apocalyptic world.<br />THE GOOD: Good storyline, cool action scenes, great characters, and good music.<br />THE BAD: Boring scenes of nothing.</p></body></html>

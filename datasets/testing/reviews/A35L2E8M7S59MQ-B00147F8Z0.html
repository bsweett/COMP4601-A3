First I'll begin with saying that I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise of movies and find the Predator franchise fun, but nothing really more than blockbuster films.  Secondly I'd like to say most movies I find some redeeming value in, be it silly, or serious.  From Ed Wood to films to many others of that nature there are bad films that you might find entertaining in their sheer absurdity.  AVP: R is not one of those movies.<br /><br />So what could possibly make this movie so horrific bad?  I mean everyone thought an R-rated AVP movie would be a great way to counter the let down of Paul W.S. Anderson's PG-13 film released several years prior...well the rating may say "ages 17 and up" as opposed to Anderson's "Ages 13 and up" but somehow the Strausse brothers have managed to make an even more childish movie than has ever managed to defile either one of these two franchises.<br /><br />This movie takes the Alien and Predator franchises where they've never been before.  A wondrous realm of endearing horror that surely no one would ever associate with either franchise; I am of course talking about the most infamous of horror sub-types aside from zombies: the dead teenager genre.  Essentially both Alien and Predator have both been beaten to death and buried by Fox (Alien Resurrection, Predator 2, and AvP) but none can compare to the audacity of Aliens versus Predator Requiem.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the Predator-Alien hybrid (as seen at the end of the first AvP) running amuck throughout a small Colorado town.  Their goal?  To rip-off as many scenes from the original Alien movies as possible! Why of course!  Of course a predator has to be involved for this to be Aliens versus Predator so a Predator, named `Wolf' by the production team (after the Pulp Fiction character - they forget the timeless rule of "Never reference good movies in your bad one") comes in to cover up the signs of the aliens...which you soon realize makes little to no sense because as fans know Predators are not ones for subtlety; between their skinning people alive, hanging them, skull ripping, and nuclear explosives they do not make for ones who care much about covertly cleaning up a mess they made.<br /><br />But somewhere the script forgot this was a horrifically bad action movie so they tried to add in some poorly scripted drama and clich&eacute; characters.  As if this movie couldn't get any worse they got the dead-teenager route to produce some of the most moronic characters I have ever laid witness to - EVEN by dead-teenager standards these characters are bad!<br /><br />Then we have the special effects which in their own way give this film even more of a sci-fi channel original feel.  I have never seen CGI and animatronics look quite as fake as this.  Those rare people who complain about the puppet facehuggers and chestbursters of the original Alien films- not to worry!  In cheap CGI they truly look horrific.  The effects are not subtle, and the gore is so stupid that even if you're one who enjoys schlock films you won't find any amusement.<br /><br />So let's overview this:<br />Alien movie: Fails<br />Predator movie: Fails<br />B-horror movie: Isn't even cheesy enough to be that entertaining<br />Gore:  Stupid, pointless, and no fun even for a raging gore-a-holic<br /><br />This movie is one to avoid at all costs.  It's dumb, every other scene rips off its far superior predecessors, and the directors seem to have no control over the mess.</p></body></html>

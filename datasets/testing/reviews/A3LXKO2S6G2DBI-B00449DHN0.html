<meta name="summary" content="Mostly a Technical Achievement But Worth One Look"></head><body><p>I have to admit that Martin Scorcese's "Gangs of New York" threw me; on the one hand, it's one of the more brilliantly cinematic American films to come along in years, with more in common with the sense of artistic maturity known to films 40 years ago than the usual scatterbrained claptrap boxed up and shipped stinking to theaters today.  One can see strains of the great international directors, too, from David Lean to Akira Kurasawa to Bernardo Bertulucci in Scorcese's vision, though he seems to equally raid the Mad Max sequels, stockpiles of Victorian Era clipart, and everyone's favorite muckraker, Upton Sinclair.  On the other hand, I felt like the story of European immigrants and their unending hostility to each other and everyone else has been told so many times in one form or another that a roll of the eyes was in order.  And it's still another gangster movie.  I finally came down on the film being closer to the superb side.  That the main plot ultimately boils down to a simple revenge story--and, too often, I did not care about the plight of its characters, who are more animals than people, even with their hypocritical pretensions of civilization--is surmounted by a tour de force of acting and spectacle, most of it driven by Scorcese's attention to period detail.  In short, the director is in top form as a visualist, certainly better than in the much-hyped but dramatically weaker "The Aviator."  He's so good here, he manages to get a watchable performance out of Leonardo DiCaprio, but thinking-man's villain Daniel Day-Lewis and batty rumpshaker Cameron Diaz are the showhorses in this lavish production about the sociopathic goings-on in the crime-ridden slums of Old New York.  It's not the sort of film I'd need to watch twice, but it certainly held my attention more than I would have expected.</p></body></html>

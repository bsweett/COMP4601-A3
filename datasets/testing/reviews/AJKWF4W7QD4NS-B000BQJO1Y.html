<meta name="summary" content="The all time classic that shook the horror genre"></head><body><p>Whether the upcoming remake is any good or not doesn't matter; George Romero's 1979 follow up to the legendary Night of the Living Dead can still dish out the chills nearly 25 years after it's initial release.  We all know the story by now: four people barricade themselves inside a shopping mall while hordes of the undead hungrily try to claw their way inside.  Dawn of the Dead is nothing short of epic with great, taut performances and Tom Savini's landmark gut ripping gore effects, plus the satirical stab at consumer culture that made the film a hit with critics.  The film still manages to be shocking to this day, and it has aged quite gracefully.  Anchor Bay finally decided to re-release Dawn of the Dead on DVD, and it features a fantastic commentary by Romero, Savini, and crew.  Other than that, the extras are a bit lacking, even though a deluxe edition is supposedly due out later this year.  All in all, if you've ever called yourself a horror fan, than Dawn of the Dead deserves a place in your film library.</p></body></html>

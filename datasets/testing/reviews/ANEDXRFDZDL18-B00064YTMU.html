When Max gives a free cab ride to a beautiful woman, his next rider turns out to be Victor, the lovable but-oh-so-evil killer for hire. Can Max grow a spine and escape Victor or will he become just another of Victor's victims? I really enjoyed Collateral, despite some initial misgivings after seeing the trailer. Max was an endearing character and a loveable loser. Victor was funny, and despite being a killer had some spot-on advice for Victor. I particularly liked the scene where Max was forced to impersonate Victor at the club.<br /><br />There were a few minor peeves (such as the rather stupid chase scene at the end), in which the two lead characters failed to elude Victor (Yeah right), and a few scenes just showing them in the cab driving around town doing nothing which could've been edited out.<br /><br />Overall, a fast fun film sure to please action fans!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A spare, simple film full of endless enigmas."></head><body><p>'the Others' is the best Hollywood movie of the year, a genuinely spooky ghost story; that rare thing in this age of high concepts, preview audiences, market research and CGI effects, a film that is all about plot, that uses plot to reveal (and conceal) character, that uses the consoling properties of plot (explanation, resolution, reconciliation) to create further ambiguities and mysteries.<p>in its story of a woman who may or may not be seeing ghosts; of seemingly malevolent servants; of innocent children in danger of corruption; the film has been compared to Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw', the scariest book ever written.  it shares with that tale a slow-burning, nerve-fraying suspense narrative; a vividly atmospheric locale (in this case a remote manor on a remote English island further removed from Britain having been occupied by the Germans) and a mood of barely suppressed panic.  Working in a popular medium under a studio system, director Amenebar cannot follow James into completely terrifying irresolution, but there are sequences where the tension goes beyond the confines of narrative into the truly uncanny, such as the scene where Kidman leaves the house at the pitch of the action, walks down a cold and forlorn wooded lane, the first time we have been out of the estate's confines, and is soon lost in fog.<p>Amenebar is a Spaniard and has taken a predominantly Protestant genre - the haunted house story - with its pseudo-rationalist basis in psychological or allegorical crises, and infused it with a very scary Catholic mythology, such as Hell and Limbo, the idea of being dead but unrested forever; the idea of photosensitive children forced to live like moles in endless night.  The film is full of brilliantly low-key nuances rarely spoken about in British cinema or culture - the one German invasion in British soil (with Kidman's possible collusion resonating throughout); the destruction of the family by the patriotic need to go to war; the trauma of a single mother in a culture that demeans them.  <p>There is a strange disjunction between the very Victorian atmosphere, with its lack of modern technology, its outmoded clothes, its formal way of speech, its obsessions with ghosts and cemetaries, its gruesome photo albums of the dead (which, it was hoped, would keep alive the deceased spirit) and the nominal setting, 1945, which, though an age away, seems so much more familiar and modern to us.</p></body></html>

But it does have its flaws. First off, Tracy is a little strange from the git-go. "Nough said without giving away anything. Second, while I totally understood the ending (yes, every aspect of it), it just wasn't fulfilling. Not in any way. The viewer feels cheated, not completed. This is a major problem with Seven and what holds it back from being a Silence-type classic. There's such a thing as being too artistic.</p></body></html>

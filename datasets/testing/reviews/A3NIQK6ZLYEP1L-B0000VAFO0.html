<meta name="summary" content="Good movie but..."></head><body><p>One, I enjoyed the movie.  Gun battles, great special effects, and the lovely Kate Beckinsale.  I liked how the movie makers tried to keep humans in all the scenes and didn't use computer graphics for everything.  Being a fan of Whitewolf I enjoyed parts of the movie and can understand why they sued Sony.<br />But I think they failed in some parts - I would have liked to see vampires fighting fang and claw against the weres a couple of times.  Also, Kate's beauty was under used - she only wore two outfits during the whole movie.  While Sophia Myles, who was Erika, got to show off her beauty with multi-outfits and even got to show off her pretty fangs while on a ceiling.<br />We never learned much about the history of either sides, only in where it was needed to support the plot.  Frankly, while I like Goth, and found many of the backgrounds interesting, I think some vampires would be more colorful.  You're dead - you might as well enjoy it.  What about body art, nose rings and clown outfits?  And why are weres always in sewers or run-down ruins?  They seem to live just as long - don't they have bank accounts?<br />The commentary was perfect and the extras were great, but I fear the movie missed the true greatness it could have reached.</p></body></html>

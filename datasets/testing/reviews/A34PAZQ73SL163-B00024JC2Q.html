Owen Wilson is hilarious as a corrupt but somehow decent cop.  He has some great lines like...let's float this dead body down to another precinct. Vince Vaughn has to be one of the most entertaining actors out there as it's impossible to take your eyes of him.  Snoop is perfect for his role as he knows some people who know some people who steal. Will Ferrell plays a pervert extremely well, which isn't a big shock, and the whole thing has a real upbeat vibe.  It's happy entertainment.</p></body></html>

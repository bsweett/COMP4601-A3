Look inside the mind of a serial killer, with non-stop suspense - and you have one hell of a film.  Too frightening to watch on your own, this film boasts not only a well structured script, but fine performances all round.  <p>Jodie Foster stars as Agent Starling who &quot;consults&quot; with Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) to work out the identity of a serial killer.  This is Jodie's finest film, and one which you will return to time and time again.<p>DVD SUMMARY:  Released now for the third time on DVD, after two attempts, which featured non-anamorphic transfers.  The latest edition features a 5.1 remix and a beautiful anamorphic transfer.  Missing however is the famed audio commentary from Foster which was one of the earlier DVD's.  Oneday we will get  a DELUXE version hopefully.</p></body></html>

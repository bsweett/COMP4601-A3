<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Fun in John Malkovich's Head"></head><body><p>This movie is different from any other movie ever made.  It is a fun trip that raises many thoughtful questions.  WARNING:  DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU SUFFER FROM PARANOID DELUSIONS OR SUBSCRIBE TO MATRIX-TYPE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  It will send you over the edge.  The basic story is that down-on-his-luck wanna be puppeteer John Cusack reluctantly gets a day job at the gentle urging of his frumpy wife (yes they make her a frump) Cameron Diaz.  This day job changes both their lives as Cusack discovers a portal that leads to John Malkovich's head.  Nothing and no one is what they seem, and it is very hard to see who is controlling who, even at the very end.  <p>I can't imagine John Malkovich's face when he was approached with this screenplay.  I can't believe anyone in his right mind wouldn't run the other way when presented with even the most basic premise for this film.  But then again, at least in the movie, Malkovich is anything but in his right mind.  Heck, for most of the film, he isn't even IN his mind.  Creepy, huh?  Creepy doesn't even begin to cover it.  But I highly recommend it.  Just be warned not to drive or operate heavy machinery after seeing it. <p>This movie is best watched late at night.  Most of the scenes are in fact shot at nighttime, adding positively to the surreal effect of the story.  Cusack, Diaz, and Malkovich turn in wonderful performances.  Catherine Keener is suitably hateable as the selfish Maxine. <p>This movie encourages you to look deep beneath the surface of a person.  It is also good for some serious out-loud laughs.</p></body></html>

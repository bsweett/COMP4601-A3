I got 5 really big laughs out of it, and they all involved the scenes I saw in the commercials. Cohen is pretty much wasted here, and the whole middle of the movie seemed like they ran out of ideas. Will is a funny guy, and has his moments here. But after seeing him be funnier in many other movies(not to mention the re-runs of SNL), I can't help wonder what would have happened had they spent a little more time on the script...and come up with more ideas worthy of all this talent.</p></body></html>

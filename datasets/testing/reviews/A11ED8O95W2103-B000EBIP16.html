I don't know how this could have been done better without making it a much longer movie.<br /><br />Here's all the stuff I loved about this movie:<br /><br />It drew me right in from the beginning in a way I didn't expect.<br /><br />The children were very believable to me.  They acted just as school children of that time period would act, at least to me anyway.<br /><br />Soundtrack that fit perfectly and complimented the story while not overwhelming the visuals and the acting.<br /><br />I really believed those animals were talking!  Surely some breakthroughs were made in CGI.  The voices cast were appropriate for each of the animals.<br /><br />Battle scenes with intensity but not gore.<br /><br />An epic story of betrayal and redemption that one doesn't necessarily need to be a Christian to enjoy.<br /><br />I'll want to watch it through with the commentary tracks someday too.  Here's hoping for sequels!</p></body></html>

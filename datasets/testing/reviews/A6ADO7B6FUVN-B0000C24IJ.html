<meta name="summary" content="A Gory Nightmare..."></head><body><p>Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington), a recent graduate from Medical School, is on his way to a interview when he is held back in traffic by an accident.  Consequently, he turns back in order to find a detour to his interview, and on his merry way through the back roads of West Virginia he gets into a car accident with a group of five preppy college students.  Chris and three of his newly gained friends begin to hike to a location where they can find a phone, since their cellular phone won't work.  However, something malevolent is lurking in the woods around them that has been brought about through decades of inbreeding.  Chris and his friends realize that they have been thrown into a hellish nightmare where death seems to be the only way out.  Wrong Turn is a gory throwback horror film that offers several gruesome shots that can be compared to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the recent House of 1000 Corpses.  However, this film does not offer much more than deaths of the characters through the actions of some grotesque evil inbreds.  Overall, it is a gory film, but it is not sufficient for a good scary cinematic experience</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kingdom of Heaven"></head><body><p>`Kingdom of Heaven' is an epic tale set during the Crusades and whilst this is rife with historical inaccuracies, it is also a fairly decent story of one man finding some peace and meaning in his life. Bloom plays the main character (Balian) and he manages to play the role reasonably well, although he doesn't seem to have enough grit at times. He puts on a brave show with his sword fights and gives the occasional rabble rousing speech now and again, but he is no William Wallace crying for `Freedom' although you get the feeling this was the image Scott was going for. This is based around the death of a king, his succession and the fall of Jerusalem and this could have lead to deep courtly intrigue and Machiavellian schemes to enhance the plot and though these elements are represented in the film, they are rather flat and without suspense. I think this stems from the fact that this is overlong (don`t be fooled by the time guide on Amazon), I have bought the directors cut of this and boy does it feel overlong by the end. This doesn't seem to have much pace, but plods on and on, when in reality it could be a snappy story full of chivalry, battles and honour. For all that, this is still a perfectly enjoyable film and once you settle into it's rhythm you can truly appreciate it for it's epic scope.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

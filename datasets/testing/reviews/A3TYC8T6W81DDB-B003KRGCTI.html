The first few trailers and TV spots were interesting as they completely avoided spoilers relating to the film. More recent TV spots, ones that were being shown as recent as yesterday, pretty much spoil what the book actually is. You may have already been able to guess what particular book it is, but seeing everything unfold without any expectations or predictions is the best way to see the film. The Book of Eli seemed to be going in a direction that was predictable at times, but then went down an unexpected detour to end up at a completely separate destination. Without spoiling too much, the events that are revealed in the finale of the film make the entire experience worthwhile. What transpires in the last twenty minutes or so pretty much makes you want to watch the film again and solidifies the Eli character as a vagabond of the most ultimate caliber.<br /><br />Denzel Washington's portrayal of a man who's gotten so caught up in the mission that's been given to him that he's forgotten how it feels to interact with genuine people is nearly flawless. Well, that and the action scenes he's a part of are spectacular and incredibly exciting to watch. The rather underrated Gary Oldman does a fantastic job of making you hate his character, as well. Carnegie is so smarmy and selfish that you nearly jump for joy once the empire he's built begins to crumble. It was surprising, in a good way, to see Malcolm McDowell have a small part in the film. Although his character doesn't have much screen time, he still made a small impact. Tom Waits as the Engineer managed to have a few great scenes with Denzel Washington, as well. Mila Kunis didn't really offer anything new as far as her acting goes, but she fit the Solara role pretty well. Jennifer Beals seemed to be the weak link in the cast though. She has a scene with Gary Oldman where she begins to break down and start crying that just didn't feel up to par with the rest of the cast, but that could be classified as a nitpick.<br /><br />The Book of Eli is a great way to start the new year with a bang as far as moviegoing experiences go. The film's storyline is a bit reminiscent of films like Fahrenheit 451 and Equilibrium since all three films deal with book burning in a not too distant future. There's actually one scene near the end of the film where Eli and Solara are in a boat that brought Children of Men to mind, a trait that is purely meant as a compliment. The Book of Eli delivers a highly entertaining ride from beginning to end composed of strong performances from the cast, an enticing story, and a blindsided ending. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

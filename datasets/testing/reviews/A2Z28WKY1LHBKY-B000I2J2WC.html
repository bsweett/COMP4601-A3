I haven't; but I've read The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, by Earl Teabag, so I had some idea what to expect. It didn't help much in following the track of puzzles, none of which seemed to be properly solved. After about 10 minutes the movie lost me, but I didn't mind watching it to the end. I'd given up long before, so nothing much mattered. There were interesting parts: I thought the brisk analysis of the geometry underlying Leonardo's Last Supper was interesting. This is certainly one of the world's most fascinating paintings. Audrey is a sweetie, and I thought she was OK. The men weren't that impressive, although the blue-eyed albino had a bit of presence: couldn't figure out what he was doing in the story, sadly. The others might have been better if they'd had better parts to play, with better dialogue. They seemed dazed most of the time, just like me. As for the story: well, Leigh Baigent's ideas are quite interesting to read, but they don't convince and don't add up to much, like everybody says. The producers must have been delighted by the bans on religious grounds, here and there. Christ's basic principles (if he ever existed) boil down to love your neighbour and turn the other cheek. Can't say, considering its history, the Catholic church has applied them to any great extent. Nor have many other religions, for that matter, though there may be one or two exceptions. Too concerned with enforcing their beliefs on others, and being boss. Unfortunately Christ's ideas may be OK in theory, but the first one is very often almost impossible to implement, and the second simply doesn't work in practice. Might as well put your head in a noose. Ah well, Audrey is welcome to call me, and give the theories a try.</p></body></html>

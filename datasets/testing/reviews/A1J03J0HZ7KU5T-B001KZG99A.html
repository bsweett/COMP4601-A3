<meta name="summary" content="Downey's Superhero Triumph"></head><body><p>Director Jon Favreau's "Iron Man" may lack the epic stature of "The Dark Knight," but it's more entertaining. Thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s inspired brilliance, this Marvel adaptation captures the fun and wonderment missing in the "Spider-Man" franchise. Favreau maintains the ideal balance of humor and action without resorting to CGI overkill. Downey  receives excellent support from Gwyneth Paltrow and classic villainy from Jeff Bridges. "Iron Man" is the rare comic-book movie that transcends its source material.</p></body></html>

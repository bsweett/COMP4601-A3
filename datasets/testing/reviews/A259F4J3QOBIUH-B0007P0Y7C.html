<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing, but worth watching.  The cover is really cool."></head><body><p>Ok, although I worked in a movie store, and I am usually a good judge of films (thus no need to review movies less than 3 stars, generally)...I bought it for the cover and a few previews.<br /><br />I thought that this movie would be an intense, butt kicking, action packed film with a hot chic superhero cutting her way through obstacles.  This movie has not left as strong of an impression in my mind, as most films do.  I only vaguely recall the plot and some rather boring scenes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the actress is hot, and she does a little butt kicking, but if you want action I'd recommend movies with Milla Jovovich, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGGE68">Ultraviolet (Unrated, Extended Cut)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPUFAQ">Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray</a>], etc., or Kate Beckinsale; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ80I">Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6IOC0">Underworld - Evolution (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, and obscure flicks such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQ5V8G">Bloodrayne (Unrated Director's Cut)(DVD ROM game is included)</a>.<br /><br />Elektra was not very electrifying. I give it a "watch it once" rating, but I was not very impressed with the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the book"></head><body><p>I saw "The Prestige" last night, having already read the book. Although, I already knew the details of the plot, that it was the story of two rival magicians in 19th Century London, and the secrets of each of their magic tricks, I still found this film to be well worth watching. In fact, I found the film to be an improvement on the book, as the film leaves the main plot twists to the final scene, whereas the book reveals them earlier.<br /><br />Although, I am not a big fan of Christopher Nolan (I hated what he did to "Insomnia"), I think he did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. It is well paced and although Nolan reveals enough to solve the riddles of the film, nothing is blatently obvious. As usual, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Cain also turn in excellent performances (when I read the book, I wondered if Nolan had been correct to cast Bale as Bowden and Jackman as Angier - I thought it might have been better the other way around - but after seeing the film, I think he got it right).<br /><br />This movie is well worth watching, and if you haven't read the book, it is probably worth watching twice, just to see what you missed the first time around.</p></body></html>

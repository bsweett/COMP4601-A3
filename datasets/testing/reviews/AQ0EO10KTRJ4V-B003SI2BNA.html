<meta name="summary" content="Atmosphere without Substance"></head><body><p>Jennifer Connelly does an exceptional acting job in this film that creates a dark wet soggy atmosphere for 100 minutes, but never develops any substance.<br /><br />The film seems like a study in using atmosphere to set a mood but little more.<br /><br />Does anybody else notice that RING, RING 2, GRUDGE and now DARK WATER are all the same story slightly rehashed and done over and over again ?<br /><br />Amazing they have been able to make money by making the exact same movie 4 times from the same basic story (ie... lost or neglected kid and water coming from beyond the grave)<br /><br />This was hard to take serious with nothing but drips, water leaks and geysers for 90 minutes...... and of course it was not helped any with the ending kind of given away in the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />HINT..... as mentioned above, this is a quick rehash of Ring and Grudge, etc...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Your Father's Superhero Movie"></head><body><p>I could start out with the line from Dave Mason's classic song:  "There are no good guys, there are no bad guys, there's only you and me and we just disagree."<br /><br />Most superhero movies deal with people who are basically moral and upright, where the villains are usually evil, and where the focus is on PG-13 rated action.  This movie blurs the distinction between good and evil, where the heroes are no less violent (and in some cases no less murderous) than the villains.  The result in fairly nihlistic, that there is really no meaning to everything.  In another sense, it is existential, where we create our own meaning.<br /><br />I am giving this five stars.  Why?  Because it is a well crafted story.  It gives you opportunity to know the characters psychologically rather than the typical two dimensional stereotypes where the emphasis is on the action instead of on the person.  (The recent Batman series comes closest to this, with honorable mention to the X-Men Trilogy.)  It is a long movie, but that's because it doesn't rush the story.<br /><br />There were many reasons I could have given it a lower rating.  Some are purely subjective, such as the dark and bleak outlook of the movie.  Some are due to feeling this being an R-Rated movie with a lot of vile language, too graphic violence, and going all out on the nude scene with Night Owl II and Silk Spectre II-- a lot of that seeming gratituous.<br /><br />This is, as just said, an R-Rated movie.  Teenagers don't need to see this movie.  Personally, I think they don't need to be exposed to that hopeless a philosophy any more than to the sex and violence.  In other words, I long for the days of the Batman TV series.  But maybe Silk Spectre I was right -- the future looks darker and the past looks brighter.  I just would like to do more to brighten the future.</p></body></html>

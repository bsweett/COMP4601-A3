<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest Horror Films ever."></head><body><p>Dario Argento clearly originates from the Hitchcockian school of suspense. In typical Argento fashion the characters and plot are all but ignored in his effort but it seems difficult to imagine why his films seem of such high quality. There is not a better director with regards to camera angles and lighting that I have ever seen, it is no wonder he writes all of his own screenplays. His films do not need dialogue or deep character development because it simply isn't what he sets out to do. Argento intrigues you and allows you to trust a film and then is willing to completely shift it's direction just to scare you. The plush colors and impossible camera angles that consistently make you wonder how the hell he got up there to get that incredible shot are what make Argento's films great and clearly his own.<p>Susperia is Argento's masterwork. Albeit, Tenabrae and Inferno are also both done very well, this is one of the greatest horror films ever made and not enough people have seen it. Argento's style is accentuated in this film and he is free to do whatever he wants visually because of the broad script he works with here. The film is like any nightmare you have had that sticks with you for most of the day. I have no question that may be where Argento gets some of his bizarre ideas. The beginning of the film simply shows a girl walking through a thunder shower and the way the scene is filmed and the music is placed makes you realize just how good Argento is at creating suspense in a scene that would normally be filmed with far less attention. Another thing that makes Susperia a great horror movie is the soundtrack, a soundtrack in which I would argue is more frightening than both Halloween and The Omen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great horror (there are few great films in that genre), although Argento's style is often difficult to appreciate at first to those accustomed to conventional film work.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Good Beginning"></head><body><p>World`s favorite mutants get their first movie and the result is convincing enough to deserve a watch. Bryan Singer, a repectable and innovative director ("The Usual Suspects", "Apt Pupil") shows enough respect and knowledge about the franchise and creates an entertaining and meaningful action movie, wich steps above many run-of-the-mill empty blockbusters with repeated ideas. The director expertly showcases the X-Universe, setting the mood and tone for the sequels to come.<br />Although this is sci-fi material, in a way it`s depicted in a realistic, believable manner, as the characters and their envoironment seem credible and not too fantasy-like creations. Singer developed a serious tone for this universe, avoiding the childish and irritating tendencies of the latter Batman movies. The plot focuses mainly on Wolverine and Rogue, so unfortunately the rest of the characters aren`t too developed, but given that this is the first movie of a series it works well enough. <p>"X-Men" is intelligent, creative sci-fi, a solid movie with good direction, competent special effect (used just when necessary, avoiding useless explosions and fights), an efficient plot and a talented cast. Not a masterpiece, just a good comic-book adaptation (in fact, it`s probably one of the best).<br />The ending result should please fans and non-fans alike, altough it would be surpassed by its sequel, "X2", a better and more sucessful movie. Worthwile entertainment (and though-provoking, too).</p></body></html>

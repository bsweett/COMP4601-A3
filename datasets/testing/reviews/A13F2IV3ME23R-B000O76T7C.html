<meta name="summary" content="ALWAYS ENTERTAINING - NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES SEEN"></head><body><p>I have always enjoyed futuristic Sci-Fi - Do not really remember if it appeared in comic form.<br /><br />Have yet to look at disc 2 -- have thoroughly enjoyed the actors concept of their characters - it is very hard to describe the feelings invocked upon seeing that ugly old Alien Queen - the nasty Company that wanted the Alien alive - no matter who has to die in the meantime.<br /><br />Oh Yeah! those guys were in for the fight of their lives. And the danger even came from one of their own.  A Company man. And a synthetic person.<br /><br />Has become a classic and well worth adding to your collection - for pure entertainment.  This is one to get without believing anyone's comments, good or bad.  It is a matter of taste.<br />Great characters - great action - Nasty determined enemy - dark and dangerous - great cat.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- Not good for anyone prone to nightmares.</p></body></html>

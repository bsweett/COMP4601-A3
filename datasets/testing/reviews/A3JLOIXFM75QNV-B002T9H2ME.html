It is exactly what you thought it would be-the surprise is very minimal. That said, I still enjoyed watching this film, if only for Sam Rockwell who does a wonderful job as pretty much the only actor on screen. He is very believable and fun to watch. The only other 'character' is 'GERTY'-the main computer, voiced perfectly by Kevin Spacey. Usually, when dealing with an artificial inteligence in a film such as this, you are immediately suspicious and are left wondering what will happen. GERTY remained the only true mystery in this film for me.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film, just not as original as people hyped it out to be. It is extremely predictable, which is unfortunate because once you have it figured out, the rest of the film is not as mysterious for you. At least that was the case with me. Still, I have seen alot worse in regards to this genre.</p></body></html>

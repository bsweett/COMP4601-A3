<meta name="summary" content="Overrated, But the Performance is Great"></head><body><p>I wasn't surprised when Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar for this film, nor was I surprised when she actually won the Oscar. Her performance was clearly (from the previews) Oscar bait, but what did surprise me was the film gaining an Oscar nod for Best Picture. Even though it had a future Oscar winning performance, was directed by Stephen Frears (who directed one of my favorite films "Dangerous Liaisons), it didn't seem like it would be that good. Having now watched it, I still hold to the fact that it is not that good. The film has its merits and deserved its nomination for Best Original Screenplay, but Best Picture is stretching it quite a bit. I feel that "Notes on a Scandal" should've got the Oscar nomination spot that this film took. Anyway, Mirren plays Queen Elizabeth with Michael Sheen playing the recently appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not long after The Queen accepts Blair as Prime Minister, Diana Spencer the former Princess of Wales dies in a car crash with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed. The world, not just Britain, are shocked by the news of Diana's death and is even more shocked when The Queen and her staff virtually refuse to even acknowledge the death. As her popularity suddenly drops and The Queen struggles to rule her monarchy with dignity, Blair all but takes her place as the main character...Even giving Diana the nickname "the people's princess." Judging by the synopsis, it seems that the movie is an attack on The Queen...And for the first half of the movie, I was thinking that it was. It's not. It's a depiction of how The Queen struggled to rise above her own values and still please her people. I doubt this movie would have been as successful as it was, had it not been for Mirren because she's really the person that carries the film. In a movie that is filled with great performances, including from James Cromwell, Michael Sheen also turns in a winning performance. I'm surprised he wasn't able to score an Oscar nomination. "The Queen" is not a bad film, but I certainly wouldn't rank it as one of the top 10 best films of 2006. It is, however, a short and worth watching film with a terrific performance from its leading lady.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></body></html>

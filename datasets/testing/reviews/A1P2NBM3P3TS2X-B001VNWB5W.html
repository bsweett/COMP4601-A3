Each one of the movies arrived with slight-to-moderate damage to the Blu-ray case (amaray).<br /><br />The present version of the Blu-ray case is relatively flimsy compared to the standard DVD case.  I hope someone comes up with another, sturdier version.  Of course if you buy a Blu-ray at the store and take it home it probably won't suffer the same damage mine did.<br /><br />Amazon -- are you paying attention?<br /><br />I opened the BD case hoping to find a booklet that would list all the bonus content.  Nope.  There ain't one.  But there IS, however, an insert telling us that a 5-disc ultimate collector's edition of the movie is due out in December 2009.  The insert includes directions on how to get a $10 discount on the Ultimate set, but you have to join the studio's rewards program.  There's always a catch, isn't there?  Join the rewards program and they will email you the discount coupon/code a few weeks before the DVD street date.<br /><br />Interesting that this release of "Watchmen" is an extended cut and that there doesn't appear to be an option to watch the theatrical cut.  What if you are one of the folks that likes the theatrical cut better than the extended cut?  Are you just out of luck?  Will you have to purchase the Ultimate Collector's edition to see the theatrical cut (if it is even included)?<br /><br />We had the same problem with "Amadeus".  A Director's Cut was released on DVD and, later, Blu-ray that didn't include the option to see the original theatrical cut instead.  Personally I prefer the theatrical cut of that film.  Seems unfair that we grow to love a certain version of a film and then are asked to buy a DIFFERENT version of it if we want to have a copy to own.<br /><br />"Watchmen" is the same way.  It would have been nice to walk out of the theater knowing we could buy the movie we JUST SAW when it comes out on DVD, perhaps with the option of seeing additional footage too.  But no -- can't do that.<br /><br />It's like a meal at a restaurant where the dish is prepared one way for dine-in customers and a different way for take-out orders.  What if you want take-out but like the dine-in version better?  Sorry.  Too bad.<br /><br />The other issue is the sound mix.  If you play it at a level where you can comfortably hear the dialogue, the sound effects are deafening. Don't hand me the "if it's too loud, you're too old" argument, either.  That's for concerts, not home video.  It is especially noticeable in the opening scene.  I live in an apartment with reasonably thick walls, but I still have to play this BD at lower-than-normal volume and turn on the English subtitle track.  I want to enjoy it but I'm not going to force my neighbors to suffer through it.  There is such a thing as common courtesy (though it is in increasingly short supply).</p></body></html>

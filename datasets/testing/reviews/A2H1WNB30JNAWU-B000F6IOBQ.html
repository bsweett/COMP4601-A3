<meta name="summary" content="Good horror movie but..."></head><body><p>Underworld Evolution was a good horror movie but... I agree with some of the reviewers the story line was strange to say the least.  I enjoy the beginning of the movie, then slow up in middle, but I actually enjoy the ending personally.  So for this movie I have to say if your just looking for some mindless entertainment to have during a free evening then pick this movie up and enjoy some good amount of blood and gore, decent story line that sets up the 4th movie in the set Awakening.  But to me this is still a good movie worth 4 stars but falls into what I call love it or hate movies.</p></body></html>

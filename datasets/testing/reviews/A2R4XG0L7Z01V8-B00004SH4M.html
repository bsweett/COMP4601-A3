<meta name="summary" content="Saw a special 'digital' screening at the cinema"></head><body><p>I've only seen a couple of Bond movies. I certainly would not call myself a 'fan'! I've seen two Timothy Dalton movies, and of course, the recent Casino Royale. When asked if I wanted to go see a special 'digital' screening at the cinema, I thought "why not?" I haven't seen any Sean Connery Bond movies and a few people say he's the best Bond. My mum disagrees, she seems to have a thing for Roger Moore.<br /><br />I've never been so disappointed in a film before. For starters, the cinema was really hot, which severely affected my viewing. And I just didn't like Sean Connery. For me, he's definitely got better with age (Entrapment for example), but I just did not like him as Bond. Every line he said was absolutely DRIPPING with innuendo, normally ended with a wink or a smirk. And I mean dripping. It's called subtlety, and Timothy Dalton had some. And where is his Scottish? It sounded seriously toned down. He's sexy with a Scottish accent! Plus, I think I was coughing up furballs at the sight of his chest. It looks like a extremely furry animal died on it. Ugh! Can you guess I like no hair on my men?<br /><br />For me, Goldfinger was the longest (it felt that way!) and dullest Bond movie. After really liking Casino Royale, this was a major let down. There's nothing memorable about it, and for a film that had a budget bigger than the first two combined, Sean Connery doesn't set foot outside Pinewood Studios, even though Bond is shown in America etc, in the film. What did they spend the budget on? Nothing major that I could see. The only thing I really liked about Goldfinger, was the girl who was asphyxiated by being covered in gold paint. Such a good look, but an absolute pain to get off I bet! Her skin was probably red raw from scrubbing at it that much.<br /><br />I really didn't like Goldfinger. What am I not seeing? People seem to rave about it. I just don't see it. I'll stick to Daniel Craig in his blue shorts. Hairless. Sean Connery may be white haired and an old man, but he's good, just not as Bond I'm afraid.</p></body></html>

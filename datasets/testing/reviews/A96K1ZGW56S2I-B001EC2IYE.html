<meta name="summary" content="What's the Big Deal?"></head><body><p>MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a movie about an aging boxing trainer (Clint Eastwood) named Frankie Dunn who goes on a limb and against his instincts and begins training a late-twentysomething female boxer (Hillary Swank), named Maggie Fitzgerald, who has tons of raw talent, a lot of heart, and very little skill.  Under Frankie's tutelage, Maggie's raw talent is processed and refined and she quickly picks up the skills needed to be successful as a boxing champ.  She becomes the knockout queen, knocking her opponents out one after the other before the end of the first round.  After a championship fight in England and a European tour that still left her undefeated, Maggie comes back to the states as a member of a whole new level of play.  Agents across the country come crawling and the offers roll in.  Frankie knows Maggie is good, but he still believes in perseverance and patience and wants to keep her from fighting for the world championship until she gets a couple more fights under her belt. But, Maggie is his Million Dollar Baby and his surrogate daughter and Frankie can't deny her anything. So it's off to Las Vegas to fight the world champion, Billie "The Blue Bear".  That fight changes everything and the backdrop of boxing fades away as the lives of the characters begin a journey down a less-traveled path.<br /><br />The best thing about MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the acting. Morgan Freeman plays a supporting role as Eddie Dupris and lends his voice as the film's narrator. Freeman is a master of underplay and makes the most simple and mudane scenes and lines full of power and emotion just by a simple facial gesture or change in tone of voice.  His 2005 Best Supporting Actor win was well deserved and long overdue.<br /><br />Hillary Swank does a remarkable job portraying Maggie Fitzgerald and went through a great deal of training and conditioning to tone her body for the role. Her performance in the first 2/3rds of the film is amazing.  However, though she is believable in the last 1/3rd of the movie, she really didn't do much acting (it's rather easy to let your limbs go limp).  Her performance garnered another Best Actress win, but one that might not have been deserved as voters were taken back more by emotion than actual performance.<br /><br />With MILLION DOLLAR BABY Clint Eastwood has now officially directed about half the number of films he has acted in and about half of those are pictures he acted in as well.  Eastwood did a brilliant job of directing by melding three top-notch acting performances together so they feel as though they are one whole. He was able to do this despite a several cliches in the plot, a few cheesy lines, a limited budget, and three strong performers.  As much as I would like to see Martin Scorsese win a Best Director Oscar before he dies, Eastwood's direction was better and MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a slightly better picture than THE AVIATOR because it flows together much more smoothly whereas THE AVIATOR (despite all its brilliance and bringing a long-gone era back to life) is long and somewhat choppy.<br /><br />However, as far as movies go, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is really just an average flick.  Sure it has some great performances, direction, lighting, even some occasional witty banter.  But all of that without a great story does not make a great movie.  There are moments in the movie that are touching, especially with the relationships between the three main characters. But much of the "emotion" surrounding the movie is simply hype having to deal with the controversial subject that the film deals with in the last act. Unlike some, I did find the accident to be believable.  My problem is that the way the controversial subject is handled failed to move me in any direction. The film's solution did not anger me to protest nor did it make me want to "switch sides" and become a Kevorkian sympathizer because I "understand" now. In fact, the way the movie handles the whole situation left me rather indifferent and apathetic. A great movie doesn't do that.<br /><br />Besides the "controversial subject" the movie deals with, the picture also points a negative picture of family and religious leaders. There are people in the world like Maggie's family. However, that combined with the fact that Frankie's daughter is the one who refuses to reconciliate leaves a complete negative picture of familial relationships.  Then there is the mockery of religion.  The priest of the church that Frankie attends is uncaring, aloft, unsympathetic, and unnloving. He treats Frankie with disdain and loathing instead of compassion and empathy. I'm sure that there are religious leaders like that in the world, but not many. I just found it disheartening that once again the only religious leader of a Hollywood picture was portrayed in a negative light instead of a positive one.<br /><br />MILLION DOLLAR BABY is worth seeing for the fine acting performances, but as far as movies go in general, it's just about average and really shouldn't have won BEST PICTURE (the movie that should have won wasn't even nominated).</p></body></html>

But i will tell you one thing about the second part coming out its called devils rejects . I saw a 10 minute clip and it looked stuppid as hell. Nothing like the original.It went from a horror to an action flcik in the 2nd part they show them having some stupid shoot out with cops. I dont just lloked more like an action flick. This is going to be like the hills have eyes the first one was great the second one was complete crap. Some times certain movies dont need sequels. Though this opinion is early , i will still go see the devils rejects cause you never know my opinion might change.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Christmas Story Is PERFECT"></head><body><p>I LOVE this Christmas movie and in my opinon it's probably one of the best movies ever made in the United States. Based upon the life and real-true story of Jean Shepard the movie takes place when a young boy Ralphie wants a coveted Red Ryder B.B. gun but his mother tells him "no you'll shoot your eye out." So, all his Christmas hopes are dashed... but, not giving up Ralphie deals with some hillarous incidents in dealings with bullies, teachers, and even a store Santa to get the toy of his dreams.<br /><br />This will remain to be a classic in American homes for generations to come. Kids will love the movie for they can relate to that "gotta have toy" feeling and adults will remember what it was like- to be a child around Christmas or what their FAVORITE Christmas was like.<br /><br />Written very well this smart witted comedy gets laughs no matter how many times you watch it. Jean Sheppard's voiceovers as the Older Ralphie fit in perfectly with the younger Ralphie's antics.<br /><br />This movie will bring a smile to any kid or adults face and is the perfect Christmas present or DVD to watch around Christmas.

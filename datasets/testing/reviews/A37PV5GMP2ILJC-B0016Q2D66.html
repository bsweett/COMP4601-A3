April (Kate Winslet) marries Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), has two kids and lives on Revolutionary Road<br />2. April's unhappy<br />3. Frank's unhappy<br />4. April and Frank make me unhappy<br />5. They dream of Paris in the springtime which is supposed to be the winter of their discontent<br />6. Summer lovin' changes lots of things<br />7. It takes a patient of a mental institution to wake them up, and the audience with them<br />8. It seems they were never special or destined for anything at all<br /><br />Yeah, I know - it's a drama - but one would have hoped for a little more life, or at least believability in this drawn out saga about unhappy people behaving badly.  DiCaprio is terribly miscast for this role, his baby-faced good looks making him appear far too young, bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a middle aged man with the world on his shoulders.<br /><br />Winslet, on the other hand, is perfectly cast, and totally aces her part.  Unfortunately, the character is too unlikeable, and draws little or no sympathy from the audience.<br /><br />Supporting roles are played by Kathy Bates, Richard Easton and Michael Shannon as a dysfunctional family group, and by Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour as a friendly couple.<br /><br />Far from being King of the World, this monotonous melodrama posing as a Titanic reunion should have gone down with the ship.  Points are given for the acting, the sets and the costumes, with a bonus for Winslet, who gives the only performance worth the ticket price.<br /><br />John Givings: "Hopeless emptiness. Now you've said it. Plenty of people are onto the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 27, 2009</p></body></html>

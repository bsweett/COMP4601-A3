It is worth seeing, maybe once at best.<br /><br />Anna (Julia Roberts) is a married photographer who meets her husband, Larry (Clive Owen) through a twist of fate porno site set up. She crosses paths with a writer, Dan (Jude Law) when she photographs him for his book cover but Dan is somehow involved with a young stripper/waitress (Natalie Portman). Inevitably when lies are told lives are fowled up and these characters really make a mess of things.<br /><br />With a great director like Mike Nichols at the helm of this movie one would think it would all work. However I felt it lacked depth of any kind. The characters are cruel and passionless despite being obsessed with sex 24 hours a day. Clive Owen is downright creepy in his role as a doctor who frequents porn sites for a thrill.....is he such a crappy doctor that he has that much time to kill? Julia Robert's character is more like his possession than a wife and her role seems to have no purpose whatsoever. It is never explained why a seemingly beautiful and successful woman would agree to marry a freak who believes he met her in a porno site chat room....any self-respecting woman would question that even if he were a doctor with a Mercedes! So there is definitely something deeper in there but it is never made clear and soon becomes absolutely frustrating. Jude Law's role is jealous and obsessive and would have made sense had he treated Portman's character with a bit more respect. And finally Portman is a bit over her naive head here pretending to be raw and racy while projecting far too much fear, she is a great actor but this role took something away from her.<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly where this film really fails, the writing, the directing or the subject matter. I think it would have worked had more attention been paid to the reasoning behind the flawed characters and their decision making processes. They should have stayed closer to a good psychiatrist couch rather than their bedrooms if you ask me. This movie is so far from close it isn't even near!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An engrossing dark comedy"></head><body><p>Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Farris<br />Starring Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Steve Carell, Paul Dano, Toni Collette and Abigail Breslin<br />102 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br />Portuguese: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean, Thai<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine was nominated for four Oscars, with Alan Arkin winning for best supporting actor and Michael Arndt taking home the award for best original screenplay. Abigail Breslin was also nominated and the film was included in the best picture category.<br /><br />I listed so many of the cast because this dark comedy is filled with good performances.<br /><br />Olive Hoover (Breslin) qualifies for a beauty pageant which is set to take place 700 miles away. The family includes a heroin addict grandfather (Arkin), an aspiring motivational speaker father (Kinnear), a brother who has taken a vow of silence (Dano), a suicidal uncle (Carell) and a mother who tries to hold everything together (Collette).<br /><br />As several of the family members can't be trusted to survive alone, the entire family decides to make the trip in their old Volkswagen van.<br /><br />The comedy isn't dumb, despite the highly unlikely and sometimes unbelievable situations. The story is mainly driven by dialogue with the exception of a couple of situations.<br /><br />The conclusion shows what happens when they finally arrive in California for the pageant.<br /><br />It's R-rated for language, drug references and references to sex. Perhaps the most offensive thing was seeing how little girls are presented as women in the pageant. It's just a grotesque world.<br /><br />It's not easy to make me laugh and I am typically wary of any movie involving Carell, but this style of humor worked for me. Nobody put in a bad performance and I did laugh out loud a couple of times. I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />The presentation was excellent for such a low budget movie. Picture quality was good throughout and deserves a 4.5/5. Audio did the job and dialogue was clear (4/5).<br /><br />I would recommend this intelligent comedy to anyone who doesn't need to be bullied into laughter with slapstick.<br /><br />This is the type of story that has plenty of replay value as it will be fun to revisit these people and spend a while in their dysfunctional lives. For those wondering whether it's worth upgrading to the Blu-ray, I heartily recommend this presentation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a dud ths one turned out to be, I was disappointed!"></head><body><p>I haven't read the comic book series this movie is based on but I sure hope it is better than this movie was.<br />If you remember the TV ads for it you've seen the best bits and that isn't much of an exaggeration. Sean Connery was good but most of the others were just sort of there to take up space.<br />The idea of taking characters from several works of 19th century fiction never really works very well and could often have been better developed. Tom Sawyer, U.S. Secret Service, how'd that happen?, we don't get a clue. Mina Harker, Vampire, widow of one of the men who fought Dracula, never a clue as to how she isn't evil or can survive in sunlight, doesn't seem to need to feed very often either.<br />The best sets were the club/hotel(?)in Africa where Quatermain is recruited to the League and a couple of libraries in London, all either blown or shot up. Nemo's submarine looked as big as an aircraft carrier in some ways but also like it was razor thin, certainly bigger on the inside than the outside.<br />I kind of liked  the tank raid evil whatever his name was did on the Bank of England, a bit ahead of it's time but mostly looked OK. Nemo's 1930's style car was really pushing things for 1899, too much for me as what cars there were looked like (and were)horseless carriages. One of the most ridiculous bits was the League's journey from London to Venice. First you have this huge razor thin submarine rising up in the Thames (which is probably too shallow for anything so big) and then they make it to Venice in only three days! Around southern England then France aand Spain and through the Straits of Gibraltar alone would take more time than that even today even without travelling halfway across the Mediterranean Sea.<br />Sean Connery did well but I certainly won't be buying it, the rest of the movie is a mess.</p></body></html>

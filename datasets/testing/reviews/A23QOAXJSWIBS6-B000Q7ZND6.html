<meta name="summary" content="Good concept, suffers from Keanu-itis"></head><body><p>There was a lot to like in "Constantine."  I'll leave aside the jumbled theology and event-driven plot.  My feeling is the film was mis-cast from the beginning with Keanu Reeves in a suit.  Can we all say "NEO!" in unison?<br /><br />The special effects were great, but nothing ground-breaking.  The story-line was good, but not revolutionary.  I have not read the graphic-novel, but I have been told that there were significant changes to characters on the whole.<br /><br />It is not a terrible film, but I'm convinced that it would have been a substantially better film if it had been Jude Law or Chris O'Donnell in that suit instead of Keanu.</p></body></html>

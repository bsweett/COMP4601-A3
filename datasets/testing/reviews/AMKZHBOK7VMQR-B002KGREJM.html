<meta name="summary" content="Forest Whittaker in a career defining role as Idi Amin"></head><body><p>Whittaker is amazing in his frightful portrayal of Amin as an insecure man who gradually turns into a monster as the power he wields over his poor country leads to excessive violence. Whittaker should get instant Oscar consideration for his absolutely convincing depiction of Amin. The supporting cast is excellent but Whittaker dominates every scene hes in.<br /><br />The film recaptures the horror of Uganda under Amin and personalizes the story as we see him through the eyes of a Scottish Doctor who goes to Africa to work in a clinic and is caught up in events and accepts the job of Amin's personal physician. Through his eyes we gradually see his innocence melt away as he grows in awareness of what is really happening in the country. James MacAvoy os wonderful as the Doctor.</p></body></html>

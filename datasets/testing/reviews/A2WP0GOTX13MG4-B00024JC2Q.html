Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson, a.k.a. &quot;Hutch.&quot; Both characters are police officers in Bay City. Starsky is a &quot;by the book&quot; officer, while Hutch is laid back officer willing to bend the rules.<br /><br /> Joining Wilson and Stiller are Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear and Vince Vaughn as Reese Feldman, the movie's villain. Huggy Bear is a pimp character of sorts, and a friend of Hutch. Feldman is a cocaine dealer plotting to distribute millions of dollars of cocaine that has been engineered to be undetectable.<br /><br /> The characters and actors are what make this movie watchable. Wilson and Stiller have teamed up on other projects, and they always play well together. Stiller's performance can be somewhat forced, but his best scenes come when his character is undercover. Wilson plays a character that is similar to most of the characters he plays in other movies: a laid back, 90's type of guy. Snoop was perfect as Huggy Bear, right down to the 70's style fur coats, cane, and pimp attitude. Vaughn was remarkable as well.<br /><br /> Will Ferrell has a small role in the movie. It was a shame he wasn't used more. His casting was dead on for the role he played. His delivery and interation with Wilson and Stiller lead to one of the funnier scenes with a few funny follow up references later in the movie. There is also a cameo at the end of the movie by a couple of other actors. I won't name them so as to not spoil the surprise. The cameo seemed a bit forced and a bit long. If it had been a bit shorter and tighter, it could have been funnier.<br /><br /> Where the movie loses points is in the delivery of the jokes. At times, the movie plodded along, and some of the jokes were either forced, or took to long to set up and didn't deliver enough of a laugh as a payoff. There is a great scene at the beginning of the movie where one of Huggy's henchmen recites facts about everything in the middle of stand off with Starsky like he is World Book Encyclopedia. This scene worked, but unfortunately, it wasn't followed up on well.<br /><br /> There are several DVD extras, but none of them are extraordinary. The gag reel largely features scenes that got flubbed because the actors couldn't stop giggling through their lines. The deleted scenes only would have helped the story minimally, and it was easy to see why they were deleted. There is a featurette, in which the actors pretend to have hated working with each other and the director. It is funny because it is obvious they don't mean what they say, but after a few minutes, the joke just seems cruel, especially while the director says such admirable things about the cast.<br /><br /> This movie is fun, and definitely worth a rental. I haven't seen much of the 70's TV show to make a decent comparison. This is a movie that you can watch while you do something else, and you won't miss a whole lot. I wanted to give it four stars, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it enough to give that rating.</p></body></html>

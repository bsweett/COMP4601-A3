<meta name="summary" content="Clone Wars"></head><body><p>There has been a catastrophe; the entire planet has been contaminated and is virtually unlivable.  Survivors of the disaster must remain inside an enormous compound if they hope to live.  The situation could be worse, though.  The compound is very beautiful (if monochomatic), and every luxury is available to them.  Swimming pools, exercise rooms, computers, even fresh food.  What's more, the surviors have hope.  There exists an island which is the only place on Earth that hasn't been contaminated, and the people live in the hopes that soon, they will win the lottery and will be moved to the paradise.  For a post-apoctalyptic society, things aren't so bad.  Or are they...<br /><br />Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) begins to question things when he starts having "dreams" that suggest everything isn't exactly as it seems.  Along with his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), they escape from the compound only to learn that not only is the world still in perfect condition, but they are clones of rich people on the outside.  People like Tom Lincoln (McGregor) and Sarah Jordan (Johansson) paid to have themselves copied so that if they ever need an organ transplant, they will automatically have a perfect donor.  The clones are viewed as products, and instead of names, they have serial numbers.  Their names include the surname of their sponsors (Lincoln), their location code (6 means that Tom Lincoln lives in LA), and their generation (Echo refers to the year in which the clone was grown).<br /><br />Since this is a Michael Bay movie, one can expect there to be many explosions (and there are) as well as awesome special effects.  However, the story is just as compelling as the effects are cool.  Furthermore, the characters are fleshed out and multi-dimensional.  The movie's villain, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), who is the creator of the clone research facility, isn't an evil mastermind bent on torturing people.  He truly believes in what he is doing; he sees his job as helping people.  Granted, he refers to the clones, who are real people, as just soulles products.<br /><br />Another good thing about this movie is its charm.  The clones (or agnates as the Merrick company calls them) may have adult bodies, but they are mentally at the age of 15.  So when L6E and J2D encounter real people for the first time, the results are pretty funny (I love Johansson's bubbly delivery when some lowlife in a bar asks for her number, and she responds by saying "2 Delta").<br /><br />It is good to know that a summer blockbuster (especially one from Bay) can have heart behind it.  Hopefully, this film will set a precedent for future summer flicks.</p></body></html>

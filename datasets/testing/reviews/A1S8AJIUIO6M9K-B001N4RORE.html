<meta name="summary" content="Totally absorbing, uplifting, with a cast and staging that rocks"></head><body><p>I was astrongly encouraged to watch this movie, and having done so, am not sure if it was marriage counseling, a window into post-menopausal joy, a means of seeing into the hearts of the dedicated men and women of the intelligence community who choose to become "celibate chiefs" or "iron maidens" lamenting lost joys, or a mix of all three but I can testify as to its value in all three.<br /><br />Suffice to say that my 13 year old son nailed it when he heard I was going to watch it:  "Dad, you will love it or hate it."  Well, I loved it, and judging by the reviews there are a lot of folks who hate it, so mark me down as a strong five.<br /><br />This movie grabbed me so tightly I spent half the time standing five feet in front of the screen, not content to watch from across the family room.  It brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion, and most especially as it reached the cresendo of discovery and shared emotions among the three dads (one of whom emerges as the last man standing), the young couple, and the star of the movie, a vampish Meryl Streep whose eye make-up alone made her a completely different person, a truly remarkable touch of art.<br /><br />The two "mature" female supporting actresses were spectacular, and the young actress featured is going to be seen again.  Tom Hanks was involved in this movie as an executive producer, and overall, I could not find a single disappointment in this movie.<br /><br />The cheoreography and imagination--for example, all the men in the cast dancing down the pier in flippers--is great, and over-all this movie hangs together very well.<br /><br />The singing was fine and not the centerpiece for for one who loves musicial, more than enough to check that box--the producers do avery fine job of balancing actual singing "live" and studio singing overlain for the longer pieces.  The words mattered, and I can see how a cult might develop around this movie and the songs from the one group that is featured.  The scenery was spectacular and although not a central aspect of the script, breathtaking as a supporting element.<br /><br />Anyone that is a romantic and loves musical should buy this rather than renting--as some other reviewers have noted, this is one of those movies you can watch multiple times, always notice something new, and never tire of having it on.<br /><br />Other romance musicals that I have:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY">De-Lovely</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094ARN2">Beyond the Sea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094AS9U">Bride and Prejudice</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8QVWY">Walk the Line (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630522577X">My Fair Lady</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04OM">The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GBEWHA">Grease (Rockin' Rydell Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AM6IY">West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04NI">Oklahoma!

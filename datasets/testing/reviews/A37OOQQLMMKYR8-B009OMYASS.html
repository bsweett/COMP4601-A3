<meta name="summary" content="Despite what people say, Hostel was excellent"></head><body><p>Hostel is one of those movies that have sparked some huge debates. Some praise it as an instant classic and others deem nothing more than vile trash. Often referred to as torture porn, which is the silliest thing I have ever heard. Hostel is influenced by 70s exploitation movies. Right now Eli Roth is one of the most popular filmmakers. So when anybody gets as popular as Eli Roth has you know the backlash is coming.<br /><br />Roth has been hailed the next great horror filmmaker and even by some the savior of the genre. Eli Roth is only one person; he cannot save or hurt the horror genre on his own. There are many talented filmmakers who go unnoticed or struggle for work. Eli is one of the talented filmmakers who is having a career that is taking off and is possibly the most popular horror filmmaker out there right now. And due to that it's made him a sitting duck to be ripped a part.<br /><br />I respect everybody's opinion and I'm sure some people just don't like the work of Eli Roth and that's fine. The most loved of filmmakers will have people who dislike their work and the most hated of filmmakers will have people that like their work. But I do feel Eli Roth sometimes gets a little too much heat from fans and critics.<br /><br />When it comes to a movie like Hostel it's not gonna be for every horror fan, but what I loved about Hostel is Roth, is going back to the old school style of filmmaking and is one of the guys bringing back the long forgotten Grindhouse type flicks. People seem to forget there were movies like Hostel over the years, these types of movies started in the 60s, but the 70s is where these flicks will be remembered. The difference is, they weren't mainstream. They were popular at the Drive-Ins, but Hostel gained mass appeal. And it's been so long in some ways movies like Hostel are new since these movies haven't been done in so long and a lot of the core auidnce probably never saw the flicks that inspired Hostel.<br /><br />Over the last couple of years we have been stuck with lame PG-13 horror flicks and PC horror flicks. Eli Roth is a filmmaker that does his thing and doesn't let PC police sway him from getting his vision out. Right now in America the Liberal way of thinking is taking over. Sex and nudity is now a bad thing. Without sex none of us would even be here. Hostel has a lot of nudity and some sex scenes. Well since the 70s a lot of horror films have. Eli isn't the first person to use that in a horror film. Everything in this country has gotten so damn PC and sexually repressed.<br /><br />The lead characters is Hostel are young, single and on vacation am I supposed to believe that there is nobody out there like these characters? I don't get the big deal with the sex and nudity all of that is a common part of life and again plenty of horror filmmakers and filmmakers of any genre for that matter have used this in their movie, but now suddenly it's a bad thing.<br /><br />What I find rather funny is how many people bash the people who enjoyed Hostel as being sick and disturbed. I find that funny because many of these people also watch horror movies. What's the difference between what happens in Hostel and your run of the mill slasher movie? It's wrong to watch someone get tortured and killed, but ok to watch a slasher flick where people are hacked up? What's the difference? Murder is murder isn't it? Granted a movie like Hostel might be more extreme, but again murder is murder.<br /><br />The screenplay by Eli Roth is very solid; his characters aren't faceless and as thin as the paper they were written on. The characters come across as real people. I've known people who are a lot like the lead characters in Hostel. For me, one of the most important things in a horror flick is how I relate to the characters or if I can see myself being friends with them if this were real life. Eli Roth again created real characters. I'm not really like any of the characters in Hostel, but they weren't bad people. They were having their last moments of freedom before the real word kicks in when they head back home.<br /><br />The first on screen torture scene in Hostel doesn't come until the 40-minutue mark. Prior to that there are 2 deaths. One being off screen and the other as it begins there is a cut and we don't actually see anything, which makes the one we finally see a lot stronger. Unlike the slasher film, Eli Roth actually spends the first half of the movie developing the characters. In other horror movies the makers drop building up the characters and get right into the action and faceless characters.<br /><br />A lot of the people who bash Hostel are so off base; Roth could have taken the easy way out and jumped right into the action and made a movie with nothing, but gore and violence through out. But again the guy takes the time and develops the characters. And when the action starts we have come to know the characters and feel for them. Hostel isn't violence just for the sake of it. Never once does Eli Roth glorify the torture and murder scenes. I have seen plenty of movies where the filmmakers do that.<br /><br />As a director Eli Roth is showing a lot of promise. I don't wanna start a Cabin Fever/Hostel debate, but he really grew as a filmmaker in-between films. That's not to say Cabin Fever was bad. It was an enjoyable flick, but you can see how Roth grew as a filmmaker. The first half of Hostel was well done with the set up and the 2nd half has some great suspenseful and tension filled moments. The scene when Paxton is about to be tortured was classic.<br /><br />The whole 2nd half of Hostel was excellent; the comedy is toned down, which is a good thing. When it comes time to build suspense I hate when filmmakers have to throw in comedic moments. Often it's a tension breaker, but Roth pulls no punches and goes straight for the tension. While there is a scene or two with comedy the way it's done really adds to the movie. When you break it down there is a lot more to Hostel than people realize. The characters are well developed and there is some solid suspense in the 2nd half.<br /><br />People say Hostel isn't scary so it sucks. Unlike other type of horror films, movies like Hostel don't rely in the traditional way of scaring people. Picture yourself in another country, your friends disappear you are a stranger here, you can't' trust anyone. Or if anything picture yourself in another state. The scares aren't the typical boogeyman hiding in the shadows scare. The chance of something like Hostel actually happening is a good chance compared to the never ending run of slasher movies, which are pure fantasy.<br /><br />The acting was also quite solid; normally these types of movies feature weak acting, but Hostel had a solid cast and Jay Hernandez does a fantastic job at carrying the movie. His performance was real, he wasn't an actor he was the character of Paxton. The rest of the cast is solid, but Jay was the stand-out. Rick Hoffman though nearly steals the show in his brief scene.<br /><br />In closing, Hostel is a solid movie that is getting way too much heat. It's only a movie people. Eli Roth showed some great promise here and Hostel is one of the finest horror movies of the decade. I'll admit upon my first viewing I didn't quite like Hostel, but going back and watching it I realized how much more there was to Hostel than I first thought.</p></body></html>

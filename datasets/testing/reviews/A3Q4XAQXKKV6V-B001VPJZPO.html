<meta name="summary" content="HEY SCOOBY!"></head><body><p>You remember those cool old Scooby Doo cartoons where they introduce like 3 characters and from there you have to try and piece together who is behind it all? That's sort of how this movie feels, minus Scooby of course. That may seem like a slap but it isn't. It just has a tight (and generally good) cast which makes it so. The ending sort of feels like an old Twilight Zone; another plus.<br /><br />Throw in some pretty good camera work (the lock tumblers turning, love that stuff), a nice soundtrack, a generally untapped theme (hoodoo), a VERY GOOD HD DVD transfer and you almost have a four star movie, I'll compromise and say 3.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Thumbs Up - Mild Recommend.</p></body></html>

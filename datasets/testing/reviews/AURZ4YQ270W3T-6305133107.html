<meta name="summary" content="The quintessential Western"></head><body><p>One of the signs that a film is truly great is that it lives on, thematically, and visually, in films that follow. Judged by that standard, few films are greater than "The Searchers,"  pieces of some of the greatest films ever made have their genesis in this John Ford masterpiece.<br /><br />The scene in "Star Wars" where Luke Skywalker returns home to find his aunt and uncle dead? Yep, that's from "The searchers," right down to a windswept Luke looking briefly away when the enormity of what happened hits him.<br /><br />The opening shot, framed by a doorway opening into the desert vastness and a woman walking out of it, has been incorporated into dozens of films, the latest being "Kill Bill, Volume 2."<br /><br />The story of a sociopathic bigot trying to rescue a young girl trapped with a bunch of savages? Hey, wasn't that the basic plot of "Taxi Driver"?<br /><br />In addition to being a cinematic touchpiece for generations of filmmakers, "The Searchers" stands on its own as a truly great film experience, probably most notable for its stunning visuals, John Wayne's greatest performance, and a slightly more nuanced approach to the "cowboys and Indians" conflict that marked the coming of the revisionist Western.<br /><br />If nothing else, "The Searchers" is a gorgeous film to look at, with some of the most well-known visuals in film history. The most famous images, of course, are of the opening and closing "doorway" shots, but the desert scenes have enduring grace and power. If Wayne is the star of this film, the desert is his co-star.<br /><br />Wayne's complex, powerful portrayal of Ethan not only defined his career, but also helped define a new kind of character that would soon become known as an "antihero." Before long, the antihero would redefine cinema in films like "Bonnie and Clyde," "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," and even "Raiders of the Lost Ark."<br /><br />Much has been written about the attitude towards native Americans in "The Searchers," but this much is pretty clear: it's a whole lot more nuanced than the Westerns of its day. The famous climactic scene in which Wayne's character picks up his niece (who he'd vowed to kill because she was living with Cherokees) and takes her home seems to be an admittance that his bigotry is wrong. When the door literally closes on Wayne's character in the movie's legendary closing shot, the message is pretty clear: he might have done the right thing by bringing his niece home, but his attitudes are no longer acceptable, and he is denied redemption.<br /><br />That's a pretty powerful anti-bigotry message by 1956 standards, and like so much else in "The Searchers," it, too, lived on.</p></body></html>

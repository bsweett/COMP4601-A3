You know all the basics by now: it's marionettes, bumbling fighters for some kind of justice, and R-rated for - well, for lots of good reasons.<br /><br />It's also insanely funny. This is decidedly a product of Pres. Bush II, and generally lampoons the West Man's Burden that the US has taken on itself. It also ribs just about every stereotype around, using both its musical pieces ("Lonely" and "Montage" had me rolling) and its send-ups of dozens of other movies. Those included the original Thunderbirds TV show, Charlie's Angels, The Karate Kid, James Bond, The Matrix, and bunches of others. I couldn't always pick out a specific film being lampooned, but the mood was familiar and true whether or not I knew what it satirized.<br /><br />Two facts really stuck out in watching this. First was how well the puppets and scenes (wait for Il's panthers!) were put together. Second was that appreciation of the crude humor (gross-outs, homophobia, and all) split my viewing room down the middle, male vs. female. I spent a fair bit of time trying to explain why the country-western lyrics were so riotous. Have you ever tried to explain a joke? It was one of those, but bad.<br /><br />It's the best "adult" potty-humor animation since those scenes in Flesh Gordon. If you believe that even more time should have passed since then, skip Team America. If you're willing to sink to its level, though, it can be a lot of fun.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

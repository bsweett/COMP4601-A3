<meta name="summary" content="Great War Picture"></head><body><p>This gripping biography of one of the greatest generals in Wolrd War II grabs your attention from the opening pre-credits speech until the end of the film. George C. Scott gives his greatest performance, and is backed by Karl Malden (best known to TV audiences as starring in "The Streets Of San Francisco"). Despite a number of historical errors (Patton & General Bradley are portrayed as best friends whereas in real life, didn't care much for each other & Patton's best friend was General Eisenhower, etc) and the toning-down of Patton's actual phrases, this movie is nevertheless a stirring account of Patton in World War II. He had guts and a lot of balls. Rated PG.</p></body></html>

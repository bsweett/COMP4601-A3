<meta name="summary" content="Spooky"></head><body><p>THE OTHERS is a great, spooky film.  It does not try to be a slasher/scary film.  Instead, it is a classic (and classy) "haunted house" movie. THE OTHERS does more scaring with sound and implied camera angles than a slasher flick will ever do.  Its haunted house atmosphere (fog, creaky floors, old rooms) is spooky.  One effective scene involves a glowing, ghostly face that ends up being a painting.<p>The tone is set right away.  Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, shows the new servants around the house.  There are some weird house rules!  Every door must be closed and locked before the next one is opened.  The curtains must be drawn at all times.  Her children are photosensitive, you see, and could erupt in sores and smother to death if exposed to daylight.  Weird.  Kidman plays all her scenes with a wide-eyed neurotic energy - Grace is on the edge!  One wonders how Kidman the actress sustained this type of frenetic energy over the course of the shoot?  She's really good here.<p>THE OTHERS telegraphs its ending by dropping some clues along the way.  I had it figured out. The execution of the revealing scene is very good, though, and still manages to surprise you.<p>I jumped out of my couch several times.  The sound design is particularly good -- there's one scene where the thud-thud-thud of a "ghost" upstairs will shake you out of your chair!<p>Boo!</p></body></html>

In those five years, he made what are arguably his four greatest films: "Vertigo", "North By Northwest", "Pyscho" and "The Birds". It's hard tp pick which one of those films is THE best, but I think those are his four best films.<br /><br />The second movie in that quartet, "North By Northwest" is the subject of this review. Cary Grant reteams with Hitchcock for his fourth and last film with the Master of Suspense to play Roger Thornhill, a Manhattan advertising exec who is mistaken for a spy and is kidnapped by an organization trying to shut him up. Their leader (a menacing James Mason) as well as his ruthless henchmen (includign a young Martin Landou) will stop at nothing to see Thornhill out of the way, as he frames him for murder, chased across the country, and in one of the finest and most parodied scenes in motion picture history, nearly mowed down by a crop duster. To elude from harm, he enlists the help of beautiful counterspy Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). However, the enemies get wind of this, and now are more forceful than ever. This leads to an unforgettable climax atop Mount Rushmore.<br /><br />Well, wow. This film is incredible. Cary Grant's performance in this film may well be the best of his career. The same can be said for Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. Hitchcock's work behind the camera is very creative. His directing for the crop duster scene is, shot for shot, perfect. The extras are excellent. The featurette is highly enjoyable, as the commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who recently passed on. This dvd is a must for all movie fans.</p></body></html>

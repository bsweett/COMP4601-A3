<meta name="summary" content="Adventures in Narnia: Not Groundbreaking, But Still Enjoyable Fantasy Tale"></head><body><p>Without the spectacular commercial and critical success of `Lord of the Rings,' no one would have given a green light to the production of the faithful adaptation of `The Chronicles of Narnia.' In that sense, the first film made out of the seven books of C S Lewis cannot be seen without being compared with the Peter Jackson's trilogy. In short, is `Narnia' is as good as that?<br /><br />My answer is `almost.' Disney et al. made a decent fantasy film out of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." It is less ambitious in its scale and story, but the film's impressive visuals make up for its less imaginative direction and sometimes dull screenplay. The computer generated creatures are all remarkable, and the good lion Aslan is realized with the voice of Liam Neeson, who provides the dignity of the character.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is also impressive as White Witch. Probably she is more famous for playing the unique roles in such films as `Orlando' and `Constantine,' and her enigmatic presence perfectly fits in the ice queen character. Of course, that's unless you have already created your own image of the Witch, but her delightfully twisted acting worked for me. The four main young characters, the four children who wander into the land behind the wardrobe - Edward, Lucy, Peter, and Susan - are all played by newcomers, and their acting sometimes shows it. Not that I am complaining, but it must be admitted that the creatures in Narnia like giants, fawns, beasts, talking animals especially Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are more memorable in the film.<br /><br />Finally, about the tone of the film. The religious connotations are subdued, but you may not find it damaging. The producers are obviously aware that they are making a family picture, and the overall tone of the film is less dark than `Lord of the Rings' or recent `Harry Potter' films. And my verdict: "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is no groundbreaking achievement, but still an entertaining fantasy.</p></body></html>

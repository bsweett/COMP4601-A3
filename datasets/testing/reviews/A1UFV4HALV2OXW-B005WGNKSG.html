It follows the story line closely and gives us a glimpse into journalist Mikael Blomkvist's search for Harriet Vanger. She disappeared more than forty years ago when she was 16 years old. Her family assumed she was murdered, but her Uncle Henrik Vanger doesn't believe it and asks for Blomkvist's help. He enlists the young computer hacker, Lisabeth Salander, to work with him. Lisabeth's background is opened for a peek at a young girl on her own who is tortured mentally and physically by her court appointed guardian. She does fight back, which makes you cheer for her despite her bizarre characteristics. The story has twists and turns and you will not draw a deep breath until the very end! Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

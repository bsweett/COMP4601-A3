It is good that the hype and anticipation was not as big for the third installment as it was for T2, because the decent T3 would have been a terrible letdown.<p>T3 has a cute 'lil Terminatrix kicking outdated Arnold's a**.  The young man John Connor, who is more surly now than he was as a teen, is dragged all over kingdom come against his wishes.  He just wants to be left alone.  He does not want to be anyone's saviour.  Claire Danes is there to keep him in line along with Arnold.  <p>There is a fine line in films between being dark, and being depressing.  T3 is dark, but it comes near the line.  In essence, T3's message is that you cannot escape your fate, no matter how hard you try.  The only thing you can do is deal with it.  It really makes you think, which bespeaks well for the film.  I think a T4 is in order to bring back some of the hope for humanity that this third film took away from the first two films, and indeed that the last ten years have taken away from the innocent early '90's in this country.  Arnold looks physically wonderful in this movie, hardly different from the second film. He is an inspiration to all.</p></body></html>

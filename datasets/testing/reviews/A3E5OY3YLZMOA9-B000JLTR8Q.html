Night Shyamalan movie and like most people I have also had my share of problems with them as well. No matter what you think of him or his films he will no doubt always give an interesting story and he does so with Lady in the Water. Like one of the characters say in this film "the world no longer has any originality" I definitely agree. With Lady in the Water you get complete originality with a weird array of characters. Paul Giamatti (Cleveland Heep) plays a building manager of an apartment complex that unexpectedly becomes part of a living fairytale.<br /><br />Only thing is you truly don't know if there will be a happy ending or not. While patrolling the swimming pool on a late night Cleveland slips on the wet cement and falls into the pool. He wakes up on his couch to a pale woman with red hair (Bryce Dallas Howard) sitting across from him. She tells him her name is story and that she is scared so he lets her stay for a while. After a bit he carries the sleeping story outside so she can return home but Cleveland is chased back into his home by a wolf like creature. Story won't tell Cleveland too much as she doesn't truly know everything herself. Cleveland finds out from one of the tenants a story that sounds similar to what's been happening around him. He realizes that Story is just trying to go home and that the creature does not want her to go and will kill her before she can get the chance.<br /><br />Unlike the trailer for "The Village" what you see in the trailer for "Lady in the Water" is what you get in the film. No real big plot twist, Shyamalan left the movie the way it was without the crazy twist. He even has a bigger role in this film and it was a lot better than his past appearances that he's known for. The story itself is what you'll truly appreciate this movie for. Shyamalan put everything together so well that you start to forget that it's totally unreal for these events to happen. It's a type of story that has been done plenty of times in films like "Kate and Leopold" or even for kids something like "A Kid in King Arthur's Court". "Lady in the Water" is done in such a serious manner that you can't really compare it to those other films. The film gets more exciting and interesting as it goes on and more characters start to participate.<br /><br />The apartment complex gave Shyamalan a plethora of characters to work with and he added them very well. Somehow he gave each of them a purpose in the movie and it didn't feel overcrowded in any way. This movie was done with great style that makes it very entertaining. The score and pacing were done in a way that made it feel serene but still got you into the film enough to keep watching. The cinematography is very well done, perfect colors to make the feeling of it complete. This is a movie I would definitely recommend to some but not all as not everyone will be able to let their imaginations go to truly enjoy it.</p></body></html>

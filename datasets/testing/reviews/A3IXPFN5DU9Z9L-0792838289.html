<meta name="summary" content="Even in a Post USSR World the Original Still Resonates"></head><body><p>The original Manchurian Candidate remains a gripping, well executed exploration of paranoia and subterfuge, an impressive feat, considering the film is nearing its 50th anniversary.<br /><br />Those who have seen the remake with Denzel will be familiar with the basic story, but there are enough differences in the plot and plenty of strong performances to make it worth watching this one as well. The original is certainly the stronger of the two versions, with better character development, particularly of the inwardly-tortured, outwardly-icy Raymond Shaw.<br /><br />The special edition has a bunch of interviews with the stars of the original, including Sinatra and Lansbury. I found the restored picture and audio quality to be superb. Highly recommended classic.</p></body></html>

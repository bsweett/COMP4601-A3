<meta name="summary" content="Dark and Disturbingly Terrorizing Horror Film..."></head><body><p>Fear of death has overrun society, as fear provides the primal motivating factor to keep people alive.  A notion that Saw (2004) once capitalized on through the evil contraptions that the psychopathic mastermind Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) created to muse himself over innocent people's desire to live.  Jigsaw forced his victims to a rude awakening where his victims learned how and when they would die, unless they acted without hesitation.  Many of the psychopath's devices focused on gruesome self-mutilation that had a clear connection with the victim's character and past.  For Jigsaw, it is a game where he forces his victims to take the test of survival, and if they fail - they die!<br /><br />The sequel opens in a similar fashion under the cutting light of a naked light bulb where a man awakens undressed with a brutally looking device strapped to his neck and shoulders.  It is clear that the victim is not completely without sin, as he is a police informant.  In order to survive the contraption's bear trap consequence he must obtain a key behind his own eye.  There is an obvious presence of sadistic cruelty, as the man feebly attempts to find a solution to the problem before him.  The resolve of the situation assures the audience that more gruesomeness and terrorizing horror will emerge within the next hour and a half, as the viewer is to experience a fear-inducing sequel with more of Jigsaw's ruthless games.<br /><br />Unlike the films predecessor, Saw II does not attempt to hide Jigsaw's identity.  Instead, he seems to intentionally seek the law enforcement to apprehend him.  In particular Detective Matthews' (Donnie Walhberg) whom Jigsaw singles out through the message "Look closer Detective Matthews."  Quickly, Det. Matthews understands the clues, which leads them to an abandon factory where Jigsaw awaits.  Together with Det. Kerry (Dina Meyer) who leads the investigation, Matthews enters the factory with a S.W.A.T. team and after some blood-spattered predicament finds Jigsaw calmly inhaling oxygen through his oxygen mask.<br /><br />At first, one must sense that it is a trap, and it is, as Jigsaw has kidnapped Matthews's son along with eight other shady characters.  These nine individuals are locked up in a house of unknown location where they have been breathing a highly toxic nerve agent that will begin to dissolve their bodies into bleeding mess of flesh.  In a time when the American people fear terrorist attacks and weapons of mass destruction the concept will undoubtedly enhance the suspense.  However, if additional thought is placed on the concept of the nerve gas, it also provides a huge plot hole. It is not like people can buy nerve gas at the street corner, and it makes it a little amusing that Jigsaw is able to find it.  In addition, nerve gas does not, as far as I know, produce symptoms similar to hemorrhagic fever.  But, if the audience is willing to see beyond this slightly distorted reality, then Saw II will bring a terrorizing experience.  All Matthews can do is watch his son and the others slowly being decimated by Jigsaw's little games within the game.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jigsaw insists to talk with Matthews, as he enlightens Matthews that he must play by his rules if he wants his son alive.  It is with a great deal of irony that Jigsaw has planned this meeting with Matthews, as the detective often plays by his own rules when he arrests suspects.  Besides planning his own capture, Jigsaw has one final triumph up his sleeve, which he plays with brutal refinement when time runs short.<br /><br />The film possesses disturbing imagery of torture, murder, and other unsettling themes that are presented through Jigsaw's meticulous planning.  The cinematography helps to enhance the dark and agonizing atmosphere through the green camera filter.  In addition, the lighting of the scenes provides additional atmospheric elements that heighten the terror.  Special effects also provide a large bulk of the gruesomeness within the story.  Together with the fundamental concept stemming from the fear of death these visual aspects succeeds in bring forth a traumatic experience.  One of the negative aspects of the film rests within the characters that are portrayed in a too stereotypical perspective and they lack a complex psychology.  The film could also exploit the possibilities of a more profound meaning of why people fear death, which might have augmented the element of horror within the film.  Yet, the overall cinematic experience brings the audience into a disturbing world where horror and terror work very well and leave the audience truly frightened.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First Avenger..."></head><body><p>2011's "Captain America: First Avenger" does a nice job stitching together a superhero's World War Two origins with his future as a member of the present day Avengers, wrapped around a good period action movie with a great villain and some neat special effects.<br /><br />In 1942 Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (an earnest Chris Evans) is a under-sized but spunky straight-arrow kid who can't get into the military.  A quirky scientist named Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and gets him into a secret super-soldier experiment run by the gruff Colonel Philips (Tommy Lee Jones) and his lovely English spy assistant Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).  The experiment succeeds beyond expectations, turning Rogers into an incredibly strong, fit, and hyper-agile human being.  When a Nazi assassin kills Erskine, Rogers discovers what the audience already knows, that the Nazis have their own superhuman, the ruthless Red Skull (Hugo Weaving in snarling full Germanic mode) who has evil designs rivaling those of his boss, Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />Rogers is diverted to a war bonds drive as the costumed Captain America, but when he learns from Carter and Philips that his best buddy from Brooklyn is missing in action, Rogers gets into the war in a big way.  A series of action sequences set up a big finale against the Red Skull, with a bittersweet ending.  Fans are urged to hang through the credits for a nice teaser to the 2012 "Avengers" movie.<br /><br />With the exception of two brief scenes set in the future, "Captain America" manages a nice retro feel without drowning in nostalgia; even the high tech stuff looks period appropriate.  A brief romance between Rogers and Peggy Carter is handled with commendable and touching restraint.  A cameo by Samuel L. Jackson nicely frames the ending.  "Captain America: The First Avenger" is highly recommended to fans of the current series of Marvel Comic superhero movies.</p></body></html>

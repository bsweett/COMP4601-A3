<meta name="summary" content="Captivating"></head><body><p>A young ballerina is selected as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, replacing an aging star that was forcibly retired. She must deal with a difficult director, an overbearing mother, and the jealousies of her fellow dancers. She is being terrorized by one of the other dancers, and has to deal with psychotic episodes. The film succeeds at thrusting the viewer into the world of a woman who is achieving her dream, which turns out to be more of a nightmare. The strange psychotic episodes that she endures blur the line between fantasy and reality for not only her, but the audience. This film is a very strong effort that will capture the audience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Will Blow You Away"></head><body><p>I very rarely find a film that I can rate five stars. In fact, this may be a first for me. Guillermo Del Toro's fairy tale for adults, Pan's Labyrinth, is quite possibly the best film that I've seen in a number of years.<br /><br />The film has the ability to challenge the viewer to think about the choices he or she makes in daily life and to confront the results of those choices. The film deals with the idea that magic is a way to escape the brutal reality of daily life.<br /><br />At its simplest this is the story of a young girl, Ofelia who has to invent a fairy tale land of her own as she is confronted with the barbarism of post WWII Spain. The movie reveals itself in fairy tale fashion. Characters are either all good or all evil there is no middle ground.<br /><br />Forced to live witha sadistic Captain who has married her mother, the child escapes to magical realms and performs tasks in order to claim her rightful place as a princess. To offer more would be to give away a story that you need to become lost in.<br /><br />I viewed the two disc Platinum Edition whic features the commentary of the director and many production featurettes. The Commentary is especially insightful and should not be missed.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and see one of the best movies of 2006. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

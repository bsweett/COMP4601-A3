Sweet, sage, and funny, Rob Reiner delivers another heartwarming gem that's rejuvenating to watch.<br /><br />They couldn't be more opposite.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is a wealthy owner of hospitals where the frills are fleeting at best.  "We run hospitals, not health spas," Edward brashly tells his potential clients.  "Two guests to a room, no exceptions."  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is mild and wise.  He is a mechanic at a garage supporting his family, but is an academic at heart and a trivia expert who would make Cliff Claven blush.  A fellow colleague is always trying to stump him with questions from a trivia book, and Carter's favorite past time is to blurt out the answers (questions really) while watching 'Jeopardy'.<br /><br />You guessed it.  They both have cancer and have to share a room in one of his hospitals.  Thomas* (whose real name is Matthew, but is too hard for Edward to keep track of) is his assistant.  He can't have his own room because it would be bad PR not to follow his own rules.  Edward does get top service by his doctor (Rob Morrow who plays a far different MD than he did on `Northern Exposure'.)  The odd couple take a while to warm up to each other.  Each is absorbed in his own interests, and each has foibles that would annoy anyone.<br /><br />As their prospects both turn terminal, Edward comes across Carter's "bucket list".  Meant to be a whimsical exercise from Carter's philosophy professor, it gets them thinking about using their precious last moments to do what they haven't done before.  Edward has the money but Carter has the wisdom, so sorting out their priorities turns from a final blessing to a final battle.  Carter, who always wanted to be a history professor, decides to take up Edward's offer to take a whirlwind tour of the world and discover the joys of skydiving and race car driving to name just two.  ("You gonna drive it or give it a dress?" asks an impatient Edward to Carter the mechanic who would truly appreciate the opportunity.)<br /><br />This is all to the chagrin of Virginia, (also Ginny)[Beverly Todd], Carter's devoted nurse wife.  ("You're a fool who's figured out a way not have cancer," she chides her husband.  And to Edward:  "My husband is not for sale.")  Carter rekindles Edward's ability to think deeply.  He offers Edward the challenge that below the surface relationships and getting one's house in order really matter.  It's not just about the fun.<br /><br />Once they're on the road, they have several disagreements.  One of the best merits of the movie is how it can transition from fun and funny to philosophical.  Some may find the whole affair ponderous, but I loved the way both grapple emotionally, physically, and intellectually to the challenges that death provides.  If you liked books and movies like '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008L3SE">Tuesdays with Morrie</a>,' then surely 'Bucket List' should appeal to you.<br /><br />We've all seen "The Little Old Lady from Pasadena" routine so often:  Gramps or granny is in a hot rod, saying displaced things like "cool" and "far out."  It usually is funny and offensive at the same time.  This factor couldn't be more remote from the film.  There's never a bitter aftertaste when watching the elderly men doing young things.  It's all done thoughtfully and tastefully.  The dialogue is excellent.  The jokes are funny; the questions posed are interesting, but without the dead ends, for they provide some thoughtful answers as well.<br /><br />Watching this film reminds me that watching a three-and-a-half-star film can sometimes be more rewarding than watching a full five-star film.  In the end, 'The Bucket List' is a feel good movie with some substance that should be put on your movie "list".<br /><br />(*Sean Hayes whom I recognized, but didn't figure out 'til late to be the 'Will and Grace' star in a far different role.)</p></body></html>

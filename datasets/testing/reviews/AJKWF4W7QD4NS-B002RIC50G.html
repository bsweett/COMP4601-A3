Hannibal Rising is a prequel to everything else we've seen our favorite cannibal in, and upon viewing it you may wish you hadn't.  If you read Thomas Harris' Hannibal novel, then you'll probably remember the brief glimpse of backstory given to Hannibal Lecter's (Gaspard Ulliel) origin, of which this prequel capatilizes on.  As we witness the atrocities performed on Lecter and his family, we see the boy grow towards adulthood with revenge on his mind, and who can blame him really?  What kills Hannibal Rising is that Lecter isn't frightening at all throughout the film.  What helped make Silence of the Lambs so good, and to a degree Red Dragon (I wasn't fond of Ridley Scott's Hannibal at all) is that Lecter was a frightening, and brilliant, psychopath who became one of the most memorable screen villians of all time.  Here, he's relegated to a sympathetic state, and it doesn't work.  Not to mention that to say that Gaspard Ulliel doesn't fit the role is saying it lightly, and the rest of an otherwise solid cast (including Gong Li, Kevin McKidd, and Dominic West) are pretty much wasted in their roles.  Peter Webber's direction, while stylish, is ultimately empty, and a majority of the film plays out like an overlong slasher.  While there are a good amount of creepy moments and some solid, grisly effects, Hannibal Rising is a dud, and hopefully, the means to an end for a franchise that has been picked clean.</p></body></html>

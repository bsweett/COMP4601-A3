The acting is ok, Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams steal the movie, they play sisters in the film - one is crazy the other is down-to-earth. Christopher Walken seems very out of place and Jane Seymour is not a hot cougar, ugh! There are some good laughs but mostly this movie is over-rated.</p></body></html>

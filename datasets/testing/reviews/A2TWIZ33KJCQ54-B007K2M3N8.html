Spacey utilized a somewhat novel technique of non-linear storytelling, by simply telling a story-within-a-story, and having two Bobby Darins, [young and adult] giving their deliberately narcissistic perspectives [as interpreted by Spacey], and thereby adding insight to the scenes.<br /><br />'OUT TO SEA' IS ABOUT - STYLE - PACE - ENTERTAINMENT & TRUTH<br /><br />A combination of depth and a fast pace, was established by Spacey, by turning to a collection of stylized epic musical videos, of sight and song, to depict movement and change as Darin's life progresses. This turned out to be an economical, and entertaining device that kept the film from slowing down or becoming too heavy with drama and tragedy, which of course punctuates the end of Darin's life, but not of this film's. Spacey simply did not go down the road to death's melo-dramatic door. Instead, he had the movie-within-a-movie device take a detour, and allow the film to end as celebration of Darin's life with yet another tasteful, epic, music video. This effectively avoided the excessive sadness that inevitably permeates the later scenes of most biopics, since inevitably the star dies and/or fades, but Spacey adroitly avoided this, and it is for many, a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />THE CAST:<br /><br />Kevin Spacey - Bobby Darin<br />Kate Bosworth - Sandra Dee - turns in a solid honest performance<br />John Goodman - Steve Blauner - excellent strong side-kick<br />Bob Hoskins - Charlie Cassotto Maffia - always there for Bobby<br />Brenda Blethyn - Polly Cassotto - Bobby's mother<br />Greta Scacchi - Mary Duvan - Sandra Dee's domineering stage-mother<br />William Ullrich - Little Bobby - Excellent foil for the adult Bobby<br /><br />AWARDS:<br /><br />Best Soundtrack (nom) 2004 Broadcast Film Critics Association<br />Best Young Actor (nom) William Ullrich 2004 Broadcast Film Critics Association<br />Best Actor - Comedy or Musical (nom) Kevin Spacey 2004 Golden Globe<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD & SPECIAL FEATURES: WISH THERE WAS MORE ABOUT DARIN'S LIFE<br /><br />There is a short featurette with Spacey and members of the cast, but this film needed more due to the heaviness of the topic and the personal interest that was rekindled in Darin by this film.<br /><br />IN THE END: A FILM THAT MAKES ONE WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT BOBBY DARIN!<br /><br />Spacey was sensational, and the entire cast really shined. The soundtrack that Spacey did, standing in for Darin, was both awesome and accurate. This is a film that is honest, and hard-hitting without being melo-dramatic or sappy, which is probably the way Bobby Darin would have wanted it.</p></body></html>

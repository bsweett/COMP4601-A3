His alter ego is played by the vulnerable Edward Norton, an excellent choice. The special effects are at times magnificent, convincingly in harmony with the real life cinematography. Liv Tyler plays a sensual, sympathetic girl friend and John Hurt delivers cold determination with the prophecy of redemption in his caring eyes. Some parts of this well filmed movie take place in beautiful Brazil. Overall, a good film.<br /><br />It is a film that unexpectedly turns its cultural attention, for a time, away from our shores, and to South America. I enjoyed the attempts at expanding its borders and giving a scale larger than its predecessors, and perhaps its comics. The boost is needed for a film that really, perhaps, shouldn't have been given another chance considering the hushed hype that this franchise has. Its fans, are no doubt, no less enthusiastic than say, Spider mans, but the numbers are surely lesser.<br /><br />But the Hulk, is a change in what we know to be superhero's. He is unstable, and unpredictable, and can you say that the green monster really is a good guy all the time? He is a beast, with mega strength, and an anger problem that is dangerous, and like a loaded gun, only needs to be pointed in a direction. If you happen to be standing in the way, you are in trouble. And for me, there isn't a classic nemesis to battle with the Hulk that has yet to catch our nations attention. We don't have, say, supermans Lex Luther. We have mutated poodles? That is lame.<br /><br />Hulk is presented in sometimes good CGI, but it never amazes as the title would lead you to think. It's editing is more impoved over Ang Lee's version, which did not stick to a winning formula. Here, the pull back a bit on the Comic page edits, and for a time tried to be more serious, like Christopher Nolans Batmans serious, but don't get me wrong, it never operates on the classic level of Nolan's Batman series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding leadership example with incredible attention to seafaring details"></head><body><p>As a former naval officer I remember sitting through a showing of the movie "Twelve O'Clock High" in our leadership classes.  The movie was used to demonstrate contrasting leadership styles. "Master and Commander," if it had been available all those decades ago, would have been an excellent movie to demonstrate the the calm, calculating thought, often accentuated with a smile, that is required in a leader when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  Russel Crowe's Jack Aubrey demonstrates that trait beautifully.<br /><br />Leadership aside though, the movie's attention to seafaring detail is phenomenal.  Although I was part of the modern Navy, the DTS soundtrack of the movie captures the constant intrusions of sounds at sea; all the squeaks, clanks, snores, footsteps, splashes, wisps and howls of the wind are an ever present character in the film.  Of particular note was the use of the "chipset," a simple device that used knotted line to accurately give the ship's speed in "knots."  Also, though easy to miss, there is a scene while the ship is attempting to "round the Horn" at the tip of South America, where it shows a sailor using the "head," the nautical term for the toilet on the ship.  If you look carefully as the camera pans from the front to the back of the ship, you'll see a sailor with his pants around his ankles sitting on a holed plank off the front or "head" of the ship.  For obvious reasons the head was placed as far as possible from the captain's quarters, the area at the far aft (back) of the ship.<br /><br />Finally, the acting in the movie is exceptional, the battle scenes chaotic, and the cannonball shots impressive. You almost want to duck as the cannonshots approach and tear through the ship.  Whether you buy the DTS encoded DVD or Blu-ray, the battle scenes will impressively exercise your home theater system.</p></body></html>

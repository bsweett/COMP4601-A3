<meta name="summary" content="Nice Adventure: Not Quite an Indie Flik"></head><body><p>This is a worthy entry into the Indiana Jones canon, though (lynch me for saying it, but it's the truth) it is a little disappointing. The action is fun and there is plenty of humor. It isn't as dark as the black sheep in the series: The Temple of Doom. However, it doesn't feel quite like a true Indy movie. Without giving anything away, (but you do get this feel fairly early on anyway) it's much more Sci-Fi than the previous Indy movies have been. The original trilogy was all about mystical objects that had magical or theological powers. Here it isn't so much magic as science.<br /><br />And before you call foul, the legend of the skulls is a real one and this movie took one of the theories surrounding the skulls and brought it to life, so it was more than sci-fi sensationalism. However, it still didn't quite ring true to Indy's repertoire.</p></body></html>

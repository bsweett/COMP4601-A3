<meta name="summary" content="The American Revolution brought to life!!!"></head><body><p>Having read other reviews here, I am curious as to why people think this is unreal?, it is one of the most realistic & authentic movies about the Revolution, our history books only tell so much about this particular time, just because you didn't read certain aspects of this movie in history class, doesn't mean that some of it didn't happen, Set in 1776 in South Carolina during a time in which the British attempted to take over the eastern seaboard with their war against the settlers & I guess you could say decendents or deserters, the film clearly depicts a time in which the freedoms of this country was founded upon, Mel Gibson is Benjamin, a man who has seen war up close & personal in the french & indian war, & knows first hand its horrors, here he has settled for a normal quiet life with his seven children after his wife has died, in town, a meeting is being held in which British occupying forces will soon be upon them, Benjamin totally opposes the inpending war, that is until British forces invade his home & attack his family led by Captain Tavigton, played by Jason Isaacs(Armageddon) who is ruthless & brutal in his pursuit for victory,& a villian you just love to hate & can't wait for him to get his, Benjamin finally takes matters into his own hands & avengingly kills as many British troops as he can, he finally decides to take up arms against the British & leads a militia against the British, like Kevin Costner's "Dances with Wolves" this film really shows the beauty of as many landscapes as it can, & the strengh of men & the quest for the meaning of life & all we hold dear, Gibson gives one of the best performances of his career as a man with personal loss & patriotism, the viewer feels his anguish & his unrelenting behavoir to preserve the freedoms we have today, & that we take for granted, without those like him in this time, we might have all been British today, it was the ordinary men who fought alongside the Colonials that won our Democracy that we have today, & this film really makes that point clear, even if the history books don't, watching it, you realize that human behavoir hasn't changed much in 200 years, but is a winner & depicts the Revolutionary War in a positive light with a lot of accuracy, even if history don't, & one of Gibson's best movies!!</p></body></html>

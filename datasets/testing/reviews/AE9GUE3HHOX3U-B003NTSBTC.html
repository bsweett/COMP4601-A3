<meta name="summary" content="Shutter 2 Think"></head><body><p>I didn't know what to expect on Shutter Island, the movie's title is sort of off-putting and I thought it was going to be a relitively cheesey pocorn movie.  Then I realize it's directed by Martin Scorsese at the last minute and I enjoy most of his films.  If Shutter Island were directed by anyone else, it potentially could have went into another realm and direction and collapse from within.  I loved Leo Di Caprio in The Aviator and Titanic so he's gained my approval as a decent actor who really commits himself into the roles he's playing.  I was a bit apprehensive when I first heard the east coast accent he devolped for this role and I thought to myself, "am I going to have to listen to this crap all night?"  But then it seamlessly blends into his character and it just becomes him, which is quite impressive.  There is also something attractive about him that I can't quite put my finger on.  There's this subtle sexual undertone thing going on with him and I don't know if it's because I'm sexually atracted to him or if it's just because he's aging well and looks more handsome now.  This has nothing to do with the movie but it can influence your oppinions about his acting and the film itself.  Actually that's not true because I think Russel Crow is hot but I hate all of his movies, he's a crap actor. Never mind, I'm sorry.  I'm off on a strange tangent.  I enjoyed the intersting story in Shutter Island and it does throw you for a loop at the end when u find out that Leo is actually a patient at the facility.  It's sort of in the same vein as the ending in Nicole Kidman's "The Others" (another great movie).  It's very Twilight Zone-ish and creeps you out.  Shutter Island is the first movie I've seen this year that's actually entertained me.  Good movies are hard to find these days, just like men.  I wonder if Leo Di Caprio's single?  Hmmm......</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Super Romantic!"></head><body><p>Whether you're newly in love, an old married couple, hopelessly single or burned out and bitter, there is a storyline in this all-star ensemble piece that will make you laugh and cry.  Beautifully done film and superior soundtrack with a cheeky commentary track and poignant director's notes.<br /><br />Sure to please, bargain priced and also a great gift idea for anyone on your list!<br /><br />Only problem (and pet peeve) is the unescapable PREVIEW TRACK included...you can't even skip 'em, you have to fast forward through them.  Really obnoxious.  OK if it were a rental, but to stick these on to something you purchase is plain WRONG!</p></body></html>

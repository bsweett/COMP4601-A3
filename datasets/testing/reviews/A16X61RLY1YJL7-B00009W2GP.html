<meta name="summary" content="The Matrix Revolutions - An outstanding conclusion!"></head><body><p>Few things have shocked me more than the incredible amount of bad reviews for &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and the overwhelming amount of negative voting on positive reviews of this astonishing film.  In my opinion, many a fan of the original &quot;The Matrix&quot; film have taken the same tack that fans of the first three Star Wars did with Episodes I and II, in so much that it wasn't what &quot;they&quot; expected it to be so it wasn't any good in their &quot;opinions.&quot;  Just as Episodes I and II of Star Wars are the results of George Lucas's vision for those films, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and this; &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; are the sum of what the Wachowski brothers envisioned them to be.  That being said, I found their vision of where the films should go to be enormously entertaining on all levels, from bringing the story to its ultimate conclusion to its breathtaking action sequences.<p>I've never been a great fan of Keanu Reeves and his acting abilities but with this and the first two movies he clearly found a role that is well suited to his talents and this will most likely be the role he is most remembered for.  Carrie-Ann Moss's performances in all three films is incredible as well and, like Keanu Reeves, this will probably be the role she is most remembered for.  What can one say about Laurence Fishburne's performance in these films other than that it was incredible; of course, in most films I've seen him in he's been nothing less than an outstanding actor.  Although I think Hugo Weaving was erroneously given the role he was given in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, here in &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies he has left an indelible mark as one of the ultimate bad guys.<p>With the Matrix series of films, the Wachowski brothers as both writers and directors have clearly made a mark on the industry and any future films by them will definitely fall into the category of &quot;must see.&quot;<p>The Premise:<p>As &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; concluded we learned that Neo's seemingly super powers no longer ended when he left the Matrix but he is now in a coma.  The sentinels are continuing to bore down on Zion and Morpheus and Trinity learn that Neo, while not being plugged into the Matrix, is actually in the Matrix, but not where they might expect him to be...<p>What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films where the action sequence with the sentinels getting into Zion in an epic battle and Neo and Trinity's efforts to reach the machine capital will have you, the lucky moviegoer, on the edge of your seat the whole way, hoping and praying that everybody will make it...<p>Overall, I highly recommend &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and of course the first two films as they can be described as nothing less than an incredible cinematic experience and that these films will most certainly go into the history books as classics in the genre.  To those who have viewed this last film in the series negatively, I would definitely recommend another viewing with a more open mind, letting the movie maker's vision of the films direction through as opposed to your own.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Revolutions Recalibrated<br />-CG Revolution<br />-Super Burly Brawl<br />-Future Gamer:  The Matrix Online<br />-Before the Revolution<br />-3-D Evolution</p></body></html>

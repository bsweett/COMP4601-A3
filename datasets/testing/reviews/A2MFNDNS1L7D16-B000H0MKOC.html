<meta name="summary" content="In the Bizarro world, the  executives of the big cigarette"></head><body><p>corporations & thier lackeys, the lobbyists, are the good guys. The anti-smoking groups & individuals are evil & stupid. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a a pleasant, likeable guy. He has a gift of gab. He's a very good father & has b.s. to burn. Important to note. He loves his son & respects him as a person. His son an intelligent but quiet, reclusive child responds to the attention. Nick promotes the use of cigarettes or as he points out the promotion of free choice. His boss in this movie, says "they're cool they're available & they're addictive, they should sell themselves". Well, almost. An actual cigarette executive quote was, "Our future customers are poor, young, black & stupid".  Nick's life is threatened & he is almost killed in an unusaul way. He is kidnapped & literally, covered with nicotine patches, almost dying from an overdose. He recovers but is not longer allowed to smoke for health reasons. He becomes a sympathetic victim. The underlying message is, free choice, an idea that resonates well as a very American value. Lots of bit parts to go around: William Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes & more. The dvd extras on the copy I viewed were excellent. A Charlie Rose Show with all the principals (writer, producer, director & star) was very worthwhile. Deleted scenes  were shown with an explanation why they were deleted. I thought that they did a very good job editing them out. A really fun movie with comedy from the dark side.</p></body></html>

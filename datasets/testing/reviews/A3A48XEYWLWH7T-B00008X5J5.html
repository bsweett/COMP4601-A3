As a child during my `dinosaur' phase, I loved watching Maleficent turn into the dragon and fight Phillip. The story, you should know by now of course, young princess whisked away by three fairy `godmothers' to protect her from evil sorceress, raised in the forest unaware of her heritage, meets prince charming unaware he's a prince, eventually finds out they're betrothed to each other as prince fights sorceress.  The re-mastering technique employed on this DVD yielded incredible results, the image was actually more vibrant and colorful than originally aired in 1959 and it looks marvelous on today's widescreen HDTVs.  I was quite taken with the art, quite unlike anything Disney has done before or since with it's angular geometry and perpendicular themes.  Aurora and Maleficent duel for most beautiful Disney female forms to date.  The extras on the DVD are quite interesting as well.  The original theatrical companion pieces The Grand Canyon was sublime and the snippet of how four artists paint a tree helped glean a bit into the mindset of the brilliant artists on the Sleeping Beauty project.  Highly recommended, not just as a child's story, but as an impressive art piece and study of mood and texture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""This Ship is England!""></head><body><p>"Master and Commander" is a film I never tire of watching; it is a grand and glorious sea epic, with examples of courage and bravado, and a tumultuous battle sequence, as well as a film with great depth and meaning. The details of "this little wooden world" that is the English ship, as it chases a French man-of-war around the coast of South America in 1805, through the stormy Cape Horn, and finally landing in the Galapagos Islands, are astounding.  One gets the feeling of what it must have been like for the seamen in such close quarters for months on end. This is one of director Peter Weir's very finest works, in a career that has been replete with great stories told brilliantly on film.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is superb as Captain Jack Aubrey. His charismatic and virile presence fills the screen, and he is the perfect model of a heroic 19th century sea warrior. I always admire how Crowe subtly uses his voice to fit the part, a talent that is rare in actors these days. Equally excellent is Paul Bettany as the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Bettany will be remembered from his part in "The Beautiful Mind," the film that garnered Crowe an Oscar), and the interaction between these 2 extraordinary actors make for some memorable scenes. Another notable performance comes from Max Pirkis (recently seen as Octavian in the HBO series "Rome"), as the young Midshipman Blakeney.<br /><br />The cinematography by Russell Boyd is a marvel, especially the scenes in the Galapagos Islands, with its unique landscapes and strange creatures, and the soundtrack is a delight, using many lovely classical pieces, among them Bach's Cello Suite # 1, and Corelli's Concerto Grosso # 6. I recently viewed the Full Screen Edition of this film, which focuses on the expressiveness of the acting with its larger close-ups, and found it gave an added dimension to the film; I would recommend buying the Widescreen Edition, and perhaps renting the Full Screen Edition for additional viewing. "Master and Commander" is one of the most mature, satisfying, and engrossing films in recent years, not to be missed by anyone who enjoys adventure, along with a well-written script, intelligent characters, and the finest acting. Total running time is 138 minutes.</p></body></html>

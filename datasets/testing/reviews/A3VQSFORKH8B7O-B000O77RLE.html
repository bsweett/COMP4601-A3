In this film, Eastwood shows the Japanese mentality during the war, but also shows that some were uncomfortable with it. For me, it shows that, when you strip all politics and ideologies away from war, all true soldiers fight for the same reasons: for their country and those they love.<br /><br />The movie follows the actions of two key players. Oscar-nominee Ken Watanabe ("The Last Samurai") gives a great performance as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the man given the responsibility of commanding the garrison on the island of Iwo Jima. Here, we see a man who knows that fighting against the United States is a no-win situation, but will still defend the island for his country. Kazunari Ninomiya gives a fine performance as Saigo, one of the common soldiers in the Japanese army. His character is complex: one who didn't want to fight, but was conscripted to join the army, leaving his wife and child behind, and Ninomiya pulls of the part splendidly. The rest of the cast give great performances as well.<br /><br />While the film does move a bit slow at times, the great performances, fine storytelling, and exciting battle sequences more than make up for the film's slower passages. Overall, I say that "Letters from Iwo Jima" is a better film than "Flags of our Fathers," giving us a look at those we fought against in a kind, somber manner. I recommend this film to both historians and war-film afficinados.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

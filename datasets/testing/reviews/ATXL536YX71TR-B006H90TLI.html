<meta name="summary" content="Mixed feelings,but mostly negative on NO COUNTRY..."></head><body><p>Amazon asks us "Do we love,like,feel okay,dislike or hate " a film.They are ALL subjective terms.It leaves room for personal taste and interpretation.So,this will be a very tough and,I am sure,unpopular OPINION of mine,but here goes...<br /><br />I thoroughly disliked this film.The story offered nothing to me.I did not find it at all interesting.I did not care for any character.I found them all to be lacking in every sense of human dignity.I found the killing numbing.This film made me feel like Anton-cold and lifeless inside.I did not find it suspenseful.Each murder made me feel as though," Oh well,just another day at the office!"I really just wanted the film to end.The slow moving and exacting pace of the film was not to my liking,especially without any viable soundtrack.The film was very devoid of colors other than the browns and tans of desert and paneled motel rooms.The film had little dialogue.I did not like FARGO,so I suppose that the Coen Brothers are just not my style...but I can understand other people liking their films.<br /><br />What I did like was the way in which the film was cleverly cut in order to show the movements of Brolin,Bardem and Jones.It allowed the story to see all of the actions going on in each character.Still...not enough to hold my interest.<br /><br />There was one continuity error that glared at me which was The Regal Motel offered "Free HBO" on it's sign.Nope....not in 1980 it didn't.Check your facts.<br /><br />Javier Bardem was the only reason that I went to see this film.I love his work.Not even he could save it for me.It was fun to see Scottish actress Kelly Mac Donald play a Texas wife.That was unique.I'll be in the minority on this one.Here come the "not helpful votes"....Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another masterpiece from Ridley Scott! Fans of the ORIGINAL "Alien" will not be disappointed."></head><body><p>"Prometheus" is a glorious sci fi masterpiece. I haven't felt so enthralled by a film like this in years. When you see this film, you will realize how many of the sci fi films of the past fifteen years were all style over substance. Special FX films like "Avatar" and "Revenge if the Sith," which I love, cannot compete with this original vision and deep level of storytelling. Aside from films such as "Inception" and "Children of Men," many of the sci fi films that come out today lack originality, deep character development, and intelligence. Prometheus gives us that in spades, along with a sense of sci fi mysticism that I haven't felt in over a decade. It is amazing how Ridley Scott emulates everything that made his original Alien so great, while at the same time being able to stand completely apart from that film. It is rare that a sequel can stand on its own and at the same time give us the best of what the original gave us. In fact, this is exactly how I felt while watching this film; it gave me the same suspense and intrigue I had when watching the original "Alien" when I was a young boy. I am a huge movie buff and I have seen thousands of films and I can honestly say that this film will be around for a long time, being studied and revered for its great achievement in character development and film making. I honestly want to say that this is the best film in the "Alien" franchise since the original. Yes, "Aliens" was awesome but let's be honest; that was an action film. "Prometheus" takes us into the unknown and abandons us in filmmaking heaven; we don't know if whether we want to stay and marvel at the wonder of it all or flee in utter terror.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by all the actors. Everyone is raving about Fassbender's performance, which was great but Noomi Rampace was mind blowing. In my honest opinion she touched me on a more emotional level than Ripley ever did and that says a lot. I almost can't believe that I just typed that!<br /><br />The cinematography was breathtaking and the set pieces and designs make "Avatar" look like a Disney channel show.  I haven't seen sci fi FEEL so realistic since the early 80's films. Then again, that's why you hired the man; Ridley Scott!!<br /><br />The story is mesmerizing and captivating. Those who subscribe to or are interested in the ancient astronaut theory regarding the origins of man will adore this film. It will be twice as nice if you subscribe to the ancient astronaut theory and love "Alien", like me!! This film gave the "Alien" universe more credibility. It no longer feels like Hollywood magic. It feels like the possibility of an unknown terror being linked to the human destiny is out there in some dark corner of our universe. This film goes way deeper than any of the other "Alien" films ever did.<br /><br />There are also 2 scenes from this film that will stay with me forever. I couldn't stop thinking about these 2 sequences when I left the theater. It was like seeing the alien pop out of John Hurt in "Alien" for the first time. The reason why these 2 scenes are so powerful is because of the emotional resonance they have with the viewer, not because of gore, which is something rarely felt and seen in films today.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />I'm talking about the scene where Noomi gives herself a C-section, racing against the birth of her "alien" and when her lover is set alive on fire by the flame thrower. Boy, did this chick go through some tough stuff and I felt for her every minute!<br /><br />END SPOILER****<br /><br />This film will be misunderstood. People expecting to see a lot of action will be very disappointed. This film is all about mood, character development, mystery and suspense. Many people claim that this film doesn't have any answers, regarding the Alien mythology but I completely disagree. I left the film feeling 100% satisfied and received answers to nearly all my questions. Put it like this: the people who don't get this film are the same people who didn't understand Inception. The people who won't like this film are the people who didn't grow up to the original Alien or are turned off by films that don't have much action. For those who didn't get the "answers" to your questions, what is it exactly that you want? You want the film makers to spell it out for you? You want them to chew your food too?!<br /><br />Well I'll do it for you!! Really fast!<br /><br />SPOILERS!!<br /><br />The space jockey in the very beginning commits suicide because he has been stranded with malfunctioning biological weaponry created to destroy the human race, a race they genetically engineered. This biological weaponry is out of control and killing the space jockeys in terrible ways. Archeologists discover many ancient artifacts and relics throughout various cultures that depict the origins of our creators to be in the system of planets that the space jockeys are using to create their biological weaponry. An expedition goes underway and scientist come across some sort of a microbial black ooze and other substance in vases that eventually contribute to the creation of an evolutionary prototype of the face huggers (from Alien) when fused with a human. Apparently this black ooze is what the space jockeys have been engineering on the planet and when it comes into contact with another life form, it fuses to create something quite ghastly. Example, the black ooze merging with the worms  (this is slightly ambiguous but they showed those earth worm things for a reason) which caused the death of the two geologists who were stranded. The thousand year old black mural depicting the traditional alien we all know and love, and the fact that the dead engineers had burst chests, infer that the aliens are out there; a result of biological weaponry engineering and that black ooze. The engineers were perhaps experimenting with them, or trying to recreate them. Now when the black ooze merged with a human it drove them mad and through sexual reproduction creates a primitive form of the face hugger. When the face hugger merged with the space jockey it created a Xenomorph prototype. Basically, engineered microbial substance from vase + human + plus sexual reproduction = primitive face hugger. Primitive face hugger + space jockey = primitive Xenomorph. The Xenomorhps we know and love are both a product of biological engineering by the space jockeys and evolutionary adaptation. We don't see the exact aliens from the Alien franchise but we see their evolutionary ancestors and how they were created. The end.  HOW DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THIS PEOPLE??!!!<br /><br />As far as questions such as, "Where are the space jockeys from?" "What about that specific space jockeyship that was in "Alien", where is that?" For me those questions don't matter because the film stated that there was more than one ship on the planet and those ships can easily be hosting another space jockey. Honestly I could care less because all my bigger questions were answered about the space jockeys and the alien as a whole and I really don't care too much about that exact specific ship that was seen in Alien.<br /><br /> "Why did the space jockeys change their minds about the human race?" Just turn on your local news channel, you'll see why! It's ambiguous and it's supposed to be. The filmmakers want you to reflect on some of the themes presented and I thought that was great! It was awesome how the film doesn't give you all the answers. That's what made some of greatest films. That's what made Alien, Blade Runner, Inception, and Children of Men so great. This is one of those films people are going to watch over and over and keep finding new things in it every time...kinda like a couple of other movies buy this guy named Ridley. Thank you Ridley. Thank you for more poetry on celluloid.</p></body></html>

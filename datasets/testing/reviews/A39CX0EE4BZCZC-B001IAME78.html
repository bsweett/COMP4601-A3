<meta name="summary" content="Better Than Anticipated & A Great Blu-Ray Transfer"></head><body><p>I found this very entertaining and better than anticipated. Some folks might find it a big slow going in the first half hour but I enjoyed the colors and South American scenery during that time. I also enjoyed the acting of Edward Norton, who usually excels in whatever roles he plays.<br /><br />When the "Hulk" appears, it's pretty awesome even thought its also pretty obvious how computer-generated it looks....but who cares? The Green Monster might not have looked as realistic as the TV days when Lou Ferrigno was the big guy, but it looked very cool because of its size. If you enjoyed "The Sandman" in the last Spiderman movie, you'll enjoy this 2008 version of the Hulk, too.  By the way, if you can, watch both of those on Blu-Ray as they look incredible.<br /><br />One thing filmmakers do these days that I think is very nice is to pay tribute to the old actors who were in these stories years ago, either in film or on television. Here, there is a nice cameo scene by Ferrigno, who still looks in great shape, by the way. The former bodybuilder who was the green monster in the TV series that starred Bill Bixby, has a few lines in here as a security guard that will make you smile. I'm sure they would have had Bixby in this movie, too, had the man been alive. In the recent Superman film, "Superman Returns," we saw Jack Larsen and Noel Neill, who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, respectively, on the 1950s "Adventures of Superman" TV series. This has been done in a few other movies, too.<br /><br />The ending to this film also was clever and tied in with another recently-issued movie. That's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the surprise. It makes me anticipate what's on the horizon. Overall, this film was fun to watch and I definitely would view it again, especially with this great Blu-Ray transfer.</p></body></html>

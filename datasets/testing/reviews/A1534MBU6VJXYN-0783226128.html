A film that both influences and alienates. A film that stands the test of time as a masterpiece. "Scarface" is one of those movies. When it was first released in 1983, "Scarface" caused challenged the MPAA with its excessive use of violence, foul language and other cinematic taboos. Director Brian DePalma, screenwriter Oliver Stone, star Al Pacino and others involved with the film made sure that this film would become what it is today.<br /><br />There's no use in describing the plot, as anyone who hasn't been living under a rock since 1983 already knows it. Tony Montana (Pacino) is a Cuban immigrant who arrives at Mariel Harbor, in Miami, 1980. There, he gets involved in the only thing he knows how to do - drug dealing. Tony becomes rich. He has it all: money, women, power. However, as the stakes get higher, so does Tony (figuratively and literally). He throws away everything he earned and by the end of the movie, he can never get it back.<br /><br />This film is so powerful on so many different levels. This is more than just the film that made "Say Hello To My Little Friend" an international catchphrase. This is more than just the film that set the record for most uses of the "f" word (well over 200). This is more than just a typical shoot-em-up with oodles and oodles of violence. Look past all this silly stuff and you will find that "Scarface" is disturbing realistic and often terrifying in its brutal depiction of life. This film has influenced millions, from filmmakers to gangsta rappers. "Scarface" is a celluloid treasure.<br /><br />The way this film was done was perfect. The scenrery? Awe-inspiring. The directing? Superb. The script? Flawless. The acting? Phenomenal. Al Pacino has never done a better role than this. Had this film cut down on the cursing and possibly the length, Pacino would have definitely won an Oscar. The rest of the supporting cast deliver impeccable performances as well, including Steven Bauer, Maria Mastrentonio, Robert Loggia and especially Michelle Pfeiffer, who, at an early stage in her career, manages to steal the show from Pacino and everyone else at every chance she gets. Her final scene in the restaurant is unforgettable. Like Pacino, Michelle definitely deserved the Academy Award that year.<br /><br />Which brings us to the dvd itself. How does this 22 year old masterpiece look on dvd. Well, it looks and sounds great. The 5.1 sound and the Anamorphic Widescreen let you see and hear the movie like it was meant to be. As for bonus features, this film is, as Tony Montana might say, loaded. Deleted scenes, a slew of documenatries and various interviews with the cast and crew are all present and accounted for on this dvd.<br /><br />If you haven't seen "Scarface", you are depriving yourself of a work of art. Get it immediately.</p></body></html>

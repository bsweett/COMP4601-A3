While there has been tons and tons of movies that have used CGI and CGI has been commonplace everywhere, Spielberg's film still has the emotional power to stir and move like a legendary filmmaker should.  Jurassic Park will be the work of an aueter that keeps it from growing old, while so many films like it are now forgotten within a few years.  We all know that Spielberg's Jurassic Park is terrific entertainment, with thrills and chills on every corner.  But it also manages to be quite a powerful cautionary tale, doing something that films like Frankenstein still haven't been quite able to master.  Now how exactly can a film that made close to a billion and was a franchise starter and marketing powerhouse do that?<br /><br />This is why.  Michael Crichton book has more detail, science, and more ideological intelligence, but Spielberg's film has what Crichton's novel doesn't have: emotional intelligence to make his own viewpoints through behavior come across in a much more convincing way.  Behavior is real but an idea is not necessarily real.  Obviously, this is not an absolute, and the former can justify the reality of the latter, but this makes for a much more convincing and real argument.  Some people call this shallowness, but in my opinion, being able to paint the experience and emotional content of a complex emotional experience is not shallow, and Jurassic Park's scenes of consequence and danger are able do so, with kaleidoscopic emotion and<br /><br />The initial T-Rex scene, one of the most famous of them all, is a good example of this.  Spielberg directs the scene with danger, and the Dinosaur is absolutely primal, stripped down to it's instincts at dangerous cost.  This is a prime display of why Spielberg's Jurassic Park EXTREMELY succeeds in showing WHY tinkering with genetics can be so damn dangerous.  Spielberg also never sugar coats these animals abilities, reminding us of just how primal and vicious they can be.  These creatures can tear up a goat in half a second, they can find their way through environments looking for something to eat, stalk their pray and having no sense of right or wrong that humans do (like animals), and how these creatures are, all in all, extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY dangerous.  It's one reason why this is a valuable and piece of science-fiction, and why it's very much essential as much as other great films.<br /><br />Understandably, this is still a large budget thriller, with more thrills and chills than a roller coaster, but it's damn good one at that, made with talent and passion by Spielberg and company.  There are some underwhelming moments here and there, but some of these are overpowered by Spielberg's awesome visuals, spectacular sound design, and humanistic acting.  The CGI here, despite being somewhat stiff at times, recreates these Dinosaurs as you would expect, and there's a HUGE sense of AWE and BEING, LIFE, even nearly 20 years later.  But it's the sound of these creatures that works.  The ground shaking when a dinosaur lowers it's foot, the huge roars, and the primal ferocity of these animals that will send chills down your spine.  The bone chilling roar of the T-Rex makes you want to trample a city (seems fitting that Mastodon sampled it). I also think the production design is great as well, for what that's worth.  John Williams score is also amazing and uplifting.<br /><br />The character development is a little thin, but I think this is easily transcend with good performances.  Spielberg has a knack for being able to make his characters seem very real (no matter what other people try to convince me.  Nice try but you can't convince me), which really separates his ability from lesser hacks.  There's not a feeling of "cardboard" character, as they feel very much like what you would expect if you saw one of these people in life.  Even if you didn't have, Regarding the I give some props to Spielberg to not having a cloying "I'm ready for children I love THEM!" moment, but instead some subtly that shows Alan Grant's very realistic alleviation to his dislike of all children after finally opening his mind (or forced to, for a better word).  It's not too deep because characters are second, but it's got enough pathos to move you.<br /><br />I do think that Crichton's book is much more technical and layered, considering that he's a scientist and didn't have to work with David Koepp.  And I do think that the book obviously has value and does thing that Spielberg's film can't do (and vice-versa).  But the movie, for me, is better because it's just more convincing, and simply showing the is much more riveting and makes you think about the consequences of tinkering much more, simply because Spielberg.  On top of that, it has enough heart stopping moments to give, so that certainly doesn't hurt either.  I suggest reading the book to get more of the ideas and applying to the behavior on screen.<br /><br />It's too bad that Jurassic Park is considered to some to be a big soulless, dumb blockbuster film, because there's a lot here to chew on along with awesome special effects, entertaining performances, and white knuckle terror (this definitely isn't a film for young children).  Skip the sequel, as it's merely a cheap facsimile of this film, a big (and boring) budget monster movie with a 100 million dollar budget (the book isn't bad, although it was written more hastily because Spielberg pressured Crichton to write another book).  Whatever you do though, see this one for it's relevance and artistic intentions within one of the most well known pieces of entertainment.</p></body></html>

I haven't seen the original, but it seems to be more important that the Rat Pack was in it rather than anything to do with plot or story. And this remake is the same. It's more important that the Rat Pack was in the original movie rather than anything about this movie. It's a heist story, one that is plausible, though they gloss over many points (such as how did they know the layout of the vault to build the exact replica) and a few characters seem to have the ability to be in two places at once. They didn't attempt to create a new Rat Pack (except that they did, but in such a way that if it failed they could point to their interviews saying, we never tried to compare to the Rat Pack). They did put together an impressive cast. Clooney in the title role does the job he always does, and he does it well. Brad Pitt as his right hand man delivers the phenomenal performance that is typical of Pitt (in my opinion one of the best living actors). Matt Damon's role was small and irritating. Julia Roberts not only does one of her worst performances, but she also looks horrible in this film. Andy Garcia is over the top. And whoever decided to give Don Cheadle that accent ... <p>The dvd contains two commentaries, but I haven't watched either one--the movie just didn't impress me enough to watch it that many times. There is a behind the scenes segment which doesn't tell much. There is also a short documentary dealing with costume design. It could have been very interesting, since the costumes were great and important to the film (you can see the Sinatra influence on Clooney's costumes), but the documentary fell short and didn't really go into it.<p>I wouldn't buy this dvd, but I'd say it is worth the rental money.</p></body></html>

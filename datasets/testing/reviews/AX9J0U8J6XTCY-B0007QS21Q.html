WILL SMITH AS ALWAYS SPARKLES IN HIS LEAD ROLE, TAKING SERIOUSLY WHAT IS TRANSPIRING BEFORE HIM. HE IS STILL OUR ULTIMATE HERO HERE, AS IN HIS OTHER WORKS IN FILMS. THIS INCREDIBLY EXCITING FILM WAS TRULY A REAL BLAST FROM START TO EXCITING CLIMAX. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME, AND THIS DIGITAL TRANSFER, FROM 20TH CENTURY FOX REALLY EXCELS ON MANY LEVELS. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH PRISTINE, AND THE USE OF THE DTS AUDIO WILL TRULY SHAKE ANY ROOM IN YOUR HOME, WHEREVER IT IS SET UP! WOW, WHAT A DVD, AND WHAT A GREAT SUMMER FLICK THAT HAS TRANSPIRED INTO ONE OF THE YEAR'S END TOP MUST OWN DVDS. WILL, KEEP ON TRUCKIN, GUY YOU DEFINITELY RULE, AS DOES "I, ROBOT". IT'S A KEEPER FOR SURE.</p></body></html>

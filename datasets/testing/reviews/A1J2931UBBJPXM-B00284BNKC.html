And it's not a pretty picture.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are young and in love, but they have a problem; their recreational drug use has long since passed the point of "recreation," and the sad part is, they don't seem to realize it, or if they do, they're into big time denial.  Harry's friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is in the same situation, and together they spend most of their time and resources trying to score their next fix.  Even the fact that Harry has to repeatedly hock his own mother's television set for drug money doesn't clue them in to how deep their addiction runs; which is a truly sad state of affairs.<p> Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a widow who lives alone, and only wishes that her son, Harry, would come around to see her once in awhile, besides when he needs her beloved TV, which is her only real companion in life.  Sara doesn't realize it, but there's troubled times ahead for her, too, which begin with a telephone call informing her she's been chosen to appear on a television show, which to her is like being given the Holy Grail.  Immediately, she begins to prepare for the moment, but she is bothered by her weight-- her favorite dress doesn't fit anymore.  She's just too fat (she feels) to go on TV.  The solution she discovers, however, is easy.  Prescription diet pills, provided by a doctor recommended to her by one of her friends in her apartment building.  Diet pills, nothing more.  It seems so harmless.<p> Director Aronofsky doesn't pull any punches with this film, and shows-- often in graphic detail-- just what drugs can do to a person.  Some of the images he presents are hard to take, and are not easily forgotten; like the effects of a needle on an arm when injected repeatedly into the same spot over a prolonged period of time, or the delusions caused by ingesting vast amounts of "speed."  But the visuals he offers are not the only powerful images; the psychological implications are quite potent as well.  Each character at one time or another seems to comprehend, during one of their few-and-far-between lucid moments, what's happening to them.  But they either do not want to address their situation, or they can't.  Either way, it's harrowing to watch, let alone contemplate.  <p> Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her work here, and rightfully so; her performance as Sara, a woman who gets taken unawares and must do battle with an unexpected demon, is astounding.  It's a challenging, decidedly unglamorous role, and Burstyn certainly gave it everything she had, and it paid off.  Sara is someone with whom you can sympathize on a number of levels, while at the same time, the way she comes into her situation is so disconcerting it makes you want to keep her at arms length, because it's something you don't really want to have to think about.  Out of sight, out of mind.  It's an emotionally taxing part-- for Burstyn, of course-- but for the audience, as well.<p> Jared Leto gives an extremely convincing, believable performance, also, but his character tends to evoke mixed feelings.  On one hand, you feel terrible for him, but on the other, you realize that-- unlike Sara-- Harry came to where he is because of his own unsound judgment and choices, which casts a rather subjective pall over his circumstances, and therefore the way you relate to him.  Still, there's no getting around the fact that it's a depressing situation (to say the least) for everyone involved.<p> The same can be said of Connelly's character, Marion, who seems to go deeper into her situation than the others with her eyes wide open, and it's disturbing to see someone so young, vital and seemingly intelligent allowing this to happen to herself.  Connelly, who admirably of late has forsaken mainstream cinema for roles of more substance in independent films (like "Pollock" and "Waking the Dead"), turns in a memorable performance here, capturing that dark side of human nature and expressing it so well in terms of her character and the path she chooses to take.  And of all of the characters in the film, it is through Marion that you really get a sense of the degradation and loss of self-esteem that comes with the territory to which these people have staked a claim.  And it's just almost too horrendous to consider.<p> The supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald (Tappy Tibbons), Louise Lasser (Ada), Marcia Jean Kurtz (Rae) and Peter Maloney (Dr. Pill).  A powerful anti-drug film, "Requiem for a Dream" is a stark and realistic look at a problem that affects everyone either directly or indirectly, and it's so effective because there's no attempt to candy-coat the issue.  Aronofsky tells it-- and shows it-- like it is, and like "Trainspotting" and "Traffic," it gives you a real grasp of just how far into our lives the tentacles of this evil reaches, and how vulnerable we all really are to it.  This film may be a sobering trip, but it's definitely one worth taking.</p></body></html>

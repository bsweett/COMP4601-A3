You Bruce Campbell addicts will jump for joy over you're mummy's sarcophagus, as Bruce fights the evil of "Bubba-Ho-Tep," as no other than the "King of Rock n' Roll" himself, Elvis, or at least he thinks so. Ossie Davis is his cohort in battling this evil, or should I say, cohort in delusion, as he thinks he's president, "JFK." Only one problem, he's black. Never the less, the dynamic duo set out to battle evil incarnate, "Bubba-Ho-Tep, to save their home & fellow neighbors, living in a retirement home from certain death & damnation!<br /><br />Campbell's best film since "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn," & possibly his best performance too, though you got to love Ash in "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" & especially "Army of Darkness." Either way, "Bubba-Ho-Tep" is a moldy bundle of funny bones, all wrapped up in a smartly directed, well acted, piece of brilliance. Bruce Campbell may well be the most overlooked comedic actor of his generation, & that people, is the true horror! A shame.</p></body></html>

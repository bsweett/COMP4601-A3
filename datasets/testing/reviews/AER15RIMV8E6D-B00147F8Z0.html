<meta name="summary" content="A Very Bad Sequel!!!"></head><body><p>I saw this on 1-1-08 and I thought it would be cool to start off the year with an AVP movie. I was highly disappointed. Mostly the ending pissed me off with the Government killing all the suvivors in the town and the Aliens and Predators. I was cool that it started where the first one ended, but it's just that ending that really gets me. I remember some goth kids in the theatre laughing when the girl said something like "The Government doesn't lie to people." Don't watch this movie!!!<br /><br /> THE GOVERNMENT RUINED IT!!!</p></body></html>

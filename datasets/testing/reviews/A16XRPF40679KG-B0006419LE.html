<meta name="summary" content="a good ape picture."></head><body><p>As far as I am concerned , there wasn't a bad ape movie, not one of the five, although the first is a real classic by any standards, the others are each interesting in their own rights. Each was different and had a central theme to it. this ones theme is more of a straight continuation of the first movie and it succeeds; but to be honest it's not near as good as the first one but then that was something altogether new!. Still it's got alot of cool stuff going on here and the ulitmate seventies disaster doom ending. Which was a strange thing to do , as they could have kept the story alive in that time! But it allowed them to create a really good drama in the next one. The blu ray looks great on this one and the others too and I have them all so I should know! Anyways the series is pretty good too although it's not on blu ray it's still good.</p></body></html>

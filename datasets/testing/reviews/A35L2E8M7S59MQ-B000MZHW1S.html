In a way you could easily classify Blood Diamond as being a Hotel Rwanda film for audience members who aren't in the mood for pure drama.  So instead the issues are mixed into a classy, well thought out action thriller.  More recently we saw this concept used well in District 9, which addressed the issue of racism, slums, and xenophobia in South Africa.  This contemporary method of informing the public often turns in good films when done right and Blood Diamond does it right.<br /><br />Though not the greatest film dealing with conflict in Africa it draws enormous amounts of strength from  Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housou (both earned Academy Award nominations for their roles) who play a mismatched pair that has to work together.  DiCaprio is Danny Archer, a white mercenary (who specializes in smuggling conflict diamonds to fund private wars) from Rhodesia (modern day Zimbabwe) who feels that by getting his hands on a rare "blood diamond" he will have enough money to leave Africa and retire.  This diamond has been found, but the only one who knows of its location is the man who found it: Solomon Vandy (Housou).  Vandy's son has been abducted by the guerrilla forces and after escaping slavery at the hands of the rebel group he meets Archer and makes an agreement that he will help him find the diamond, but only if he assists in rescuing his son.<br /><br />A wonderful film with the expert direction of Edward Zwick, Blood Diamond is a good film. I suppose my only gripe with the film would be its lack of concentration in regards to the conditions of Sierra Leone. Some things are just simply skimmed over, such as the issue of child soldiers, which I thought was one of the main issues the film was supposed to address. I don't know if this has to do with regulations on what you show children do on screen or what, but it definitely felt as if it was cut short.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a tight film that gets its message across while remaining an engaging, entertaining thriller. DiCaprio and Hounsou were at their very best in each scene.</p></body></html>

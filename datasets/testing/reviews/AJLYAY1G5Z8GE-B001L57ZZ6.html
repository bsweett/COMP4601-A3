<meta name="summary" content="Nice story and full of action"></head><body><p>Original and entertaining. This movie tells you that we should not give computers more artificial intelligence that will make them eventually independent and make decisions on their own, or else they might try controlling our lives. The story is a little similar to the matrix in that aspect.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this movie is the way Eagle Eye was destroyed. It was too easy.</p></body></html>

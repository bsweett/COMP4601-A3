Aeon Flux has the action, thought-provoking storyline and unique unfolding plot that kept drawing me into the film. Acting is top-notch, storyline is complex and fun to follow, and the action and special effects are superb. An excellent cast, twisting plot and even costumes will interest you until the very end. Well worth the watch.</p></body></html>

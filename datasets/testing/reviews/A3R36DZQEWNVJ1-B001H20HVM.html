<meta name="summary" content="Saw 2 is a perfect movie that meshes together with the original..... but life fades out somewhere down the line"></head><body><p>In the original Saw, The Jigsaw Killer locked Dr. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell and chained there feet up in a murky bathroom with a dead guy in the middle of the room and the only way the can get out is to saw threw their feet..well, Elwes sawed threw his leg and the dead guy in the center just so happened to be the Jigsaw Killer. Now, in Saw 2, Det. Donnie Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher, Ransom) is on the case of the Jigsaw Man with Det. Dina Meyer (Stranger Than Fiction, Starship Troopers) and the swat team at his side as they finally capture the Jigsaw Killer, played by Tobin Bell (The Firm. Malice) who is dying of cancer. Wahlberg finds out that there are several people in a room locked up with no way out and they are breathing in a deadly nerve agent that destroys your insides and if they dont make it in time, solve the puzzles, then their all going to die. Once they escape the room, they go on a frantic spree around the house looking for ways to get out and Donnie Wahlberg is trying to get Jigsaw Killer to tell him where the people are because one of those people is his son. A perfect companion movie to the original Saw meshes well with it, notably towards the end. Wahlberg gets some credit for delivering a good performance and Tobin Bell is wonderfully creepy as The Jigsaw Killer. Fans of the first or really major horror buff fans will love the new traps that are set in the movie...with bloody effect...they love their blood those horror junkies. Some energy gets drained here and there but what keeps it alive is the ending. Also starring Franky G (The Italian Job, Wonderland), Glenn Plummer (South Central, Speed), Beverly Mitchell (Tv's 7th Heaven), Shawnee Smith (Tv's Becker), Eric Knudsen (The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio), Tony Nappo (Land of the Dead, Four Brothers), Tim Burd (Resident EvilApocalypse) and Emmanuelle Vaugier (Cerberus). Leigh Whannel who played Adam in the first Saw, cowrote with the directors of both films</p></body></html>

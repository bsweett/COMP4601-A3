<meta name="summary" content="An exciting epic that may not be for everyone"></head><body><p>Just like Tom Cruise's weird celebrity escapades before the releases of War of the Worlds and Mission: Impossible III, Mel Gibson and his film Apocalypto wasn't immune to controversy. A big budget film using ancient language subtitles and not a single recognizable face in the bunch, many wondered if Gibson was off his rocker. While not given the large attention that the Passion of the Christ got, this is at least an enjoyable film that won't really change your life or do anything significant, but you'll have fun anyway...if you can stomach this kind of thing.<br /><br />Set during an unspecified date, we see a group of Mayans living in a remote village in the jungle. One day, a savage group attacks their camp and those that aren't killed are enslaved and traveled a great distance to a Mayan city where some are sold off and others are sacrificed. Among the captured is Jaguar Paw, a young man with a son and pregnant wife at home (she was hid during the initial attack). He manages to escape and he sets off back home while being chased by a group of warriors looking to have his head.<br /><br />The main issue (aside from the obvious religious stuff) with the Passion was the amount of violence it had. Some saw it as a representation of Jesus dying for your sins and if he was going to, he better go through hell to forgive everyone's while others saw the violence as gratuitious and almost quasi-sadistic. Unlike certain films with big violence such as Hostel, the violence here serves the story and is part of it rather than is the story. But still, when you see not one but 2 people getting their hearts ripped out than subsequently decapitated, you kinda go "hm, kinda excessive no?"<br /><br />The film is basically separated in 2: a more slower paced view of Mayan culture, complete with odd face paintings and scars. It's interesting although you can imagine how odd it looks to see sticks through people's noses. The second half though is essentially one big long chase through the jungle with Jungle Paw outrunning his captives and even turning the tables on them. We got many many scenes of him just running which could be a great advertisement for a new diet. ("Wanna lose weight fast? Do a Mel Gibson movie"). But instead of being a Michael Bay scene of just action for the sake of showing off effects and mayhem, this serves as a purpose as he has to get back to his wife who is due any minute and the fact that she is stuck in a hole and can easily drown should it rain doesn't help matters. Some enjoy both halves together while the majority will just look at the chase and go "cool dude!"<br /><br />While it won't go into the collective conscious that Passion of the Christ did, it's at least an enjoyable movie for those who like some emotion with their action.</p></body></html>

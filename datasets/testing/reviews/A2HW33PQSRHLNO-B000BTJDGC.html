"Emily Rose" is more an exercise on the ins and outs of religious faith within the framework of the American legal system than a horror movie, an interesting meditation on how belief in the metaphysical goes over in complicated situations like the tragic one depicted here. Having read about the actual case which really took place in Germany and did not for a second involve the Catholic Church, I thought it was a little distasteful that the director decided to suggest here and there that this might have been a real case of possession.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself goes, though, the meticulous construction and ill-fated plight of Emily Rose (Anneliese Michael) manages to entertain and even get a tad spooky here and there.  Needless to say, this only happens when the fictitious elements are added.  It is above all worth watching as a courtroom drama.  Tom Wilkinson is utterly forgettable as Father Moore and Jennifer Carpenter delivers a fairly convincing performance as Emily Rose in both her "normal" state and "possessed" state.<br /><br />Laura Linney and Campbell Scott, however, are phenomenal as two lawyers bent on both stealing the spotlight and proving each other wrong.  At times you really can't help but side with the prosecution, though, as Linney is clearly unprepared for the case despite her character's supposed voracious drive for victory.  How you could pull off an even tentative acquittal such as the one Moore receives at the end is beyond me in this particular case, but she manages it.<br /><br />For my part, I was not left with the desire to watch the film again and again.  Although the plotline was elaborate, coherent and gripping, I found the "exorcism" scenes ridiculously short and unconvincing.  What you are left with here is not a burning question as to whether Emily was really possessed or just epileptic, but tremendous pity for her psychological and physiological suffering.<br /><br />That said, this is worth watching.  Maybe some aspiring horror director will pick up on the good parts and make another actually frightening film about exorcism.</p></body></html>

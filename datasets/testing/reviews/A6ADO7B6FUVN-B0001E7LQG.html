<meta name="summary" content="Hard for old dog to learn how to trust and love..."></head><body><p>Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) is a 60-year-old businessman that likes to keep his women young as he is about to spend the weekend with Marin (Amanda Peet) at her parents family beach house.  The trip to the beach house leads Harry into a new phase of his life as he has a close encounter with death as he has a heart attack.  This phase opens doors to a new world for Harry as he discovers what he has been missing in his life, yet he is an old dog that has a hard time conforming to his new ideals.  Something's Gotta Give is an amusing film with serious undertones of love, trust, and age that is well-balanced by Meyers.</p></body></html>

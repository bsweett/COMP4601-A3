<meta name="summary" content="An Urban "Who-Done-It?" Tale!"></head><body><p>When four brothers go home to Detroit to bury their deceased foster mother, they find out her death was no accident.  They then search for the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice.  Director John Singleton brings together some high class talent to make this film work.  Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Tyrese Gibson and Andre Benjamin playing the brothers gives the movie substance.  They work together nicely as a unit.  Oscar nominee Terrance Howard gives a strong preformance in a supporting role as the police detective searching for clues.  The action sequences are stellar.  However, it does fall flat at times with the dialogue and plot.  Overall, its a good action film that I would recommend.</p></body></html>

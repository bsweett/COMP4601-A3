<meta name="summary" content="One of the first comic films to get it right"></head><body><p>Although I was very hesitant about a Bryan Singer-directed version of X-Men, this series is the first comic adaptation since Batman to be truely faithful to the comics.  And the great thing is that it makes for an excellent movie. As with Aliens and Godfather 2, the sequel is just as good, if not better than the original.  Wolverine's background is explored and the film endsw with an incredible climatic battle scene.  <p>Since I don't own the DVD yet, I can only speak for the quality of the film. But if X-Men 1.5 and the list of extra features is any indication, the DVD looks like an excellent product.</p></body></html>

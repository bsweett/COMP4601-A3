The acting is very convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of a particularly dysfunctional family on a mission: Their little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) has been chosen to be a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent contest. Her parents, Richard and Sheryl Hoover (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette) decide to indulge their daughter and take her to the show. Along for the ride, both literally and figuratively, are Sheryl's suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell) and Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin). Look also for Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who refuses to talk because he loves Nietzsche.<br /><br />Things aren't easy for the Hoover family. Richard's motivational "nine step" program won't sell and the family is losing practically all their money in the process; and Richard's father does heroin when nobody's looking just to get through the day. Dwayne wants to fly jets even after he discovers that he's colorblind; and Frank wallows in a type of self-pity depression because his male lover left him and he wasn't awarded the number one Proust scholar in the nation.<br /><br />Of all the characters, however, little Olive holds out the most hope. She's nervous but she really thinks she just might win the talent contest and be crowned Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />Will Olive be crowned Little Miss Sunshine? What happens after their ancient, rapidly decaying VW bus gets a broken clutch and a broken horn? Will they get to the contest in time? Will they all get there in the first place? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The cinematography is rather fine; I liked the scenes of the countryside as they traveled in their VW bus; and the scenes of the talent/beauty contest reflect good judgment. The choreography shines through in scenes where the little girls all compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a commentary by the directors and there is another commentary with both the screenwriter and the directors. There are four deleted ending scenes that also have optional commentary. In addition, one side of the DVD presents the movie in widescreen while the other side of the DVD presents the movie in full screen format. Impressive for a single DVD release!<br /><br />Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is fantastic entertainment. Funny at times, sad at times, the film never loses its focus. Some people may say that it tries too hard to please but I didn't pick up on that; I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The movie is rated R so I would caution parents not to let young children watch this movie.<br /><br />Great job, everyone!</p></body></html>

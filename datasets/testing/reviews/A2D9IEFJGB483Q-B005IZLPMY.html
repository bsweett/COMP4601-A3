<meta name="summary" content=""Let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage""></head><body><p>"There is something ludicrous in the idea of so educating a generation which is born to the Ogpu [State Police in the USSR] and the atomic bomb. Since it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker." (C. S. Lewis "On Three Ways of Writing For Children," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IUSIYM">On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature</a>, 39)<br /><br />The best part of this movie, hands down, is Steve Rodgers BEFORE the vita-ray treatment.<br /><br />Consider the 90-pound asthmatic Steve Rodgers. He is persistent. He wishes to honor the life and death of his father. And he understands appropriate deception. This is understandable and forgivable, considering his chicken-little body, and his lion's heart. These are all heroic qualities.<br /><br />Then consider two of the three tests he passes before the vita-ray/super soldier serum treatment. The first is intelligence. He solves the flag-pole problem and gets the girl. Rodgers is not "scientific smart" like Reed Richards (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9U8NW">Fantastic Four</a>) or Howard and Tony Stark (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UYV08E">Iron Man 2 (Single-Disc Edition)</a>). But he is shrewd, wily, and clever, like Samson (the riddles in Judges 14) and Hercules (the Twelve Labors were tests of brains as well as brawn). And he needed to pass "the brains" test before he became the New Hercules for the New World.<br /><br />The second test clinched the deal. Our 90-pound weakling was the first on the hand grenade. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). And his self-sacrifice was so instinctive! No thought, no doubt, no "refusal of the call," just quick action in the right direction.<br /><br />The last test was the one Samson failed, the test of chastity in the face of a buxom vixen. Forget Camelot's "Fie on Goodness," this is vintage Tennyson: "My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure." (Galahad).<br /><br />And I applaud  Marvel for both understanding their own property and also understanding the nature of heroism. Considering the abomination (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LM1456">The Incredible Hulk</a>) (pun intended) that have been many of the previous hero movies (they still can't get the Punisher right, nor Galactus for that matter), this one was a shot in the arm. And a vita-ray treatment, too.<br /><br />We have all become Captain America.</p></body></html>

He is a former Mexican Federale whose life is ruined by a drug lord (Steven Seagal, of course), hired by a corrupt senator and his underling (Robert De Niro and Jeff Fahey, respectively).  Pursued by a beautiful immigration agent (Jessica Alba) and a seductive but deadly freedom fighter (Michele Rodriguez), Machete must fight to save his honor--and the lives of his people.<br /><br />The performances are surprisingly strong throughout.  The film rests on Danny Trejo's broad, tattooed shoulders; fortunately, he IS Machete, with the tough attitude (and a surprising level of sensitivity) to carry out this role, even making it slightly more complex than it requires.  Seagal's Spanish is atrocious, but he is the embodiment of cool, even if he is far past his prime (I won't say his acting is good; it's Steven Seagal we're talking about, after all).  De Niro has made a lot of schlock lately, but he's clearly enjoying making a movie that's INTENTIONALLY campy.  Fahey oozes sleaze and cool; his slick-backed, gun-toting crime lord persona is arguably one of the better ones to grace the genre.  Alba and Rodriguez are both solid (Rodriguez usually is; for Alba, this is a pleasant surprise); it's nice to see female characters that avoid the typical eye-candy action role.<br /><br />MACHETE is basically Robert Rodriguez at his best: pulling no punches, taking nothing seriously, just having a grand, gory good time.  It's an action movie with no logical plot or plausible character development; it's a movie where Lindsay Lohan appears in a nun costume, for God's sake (all of the puns intended).  We've also got Cheech Marin as a gun-toting preacher ("God forgives; I don't"); Don Johnson as a murderous vigilante; and Tom Savini as a professional assassin.  We've got a script that is good for what it is (and that's all it's supposed to be); and the co-directing by Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis is frantic and fast-paced.  There are a few slow spots (hence the four stars) that hinder the movie, but ultimately, if you're a fan of grindhouse cinema (or just like a good, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred action thrill ride), MACHETE is a movie you will thoroughly enjoy.</p></body></html>

This film has some very graphic and intense scenes in it,certainly too much for most children and possibly a plot a little too sophistocated for most kids as well. Pan's Labyrinth follows our main character Ofilia who endulges in books of fairy tales and fantsy set against a historical background of civil war in Spain of 1944.Her expecting mother and her step father "El Capitan" as she refers to him and one of the servants Mercedes.Ofilia's mother is having a difficult pregnency and is driven out to the coutry to have her child in the presence and insistnce of her new husband.Ofilia discovers a Labyrinth on the property,and is later visited by a fairy that night who leads her through the Labyrinth where she meets Pan,or more commonly known as "the faun".There she learns(as told by Pan) that she is the living soul of a princess from a far away land that thrived long ago in an alternate universe.They have been waiting for her return since her leaving for earth and passing so long ago.There,Pan gives Ofilia three tasks to proove her returning and that she has not been corrupted, each task more dangerous and risky than the next. Her first is to retreive a special key, the next...an artifact guarded by a slumbering demon which she just barely escapes with her life from and the last is the sacrifice of an innocent,all to be done before the approaching full moon.Through all the twisits and turns of Pan's world intermingling with the struggles of reality,is Ofilia really the decendent of royality from a far away land,is Pan real or imaginary?If so...is what he is asking her to do for good or evil intentions?Ofilia's world clashes with the very real world of war and a very cruel and sadistic step father.Pan's Labryinth is a fairy tale as told in stories long ago from authors like "The Brother's Grimm". Three tasks, causes and consequences for being defiant, it all comes full circle. This is a fantastic film, excellent art and design,beautifully photograhed,told and directed to perfection by director Guliermo Del Torro.True this film is subtitled in Spanish, but it is done well. I struggle with subtitiles myself, but I could understand a good portion of this film even when I wasn't focussing on reading subtitiles so much.A dubbed version of this film would be horrifically insulting and really "take away" the magic of this film.So "suck it up" and deal with the Spanish subtitles.Good fantasy films are hard to come by, and there are really only an elite few out there that pass as good ones.Pan's Labyrinth however will go down as a classic in my opinion.Multiple nominations were given and awarded to this film,and for good reason and adding it to a DVD collection will only enrich it.</p></body></html>

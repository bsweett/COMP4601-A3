Groundhog's Day just happens to be her birthday and she loves this movie! A smart funny romantic comedy with Murry at his comedic best. The supporting cast is excellent and there are many classic lines to quote in this top drawer comedy. The DVD is a good transfer on the regular edition and it does have some OK extra material. This should be in everyone's collection.</p></body></html>

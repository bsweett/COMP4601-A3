Some reviewers approach this movie seriously as if it is a metaphor for something important. It's a good (not great) action movie with a sense of humor. Lighten up & be entertained.<br />  Briefly, something goes wrong in space. The five principals are over exposed to radiation causing them to mutate. Each aquires a super power. The villian, Victor von Doom (really) is turning into metal & aquiring magnetic powers. Jessica Alba, is Susan Storm can become invisible & create a force field. Reed, is the leader, a genius & has aquired extreme flexibility, i.e. "rubber man". He's in love with Susan & is basically a dork. Michael Chiklis is Ben, "the thing" is really built, has super-human strength & a wry sense of humor. Johnny Storm is Susan's younger brother & enjoys being the  "human torch" & learning how to fly. He is horny & juvenile. On that note, I don't agree with the PG-13 rating. This is a kid movie. Jessica strips down to her skivvies once but that is actually funny not erotic. She has to take her clothes off because they do not become invisible. You don't see anything else because she is ah... invisible. Reed works in a lab to return them back to normal. Von Doom doesn't cooperate, as he enjoys his power & being a freak. So the good guys fight him & have adventures in New York City. They defeat him but don't kill him. He is merely neutralized to reappear, in the sequel of course. It's not as good as Spiderman or Batman but it's not trying to be. It's just what you see & no more & that's okay.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful fantasy for all ages"></head><body><p>World War II is raging, bombs are falling on London, and children are being evacuated to the safety of the country.  The four Pevensie children, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy, are sent to live in a big house owned by an old professor.  One day they discover an old wardrobe in the attic...that just happens to be the portal to the magical kingdom of Narnia.  There, it is always winter, but never Christmas, thanks to the evil White Witch.  Opposing her is King Aslan, mighty lion and defender of all that is good.  The children must gather all their courage as they prepare for the final battle between the two sides.<br /><br />Almost everyone and everything we see is CGI, which is stunning!  The four children are natural and convincing. The first half of the story is very slow but the huge finale is worth the wait.  CGI Aslan is such a  sympathetic creature that there were few dry eyes in the theatre during his big scene,  and the Christian allegory is quite touching.  This is a very satisfying film for Narnia fans of all ages.  (Note:  Be sure and stay for the end credits to see a final scene with Lucy and the Professor.)<br /><br />Kona</p></body></html>

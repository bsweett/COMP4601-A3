Even though only 80 minutes long, Farrell was on screen almost the whole time, and the range of emotions displayed is awesome.  There's an Oscar waiting for him in the near future.  Kiefer Sutherland as the voice/sniper was also great, malignant in his self righteous judging of other people.  Joel Schumacher's direction was excellent; with such a stagnant setting such as the phone booth, he manages to keep us riveted to our seats, wondering when the next shot will come.  Other than Forest Whitaker as the chief of police in a fine solid performance, the rest of the cast is basically supportive.  Radha Mitchell is good as Kelly, Farrell's wife; John Enos III as the pimp Leon is pretty decent; and Katie Holmes is always pretty to look at, though she doesn't have that much to do.<br />This is one of those movies that got battered for whatever reason; I think it's a top notch thriller.  I recommend it.</p></body></html>

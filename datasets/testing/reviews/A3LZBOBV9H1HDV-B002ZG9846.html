<meta name="summary" content=""Kick-Ass" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"Kick-Ass" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Dave Lizewski, a comic-book fanboy, decides to take his obsession as inspiration to become a real-life superhero. As any good superhero would, he chooses a new name -- Kick-Ass -- assembles a suit and mask to wear, and gets to work fighting crime. There's only one problem standing in his way: Kick-Ass has absolutely no superpowers. His life is forever changed as he inspires a subculture of copy cats, is hunted by assorted violent and unpleasant characters, and meets up with a pair of crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old sword-wielding dynamo, Hit Girl and her father, Big Daddy.<br /><br />The cast led by Aaron Johnson (as Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass), Christopher Mintz-Plasse (as Chris D'Amico / Red Mist), Mark Strong (as Frank D'Amico), and in standout performances, Chloe Moretz (as Mindy Macready / Hit Girl) & Nicolas Cage (as Damon Macready / Big Daddy) is great! The directing by Matthew Vaughn (also wrote the screenplay and produced) (who also directed "Layer Cake" (2004, also produced) & "Stardust" (2007, also wrote the screenplay and produced), he also produced "Snatch" (2000), "Harry Brown" (2010) & "Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels" (1998) is great! The screenplay (based on the comic book by Mark Millar & John Romita Jr., both also executive produced) by Vaughn & Jane Goldman (also co-produced) (who also did the screenplay to "Stardust") is great!<br /><br />The music by Marius De Vries, Ilan Eshkeri (who also did the music to "Layer Cake", "Stardust" & "Hannibal Rising" (2007), Henry Jackman (who also did the music to "Monsters Vs.

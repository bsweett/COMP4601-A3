<meta name="summary" content="a great classic film"></head><body><p>This would be a wonderful film for parents to watch with children old enough to understand the depth of its message. Good and evil are clearly drawn, and the values of justice and humanity portrayed with rare and memorable strength.<br />Reading Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel had a huge impact on me as a teenager...I never forgot, as Atticus says to Scout, that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.<p>Horton Foote won an Oscar for his screenplay, which is so faithful to the book. Set in depression era Alabama, it's seen through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, beautifully played by Mary Badham, and the sensitivity of director Mulligan's vision is remarkable.<p>Prejudice is the theme that runs through the story, from the harrowing court case of Tom (an amazing performance by Brock Peters), falsely accused of rape, to the demonization of Boo  (played by Robert Duvall, in his screen debut...he's intensely moving as this innocent and silent man).<br />Russell Harlan's superb cinematography should be seen in the widescreen version to be fully appreciated, and Elmer Bernstein's Americana style score adds so much to the film.<p>Gregory Peck's Oscar winning performance is magnificent. His Atticus is a hero of immense proportions, with compassion, integrity, and humility...and it's one of the many reasons I think this powerful classic deserves to be in every video library.</p></body></html>

And you do it up sort of like the original and sort of exactly opposite the original.  What do I mean?<p>The action largely takes place in a shopping mall, just like the original film.  The characters must learn to live there and make it their home.  So that makes it "sort of like the original".  However, it is there that the similarities end.  In the original film, we had the sense of time passing, that the characters had been there a long time.  In this remake, that isn't the case.  You don't know if they've been there one day or one year.  No mention is ever made.  In the original, there was an emotional reaction to the horrors going on outside.  In the remake, there is but a brief moment where Sarah Polley has a slight cry and that's pretty much it - no one talks about it ever again.  It's as if zombies are something of a pain in the neck and the loss of the character's families is never discussed.<p>Now, how is it exactly the opposite of the original?  In the original the zombies were slow, lumbering creatures obviously suffering from rigamortis.  In the remake, they are lightning quick - even one morbidly obese who, in life, could never have been that quick.<p>In the original, we had the false new society (the characters set up in the mall) breached by the bikers thus allowing the zombies into their midst.  In the sequel its one of their own going outside who does the trick.  This works.  However, there is a single problem with it.  The remaining plot hinges on a stray dog.  A dog that in the course of apparent hours they have trained to perform an action that would quite obviously take days or months even under the best of conditions.<p>Now, granted, I'm not the target audience for this film.  I was the target audience of the first film when it was released in 1979 (actually I was underaged back then).  But, curiosity got the best of me so I wanted to see this one.  Oh, it's gory and it's scary - in a "jump out at you" sort of way.  This may be a GenYer's Dawn of the Dead, but it isn't mine.  It's definitely got a lot more action and moves a lot faster than the original, but I'll take story to action any day of the week.</p></body></html>

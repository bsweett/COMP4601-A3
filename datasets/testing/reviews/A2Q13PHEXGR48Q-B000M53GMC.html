<meta name="summary" content="The Greatest Bond adventure"></head><body><p>Goldfinger is the greatest of all the James Bond series and the third one starring Sean Connery.  The story is about a supervillain attempting to steal all the gold from Fort Knox, or so we think.  007 must try and prevent the gold heist as he battles henchmen, lasers, and survives a good car chase.  The setting of Bluegrass, Kentucky may not seem very glamorous, but somehow it succeeds in this story.  This is pure Bond throughout with several gorgeous leading ladies and plenty of the usual wittisisms.  As Goldfinger puts it," Choose your next wittisism carefully, Mr. Bond. It may be your last." Everything is here in this classic.  Great villain, exciting action, awesome theme song, beautiful Bond girl, and the famous Aston Martin.<p> What else can I say about Sean Connery that hasn't been said already?  He is and always will be the perfect James Bond.  Gert Frobe stars as Auric Goldfinger, the supervillain bent on owning all the world's gold.  Honor Blackman plays Pussy Galore, the Bond girl whose allegiance we aren't sure of.  Harold Sakata steals the show as Oddjob with his devilish little smile and razor sharp derby hat.  All the parts in this movie are played to perfection and could not be any better.  The Special Edition DVD is well worth the price with several interesting documentaries, plenty of trailers and TV spots, widescreen presentation included and the film looks better than ever.  Any Bond fan must have this in their collection.  Go out and buy this fabulous James Bond classic!</p></body></html>

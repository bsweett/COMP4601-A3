Some musical numbers are really quite awesome such as "We Both Reached for the Gun" and "Mr. Cellophane." But as I watched the film, it became clear that the producer was a man. Some of the costumes were quite bondage-looking, and the dance numbers were quite sexual and provocative. The director misses no opportunities to flash a bit of skin and I'm reminded a bit of the 'women in prison' sexploitation films from the seventies. =-/ Bleh.<br /><br />Still, this is a light-hearted glossy film with some great dance numbers and a few catchy tunes. Well worth the time and expense, even if I found the style a trifle exploitive and the plot glossing over such serious subjects as prison, murder, and spousal abuse a trifle disturbing.</p></body></html>

Just a REALLY strange piece of animation.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />The soundtrack is fascinating.  In fact it might be one of the best soundtracks to an animated film ever.  It's seriously THAT good.  Okay, Dumbo probably wins the award for best ever soundtrack, but Coraline is definitely a runner-up.<br /><br />The music seriously reminds me of the mid 70's Canterbury scene involving progressive rock bands such as Hatfield and the North, Caravan and the Soft Machine.  Plus it's entirely melodic and just perfect.  I absolutely LOVE it.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty good too, though incredibly simple and adventurous.  Just how a storyline *should* be.  A young girl bored out of her mind because her parents are too busy to spend time with her goes on an adventure of a lifetime right in her own home (by going back and forth through a secret doorway in the wall).<br /><br />On the other side of the wall lies mirror images of her parents, but with buttons for eyes!  I kid you not, haha.  It's kind of scary in a way, but not intentionally so.<br /><br />Overall, the atmosphere is definitely eerie, and the quiet tone of the entire movie might take a few minutes to adjust to, but in the end Coraline is a quality film for children and adults alike.</p></body></html>

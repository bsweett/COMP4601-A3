Such gross exploitation of the terrible deeds of Aileen Wuornos makes one queasy in the stomach.  Arrested in 1991 and executed in 2002, Aileen Wuornos was not the first female serial killer in the world, or the first woman executed for murder in the U.S., but she was the U.S.'s first female serial killer.  A highway prostitute who killed only men, she was a scary looking woman whose simmering rage was visible in photos of her staring dark brown eyes.<br /><br />Monster was written and directed by Patty Jenkins, who says in the DVD featurette that she was just "showing what she sees," and would let people make up their own minds.  But unlike an objective journalist armed only with the facts, Jenkins writes a fictionalized script with made-up characters and events.  Although Aileen killed around seven men, we see only four killings in the film.  In the film, people treat her with horrible cruelty, for example a job counselor who says she can only get factory work, but there is none, and a lawyer at a firm where Aileen goes seeking work as a secretary.  It seems unrealistic that everyone would have been so vicious to a woman seeking a job.  That said, Monster is still worth a viewing or two.<br /><br />Charlize Theron worked hard to play the killer Wuornos.  Her performance is like watching the real thing.  Every muscle in her face, every minute expression, conveys more than words ever could (which is good, considering the weakness of the script).  In the film, the Monster has a lot of humanity.  It has just gone unrecognized, which is incredibly tragic and moving.  Christina Ricci plays her girlfriend, Selby.  Bruce Dern plays a Vietnam vet who is Aileen's only friend.  He gives a great performance. I love me some Bruce Dern!<br /><br />The score by BT is perfect- but never played!  Most of the movie plays with no music!  And when there is music, it is barely audible over the speaking.  Memorable shots and lines I can count on one hand.  The most striking photography shows Wuornos resting under an overpass, as cars pass by.  I would have used these shots a lot more.  Monster is really more like a made for TV/Lifetime movie than a large film production.<br /><br />Monster ends strongly.  The last phone call between Wuornos and her girlfriend was very well done and had the most emotional impact of any scene in the film. At the end of the movie, I cried despite saying I would never cry for this murderer.  But I cried for this wasted life, this abandoned soul, and for other abandoned souls out there, looking for survival and for love.</p></body></html>

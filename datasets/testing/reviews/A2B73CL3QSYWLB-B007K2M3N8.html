He doesn't look like Bobby Darin.  His film was more of a personal ego trip than a bio-pic of Darin.  To that I say hogwash.  Spacey invests all his energy and the fibre of his being to convince us that Bobby Darin was a great American artist.  Now I was too young to remember Bobby Darin in his prime except for a summer TV variety show he had around 1973.  I'm also not an afficienado of nightclub performers but through Spacey's persuasive direction he has me convinced that Darin elevated this type of performing to an art form.  Spacey also has gathered a talented group of supporting performers of whom Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee stood out for me.  She gave depth to a woman who most people would dismiss as Gidget.  It's my understanding that prior to her recent passing that she approved of this film.  If any film deserves to find it's audience this one is it.  Let's be grateful for home video and cable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick at his overrated best"></head><body><p>The late director Stanley Kubrick was an unqualified visual genius.  Few film makers neither rivaled nor equaled his ability to fill an entire movie screen with information pertinent to the narrative structure of a film.<br /><br />Like Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Fritz Lang, the mature Steven Spielberg, the young Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese and Akira Kurosawa, Kubrick uses the elements of lighting, depth of field, action, composition, design, staging and sound to create motion pictures that breathe as living organisms, completely transcendent to the manufactured world of a blackened movie theatre. He will be sorely missed.<p>That said, Stanley Kubrick is also quite possibly also the most grossly overrated, pretentious and narcissistic filmmaker of the modern era. While his most famous pictures, "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange", are filled with magnificent technical advances and stunning visuals, they lack the humor, the insight and the pessimistic optimism (he loves paradoxes in his films) of his real masterpieces "The Killing", "Paths of Glory", "Lolita", "Dr. Strangelove"  and the sadly overlooked "Barry Lyndon".<br /> Which finally leads us to the much anticipated "Eyes Wide Shut" .<p>For anyone who has been in a bomb shelter since the Cuban Missile Crisis, Shut  features the real life husband and wife team of Nichole Kidman and Tom Cruise as a couple who share way too much in the way of intimate secrets.  <p>Driven by nothing more than a jealous fantasy, Cruise undertakes a journey into the sexual underworld of New York's cultural elite. The film unfolds very much like a nightmarish adult version of The Wizard of Oz  (one character even taunts Cruise to come with her "Over the Rainbow.") Kidman's hilarious closing line is a crude rewriting of "There is no place like home."<p>Crouching in the middle of the film like an ominous gargoyle-like  specter is one of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed. Straight out of Heironymous Bosch and filled with hideously masked writhing bodies, cryptic chanting, cloaked figures and demonic organ music, Kubrick makes Cruise's descent into perceived decadence complete. It is one of the most vivid portraits of Hell on Earth ever filmed. That sequence chills and haunts me to the bone still.<p>Besides the "hell" sequence, the film does contain much to reccomend it.  Kidman's performance is Oscar worthy in it's quite torment and grace. She is an actor of that most rare combination: talent, beauty and endless range. Hers is a career that will last. <p>The production design stunningly recreates New York on a London Sound Stage.<p>And of course at the center of it all is the film magician Kubrick, who does create a film of stunning visual power. It just isn't particularly entertaining or enlightening.<p>Which leads me to the final questions about the film. What is the point of it all? Is it a calculated warning to anyone thinking of wandering away from home and hearth? Are we the viewer supposed to identify with Cruise who is attracted by the promise of sensual delights, but leaves stunned by the growing evil? Or is it an excuse to film as Kubrick himself once said " A first class nudie film."? Who knows? Who cares?<p>Although deliberate ambiguity can serve as an effective device- one that can inspire hours of meaningful debate, it all to often represents in Kubrick's world, a muddled point of view. Such is the case with "Eyes Wide Shut".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>This is a great movie. Specially since it is a true story. I love true story movies. I also believe in god and demons. I find it interesting seeing what Emily Rose went threw. My heart goes out to her and all the pain she went threw. I love the strength she had to keep living her life in so much pain just to prove to people that the demons are real and are still out there.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie"></head><body><p>Clive Owen plays Theo, a man that has to help an illegal immigrant.  What he finds out is that this young woman is pregnant.  The first pregnancy in 18 years.  We don't find out exactly why women stopped being able to give birth but this movie does not explain a lot of things.  You would think it would go into what people are going through knowing that human life will not exist soon.  Well it doesn't show you that because you can imagine what people are going through with 18 years of no childbirth, and the women crying at the beginning of the movie because of their fascination of the youngest person in the world being dead explains enough.  Don't expect this futuristic world to have space ships and all kinds of imaginative new technology, expecting anything but grimness will only lead to dissapointment.<br /><br />The explosions were by far my favorite part of the movie.  Though set 20 years in the future, it is as good of a depiction you will ever get of guns and their devastating effects.  As commented before there are some parts where the director does not say cut after explosions go off.  Be prepared for some of the most amazing realistic action scenes you will ever see.<br /><br />Michael Caine was very funny in his limited role and his friend Sid is just as hilarious.  The whole cast was very good.  Don't go into this expecting it to be a great movie but it is quite good and may surprise you.</p></body></html>

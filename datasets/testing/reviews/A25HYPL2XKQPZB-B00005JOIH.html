<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's take on the Munich Olympic tragedy"></head><body><p>If Munich was just a Hollywood movie about a group of guys out to kill every member of a group of terrorists responsible for killing their friends, then this movie of revenge would had had so much more potential.  As it is, it is based on the true story of Islamic terrorists from a group Black September that take the Israeli Olympic team hostage at the 1972 Olympic games and kill 9 of them in a resulting rescue attempt. The Israeli Mossad creates a covert team to kill in secrecy every single person responsible from Black September responsible for that attack.<br /><br />When Stephen Spielberg decided to make a movie based on the events of Munich, that instantly created a lot of expectations. I expect that a majority of Americans, regardless of political affiliation, see that what the Mossad did as justified. To make a movie about the Munich events and turn it into a celebration of what the Mossad did, a revenge flick, might have been the popular thing to do. I personally believe Israel had every right to retalliate the way it did, and believe the Palestinians deserved the fate they got in this movie. But I'm not naive to believe the Palestinians don't have a complaint about how they've been treated at times.<br /><br />So, I went into this movie knowing it had received bad reviews and some cited it as revisionist history or basically saying what the Mossad did was just as bad as what Black September did. First of all, the movie is long but extremely well made. The story moves swifly and the violence is brutal.  Eric Bana plays Avner, the Mossad agent assigned the task of killing the Black September members one by one. Avner accepts the task and begins working with his team, which includes future Bond Daniel Craig. They buy information and carry out the executions. There are problems at times and the group must deal with faulty equipment and collateral damage.  But the ultimate villian they must face is the fact that just as they are hunting, they are now being hunted. Soon, they realize they must be on the lookout for attacks against them. At the same time, the weight of what they are doing begins to eat away at Avner's core. The killings are changing him, and they are keeping him away from his wife and newborn child.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the true events of the Munich retalliation to comment on whether or not this movie got the historical facts correct. I do know many commented that the movie was a statement on the USA's current war on terror. Maybe that is correct, but Israel's been fighting the war on terror for years. I think Munich made points not for the benefit of today's Iraq war, but to show that what people assume is true now, was also true then. For one example, the point is made that when a member of Black September is killed, he is just replaced by someone else. So, what good does it do to kill one if a new one will take its place. This is a point to consider, but the movie never really takes a side. This is a movie really about a man, Avner, played excellently by Eric Bana. He eagerly fulfills his duty to his country, but the weight of his actions ultimately are too much for him to handle.<br /><br />In conclusion, you won't be able to watch this movie without giving at least some thought the the history behind it as well as the current situation in Iraq.  That being said, I think you'll be able to enjoy this movie regardless of your political beliefs.</p></body></html>

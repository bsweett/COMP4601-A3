I saw the unrated version thinking this will be scary. That is not the case in this movie. It is quite boring at times and a let down from the original. By the end of the movie, you are sick of seeing so much fog, which actually looked like smoke to me. I think the only reason this film might be popular as a rental is the fact that Tom Welling from the show Smallville is one of the main characters in this film. There were a couple of scenes that made me say "cool" but other than that, this remake needs to be remade! I'd suggest renting...... not buying this movie if you are curious.</p></body></html>

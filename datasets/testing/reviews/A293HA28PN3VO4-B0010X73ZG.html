<meta name="summary" content="Fun throwback spooky flick, nice B&W bonus"></head><body><p>Since I am a big fan of John Carpenter (who is given homage at the beginning of the character has a painting of "The Thing" poster), I was excited to give this a rent a few months ago, and ultimately add the Blu-Ray to my collection.<br /><br />There are of course similarities to such old school movies as "The Fog" and "The Birds" (the scene where Marcia Gay Harden starts her religious rant, definitely must have been a tribute to the scene in "The Birds" where Melanie Daniels slaps the other woman to come to her senses).<br /><br />The plot itself is borrowed from many other movies, where government experiments are to be faulted for outbreaks, plagues, irresponsible human testing etc etc etc, but the overall story, of being trapped in that situation, and not being able to go more than 30 ft, without getting devoured by the unseen-well that never gets old!<br /><br />I favored the Black and White version, because the colors and shadows were more pronounced, but both versions were a fun ride. I had hoped for a different ending, where everone does not get shot, but I have to admit, it added extra terror and sympathy for the lead character. I enjoyed the scene where the big creature crosses in front of the car. I realize the CGI was not touted to be particularly advanced but that scene actually had an existential feel to it. The combination of the creature's sounds and the awe at its might, was effective.<br /><br />Overall the acting was very exaggerated, but I wonder if the film makers didn't intend it be a little tongue in cheek. I'll need to watch the extras to find out. PQ/AQ 4/5, as the picture was a little soft in parts,and the sound not quite as powerful as I thought.<br /><br />This movie is a good time, and worthwhile for fans of the genre!</p></body></html>

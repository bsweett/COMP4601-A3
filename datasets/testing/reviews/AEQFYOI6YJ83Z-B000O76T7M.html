<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining popcorn flick"></head><body><p>Let's face it, folks: there's no way this movie could be perfect.  Even the basic premise of the flick--bringing together two of cinema's most beloved extraterrestrial villains--is bound to fail on some level.  Doesn't mean the movie isn't entertaining, though.  The special effects are astounding (the aliens have never looked so alive, the predators never so...predatory).  And there's the guilty-pleasure of seeing the insectile creatures that took on Sigourney Weaver fighting the humanoid monstrocities that almost killed Danny Glover and the Governor of California (and DID kill the former Governor of Montana).<br /><br />The acting isn't always up to par, though Lance Henrisken sinks his teeth into his minor role (as always), and Sanaa Lathan makes her stereotypically-shallow role at least watchable.  The script leaves a lot to be desired, and there are plot points that got left out (due to the studio, from what I've heard, though I can't prove a thing).  All these negative things might make you thing you're in for a bumpy ride...and you are.  The GOOD kind of bumps.  This one isn't scary, no, but it's entertaining, and that's all it has to be, in my opinion.  A good entertaining movie that you won't mind seeing again sometime down the road.</p></body></html>

It looked like it would've been a decent crime thriller or something of that sort, but, boy, was I wrong. Law Abiding Citizen, in fact, is a pretty good movie filled with heavy amounts of ethical and moral quandaries, metaphorical allusions to how people are responsible for their own actions, and is an eerie testament to the legal system's flaws and shortcomings. I was actually reminded a lot of The Count of Monte Cristo in how a man just loses everything, gets cheated by the system, and in about ten years time amasses a fortune to plan out this giant, masterful revenge plot against all those embedded within that system and those whom he feels have wronged both himself and the rest of society. Well, it's not as epic as the Dumas classic, but if the writers did, indeed, use it as some kind of inspiration, bravo. The thing that fascinates me the most about this film is the tension. Once you see the traumatic event that triggers Butler's character and the way he's unjustly justified through court (in a city that ironically prides itself on "justice"), how can you blame the guy for going off the deep end and putting all this chaos into action? On top of that, I've yet to even mention the predicament of the law versus vigilantism. By now, I'm sure we've all seen some example or another of how operating outside "the system" can also be thoroughly more effective than the papers and red tape of the law, or at least that's the message I get from the ending. However, in the process I feel the movie also loses quite a bit of steam when certain plot points are revealed toward the end. I also feel that there isn't enough "change" to the system itself, so much as it is for just one person. Maybe it's to illustrate the futility of how the system can't be changed and how it continues to suck, or maybe they just wanted us to get the message that revenge isn't all it's cut up to be?<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen is brought to us by Starz / Anchor Bay in 1080p using the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.39). This is the first Starz / AB Blu-ray I've ever watched, so I wasn't sure what I was getting. But to tell you the truth, it's not so bad. The film's gritty nature reflects well in the photography, which leads to a darker color palette that more or less is as vibrant as it can be. Black levels, however, are excellent with darkness and shadows being the highlight of the presentation. Contrast is also surprisingly good given the amount of dimly-lit scenes. The only faults I have are with a little loss in texture and detail in some of the closeup shots and a few instances of debris popping up here and there, which is really weird considering most recent films usually have none.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Despite all the dialogue, the movie also is very proficient with its TrueHD 5.1 track. The dialogue is clear and free of any anomalies, and surround usage is fairly immersive during prison and other facility takes. However, the real workout comes in the bigger action sequences and through various parts of Brian Tyler's score. High/low ends are deadly accurate for the cemetery scene, with LFEs exceeding my expectations for explosions. The score is fairly quiet when need be for certain parts of the movie, but when things start getting crazy, I feel it really helps establish a good mood for the fast pace. I wouldn't quite call this a reference disc, though, as a few parts of the movie didn't feel as engaging as I thought they'd be, but this is an excellent first-time listen for me.<br /><br />Extras - 3.0<br /><br />There's a commentary, two main bits about legal terminology and filming, a graphics progression bit, and a bunch of trailers. The legal terminology feature was what I found most interesting. It basically breaks down the logic and reasoning behind the decisions made at the beginning of the movie, as analyzed and explained by two former Philadelphia attorneys, and makes a lot of sense. The filming feature was a short, though unorganized, look at how they shot certain scenes, came up with ideas for the writing, and so on. It was interesting on a few parts, but not as detailed as I expected. I would've liked a more in-depth interview with director F. Gary Gray about the plot.<br /><br />Overall - 4.0<br /><br />The movie makes for some great, great drama, exploitation of the legal system, and "what if" dilemmas. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit of a downer in that it feels "too easy" and kind of loses the overall point of trying evoke change within "the system." But a large majority of the movie is still very good and very tense. Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx aren't on screen together a whole lot of the time, but it makes for a cool battle of wits when they do. With excellent A/V presentation and a decent set of extras, Law Abiding Citizen comes highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An OK Sequel, but its just more of the same...."></head><body><p>To begin with, I had mixed feelings about the first Hostel film. That film had its moments, but overall, I wasn't so sure that it was all that great. So I really didn't know how well I would receive this sequel. And overall, I  have lukewarm feelings about this one as well. The movie picks up exactly where the last one left off, and the first minutes of the film are good, but after that, the basic story is really the same as the first movie, except this one involves 3 females, rather than males. Three American girls who are studying abroad, are persuaded by a newly acquainted girl to go on a spa vacation in Slovakia. And though there is a little more back story about this "torture club", and how it works and who runs it, there's still not many new twists from that of the first Hostel. Like I said, the first few minutes of the film, in which Jay Hernandez reprises his role as the only survivor of the first film, are quite good. But after that sequence ends, the film returns to a slow pace, and really nothing much happens until the last half of the movie. I think that this film lacks some of the suspense and mystery that the first Hostel had, simply because the viewer knows what's going on. In the first film, the audience wasn't sure what was happening, who the bad guys were, or why they were torturing innocent people. Now, with all these questions pretty much being answered, the viewer mostly knows what's gonna happen. Yes, there are a few little twists, one of which I don't fully buy in to. I won't spoil it for the ones that haven't seen the film, but there is an almost complete "role reversal' between two characters, which I thought was way too quick, and it seems too contrived in an attempt to be clever. The ending of the film would have been good, if not for the very stupid "soccer" game that breaks out between the kids at the last minute! And speaking of kids, I have to tip my hat to this film for at least not holding back. Yes, there is a death of a child shown in this film, and I have to give credit to any film that has the balls to do something like that. As far as other death scenes and the blood/gore content, its pretty good. There's an excellent (if who can use this word to describe things like this!) and a quite realistic castration scene which I thought was pretty graphic. However, I feel there was less torture in this film than the first Hostel, and the killings came to quick most of the time. All in all, I think this film isn't as good as the first one. It pretty much uses the same blueprint as the first film, where it doesn't start getting really good until the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. Only this time, you already know what's going on. For this reason, I don't feel this sequel is as good as the first film. However, as a stand alone movie, its still pretty good. But I wouldn't buy it brand new unless its got a cheap price tag to go along with it.</p></body></html>

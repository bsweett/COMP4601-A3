As much as I am a lover of gory horror films (not to say this isn't gory), but I also like psychological horror films like Silent Hill. This is more on the lines of a psychological horror film, but it commits the cardinal sin of cinema; IT'S BORING. When I saw this film I was even willing to forgive the director, William Friedkin. Why? To tell you the truth, I hated The Exorcist. Sure it had its creepy moments, but it was so unbelievably boring. I found Bug to be far more entertaining, but it was still weighed down by boredom. Unfortunately this film just boils down to a hidden message; Never have sexual intercourse without protection. Or the more likely message would be don't have sexual intercourse with a crazy schizophrenic man.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A woman named Agnes (What a horrible name for a woman) is a waitress living in a motel room hiding from her abusive ex-husband. Agnes is a chain-smoking, drug-using, middle-aged, wannabe lesbian woman struggling with her guilt of losing her son years ago. Then a man named Peter her female lover brings along to her motel room stays with her and they grow closer together and then make love one night and then later that night is when they start to see the "bugs." Slowly but surely Agnes begins going insane with Peter and they both become convinced that bugs are attacking them and that the military experimented on Peter and they're after him.<br />MUSIC: Rarely appears, and when it does it's not good.<br />ACTION: This film has nice gore touches and you get somewhat of idea of the couple's insanity. There is some tension to be had throughout the film, but unfortunately this film is mostly focused on boring dialogue. This film starts off slow and never picks up steam until the ending.<br />ACTING: The actors were good, but unfortunately they were given almost nothing but boring dialogue. Overall they were very professional and talented, but the very long-winded dialogue dragged this film down.<br />OVERALL: Cautionary rental. There are great ideas here that are sadly not used to their potential. You must be a person who does not get easily bored, if you're not you will hate this film.<br />THE GOOD: The gore, the ending, and the actors.<br />THE BAD: The music and horrendously long-winded dialogue.</p></body></html>

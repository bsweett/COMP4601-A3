I was pleasantly surprized!  Yes, it has its share of typical martial arts action (i.e. people flying, walking on water, doing unbelievable stunts, etc.), but it is all tied together by a story line that makes sense and even causes the viewer to think afterward.  The film started a little slow, then quietly hooked me before I realized I was watching something with substance.  If it were not for the slow start I would invite friends over to see this film and discuss it.<br /><br />Now, for a tough question, is it better for a people to be bound together by even a bad government than for everyone to have the freedom to be a law unto themselves?  We see the question everywhere around us . . .<br /><br />1 Roman Catholic Church or 34,000 Protestant Churches?<br /><br />1 evil dictator or multiple warring tribes?<br /><br />Federal rights or States' rights?<br /><br />Should Taiwan and Hong Kong exist apart from China?<br /><br />Watch the film, then decide.</p></body></html>

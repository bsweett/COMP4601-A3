Not that some loved it and some hated it... but the same person would come out with both reactions in the space of a sentence. That's phenomenal power, people. That's what filmmaking at its best is all  about-- the ability to elucidate and confuse at the same time. And the best  part, the true knock on Hollywood? That an indie film company stocked  with rock and roll stars made this sucker on a shoestring with the kinds of  starpower normally reserved for Hollywood's biggest nine-figure  blockbusters and it's still been one of the nation's top ten films every  week since the listening public discovered it. I know people who've seen  this as many times as they've seen Rocky Horror. I figured it was time.  (And I had free passes and couldn't use them to see Toy Story 2.)  <p><p>It's hard to say word one about this movie without giving away major  pleasant surprises. Everyone knows, of course, that Malkovich plays himself  (and hams it up tremedously), and most people are aware that the male lead  is John Cusack. The rest of the film's cast is a mystery, I think. It was  to me, anyway. And when they popped the name of the female lead up on the  screen, not only had I not recognized her throughout the movie, but I tried  to figure out who she played... and I got it wrong. Wow. Suffice to say the  casting is stellar, you know almost everyone, and they had to have worked  for scale. And they're all brilliant. <p><p>One extra little sidelight--  the puppeteering in this movie is tremendous. If you go in for avant-garde  productions and all that sort of stuff, the incredible complexity of the  marionette shows at various times during this film will astound you. The  puppeteer's name was flashed at the end, but I missed it. Remember this  guy, if and when you see this movie, 'cause if anyone ever makes it big in  marionettes, it'll be him. <p><p>The plot is, um, simple-- an out-of-work  puppeteer (Cusack) gets a job as a filing clerk, falls in love with a  co-worker (he's married and they're on the verge of on-the-rocks) who snubs  him repeatedly, and discovers in his office a door that opens into a portal  which allows the person entering it to get inside the head of John  Malkovich (portrayed by himself) for fifteen minutes. After being voided  from Malkovich, one is unceremoniously dumped into a ditch on the New  Jersey Turnpike-- a beautiful metaphor if I've ever seen one. The plot  can't get any more twisted? Hold your tongue! Of course, I can't _tell_ you  more about it without giving it away... you just gotta go. <p><p>The film  was produced by R. E. M. vocalist Michael Stipe and is the full-length  directorial debut of music video guru Spike Jonze, perhaps best known for  his longtime association with the Beastie Boys. Whatever you may think of  their music, you have to admit, their videos are always something new and  unexpected. As is this film. It's twisted, it's mean, it's ugly, at times  it's funny as hell. It's two hours of sheer, utter, complete enjoyment...  but you walk out feeling guilty for having enjoyed it as much as you did.  Go. See it now. Laugh. Everyone else will feel more guilty about it than  you will.</p></body></html>

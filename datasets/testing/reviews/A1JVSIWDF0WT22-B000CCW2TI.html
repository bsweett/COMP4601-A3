<meta name="summary" content="MORE THAN DECENT THRILLER"></head><body><p>This movie feels like a 2 hour episode of 24. What makes it really worthy are the excelent performances by Murphy (very creepy !) and the wonderful, Rachel MacAdams. Only minor complaint is (spoiler ahead), why did the latter try so hard to evade the police when the plane lands instead of simply surrendering ?<br /><br />The movie came out at the same time than Fligth plan which caused some confusion on the people sitting beside me a the theater (when is Jodie Foster going to appear ?)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The horrors of war on display"></head><body><p>This really is a phenomenal achievement by Eastwood, presenting an objective look at the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe once again has such a commanding presence, like he did in The Last Samurai.  Here he plays General Kuribayashi, a wise commander whose unconventional methods causes much dissension down throughout the ranks.<br /><br />What I found stunning with this character was his past relationship with America.  He had lived in America, had many close American friends, and had a genuine respect and admiration for the country he was forced to fight against.  He also knew the insurmountable odds stacked against him in this battle but was ready to die with honor for his country.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima really depicts the emotional hardships that come with any war.  Plus it has wonderful character development that really gives you no choice but to connect with soldiers on both sides.  It also spends the vast majority of time focusing on the war itself, which is another reason why I found this movie much more profound and enjoyable than Flags of our Fathers.<br /><br />Eastwood explicitly demonstrates that when it comes to war, there is no right or wrong, good or bad, fair or unfair...<br /><br />There is only death.</p></body></html>

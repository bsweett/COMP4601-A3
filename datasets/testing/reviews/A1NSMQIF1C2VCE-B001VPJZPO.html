<meta name="summary" content="Wonderfully creepy, if not terribly surprising"></head><body><p>Although the big surprise twist isn't that much of one, The Skeleton Key is still a very entertaining and stylish supernatural thriller, with an all-star cast, wonderfully spooky scoring and great directing like they aren't supposed to do any more. And what's more, it gets the difference between voodoo and hoodoo right.<br /><br />Kate Hudson and especially John Hurt absolutely sell the story, and the entire conceit of hoodoo not being dangerous unless you believe it teases viewers not to believe.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of supernatural thrillers like the Serpent and the Rainbow, the Ring and the Sixth Sense.</p></body></html>

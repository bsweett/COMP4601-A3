That IS NOT here in SHREK THE THIRD. The comedy and script now seem cheap and lame.As an adult with no kids,IMO, this was the worst SHREK yet. I waited until I could see this at a "second run" cinema for $3. I am glad that was all I spent.Kids may like this one, but as an adult....ZILCH! If there is a SHREK 4, the writers better get on the stick!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kung Fu Hustle  4 stars !"></head><body><p>Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie.It's very creative and comparable to a superhero movie.Some actors in the movie hold powerful martial art skills.It adds great comedy that's very orignal and even includes dances on a couple scenes.All I have to say is I liked it , good effects "for the most part" and entertaining to watch.<br />If you like Kung Fu movies then pick up or rent Ong-Bak :The Thai Warrior".</p></body></html>

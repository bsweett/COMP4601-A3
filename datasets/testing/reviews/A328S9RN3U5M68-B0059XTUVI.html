Despite the great performance by Meryl Streep portraying the larger than life Margaret Thatcher, one of the most important political players of the 20th century, the story remains spotty and unsatisfying despite evidence that it is trying so very hard. Abi Morgan is responsible for the screenplay that does indeed offer individual scenes with touch moments but lets the overall sweep of the film in tatters.  Phyllida Law directs.<br /><br />For reference, `Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, PC, FRS, n&eacute;e Roberts (born 13 October 1925) is a British politician and the longest-serving (1979-1990) British prime minister of the 20th century, and the only woman ever to have held the post. A Soviet journalist nicknamed her the "Iron Lady", which later became associated with her uncompromising policies. As prime minister, she implemented conservative policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.'  Where the film take us is to view Thatcher (Meryl Streep) as elderly and a virtual prisoner in her own home due to her concerned staff and daughter Carol (Olivia Colman). She looks back on her life as she clears out her late husband Denis's (Jim Broadbent) clothes for the Oxfam shop. Denis is seen as being her rock as she first enters parliament and then runs for the leadership of the Conservative Party, culminating in her eventual premeireship. Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margaret's life forever.<br /><br />Streep's ability to convey the mental deterioration of this lady is a triumph of moderation: she never imitates Alzheimer's disease but instead allows us to view senility in a new way. The cast is large and there are some good performances by some of England's finest actors.  But somehow the events during Thatcher's rise to the role as England's first woman Prime Minister and all the events (Falkland war, fall of the Berlin wall, etc) just seem like addenda.  Even the usual fine music composer Thomas Newman fails in his task to create a memorable score (except for the inclusion of Maria Callas singing `Casta diva' from Bellini's `Norma' and excerpts of Bach from the Well Tempered Clavier). It is a showcase for Meryl Streep and she handles her end of the project well indeed.  Grady Harp, April 12</p></body></html>

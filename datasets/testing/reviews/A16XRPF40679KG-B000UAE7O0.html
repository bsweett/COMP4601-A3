<meta name="summary" content="scratchless is better"></head><body><p>One thing this whole grindhouse thing forgot is that when I buy real grindhouse movies on dvd I want them to find the best print available. For instance 'death carries a cane' from 1971 looks as scratched up as they these were made to look and then someone put out with a great print remastered in austria. I ditched my scratched up one and bought the newer one.  Why?  because films don't start out that way. And when I saw grindhouse movies at the drive in or a cheap theater back when they  didn't start out trashed often. They wore them down sure but I would go to them when they first came out.  However the spirit of those 70's and 80's grinders is alive in the movies themselves for sure and for that I love them. I could have done without the scratches and I was grateful to get the scratchfree nagative print , it's so much better than the scratched up one although the machete trailer is not on that option it's still on the other regular option so you can laugh at that one still. Of course low budget gh stuff is unintentially funny and this movie captures the whole experience completely. Low budget horror is like this no film critic would ever give most horror more than a few stars so I put them in their own five star ratings how good is a low budget film in regards to others of it's type?  Anyways this movie is alot of fun and laced with humour of purpose whereas most gh was dead on serious (but funny sometimes because it's so over the top)  unlike lets say giallo movies which is like gh but more slasher and was huge during the 70's too. Anyways this blu ray version shines and I am glad I got it and if you are a fan of gh get it. Or even if you look down on gh films get it because it's wild and funny and could fit right in with any drive in movie of that lost era.  The blu ray has extras galore on two discs and is well worth owning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Funny Movie !"></head><body><p>I just had a blast watching "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang".<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is so funny as the actor who pretends to be detective. And Val Kilmer is perfect as Gay Perry. I think its the best role he has ever done.<br /><br />These two actors made the perfect team !<br /><br />The Screenplay and writing are fast paced, and comical. The writers know just when to really go over the top. Some of the scenes made me laugh harder than I have at any movie in a long time.<br /><br />Very rarely do I enjoy dark humor. And very rarely do I see a movie twice. But I enjoyed this film so much, I am thinking of going back and seeing it again. It was that funny.</p></body></html>

There are some amazing things in it, but there are some incredibly dull ones as well.<br /><br />Like all of Danny Boyle's films, there is some truly astonishing imagery in this film.  The shots of Mumbai's slums are brilliantly shot (the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, deservedly won an Oscar for his work).  Boyle and company deserve kudos for these scenes, as they are rarely seen in feature filmmaking, and are hardly ever seen in contemporary Bollywood films.  There is also a scene where the children go to an opera, and steal wallets and purses from under the bleachers.  This scene is achingly beautiful, and I wish it was longer.  There are many shots like that in this film.  Boyle has always had an amazing eye, especially in Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.  But too often Boyle dazzles us with eye candy, and his films end up being unrelenting hollow, and Slumdog Millionare is no exception.<br /><br />The script of this film is predictable and, especially in the 2nd half of the film, surprisingly boring.  There is a love story at the heart of the film, and it feels forced, like it doesn't belong there, like the filmmakers insisted that it have some sort of love story in it, like typical Bollywood films do.  The dialogue is very forgettable, and the characters (except for Dev Patel's character) are cartoonish and very one note.  Boyle's array of dazzling images suddenly disappears in the 2nd half when he concentrates on the love story, and he's left with just the story, which is very uncompelling, even though it should be.  The motivation of the TV host is also strange, as it doesn't make any real sense other than to give the story an unnecessary twist.<br /><br />Most of the performances are adequate, but the best one is by Dev Patel.  While he has the classic Bollywood look, you do believe that his character was raised in the slums, and he has a certain anger and sadness that makes you feel for him.  One of the most fascinating things about this film is the jarring (intentionally) juxaposition between Patel's interrogation (he's tortured by the police rather brutally), Patel's life in the slums (which is all done in flashback), and the slick, hollowness of the TV show Who Wants to be a Millionare?.  It works very well, but it's predominantly in the first half, and the 2nd half is much more conventional and quite staid by comparison.<br /><br />The musical score is quite good, especially the end credits song/dance, which is one of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />I think this is another Best Picture Oscar winner that people will question in future years.  Too often the Oscars is not about which is really the best film of the year, but about politics (like great directors like Scorsese winning for mediocre films like The Departed instead of winning for Goodfellas, a true masterpiece), and/or momentum (Slumdog Millionare's wins were all about having momentum and riding a tide, so to speak).  It's not a bad movie at all, but it really is not a fantastic film by any stretch of the imagination.  I would say it's definitely worth seeing, but it isn't a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

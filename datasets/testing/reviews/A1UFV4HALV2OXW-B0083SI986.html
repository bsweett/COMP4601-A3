<meta name="summary" content="Stirring film."></head><body><p>Recently widowed Walt Kowalski is a tough, bad tempered retired autoworker who is estranged from just about everyone in his life. Other than his deceased wife Dorothy, Walt's only other source of affection is his 1972 Gran Torino.<br /><br />Despite Walt's stubborn efforts, his old neighborhood is in decline and under siege by a group of young Hmong thugs. A failed attempt by his neighbor Thao to steal the Gran Torino unwittingly brings Thao and Walt together. Led by his articulate and bright sister Sue, Thao must make amends by working for Walt. This leads somewhat predictably to a friendship. It is, however, the consequences of that friendship that creates the tension and drama of the movie. Clint Eastwood stars and directs this stirring film.</p></body></html>

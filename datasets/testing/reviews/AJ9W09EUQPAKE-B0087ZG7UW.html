<meta name="summary" content="A boy's best friend is his mother"></head><body><p>A slick, taught psychological thriller. Seminal cinema. I had avoided watching this film for a long time after a friend of mine told me it was 'kind of obvious who the killer is'. Well yes and no. From the cautious, careful opening scenes, to the moment the mysterious motel/house location is established, it is clear that this is not the type of billion dollar bloodbath slasher thriller with ludicrous twists, turns, subplots, denouments. It is a closed world - dominated by the disturbed young man Norman Bates: quirky, uneasy, boyishly handsome - and his relationship with his elderly invalid mother who dominates his mind.<br /><br />Original for its shape (the shower scene is only a third of the way through) and its intelligent and brilliant epilogue of psychological ideas after a thrilling seat clutching climax, Psycho is a must.</p></body></html>

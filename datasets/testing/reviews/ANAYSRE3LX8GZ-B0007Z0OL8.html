<meta name="summary" content="Team America, F*** YEAH!"></head><body><p>Well, South Park has gone Thunderbirds in this puppet comedy by Trey Parker. Team America are an already established group of freedom fighters who are fighting terrorisim around the world, and new recruit "whats his face" is having some trouble adjusting.<br /><br />Much like the original Thunderbirds series, this is a bit of a poke at a few movies, Thunderbirds / Star Wars I picked up on easily, theres probably more.<br /><br />The movie like I said is a lot like South Park, even the same SP voices are heard all through the film. I have to say, I expected Trey and Matt to come up with somethign absolutly hilarious with this film. Sure, it did have a great speach at the end, and a funny love making scene with 2 of the puppets, but I truely think they couldve made it a much funnier movie, cause at times, it was...well, almost like a serios movie!!! I dont know if thats a compliment or insult to Trey?!<br /><br />Overall, it's an ok film, I hope when it's on DVD there is tonnes of bonus features that will get my thumbs up to buy.<br /><br />======<br /><br />Update: 7th June 2005<br /><br />I've just watched TA on DVD and it looks and sounds great. I kind of missed the point that it was meant to be an action film more then comedy, so i guess i was in a state of miss interpreting on my first reveiw. The movie is fun, but I still find it a 3 and half star comedy. I understand now that it had a huge production and wasnt the easiest of films to make, but i do agree with something Trey and Matt say in the bonus features, it was definitly time to make a movie that didnt use CGI and go back to an old school process, and i couldnt agree more.<br /><br />The extras are a bunch of featurettes, ranging from storyboaring, intervewis, behind the scenes etc, plus the usual trailers, and some deleted scenes that arnt hard to work out why they where cut out. But i'm a bit disapointed, I thought Try and Matt would have some ideas for hilarious extras, like interveiws with the puppets, or an actual deleted Jabba The Hut scene that Trey is always going on about as a joke whenever he can. And i'm very suprised there is no audio commentary.<br /><br />Still a good movie to own, gonnah be interesting watching it from now on and looking for little props made of things lying around the house!</p></body></html>

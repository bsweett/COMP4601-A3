It stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as two brothers who fight sorcery and various supernatural elements. The film is full of amusing characters and delightfully unexpected visual turns. For those that appreciate their fantasy/horror with imaginative, and over the top humour (Pirates of the Carribbean, Evil Dead 2) then this might suit their taste.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks great and there are a few extra features including deleted scenes, audio commentary with the director, and a short feature on the special effects seen in the film with views by Terry Gilliam.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Hitchcock...."></head><body><p>Vertigo is one of the most compelling films ever created. Hitchcock is somehow able to create intrigue just by watching. The camera becomes a voyeur following Kim Novak around as we take immediate identification with the James Stewart character.<br /><br />I always feel completely absorbed by this movie no matter how many times I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone - and would place it among my favorite films of all time.</p></body></html>

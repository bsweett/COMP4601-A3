The story, with its gruesome underpinnings, is  essentially a subtle and growing relationship between two lost souls, one  good and one very, very bad.  I thought that Demme's direction of this film  was masterful, and gave you a exciting tour-de-force into the complexity  and intrigue of forensic detective work, while never letting go of the many  jumps, thrills and twists.  Anthony Hopkins, whose Hannibal Lecter has  become a mainstay of popular culture, is seductive and mesmerizing; the  close-up scenes between him and Jodie Foster are electrifyingly real and  yet still have that big-screen, knock-out quality you want in a big movie.  Jodie Foster shines in a role that she was born to play: a loner, a person  with intense psychological scars, a young woman who wants and desperately  needs respect and validation.  I just loved this movie, and have seen it  several times. By the way, Scott Glenn is wonderfully sparse in a role that  could have been showy.  Not for the squeamish.</p></body></html>

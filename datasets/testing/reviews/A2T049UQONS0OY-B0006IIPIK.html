<meta name="summary" content="Three and one half stars"></head><body><p>Here's a science fiction film with three big stars constructed in the now common digital approach, meaning none of the sets are "real" and that the entire backdrop to the film was built by computers and/or blue screens.<br /><br />This film combines the modern technicque with nostalgia (it is set in 1930s New York) with danger and adventure in every scene to show what happens when a group of giant robots invades New York. The plot focuses on air ace Sky Captain (Jude Law) and his relationship with intrepid reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) who eventually globetrot in efforts to track down and eliminate the robotic menace and its creator.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has a role as a hotshot space captain in the back half of the movie and  character actor Giovanni Ribisi, whom you may remember starting out as a relative on the TV series "Friends", also has a supporting role.<br /><br />None of the stars are taxed by their roles because this movie is basically a cartoon on celluloid. The plot has some excitement but overplays its hand after an hour, when its intricacies are too many and you lose interest. The digital production creates a dark film noorish background completely unsuitable for sci-fi, where we are supposed to be able to see everyone and everything with crystal clarity.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this flick after seeing the ending a couple times on digital cable. But after sitting through the entire hour and 38 mintues, I wouldn't recommend you spend much money on it. A rental, maybe; a purchase, out of the question. With its star power and sci-fi adventure plot, I thought this  would be a fun night that could perhaps be repeated a couple times. As it turned out, I lost interest completely after an hour.</p></body></html>

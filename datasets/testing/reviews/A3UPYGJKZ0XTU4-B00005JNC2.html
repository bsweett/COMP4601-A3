<meta name="summary" content="Quirky Gen-Y Tale of Love and Self-Discovery."></head><body><p>"Garden State" is a quirky Generation-Y love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral after a 9-year absence. Overmedicated since he was 10 years old by his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm) for problems that may never have existed, Andrew decides to go without his meds for the trip. He catches up with old high school friends and meets an eccentric, talkative woman named Samantha (Natalie Portman) whose unusual ways of coping with her own problems might be the perfect match for him.<br /><br />"Garden State" is one of those films that is populated with idiosyncratic characters. Fortunately, most of them are not written over the top or overplayed. Peter Sarsgaard is almost too good an actor for his role as Andrew's old friend, Mark. It's nice to see him, but his performance begs for a meatier role. Jean Smart has a couple of good scenes as Mark's mother. Ian Holm mostly creates an impression, rather than a character, as Andrew's father, because he has so little to do. This supporting cast is so impressive that it left me feeling that their talent had been underutilized. But Zach Braff's Andrew and Natalie Portman's Samantha (Sam) are the film's focus. Andrew is a quiet, introverted, slightly dweeby man who tends to view life from the outside looking in. Sam has so many eccentricities that it stretched credibility and became a little annoying. I found her childlike nature to be particularly odd and unlikely -or, if not unlikely, at least unattractive. The character is a mish-mash of too many things and would benefit from some paring down. But "Garden State" belongs to the genre of "quirky love stories", and that is what it delivers. Many of the film's best moments are found in its absurdist humor. The love story is sweet. And the characters are distinctive.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a making-of documentary, outtakes/bloopers, a "Soundtrack Promo Spot", and 2 audio commentaries. "The Making of Garden State" (27 minutes) is a loosely organized documentary that features short interviews with the film's producers, cast, principal crew, and even the craft service guy. I can't say that its very informative. There is more information on making the film in the audio commentaries. The first audio commentary is by writer/director/actor Zach Braff and actress Natalie Portman. It primarily discusses filming from the point of view of an actor or a director dealing with actors, not technical aspects of filming. The second audio commentary is by Zach Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein, and production designer Judy Becker. Discussion of the technical aspects of filming are in this commentary. Both commentaries are casual but interesting, without long lulls between remarks. If you listen to only one, I recommend the second, technical, commentary, which is a little more engaging and substantive. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

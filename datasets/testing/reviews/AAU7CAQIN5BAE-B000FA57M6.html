<meta name="summary" content="oh this was so painful to watch"></head><body><p>oh dear this was truly one of the worst movie going experiences of my life. let's take this into consideration, since the masses of unintellectuals will think this is: "dude this was the sickest movie ever, it was so amazing, just like the videogame man." No, really it wasn't.<br /><br />1. 'Doom' series is out of this world gaming experience. I think the masses will agree on that. That is why they made the game into a movie. Duh.<br /><br />2. The Rock = Disaster in any genre.<br /><br />3. One of the most painful experiences of my movie going life. It was like adults who have never acted before got together to shoot their own movie, with some 'ok' special effects. Stan Winston this wasn't.<br /><br />4. THIS WAS NOT TERRIFYING. This was not scary. It is supposed to be Scary, it is supposed to be REALLY, really scary. Remember how terrifying Doom 3 was, I mean honestly. The music, the bloodstained walls, the smears of matter and inards on the walls. I really didn't get that in the film. I mean how could anyone?<br /><br />5. Put Arnold in The Rock's role and a great supporting staff and it could have racked in more loot and been much more belivable from the video game transfer to live action.<br /><br />5. Please buy the movie for the satisfaction of destroying it with a sledgehammer afterwards, it's really that bad. I wont have it anywhere near my sci-fi collection.<br /><br />The Rock ruined the movie, he has no perceptual understanding of any technique, Meisner or the like. He really is an awful actor, which added to the total bombardment of this truly sickening film. What a waste, what a farse. I am truly dissapointed. And no true sci-fi or video game to film fanatic, could possibly think this was anything less than a C film.(take Silent Hill for example in comparison to Doom; brilliant!)</p></body></html>

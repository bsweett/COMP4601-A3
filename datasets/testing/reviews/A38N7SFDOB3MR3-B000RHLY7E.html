The gang of rejects were so twisted and malformed that they were to be not only hated, but likable. To help play this card along, the sheriff that was tracking the killers turned into a reject himself. I suppose this was an attempt to reveal some deep pseudo-intellectual philosophy about how we're all rejects at heart, or maybe not. Honestly, I don't care. The movie wasn't cool. In fact, it tried so hard to be something, that it became nothing. Are you smelling my drift? I thought so.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was hit and miss. Some of the actors did an amazing job. Sid Haig was outstanding as Captain Spalding, and the Unholy 2 (which included Diamond Dallas Page) were good as well. But most of the acting was horrendous. Sherry Moon captured on film one of the worst acting performances in recent memory. Every line she spoke sounded forced and aweful. Leslie Easterbrook was nearly as bad, but her main flaw was over-acting.<br /><br />With so many good horror movies on the shelves, I would recommend Wolf's Creek or High Tension. Rob Zombie tried real hard to be cool. He should have tried real hard to make a movie. I really felt the shadow of an aged rock star in this movie; a rock star that is trying so hard to remain cool that they become a caricature of themselves. This movie is like a caricature of a horror movie.<br /><br />I have read that this movie isn't "trying to be a horror movie." Who cares. Instead of "trying" to be something, it should have treid to entertain. Horror movie or not, it was forgettable.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 34<br /><br />20 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

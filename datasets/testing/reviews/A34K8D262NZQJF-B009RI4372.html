<meta name="summary" content="Woo-Hoo I finally got my hands on this one!"></head><body><p>This is a really really fun movie and I have watched it for the sixth time already cause it's that good! First off remember that you will probably find this movie in the Horror sections and that is very true! This is a horror movie but I like the fact that the directors of the film realized that they had a really cool location to film a creepy style B-Movie and used all of the advantages that came to them after deciding to make this masterpiece. Anyways you should watch this movie cause it's a nice slice of Americana and how creativity can be limited and still have an astounding effect on the audience.</p></body></html>

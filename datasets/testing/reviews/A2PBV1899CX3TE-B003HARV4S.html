<meta name="summary" content="A Grand Illusion"></head><body><p>The movie evoked turn of the century Vienna, all sepia toned and mist shrouded. Edward Norton plays a charasmatic magician who forms a childhood bond with a young duchess. Paul Giamatti plays a police inspector, who starts off cynical and slimey, but becomes more sympathetic towards the end. Jessica Biel plays the duchess, and she is lovely to behold. She looks gorgeous, but even more attractive is a certain something, charm, charisma, warmth, she just seems like she would be very easy to fall in love with. The magical effects are very well done, and you are never sure if they are meant to be just clever tricks, or if the Illusionist is a mystic, able to conjure up ghosts from the other side... Rufus Sewell plays the evil prince, and he is a splendid villain, looking very much the dashing, yet evil prince, like something dreamed up by the Bronte sisters.</p></body></html>

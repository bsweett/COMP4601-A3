<meta name="summary" content="These &quot;Matches&quot; Cause A Small Flame"></head><body><p>Although the public responded moderately to this film (it grossed a little over 36 million), the critics sure did love this Ridley Scott (&quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;) con artist movie.<p> &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; has Nicolas Cage playing Roy Waller, a great con artist, but one messed up person. Waller is full of neuroses among his biggest problems is the fact he suffers from a major case of OCD.<p> &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; has a lot of plus sides to it. Cage, as most have already stated turns in a wonderful performance. He's alive and viberant. And it's a shame he didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, he's THAT good. Also Sam Rockwell does a nice job. The two have a lot of chemistry, both are fun to watch. As are some of the cons. Which really makes a movie like this. But, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; is playing around with a couple of ideas. One deals with Roy (Cage) and Frank Mercer (Rockwell) as a couple of con artist. The other deals with Roy as a man who makes Woody Allen seem tame. And the third story has Roy coming to realize he has a 14 year old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman). All of these outlines work well, at times, but the main problem I had with the film was the fact I was able to predict the ending. Any con moie you watch, you always know to expect a big twist at the end. That's just the way these films work. Watch Mamet films like &quot;Heist&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;, &quot;House of Games&quot; watch other movies like &quot;The Grifter&quot; and even the recent &quot;Confidence&quot;. So knowing that &quot;rule&quot; it was easy to guess what would happen. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; as I said does have its strong points but here's an odd case where a movie has a good execution but a so-so set-up. What I mean by that is the acting is fine, Scott's directing works, I liked the cinematography by John Mathieson, and at moments (mostly the first 45 minutes are so) the screenplay by Nicholas and Ted Griffin is enjoyable, but then the film becomes predictable. Or maybe it's predictable to a small number of people since film critic Roger Ebert openly said he did not see the ending coming. If he was lying or not I don't know.<p> So should you see this movie? Yes. I've named all of the film's appealing points. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; also keeps up Scott's winning record with me, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &amp; &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. This is a fun movie to watch, just remember, don't make the same mistake I did, and think about it too much. You'll spoil it for yourself.<p> Bottom-line: Entertaining con movie from Ridley Scott, that may not reach the level of other con films. Has strong performances from Cage, Rockwell, and Lohman. The only downfall to the movie is the predictable ending. Still worthwhile though.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Oliver Stone movie for non-Oliver Stone fans"></head><body><p>When Oliver Stone was announced as the director for this movie, I initially thought that Hollywood lost its mind.<br /><br />Although my friend and her family then living in New York ultimately fared okay, we knew many others had not been. I worried that Stone would use the appointment as an excuse to deliver a blood-thirsty jingoistic diatribe against 'terrorists'--ironically not much different than what Washington D.C. was dishing out--and was wary of the film.<br /><br />Stone surprised me and perhaps many other Americans by instead going in the exact opposite direction. This film provides a glimpse of that day and Americans capacity for helping each other out in a time of crisis.<br /><br />The film centers on John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and Michael Pe&ntilde;a (Will Jimeno), two Port Authority police officers who were among the first responders to the World Trade Center site. Faith and family sustain them as they realize they will also have to be rescued but wonder when.<br /><br />It also focuses on the tremendous emotional and psychological burdens their families endure in general and especially during that day. Stone wisely avoids his 'trademark' conspiracy in favor of just showing the heroism of these ordinary Americans and side-stepping politics. We don't even see the plane crash into the buildings.<br /><br />I also thought that Chuck Sereika, as an 'underdog' in this screenplay, is an interesting character. Before the attack he is a disgraced paramedic because his license to legally work is not current. However since 'all hands are needed on deck' during the day, he is actually among the people who rescue Jimeno and McLoughlin themselves on September 12th.<br /><br />The cinematography for this film is great--again considering the fantastic pressure everybody must have been under to make a one-dimensional title. The errors which do exist (there is a car model on the screen which was not made in 2001!) are minor and will not substantially detract from watching the story--both once and repeatedly. This is the account of 9/11 which Americans will actually like revisiting!<br /><br />Everybody CAN make a difference in this world!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The only redeeming feature is Predator's dreadlocks!"></head><body><p>What in the world is going on? Aliens crash burn in an isolated Colorado town--this isolation is so serendipitous as the viewer later learns. A hunky Predator comes after them. What saves this movie by a hair is P's dreads. He's a mighty machismo other-worldly being! Uh-uh-uuh! A charmer to be sure what with all the special weapons he continues to pull from his body-armored suit!<br /><br />Pity the poor pitiful people who happenstance come face to face with the Aliens or the Predator. I was hoping Predator alone would try to make the acquaintance of at least one human as his ally. Didn't happen. He "disappeared" all who crossed his path.<br /><br />As for those skittery Aliens, what gives there? Their birth cycle has racheted up several revolutions as Mom first "impregnates" a human, then Babies, make that plural, erupt--ka-powie! from their stomachs. Yoush! Sickening before with John Hurt, still sickening with little boys and women! They still do all that drippy stuff EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />The sheriff tries, heaven knows he tries, but he is just one mewling human against the ferocity of Aliens and a Predator. Then there are those teenagers who are so tough until they actually face the real bullies! Bye bye bravado, hello yellow!<br /><br />How all this ends is a shocker, but the only way. Maybe there will never ever EVER be another battle between Aliens and one Predator on this planet. If there is, maybe they will film with a little more light. It was too dark to tell who was losing or winning! Frankly, I favored the dude with the dreads. Go pity-pat, my heart!</p></body></html>

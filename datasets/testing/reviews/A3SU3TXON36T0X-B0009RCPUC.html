<meta name="summary" content="The Last Days of the Third Reich."></head><body><p>_Downfall_ is a film which depicts the last days of the Third Reich as Hitler and his cronies await their imminent doom in their bunker as the Russians invade Berlin.  Hitler is depicted by Bruno Ganz as suffering from Parkinsonianism and slowly losing his grip on reality, ranting and raving about the failure of the German people and the German generals and military as it becomes more and more apparent that he has lost the war.  The film is interesting in that it also shows a more personable side to Hitler, an ambiguous figure in the film, capable at once of kindness towards his secretaries and his dog but also great cruelty.  However, one also becomes aware of the ultimate failure of the Third Reich, as one sees how the cult of personality surrounding Hitler fails to serve the German people as innocent German civilians are slaughtered by the Red army.  Many of the most loyal in Hitler's regime choose to fight to the end and ultimately commit suicide (serving as would be martyrs of the National Socialist political religion).  Goring, Speer, and Himmler all ultimately opt to attempt to save their own lives by betraying Hitler.  Goebbels remains loyal to the end and he and his wife murder their own children, in the most sickening of manners, and then commit suicide because they cannot bear a world without National Socialism.  Eva Braun too remains loyal to Der Furher, opting to commit suicide with him by cyanide capsule after their marriage in the bunker.  (According to the film, Hitler's body was burned following his suicide so as to never be found by the invading Russians.  The film does not give credit to many of the various survival myths or alternative accounts of Hitler's last days.)  The movie speaks to the horrors of war, and also the cruelty of men, showing the insane cruelty of the Nazi regime and the SS, but also hinting at the equal cruelty of the Soviet army.  The movie also speaks to the dangers of fanaticism, showing the way in which many of Hitler's own men obediently followed his every order unto their very death.  It should be noted that Hitler had a lifelong fascination with suicide and that several of his former mistresses had committed suicide over him.  The unquestioning nature of Hitler's associates is particularly shocking to see depicted on film, although many would break with him and betray him, it becomes clear in the film who constituted the opportunists in the Nazi regime and who constituted the true believers.  Also, the conflict between Hitler and his generals and the military became very pronounced as Hitler ultimately turned his back on them and the German people but insisted at the same time that they never surrender.  I found this movie to be very disturbing, although no doubt a more accurate depiction of Hitler's ambiguous nature than much of the over-the-top pro-Allied propaganda.  While Hitler is depicted as clearly insane (or becoming insane) he is also clearly depicted as a human being and not merely a demon spawn conjured up from the pits of hell.  Ultimately however, while the Third Reich regime was a failure, its memory has lived on due both to its insane cruelty and to the role of war in shaping the Twentieth century.  This film provides an interesting account of those final days.</p></body></html>

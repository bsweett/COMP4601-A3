<meta name="summary" content="Excellent ingredients but weighed down by a cliched plot and unrelenting brutality"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson's "Apocalyto" follows one man's brutal journey in Mayan times from his quiet, peaceful village to hell and back again.<br /><br />The film has much going for it - excellent acting, makeup, costumes, production design, visual effects - which really makes you feel like you are there - but is let down by a cliched plot that contains a few too many coincidences.<br /><br />It is also extremely brutal and continues Gibson's obsession with human suffering following on from "Braveheart" and "The Passion of the Christ".</p></body></html>

"V for Vendetta" is not only more than relevant to the dark capitolist(New World Order)times we are living in right now,but it is also simply a perfect example of brilliant film making. If you watch this film & find any flaws your either a lieing non-film fan or a lieing right wing neo-con & it doesn't really matter then because your bogus opinion is irrelevant. For us true film fans though,this Two-disk Collector's Edition w/Mask & mini promo posters/goodies is what collecting films/dvd's is all about. Without a doubt the best collector's edition I have ever purchased! What an absolute treat!</p></body></html>

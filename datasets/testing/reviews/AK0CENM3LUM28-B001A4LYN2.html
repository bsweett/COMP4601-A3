I was genuinely looking forward to it, having heard how good it was and being a literary fan of Upton Sinclair, but neither myself nor my fiance thought this film was any good.<br /><br />I can't help but feel that someone needs to inform Hollywood that "long" does not equal "epic", and that a focused, meaningful short story is far more powerful than a long-winded, meandering plod to the three hour mark. Much of this movie feels like a desperate search for a meaning or point to hang its hat on, which is a shame because if Sinclair brought anything to his writing, it was a point, albeit an often propaganda-laden one. And, fundamentally, this movie doesn't seem to understand where it wants to go or what it wants to do with Sinclair's points - there are some shades of his pro-socialism message (such as when Plainview promises that the development of the oil derrick will be accompanied by the development of schools, irrigation systems, and other improvements to symbiotically aid the community) as well as some criticism against capitalism and religion as being means to control the working class, but the directors clearly aren't married to the ideas and the watered-down presentation and uncertain focus render the message confused and vestigial.<br /><br />Instead, the writers seemingly want to focus on the character of Daniel Plainview, but even this ends up inconsistent, as they cannot decide whether to portray Plainview as a decent but haunted man spiraling into madness or a charming, sociopathic murderer. Possibly this indecision is due to a desire for an amoral, enigmatic character, but without a driving plot or point, character development was the only thing left to carry this movie. Early on, there is a half-hearted attempt to personalize the capitalism vs. religion struggle into one between Plainview and Eli, the local preacher, but the attempt feels forced and unnatural - Eli is so cartoonishly ghoulish and evil that he feels more like a cardboard cut-out than a person and Plainview's character change between bemused acceptance and violent resistance occurs with an almost audible 'clunk' as though a switch were flipped. The result is less that Plainview feels like a sum of his tragic experiences and pain and more like an authorial insertion who is kind as required and murderous when not. Unfortunately, authorial insertion characters are not interesting because they tell us nothing about humanity (as they are driven by plot necessities, rather than realistic events or emotions).<br /><br />Ultimately, I can't help but feel that this movie was crippled by its own ambitions. With a little more polish and a lot of editing, I feel this movie could have worked in either of two ways - either with Daniel a kind man (rescuing his adoptive son, attempting to build up the community, etc.) who is broken by the betrayals around him (Eli the preacher, his fake brother, his son's radical behavioral changes) OR with Daniel as a complete sociopath (using his son to his advantage, murdering and cheating his partners, deceiving the community into believing they will receive more than he intends to deliver) who wreaks havoc in the lives around him, particularly his son. Unfortunately, the movie seems to want to have its cake and eat it too, and isn't willing to pick one direction and stick with it. Daniel is not a kind but wronged man as he begins the movie as ready and willing to cheat, deceive, and murder his way to the top as he is at the end of the movie; and while Daniel could easily be described as a sociopath in the movie's present state, the fact of his sociopathic nature doesn't drive the movie because it never actually tragically affects anyone - all the ancillary characters either deserve his bad treatment (Eli) or are the better for it in order to escape him (his son).<br /><br />A note about the score in this movie - we thought it was dreadful. I was shocked to see it in mentioned as a *positive* aspect of the movie. I, personally, do not think that the same strain of drumming or the same five notes on a violin repeated over and over and OVER again for 20 minutes is something a composer should be proud of, but to each his own, I guess.<br /><br />Based on what I've read of the other reviews, I think it's safe to hazard that if you're a fan of the director, you'll probably disagree with my review and enjoy the movie for your own reasons, and I respect that. I suppose, then, that this review is directed more to Sinclair fans and non enthusiasts as a warning that you may not find this lengthy movie to be as griping as advertised.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

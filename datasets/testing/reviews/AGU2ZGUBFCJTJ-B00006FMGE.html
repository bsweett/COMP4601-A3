The original film, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone, was met with huge hype and an enormous response from the movie-going public. The film broke almost every box office record in the book. Unfortunately those records didn't last long as they were quickly broken by the release of Spider-Man in May 2002. But could The Chamber of Secrets offer a threat to the famous web slinger? Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets hopes to follow in the foot steps of the original though it appears to be much darker then the first film. Hopes are that many of the fans won't be alienated by the change. But the question is whether the film can hold up better the original or will it show that the original was just a mere fluke and change is not good for the series?<p>The story focuses on Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the problems that ensue around the young wizard. Harry Potter has been spending the summer at his uncle and aunt's house and desires to return back to the school with his friends. But that may not be so easy. Apparently a house elf named Dobby has reason to believe that great danger will fall upon Mr. Potter if he returns, so he does everything he can to prevent Potter from returning to Hogwarts. When he is able to make it back to his school, strange things start happening. Harry begins to hear voices in the empty hallways, water begins flooding the halls, and Harry is able to communicate with snakes. Not only that but people have been found petrified and a rumor is spreading that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened once again. It is up to Harry and his group of friends to protect Hogwarts from impending danger within the school itself. The story for The Chamber of Secrets is much darker then the original Harry Potter but that is what makes it great. The darkness of the plot shows that the film makers are willing to make their films more mature as their audience gets older. The plot keeps the audience interested in every aspect of the movie despite the long time length.<p>A good amount of the cast from Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone reprise their roles in the second film. The acting within the film was much better then in the original film as many of the cast members have grown more into their roles and feel more comfortable, which is quite evident within the film. Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry Potter and once again he is fabulous in the role. He showcases a broad range of emotions within the film which is rarely seen in a film intended for children and does a much better job at showcasing his acting talent then he did in the original. Richard Harris, in his last major role in a motion picture, is wonderful once again as Professor Dumbledore. Harris is one of the greatest British actors that have ever appeared on screen and it is wonderful to see him go out in such a great way as in this role. There are too many roles within this film to mention each by name but the cast is very well put together and there were very few problems. The only problem was the character of Ronald Weasley. There was no problem with the person who played him but actions of the character itself. In the original film Ronald was sort of mixed character having both comic moments as well as serious ones but he has now been reduced to a comedic character, which is quite disappointing.<p>Overall, Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best movies of the year and goes beyond the expectations of a normal sequel. The magical world of Harry Potter is brought back to life better then ever before. Though the film is much darker then the original, that does seem to affect the overall effect of the series. The darker moments actually make the film feel more exciting and make the audience feel more connected to the characters and what happens to them. The film definitely matures with the audience the Harry Potter series seems to connect to but doesn't do so in such a dramatic way that some fans are alienated by rapid change. Though the film is near perfection, there are flaws to it. The running time of the picture, which stands at an amazing two hours and forty minutes, seems too long for a film intended for children though it did help tell the story better then if it had been edited down to a shorter time length. There were many amazing CG special effect sequences but not all the CGI was greatly appreciated. The character of Dobby the house elf is sure to be added to the most annoying CG character list for this year. He seemed fine for the plot of the film but for the most part, he was too annoying and distracting for the purpose of the story. Other then those problems, Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets definitely raises the bar not only for children films but for sequels as well. This film is a delightful film for all ages, though some precaution may be needed for the younger fans of Harry Potter as the film has several frightening moments. One of the few films out there that truly lives up to all the hype of the original and even goes beyond expectations.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Curtis Hanson does it again..."></head><body><p>I've never been crazy about Eminem, but he makes an auspicious debut with confidence and command. Curtis Hanson, director, has always paid great attention to detail (think &quot;L A Confidential&quot;) and, once again, uses Kim Basinger to good advantage. Eminem, indeed, had a tough role; to maintain his identity while taking care of his crazy mother, and showing genuine love for his little sister; then, to deal with a flaky girlfriend and a gang of Detroit &quot;Urbanites&quot; (for wont of a better word). His performance is complete. There's a terrific 2.35:1 Widescreen, showing all the craziness of the audiences, and the bleakness of the slums. Powerful! My only complaint is, at the beginning, the music overpowered the dialogue quite often. The Sound director got it together about half way through, but there were some important dialogues at the beginning that helped you to know what his problem was, and it required a bit of attention. Eminem's music appeals to many (he wrote ALL of the music), but I chose to buy it because some reliable friends told me how good it was as drama. Yes, it's good. It's also one of those &quot;David &amp; Goliath&quot; films, where the underdog makes good. I actually like those kinds of films. Eminem did a fine job; but can he do &quot;Hamlet&quot;? Keanu Reeves did.</p></body></html>

Some idiot lets a train loose and of course, its full of toxic chemicals, that can destroy much of a city. Then we have an evil business owner more concerned with money than peoples' lives so making it worse, a manager who is a white and also more concerned with money than people who makes it worse, a black woman and she is both a manager and a good guy and Denzel Washington, who is both the victim of this cruel business and the hero. In the meantime, we get a few hair raising scenes, nothing that seemed believable.<br /><br />The acting was reasonable. Chris Pine's character development was I thought bad while Denzel Washington, who is a good actor played well.<br /><br />I do like a good action movie but I think the story just let it down.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Clever, But Unneccesary Remake"></head><body><p>Why remake the cult classic John Carpenter urban western?  Because:<br /><br />  a) you can<br /><br />  b) it's there<br /><br />  c) why not?<br /><br />  d) all of the above<br /><br />If you answered 'd' then you are correct!!!!  A little slow at first, but the action heats up and lets face it, this film has a great cast.  It is hard for a filmmaker to build suspense and suprise with a remake, but there are some clever plot twists and loads and loads of action.  The language is harsh, even vulgar at times.  Ethan Hawke is food as always, but the real fun comes from Larry Fishbourne.  He is menacing yet at ease.  Another popcorn movie.  Sit back and enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You Down With OCD?  Oh Yeah That's Me!"></head><body><p>There's a lotta bruthas out there flakin an perpetratin but scared to kick reality.  This particular playa (Jack Nicholson) got the OCD chronic, yo.  But what interests this G is that one of the main symptoms of OCD is recurrent, abhorrent, anxiety-provoking thoughts of doing violence to those close to you - i.e. poppin a cap in your homies, though you think this sort of thing is to-the-curb.  Which is exactly what Jack Nicholson had going on in The Shining.  The intrusive unacceptable thoughts are what motivate the ritualistic behaviors.  In The Shining, Jack had the bad ideas, in As Good as it Gets, he's got the rituals.  If you could somehow combine these two movies in your mind, you'd get a complete picture of Nicholson's mental illness.</p></body></html>

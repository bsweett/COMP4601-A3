<meta name="summary" content="Oh, Baltimore!"></head><body><p>*Hairspray* is a fun and energetic musical!<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad is a plump teenager who can sing and dance.  Her dream is to land a coveted spot on "The Corny Collins Show".  With the help of her best friend, Penny, her dad and Seaweed, she does.<br /><br />However, she has to constantly fight and maintain her spot because she does not fit the typical mold of a teenager, figure-wise.  In addition, she's outspoken about segregation between the Whites and Blacks.  The pressure doesn't stop there.  She has to compete with Amber Von Tussle and her mother, the "beauty queens".<br /><br />Once again, wonderful musical surrounding the issues of racism and segregation.  Self-esteem too.  You'll laugh at John Travolta dragging as Tracy's mother.  You'll also be amazed at his performance.  And, if you'll pay attention, you'll catch a cameo appearance of Ricki Lake.<br /><br />If you're a fan of musicals, you'll definitely want to add this to your collection.</p></body></html>

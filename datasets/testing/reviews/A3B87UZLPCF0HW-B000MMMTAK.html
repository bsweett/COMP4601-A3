This is an acutely political piece of filmmaking that cleverly uses the guise of a dim-witted, if undeniably sweet character, to make some irrefutable points about the frame of mind of (some) American culture. That said, there's a point (in the film) where Borat wrestles his naked corpulent producer to the floor in a cringe-inducing scene that will have you both laughing and wincing in disbelief at the lengths that Cohen is willing to go to - and good God, laugh you will. This is simply one of the funniest films of the year.</p></body></html>

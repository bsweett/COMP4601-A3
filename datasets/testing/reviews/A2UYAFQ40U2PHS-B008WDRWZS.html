<meta name="summary" content="Thankfully, this was directed by Werner Herzog"></head><body><p>In the hands of another director (especially an American, "indie" director), this would have been a comedy.  There is a snideness that exists in "indie" films that mocks (rather severely) its characters.  They would have taken Timothy Treadwell and made him look like a fool with a snarky, snide attitude.  But Herzog isn't like that.  He treats Mr. Treadwell with a profound respect, and a genuine desire to understand him.  It's not a propaganda piece (Herzog shows that Timothy was a bit paranoid and had a dark streak), but Herzog shows respect for this man and his beliefs.  He also shows genuine sympathy towards him, like he was an outcast who could only fit in the Alaskan wilderness.  And kudos to Mr. Herzog for NOT playing the final recording of Timothy.  There would have been no reason for its inclusion, as it would add nothing except cheap shock value.  A lesser director would have made this recording (of Timothy being mauled to death by a bear) the centerpiece of his/her marketing campaign for the film.  This is a very reverential, respectful, and even spiritual film by Herzog, who is one of the greatest filmmakers ever.</p></body></html>

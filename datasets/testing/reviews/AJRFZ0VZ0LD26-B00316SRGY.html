<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood getting better as time goes by"></head><body><p>I always loved Clint Eastwood as actor, but once he started directing I understood the true power of this man.  So when "Gran Torino" came out, I knew I will have to see it.  This film is a work of genious on so many levels. It is setup in the working class Detroit that inevitably like most cities, keeps changing.  Eastwood's characted Walt Kowalski is no so keen and eager on adjusting.  It is the death of his wife and her funeral that break heart watching this growling man come to terms that the term "dysfunctional family" has a whole new meaning for his own.<br /><br />Alone, retired and left to his own devices, Walt is forced to accept his Hmong neighbours who in turn take care of him in their own way.  How can a man so full of bitterness, prejudices and contempt for the world around him adjust to this arrangment?  Well, you have to see the movie because it will break your heart.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is building his own legacy that will remain a legend on its own.  This is one of the best movies I have seen lately.</p></body></html>

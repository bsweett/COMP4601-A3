<meta name="summary" content="Good effects, mediocre story."></head><body><p>&quot;Twister&quot; is a success in many different ways, mainly due to the incredible use of special effects that went into its making. A movie about lots of big storms and at least five different tornadoes calls for some of the most sophisticated digital effects on the market, and on that basis, the movie delivers. The action is quite intense, and certain scenes call on some old-school clich&eacute;s that we'll all recall from past disaster films. In fact, the only place in which the movie fails is its story, despite a very talented cast. <p>I would say that it started a revolution in the movies of today: nowadays, moviemakers seem to think that the bigger the effects, the better the movie, regardless of characterization or story. This is definitely the case with such movies as &quot;Volcano&quot; and &quot;Armageddon,&quot; and there are movies that seem to get the formula for effects and story evened out, but rarely. In this case, &quot;Twister&quot; is more about the special effects show than about anything else. <p>Beginning appropriately enough with (duh!) a tornado, young Joe (played in adulthood by Helen Hunt) is traumatized by the death of her father, who was sucked up in the twister while trying to hold the storm cellar door in place as the tornado comes wailing overhead. This is one of the movie's unexplained events: he is holding the door in place so that his wife and daughter would not be sucked out of the cellar, so when he disappears, why are they still standing there? Also unexplained is the absence of her mother for the rest of the movie: did she die? Was she abducted by aliens? Guess we'll never know.<p>Moving on in years, the present day finds Joe and a crew of storm chasers doing what they love: spotting twisters. It is here that the baggage piles on heavily: her ex-husband, Bill (played by Bill Paxton), wants her to sign divorce papers so he can marry his new girlfriend, who, annoying enough, tags along for most of the movie's ride. Because he wants her to sign the papers, he follows along with her to chase the storms, hoping that the system he devised will be a success. <p>That system is a way of plotting how tornadoes form in hopes that warning time may be increased for areas in harm's way. Of course, these machines must be placed in the storm's path just a few seconds before it reaches that specific spot, making for some incredibly tense situations. And, as if the tornadoes were not a formidable enemy, the movie introduces a rival group of storm chasers with sophisticated equipment and the same system Bill developed. <p>Before I get to the bad parts, I must say that the special effects and action in &quot;Twister&quot; are in all the right places. Director Jan de Bont gets everything right in these areas: our characters find themselves in one tight situation after another. Some are unbelievable, yes (I was a bit unconvinced when the twisters come right up on the hood of the red truck), but in the grand scheme of things, this isn't the kind of movie to take too seriously when it comes to the danger. <p>And the effects will blow you away. This is probably one of the best recreations of inclimate weather ever put forth for the big screen. The twisters themselves are fascinating: for those of us who have always been intrigued by them, this is probably the next best thing to actually seeing one up close (and, I'm sure, a lot safer). Waiting for the first real view of a tornado is one of the best things about this movie, too. <p>But the story is a flop, its only purpose being to supply the motive for the effects and action, while never actually taking on any cling or meaning. Actors Paxton and Hunt, as well as some brilliant supporting actors, are given characters that do little other than put themselves in danger again and again. Basically, the story is there to give the effects a purpose for being the movie, and then it really has nothing else to do and nowhere to go. <p>Overall, it's lacking. This is the kind of movie where the story is overrun by an overabundance of special effects, and while they are terrific, they cannot save the movie completely. I expected more out of the story, and while I was completely enamored with the special effects and technological excellence that was so lovingly extracted for the film, I would've like to have seen better characters for such talented actors.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A GREAT HORROR FILM !"></head><body><p>This is truly one of the best horror films ever made! It's a bloody french kiss to the backwoods genre with an excellent twist to give it some originality. This is a very scary,gory & vicious film,filled with some very High Tension not for weak stomachs & as a huge horror fan i couldn't ask for anything more. Alexandre Aja's "HIGH TENSION" is most certainly distine for horror classic status!</p></body></html>

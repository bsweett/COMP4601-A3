<meta name="summary" content="Intense Psychological Thriller (But You May Not Like it Because of Its Intensity)"></head><body><p>Despite its title that sounds like a B-horror film, "Bug" is not a horror movie and you won't see flesh-eating creatures attacking humans. Instead, in William Friedkin's "Bug," paranoia reigns in a run-down motel room. When Agnes White (Ashley Judd), a lonely and nervous waitress, afraid of her abusive ex-husband, meets a war veteran Peter Evans (Michael Shannon), who believes a curious theory about the "bugs," their relationship triggers something deep inside him, and her - a spiral process in which their loneliness (and delusion) is amplified. You know, this is not a film for everyone.<br /><br />"Bug" intrigued me up to a certain point. In the earlier chapters director William Friedkin suggests Agnes' fears are not totally groundless, using spooky aerial shots or showing Agnes's husband Jerry Goss (Harry Connick Jr.). But about 40 minutes in, the film attempts to shift the audiences' attention from the blurred line between reality and delusion, to the mental conditions of Agnes and Peter, who start acting more and more unusual.<br /><br />Let's face it. Sometimes it is uncomfortable to watch people obsessed with something. This is what happens in "Bug," but there is more to come. What these people would do in this claustrophobic situation is largely predictable once you sense where the story is leading us. Moreover, the process of their growing delusion might be convincing, but it also alienates us from the characters emotionally. Granted, the film is a wild ride, which is amazingly intense with blood and violence, but I am afraid their intensity contains nothing beneath the surface. Or perhaps that is exactly what is intended.<br /><br />Some viewers might be drawn to the intense world Agnes and Peter represent - and two leads are good actors, I admit - but others including me would think the film is rather pretentious, and no matter how they act well, it is obvious they are acting.</p></body></html>

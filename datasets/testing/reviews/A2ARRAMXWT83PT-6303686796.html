<meta name="summary" content="One of DeNiro's best!"></head><body><p>This is the film that made DeNiro and Scorsese famous! It is an interesting and captivating look at a lonely taxi driver, who hates New York, and all of the "scum" that surrounds him. He eventually decends into madness, all the while trying to save a young prostitute from her sleazy pimp boyfriend. Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel also give wonderful performances. Martin Scorsese has a cameo, also. Another thing: the music score by Bernard Herrmann is also a plus. It was the very last score that he ever wrote.<p>See it!</p></body></html>

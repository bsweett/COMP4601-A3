<meta name="summary" content="A true classic"></head><body><p>Where does duty stop and to whom is it due?  These are some of the questions dealt with in this WWII film classic set in a prisoner-of-war camp in Burma.  The matter-of-factness of Alec Guinness is captivating as is William Holden's vacillation between honor and trickery.<p>The prisoners are directed to build a bridge for the Japanese army.  Told that all prisoners will work, Guinness points out the articles in the Geneva Convention that expressly forbid officers from working anything other than administrative chores.  The camp commander refuses to comply and thus begins the battle of wills between them.  The commander has his duty to his superiors, just as Guinness has his duty to the commander, to his country, and to his men.  He does not see the problem of these conflicting duties until it is too late.<p>Holden is an American who is just trying to go home.  After a daring escape, he winds up "volunteering" to return to the POW camp.  Although he just wants to go home, he sense of duty pushes him back.<p>I would recommend seeing this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Death is a diease. If there is a cure, I will find it.""></head><body><p>Three stories. One love. Hugh Jackman as a Spanish conquistador, a modern scientist, and a future astronaut. Rachel Weiz as a queen, a woman dying of cancer. He must rush to save her from cancer as it tears away the fabrics of their relationship and he devolves himself into finding the cure. shows that love can last in every generation.<br /><br />When I walked out of the movie, I had feelings of weirdness simmering all over my body after I watched a remarkable film. The film was simple yet made complex with the imagery and the hidden meanings. The meanings don't damper the film, it makes the film all that better, it makes the audience think, about what they just saw. Movies these days don't make you think. They apply the same motions to you and they expect you to clap and cheer for that movie, but no, this movie in itself is not like that. It leaves the audience, with a sense of confusion when they leave because the film bombards you with breathtaking things and multiple meaning imagery. The director wants you to figure out what was going on, and how you would interpret it because this film doesn't have just one meaning applied to the same situation over and over again. It has multiple meanings that are constantly changed based on your viewing experience. The meanings vary from person to person.<br /><br />The acting in the film was not all the best. Hugh Jackman delivers the most avant garde performance of the film, going all out and showing more range than he has as Wolverine or any other film roles. He takes his role seriously and he earns my respect as a dramatic actor because he certianly has proved that he can be a damn good one. Ellen Burystn, of Requiem For A Dream fame, is really underused in the picture. She really doesn't provide anything new to the movie and didn't really spark my interest in the performance. Rachel Weiez, the wife of Aronofsky, was good for what her role provided her. She took the role and tried to make it her own, and she looked beautiful in the process.<br /><br />The directing aspect of the film was top notch. Using the bacteria patterns for the 2026 scenes or whatever future year was perfect and spell binding to me. Also, I noticed that he used natural light opposed to artifical, I liked it, it gave the movie a more gritter feel to me in the past and future sequences. Also, There were some excellent shots, for example, Hugh Jackman walking towards The Tree of Life, and the whole futuristic sequences were outstanding. Although Aronofsky has been known for making really long films, the films length, over a hour and 30 minutes, was perfect for it as the imagery didn't get tiring and stale. He hit you with enough of it to stick in your head.<br /><br />When you make a film that can possibly have a audience love or hate it, and it sticks in your head and you discuss it and have conversations about the hidden meanings in the film, then it is a fine film for what goes through your thought process and the film maker's job is done when it leaves you with that feeling. I have a weird feeling that I am going to thinking about this movie for days to come.</p></body></html>

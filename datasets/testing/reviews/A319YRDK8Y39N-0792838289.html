So much that Kennedy's assassination kept this movie from distribution for a number of years. Though the thought of brainwashing a trained soldier to turn on his own country, especially in the manner portrayed in the film, may be a little far-fetched, similar scenarios really aren't out of the realm of possibilities, as the world we live in keeps proving.<p>This early film of director John Frankenheimer (Ronan) is simply very enjoyable. It holds action, drama, and personal conflict all with a satirical edge. The cast, including Frank Sinatra, is good, but Angela Lansbury is particularly impressive as the sergeant's power-hunger mother. More then anything, though, it stands the test of time. The message it gives, that the government needs to be ready for anything all the time, still needs to be heard, learned, and understood today.<p>Even for those that don't like black and white films might take exception to this movie. The story is so modern, it's easy to forget it was made forty years ago. Check this one out!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="del Toro's creativity and detemination...with unexpected levels of violence"></head><body><p>Writer/Director Guillermo del Toro is simply off-the-charts here in terms of creativity, imagination and having the dogged determination to get all this shaped into a project and then to film.  And Sergi L&oacute;pez is a personal favorite, equally adept at playing bad (and, wow, is he ever bad here) and good.  And Maribel Verd&uacute;?  Well, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL57">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>...enough said.<br /><br />That said, I believe Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBGC">The Lives of Others</a> is the better film (the best film in at least five years, in my opinion), and deserving of its Oscar this year.  I'll also note that I was more than a little jarred by how unrelentingly violent "Pan's" was.  Sure, it depicts guerrilla warfare and it's hard to dress that up as happy chat, but - wow - when Sergi L&oacute;pez takes a broken bottle to the that guy's face, it literally left me shaken for the next ten minutes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sex, sadism and some historic data"></head><body><p>Eventually, this next Holocaust-related vaudeville is the latest attempt to professionally contribute a tragic topic visualisation by an "eatable" way attracting contemporary viewers with murdering, gore, blood mixed with sex, sadism and some historic data.<br /><br />Performing is starling, characters are clever, educated, and professional and worth each other enemies, Brad Pitt is sexy even in moms and baggy camouflage, Hitler looks the most realistic than in any other movie a reviewer had seen, a clone from "Adolf & Eva" surely  - and something anyway in the air not allowing to top-mark this work. Probably, it is an unnecessary exaggeration of producer's own delusions of both history recorded and glorifying the unspeakable to an extent of heroic.</p></body></html>

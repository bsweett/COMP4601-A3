The cast is perfect, writing and plot development is excellent and the laughs don't stop coming. It's difficult to wrap up this film in a review, but if you're familiar with the unconventional humor of Will Ferrell, you won't want to miss this one. One of his best. Watch with friends.</p></body></html>

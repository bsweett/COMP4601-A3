<meta name="summary" content="A very strange little film"></head><body><p>I haven't read the book but Next is a strange film. Nicholas Cage acts well and when the film starts, it tends to draw your interest. If you're travelling on an airplane and switching between what to watch, Next is the movie you should stop at. Being 90 minutes, it doesn't hurt your clock. The best thing about the film is Nicholas Cage and the scenes involving him trying to make up his mind. The movie has no more than one central character. Sounds like a very difficult film to make, they've done an ok job. Don't hate your life when you watch the end though. Story? A man can see his own life two minutes into the future, there is no details as to how or why or his past (thankyou) and it NEXT just goes about it's business quite unselfconsciously.</p></body></html>

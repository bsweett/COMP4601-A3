<meta name="summary" content="Forrest Gump (1994)"></head><body><p>Forrest Gump...what is there to say? Excellent movie. It's seeing history and telling it from a point of view. Many people, who were not in the era, do not realize how everything was, until they see this movie. With history is the whole 'true love' plot, which goes well for the movie. This movie is definitely one of my favorites, my friends and I can remember it word for word and we use many quotes till this day. I highly recommend this movie because of all the great actors, the plot, etc. I look at it as a drama and to me, drama has a little bit of everything in it.</p></body></html>

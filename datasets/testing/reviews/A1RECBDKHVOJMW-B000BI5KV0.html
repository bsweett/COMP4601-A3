<meta name="summary" content=""A heartwarming film from the coldest place on Earth.""></head><body><p>This dramatic, passionate, often humorous, sometimes tragic adventure film which portrays birth, death, survival against all odds, and if you'll forgive a bit of anthropomorphizing, love and fidelity, is at once uplifting and heartbreaking...and it's a documentary (!!), probably more compelling than most (fiction) movies I have seen in the last few years!<br /><br />The Emperor Penguins star here. They are magnificent birds which do not fly, but are outstanding swimmers. The largest and heaviest of the 17 species of penguins, their fashionable dress is classic - black head and wings, white abdomen, bluish gray, almost iridescent back, purplish pink bill. On the sides of the neck, there are two golden circular stripes. I actually think fashionistas consulted them before designing the tuxedo! Can you just see them walking down the "Red Carpet" to receive their Oscars?<br /><br />The plot sounds fairly simple - a year in the life of an Emperor Penguin colony - a full life cycle. Yet theirs is neither a simple nor easy story to live or to film.<br /><br />Their home is at the bottom of the world, the desert continent of Antarctica, (the world's largest desert), and the coldest place on Earth. Ninety-eight percent of the continent is covered by ice - a place well known for its ferocious winds and blinding storms. It is the windiest and least hospitable continent on our planet. Localized blizzards and life-threatening wind-chill temperatures are an ever-present danger.  Temperatures reach a minimum of between minus 85 and minus 90 degrees Celsius, (-121 and -130 degrees Fahrenheit), in the winter and about 30 degrees higher in the summer months. Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. I think it is important to describe the penguins' habitat, which is the film's setting and a major villain, (more anthropomorphizing), to give potential viewers a clear picture of the environment in which these birds live and thrive. The environment also makes for some breathtaking and chilling viewing.<br /><br />With great detail, the entire breeding cycle is shown, beginning with the long springtime march of the penguins from the sea to their inland breeding grounds - about 90 km. Courtship rites, the laying of the egg and the very careful transfer and protection of that 1 pound egg from female to male is just the start of this annual true life adventure. I won't write anything to spoil the rest of this almost unbelievable tale. I won't even go into how utterly adorable the baby penguins are and the lengths their parents will go to in order to protect them. Nature, and the truth, are more amazing then fiction.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's narration is splendid.<br /><br />"March of the Penguins" is quite simply, glorious. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A suggestion, Part 2, which has yet to be made, should be about the courageous French director, Luc Jacquet, a trained biologist, cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison, and their crew who traveled to the Antarctica, overcoming hardships similar to those of their subjects, to make this astounding motion picture.<br /><br />JANA</p></body></html>

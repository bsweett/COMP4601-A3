<meta name="summary" content="One of, if not, the best thriller to date"></head><body><p>And I say the best because this movie is so much more than just your typical horror film.  This film has a bite that most don't, it has a sense of reality, a gritty sense of human emotion that gets left out of most horror films.  This movie takes the time to explain it's charactors, everyone from Somerset (Freeman) to Mills (Brad Pitt in his BEST role ever) and even your killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey, Brilliant as he always is).  I thought that was the best part of this movie, that it took the time to explain your killer, took the time to get you inside his head and see why he was the way that he was and to see the reactions that he had to others and the reactions that they had to him (especially Pitt...the scene of dialog alone between Pitt and Spacey in the police car towards the end is the best scene in the film)...So our story revolves around a group of murders in NYC all based on various 'deadly-sins'...opening scene is an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst.  So you see that our killer forces his victims to kill themselves via their sin.  (The most disturbing is lust, believe me!)  So even though the film never shows a murder take place you see the aftermath of each and each one in particular is disturbing in itself.  The while air to this film is creepy, eeire and puts you in a mood before the suspence starts.  You must know that this is not the 'jump out of your seat and pee your pants' type of film, its more like the type you think about later with the lights on and your covers pulled up to your head.  It's a pschological thriller that messes with your head, makes you think about why this man did what he did and may even make you wonder if he had a point.  There is a strong moral backdrop to this movie, which is also something that is lacking in almost every other horror film.  The killer had a reason, maybe not an excuse buthe had a reason that he was able to justify in his mind for doing what he did...a reason that he calculated out, that he meditated on and most importantly, it was a reason he BELIEVED in...it was a code that he lived by and he was convinced was right even though he knew it was wrong.  Kevin Spacey is so convincing in his portrayal of a disturbed man, a man plauged by a hightened sense of morality that forced him to be morally coruptable.  This is a movie I think everyone should see, if not for sheer entertainment, see it for the message it conveys, a message that can be contorted and twisted to fit anyones interpretation, I guess the only way to really appreciate this film is to watch it and interprete it for yourself.</p></body></html>

This 2005 film is an adaptation of the 1964 book of the same name, which was written by Roald Dahl.<br /><br />The first message is that of loyalty and the price that comes with betrayal. Because of this, one of Charlie's grandfathers lost his job, along with all the other human employees.<br /><br />The second lesson is that of hope and destiny. Charlie, and his parents and all four grandparents live in a run down hut. His hope is to get a golden ticket that would allow him to tour the Chocolate Factory and get the opportunity to get a 'grand prize'.<br /><br />The sets and the music in the movie are really catchy, the Oompa-Loompas (all played by Deep Roy) are really cool... It is amazing how they had him do all of those roles, especially when synchronized.<br /><br />The most important lesson that I feel that this movies teaches is that children ought to obey and respect their elders. Otherwise there can be dire consequences, which are as so graphically portrayed in this film. It is a very enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="shouldve skipped this one."></head><body><p>well,in this movie the eversexy elektra ............yes,the same eversexy sl&t from daredevil,gets her own story told.and wouldnt you know it?they threw the comic book version right out the window and just did things thier way.the only thing the same between the movie and the comic is that there is a sexy chick who can do martial arts.no different sinsai every year since she was 5,no love relationship with daredevil and a bunch of other stuff.then theres the bad guys.theres a lot but they all get wasted too fast.one guy can absorb just about any shot[like a point blank shotgun blast].theres tattoo.this guy makes his tats come alive and keep tabs on elektra.ooooohhh!!!!!!thats exiting.if i had that power,id draw a sexy chick who was my sex slave.......................anyhow,he could have easily just tatted on a giant or a dragon,but chose crows and wolves.hes a old spider man villian i think anyhow.than theres typhoid mary who can kiss someone and kill them.while its vaguely lesbian oriented when she does it,elektra rots and dies.so much for my semi.THAT WAS NOT A SPOILER.elektras fine.and whats with the blind martial arts instructer?can we say daredevil,kung fu,kill bill and many many more?its about as good as the next film out there.i only watched it to see every marvel movie.is it just me or are these getting worse and worse.this one takes the entire marvel average down to an c.watch it,rent it but unless youre in love with [whats her name?]IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT HER NAME IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,then dont buy it.</p></body></html>

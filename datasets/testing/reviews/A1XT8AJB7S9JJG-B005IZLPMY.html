I say B"></head><body><p>"Our goal is to create the greatest army in history. But every army begins with one man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldier." After tiny Steve Rogers is once again denied entrance to the US Army he is followed by Dr. Abraham Erskine. When told about an option to join he jumps on it. After a series of tests he is given an experimental procedure to make him s "super-soldier". He comes out bigger, stronger and faster. He becomes Captain America. This movie is another victim of hype. This is a very good movie, but it's not the "best superhero" movie ever. I do think that the releasing has a lot to do with that. In my opinion the best superhero movie of the year was "X-Men : First Class", and if this came out first I may have liked this more. The one thing I really liked about this movie is that it was more like "X-Men" then "Green Lantern" in the fact that it was more about the story then effects. That did help the movie, as well as the casting. Overall, this is a good movie but with the hype, as well as the other comic book movies released lately, I was expecting more. I give it a B.<br /><br />*Also try - Iron Man & X-Men : First Class</p></body></html>

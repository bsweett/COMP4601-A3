<meta name="summary" content="Saw the Movie was not impressed.not too funny sadly."></head><body><p>This movie is not as funny as the first sadly, where the first meet the parents movie was hilarious this one lacks it, it's not that this movie is not Funny. it is. but not as much as the 1st one. Then you add in the new cast of characters it just didn't do it for me sadly. It could have been better, there is a 3rd installment rumored to come as of this writing which will be about the kids, let's hope it's better and funnier. Pass this one, go for the 1st. I rented it and was disappointed.</p></body></html>

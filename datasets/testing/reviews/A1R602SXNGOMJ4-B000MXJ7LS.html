I can say that have kleenex handy because you'll need it.  Never in my entire life have I cried for so long and so hard during a movie.  No movie has ever affected me this way.<br /><br />Many of us remember that morning so vividly. September 11th, 2001.  I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see the film.  I remember watching the TV, glued to it, for answers to the questions that I never will have answered as to how something so horrible could happen. This film doesn't attempt to try to answer that question, instead it looks at the spirit of people and how we can come together to help others.<br /><br />I am so glad I decided to see this! It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. It's a film of last words and feelings we tend to develop after years in a relationship. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this film with strong acting from a huge cast.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film although it may certainly be tough for those who lost loved ones in the buildings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FIGHT CLUB MEETS TEXAS CHAINSAW!"></head><body><p>Well it has become more and more harder to find<br />HORROR films I don't own.Friends from Amazon<br />have been VERY helpful(thanks M.MORIARITY,BIZZ<br />of course HORRORMAN Mikeliddell JENNY,STEVE and<br />can't forget BLACKSHERE or R.A. and Amy)so I<br />cruised my fav.local DVD store and came upon<br />this.It was $10.00 and I thought hmmmm put<br />ten dollars in a slot machine or try some<br />HORROR you have never seen.I opted for the latter<br />and am happy for the middle scene in this was worth<br />the price alone,very graphic and scary at the same<br />time.Recommend to those who don't mind decapatation's<br />and Tom Savini type effects. The reason for 3 stars<br />instead of 5 is for the WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST<br />WATCH ENDING! If you like Fight Club and HORROR<br />this is your cup of Brandy. For me I prefer a<br />straight story and none of this I'M HERE BUT I'M NOT!<br />I WAS THERE BUT I FORGOT!<br />anyway my AMAZONE HORROR FRIENDS(you know who you are)<br />give this a try,I thought the middle scene was worthy<br />to ARGENTO and the movie BLACK CHRISTMAS(1974)<br />take it easy and watch with the LIGHTS ON!</p></body></html>

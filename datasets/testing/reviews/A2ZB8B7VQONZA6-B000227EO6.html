<meta name="summary" content="THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME-QUINTIN TARANTINO"></head><body><p>I'am so glad I could go see KILL BILL VOL.2 in theaters on the opening weekend. QUINTIN TARANTINO is my all time favorite filmmaker, he is the greatest of all time. This film took almost an entirly diffrent turn from the first installment. Where the first one was almost all violence [which was great]this one was more about a focus on characters. Don't get me wrong there was still enough of that in here. <p>This one starts out with the wedding massacre and draws it's tone off of that. It's more about the characters and their lives, and their history. We start off with Bill coming to wish our hero good luck with her new life and you know what happens from there. In fact we see BILL through out the entire film, and that was a wise choice because he is a great character.<p>I find it really funny that MICHAEL MADSION's character did what a bunch of ninja's couldn't do, defeat her. All he did was sit in his chair, wait for her to open the door, and blasted her. Then came the really messed up part when he buried her alive, man that was great.<p>Next up was the history of how she was trained to have all that skill, and that guy was great. He made me laugh the whole time, that guy was great. That actually might be my favorite parts of the movie.<p>Through out the film we get a little look at the history between BILL and "THE BRIDE" [you'll find out her name]. Those scenes have alot of impact on the final sequence of the film. If you don't pay attention the end might not make sense to you.<p>And like I said there is a nice amount of violence in this one, like when the beatifull Uma Thurman battles that one eyed chick. Wait till you see what happens.<p>The cinematography for this film was amazing, the shots threw out this film were just so good. And of course the writing for it was outstanding.<p>I don't really want to give up to much and ruin it for you, I highly recommend you all go out and see this movie ASAP.</p></body></html>

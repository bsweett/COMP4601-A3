What a visual conception!  Goobers coming up from the floor, the unforgettable scene of spinal cord meeting the goopy brain, the gelid, slippery goo, the half-formed rib cage - hello vicar!<br /><br />Larry and Julia Cotton are moving into the house left to Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his wayward brother Frank (Sean Chapman).  The house is a mess, with maggots in the kitchen and a makeshift bed and evil shrine in one of the upstairs rooms.  The shrine shows evidence that Frank has been and gone from the house.<br /><br />After cleanup, while moving, Larry cuts his hand on a nail and bleeds heavily onto the bare floorboards of the room which formerly held the shrine.  Julia (played by Clare Higgins - her businesslike sexiness was a real turn-on) has been reminiscing in the room over her former affair with Frank.<br /><br />It turns out Frank had been playing with a very dangerous toy in his room, Lemarchard's Box, which opens the gates to a hellish realm ruled by Cenobites from the Order Of The Gash.  Indeed, Frank unlocked the gates to hell itself.  Larry's blood on the floor sparks Frank's return from hell, growing his flesh back from goo.<br /><br />Enter the Cenobites, "Angels to some, Nightmares to others", starring Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley).  The cenobites rule the worlds of pain and pleasure (we have such sights to show you).  Frank wants to come back from hell, and convinces Julia to bring him more blood in order to fill out his fleshless body.<br /><br />But she's observed by Kirsty, Larry's daughter, and when Kirsty discovers that Frank is alive in the house, she manages to get the box away from him and inadvertently summons the Cenobites again.  Can Kirsty make a bargain with Hell, for Pinhead to accept Frank's return instead of taking her?<br /><br />This is one of the best horror flicks ever made.  Pinhead rocks!  He's evil and nasty looking, as are his followers.  There's a lot of gore and gross, gooey things in the film, more than enough to satisfy that unnatural taste you have for bleeding flesh.  Julia's coldness always drew me to her.  I loved it, her elegant, icy demeanor.  I also love Kirsty's happy drunk.  It reminded me of me.  The upside-down Hell-Monster was cheesy-cool, unique and frightening.<br /><br />If you are a horror aficionado and don't own this movie, then buy it ... it won't disappoint.  A 10-Star horror flick.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

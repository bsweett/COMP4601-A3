<meta name="summary" content="In a word...........muddled"></head><body><p>This is a review of the movie seen at the theater, NOT the BD release planned for the future.<br /><br />Chances are if you're reading this you're a fan of the Pirates franchise, and/or Depp and company so are willing to overlook the fact that this is a money spinning exercise set squarely in the "popcorn flick" genre of summer blockbusters.<br />Much has been made of the absence of Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, in so far as they thought it enough of a ridiculous and unnecessary 4th outing as to not be involved, but the inclusion of Penelope Cruz, and Ian McShane more than make up for that anyway (in my opinion).<br /><br />This latest, somewhat shorter installment treads much of the same ground as the previous 3 to no surprise, and like them or hate them, you have to agree in part to continuing a winning formula. A critics dream this is not, but of course it will still wow plenty of summer audiences, and no doubt be a financial success.<br /><br />So to my "muddled" comment. Well the story (which was probably conceived as a good idea somewhere) revolves around Jack Sparrow searching for the fountain of youth.<br />Tagging along are the ever pleasing Jeffrey Rush as Barbossa chewing scenery as he goes, and arch nemesis Ian McShane as Blackbeard, complete with beautiful daughter Cruz.<br />Secret silver chalices, CGI mermaids that change from beauty to beast while attacking, and an ever present need for the cast to explain what is going on, just makes the whole thing look muddled.<br /><br />Depp's antics stretch credulity even more than usual, as does most of the story, from an initial escape (again) to the plot twisting quest. Another criticism for me would be that Cruz and Depp do not have the spark or chemistry they should, probably safer to say that Depp and Rush have more.<br /><br />Of course it's a PG-13 so the action and eye candy abound. That's probably what saves the movie somewhat, it's less plodding than the previous movies, and as long as you can suspend disbelief enough, you'll enjoy the action sequences that seem to bombard most of the film.<br /><br />No spoilers here, just accept it for what it is. 3 Stars</p></body></html>

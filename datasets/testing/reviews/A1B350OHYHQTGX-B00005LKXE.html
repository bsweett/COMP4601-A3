<meta name="summary" content="Ridley Scott you did it again!"></head><body><p>It is truly an amazing film. Forget the sequal... to me this one is much better than the first! This movie drives you through a master piece of suspense and thriller.<p>The make up was brillaint and thrilling for the &quot;deformed man&quot;! Anthony Hopkins played his role well but the big credit I give to Ridley Scott!<p>The two things that got me not to rate it 5 stars was:<p>1. The story did not cover how did Dr. Lecter manage to do everything (job, escape, travel ..etc.) without any assistance!<p>2. The scene at the dining table at the end of the film was a bit over exaggerated!<p>Other than that, it was a movie not to be missed!</p></body></html>

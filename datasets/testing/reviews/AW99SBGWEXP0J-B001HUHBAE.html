<meta name="summary" content="Zodiac"></head><body><p>In the late 1960's, the Zodiac killer terrorized Northern California.  Investigating the murders were detectives Dave Roschi (Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Edwards).  Reporting on the murders in the press were Paul Avery (Downey) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal).  In fact, the movie is based on Graysmith's book and the obsession he developd in trying to find the Zodiac's identity.  As such, the "solution" provided has not been proven, but is the belief of Graysmith.<br /><br />"Zodiac" is an interesting and well made movie.  Fincher's direction is not a showy as his previous efforts, but keeps the tension high when necessary and interjects small moments of humor to lighten the mood when necessary.  Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Downey, and Edwards are all very good in their roles, and Lynch is suitably creepy for most of his screen time.  "Zodiac" may move too slowly for some in its last half, but those that want a peek into the hunt for a serial killer will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend "Zodiac".</p></body></html>

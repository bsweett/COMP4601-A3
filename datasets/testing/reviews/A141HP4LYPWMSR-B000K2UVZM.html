There's simply nothing entertaining or engaging about this movie. It's admittedly stylish, but so slow. Making matters worse, there's no sympathetic figure to care about.<br /><br />Ranging from the amoral police practices of officers Bleichert and Blanchard to the rich, perverse and disgusting Linscott family, the storyline drifts through the seedier bars and nightspots of Los Angeles circa late `40's. The only one to muster a spark of interest is Mia Kirshner in the ill-fated role of Elizabeth Short (Black Dahlia) but her part is so short and interspersed so infrequently through the film it's virtually impossible to maintain your connection with the character. I recommend you pass on this one.</p></body></html>

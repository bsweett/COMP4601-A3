This is a pretty straight forward tale of 2 port authority police officers on the day of 9/11.  They find themselves trapped under the rubble of one of the towers.  It also flashes often to their families and the effects it has one them.  This is a well made film, and it jumped right to the attacks within the first 15 minutes.  There is not much in the way of action, as the 2 main characters are pinned down and do not move the last hour and half of the picture.  It is haunting watching the images of the rubble and the shock on the people.  Decent acting all the way around, though the New York accents were exagerrated a bit.  Stone chose to focus on 2 people out of 20 that were pulled from the rubble.  Part of me would have liked to see the stories of some of the others.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bad Moon Rising"></head><body><p>I'd read that the impetus for AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON started in the former Yugoslovia in 1969.  A young John Landis was working on KELLEY'S HEROES and saw a burial at the fork in a road straight out of an old Transylvania movie.<br />He wrote his werewolf movie, but it went nowhere until Landis hit it big with ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS.  He then took out his werewolf script called (as the story goes) AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS, a take off on the Gene Kelly musical, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS.  When the French didn't cooperate with locations, the setting was changed to London.<br />That's what I'd read.<p>One of the things that makes this film so special--other than the lean writing and the (at that time) eye-popping special effects--is how it manages to be both funny and scary.<br />How often do you find that?<br />I met John Landis at a film festival recently and he's very modest about his films.  He shrugs off ANIMAL HOUSE and WEREWOLF, sometimes referring to them as "my dumb little movies."  I'm just Joe Schmo Fan but I hope he someday realizes how great those films are.  Hollywood is STILL trying to make lightning strike again like it did with ANIMAL HOUSE and how many horror movies can you count that strike such the exquisite balance of AMERICAN WEREWOLF?  (If you bring up the RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD movies, then you've already lost the argument).<p>As far as the extras on the DVD, I was disappointed by the actors' commentary.  Too many dead spaces.  As much as Landis loves to talk about movies, I'm still wondering why he doesn't do commentaries for ANIMAL HOUSE and AMERICAN WEREWOLF.<br />He did an excellent commentary for KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE with Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers. <p>What young American boy, especially the space cadet nerd, didn't have a crush on Jenny Agutter after LOGAN'S RUN and AMERICAN WEREWOLF? <p>(One last little note: the film also makes great use of London locales.  Picadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, the London Underground, etc.).</p></body></html>

Sadly it loses it's impact with repeated viewing. Following an assassin who attempts to kill the emperor this film has plenty of plot twists and intrigue. Coupled with the vivid colours, incredible locations and set design and flawless fight choreography this makes for one visual feast. I've come to realise that however amazing the fight scenes are, they are less impressive second time round and they actually drag by the end of the film. Scene after scene of flowing combat, however graceful, become tiresome after a while. Luckily this film has a strong enough plotline to sustain it. Jet Li is great in the main role and all the supporting actors are highly admirable as well. This film is very much in the vein of others produced around this time ('Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon`, `House of Flying Daggers' and `Curse of the Golden Flower') I.e. it has lush, rich colours, awe inspiring costume design and the cinematography/direction is highly polished. This makes for a short, but captivating film and although it may lose it's charm after the first time you watch it, that first time is so breath taking it more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

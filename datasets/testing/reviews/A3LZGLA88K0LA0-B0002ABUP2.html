DAWN OF THE DEAD is a cataclysmic, desperate film that spares no punches in delineating the hopelessness of such a widespread and untraceable epidemic.  This remake far surpasses the original in its intensity and of course it's a much better made movie.  While George Romero's original is definitely a cult classic, it remains a low budget film that never felt real.  In Zack Snyder's version, the situation seems real and the characters' fate can only be surmised as doomed.<br /><br />An intelligent script and cast help elevate this zombie flick.  Jake Weber as Michael, the nice guy next door type adds a brooding sensualism to his role; Sarah Polley has a tough endurance that makes her very likeable; Michael Kelly as the macho CJ is effective as he starts out as a smartass and ends up heroic; Mekhi Phifer is good in the role of the expectant father who must face a horrible truth; Jayne Eastwood as Norma is reminiscent of every truck stop hostess out there; Ving Rhames is solid in his cop role; and the rest of the supporting cast including Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth, do well.  The extras are okay, but they don't add much at all to the movie.<br /><br />All in all, for zombie flicks, this one is up there on top.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Simple But Entertaining Action Movie"></head><body><p>This is a lively action movie designed mainly to entertain, not enlighten.  As such, the plot does stretch credulity at many points, but you won't really notice if you avoid critical thinking and just go with the flow.  There's plenty of violence, though it's not over the top.  Most importantly, an action movie should succesfully create and maintain suspense and tension, and this one does that.<br /><br />Liam Neeson does an excellent job playing the lead good guy, and his performance is perhaps the greatest strength of the movie.  Sterotypically, the bad guys are almost exclusively foreigners.  And the portrayal of the main daughter character is also weakened by stereotyping.<br /><br />Overall, I can recommend this movie if you're looking for some decent action-oriented entertainment, and not expecting anything that will expand your horizons.</p></body></html>

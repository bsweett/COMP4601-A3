<meta name="summary" content="Excellent sequel bigger but of the same quality as the first film."></head><body><p>Sequels are tough to do because you know what to expect so filmmaker's often have to give you that plus something unexpected. Bigger and better may not always translate to better but it often translates to a sequel that is the equal of the film that spawned it. I'm going to assume that you've seen it (if not there's a critical bit at the end of this along with a plot synposis that is as sketchy as possible so as not to spoil the experience of the film) and focus on why you should buy the upgraded Blu-ray. As good as "The Mummy Returns" looks on DVD, the Blu-ray is even better looking. Colors are bolder and there's signficantly more detail but, more important, the dark scenes look much better here. The lossless audio sounds terrific as well and will put you right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />You should be aware however that Edge Enhancement is more noticeable in the BR than it was in the HD-DVD disc or the DVD and there is a fair amount of digital noise reduction applied to reduce grain in certain scenes. What does that mean? It means that we do lose some detail.<br /><br />Be aware, however, that the extras are in 480p and NOT in HD. Universal does port over U-Control (which was developed for HD-DVD) where you can customize special features on the BD disc. We get all the extras from the original single disc set plus the new extras from the 2 disc DVD ported over to the BD. "The Mummy Returns" is nicely packaged in a colorful slipcase (although I think they could have done without this). At Best Buy and Circuit City (as well as select other retailers there is also movie cash included. You have to go online and register so you can print out your movie ticket (which is good only through 8/24/08 and the site which was up earlier for access to print your ticket now requires you to wait until 8/1/08. I guess some people used their tickets early for other movies or Universal is doing this as a precautionary move).<br /><br />"The Mummy Returns" is less of a scary horror flick than its predecessor and even more like a "Raiders" type of flick. A perfect popcorn movie, Stephen Sommers takes the same ingredients (evil mummy resurrected, adventurers seeking artifacts and fortunes, supernatural powers)and creates a film that is every bit as fun as the first film was. Like "Aliens" relationship with "Alien", "The Mummy Returns" focuses on taking characters we knew from the first film and putting them in a slightly different context this time around.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS:<br /><br />Rick (Brendan Fraiser)and Evie (Rachel Weisz)now have a 9 year old son Alex(Freddie Boath)and are still digging in dusty old tombs in Egypt. The year of the Scorpion has arrived which means that if Baltus (Alun Armstrong) and the reincarnation of Im-Ho-Tep's (Arnold Vosloo)love Meela-Nais (Patricia Velasquez returning from the first film in a much larger role) can raise Im-Ho-Tep he can take on the Scorpion King (The Rock) Im-Ho-Tep can use the armies of the underworld to rule the world. Alex is taken prisoner and Rick, Evie and Jonathan (John Hannah)Evie's brother must travel to Egypt to help Ardeth Bey (Oded Fehr)stop the creature, get their son and save the world.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant Sci-Fi Classic Now In Blu-Ray To Mostly Positive Effect!"></head><body><p>Although rarely if ever mentioned whenever sci-fi classics are discussed, "Planet of the Apes" deserves a place on the same pedestal as Classic Trek, Forbidden Planet and even Kubrick's 2001 as an original and very thought-provoking story that also serves as a great social satire for the times i.e. U.S. in the late 60s.  This blu-ray version certainly does not let the great content down as the picture quality although not perfect still looks very good in 1080p despite the fact that there are a few poorly preserved frames here and there throughout the film.  The sound quality though in DTS HD MA 5.1 surround is very good albeit the mostly front heavy nature of the original source means we don't get to fully appreciate this audio option.  The special features are good but not great but overall this is the best version of this great film that is currently out there.<br /><br />Being a big fan of Rod Serling and his Twilight Zone series I could see the Serling influence in the screenplay which he co-wrote; certainly the surprise ending is truly Twilight Zonish in nature not to mention the satirical references to prevailing social issues of the time which is another Zone trademark.  This is a great film but the many follow-up sequels are not and they fall far short of the brilliance that this the original film achieves.<br /><br />No sci-fi film buff should be without this film in their video library and this blu-ray release is currently the best version of the film that is out there.  Get this but ignore the sequels.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

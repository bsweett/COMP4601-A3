Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and Gary Cole also do good work. However, I do have one issue with this film: why is there a scene of the kid hugging his dad? personally, i think that's disgusting. View the film for Mr. Williams' performance. R(More nudity of the female would have been nice, though). Rated R.</p></body></html>

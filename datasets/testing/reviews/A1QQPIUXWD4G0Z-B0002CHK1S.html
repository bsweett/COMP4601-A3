<meta name="summary" content="One of John Carpenter's Best Films"></head><body><p>The 1982 remake of the 1951 film 'The Thing from Another World' directed by John Carpenter with great effects by Rob Bottin makes this film a keeper. Although the story is nothing new and pretty much the same as the original, the film carries punch with good acting and special effects.<br /><br />  The story is essentially the same as the original. A military expedition is sent to investigate the crash site of a mysterious alien craft in the Arctic. An alien body is found frozen and taken back to the camp. As the alien body thaws, things start going horribly wrong. Kurt Russel is the main character who has to confront the full horror of the mysterious alien.<br /><br />  What makes this film worthwhile is the suspense of not knowing how or when the alien creature will strike next.  Also worthwhile are the great special effects which, of course, couldn't have been possible in 1951.  Both elements bring to life one of the more decent plots to come out of the 1950s Sunday matinee pulp horror/sci-fi films such as 'The Blob' and other 'B' movies. The cinematography is good and the acting decent. A film worth watching more than once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excitement and Explosions Make Die Hard a Sure Fire Hit"></head><body><p>John McTiernan's star has been fading lately, but it shone like a supernova with 1988's Die Hard, a taut and exciting action thriller that made Bruce Willis an international star and began a trend of explosion-laden action thrillers that followed its basic formula -- sometimes successfully, but more often not.<p>The story takes a basic Western-movie plotline (lone hero faces off against a band of menacing black hats) and pulls it forward into the late 20th Century.  N.Y. Detective John McClane (Willis) arrives in L.A. for a Christmas vacation with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and their children.  At a Christmas office party in the still unfinished Nakatomi building (where Holly has an executive office), a band of what seems to be a group of well-financed terrorists takes most of the partygoers hostage.  It is up to McClane, who luckily is in a rest room as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his thugs crash the party, to foil the villains and rescue the hostages.<p>McTiernan, working from a screenplay by Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza, blends in various types of styles into Die Hard.  With the relationship between McClane and L.A. police Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald Veljohnson) he inserted the "buddy picture."  With the police angle, he uses the "cops and robbers" theme.  The screenplay and movie also highlight wit and droll humor -- especially on Gruber's part. As the prime mover of the action, it's Gruber who's the protagonist, with Willis as the heroic antagonist.<p>The 5-Star Collection DVD is one of 20th Century Fox's best releases to date. The widescreen format and sound are great, the new interactive menus are eyepopping, and the extra features on both discs are excellent.  Although perhaps a bit more expensive than either the VHS or original DVD release, the new Collector's Editions of the Die Hard films are worth every penny.</p></body></html>

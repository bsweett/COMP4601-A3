<meta name="summary" content="A Suprisingly Different and Good Sequel. 84 out of 100."></head><body><p>When I popped Underworld Evolution in the DVD player I expected it to be the same as the first, only chopped into pieces and reassembled. I was wrong.<br /><br />Underworld Evolution is its own film. Yes, it still had Lycans and Vampires, but it has so much more. Firstly, the scene is not urban. Most of the movie is set in a wintry hinterland, which was fine by me. I loved the new setting. It made the sequel feel the same, but refreshingly different.<br /><br />There were also new monsters and bad guys. The winged vampire was one of the best cinema bad monsters to date. Awesome job! I would love to see a third movie with more creative monster madness.<br /><br />Lastly, the story holds its own and doesn't resemble the first. This is good.<br /><br />Overall, Underworld Evolution is a great addition to the Underworld family. I highly recommend the film. I do have a couple nit-picky items I would like to mention. First, Lycans don't really play much of a prominent role in this film except for Michael Corvin. It is much more of a vampire flick with some Lycan scenes thrown in to hold continuity from the first Underworld.<br /><br />Secondly, Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin in underused in the movie. Near the end, before his return, I almost forgot about him. While he was on screen quite a bit, there wasn't much about him that really mattered. I thought his character would play a prominent role in the sequel, but he was more of a minor player. His "hybrid" was of little importance. Kate Beckinsale's transformation was much more interesting and captivating.<br /><br />Lastly, the scene with Kate and Scott where Kate broke down in tears was a bit over dramatic and not really believable. This isn't a rip on Kate's acting - she did a wonderful job - but more a commentary on how little chemistry was developed between Michael Corvin and Selene in the sequel. I didn't buy there love affair, if you will.<br /><br />Great flick! See it! Buy it! Overall I enjoyed it slightly more than the first.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 84<br /><br />44 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Immersion.

Years?<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br /><br />6 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

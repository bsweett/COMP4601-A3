Brad Pitt plays the brash young detective that has come to replace him.  In their week together, they work on finding a serial killer whose victims are all tortured (gruesomely) and killed to illustrate the "seven deadly sins."<br /><br />  Freeman is wonderful, as always, playing a character similiar to his "Red" in The Shawshank Redemption:  soft-spoken, patient, and wise.  Pitt (Lose the mustache and beard!) looks at ease playing the cocky, over-eager kid cop.  Gwyneth Paltrow has a small part as Pitt's wife who encounters the serial killer later in the film.  The killer is played by Kevin Spacey as a quiet, intelligent, insane madman.<br /><br />The direction and photography are top-notch.  The pace is quick, there are no wasted speeches or scenes.  Because we know there will be seven murders, we are expecting, but never quite prepared for, the horrific crime scenes.  The ending took me by surprise, which is always good.  I recommend Seven for viewers who want blood, gore, and excellent acting.</p></body></html>

I first looked at the cover art and read the liner notes and thought "here we go with a real-B movie, sigh". I started watching and it was funny and interesting. Watching the Blu-Ray I was really impressed with the image quality--super sharp and clear, it looked almost like video rather than film. So early-on, I'm thinking this is a spoof movie, but no, it was a straight fantasy/comedy movie. Then it hit me! This is a tribute to the Ray Harryhousen movie (Sinbad). Then I noticed this movie has everything from stop-action creatures, alot of rubber suits and alot of real models of creatures. Yeah, some CG, but not much. It really has the look and feel of the old Sinbad movies.<br /><br />The plot is of a "S-mart" sales guy getting transported to the 1300's to fight against Deadites and recover an artifact book. Bruce Campbell did an outstanding job in the lead role. This movie was a pleasure to watch. Stupid comedy in places, old-style effects, silly quest and it is all fun fun fun! This is on my watch-it-again list.</p></body></html>

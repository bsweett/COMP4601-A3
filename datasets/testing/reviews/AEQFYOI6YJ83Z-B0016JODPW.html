He and his brother Hank are both in financial trouble; Hank has a daughter to provide for, and Andy has some accounts he needs to settle at his firm.  The solution: Rob a mom and pop jewelry store.  Not just ANY mom and pop jewelry store, however--the jewelry store owned by Andy and Hank's parents.  It's the perfect crime: they know the layout of the place, they know who works and when...what could go wrong?<br /><br />A lot.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once again that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood today, plain and simple.  He oozes greaseball charm.  Ethan Hawke reeled me right in--amazing, considering I've never been a big fan of his.  Albert Finney is a wonder to behold.  Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan (who, let's be honest, plays one of the best b****es in town) are both greatly underused, which is one of this movie's two main flaws.<br /><br />The other flaw?  The transition between scenes gets old fast.  The movie jumps back and forth through time--not an astounding concept, and we can put up with it if it's done correctly.  But here, it just seems a bit forced.  Smoother transitions would have been prefered, definitely.<br /><br />Still...the writing is sharp, and Sidney Lumet's directing is dead-on.  With superb casting, a brilliant script, and a unique and interesting plot, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is one of the must-see movies out there.  See it and be moved.</p></body></html>

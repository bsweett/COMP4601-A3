How often does a bad movie have a sequel that is a vast improvement over the first movie.  Well it happened here.  In fact the second ST movie is my number 1 ST movie ever, though first contact was a temping alternate choice.  But, if WOK had been a second dude, would that have been the end of star trek?  I am glad we will never know.  Shatner is great in this and Montalban may have had his best role as khan in this movie.  We also learn the secret of kirks success in &#65533;cheating&#65533; death.  He CHEATS DEATH by the book.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A terrific film about growing up and high-school football"></head><body><p>Almost everything works in this portrait of the madness for and around<br />high-school football in a small Texas town.<br /><br />One of the best sports movies I've seen, largely because it's not really about<br />the sport, or the big game, or winning and losing.  It's about growing up, letting<br />go of dreams, the pressure adults put on kids to fulfill their own dreams, losing<br />perspective and gaining it.  It seems to try and honestly look at both sides of high<br />school football; how it helps young men grow, challenge themselves and bond,<br />but at the same time how it subjects them to physical harm, an unrealistic set of<br />expectations about life after being a local star, and being forced to carry a whole<br />town on your shoulders when you're only 17.<br /><br />Some terrific visuals, both in the quick cutting ferocity of the games, and in the<br />long aerial views of the empty Texas plains.<br /><br />It does cheat in a few moments, trying to have it's cake and eat it too - a few plot<br />lines are resolved a touch too easily or neatly, a few plot twists feel too familiar<br />from other films.  And I understand those that say the film displays a superior<br />attitude towards these small town people.  But I found those weaker moments<br />fleeting in a film that surprised me with the strength of it's acting, writing, and filmmaking.</p></body></html>

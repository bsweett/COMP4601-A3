Adventure has a new name? - so reads the tagline, and to be honest it's about time something new came along to replace the likes of Indiana Jones, and James Bond (against whom it is difficult not to draw comparisons). Matthew McConaughy is suitably charming and buffed as the handsome adventurer / treasure hunter alongside Steve Zahn's able but bewildered sidekick Al, in this global trek to find a phantom Iron Clad ship from the civil war that has somehow ended up in Africa. This obssession of Pitt's of course enrages his sponsor and employer Admiral Sandecker (superb casting William H Macy)who outwardly only tolerates his best asset but cares with a veiled admiration. The crew happen to be in Africa of course on another salvage operation, when they get a whiff of the Iron Clads possible location, but things take a turn however, when they must intervene to save Dr Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) who is on the run from the local warring factions after discovering illegal toxic dumping. The threeway escapade takes off with plenty of high jinks, action and adventure in a wholesome but believable way which is both refreshing and entertaining. Clive Cusslers novel may not have been represented to the satisfaction of the puritan fans, but the sober undertones of the story and one or two serious moments, do much to help keep this light romp on the ground. More than a buddy movie (although many cliches are apparent) this is a good contemporary story, and McConnaughy represents an ideal Action Icon for a modern audience. The reasonable success of the picture will undoubtedly pave the way for a myriad of sequels, but for now sit down, grab the popcorn and enjoy some old fashioned action and fun brought bang up to date.

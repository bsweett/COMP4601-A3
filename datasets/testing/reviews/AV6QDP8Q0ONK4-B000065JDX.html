This is an excellent film which includes quirky characters, great dialouge, with memorable scenes and lines. A different type of Tarantino movie: no flashbacks. Clooney and Tarantino play criminal brothers. Tarantino is the psychotic of the two and Clooney has to deal with him, reminding me of a Steinbeck novel that has nothing to do with this film.<br /><br />Tarantino demonstrates he is as talented in front of the camera as he is behind. Of course if you are the type of person who doesn't like cheesy topless vampire strippers, then you have no need to watch this film.<br /><br />F-bomb, off screen rape, blood, gore, strip club nudity, naked feet.</p></body></html>

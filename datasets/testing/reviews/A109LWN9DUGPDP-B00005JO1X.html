<meta name="summary" content="Probly the best looking Blu ray"></head><body><p>Although Narnia is far from my favorite genre of a film its a really good movie none the less,as for the the blu ray version all I can say is way to go Disney.Maybe it doesn't have all the special features as the four disc released previously but there is plenty here to keep you busy.Now to the nuts and bolts of the blu ray release,what most wonder most.Is this a good blu ray? Is it really worth the price to have on blu ray.Well if your like me and you enjoy terrific looking blu's with some great audio then yes,yes,yes.I'm thinking of some of the better looking blu rays I own and watched and I'm thinking of some of the greats in the video quality like Swordfish yes Swordfish if you enjoy the best blu ray quality than Swordfish in my opinion is probly the best in terms of video quality.Lets see then there is I Robot,Kingdom Of Heaven,Flyboys,Troy,Blood Diamond to name a few.All these I consider to be some of if not the best demo video material for Blu ray disc.Now we have Narnia and Narnia meets or beats any of the above stated blu disc for quality,the the video is what you expect a "HD" disc to look like plain and simple.There is so many brilliant colors and nice epic settings in this movie and Disney did one fine job for the blu ray realease.The audio has one of my personel favorite audio tracks the 5.1<br />uncompressed and its done well here also.I know its alot for me to go on typing about here considering Narnia isn't my favorite genre of films but this is a blu ray that does indeed deserve the respect.</p></body></html>

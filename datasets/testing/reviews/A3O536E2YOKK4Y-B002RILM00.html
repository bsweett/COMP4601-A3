They make Neil LaBute's 2006 remake of "The Wicker Man" out to be an incredulous turkey of astronomical proportions on the level of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "American Beauty." Well, I just saw it twice -- both the widescreen theatrical cut and the full screen cut with the Director's alternative ending -- and I can safely tell you that it's all a bunch of malarkey.<br /><br />First of all, let's be honest about the original 1973 version: Yes, it's a unique and original film in multiple ways and has numerous strengths, including fine Scottish locations and the presence of Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt (the former's siren-like "How Do" song & dance is a definite highlight), but it's certainly not the masterpiece that many claim. What's wrong with it? For one thing, the protagonist Edward Woodward (Sgt. Howie) is incredibly annoying and unlikable; he comes off as a self-rigteous, Pharasaical tighty-righty (this is how he struck me and I'm a Christian!). This is a serious flaw when you consider that the entire film focuses on Woodward's progressive search for the missing girl. In addition, Christopher Lee is just 'there' as Lord Summerisle (which, I know, is blasphemy to Lee fans since Lee considered his part in "Wicker Man" his personal best). The biggest problem with the original is that the film plays out in a dull way; the plot itself is interesting, but the delivery is less than compelling.<br /><br />Woodward is so unlikable and annoying that, on some subconscious level, I was almost glad with his outcome at the end. Which brings up another criticism of the original film: I simply didn't find the ending horrifying. It was supposed to be, but somehow it wasn't.<br /><br />One last criticism of the 1973 original is that it's understandably dated. It's obvious a product of the free-love hippie era and it shows. If any film screamed out for a remake this was it. I was therefore looking foward to Neil LaBute's 2006 version.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The story in this new version switches to America. Nicholas Cage plays a California cop searching for his ex-fiance's daughter on a mysterious privately owned island in Washington's Puget Sound. The society is backwards, pagan and matriarchal in nature; the men are mute and second class. As the film progresses Cage comes to see that the inhabitants are lying to him about the girl's disappearance.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: First of all, unlike Woodward, Cage is likable as the protagonist (or, at least, we can relate to him). His mounting frustration and anger over the situation are understandable. When he ultimately turns to outright violence against the women, we understand what has driven him to such actions.<br /><br />The British Columbian locations are good, pretty much on a par with the Scottish locations of the original in their own unique way.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is better than Christopher Lee as the villain. We don't even meet her until a full hour into the film and she fittingly comes off as a creepy religious psycho (just because she's pagan doesn't mean she's not religious). Lee was bland in the original.<br /><br />Molly Parker as the school teacher and Leelee Sobieski are quite fetching (with Kate Beahan a distant third). Molly and Leelee are fully clothed at all times and yet somehow ooze beauty. Molly, in particular, has a very unique loveliness to her. One reviewer complained that there weren't any scenes of naked women as was frequently the case in the original, but the director didn't feel the need to go the softcore porn route. Lebute expertly shows that true beauty is far more than numerous displays of softcore eroticism and overt nudity. If you want that rent a porn video.<br /><br />The story is entertaining, fun and, at times, even unintentionally hilarious. For instance, the scene where Cage talks with the "barmaid" and the patrons has some laugh-out-loud aspects. There are numerous other humorous moments (Cage apprehending the bicycle: "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!", running around in a bear costume, the dead girl suddenly appearing in his arms on the dock, numerous hilarious lines like "OH NO, NOT THE BEES, NOT THE BEES!!", etc.) but the picture somehow maintains a serious aura. The original, by contrast, was dead-pan serious and never entertained in this manner.<br /><br />The ending is horrifying (WAY more so than the original), even though I knew it was coming. If you're in the right mood it can also be funny. The alternate ending is even better with the inclusion of overt torture scenes (although I know why they cut one of the torture scenes, the bees would have killed Cage since he was allergic to them). The Wicker Man prop is intimidating and over twice the size of the original.<br /><br />In the theatrical version there's a "6 months later" coda tacked on, which is an important scene. It shows how pre-meditated the actions of the women are in the film. It also explains one of Leelee's mysterious lines earlier in the story, "When you leave, take me with you." This sequence shouldn't have been cut from the alternate ending.<br /><br />The DVD, incidentally, features the theatrical cut on one side and the alternative-ending cut on the other. Unfortunately the vocal track is slightly off on the alternative cut. There's also a trailer and a decent commentary track with the director, Leelee, Kate and one other person (I didn't listen to the entire commentary, but what I did hear was informative).<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The search-in-the-barn sequence is pretty useless, but adds to the mounting mystery. Also, the story really bogs down in the graveyard scene where Cage and Kate have a heart-to-heart talk.<br /><br />Some people may look down on the film because of the numerous unintentionally funny scenes noted above. I think it makes it more entertaining. If you don't agree with me STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!!<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: Both the 1973 and 2006 versions of "The Wicker Man" are 4/5 Star films and are equally valuable for their positive aspects noted above. The insane criticisms of the remake are unwarranted (remakes are, of course, a lose-lose situation: if the film in question is remade frame for frame like "Psycho" people complain, and if the filmmakers deviate from the original they'll complain even more; you can't win). The fact is that the 1973 version is severely dated and NEEDED to be remade, and this is a good updating. I wasn't disappointed. It's definitely worth catching if you like mounting mystery stories with creepy, horrifying elements. On top of this there are numerous humorous aspects. And, thankfully, the protagonist isn't some irritating religionist with a corncob stuck up his arse.<br /><br />Lastly, you won't understand unless you see it but this remake is destined to become a cult classic -- loved or reviled, it's entertaining.</p></body></html>

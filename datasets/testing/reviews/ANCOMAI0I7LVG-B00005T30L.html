What I love so much about `Ghost World' is that it understands that balance between humor and heart, and it knows that the darkest realities of loneliness and alienation use sarcasm and wit to mask themselves.  `Ghost World' feels richly honest.  This is certainly not a film that everyone will fall head over heels for; the humor alone is an acquired taste (not everyone will `get it' or find it funny) but for those of us who do `get it', this is a beautiful piece of cinema.  Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi are all spectacular here, especially Buscemi, who tears at the heart in ways unexpected.  Birch and Johansson find the normalcy in Clowes biting dialog, handling their lines with an ease that is richly rewarding.  The beautiful core of `Ghost World' lies in the idea that growing up comes in stages and is, as we all can attest to, very hard to do.  As the central characters are fleshed out (Enid, Rebecca and Seymour all get their room to shine) we see them interact and play off one another, and the true `thickness' of their relationships is tested and exposed.  Life isn't easy, and making that transition from childhood to adulthood is one of the hardest avenues of life.  For me, there are few films that can capture the emotional impact of the experience with as much style as `Ghost World'.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well-made Homage to Old Films, But Lacks Originality"></head><body><p>The only original point about 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' is that: A) the entire film was made with CGIs, the cast being shot against the blue screen; so Empire State Building you see is just a trick of modern technology.<br /><br />And B) the film is virtually nothing but a homage to countless old films -- 'Metropolis,' 'The Third Man,' and many many others.  You may be absolutely enthralled, seeing the old-fashioned visuals refined and remodeled to the modern taste, or just unimpressed.  Sorry, but I belong to the latter category.<br /><br />The plot is silm (the film is basically an extention of 6 minute film the director made privately on his PC) -- so silm that in the second half it makes little sense.  It's about Sky Captain, intrepid pilot of fighter plane between the two world wars, and a newsreporter Polly Perkins, who seeks for the juicy story holding a camera.  They are involved with an international plot by one German scientist, and they come to know it soon after the city is under attack by many robots (ala 'The War of the World').<br /><br />Captain is played by Jude Law, Polly by Gwyneth Paltrow.  They look great on screen, like the stars of the 30s Hollywood, but don't expect any emotions, or chemstry, between them.  The film suggests they were formerly in love with each other, and will be again, but the lack of romantic feeling between the thin characters cannot be disguised.  And as supports, Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Gambon, Bai Ling (totally unrecognizable), and Angelina Jolie appear, but Ms. Jolie's role is just an extended cameo, just in case.<br /><br />In spite of interesting visuals, good costumes (by Stella McCartney, Paul's daughter), and rousing music, 'Sky Captain' remains the well-made sample of the director's flair for visuals.  The visuals themselves are good, I assure you, but the novelty soon wears off, and Kerry Conran still has many things to learn especially when it comes to inducing the actors to give their best shot.  In some scenes, the actors (Ms. Paltrow in particular) stares at somewhere in the air blankly, as if looking at nothing (of course, they are watching nothing in reality).<br /><br />Can he handle the humans as well as visuals?  Next time he will be tested, and until then, 'Sky Captain' remains a very good demo tape by a very promising director.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of Burton's Best"></head><body><p>Tim Burton will always be one of my favorite directors. While his library is not perfect, he is one of the greatest story tellers in film history. With worlds of the outlandish and incredible heartfilled characters there was no doubt that Disney would call upon him for bringing one of the most beloved childrens tales to life, in Alice In Wonderland.<br /><br />Now, in order to truly appreciate this film you need to know your Alice 101. If you have never read the two Alice books (yes not many people know there were two books) Or if you haven't seen the 1953 Disney animated film, chances are this will not be the best experience for you. What makes this film so great is that Tim Burton wanted to give his audience something fresh, so he made his very own unoffical 3rd Installment. This Alice In Wonderland is sort of what Stephen Speilberg's Hook did for Peter Pan. In Tim Burtons' fims whether good or bad his cast is always great (most of the time because it's the same). The best performances here have come from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Cater filling in the shoes and head of the Red Queen gives you a true 'you love to hate me' character. Johnny Depp turns on his Jack Sparrow/Willy Wonka charm, but kicks it up one huge knotch. The only beef I had with this movie I think the CGI was a tad overdone. Sure we have come to an age where the CGI is king. Still, you compare it to so many of the Burton films before, the lack of CGI just made them all the more whimsical. Still, the movie is entertaing and so much fun to watch. I would say proceed with caution if you haven't caught up on the story in a while. If you are an Alice fan, it will be a good one for you.</p></body></html>

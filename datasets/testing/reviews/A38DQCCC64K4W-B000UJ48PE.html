<meta name="summary" content="If You Liked The First....."></head><body><p>This was a nice continuation of part 1; Loose ends are tied up, and we got to see a little more into the business side of this extremely disturbing 'industry'; The eBay-like auction sequence for people was quite amusing; I would have like to have seen the inner workings of this 'business' just a little more. There are several nice surprises, and Roth is a very skilled director who just gets better w/each picture. The consumerism thread will be lost on some, but that's okay. Roth has created a tense, great looking horror film; And while it's not quite as good as part 1, it's def. a worthy follow-up. It takes the premise of part 1 and expands it into other areas; There is one really horrific sequence in here I could have done without(the first torture sequence, literally a bloodbath...), but this sort of stuff just comes with the territory nowadays. Great stuff for those who liked the first and can stomach more of the same...and then some. Poor Paxton.</p></body></html>

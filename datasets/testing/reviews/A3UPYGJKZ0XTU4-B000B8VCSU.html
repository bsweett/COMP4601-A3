<meta name="summary" content="Conventional But Entertaining Eminem Vehicle"></head><body><p>Rapper Eminem portrays Detroit factory worker and street rapper "B. Rabbit" in this poor-boy-makes-good story based loosely on Eminem's own life. Rabbit desperately wants to make a demo tape of his music and rap his way out of the trailer park and into a better life. He must cope with his venomous alcoholic mother, manipulative friends, neighborhood thugs, and overcome his own intense stage fright in order to get respect for his work and a shot at exposure. Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's most loyal and sensible friend who pushes him to do better and has unfailing confidence in Rabbit's ability to succeed. Brittany Murphy is Rabbit's unfaithful but supportive love interest Alex. And Kim Basinger plays Rabbit's dysfunctional mother, with whom he shares a love-hate relationship.<p>The verdict is still out on whether Eminem can act. Eminem is certainly convincing in his role, but I am under the impression that B. Rabbit is too close to the rapper's own experience to be an accurate judge of acting talent. Eminem's rapping talent and charisma are not in question. Even the uninitiated will be convinced that he has plenty of both, and tremendous screen presence as well. Fans of Curtis Hanson may be surprised that the director has made such a conventional  film. That's a little surprising coming from Eminem too. But the fact is that 8 Mile is a smart public relations move on Eminem's part. This is mainstream fair, complete with a mainstream crossover soundtrack. It's good mainstream fair, as is the soundtrack. And B. Rabbit is sweet enough and politically correct enough in his attitudes towards women, homosexuals and his loser friends to assuage middle-class audiences into thinking Eminem is a decent guy. I'm not saying that he isn't. I'm only saying that 8 Mile is less a convincing portrait of inner city poverty and salvation in music as it is a trailer park fairy tale, constructed in a very cliched fashion, to promote -some would say whitewash- Eminem's image for a wider audience. -Which is fine. It's an entertaining film, and Eminem has great presence. But we haven't seen the frank, brilliant, hateful Eminem who is so loved and so loathed on the silver screen yet. And who knows if we ever will.</p></body></html>

I mean once that girl says she wants to have a sex change it is down hill. While too many movies suffer the fate of creative bankruptcy, Being John Malkovich is a refreshing study in contrast, so bracingly original that you'll want to send director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman a thank-you note for restoring your faith in the enchantment of film. Even if it ultimately serves little purpose beyond the thrill of comedic invention, this demented romance is gloriously entertaining, spilling over with ideas that tickle the brain and even touch the heart. This had an interesting concept that could of worked, but it looks like there were to different writers. One wanted to right a comedy, and the other wanted to write an episode for tales from the crypt, then both ideas were smashed together and were totally ruined. This is the only John Cusack film I didn't like. Anyway, puppeteer's working as a file clerk on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan office building; this idea alone might serve as the comedic basis for an entire film, but Jonze and Kaufman are just getting started. They then totally turn the whole thing around into some and stupid film full of mindless sex scenes and then it finally ceases to be funny and just becomes stupid, so I recommend seeing something else like Say Anything or Better Off Dead, those are actually funny through out the duration of the film!</p></body></html>

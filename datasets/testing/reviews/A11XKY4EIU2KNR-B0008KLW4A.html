So what do the genious minds from Hollywood present us with almost 15 years later? A Cat Woman movie. How unoriginal.<br /><br />Well in the 90's Hollywood's gas tank was on empty, we had a decade of movies made from long dead TV shows (Beverly Hillbillies, Brady Bunch, etc.) We still have it today with Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch. To mix it up a bit, the suits are now presenting us with an endless supply of Marvel Comic Superheros. Spider-Man, good. Hulk, bad. Cat Woman? Bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />The title of this movie could have been "Watch Halle Berry run around in a cat-suit, you know you want to". That's really about it. I'm not a Halle Berry fan. I don't think she's all that. Maybe she would look better if she wore her hair like a woman.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rambling. If you are a Halle Fan you will see this no matter what anyone says. If you are a leather fetishest, you will to. So why does anyone bother to review this?</p></body></html>

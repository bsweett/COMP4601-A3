<meta name="summary" content="HANNIBAL TAKES ANTHROPOPHAGY TO A NEW LEVEL.."></head><body><p>This is a well acted film with marvelous performances by the entire cast. Julianne Moore, reprising Jodie Foster's role as FBI agent, Clarissa Starling, is superlative, and Anthony Hopkins, as Hannibal Lecter, is once again sublime. The supporting cast, which includes Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini, are also terrific. The problem with the movie is not with the cast, but with its penchant for trying to shock the audience with gore and monstrous scenes of anthroprophagy that revolt, rather than merely shock, the viewer.<p>Ten years after his escape from custody, Hannibal Lecter resurfaces in Florence, Italy, of all places. After him is Mr. Mason, a fabulously wealthy, but disgusting piece of human vermin and former moltester of children, who was horribly disfigured many years ago with a little help from Hannibal who had been his psychiatrist. He is on the hunt for Hannibal as is, of course, Starling. Who will get to Hannibal first or, better yet, who will Hannibal get to first, is the question that begs to be answered. Unfortunately, Liotta, as a greedy Departman of Justice spokesperson and Giannini, as a greedy Italian police officer, get in Hannibal's way by providing assistance to Mr. Mason, much to their detriment, as the viewer will find out.<p>While given to some excess, this is still an interesting film. Despite his proclivity for human flesh, Anthony Hopkins manages to make Hannibal Lecter everything anyone could ever hope for in a dinner companion: exquisitely mannered, cultured, intelligent, and charming. Just make sure that you are not the main course. <p>This movie is definitely not for the squeamish.</p></body></html>

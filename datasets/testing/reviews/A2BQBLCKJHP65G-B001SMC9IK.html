But where 50's classics like The Fly, The Thing, The Blob, and most recently War Of The Worlds all benefited from the redo, this one just sucks the life out of the original story. Not that the original was all that great to begin with (admit it, all you really remember about it is that prehistoric Cylon known as Gort), but for a story about the forced alien extinction of mankind to save the planet Earth itself, all I could help thinking was I hope the aliens DO get to hit our restart button. And as for that cast, Reeves is even more wooden than usual, Smith Jr. needs a few seasons on Nickelodeon first, and Connelly should rip up that paycheck she knows is the only reason she showed up for this. And about the main event Gort, how can a movie almost 60 years older have a robot on-screen look more realistic?!!? Honestly it deserved to bomb like a fallen blue marble outta the sky for no reason and further shows sometimes you just can't rewrite history. Someone please split my atoms to a better movie now....<br />(RedSabbath Rating:4.0/10).</p></body></html>

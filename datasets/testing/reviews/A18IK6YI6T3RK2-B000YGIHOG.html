<meta name="summary" content="UH VERY CREEPY"></head><body><p>Let me say right off this film is creepy as hellz, it's sort of has a low budget feel, which makes it seem very real.  It's amazingly violent and from the start you know your in for a disturbing ride.  At times, the violence seems gratuitous, and one scene where one of the main characters attacks the other is really disturbing.  For what it is, it succeeds, frankly if you looking for a creepy apocolyptic horror film you'll probably be pleases, but otherwise you might out to skip this or be forewarned, you may have trouble sleeping afterwards, it's that creepy.</p></body></html>

I'm sure most people know the storyline by now you have a young teenage girl Juno who after having sex gets pregnant and now after a while of thinking it over decides to have the baby full term and than give the baby up to a surrogate couple.  For me I couldn't seem to care less what happened to Juno or the baby I know it sounds mean but the storyline they used has been done over many times and a lot more better than this trashy movie.  The soundtrack also was pretty pathetic except for one or two but all in all the songs they used by this one singer Kimya Dawson made me want to put this dvd in the garbage disposer.  To people who are looking for a heart-felt movie similar to this I say try checking out Natalie Portman's movie Where The Heart Is I guarantee you that would be a much better choice than this cornball dvd.</p></body></html>

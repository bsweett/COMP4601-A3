<meta name="summary" content="A tongue-in-cheek classic"></head><body><p>Ignore the naysayers here and watch this movie on a big screen, with a good surround sound system cranked up nice and loud. This is a full-on modern cinematic rollercoaster ride, made purely for fun, and it delivers in spades.<br /><br />Essentially a melange of Dracula, Frankenstein, and James Bond, with occasional soupcons of various and sundry genre touches, Van Helsing is a feast for the eyes and ears, and damn funny to boot. I came in expecting nothing, and was well and truly blown away.<br /><br />The effects are flawless, the story quite hilarious, and the overall tone suggests Raiders of the Lost Ark of Transylvania. Jackman and Beckinsale are tailor-made and work well together. Roxburgh gives one of the most hilarious villain performances in screen history, perfectly over the top; his moments alone are worth seeing the film for. I rarely watch recent movies more than once; I've seen this four times in a year and it keeps getting more impressive with each viewing.<br /><br />This is a superb piece of craftsmanship that never takes itself too seriously, and delivers massive doses of fun and many thrilling moments. A better flick for a cold and snowy Saturday's eve would be hard to find.<br /><br />Give it some time; Van Helsing will be a cult classic yet.</p></body></html>

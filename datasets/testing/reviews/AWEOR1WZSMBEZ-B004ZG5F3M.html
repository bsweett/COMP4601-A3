<meta name="summary" content="Deliciously sinful --- eat in moderation :-)"></head><body><p>Even back in the 1950's, in this quaint old-fashioned French town, they considered chocolate as an 'indulgence'. No, they were not concerned with the possible weight gain or health problems brought about by eating excessive amounts of chocolate.  They deemed this treat as a temptation, &amp; since it brings too much pleasure to the eater, they (particularly the town's mayor) considered it grave &amp; sinful.  <p>As a viewer, I would deem the 'chocolat' as something intoxicating &amp; liberating.  It represents anything that would bring pleasure to the human senses.  True, it unleashed passion &amp; sensuality among couples.  But it also signified something deeper than skin-deep gratification.  It also represented anything that would liberate the town folks from their fears, insecurities, loneliness &amp; prejudices --- whether it be directly or indirectly.<p>Like chocolate, culture &amp; religion come in different forms...some are common &amp; widely accepted while others are a bit different &amp; stand out like a sore thumb.  But, also like chocolate, uniqueness adds to its beauty.  <p>So the next time you find yourself staring at a box of chocolate, do not judge its beauty simply by its shape or packaging.  Why don't you cut out on your prejudices, broaden your horizons, widen your options &amp; enjoy the experience of a mouth-watering treat.  <p>How about one of those melt-in-you-mouth-not-in-your-hand chocs?</p></body></html>

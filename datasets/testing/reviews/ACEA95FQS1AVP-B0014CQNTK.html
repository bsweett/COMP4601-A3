<meta name="summary" content="3.5 Stars, too much hype..."></head><body><p>I think all the media stories, Oscar buzz, interviews, and hype set the bar on this movie so high I couldn't help but be disappointed.  When I saw previews and commercials for it, my first thought was "they put all the funny clips into those spots".  And I wasn't completely wrong.  There were a few other funny scenes, most notably with Allison Janney, but the rest of the movie was kinda slow.<br /><br />After one night of unprotected sex, Juno discovers she's pregnant.  She goes for an abortion, but can't bring herself to go through with it.  She finds an ad in the paper for adoptive parents and decides to give the baby up.  From that point, viewers jump from scene to scene as Juno's pregnancy progresses.  Kids at school stare; she has an ultrasound (a very good scene wherein Janney tells the technician off for being judgmental); she visits the adoptive parents; she hangs out; etc.  Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Juno herself, all the other characters are VERY two-dimensional.  The boyfriend is a bit of a nerd who doesn't have a lot to say.  Juno's best friend is a ditz who's got a crush on a teacher.  And ALL the kids speak with the  stereotypical "these are teens, they have their own jargon" crap.  At one point I was tempted to start the movie over just so I could count the number of times they say "dude."  I know that teens do have a lot of common idioms they use, but this felt like I was watching "That 70's Show." (the visual art direction of the film reinforced this as well). I think Juno was supposed to come off as very mature (or wise) in her worldview, but at the same time she had unprotected sex and chose adoptive parents out of the newspaper.  JK Simmons was wasted in his part and could've offered more to the movie as a supportive but disappointed dad.  Same for Allison Janney.  Of course, the perfect couple who wants to adopt is only perfect on paper. I think this was meant to be a source of conflict for the movie, but just didn't measure up.  Viewers are supposed to feel some pity, I think, for the husband who obviously has no common interests with his wife, is being rushed into fatherhood, and never got to pursue his dreams.  All I could do was agree with his wife, "grow up."  She wasn't even two-dimensional - successful business woman who wants a baby, that's it.  Since the couple is a such minor piece of the movie, it didn't matter that much.<br /><br />However, the film wasn't all bad.  It had a good message, showing the very real and negative side of teen pregnancy, physical as well as psychological.  And I like how they emphasized how many people are desperate to adopt because they can't have children of their own.  Yet, the film managed to avoid being a moral indictment.  She made a mistake, but dealt with the consequences as best she could.  Juno is a very likeable and spunky character that made this movie better than it would've been.  Ellen Paige deserves kudos for her acting, but the screenplay didn't deserve all those accolades.  There were some very funny scenes and the ending was well done.  Yet, this didn't succeed as a comedy. And, I don't think it succeeded as a look into a teen's life (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00013RC2K">Thirteen</a>).  Overall, I think it would have been better as a made-for-tv movie.  It was worth seeing, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.</p></body></html>

The movie is cleverly plotted and stars a wonderful cast.  the highlight of the movie has to be Oscar winner Kevin Spacey.  He plays his part brilliantly well.<br /><br />The DVD itself is also top botch, with two cmmentaries, a number of deleted scenes and some featurettes.  Definitely must have.</p></body></html>

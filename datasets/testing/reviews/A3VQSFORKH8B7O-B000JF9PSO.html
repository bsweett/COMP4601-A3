<meta name="summary" content="9/11 HITS THE BIG SCREEN IN POWERFUL FILM!"></head><body><p>Hard on the heels of last January's TV Movie "Flight 93," acclaimed filmmaker Paul Greengrass brought his own variation of the fate of the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 to the screen, in the first theatrical feature to deal with the events of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />After seeing the television film, I thought it would be hard for any film, even a theatrical feature, to match the power and emotional charge that the first film had. But "United 93" succeeds with flying colors. A totally different approach all together, Greengrass depicts the events from the plane, with no dramatic imbellishment. This gives the film an immeadiacy that truly puts the viewer on the plane with these men and women. This is what gives "United 93" it's power. The scenes of air traffic controllers and military personnel trying to figure out what is happening on that fateful Tuesday morning are equally harrowing.<br /><br />The cast and crew do a fantastic job of recreating this tragic event of recent history, while showing the bravery of the men and women who fought to re-take Flight 93, and prevent possibly hundreds more from being murdered.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, both as a reminder of that fateful day, and as a reminder of what we are fighting to prevent from happening again.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

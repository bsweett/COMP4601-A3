And black leather?"></head><body><p>Jurassic Park is good entertainment, but take most of the "science" it presents with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Innovative in its presentation of realistic looking dinosaurs, Jurassic Park is the name of a new dinosaur-based theme park that is sabotaged while a few scientists and kids are on a pre-opening tour. It becomes an adventure to see who will escape alive.<br /><br />Mostly good acting by Laura Dern and Sam Neill as dino experts, Jeff Goldblum as the chaos theory mathematician, and Richard Attenborough as the park designer. The kids, played competently by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello had some of the best lines.<br /><br />All the characters seem to think the idea of cloning dinosaurs is a good idea except Goldblum who wonders if we should do what we (in the movie) apparently can do.<br /><br />An entertaining adventure, but no big concept. Not quite the same level as Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Jaws. The movie is best when there are dinosaurs on screen.<br /><br />The only nit-picks include wondering why Jeff Goldblum wears black leather to the tropics, and why a pre-teen girl can save the day on a complex computer (again - see S1m0ne) with her knowledge of UNIX.<br /><br />DVD has wide-screen movie, a behind the scenes documentary, and a few other minimal goodies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beyond and under"></head><body><p>"Beyond the Sea" opened the same year as another bio-pic of a classic musical talent, "De Lovely." This was Kevin Spacey's pet project. Unfortunately, "Sea" doesn't manage to be much more than that -- it feels bloodless and overstuffed, and we never get to know any of the people in it.<br /><br />It opens with Darin (Spacey) filming a movie about himself, and generally acting like a diva -- and being interrupted by the specter of himself as a young boy. Cue cringes.<br /><br />His story shoots back to see himself as a critically ill, fatherless child, whose "mother" (actually his grandmother) says he'll be bigger than Sinatra. Despite the odds, he becomes a massive star, even shooting a Hollywood movie alongside Rock Hudson and Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth).<br /><br />He marries the beautiful girl after a whirlwind courtship, and after a rocky start, all seems to be going well -- they have a child, wealth, and a beautiful home. But then his "sister" reveals that she is his biological mother, and Bobby falls to pieces. Now he sets out to find himself -- as a person, and as a musician.<br /><br />"Beyond the Sea" is both too long and too short -- it only looks at a few parts of Darin's life, and yet it feels overstuffed. The story itself focuses on only a few aspects of Darin's life, but it pushes them so hard that Darin himself -- and the entirety of his life -- get lost in the muddle.<br /><br />And while some movies could have managed, "Beyond the Sea" doesn't. It skips the entire latter half of Darin's life -- divorce, teen idol phase, mother's death, et cetera -- so we can hear more about how Darin was sick as a kid, and how finding out about Mom messed him up forever. The movie feels like a series of unconnected scenes that are strung together on those plot threads.<br /><br />Worse, Spacey is a very awkward writer/director -- that horribly Broadway-style opener proves it. There are a few good moments, like Darin dedicating a song to his mother. But most of the movie is awkward or even laughable, such as the scene where Darin does his "knight of Camelot" routine in the bedroom. I dare you not to laugh at that -- or at seriously delivered lines like, "Memories are like moonbeams, we do with them what we will."<br /><br />Despite his directorial shortcomings, Spacey makes a decent Darin -- he has some onstage charisma, and he sings nicely, and does a tolerable job in most of the other scenes. He even includes Darin's snipey behavior ("Let me tell you something, blondie, you're not exactly Audrey Hepburn!"). But Bosworth seems to be sleepwalking in her role, and the "young Bobby" is simply awful.<br /><br />"Beyond the Sea" could have been a good movie, even with the awkward direction. But in the end, it fails to do one important thing: Tell us about Bobby Darin's life.</p></body></html>

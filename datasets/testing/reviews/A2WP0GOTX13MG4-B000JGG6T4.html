Washington plays Creasy, a former marine that is haunted by the those things he had to do in service to his country.  He struggles with God and agonizes over his past.  This malaise has manifested in a drinking problem.  On a trip to Mexico, Creasy meets up a comrade named Rayburn, played by Christopher Walken.  Rayburn encourages Creasy to take a job in Mexico City.<br /><br />Apparently, there is a severe kidnapping problem in Mexico.  Many prominent businessmen take out kidnapping policies on themselves and their families.  One of the requirements of the insurance policy is that they hire a bodyguard.  Creasy is hired by Samuel, played by Marc Anthony, at a discounted rate due to Creasy's drinking problem.  Samuel has a daughter named Pita, played by Dakota Fanning, that Creasy is hired specifically to protect.<br /><br />At first, Creasy resists developing a friendship with Pita.  However, he soon softens and develops a mentor role with the young lady.  This mentorship helps redeem Creasy...and then Pita is kidnapped while under Creasy's watch...<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, this is a dark film.  Washington's role is considerably darker than many of his other roles with notable exception of his role in 'Training Day.'  The difference is that despite what Creasy is capable of, he is still likeable.  What Creasy is capable of is some monstrous acts of revenge.<br /><br />Walken, although his role is limited, is also superb.  Unlike some of his recent roles, his performance in this film is comprehenisble and first rate.  Marc Anthony and Dakota Fanning also perform admirably.<br /><br />This movie is about redemption and revenge.  The themes are not subtle in the least.  Fans of revenge flicks will probably enjoy this film.  Those that like action may be a bit disappointed by the pace.  There is some predictability to this film as far as the story goes, but not in the acting.  The second half of the movie is rather gruesome, so it is not recommended to young viewers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There's A Great Message In This Film But It's Not Preachy At All!!---Very Enjoyable!!"></head><body><p>First of, I applaud the brilliance of Jason Reitman who masterfully<br />directed and wrote this film. He is proof that creative genius does<br />sometimes run in families. This film has very adult sensibilities in<br />it's wit & humor, it's weighty & timely subject matter, it's showing of how<br />we tend to compartmentalize our lives and attempt to control things in a way<br />which we think can gaurd us from being hurt, but of course, in the end we<br />are only fooling ourselves. Bottomline is, we are all built to interact<br />and in those interactions, there's going to be joy and there's going to be pain.<br />Nobody gets out of here unscathed, but if we are smart and lucky and take the risk<br />of commiting ourselves to something or someone, then we stand to gain much more<br />than we can ever loose. Out of all of George Clooney's performances so far,<br />I like him in this one the best!---He nails it and you feel for him completely.<br />His performance is supported beautifully by that of Vera Farmiga, who seems to be<br />his perfect female counterpart in his clean, cut & dry, no regrets/no attachments<br />life philosophy...at least it seems that way. (That later twist threw me for a loop!)<br /><br />Anna Kendrick is great as the young over-achiever college grad who, in her way,<br />thinks she has her life and career all mapped out, but she too learns that just when<br />you think you have all the angles figured out, the game of life switches & shifts on you.<br />Jason Bateman is also great in his supporting role as George Clooney's and Anna Kendrick's<br />characters funny but very bottomline boss.<br />I also think it was brilliant of Jason Reitman to use people who have really<br />recently been fired from their jobs for no reason other than the economic downturn,<br />because it adds such depth and reality to their reactions when Clooney's<br />and Kendrick's characters do what it is that they do for a living,<br />which is flying from city to city and being the human resources "heavies" for<br />companies who don't even have the guts to fire their own otherwise loyal and<br />hardworking employees face to face. Many of these people reflect the scenarios<br />of what so many others in this situation have had to deal with....just heart-breaking stuff.<br />This is a great film and deserves all the accolades it's received this year.<br />It gets off some great messages without being preachy about it.<br />A good addition to your DVD collection if you like films with substance and heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great in Double Disc Version"></head><body><p>I made a point of seeing the Film in the theatre and enjoyed it simply because it was so much like a dream experience, a nightmare.That really is the key to what they have on film, the fragmentary nature of the experience and the way the story emulates a dream so closely.The sound in the theatre was great, and the DVD sound is superb. The Camera work is great work  also.<br />Especially on second and third viewings.<br />I watched the Directors cut first, especially since I had seen the thetarical release of the film first and was utterly blown away with the sound , the quality of film, and the things I had remembered.Having a 5.1 system at home, my system is closer to me than the theatre ( but not better than the theatre) so, I can get a loud effect, as well as a full sound effect.Its really mostly in the final third that the major changes are placed, but when seeing the film additional times, the first two thirds are so well crafted and well acted that when they stand up so well, its really a great statement about the film.<br />The DVD is Well Packaged, and looks Great for the extra price.The 5 Cards you get are a great buzz, but did anyone get the "Don't visit Room 1408" Card ? Disc One has only a Few extras, rather few  in fact, but disc two has an abundance including some deletions that show some possible ambiguities in the role of Mr Olin. The Commentary is technically informative , but not, I would say entertaining: it rather shows how the Swedes can produce technically great films,but need good screen writers to do the frontline job.If you like the two different version of the film, skip the Commentary.<br />**<br />Feb 27 2008: This film withstands multiple viewings  and feels as good as the first few viewings. It is fast becoming a favorite like the relatively recent TIME MACHINE, that I have watched MANY times when I want to relax.</p></body></html>

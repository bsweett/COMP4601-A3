<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Definitely a wonderful movie, Chocolat, brings to the screen the story of a wandering mother and daughter as they settle in a small rural post-war French village, open up a chocolaterie and begin affecting the small community/society in a most profound way.<br /><br />As the movie implies there is chocolate and lots of it...<br /><br />The setting is 1959 France, and it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how trust, love, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance.<br /><br />On the negative side, the only setback is the clich&eacute; clash between "conservatism" and "progressivism" and how Vianne falls for the wandering gypsy.<br /><br />Needless to say, Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Alfred Molina's character who as the town's mayor, steals the show!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What else is left to say?"></head><body><p>This is the greatest American film ever made, as entertaining as it is revolutionary. <p>When it was made, Orson Welles tackled a seemingly simple topic, a reflection back on a dead man's search for love and happiness in his life, and made a film that's epic in scope, gorgeous in its visual execution, brilliantly written, incredibly acted. <p>All in all, it's inspiring to filmmakers looking for a great debut film from a new director. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; also works for regular moviegoers just looking for a good drama.<p>Using interviews with all his closest friends and colleagues, Welles uses flashback to create a portrait of the life of millionaire media magnate Charles Foster Kane. Kane was, in conflicting accounts of those who knew him, a man of great character and potential or a wealthy, cold, manipulative scoundrel. <p>What, if anything, can be learned about the man from his last word? What does &quot;Rosebud&quot; mean?<p>The answer makes for good mystery, and it leads the viewer to ask key questions about what defines our lives and gives them meaning.<p>This film is fantastic, one that should be watched once a year to help you keep perspective on life.</p></body></html>

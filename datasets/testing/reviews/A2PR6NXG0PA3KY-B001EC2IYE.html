<meta name="summary" content="Pretentious and Sentimental"></head><body><p>A friend asked me recently if I liked boxing movies, and was surprised when I said yes. But this isn't a boxing movie. It's an ode to Clint Eastwood's self-image. Clint is a great comic actor; he's funny whether he's getting beaten or beating some poor fool to a pulp. In this droning fraud, he does neither. Instead he quotes the poetry of William Butler Yeats. I like poetry and I like boxing, but this is just pretentiousness on the part of an aging actor who has begun to take himself too seriously as a tough guy. Equally pretentious is the performance of Morgan Freeman as God... (or was that another movie...?). In fact the only quality bit in Million Dollar Baby is the performance of Hillary swank, which is almost good enough to save the project. To class this sentimental escape with such great boxing movies as Raging Bull or Cinderella Man is a disgrace and an outrage.</p></body></html>

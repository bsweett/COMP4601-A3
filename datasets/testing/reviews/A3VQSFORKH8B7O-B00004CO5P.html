<meta name="summary" content="&quot;There's to be a colored regiment?!&quot;"></head><body><p>GLORY...is very deserving of all it's praise. It is a fine film full of action and emotion. It also shows that people in the Union treated African Americans the same as  people did in the South. But this isn't why it's a great film. The film's recreation of the time period and the epic reenactments of the battles of Antietam, James Island and Fort Wagner were incredible, and the performances turned in by Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington (in his much deserved Oscar-winning performance), and Morgan Freeman were superb. The DVD also deserves much praise, with documentaries that show the plight of the colored soldier as well as some fine behind-the-scenes material. A film Civil War buffs will cherish forever! Grade: A+</p></body></html>

So a movie pitting the two against each other was just to much for me to resist! Was I disappointed?<br /><br />Hell, no!<br /><br />Despite all the bad rap this movie got as a horror clone to "The Matrix," fighting sequences, guns, the Vampire's black dress, especially, Selene's, this movie is it's own film. Filled with action, great effects, good story line, & fast paced, "Underworld" put a stake right through my heart! Especially good was Michael Sheen's character, "Lucian," feral, but sophisticated, he stole the show as the leader of the Lycans. Also particularly good was Bill Nighy's, "Viktor," one of the three leaders of the Vampire clan. His character was at once commanding, intelligent, & sublimely evil, all that you could want from a Vampire!<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale's main character, "Selene," was very well done in portraying hard determination of hunting Lycan's without mercy, digging out Kraven's plans to take over the Vampire clan using Lycans, but also an undeniable vulnerability toward Scott Speedman's other main character, "Michael Corvin." Michael Corvin was descended from the original immortal, Alexander Corvinus, who the Lycans feel will end the long war between them & the Vampires, by combing the cells of the two species into a super hybrid.<br /><br />Also in this Blu-ray version there is about an extra five minutes of footage that really helps flesh things out.<br /><br />I do have some complaints though. Scott Speedman's, "Michael Corvin" character was the weakest link in the chain acting wise, but I suppose in retrospect this was intended, for he had not a clue what was happing to him. Shane Brolly's character, "Kraven" was shrill & shallow, one wonders how he could orchestrate a coup over the Vampire clan, but also in retrospect, his character seems to fit in with the movie the more times it's viewed. I was disappointed in the lack of tooth & fang Vampire, Lycan confrontation, opting instead for guns & technology, but then again, retrospect wise, we don't fight our wars with sticks & stones anymore, so why should the Vampires & Lycans? One more thing, where are the female Lycans? Not nary a one to be seen in this film? With all this hairy tooth & fang machismo "Rin Tin Tin" going on, I think these male werewolves would enjoy a little soft furry support from a hot Lassie???<br /><br />All in all though, this movie satisfies the horror fan in me, there is some flaws, but only enough for me to fault this movie very little. If you want hot Vampire vs. Werewolf action, this is the place to start!<br /><br />4 stars out of 5 = Classic</p></body></html>

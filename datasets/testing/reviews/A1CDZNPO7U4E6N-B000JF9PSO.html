However, we can't really say we actually know or fully understand what truely took place, or how the events really unfolded aboard all 4 airplanes. However, the good thing about this movie is that it does shed some light on the subject, and it tries to give the people some insight as to what happened. Can anyone honestly say that this movie is completely, without a shadow of a doubt, accurate? Absolutely not! Can anyone honestly say that this is how it happened? Absolutely not! But, this movie does try to give you a pretty good idea. I won't lie, at times this movie is very hard to watch especially knowing how everything turns out. I guess what mostly got to me, is the fact that I knew what I was watching wasn't a movie, or something just for entertainment, but these people actually lost their lives on this plane. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried. I cried to myself thinking that things may have turned out differently if those brave individuals would've just gotten to the cockpit of the plane a little sooner than they did. I cried about the thought of having to call my family and friends to tell them goodbye because I'm about to die. I cried because a whole lot of innocent people suffered and ultimately paid the price for something they had absolutely nothing to do with. This movie also shows you how unprepared and surprised the U.S Government officials were while these events were taking place. This movie cleared up a lot of unanswered questions for me. Like, how could guys with sharpened nail filers and small pocket knives hijack a plane full of people? I'm glad to say that this movie added plausibility to that scenario for me. I find it astonishing that I have read reviews with people complaining about the cinematography, and other useless crap like that. Let's get for real, I think this movie was done with what was important..RESPECT! For the families of the victims. I think this movie would've been extremely disrespectful if there were a lot of special effects dumbing it down. That's typical Hollywood fashion anyway. To make money off of other people's tragedies. I must say that cinematography was the furthest thing from my mind while I was watching this movie, and if I wanted special effects or cinematography I could've watched "The Matrix" or "Lord of the Rings". This movie was way too serious to make light of. I'm also glad they didn't get a whole lot of big screen actors and actresses to portray these real life people, therefore, making it a whole lot more believable in my opinion. I find it hard to believe the validity of a real life events with Nicholas Cage, Maria Bello, and Michael Pena as the stars of the movie like "World Trade Center". That's portraying it like it's nothing more than another action/drama movie, or some kind of made for T.V movie. Now, I think that would've been done in poor taste, but this was tastefully done, and not offensive to anyone.</p></body></html>

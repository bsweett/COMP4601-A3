I knew this was going to be a rough film when I saw how graphic the first murder was. This is a fairy tale and a brutal war film rolled into one. I wasn't ready for the violence factor at all, but ultimately I was glad to see that this isn't some fluffy film about dreams coming true. While the dreams do come true, it is by death that they are realized. The special effects are amazing. The monsters were freaky, especially this one dude who has eyes in his hands. This film exceeds expectations in the fairy tale department and that part of the story is simply amazing. However, the "war" part of the story is just above par and while it is very good, it doesn't feel great because it is up against the fairy tale part of the movie that is just impossible to compete with. The acting is outstanding from the main characters to the bit parts. There were parts of this movie that did feel a little slow and I kept wishing they would get back to the monsters. But the movie on a whole really does capture your attention and imagination. It is different than anything I have ever seen. Not for kids... I repeat, NOT FOR KIDS! Go into this film expecting to shut your eyes from time to time if on screen violence and gore bothers you. I loved this movie, but I can only give it 4 stars because it felt unbalanced and slow at times. Otherwise, you really should see this movie and worth buying because it demands repeated viewings. Oh, you gotta see this!</p></body></html>

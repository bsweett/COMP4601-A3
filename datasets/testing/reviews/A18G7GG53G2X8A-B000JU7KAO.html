I give it credit for not being as preposterous as some of his other films, all of which have completely failed to impress me. He's a master manipulator when it comes to the way he advertises his films, using tried and true editing methods in the trailers to draw in an audience. Only when they actually see the film are they completely let down, being forced to watch half-hearted attempts at storytelling. Let's take a look back: "The Sixth Sense" was drawn out, moody, and implausible; "Unbreakable" ended before anything was resolved; "Signs" was just plain bad; and "The Village" wasn't much better, especially since it had one of the most unrealistic, unsatisfying, anticlimactic twist endings I've ever seen. With this kind of record, I didn't have much hope for this new film.<br /><br />And it seems I was justified. "Lady in the Water" tries so hard to be a modern fairy tale that it loses all sense of place or purpose. It tells the story of a mythical sea nymph--or narf--named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who emerges one night from the swimming pool of a Philadelphia apartment building. She meets Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the building's superintendent. He's a lost, tortured man, unable to speak without stuttering and still reeling over some traumatic past experiences. Even though he doesn't understand who she is or what her purpose is, he takes her in as casually as someone who takes in an abandoned kitten. I found this a little difficult to accept, considering she speaks to him in short, monotone, cryptic sentences. Basically, she's a mysterious person who continually eludes personal inquiries. Who would want someone like that to stick around? Apparently Heep does. But if he wants to get the whole story, he has to rely on someone else. This creates a problem: who on earth would know anything about narfs, especially since they're not supposed to be real?<br /><br />As fate would have it, there happens to be one tenant who knows all about them. She's an old Chinese woman (June Kyoto Lu) whose grandmother told her the legend many, many years ago. Apparently, there used to be a harmonious union between those that lived on the land and those that lived in the water, a place Story calls the Blue World. As time went on, humanity got more and more greedy, claiming pieces of land that stretched further and further away from the water. Eventually the union was broken. However, the narfs still make an attempt at reconciliation, every so often sending a daughter of specific importance into the human world to reestablish a connection.<br /><br />Here's where the bond between Story and Heep comes in; she's but one of the many narfs sent to restore the balance between humanity and the Blue World. Why have there been so many? Because all the ones before her have failed in their objectives, never again returning home. They were hunted down and destroyed by creatures called scrunts, evil dog- and plant-like beings hell bent on keeping narfs in our world. Exactly why is never explained, which I found troubling; in fairy tales, villains always have a reason for wanting to destroy the good characters (all you have to do is read stories by the Brothers Grimm, the "Harry Potter" novels, and the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy to see what I mean). For "Lady in the Water," Shyamalan created a villain just for the sake of creating a villain, never mind giving it any sense of meaning.<br /><br />But whatever the scrunt's beef with Story is, the fact remains that it's after her, and time is running out to get her home safely. Fortunately, the legend also tells of some important human beings who have the ability to protect her: there's a Guardian, a Healer, an Interpreter, and a Guild of Protectors. All of them are only chosen when the time is right. Since Story doesn't know who possesses the right qualities, it's up to Heep to interview specific apartment tenants. There are a number of possible candidates: the crossword puzzle-addict Mr. Dury (Jeffery Wright) and his son, Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey, whose character can look at a cereal box and find meaning); the jaded film critic Harry Farber (Bob Balaban); Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan) whose connection with Story centers on a book he's writing; his sister, Anna (Sarita Choudhury); Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung), daughter of the old Chinese woman; Reggie (Freddy Rodriguez), a young bodybuilder who, for whatever reason, is only toning the right side of his body; the morose Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin), whose tired of all the hatred and violence in the world; and the animal lover Mrs. Bell (Mary Beth Hurt). Topping off the list is a group of chain smoking slackers who live like slobs and like to party.<br /><br />As you can probably tell, each character has a particular quirk that in some form or another serves the story. In that regard, the film earns its billing as a bedtime story because, be it directly or indirectly, each character has a purpose. However, this creates a problem: Shyamalan's idea is a combination of fantastical elements and mundane, real world circumstances, neither of which come together in a way that's completely cohesive. Story tells Heep that her journey home can only be achieved by hitching a ride on a gigantic eagle, and in order for that to happen, the characters must come together and fulfill their destinies. How exactly does she expect such odd people to help her, especially since they supposedly live in the real world?<br /><br />I realize that this is a fairy tale and that I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief for a little while. But the story for "Lady in the Water" doesn't mesh with the fairy tale genre; despite the mythical creatures, it's actually too realistic, so rooted in the real world that the fantasy elements seem completely out of place. On top of all that, the film includes a fair number of humorous moments, all of which were incredibly inappropriate. I found myself asking "Why?" during much of the film. Why would a sea nymph choose to emerge from an urban swimming pool? Why not a lake, or perhaps even the ocean? Why do you have to look at a scrunt with a mirror? Why does everyone speak so cryptically? Why is it that an underwater dweller is able to breathe air and speak English?<br /><br />I think the most important question I had was this: why would everyone come to believe in Story so quickly? Immediately after she arrives, the events unfold as naturally as if it were an everyday occurrence. I didn't believe for a second that the reaction towards her was genuine, even for a fairy tale. There was no sense of wonder or bewilderment; there was only quiet acceptance and the vague assumption that all this was supposed to be happening. I guess this means we're supposed to assume the same thing, even though we don't know it. I don't think Shyamalan ever takes this into consideration when he's writing a movie, which is probably why I haven't liked anything he's made thus far. Yes, "Lady in the Water" is better than some of his other films, especially since it didn't trick the audience with a ridiculous plot twist. But it's still a ponderous, long-winded, and ultimately unsatisfying idea. As much as it may pain some of you, I can't quite recommend it; it's just not the way fairy tales were meant to be.</p></body></html>

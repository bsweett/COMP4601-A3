<meta name="summary" content="Good flick, although not true to life"></head><body><p>I was familiar with Krakauer from his previous book, Into Thin Air, about the ill-fated climb on Mt. Everest, so I was interested to see how a film based on this book would turn out. I haven't read the book, but I did enjoy the movie, and found it memorable in many ways, although some liberties were taken for artistic reasons.<br /><br />All the main players turned in superb performances, and Hal Holbrook (who I almost didn't recognize as I hadn't seen him on-screen in probably 25 years), was a joy to watch; he turns in possibly his greatest performance in a long, distinguished career as the aging preacher. He must be about 80 and looks pretty darn good for his age. He turns in a thoughtful but forceful performance as a man, who, although nearing the and of this life, has found the peace that Chris unsuccessfully seeks.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch is outstanding in the lead role as Chris, in which he's portrayed almost as a mythic adventurer of old setting out to test himself against the elements. He's charismatic and collects many friends and admirers along the way. Cris is convinced that he must purge the "evil within," why this is, isn't really explained, except that Chris had fallen under the influence of authors such as Thoreau, and others who had exhorted the importance of living apart from society in order to live the solitary life and reflect.<br /><br />The cinematography is also one of the film's great strengths. You'll enjoy the many stunning vistas of Alaska, which is still largely an unspoiled and unexploited land. Let's hope it stays that way.<br /><br />Overall the film is a dramatic and beautiful portrayal of a young man's quest for meaning, allthough it ultimately ended in tragedy, Despite some departures from the facts (Chris was not the charismatic character that was portrayed in the movie so much as a loner), it's still a fine film and one worth seeing for the other aesthetic qualities it brings to the screen.<br /><br />While we're on the subject, I wanted to make a few comments on another topic. I've read several Alaskan's comments who were very critical of Chris and what he tried to do, saying how foolish it was and how it showed little respect for the wilderness and the sort of skills and learning it takes to survive under those conditions, which can only be gleaned from many years of experience, and preferably under the tutelage of an experienced backwoodsman.<br /><br />That is no doubt true, and it's certainly true that Chris made some serious mistakes that an experienced backwoodsman wouldn't have made. For example, he failed to bring a map of the region that would have showed an area about 25 miles upstream where it spread out into some wide shallows, where the river could have safely been forded. There was also a hand tram only about a mile away from his camp that would have enabled him to escape. And he brought inadequate food and wasn't experienced enough in plant identification to live off the land, which led not only to starvation but poisioning when he misidentified a toxic plant that looked like a safe plant and that often grew right next to it.<br /><br />However, I would point out that those same people still buy their outdoor gear at REI, or some such, and have many modern conveniences that frontiersman or tribesman of old didn't have, which dramatically reduce the amount of labor and skill required and enhance their chances of survival. Not to mention the skillset of a late period Paleolithic hunter, who had to make his own spear tips and spears, bow and arrows, his own clothes, and virtually everything else in his toolkit himself. Even a modern woodsman's skills would pale by comparison to that.<br /><br />Recently I read a great biography of Daniel Boone and of his exploits in the new territories to the west. Of course, even he wasn't a Paleolithic hunter, but he was certainly one hell of a woodsman for his day. Equally impressive was the description of his wife. While Boone was off for several weeks wandering in a new area of the wilderness, leaving his young wife at home, she first proceeded to cut down the trees on their new plot of land. Then she built a small log cabin from the felled trees. Finally, she had their first field plowed and the crop sowed on the now cleared land by the time Boone got home. :-)<br /><br />Today, few people, even the vaunted backwoodsmen who criticized Chris, are the equivalent of a Daniel Boone, let alone a true Paleolithic hunter. While this doesn't excuse what Chris did, the perhaps sad truth is that hardly anyone living today has the skills of our ancestors that were honed over hundreds of thousands of years before they vanished in the wake of modern "civilization."</p></body></html>

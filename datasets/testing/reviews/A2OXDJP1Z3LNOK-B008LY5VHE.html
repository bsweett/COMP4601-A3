All of the inner workings - or malfunctions - of the shark are presented here.  <p>The movie itself is classic.  I remember being so scared of the water after seeing this movie.  The acting/directing here is superb, and the shark itself is terrifying.  Now, I know there are those that will say that the shark looks too fake or that it doesn't show up enough.  However, have you ever seen &quot;Deep Blue Sea?&quot;  Jaws is everything that &quot;sea&quot;  isn't.  The absence of the shark actually builds the suspense in the movie.  This movie is incredible and the extra features make this an incredible DVD purchase!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More than an Icon of American Film"></head><body><p>In Frank Capra's film imagination and ideal sentimental outlook of post WW2 America, Bedford Falls is the small town American dream. Looking back as a child this world was the "real" America or at least the way we all thought and felt it should be.<br /><br />I remember seeing this film at the young age of six or seven, in my pyjamas sprawled in front of the black and white TV set with my two younger sisters, though it was in the middle of July, before it became a "Christmas Tradition", the entire family sat attentive, watching George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) grow and become something of the true "good" man: sensitive, loving, caring and loyal.<br /><br />Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) is simply stunning and so innocent, beautiful and loved George with all her heart.<br /><br />George and Mary's wedding night is so Irish, small town, simple and lovely to watch as they come to terms with that broken-down "house" which had become a symbol of their respective dreams. Even as a small child, the old guy outside their window on their wedding night, singing lyrics of love felt to me to be true. We loved these two people because they were really in love and at bottom, we all want that love.<br /><br />Love becomes reality when the children arrive and making a living, a family, is important.<br /><br />George Bailey had always dreams of travelling the world. Even to the end, he kept old "tourist" pamphlets and books of far away places but something, people and basic life obligations always somehow prevented that dream.<br /><br />The villain of the film is Mr. Potter, (Lionel Barrymore) a Dickensian-like character, a true Capitalist without heart, pushed hard to turn Bedford Falls into a "Las Vegas", though it was little George Bailey, caring and deeply aware of the "worker" the "little man" who staved the ugly and evil Mr. Potter off from attaining his selfish goals.<br /><br />How this turn in the plot occurs, however, is pure fantasy, because as George Bailey stresses, having lost money ( by the stupidity of Uncle Billy) owed to the tyrant, is about to do a willing free-fall into the river, Clarence, an apprentice angel, prevents George from his self-destructive action, and talks Bailey into trying life again. The way the angel does this is true wisdom combined with loving magic.<br /><br />How would life be if you had never been born?<br /><br />Clarence the bumbling angel takes George through Bedford as though he never existed. George discovers that his life did have an affect on the town and the many lives he would have come in contact with. In a few words, without George, Bedford did indeed become a "Las Vegas" and his friends, particularly Mary, were lost.<br /><br />George comes back to reality and the entire community give back to George who has done so much for them, (the money Uncle Billy had lost) on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />A little bell rings which signifies an angel has moved up and finally attained their "wings". As an angel, Clarence, has turned a good man from self destruction, and now can move upward...and fly.<br /><br />This Frank Capra film written by Philip Van Doren Stern (story) and Francis Goodrich, et al., has somehow taught us that giving is one of the truest virtues of them all.<br /><br />A splendid film.</p></body></html>

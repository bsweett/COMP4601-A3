<meta name="summary" content="Actually A Good Movie..."></head><body><p>I was seriously skeptical about this film. I love "The Rock" but most video game flicks just don't turn out that great. Surprisingly, I think I liked this film as well as the AVP series and at least as well as "The Rock's" other films. It's not a masterpiece like "Predator" or "Alien" but it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />SOME CONTENT NOTES:<br />I've only seen the unrated version, so I can't comment on the theatrical. I can tell discerning viewers that the violence is pretty extreme (like the game, it involves chainsaws, giant guns and all kinds of impalement and dismemberment) the language is pretty heavy (though not pervasively so) and there is a scene of unneeded nudity involving one of the infected. I understand that the nude scene was not in the original "R" rated version... and I certainly don't think it was needed. It's pretty easy to fast forward, but still...<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />The unrated version is a lot longer than the theatrical, so there's gotta be a lot of extra content. I would get this version (keeping in mind the reservations noted above.) You'll be surprised at how decent and suspenseful it actually is!</p></body></html>

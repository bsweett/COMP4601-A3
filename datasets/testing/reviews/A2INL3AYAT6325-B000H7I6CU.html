<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable but not great film"></head><body><p>I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released.<br /><br />Not up to normal/past Pixar standards.<br /><br />I say it is most like A Bugs Life.  A good but not great film.<br /><br />Music did nothing for me.  Where was the normal stand out musical score?<br /><br />Standard extras, BUT no Making Of section.  I would have liked to have seen that.<br /><br />SOMETHING I HATE ABOUT SOME DVD PACKAGES.  THOSE HORRIBLE FLIP DOWN OPENERS.  YUCK!!!!!!<br /><br />Kids will enjoy.  Nascar fans will enjoy.<br /><br />Fun but forgettable after you watch it.</p></body></html>

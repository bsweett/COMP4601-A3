I don't know what was left out from the story, but I don't flipping care.  The same happened to Lord of the Rings (which I read), and people still loved it.  When will people learn that books and film are TWO different forms of story-telling media?  You can't put a concentrated, action-packed 3D story onto a two dimensional screen for ten hours straight.  People can barely sit through a ten-hour flight without getting ansy let alone a movie.<br /><br />The acting all around, including the kids of Dumbledore's Army, was superb.  The Luna Lovegood girl was excellent.  The interpretation of Delores Umbridge was delightfully scary to me, especially the way she disciplined her students.  How freakishly calm and distressingly evil she was in her bureacratic pink and prim, Stepford Nazi kind of way.  Give that lady an Oscar.  She was creepy.<br /><br />I hope to see Helena Bonham Carter again as Beatrix LeStrange.  She was scary crazy...and cool!<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe: He upped the ante.  Those trigger dream sequences and mental struggles were spot on, realistic and much better than what we saw in Goblet of Fire.  Good job!  Going on stage must have really helped.<br /><br />And who can discount the Wizard and Witches Battling--What incredible special effects!  I'll have to admit that does give Lord of the Rings a run for its money, and Lord of the Rings is a classic.  This movie is pretty intense emotionally and suspense wise.  It could classify as an action horror flick on its own.  It's sinster, sinister, sinister.  So Parents, it would be easy for me to say I'd be wary about bringing your little ones to this flick, but it's a Harry Potter film--which is a story about kids.  Go with them to watch it; there are some pretty intense and frightening scenes.<br /><br />Finally, hats off to director David Yates.  Excellent job and great editting.  At first I was not keen on the whole switching director thing, but it's really worked for the Potter series.  Potter endures a tremendous life change, and each director is able to bring out a particular significant vulnerability in Potter's life with each particular story.  Order needed an intense director for an intense storyline.  I wonder how Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows is going to turn out.<br /><br />[...]</p></body></html>

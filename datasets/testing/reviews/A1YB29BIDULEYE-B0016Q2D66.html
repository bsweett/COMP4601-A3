<meta name="summary" content="Interesting, But Seriously Flawed"></head><body><p>Well, if you really feel like depressing yourself, this movie will certainly deliver. It is an interesting movie, but serious flaws are prevalent.<br /><br />The movie starts with the Kate Winslet character (April) feeling humiliation after an unsuccessful play performance. She quickly has a bitter argument with her husband Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank). We see that their marriage is having trouble at best, and at worst is already dead and waiting for the tragic inevitable end. Whatever people may think of Frank, he has a point when he says: "It's not my fault that the play was lousy."<br /><br />A flaw here is that April and Frank are both unhappy with their lives. And while April looks for an irrational escape, Frank seems more set in reality that they have 2 children as well as responsibilities. True, Frank is not happy at his job. But he's not going to 'jump ship' when he has a wife and 2 children. (One pun on "The Titanic" here is inevitable.)<br /><br />Later, April gets a strange idea to run away to France. What she says may sound good in THEORY. But how can she be sure of getting a job? Frank again carries reason when he says: "It might make more sense if I were a writer or painter."<br /><br />It is worth noting that while the movie doesn't mention it, April may very well be bipolar. The movie tries to keep sympathy balanced between the characters, but it just doesn't work. Towards the latter half, April finds that she is pregnant. And Frank knows that he has to go back to reality and accept a great promotion he has been offered.<br /><br />Whether you are anti abortion or pro choice, there is an unavoidable sting of reality when Frank says: "A sane woman doesn't perform an abortion on herself so she can live out some fantasy." April responds that it is for him. And Frank understandably responds: "How can it be for me when the mere thought of it makes my stomach sick?!"<br /><br />Frank desperately tries to save the shambled remains of their marriage, but April only gets more cruel: "I never loved you. You're just a man who made me laugh at a party." At this point, we can scarcely blame Frank for his rage here: "Then why are you living in my house? Why are you my wife?" Also to his credit, despite his rage, he is able to avoid physically striking her.<br /><br />Another serious flaw in this movie is that they try to make a cruel and nasty man carry weight. (What he says is not fit to be printed here and would probably not be allowed here.) Charles Dickens often put the voice of reason into eccentrics, but without the profanity and cruelty.<br /><br />I'm not saying the movie does not have some worthwhile moments. But the story just doesn't work. While it tries to make April heroic, it just does not work. And it seems to try to make Frank look bad for keeping one foot in reality.<br /><br />Sorry; usually lightening just won't strike twice.</p></body></html>

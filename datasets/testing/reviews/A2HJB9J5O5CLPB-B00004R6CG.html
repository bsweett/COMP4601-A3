I've seen it on the big screen where it's unbelievable, Freudian theme, magnificent color, and the filmed record of San Francisco of 1959 are as eerie as the script of murder and obsessive love. I'm very fond of Kim Novak and I realize big 1950's blondes aren't everyone's turn on, but in this film, with all her wide skirts and painted eyebrows, she does it for me. Hitchcock did scores of interesting shots that added mood to this film. Stewart and Novak realize they are in love and kiss passionately at a rocky California beach. The ocean crashes on a big boulder and sprays behind their heads. Perfect timing or fifty takes, I don't know. After careful thought, the script seems implausible. A man in love knows what the woman of his dreams looks like and certainly would know that the shop girl, though in different hair color and clothes is his love. The story line portrays a straight murder mystery, but after a number of viewings I realize how complicated and layered the individual motivations and neurosis that Stewart and Novak suggest with brilliant subtle underscore. The murder itself makes no sense either. How did the husband and Novak hide and get away from the horrified onlookers and police? The truth is, the fantasy is so compelling, nobody cares. Great art is a suspension of disbelief. Vertigo is great, great art.</p></body></html>

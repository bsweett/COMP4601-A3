Paul Giamatti was a shoe in for oscar gold and deserved that oscar more than any other actor last year (I think that Foxx was a little too over-rated)...regardless though this film was just brilliant, touching and funny and just real all the way around.  Thomas Haden Church was great as was Maddison and Oh, but nobody can touch Giamatti's drive in this film.  I loved his charactor every minute he was on screen.  The film is simple, plot wise that is, but the meaning it carries about love and life and friendship and relationships and starting over and or moving on from the things and experiences that weigh you down is endlessly moving.  Great great movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="PIERCE BROSNAN AT HIS BEST"></head><body><p>THE MATADOR is a nicely twisted take on mid-life crisis movies, but it's also a showcase for Pierce Brosnan ( still my favorite 'Bond' ). He plays a hitman that wouldn't know a scruple if he stepped on it, but in his own smarmy-creepy way remains a bit likeable despite his many faults. One day he wakes up in donkey-doo ( literally ), after failing to 'hit' the person he was assigned to kill. He meets a businessman whose own comfortable little life is unraveling. They become uncomfortable 'friends' over drinks, and the story begins to take some, strange, often darkly funny, and somewhat appalling turns. Greg Kinnear is humorous, and convincing in his role as Brosnan's very stiff, new buddy, But Brosnan is sensational. It's well worth a look- or two.</p></body></html>

What happened in Uganda didn't need embellishing for mass consumption.  That said, the film was well done and Whitaker earned his accolades fairly.  McAvoy was great in it, as well.  The writing was not terrific by any stretch, and either the direction or editing caused the plot to fall apart about a third of the way in.  I'm not sure which it was, but after a wonderful carefully paced setup, events encapsulated and started to be so disjunct that they seemed out of character.  I stuck through the latter half of it mostly to stay with Whitaker's performance.</p></body></html>

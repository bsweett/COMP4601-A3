<meta name="summary" content="Adaptation weakened by overemphasis on visual effects"></head><body><p>This was a great story as a novel.  It could have translated well to the screen, but the producers spend so much time showering us with fantastic visual effects that they really take away from what should be the real focus of the story:  the dead girl's observations and the aftereffects of her murder on her family.<br /><br />There is also short shrift given to the girl's mother and little brother; it's the father and the sister that get more screen time and attention.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci is perfectly creepy as the neighbor who is the guilty party (I am not spoiling anything--this is revealed early in the film because it is not a murder mystery for the viewer to solve).<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan is terrific as Susie Salmon.</p></body></html>

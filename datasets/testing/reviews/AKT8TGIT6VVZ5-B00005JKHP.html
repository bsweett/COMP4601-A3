<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Star Trek Film Transformed Into Classic SF Cinema"></head><body><p>I salute Robert Wise for having the courage and determination to transform &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; into one of the finest science fiction films made in the latter half of the 20th Century. More than any of the subsequent films in the series, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; has an epic, grand quality to it. Furthermore, it is the only film which truly pays homage to Gene Roddenberry's optimistic vision of humanity's future. Wise does a a splendid job editing the film so the pace is quickened; yet it does suffer slightly from some of the wooden dialogue said by the likes of Kirk, Spock and McCoy. However, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley do a fine job portraying these three principal characters. Yet I must also commend both Nichelle Nichols and James Doohan for their acting. Both Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta are excellent respectively as Captain Decker and Lieutenant Ilia. The special effects are a vast improvement over both the original theatrical and television releases; they strongly emphasize the alien nature of V'Ger and its immense cloud of energy. Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score is now the soundtrack to a splendid film.<p>Other director's cuts have had theatrical releases too. I earnestly hope Paramount Pictures shall follow suit and release &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; soon. As much as I enjoyed watching the DVD, I realized that this a film which ought to be seen in film theaters across the globe. &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; should now be regarded as one of Robert Wise's finest cinematic achievements.</p></body></html>

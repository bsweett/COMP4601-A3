<meta name="summary" content="A Shadow in The Fog..."></head><body><p>This movie takes the view of there have been two killers in the infamous Jack The Ripper slaying at White Chapel. One being the henchman of a respected doctor who is also a part of the ruling Masonic Lodge of the day who recognizes that there are certain forces inherant in certain symbols, such as The Pentagram {a victims with which he configured in its symmetry, positioning several relics and remnants of the victim therein.}<p>It is eventually divulged that all of the slayings were committed for purposes according to his particular and peculiar purposes. He believed himself to be the incarnation of iconoclastic forces that would bring the 20th century into fruition; but even his Masonic brothers viewed his views as too extreme and ended up condemning him to a lobotomy - the preferred method of treating the perceived mentally-ill. <p>We are introduced to several prostitutes of the day; filthy, dirty, crass, diseased, and minimalistic in hygiene practices as well as teeth. However, it was a bit sad and disheartening to witness how these women of pulchritude were treated, considering they do provide a popular service to the citizens of London. Yet these are the types of blindlight-rooted cultures which produce the most mindlessly habitually hate-filled hypocrites in such societies.<p>Grapes play a role in the slayings, as each sacrifice was given a single vine of exquisite grapes to consume, along with a vial of some liquor, both of which each woman consumed in tandem with ravenous delight. And that was their final indulgence. They were forthwith dispatched and their disemboweled innards left artfully positioned around the corpses, which would subsequently manifest a theory in which the killer may have been an artist. But this film focuses on the surgeon analogy, with the chief investigator {played by Johnny Depp} ironically quite schooled in the forensic arts, who himself demonstrates his peculiarities such as indulging in the Green Demoness Absinthe, which he meticulously mixes with an amount of six drops of laudanum, a well-known poison, to form an amazing intoxicant alight with the blue flame to fully integrate the ingredients to this forbidden elixir, concocted like an expert Alchemist. He dwells in blissful rapport there in his tub, luxuriously partaking in this "Alchemist's Delight". <p>The Phantom of White Chapel strikes again and again, the gleam of his cold blade shimmering in the moonlight, tainted red by crimson life. The figure in black with his top hat and silver-tipped cane disappears into the fog, and the mystery continues.<p>The film derives its nomenclature from a brief letter mailed to the Police station accompanied by a sliver of the woman's kidney, the other half which he happily consumed, and mentioned that it was "very nice." Signed, "From Hell". <p>Understandable, considering it had been filled with a choice blend of the liquor and grapes, stewed in its own juices. So it was revealed that the killer was also a cannibal. Strains of Hannibal Lechter as well as The Zodiac Killer are influenced here.<p>Another interesting occurrence transpired when someone had left a now infamous message on the wall at one of the bloody scenes:<p>"The jewes {sic} are not the ones that will be blamed for nothing."<p>So it was both divulged that the perpetrator was a somewhat literate man, and not some savage or Gypsy as was alleged thus far. But this incident also may lead the viewer to consider that message may have been an attempt to redirect attention away from the correct path of inquiry, as well as establish a good bit of aggravation towards the many-times convenient scapegoats that have been Jews. This introduced a religious as well as an aesthetic connotation to divert attention away from the Masons, who were the underground ruling class portrayed by the film; the social elite whose cult was alleged to run England at the time, with its esteemed members merely going through the motions with The Church of England; the politics of enacting mass behavior on the surface in order to maintain positions of leadership while preserving true to one's roots in private.<br />By and by, the clues manifest themselves until eventually, the investigator is face to face with an esteemed doctor he admires, whose delusions of grandeur drove him into the halls of infamy.<p>Overall, a dark production arranged in a cinematic style reminiscent of Coppola, yet not as perfectly hewn. "From Hell" is yet another subnote in the legendary of a socio-psychopathic "madman" whom some would hail as a genius.</p></body></html>

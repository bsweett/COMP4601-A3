<meta name="summary" content="I was very impressed by this film.........................."></head><body><p>First off, for anyone thinking about getting this movie, go do it!! No matter what anyone has told you already about the film. I notice a lot of people writing that they didn't like Garden State and that's fine, I personally thought it was great. To me it was real life on film, and within that real life there are very different people. Unfortunately not everyone wants to see movies that remind them of reality, and I guess not everybody reality is the same as mine.<br /><br />After seeing this movie last night, it kept replaying in my mind for some reason. It reminded me of the movie "The Graduate" (no slight praise) for many reasons, not the least of which was the soundtrack which included a song by Simon and Garfunkel. I mean, why include an old song by S&G in the middle of a host of contemporary artists - it must have been done on purpose - right? And the pool scene, although different than Hoffman's, still serves to illustrate Andrew Largeman's alienation.<br /><br />Much like the " The Graduate," it was the little things that got to me. The escalators heading in two directions at the end, the making of a completely original dance, the touching of the father, the arc on the edge of the abyss, the silent Velcro...I could go on.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is a great actress and  I enjoy watching her on this films and others that she previously done. Playing the role of a goofy, epileptic but cute, hometown girl, she steals the show. She hits all the right notes. She is responsible for the death by tread-wheel of a loved one, she habitually lies, and she's slightly crazy, but Andrew and we can't help falling in love with her.<br /><br />Even so "Garden State" is well worth watching, if only to remind us that the comatose state most of us live in is only temporary, and the joy of a life well lived is forever. Movies like this are either rare or one of kind. I hope Braff (star, writer, and director) has a few more like this in him.</p></body></html>

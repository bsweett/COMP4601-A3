<meta name="summary" content="Thanks, Max. I needed a good laugh."></head><body><p>I was a fan of Don Adam's portrayal of Maxwell Smart in the original series, a show that was funny and silly, but also biting and clever far ahead of it's time. One of our daughters saw the new film and said she laughed her head off the whole way through. The Mrs. and I agreed we should check it out. We were not disappointed.<br /><br />Steve Carrell does not try an impersonation of Don Adams, but the writers and performers do a great job of staying true to the spirit of the original while updating it in a way that our daughters, who wouldn't know Don Adams from John Quincy Adams, LIKED it.<br /><br />We liked it too. All of the "great bits" from the old series are weaved in, at least momentarily, and sometimes I was laughing at the subtle homage. But at other times the filmmakers wisely decided to put Steve Carrell in a room and turn him loose. He has a scene in an airplane lavatory with a "special" Swiss Army knife that MUST be seen, although the Mrs. recommends you not have a full bladder when you do. Another scene involving one of those movie laser security systems and a rodent had me howling. My brother and I are big fans of "Chuck Norris Jokes/Facts", and I had to call him immediately after the film to tell him he HAD to see it (after our mutual disappointment at the new Indiana Jones.)<br /><br />The plot is a skeleton on which to hang the multiple hilarious bits, but it works fairly well as a spy movie. Some of the Bond or Flint movies had plots twice as idiotic, and they weren't supposed to be comedies.<br /><br />Carrell is ably supported by Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. She has several great moments - flashing her long legs on a dance floor and saving Max from certain death in a mid-air rescue involving a parachute and a kiss.<br />Alan Arkin brings the perfect pitch to this tale as the Chief, with one foot squarely planted in the "serious spy world" of government, and the other foot ready to observe Smart's silliness.<br /><br />I was ready to laugh at a movie and this one delivered. The last time I laughed that hard in a theater was at "Anchorman".<br /><br />For fans of the old show, or simply someone who could use a good laugh.</p></body></html>

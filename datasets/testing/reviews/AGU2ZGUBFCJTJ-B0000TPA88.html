<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - 'League' Not Quite 'Extraordinary'"></head><body><p>Theatrical adaptations of famous comic books are becoming the new trend these days in Hollywood. The major studios are digging out every comic book superhero imaginable even the lesser known ones and so far the films have been successful. So it isn?t surprising that 20th Century is stepping up to the plate for the third time this year. Daredevil was a moderate success garnering $100 million against a $75 million budget and X2: X-Men United kicked off the summer season with a bang gathering $210 million against a $100 million budget. Fox is hoping that The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be just as successful but it will be a hard sell. The League is a much lesser known comic book mini-series then big profiles superheroes like Spider-Man or X-Men, so there won?t be as big of a fan base to rely on. Another problem is the now blatant fact that not all comic-book adaptations take with movie-goers. Though The Hulk?s opening weekend became the highest grossing opening weekend ever for the month of June, the film itself was received poorly by both the critics and the general public and experienced a nearly seventy percent drop in its second weekend. Rumors of fights breaking out between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington helped generate bad buzz for the film. and the lackluster advertising campaign for the film have not helped in the studio?s efforts to create substantial buzz going for this feature.<br /><br />The story centers on the formation of a team of extraordinary individuals that must fight an evil man who has plans for the world. During the year 1899, an evil individual by the name of The Fanthom has gone around the world capturing scientists and causes major catastrophes in order to have the European countries blame each other. This, he hopes, will cause the countries to create a world war and with his advanced military weapons, the European countries will have to buy from him creating a huge profit for himself. The British Empire, determined to avert a world war, calls upon a man named ?M? to assemble The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Allan Quartermain, the hero of such tales as King Solomon?s Mines, is chosen to lead the team. Other members of the team include Rodney Skinner (The Invisible Man), Mina Harker (Vampire), Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll, and Dorian Grey, each of which holds a special ability unique to the team. Joining along for the ride is Agent Sawyer (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) from the United States. Each individual seems to have a hidden secret and don?t get along with each other but they must put their scrabbles aside in order to save the world from the brink of war. The story for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen gets off to a good start and ends fairly well but sequences in between seem to drag the entire picture down, making it the entire experience seem worse then it actually was. The dialogue stays on the serious side which works for it but when it begins to slip into a more comical form, the quality of the picture is lost. Those not familiar with the famous literary characters involved in the film may be confused with the lack of background information given on many of them but perhaps that just means you need to bone up on your reading skills.<br /><br />If you looking for extraordinary acting and premium star power, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is definitely not your film, but most people, those with a brain, will know that going into this film. Sean Connery lights up the screen in the role of Allan Quartermain and feels appropriately cast as a man who continues to do the job he has been doing for many years despite his increasing age. There were consistent rumors from the set that Connery and director Norrington were at each other?s necks throughout the shoot but there is no evidence to say those fights affected his performance from what is shown in the film. Tony Curran, who plays the role of The Invisible Man, does as best of a job as he can but this character has its share of problems. The Invisible Man seems to be nothing more then a comedic special effects diversion and seems to just plain disappear (no pun intended) for a good portion of the movie with no explanation as to why he left or how he came to a particular place. Jason Flemying does his best with the role of Dr. Jekyll, which is pretty good for the most part, but his character is also a special effect diversion when he becomes Mr. Hyde. Shane West is great as Agent Sawyer, though the film could have done a better job explaining how this care free boy from Mississippi came to be in the secret service but that is a minor squabble. Peta Wilson, who is best known from La Femme Nikita fame, does what she can with the role of Mina Harker but there are too many questions and not enough answers, a constant theme in this film. What is the deal with her and Dorian Grey? And speaking of Dorian Grey, Stuart Townsend is horribly miscast in this role and the character itself is predictable and uninteresting.<br /><br />Overall, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen make come as a disappointment to the average moviegoer, one who isn?t a comic-book fanatic or literary wizard, but even for those select few who are this film may still be a little tough to swallow. Specific background information on many of the film?s primary characters is missing which leaves most of the audience struggling to figure out where they are coming from and how that helps play out the film?s ending. The League?s special effects are difficult to put on a scale based on the films offered thus far this year; on the one hand, they lack the superior quality present in Pirates of the Caribbean but on the other hand, they aren?t clunky as was present in The Hulk. What is certain is the scenes containing the repulsive Nautilus, Captain Nemo?s submarine, are the worst examples of computer animation presented this summer. The action sequences are the sufficient enough to keep the attention of movie-goers looking for some different for one night as opposed to seeing Pirates once again. It may not be fantastic, it may not even be mediocre to some, but it?s worth the price of admission ? for a matinee at least.</p></body></html>

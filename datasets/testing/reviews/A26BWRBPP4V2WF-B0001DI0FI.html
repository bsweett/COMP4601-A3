The Royal Navy had such a tradition by 1805 (the year of this film) that its ships really were little floating islands of England.  This is both good and bad - it made them formidible opponents, was morale-boosting for the crew, etc.  Of course, it also embodied the imperialistic chauvenism of the English, as well as their stratified society.  These thoughts went through my head after watching "Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World" because the film so convincingly models the attitudes and feel of a 19th-century man-of-war.<br /><br />I have not read the source material - the Maturin-Aubrey series by Patrick O'Brien - so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film to the books.  However, as director Peter Weir points out, the plots aren't nearly so important as the relationships between the boat and its crew, between the crew-members themselves, and the books' historical authority on the Age of Sail.  Thus, this doubly-named film ("Master and Commander" and "The Far Side of the World" are, in fact, two different stories) concentrates on the accuracy of costumes, rigging, and speech.  This accuracy is essential, as immerses the viewer into the film, so when the action does take place, it is all the more poignant.  The basic plot - Capt. Aubrey hunting a larger and better armed French ship around the Cape - allows for some spectacular footage.  There are the obligatory sea battles and a visit to the Gallopagoes (filmed on location in the very islands), but the best part of the film is probably the storm as the ship rounds the Cape of Good Hope.  Combining location footage, computer animation, and model work (both full and 1/6 scale), the storm is hang-on-to-your armrests convincing.  This brings up the point of the effects; they are so seamless that they are unnoticeable, and this is possibly the film with the best-ever visual effects.<br /><br />So why only 4/5 stars?  Viewing this film on my system, it does move a little slow.  It works better in a movie theatre, I think, but since this is a review of the DVD, I have to deduct a star for the DVD-watching experience.  The extras on this two-disc set are interesting, but not complete.  There is ample footage of the film being made - including a 20-minute feature on the fantastic score and some deleted scenes - but there are no background featurettes on historical context, little on the anatomy/vocabulary of a square-rigged frigate, etc.  I think most people who would buy this DVD set would also be interested in this information, and not so much in information that is so similar to the extras on the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings special-edition DVD's.</p></body></html>

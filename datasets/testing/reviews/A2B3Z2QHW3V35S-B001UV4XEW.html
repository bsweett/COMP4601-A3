<meta name="summary" content="funny movie"></head><body><p>Before I got the change to watch this movie I heard from a lot of people that it was the funnies movie. Once I got the chance to watch it I thought it was stupid. Husband wanted this movie. So we bought it. I watched it yesterday and I found it funny. I think when I first saw it I didn't expect it to be stupid funny and that is why I didn't like it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the REmake of what movie?"></head><body><p>OK THIS IS THE STUPIDEST REMAKE I HAVE EVER SEEN.<br />WHERE IS THE COOK,FRANK,CRAZY BROTHER/HITCH HIKER,OR EVER THE PLOT.. THE LEFT SO MUCH OUT OF THE REFAKE,IT IS LIKE WATCHING A FAILED SEQUEL.THE MOVIE DOESNT EVEN SHOW AND &quot;MEAT&quot; EATING WITCH IS THE POINT OF THE KIDS GETTING KILLED.AND THE GRAVE ROBBINGS WHERE ARE THEY AT? THE ENDING TO THIS ONE SUCKED ALSO!<br />IF YOU WATCH PART 2 AFTER YOU WATCH THE REMAKE IT MAKES NO CENS,BUT IF YOU WATCH PART 2 WITH THE REAL TCM,THEN IT MAKES CENS...IN THIS ONE THEY ADDED SOME NEW/DUMB IDEAS TOO LIKE,HAVING THE TEENS TO BE POT HEADS,A HITCH HIKER SUICIDE,<br />A LITTLE KID (A.K.A. A LITTLE BROTHER) A &quot;CRAZY COP&quot;,KIDNAPPING WOMEN,AND THE MADE LETHERFACE REALLY SMART IN THIS ONE,NO TALK ABOUT CANNIBALISM AT ALL AND THIS REFAKE SUCKS!</p></body></html>

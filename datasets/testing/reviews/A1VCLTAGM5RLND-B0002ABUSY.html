Granted I wasn't a huge fan of the fast moving zombies, but I suppose I can let that go because truthfully, maybe before rigor mortis sets in, you'd be able to move quickly, who knows? I do know that I was on the edge of my seat through many parts of this movie. The characters were stuck in a mail.

<meta name="summary" content="The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"></head><body><p>On August 1973, in Texas, Erin, her boy-friend Kemper, their friends Andy and Morgan and the hitchhiker Pepper are returning from a vacation in Mexico having been to a Lynnard Skynnard concert. Kemper is driving when a disturbed young woman dangerously wanders onto the road. They decide to help her, and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle. They decide to look for a telephone to call the Sheriff, and they end in the house of Thomas Hewitt, where their lives are threatened by the sick Leatherface and his deranged family. This is a very good horror movie. Well-filmed, well-acted, suspensful, with good characters. While not a classic, this remake is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

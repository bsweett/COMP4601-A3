Using the Brothers Grimm tale about the princess with the skin as fair as snow who is taken in by a group of seven dwarfs, Walt Disney fleshed out the characterization of most of the main players while also watering down some of the more graphic and disturbing elements of the story.  The movie had been in production for years and Disney gambled his entire future on the project.  However, the development took so long and the picture cost so much money that before its release it was known around Hollywood as "Disney's Folly".  But, Disney put the critics to rest and the film would become not only one of the most beloved animated films, but one of the most popular films of all time.  The success of the picture paved the way for Disney to expand his company from a small in-house production company that created mostly shorts to a major Hollywood studio.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is rather straight-forward.  Princess Snow White's stepmother is a wicked and evil queen and the most beautiful woman in her kingdom.  She knows because she asks her Magic Mirror every day.  Then one day the Mirror reveals that her stepdaughter, Snow White is more beautiful than she.  The Queen is furious and orders a woodsman to take the girl into the woods to kill her.  He takes her into the woods, but cannot deliver the blow and tells Snow White to run. Snow White runs away and stumbles upon the cottage of seven dwarfs.  She becomes a kind of adopted mother for the little men and they shower their affection upon her. However, the Queen learns what has happened and sets out to put Snow White into a deathly sleep that only can be broken by true love's first kiss.<br /><br />Even though the movie is over 70 years-old, it's still gorgeous.  Audiences nowadays have become accustomed to the slick, chic, and sleek animation of CGI.  Those style of films are enjoyable to watch, but there is an eloquence and a personality of the old hand-style of animation that is lost when a film is done through CGI.  Since it was the first of its kind, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is one of the best examples of classic animation to watch.  For example, watch the scene where Snow White is getting water from a well and the camera shows us what it looks like from viewing up the well, through the water, ripples and all. It's a difficult scene that looks gorgeous and it was all drawn by hand. Simply magnificent.<br /><br />The Diamond Edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is basically the Blu-Ray edition of the movie with a DVD thrown in to try to lure people who don't really want Blu-Ray into getting Blu-Ray. The DVD only features an audio commentary, a music video with Tiffany Thornton, a sneak peak at the upcoming THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, and a series of trailers for Disney DVDs.  Meanwhile the Blu-Ray discs are loaded with all kinds of features, but since I'm still not going to jump on the Blu-Ray wagon, I can't watch any of those.<br /><br />Overall, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a must own movie for any Disney fan, film student, or person who enjoys animated movies. If you don't already own the movie on DVD, the Diamond Edition of the movie is worth getting because Disney will be putting the movie back into the vault and it won't be available again for years.</p></body></html>

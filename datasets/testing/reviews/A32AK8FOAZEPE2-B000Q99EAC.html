<meta name="summary" content="wonderful!"></head><body><p>this is the best movie i've viewed so far between 2006 and 2007! Sylvester Stallone has again proved himself to be one of the most talented actors and screenwriters. lot of people treated him as a joke as the old rocky balboa, even called him names, steroid junkie and other things. but even they're partly true, with his continued contribution to the movie culture, rockys and first blood/rambo series, he indeed has brought lot of good memories to our lives. sylvester stallone would always be a spiritual figure to me with respect, no matter what.<br /><br />as to this wonderful movie, every and all the ingredients are so good, screenplay, script, dialog, acting, supporting cast, editing and, furthermore, the subtle feather-like sound track as the background music is also one of the best sound tracks i've experienced so far.<br /><br />a wonderful movie to be treasured time and again.<br /><br />thank you, mr. stallone and to rocky balboa also, a larger-than-life but always down-to-earth true hero, a role model ever better created on the screen by stallone for those young men who really want to do some good for their lives.</p></body></html>

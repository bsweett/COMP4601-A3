<meta name="summary" content="Overall.....A good message portrayed on screen"></head><body><p>At first I was pretty hesitate to see this movie because I thought it was just going to be about a bunch of stoned junkies trying to kick their habits. Surprisingly, its much more than that and I appreciate the message delivered in this film. Harry Played by (Jared Leto) lives with his mom Sara (Ellen Burstyn). Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)and his friend Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) are tied up with the drug business, there unfortunate habits eventually catch up to them they seem to let go of reality. Meanwhile Harry's mom is also caught up with the popular use of Diet pills. His mother is A Televison Junkie who is lonely and wants to get on "Tappy Tibbons Show" which is a similar to a Richard Simmons program played by Christopher Mcdonald. Just like Harry, His mother fantasizes, she wants to lose weight and fit in that red dress so she can be famous. I won't give away the ending, but it isn't pretty. then again most movies about raging drug addicts aren't pretty, hence, the movie Transpotting. What did attract me to this movie is the message. What the director was trying to portray is that almost every thing has the potential to qualify as a "Drug." For example, Harry's mom is addicted to television and can't seem to get a grip on herself, Harry and Tyrone can't seem to stop living life on the edge ect. You get the point. Overall the acting is stunning as well, the whole cast especially Ellen Burstyn give outstanding performances. As for the dvd, fans of this movie won't be dissapointed either. For one thing we get the director's cut of the film, with some good interiews with the writer and cast. A good solid commentary and some interesting deleted scenes. On The documentary we get a good behind the scenes on the story and setting on Coney Island. As for quality, the director obviously, intended to use a dark grainy transfer to set the mood of the movie, which he does a great job here as well. Don't let this movie pass you by reading the back cover because its not your typical junkie movie...............</p></body></html>

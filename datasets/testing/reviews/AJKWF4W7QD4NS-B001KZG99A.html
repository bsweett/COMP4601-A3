<meta name="summary" content="The best film to come from Marvel in quite some time"></head><body><p>Being Marvel Studios' first self-financed film, Iron Man is a pure treat from start to finish.  I won't bother going into the storyline, since most already know it by now considering how smashing a success the film proved to be at the box-office, but it does go without saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel film to see the light of day, outshined only by X2: X-Men United.  Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as billionaire industrialist and weapons developer Tony Stark, and Jon Favreau is definitely the right man for the job in helming the film.  It's perfectly paced and pays wonderous homages to the classic comics that it's adapted from, all the while featuring an ending that have you simply salivating for what's to come not only in the realm of Iron Man, but of Marvel as a whole.  As a superhero film, Iron Man is definitely close to the top (but nowhere near The Dark Knight, which takes the notion of the superhero movie and turns it on it's head), with the only drawback for me personally being that I just couldn't get into Terrence Howard as James Rhodes.  I don't know what it is, I jsut don't find him all that well-casted as Rhodes as I do everyone else in the film.  Still though, Iron Man is a pure blast for nearly it's entire running time, and here's hoping that Favreau, Downey, and co. can keep the magic coming.</p></body></html>

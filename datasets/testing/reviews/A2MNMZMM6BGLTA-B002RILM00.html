<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Should Be Sacrificed and BURNED!"></head><body><p>I had and have heard so much thru the years about The Wicker Man (the origional). I had heard that it was a cult classic and a forgotten gem. Well, I never saw all of the origional Wicker Man but some bozo put the entire end on Youtube so I got the basic premise of it. BUT I did just see the entire version that stars Nicolas Cage. I must say that I only saw about 15 minutes of the origional and it was better and had more depth than this dreck. The movie starts our ok but then just turns to blah. They leave out one of the things that made the origional good (or at least good to some people) that is the fact that the cop is a devout Christian that sets him off against this bunch of pagan fanatics. In this remake Cage is just a cop who experiences a tragic and traumatic event and then starts taking medication because he is so disturbed by what happened. They also change up the pagan weirdo's. They are still weird but they are kind of a man hating cult of freako bizarro strango people. They use men for labor and for 'breeding'. But anyway, this movie just isn't very good and Nicolas Cage proves again that he is not a very good actor and has little range beyond his usual quicky stuff.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor watch the Youtube clip if you are intriqued by hearing about this movie because the remake is not very good and from what I have heard and seen of the origional it's not very good either, weird and different but not good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Death touches Life"></head><body><p>I haven't read the book so this critique is based on knowledge of the movie, itself.  Generally speaking, however, it's difficult for a movie to 'live up' to the book on which it was based because 1.  movie scenes are usually more limited than 'scenes' in a book and 2.  books rely on imagination far more than do movies.<br /><br />With these limitations in mind, I quite enjoyed this surreal and touching movie.  No, it isn't perfect and the story--perhaps necessarily--isn't linear and logical but addresses an extremely painful topic--the serial murder of lovely young people--in as delicate and moving way as may be possible.<br /><br />I would have given this film a full 5 stars but thought the ending was unnecessarily weak.  Yes, the killer's own death is foreordained in previous scenes but I, at least, would have preferred the satisfaction of vengeful temporal justice.</p></body></html>

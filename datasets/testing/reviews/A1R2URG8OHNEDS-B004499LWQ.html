It's based on a stage play, and it's obvious because this movie works like a play, giving conversation after conversation rotating between these characters. It always grabs your attention, and it always gives you something to think about. I recently wrote about "The Machinist," which is a character study of Trevor Reznick. "Closer" has four great characters to study, and they all deserve each other. It is about the ability of being happy, telling the truth, and to love, because I don't think any of these characters are able to do any of those. Jude Law is in this movie, to add to the other five that he's in, but his preformance is not the highlight. There are four great preformances, equally from Jude, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen, who probably was the most nasty out of all of them. You will be shocked by some of the phrases and words you hear in the film, but it's exactly the things that we say in real life. It's just more personal because you don't realize it when you say it. The movies don't normally give you such a breath of reality, but this does. It's directed by Mike Nicols, and I've only seen one of his movies, "The Birdcage." This is a totally different kind of movie, but it does mix elements of dram and humor, even though it's not as slapstick as "The Birdcage."<br /><br />The movie begins with Dan and Alice walking towards each other, flirting with their eyes, when she's isn't paying attention and gets hit by a car. Dan volenteers to take her to the hospital and tend  for her bloody knee and side of her face, and they get to conversation. They walk to his office, and then we cut to years later. Dan wrote a book about Alice, and is getting his picture taken for the book jacket. The photographer is Anna, and soon the two begin to kiss, when Dan tells her that Alice is going to pick him up, while still kissing her. He tells her that he's in love with her, and has to see her again, but she tells him that he will forget about her. He decides to have fun, and goes to an adult internet chat room, where he poses as a women as he talks to Larry. While Dan is just having fun, Larry is actually taking care of his sexual desires, and when Dan says "I want to meet you," he tells him to meet "her" at the aquarium. Dan isn't really going to go, he's just busting Larry's chops. Larry meets Anna at the aquarium, thinking that she was the one on the internet, and eventually the two start their relationship. Pretty soon, Dan's affair with Anna leads Alice to become a stripper, where her and Larry meet and have their fun, as Dan, Alice, Larry, and Anna all form a web of deciet, hurt, and overall, what they believe to be love.<br /><br />Towards the end of "Closer," Dan makes a comment saying that with the truth we'd all be animals. The irony here is that none of the characters ever tell the truth to the ones they say they love. It begins to make you wonder if any of them have the power to love, because everytime they get closer to commitment, they "fall in love" with somebody else. These people can all be happy if they wanted to be, but they don't. They just want to be happy during the moment they are in, and nothing more. It's very powerful, and very sad. There is some dark humor, a joke here or there, and everything works in the movie. It's getting to be that I go see a movie and expect Jude Law to be there. I've seen five of his six movies, and I think there has to be an Oscar nomination in one of them for him. I'm aiming towards this, but he was also the main focus in "Alfie," which was an "ok" movie with a breathtaking preformance. Julia Roberts is getting better and better, and I thought she was "getting better" with "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," but she wasd great in "Closer." Her preformance in this is very different from "Ocean's Twelve," but she was just having a good time while making that. Clive Owen had to be the highlight here, because he was the most nasty in the film. You spend the movie trying to figure out which characters you like and which you don't, when you  realize that you can't like any of them, because all they do is lie and cheat. "Closer" is a stark picture of reality, and while it takes a while for it to sink in that we are like these people, in the end, it's something that you think about for a long time. I think the people that don't like it, don't want to admit that truth to themselves. People are not always nice and caring and loving and willing to commit, and this movie proves it. This is one of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated R for sequences of graphic sexual dialogue, nudity/sexuality and language.<br /><br />The rating seems harsh, but the movie itself wasn't as bad it it makes it out to be. Pretty much no graphic images here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DAMIEN IS BACK"></head><body><p>Was a remake of the classic 1976 film necessary?  Not really.  Is this remake a good movie?  Yes.  As good as the original?  Almost.  In this updated version, our hellboy Damien returns and even though there's not a whole lot of difference between the two films, the movie still packs a dramatic punch.  If you've never seen the original, you'll enjoy this a little more than those of us who still remember Gregory Peck Lee Remick and Billie Whitelaw's chilling performances.  But to the new version's credit, the faithfulness to the original is what makes it worthwhile viewing for fans of the genre.<br /><br />Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles are the parents of the little hellion; they don't bring the same kind of intensity Peck and Remick did, but they do okay for themselves; David Thewlis is David Warner-worthy; and Pete Postelthwaite as the doomed priest is impressive.  The deaths for the most part are staged as in the original, although they're a little more graphic.  Stiles' final scene doesn't pack the emotional wallop of Remick's demise in the original, but it works for this film.  Mia Farrow is very good as the nanny in a change of pace role, but her final showdown with Schrieber isn't as impressive as Peck and Whitelaw's confrontation.  The scene in the cemetary when they discover the jackal is hauntingly spooky, and the addition of snow on the ground adds to this terror.<br /><br />Overall, THE OMEN is a good remake, and even if you've seen the original, you should enjoy this one, too.</p></body></html>

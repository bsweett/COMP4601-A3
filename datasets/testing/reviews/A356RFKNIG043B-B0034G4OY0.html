<meta name="summary" content="Cinematic limbo"></head><body><p>Despite a great cast, intelligent script and interesting concept.<br />Despite a master of concision at the helm (after seeing this and J. Edgar, perhaps former master).<br />Despite a subject I'm fascinated with.<br />Despite these and many other potential positives, Hereafter is just toooooo daaaarrrnnnn slooooowwwww. I could barely stay awake, and it was the afternoon.<br />Thought it was my fault. Rented it months later. Identical response.<br />Looks good, feels pretty real, everybody clearly put their heart into it, but it just didn't click for me.<br />More than once I wondered if this is what limbo feels like.<br />Perhaps that's the point. But that's not a feeling I usually seek when watching movies, and when it is Ingmar awaits.<br />If you love Clint and Matt and the subject, this might do it for you.<br />But I love all three, and no go.<br />Well made nonetheless, perhaps Hereafter was just made for a different mind than mine.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Taut heist flick, but still just a heist flick"></head><body><p>I've often found Spike Lee to be hit or miss as a director... This time around, it's a little in the middle.  "Inside Man" is a bank heist film, one of hundreds of films in a moribund corner of the crime film world. It's also a hostage-negotiation film, with Lee's four-time leading man, Denzel Washington, in the role of a police negotiator whose personal life is on the edge: at times he has the tactfulness of a falling anvil, and yet he is smart enough to match wits with the heist's mastermind, intensely played by Clive Owen.<br /><br />The mechanics and motivations of the heist itself are pretty compelling: this looks like a master plan that could work. Where the film fizzles in in the presentation of a plot beyond the clime, and the introduction of a rather ricketty set of circumstances involving municipal and corporate corruption (the bank's CEO is evil, and he leans on the mayor to obstruct the police in the middle of the hostage crisis -- not very likely) Jodie Foster plays a shadow-world heavy, hired by the CEO to make sure that his personal safety deposit box is not opened by the robbers (spoiler alert: it is their target) and, unbelievably, she is given access to the crime scene and spars briefly with Denzel, who despite his character's maverick nature, lets her meet with the bad guys.  This whole meta-plot is a dud -- it just rings false on every level, which is a shame, since the heist itself is kind of exciting.  If Lee had left well enough alone, and just made this an exciting genre film, it would have been fun.  The added-on political commentary seems grafted on and phony, it fails to resonate politically, and it an utter failure in dramatic terms.  That being said, the film is watchable and often engrossing, but it lacks the finesse and intensity of, say, Lee's far superior crime film, "25."  It's an okay film, but it lurches to the ending.

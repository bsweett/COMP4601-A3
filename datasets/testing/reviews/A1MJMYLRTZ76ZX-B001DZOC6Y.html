I've liked everything I've seen until now, even though he's never come close to equalling The Sixth Sense.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie may go down in cinematic history as one of the worst movies of all time. I give it two stars just because the idea of plants attacking humans with some kind of chemical is original. There haven't been very many movies made where plants are the bad guys. Old time sci-fi fans will recall the classic Day of the Trifids, based on the famous John Wyndham novel; Little Shop of Horrors, which was more of a dark comedy; and there was an original mid-60s Outer Limits episode where flowers were zapping  people with clouds of deadly spores (although flowering plants actually have seeds, not spores), not to mention the cult low budget satire, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Those films were, however, memorable, but this one unfortunately is not.<br /><br />I note that there are at this point over 180 one-star reviews, and only about 40 five star-reviews, so I'm not the only one who thought this movie was a turkey, and I admit to being easily entertained when it comes to movies. I've hardly ever given a movie one or two stars, so if I think it's bad, it's probably pretty terrible.<br /><br />The first problem is the more than awkward script, which Wahlberg struggles valiantly with but it's basically hopeless. The relationship between him and Zooey (Deschanel) is never really developed. And although Wahlberg's performance is decent despite the mediocre material, Deschanel seems to spend most of the movie with this deer in the headlights look of stupefaction on her face which just gets tiresome after the first 15 minutes. I don't know his name, but the guy who plays the nerdy horticulturalist was good. Unfortunately, he disappears after a few scenes and isn't used again in the movie, which is too bad. The science behind the whole concept is poorly developed, despite the TV interview with some biologist Ph.D. at the end of the movie, who adds a few more scant details, but that's about it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the problem with making plants the bad guys is that they're just not that dynamic as villains. The only thing Shyamalan can do to indicate a possibly impending attack is to have a stiff breeze blow at all the people, with everyone running around frantically trying to get indoors and close all the doors and windows. With plants as the bad guys, it's hard to run anywhere since plants are everywhere, and much of the action is just these big groups of hapless survivors traipsing down roads or across fields hoping that the local vegetation doesn't yet have it in for them. This means the movie must rely more on psychological suspense (although the people offing themselves in various grisly ways does provide a macabre sort of action), which Shyamalan is usually very good at, but here it just falls flat.<br /><br />I also have to agree with the other writers here that the scene where the guy walks into the lion's cage at the zoo is just laughably bad even if it might be Shyamalan's allusion to cheesy, 50s "B" movie, horror flicks. But that scene was bad even by those standards. ;-(<br /><br />One knowledgeable reviewer here said of Shyamalan's work, "Shyamalan's movies are getting worse with every release. Sixth Sense fantastic; Unbreakable interesting; Signs entertaining; The Village ok; Lady in the Water awful; The Happening unwatchable." I think that's a pretty good summary of his career arc so far. Unfortunately, The Happening doesn't really happen at all and (to borrow a funny line from a review of another bad movie) "just wilts, flaccid, on the vine."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Love Story gone bad...very bad.  Christina Ricci: heart breaker, or heart broken?"></head><body><p>Only Hollywood magic could transform Charlize Theron into this character, as she portrays a real serial killer.<br /><br />Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci fall in love, and I am so happy.  Then the proverbial s41t hits the fan, and the unhappy hooker (Theron) goes psycho.<br /><br />You thought some of your ex-s and lovers were tough?  The unhappy hooker, a delusional loser, finds a second chance, gains romance, then goes off the deep end.  Christina Ricci is young, naive, and runs away to live happily ever after with her girlfriend.  Stop the movie, and all is well.  Continue the movie, and experience the result of way too much pent up aggression literally exploding.  The hooker struggles desperately to retain her new life, love, and she tries to go straight.<br /><br />Without education, the hooker thinks she can waltz into an office and simply attain a real job.  She has no education, credentials, or manners, so the real world is much tougher than she expected.  Trying to make a nice home for her young lover, she strives to provide.  Sounds like a nice drama or romance to cuddle up to, eh?<br /><br />Suffice to say that the hooker kills the mood.  Poor little (maybe not so naive) Christina Ricci becomes tough, and things progressively get weirder.<br /><br />If you don't dig the psycho drama, tension, or criminal theme, you may enjoy the lesbian romance as it unfolds in unusual ways.</p></body></html>

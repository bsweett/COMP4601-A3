<meta name="summary" content="Pacino and De Niro together"></head><body><p>Most of the comments I've read here agree that this is a great movie. I have seen opinion. The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro's character (Neil). His personal conflicts are strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of the film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally.</p></body></html>

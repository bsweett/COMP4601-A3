<meta name="summary" content="Arguably the best zombie movie ever made"></head><body><p>Few filmmakers now how to do a zombie movie and get it right; I hate to think what the zombie movie genre would be without George Romero.  1968's Night of the Living Dead is still the archetype of zombie films, in my opinion, featuring a virtually perfect ending.  1979's follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, is another true classic, featuring scenes so shocking that absolutely no one under 17 could be admitted to theaters to see it.  By today's standards, the film is hardly shocking at all, but Romero's up close and personal look at a nihilistic world simply crawling with the undead is the kind of movie that makes horror lovers stand up and cheer.  The level of violence in this film is delightfully high; sure, it all looks pretty fake now, but in its day Dawn of the Dead helped lay the groundwork for later gorefests full of blood and guts.<p>I don't, as a general rule, care for zombies or zombie movies.  Zombies are ugly and stupid - they basically just wander around in a clumsy manner, only reacting to the nearness of human life fresh for the taking (and eating).  That's about all they do here, as well, but at least they turn out in huge numbers for this George Romero classic.  We don't know what started the trouble; as the movie opens, the world is already in a heap of a mess.  There are cops and soldiers killing zombies by the dozens, but it's obviously just a few bloods drops in the proverbial bucket.  <p>TV news coverage features experts saying how bad everything is and how we should have taken action sooner, demanding people leave their self-barricaded homes and come together in a dwindling number of central locations.  Roger DeMarco (Scott H. Reiniger) flies his girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) and friend Stephen Andrews (David Emge) out of town in a helicopter - Stephen's sharp-shooting buddy Peter Washington (Ken Foree) also comes along for the ride.  Low on gas and unsure of what they should do, the gang lands on the roof of a large shopping mall and eventually decides to hole up there for a while.  Isolating themselves upstairs, our would-be survivors then begin making forays inside the mall for necessary supplies.  The place is crawling with pasty-faced zombies, so they put together a plan that will, or so they hope, keep additional zombies from gaining access to the site; once that is done, it's just a matter of killing all of the zombies already stumbling around inside.  Of course, as we all know, people are stupid, so this prolonged stay inside the mall faces its share of challenges and dangers.  Along the way, countless numbers of zombies are shot, bludgeoned, and taken out with whatever deadly instruments one happens to find handy.  Never fear, there is some zombie feeding as well, although once again I have to express my disappointment that no brains were ever eaten (zombies are supposed to eat brains - that's my personal zombie philosophy).  One question hovers near the front of your mind throughout this film: how will it end?  The world has basically come to an end, making for some long odds for our heroes' survival.  While the ending is not completely satisfying, I do believe it makes for a right and fitting conclusion to this most extraordinary of horror classics.<p>Let me speak to the violence portrayed here.  However shocking it was upon the movie's release, it really isn't shocking at all in this day and age; the quantity of violence, though still impresses.  Plenty of zombies fall over the course of these two hours plus, but few of the &quot;deaths&quot; are what I would call gory.  In many cases, a zombie takes a shot between the eyes and falls down; in some cases there is blood, especially when zombies get a chance to do a little feeding, but you certainly won't see anybody lying in a pool of blood.  In many cases, a zombie gets taken out with no blood at all - certainly, the amount of gore you would expect from shotgun blasts to the head just doesn't exist here.  The blood, I might also mention, doesn't even look like blood - unless red corpuscles changed to orange corpuscles without anyone telling me.<p>In the end, it comes down to this: Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made - more than that, it's one of the best horror films ever made.  It cemented George Romero's name in the hallowed shrines of horror; it crossed the Rubicon (or perhaps I should say the river Styx) and dared to give viewers the quantity of senseless violence so many of us crave.  There is also a sociological slant to the movie that many feel compelled to comment on (I personally think it's something of a stretch to classify four desperate, would-be survivors as some type of bourgeoisie enjoying the luxury the shopping mall affords them while the nameless hordes of plebeian zombies mill around aimlessly).  However you want to interpret it, Dawn of the Dead is horror at its very best, up close and in your face.</p></body></html>

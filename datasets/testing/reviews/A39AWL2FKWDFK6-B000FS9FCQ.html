<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding and critical futuristic fantasy"></head><body><p>The dulcet and eloquent articulation by Hugo Weaving playing futuristic revolutionary known as V belies the powerful message of the film.  Director James McTeigue working with a script provided by the Wachowski brothers and based of the novel by Alan Moore creates a socially critical film in the mode of the classic story "1984".<br /><br />In the year 2020 worldwide conflicts have fueled the creation of a totalitarian society in England led by the unyielding, dictatorial Chancellor Adam Sutler played powerfully by the accomplished John Hurt.  Having quashed the ideals of intellectuals, citizens live under fear of reprisal for wrong thinking.  Under these repressive conditons arises V, a lone voice attempting by terroristic acts to alter the shape of society.<br /><br />During one of V's escapades, he comes into contact with working girl Evey Hammond played by Natalie Portman.  She comes to his aid as he attempts to take control of the government run television station where she works.  They form an uneasy bond at first and V takes Evey in his confidence.  We learn that both Weaving and Portman are products of their society.  V was a survivor of a government sponored experiment into biologic warfare.  Portman survived the destruction of her family at the hands of an unsympathetic government.<br /><br />V who stealthily gets around in swashbuckling fashion cloaked with a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film, has designs to make a stupendous terroristic statement on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5th.  He schools Evey in his philosophy and together they work towards making major changes into societal structure.<br /><br />The special effects and visual imagery were prodigious and the stunt work was also first rate.  Weaving, Portman and Hurt were all impressive in their portrayals.  Despite the cartoonish nature of the film, it did provide relevant critiques into authoritarian societies which deny its members a freedom of choice.</p></body></html>

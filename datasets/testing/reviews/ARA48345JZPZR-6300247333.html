<meta name="summary" content="The Omen minus the Shocks...."></head><body><p>Let's face it, the reason the orginal Omen was such a sensation was due to an impaling and a decapitation presented on-screen with fully realized state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects, along with some creepy choral music and the central idea of an evil little kid.  Throw in a hanging, viscious dogs, spooky graveyards and an A-List cast to make it all acceptable and there you have a box office hit.<br /><br />So, what about this remake?  Good cast.  Even better special effects.  Good production.  What's missing?  The shocks.  We all know what's coming and therefore suspense and disbelief at what we're seeing is nowhere in sight.<br /><br />When I saw the original it was truly spooky and suspensful and the murders were actually shocking.  We really hadn't seen it done like that before.  Watching this one, I very much like the actors involved and the production and direction were fine, and they did some slight riffing on the main murders, but I expected them and they came where and when they were supposed to, so no surprise and over-all nothing has really been added or enhanced from the original.  And the Japanese have made evil & creepy kids (especially little girls????) the new mainstay of horror films.<br /><br />The 3 stars are because this was well done and would probably work for an audience that had never seen the original.  But, like Psycho, there was no real reason to re-make this film, and it is impossible to recreate the shock of the first viewing of the originals.  As a faithful remake, at least they did a good job of it, if for no discernible purpose.</p></body></html>

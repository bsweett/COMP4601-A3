When John Lennon was murdered. (So far, too young for all of these.) When Princess Diana was killed (having a sleepover with my ex-best friend.) When September 11th happened - I was on holiday in the UK at the time. My now boyfriend had come home early from college, as he wasn't feeling great. I remember walking back to our caravan (how quaint) and someone in a neighbouring caravan telling us to switch on the news. We sat and watched the news unfold, and I still have a diary somewhere which I wrote in everything we were getting told, and how I was feeling. For some reason, I was worrying my friends back home in Scotland, even though we were still many miles away from New York.<br /><br />Flight 93, United 93 and World Trade Center all seemed to come about at the same time. I'm still not sure why. To make films of other people's suffering. But they're out there now, we can't stop them, all we can do is try and put ourselves in their place.<br /><br />World Trade Center is very well acted, with a brilliant cast consisting of Nicholas Cage (with a very bad moustache), Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jay Hernandez, Stephen Dorff and Michael Pe&ntilde;a. It's so well acted in fact you actually forget you're watching a film. I was holding my breath during some points in the film, and was nearly in tears at other points. Watching re-runs of the original news footage, was quite emotional. I do agree with some reviewers, that it did focus a bit too much on the two police officers stuck in the rubble - I had it in my head it was actually going to be them IN the World Trade Center, not stuck underneath the rubble. But it was brilliantly acted by Nicholas & Michael, it must have been so claustrophobic during those scenes and flat on their backs, amongst the 240 tons of material that was used to recreate a fully 3-dimensional Ground Zero in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The film spares the feelings for the people that were actually there, by not using footage of the planes actually striking the Twin Towers. We're shown how little the officers knew at the time, as they prepared to evacuate North Tower, they had no idea South Tower had even been hit.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello play the worried wives back home, anxiously waiting for news. Maria's character has four children with Nicholas's character, and Maggie is 5 months pregnant with their second child.<br /><br />After everything that has happened since 2001, a pointless war in Iraq which has done nothing but let even more people grieve, and attacks in London, it seems nothing can be done, unless the Americans come together and get a new President. As recently as a couple of weeks ago in 2007, Tony Blair finally stepped down as Prime Minister in the UK, and Bush should follow.<br /><br />I don't think any more films should be made about 9/11. 2,700+ people were lost that day, and with a mere three films out there retelling the story, it can't be pleasant for any Americans. Let them grieve Hollywood.</p></body></html>

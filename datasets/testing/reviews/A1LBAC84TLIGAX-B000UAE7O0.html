<meta name="summary" content="WOW!  9.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Planet Terror quite simply is an UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME ZOMBIE FILM! This is one of the most violent, most bizarre, and most action-packed zombie films ever made. It's bloody, it has a cast of demented characters, lots of guns, a hot one-legged woman with a gun for a leg, and it even has a small guest appearance from Tom Savini (The make-up and gore effects maker for Romero's Dead franchise, and makes small guest appearances in both Dawn of the Dead films). What is there not to love about this film?<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a container is broken, a deadly gas is released and it starts turning people in the nearby town into the hungry undead. Now a rogue group of survivors must kill their way through the undead and fight off another group from killing them. The cast of characters is insane. One is girl with a gun for a leg, a woman who is a former doctor who has obsession with needles and likes women, a criminal who is a very good shot with his guns, a man obsessed with keeping his barbeque recipe secret, a cop who hates the criminal, two angry and abusive twin sisters, an owner of strip club, and a man who cuts the balls off of  his enemies and keeps them in jars or bags, and even crazier characters are in this film.<br />MUSIC: This film has music similar to films from the 70's, and it fits the mood quite well.<br />ACTION: The film has a grainy quality to it like a 70's film. This film is very bloody, loaded with blood, guts, and severed limbs all over the place. This film is also loaded with shootouts and mature material that certainly earns the Unrated label. This is no film for kids for its mature material and disgusting bloody violence. This film is absolutely awesome, but is only for adults.<br />ACTING: This is an all-star cast, and with them comes great acting with their roles. I loved the actors and I loved the demented characters they played.<br />OVERALL: Fantastic! Nearly perfect! A must-have for any zombie fanatic.<br />THE GOOD: Lots of blood, lots of guts, lots of guns, great acting, great storytelling, lots of action, the 70's retro feel, and the mock trailer for the mock film Machete (Really funny and vulgar).<br />THE BAD: Some scenes go a little too far over the top.</p></body></html>

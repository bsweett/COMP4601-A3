<meta name="summary" content="Transvestites, yipes!"></head><body><p>This one shows up on Turner Classics every once in a while, but I hadn't focused till the other night. There's something creepy about dressing like a woman. Some burly men may have no qualms, but I find transvestites, ahh, uncomfortable.  I know.  It's me and there's nothing wrong with that.  In Some Like It Hot, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are cross-dressing to escape some killers.  They're not very attractive as women, which allowed me to enjoy the sex identity farce.  Farce in America means screwball comedy.  If Monroe crawled into my Pullman berth to sleep, hmm -- Lemmon pops one no doubt, and I'm not sure it was in the script if you know what I mean.  Then he's swarmed by bunches of scantily clad ladies and the fun escalates.  Monroe wears two dresses that give an interesting illusion. What a bod.</p></body></html>

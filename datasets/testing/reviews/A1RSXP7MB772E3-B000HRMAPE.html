Wasn't used more with Cruise, in what could have been excitingly impossible to eyewitness dully. The two are powerhouse actors. And I couldn't help but have a bad taste of knowing too much personal information about both Ethan Hawk and for that matter, the person playing him in real life: Cruise. Don't get me wrong, I was in no way influenced by the obvious antics by Tom, but at the same time, miss the time in cinema when agents protected their actors from too much public investigation.<br />There were signs to me, when the small screen director seemed unable to produce bigscreen action. Besides the long scoops on tight sequences, which could have been spider man for all the ambiguity of the impersonal angles, There was a point when yet another impossible break and enter was required and everything seemed poised for another catwalk from the room to a supervault fiercely protected by guards, but then we wait along with the van and twiddle our fingers expecting the inevitable: Cruise with a most urgent story of his escape and of course, the goods. Or, the rabbits foot. Jeffrey Abrams does have youthfull passion for his work and it shows in his deliberatly implied ehtics, such as a reduced amount of gore, and a pychological beginning, thrusting you into an immediate thrill house, and seizing your attention onto a sizzling bomb fuse and immediately switching to a friendly espousal between new wife and husband. Cruise and Wagner productions last feature film has an open, chapter-to-be-continued feel that all Bond films end with but is rather a closer to a very established production company. Will he be teamed with his wife in impossible situations for the next? Will there be a next? Perhaps, but more that that, promise me director of the future, that whatever the story between wife and husband, assuming that you have yet another awesome combination of super actors, use them for God's sake!</p></body></html>

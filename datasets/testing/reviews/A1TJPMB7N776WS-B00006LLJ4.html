<meta name="summary" content="The Sniffer"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg has fashioned a sleek, physically beautiful, most of the time engrossing film set in Washington DC, in the future 50 years hence.<br />John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is an elite "pre-crime" cop whose department uses pre-cognizants (fortune tellers, really) to fortell where and when murders will occur. Anderton's crew then responds by stopping the crime before it happens.<br />Anderton is a troubled soul having lost his 6 yr old son under mysterious circumstances as well as his wife in divorce. Through the use of up to date technology he is able to view his son and wife by way of magical, life-like 3-D images; which he does nightly in scenes brought about by remorse as well as the inhalation of drugs he buys off the street.<br />Tom Cruise, having finally lived through his boyish good looks, gives an extremely resonant, muti-faceted performance: he is asked to be emotionally aware as well as physically polished and he is much more effective and emphathetic here than he was in "Vanilla Sky."<br />Colin Farrel, a part of the new guard of young actors; excellent in "Tigerland", does a remarkable job of playing off and with both Cruise and Max Von Sydow. In this he plays a District Attorney lackey out to confiscate the "pre-crime" technology for the Government and uses any means possible to do so.<br />Spielberg uses Hitchcock as his guiding force for the last third of the film as it turns into a chase film/thriller with Anderton on the run from the people he once supervised.  There are big chunks of film comparable to the very best of "Rear Window"and "Vertigo." I think that the film runs on too long by about 10 minutes but this a a minor quibble.<br />Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report"is an interesting, heart-felt, emotionally true and physically beautiful film with sympathetic portrayals by Cruise, Farrell, Von Sydow and Samantha Morton as one of the pre-cognizants.  All concerned should be proud of their accomplisment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Sweet Smell of Obsession"></head><body><p>As the title suggests, "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is a pure sensory experience, enveloping the audience into a seemingly unending and unconquerable world of scents. It was absolutely amazing that the filmmakers managed to immerse us in such a rich and varied realm: we're incapable of actually smelling the images as they appear on the screen. Nonetheless, we're able to understand what we're being asked to experience along with the main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), who was born with an inhumanly strong sense of smell. As he wanders the streets of eighteenth-century France, his nose acts like a filing cabinet, collecting countless numbers of odors and storing them in his memory. Everything emitting a scent is shown to us through some clever camera angles, most of which are extreme close-ups of objects and bodies moving in slow motion.<br /><br />This first-hand look into Grenouille's world made for quite a unique experience, especially since we're being asked to address a sense that's quite useless for film watching. But his obsessive and ultimately murderous drive to capture the perfect scent enables us to transcend that handicap; even if we can't smell what he smells, various shots enable us to understand that he finds the scents of the world intoxicating. We also gain understanding with the help of John Hurt, the film's narrator. He's quite an important character, considering Grenouille is a young man of very few words. According to some background information, he didn't learn to speak for many years. He was unceremoniously born underneath a foul-smelling fish cart in Paris, the fifth child of a woman whose previous four children were stillborn.<br /><br />After she's arrested and executed for willful neglect, the infant is sent to an orphanage, and there he remains throughout his entire childhood. It's established almost immediately how unnerved the other children are around the now named Grenouille; he cannot speak, yet he develops a peculiar sense of smell, one that makes him perceptive to everyone around him. This marks the first in a series of plot devices that almost come off as supernatural, a quality that, if not viewed in the right frame of mind, may come off as completely ridiculous. There are a number of moments in this film that require suspension of disbelief. This is especially true of the final major sequence, in which a spur of the moment orgy takes place in the town square.<br /><br />This isn't to say that they detract from the effectiveness of the story. If anything, they enhance it. Keep in mind that Grenouille is a unique individual; not only is his sense of smell incredibly powerful, he also has no scent of his own. He doesn't learn this until he's older, at which point he's already been sold as cheap labor to a tannery owner.<br /><br />But this is when things take a much darker turn, and they only get darker as the film progresses. After years of remaining behind the confining walls of the tannery, Grenouille is finally asked to assist in making deliveries. At last, he has the chance to take in the various odors of the city, all of which he has yet to distinguish as bad or good. Then he gets a whiff of a young girl selling yellow plums, and the seduction is complete. He's not interested in buying any of her fruit; he only wants to bask in her heavenly aroma. Unfortunately, restraining her and choking her to death brings him no closer to capturing her scent. He then understands his purpose in life; he shall find the world's most enticing smells, collect them, and make them into a one-of-a-kind perfume.<br /><br />And as luck would have it, he makes a delivery to Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), an Italian perfumer. At one time, he was well respected and his shop was always full of customers. Now it seems as if he's past his prime, his attempts at creating the next great perfume being thwarted by rival businesses. But then he meets Grenouille, whose powerful nose allows him to pick out exactly the right scents and mix them in exactly the right amounts. Finally, he's found someone who can put him back in business. In becoming an amateur perfumer, Grenouille hopes to learn the fine art of capturing scents.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Baldini is only familiar with one capturing method: distilling various flora and fauna by boiling them in water. Grenouille's pursuits are far too grand for this method, and it shows through his unsuccessful attempts at distilling the essences of glass, various metals, and Baldini's cat (supposedly for the sake of experimentation). His only other option is a method used in Grasse, a city known for producing the highest quality perfumes: it involves animal fat, which can easily absorb scents. After the fat has been slathered onto flower petals, it is then scraped away, mixed with alcohol, and distilled into concentrated oil. Grenouille immediately leaves for Grasse, knowing that this method will serve his purpose.<br /><br />At this point, his obsession turns deadly; he kills a number of young girls, capturing their scents by slathering their naked bodies with animal fat, scraping it off, and boiling it with alcohol. I remember how uncomfortable I felt watching the fat sizzling in glass beakers; we're essentially witnessing a madman bottling youth, beauty, and innocence, all of which were previously impossible to collect. The very thought of someone being both skilled and heartless is not exactly pleasant, especially since he needs one more victim to perfect his perfume. Here enters Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), a young virgin who lives with her loving father, Antoine (Alan Rickman). Capturing her scent won't be so easy; Grenouille's murder spree has definitely gotten the city's attention.<br /><br />Such a fascinatingly dark story was enough to get my attention, as well; despite disturbing visuals and heavy-handed subject matter, "Perfume" is not easily dismissible. I watched it with grim focus, and I found myself waiting impatiently for the next turn of events. I don't know if I'm helping the film or hurting it by saying that they lead to a particularly odd ending; while I consider it appropriate, some my find it nonsensical and in poor taste. But you have to keep in mind that a supernatural story is being told. It may not seem that way at first; initial appearances make it seem like a straightforward period piece. But as soon as the infant Grenouille inhales the scent of an orphan boy's index finger, it becomes obvious that extraordinary things will happen. A lot of credit has to be given to such a film, especially one in which the everyday sense of smell is successfully woven into the narrative fabric.</p></body></html>

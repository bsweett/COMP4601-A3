<meta name="summary" content="Low Credibility"></head><body><p>This movie is violent and frightening. Some scenes will really make you clench your teeth. When the lead character tries to deceive the homicidal maniac into thinking he's already killed everyone in the house, she works fast - trying to erase in a flash all signs that's she's been occupying the upstairs guest room. Then she hides. The killer senses some additional occupant and slowly, excruciatingly examines the room. A single telltale drop of water oozing from the lip of the faucet suggests a sink that was recently used - and therefore suggests someone left alive. Fee, fi, fo, fum... The tension attached to this discovery is almost unbearable. We have here a maniac who's more than just a killing machine. This maniac has some wile and some capacity for outwitting his victims.<br /><br />However, this movie ends up by outwitting itself. It tries to be so surprising that it leaps right into the realm of the totally unbelievable.<br /><br />The twist ending it contrives is both physically and psychologically implausible in the extreme. A particularly gruesome scene that occurs early in the film becomes especially inexplicable in light of the final revelations.<br /><br />Cecile De France's lithe athleticism is compelling on screen as she resists the savage onslaughts of the killer. The French subtitles aren't a chore because there's not that much dialogue. And the movie was a thrill ride the first time around.<br /><br />However when I viewed it through the second time, with some of the suspense stripped away, I could be more critical. I saw how the U-turn the film takes causes it to lose all credibility. While the story line might seem to maintain high-tension tautness at first, it definitely goes slack when you examine the premise.</p></body></html>

I remember seeing that parody on HBO years ago and it was before seeing the "actual" film. The scene where Richard Dreyfuss looks at the shaving cream and says "This means something," I still haven't recovered myself from restraining the laugh-fest. Maybe someday that parody and "Hardware Wars," can make an appearance on DVD! <p>It wasn't until the Special Edition came out in theatres where I finally got to see it with all the added scenes. Yet, after watching this DVD version I love it! The movie most definitely does better without all the added stuff. The sound and picture are better than it ever was in theatres but that's also a testament to explain how far the technology of sound has come from. Let's face it, I saw the Special Edition in theatres in 82! Sound has most definitely improved since then, thank God! The picture quality is unbelievable and after watching "Superman The Movie" it's great to see our classic films get the facelift they deserve, even though most of these actors need facelifts of their own:) Just kidding!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pixar Proves There the best in the business"></head><body><p>One thing I love about Pixar is the fact that they, lo and behold, do something different each time they make a movie.  Aside from the fact that Pixar adds as much for older people as it does for younger (as a matter of fact, I actually like Pixar more now than I did when I was younger), close inspection shows that they try new styles and new concepts each movie.  Pixar's The Incredibles is one of their most different, being a great action movie, an animation feast, a story that more often than not err, clicks with you, humor that's more than mere toilet humor, and another memorable cast of characters added to the already populated Pixar library of memorable characters.<br /><br />First off One of Pixar's benefits is using animation to create worlds unlike any other, and they did it so with The Incredibles despite the fact this movie could have been live action.  Besides, if they did it live action, this movie wouldn't look half as good as it does.  The animation is more simple compared to some of their other movies, but it's slick, sometimes simple comic book style (looks similar to Team Fortress, whatever style that's supposed to be) makes it's lounge-cool.  The use of Googie architecture is a big plus because I love that style, and slick effects and cool gadgets galore make their way into the world of the Incredibles.  Michael Giacchino's John Barry/caper-influenced score further adds to it's slickness.<br /><br />Incredibles once again gets some great voice talents (including Tarantino's most frequent collaborator.  Yes I had to say that), and the characters here are all glorious mash ups of different superheroes.  For example, Bob Parr is like a mix between The Thing and an actual person, and Elastigirl is another character that stretches like Plasticman.  Sure, none of them are that original, but there powers sure make for some sight gags, action sequences, and many situations that arise or feature the use of their natural powers (the bickering between the family during the dinner scene, for example).  All of these characters are likable, and while I don't feel they are as likable as some of Pixar's other movies (I wish there was a dog exactly like Dug), they still add for some very relatable situations.<br /><br />As for the villain himself Syndrome, I found him to be very interesting, reasonably ripped off at a young age but pitiful in his inability to forgive others to the point of extreme bitterness and plenty of sadistic tendencies.  He basically murders people by the thousands and the only way for him to get respect is to be a two-faced liar.  Even though he's loathsome, I think it's also a good cautionary tale for liking yourself and not idolizing others, because chances are the people who you idolize don't think of you as profound as you want them.  It's why I don't idolize anybody and am always my own main interest.<br /><br />It could be said that the superhero family is merely a gimmick for a movie that features satire that's painfully obvious.  But then again, it's enjoyable because it's straightforward satire, and nothing else.  No weird American Beauty-like symbolism and outlandish situations, just straightforward down to earth empty family life.  Kind of like Faces (John Cassavetes who most of you have probably never heard of) but the characters actually fix their family life and it ends on a much more positive note.  Those who complained about the ending being bright and cheery are stupid.  To me, that's called getting more out of life.<br /><br />I still don't exactly relate to everything here being that I'm not even in my 20's, but then again, thinking of what it's like to have a job you hate everyday and absolutely nothing different in your life is kind of depressing when you think about it.  What a hollow life.  It may not ring home with me as it does with the middle age people (Brad Bird himself based it off of his experience, so I don't think this movie was made to pander), but it's funny and understandable even to a person who doesn't have the full gist of what it's like to be middle age.<br /><br />But it's not an all serious all depressing movie by any stretch, The Incredibles is super fun and at times, super funny (no pun intended).  There are some very witty moments in here, the capes scene is classic, and I just love Edna Mode's gleeful passion of her costumes during the scene where she shows her new decided costumes, while Helen just stares with mixed feelings, having no idea how to react to something on display.  The concept of superheroes being sued is very clever, and this movie is, to sum it up short, fun.  Incredibles is great fun as an action movie, while not violent, but creative as well.<br /><br />For a PG movie, The Incredibles has some really entertaining action scenes, proving that you don't need gore and Bay style intensity to make a good action movie.  The Incredibles delivers great action sequences, creative and varied, even topped off with sound design that was rightfully awarded at The Academy Awards.  I'd even go this far and say if you put a gun to my head and asked me to pick either the Incredibles, Sin City, and 300 for action, I would easily pick the Incredibles.  I love both of those movies,  but the Incredibles really has some of the most entertaining, creative, and even easy to follow action sequences in recent memory.<br /><br />This is the last DVD of a Pixar movie that features loads and loads of delightfully entertaining special features that surely gets the most out of your DVD experience.  Then Cars was released and it all went to consumer hell, charging a whole extra DVD for _________ Spanish version alone.  Cheap ____________.  Never mind my rant.  Incredibles is not quite incredible, but it's still yet another winner from Pixar.  Cliched to say so?  Maybe.  However, one thing is for sure, Pixar keeps on showing that they know how to entertain audiences in the best ways possible for the best ways possible.</p></body></html>

The dynamic of father and son provided an excellent chance for the writers and directors to have a truly dynamic story, but alas it failed to deliver.<br /><br />The special effects were awesome. If that's all you want from a movie (Giant tornadoes, snow-covered landslides and mountains of water filling the streets of coastal America) you'll be pleased with this movie.<br /><br />If, however, you want a plot, storyline and viable conclusion, you will be (as I was) greatly disappointed.<br /><br />For a movie of this type to work, you have to care about the characters. Writers and directors of the future, take note of that!</p></body></html>

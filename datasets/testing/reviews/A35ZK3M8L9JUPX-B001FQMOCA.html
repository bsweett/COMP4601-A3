<meta name="summary" content="Walk the Line"></head><body><p>In 1955, a tough, skinny guitar-slinger who called himself J.R. Cash walked into the soon-to-be-famous Sun Studios in Memphis. It was a moment that would have an indelible effect on American culture. With his driving freight-train chords, steel-eyed intensity and a voice as deep and black as night, Cash sang blistering songs of heartache and survival that were gutsy, full of real life and unlike anything heard before. That day kicked off the electrifying early career of Johnny Cash. This movie is the worthy recap of a time in a man's life that is simply too large for any single movie. The movie is entertaining, reasonably true to the facts of Johnny Cash life and full of music.</p></body></html>

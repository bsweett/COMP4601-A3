Bombings, violence, and terrorism are common, apparently all due to the fact that several years prior, and this is the crucial idea, women stopped having babies.<br /><br />That's all just set-up though, as we haven't got to the plot of the movie, which is where Clive Owen's character, Theo comes in.  Theo is cynical about the world, and seems to be okay with just letting it go to the wayside, until his ex-wife meets up with him, and trusts in him a girl, more specifically a pregnant girl (which in a world without babies is pretty rare).  From there the adventure begins...<br /><br />Well, supposedly, because to me, this is sadly a simple, and obvious plot, and if it weren't for the exciting action sequences, particularly this one extremely long-shot sequence (which I will say is definitely impressive), then really I'd probably just give it two stars.  However, unlike most two-star films I sensed effort and some albeit limited success with that effort, thus my deeming this film as mediocre as a 3-star film can be (instead of the poorer 2-star).</p></body></html>

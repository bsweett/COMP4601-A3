I'm glad that I was wrong. This movie was absolutely incredible. I think what makes "The Punisher" such a great character is the fact that he's just a regular man driven by hatred and revenge. There are no capes, no flying, no gimmicks, no masks, no sidekicks, no gadgets, no moving at the speed of light, and no superhuman strength. He's just a regular man going through life with a tortured soul trying to avenge the brutal murder of his family, and you gotta love that part if nothing else. Thomas Jane was the perfect man for this role even though I didn't know much about any of his earlier work until this movie. The only thing my sister and I kept saying to ourselves is that Tom Jane really reminded us of the "Highlander" Chris Lambert (that's just an opinion of course). To keep it short though, I think it's worth watching at least once, but as with everything else, some will love it, and some will hate it. I LOVED IT!</p></body></html>

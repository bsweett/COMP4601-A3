<meta name="summary" content="Sleepless in Alaska"></head><body><p>Al Pacino plays an LA police detective who is being investigated by Internal Affairs and is brought to Alaska to work on the case of the killing of a 17-year-old girl.  A young police woman, played by Hilary Swank, is an admirer of his and she is thrilled to be working on a case with him.  An incident occurs during the investigation which turns everything upside down and threatens Pacino's career.  He forms an unholy alliance with a character played by Robin Williams and the rest of the movie is all about self-preservation and trying to be the last man standing.  Throughout the movie Pacino fights insomnia in the land of the Midnight Sun where darkness never falls.  The scenery in the movie is spectacular and the acting is very good.  This is recommended viewing for those who enjoy action/thrillers.</p></body></html>

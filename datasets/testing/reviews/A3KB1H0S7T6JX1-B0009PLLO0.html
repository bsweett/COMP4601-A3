<meta name="summary" content="Mixed emotions from Greece"></head><body><p>Alexander is a movie that brings to life the director's version of how he would have liked Alexander the Great to have been.  The movie does not faithfully follow the sources associated with the Greek hero (even though a historian was supposedly hired to do just that, though why an Englishman was chosen and not Greek is beyond my comprehension), rather it is a film BASED on and INSPIRED by the legendary conqueror, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the truth.<br /><br />One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied Greek History, it is common knowledge that the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...  From this very long list the most important alteration of course was in relation to his sexuality, which also seems to be Oliver Stone's main theme (!!!) in this film along with his relations with his parents.  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is Alexander the Great in question and not some modern leader/general.  Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read/studied the sources) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually occurred.  Consequently, due to these distortions, the movie establishes a very serious threat of producing armies of misinformed people who think they have accurate knowledge of Alexander the Great when they really do not.  That is NOT good!<br /><br />If that wasn't enough, Oliver Stone throughout the film, CONSTANTLY refers to homosexual relationships between men, when the existing evidence surrounding the issue of whether homosexuality in ancient Greece was more or less accepted than today is inconclusive and the issue itself is highly controversial; therefore, calling for EXTREME CAUTION when dealing with such matters.  He even goes as far as to proclaim that Achilles and Patroklos were lovers!  What people do in their own bedrooms is their own business, but to involve Greece's kings and legends in alleged homosexual acts, shows complete lack of respect as well as lack of basic/elementary knowledge of the era in question, with most frequent the misinterpretation of love between friends which did not include anything sexual or homosexual whatsoever!  The heroes themselves would be turning in their graves if they knew what is being written and said about them by people who are either misinformed or are purposely out to distort the truth in following their own personal agendas.<br /><br />Lastly, special emphasis must also be made in that the Snake (Olympias' "affection" towards snakes) is an animal holy to Greeks and not a fetish in the way that we might find it today in erotic fiction or medieval fantasy e.g. Conan the Barbarian etc.  Therefore, Olympias' caressing, kissing and even licking snakes is ludicrous to say the least!<br /><br />On the positive side, the movie is action packed, the special effects are great, the acting is very good (overall) and the cast are wonderful (overall).  Colin Farrel, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, and the rest of the actors (with the exception of Haephestion who could not be more feminine if he tried) have done a excellent job of providing an entertaining (!) film.  Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, and Rosario Dawson carry out superb performances, unlike Colin Farrel who falls short of being 100% convincing in his role.<br /><br />Hopefully, more films will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.</p></body></html>

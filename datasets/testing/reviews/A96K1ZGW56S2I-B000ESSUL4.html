<meta name="summary" content="A Lengthy Dream or a Moving Piece of Art."></head><body><p>THE NEW WORLD is supposedly a film about John Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe.  I say supposedly because even though the plot of the film is centered around the love triangle between the three, the film really has very little to do with them.  That's because this is a film written and directed by Terrence Malick.  Malick's movies have a style completely of their own and there is no other filmmaker who makes movies the way Malick does.  Malick's movies are like viewing a piece of continuous art that goes on for miles and miles.  Watching a Malick flick is akin to experiencing a long and peaceful dream.  The movie is filled with one beautiful image after another with very little dialogue.<br /><br />The plot of the film is taken from history.  It's the 17th Century and John Smith leads a company of men upriver from their Jamestown colony to trade with the Indians.  He's taken prisoner and falls in love with Princess Pocahontas.  Knowing that he is being depended upon, Smith returns to the colony.  The natives attack the colony.  Pocahontas is taken captive.  Smith is ordered to leave Jamestown.  John Rolfe, a rich tobacco farmer, arrives at Jamestown. Rolfe falls in love with Pocahontas.  The two are married.  Later she's reunited with Smith and has to decide whom she will spend her life with.<br /><br />Colin Farrell has a lot of screen time in the movie.  Personally I think this is one of Farrell's best performances ever.  Of course, that might have to do with the fact that he doesn't speak for over half of the film.  Q'Orianka Kilcher portrays Pocahontas and does a remarkable job.  Christian Bale portrays John Rolfe and though he's not as interesting as he is as Bruce Wayne, he's a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />I usually don't like art films.  I like a movie to have a great story told well, a movie with some great characterization, or a film that includes all of that.  I saw THIN RED LINE, Malick's previous picture, when it came out and it almost put me to sleep.  It was beautifully shot, but I just couldn't get into it.  Since then I've learned a thing or two about cinematography and I respect the type of pictures that Malick makes.  Even though I didn't like THE NEW WORLD as much as a movie such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or a solid drama like SIDEWAYS, I still enjoyed the movie.  It relaxed me and after viewing the film I had a very restful night of sleep.<br /><br />There are many people who will not enjoy THE NEW WORLD.  If someone believes THE NEW WORLD is a historical epic, they will be sorely disappointed.  If someone believes THE NEW WORLD is a movie full of action sequences, they will also be disappointed.  THE NEW WORLD is like a piece of art, you can only enjoy it if you are willing to explore it from every angle and even then it might not make complete sense.</p></body></html>

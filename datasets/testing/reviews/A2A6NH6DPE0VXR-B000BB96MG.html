After seeing it though, I think it's one of Burton's best. It's full of strange humor and great visuals. Roger Ebert said he didn't know what Johny Depp was trying to do in this movie as Willy Wonker. Well isn't it obvious what he was trying to do ? He was trying to be strange and unusual and he pulls it off great. He's not gonna be nominated 3 years in row though. As he's not as good as he was in Pirates of the Carribean or Finding Neverland. Gene Wilder's Willy Wonker seemed mysterious and almost sort of magical. This Willy is mysterious as well but looks like he'd eat the children that he doesn't like lol. Still though the movie has a likeable goofy charm to it, as does Depp. So I don't see where he's really a problem.<br /><br />  When the first trailer hit theatres and the internet. Fans of the original were already here writing bad reviews. Saying that the OOMPA LOOMPAs aren't what they should be like. Well they aren't freaky colored midgets. They're what Burton thought they should be like and they steal the show. They're clones of one small strange guy basically. It's great fun everytime they're on screen.<br /><br />  The whole movie is just an odd and darkly funny blast. I also think Danny Elfman does one of his best musical scores next to Batman and BeetleJuice. The flashbacks of Willy's childhood isn't really needed. Well although they are funny in a sick kind of way and Christopher Lee is great as his father. He's a dentist that makes Willy wear a huge thing of braces over his whole face. Of course he won't let him eat candy either and hates candy.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a lot more solid than the last time Burton attempted to do a remake. I could never get into the original and this is easy to get into.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like many Indiana Jones fans, I expected something better than this"></head><body><p>I thought that "Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade" was pretty bad, but this is the ultimate stinker!  Why did they do this?  Harrison Ford is old and decrepit these days.  The sound man probably had to edit out all his wheezing when he just bent down to pick up his hat.  So I can imagine he was struggling a lot with some of the scenes where a stuntman wouldn't work.  And that energetic "Indiana Jones" theme music was ridiculous to hear knowing that Harrison Ford was probably ready to pass out from running so much on the screen.<br /><br />No, I won't be buying this DVD.  God, I hope they don't do another "Indiana Jones", at least not with Harrison Ford.  It's OK to get another younger actor.  They do for James Bond and it seems to work.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones" is a great saga to continue (perhaps with a better story writer), but Harrison Ford should move on to something else.  How about "Grumpy Old Men III".<br /><br />I hope I can convince my kids to watch "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" now that I've seen them put their fingers to their noses to this one.  I can't blame them that they were disappointed watching this with me.<br /><br />And one more thing; CGI is really killing the appeal of movie these days.  It's like watching cartoons being put in the movie and we're suppose to take it seriously? The old-fashion visual effects and the lack of CGI is probably the reason why the original "Star Wars" trilogy was more visually believable and entertaining than the over-saturated CGI effects of the "Star Wars" prequel.<br /><br />Does anyone else agree?</p></body></html>

I obviously have no way of understanding the responsibilities associated with ruling a country, but--at the risk of stating the obvious--I can imagine that it isn't easy. Every decision, action, and idea that's made will meet with praise and/or criticism on a global scale. Options must be weighed for the benefit of her people, not for the benefit of herself or her family. She must be willing to be scrutinized and ridiculed by the media, who legally have the right to attack her character, disagree with her policies, and mock her in general. These issues are skillfully examined in this film. However, I'm hard pressed to say that it's an accurate examination. Likewise, some viewers may be turned off by its consistently dry tone.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there's a lot about this film to enjoy, not the least of which is Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen; here's a woman that was raised to believe that the needs of her country outweigh her own needs. While she's diligent and professional when it comes to governmental affairs, her emotions are kept under lock and key. This proved to be troublesome in August of 1997, when Diana, Princess of Wales, died in Paris in an automobile accident. The Queen's immediate reaction is deciding to keep the Royal Family out of the public eye. Part of this decision had to do with Diana's children, who needed to grieve without the press hassling them. The rest had to do with the Queen's disapproval of Diana; she saw her as nothing more than a publicity hound. Furthermore, Diana was technically no longer a member of the Royal Family (she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier). Because of that, it seemed proper to respect the wishes of the Spencer family to have a private funeral.<br /><br />This does not sit well with the British population, who generally loved Diana for her humanitarianism. Public opinion soon turns against the Queen. At the same time, the popularity ratings for the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), are rising; he's been much more public about Diana's tragic death. A majority of the film focuses on his working relationship with the Queen, specifically in trying to get her to cooperate and listen to her people. They want her to make a statement. They want her to raise the flag over Buckingham Palace at half-mast. They want her to acknowledge the throngs of Diana supporters that are leaving bouquets at the Palace gates. She refuses to take part in the media frenzy. In her mind, Diana's death is a private matter; the public will simply have to accept that.<br /><br />It's soon decided that Diana's funeral will, in fact, be a public affair. True, the Queen finds this highly improper. However, she also begins to understand the British people will not let this one go; they want Diana to have a proper funeral, and the want their Queen to show some degree of compassion. The pressure they put on her is increasing, so much so that long buried emotions begin to resurface. Example: while walking through a remote countryside, she cries for the first time. It's obvious that years of royal etiquette have had an impact; despite the fact that she's alone and surrounded by acres of open land, her sobs are forcefully restrained. In that moment, her only comfort is a wild buck that passes by; it's large, majestic, and clearly symbolic of strength and fortitude.<br /><br />At that point, she finally begins taking Blair's advice, much to the chagrin of her husband, Philip (James Cromwell), and her mother (Sylvia Sims). She publicly walks past the piles of bouquets, reading notes written by Diana supporters (one says, "Your blood is on their hands"). She makes a televised statement (albeit a prewritten, mechanical, emotionless one). It all leads up to Diana's funeral, a full media blowout with celebrity attendance, including Luciano Pavarotti, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Elton John (who would score a hit with the new version of "Candle in the Wind"). By the time the funeral ends, the Queen's relationship with Prime Minister Blair has diminished considerably. Their final scene acts as a counterpart to their first, in which they meet: the latter is a light, pleasant moment between the two; the former is tense and reserved.<br /><br />Some might think that the purpose of "The Queen" is to portray Elizabeth II as a cold, uncaring, conservative individual. Indeed, her engrained devotion to duty and honor doesn't make her especially gregarious. However, I don't think the filmmakers were attempting to portray her in any particular fashion, nor do I think they were passing judgment on her; instead, they were presenting her plainly and directly, allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions. Maybe it's best that we do no such thing; very few can appreciate the responsibilities and sacrifices required of a ruler.</p></body></html>

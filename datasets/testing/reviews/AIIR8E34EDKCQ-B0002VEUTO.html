<meta name="summary" content="Too long.."></head><body><p>I'm a girl but I'm still a huge fan of action, fantasy, martial arts and even war movies, but this one almost put me to sleep.<br /><br />I have seen Pitch Black, even though this is a sequel, the story is so intertwined and a bit boring that I didn't care how it ended. I did not feel any real interest in it, no connection!<br /><br />I felt like my eyes were gliding over pictures on the screen, and not much was absorbed, my eyes weren't hungry for this movie at all.<br /><br />The main character is a cool guy, and he kicks ass nicely, but other than that, I felt like I lost over 2 hours of my life on this CG movie.<br /><br />Most of the background was done on the computer, and it had a cheap feeling/look to it.<br /><br />One thing I liked was the costumes, the Necromongers had this great medieval/meets new age warrior stuff on, and it certainly saved this from being a totally horrible experience.<br /><br />Really, the simple fact of writing a review of this is putting me to sleep. It's a bit of a dozer.....</p></body></html>

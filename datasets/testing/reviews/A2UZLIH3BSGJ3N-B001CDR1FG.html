<meta name="summary" content="The Hulk was a Hulk of a Disapointment"></head><body><p>I can remember watching the Hulk t.v series when I was much younger,always anxious to see the "green monster" and for the man who you did'nt want to see "get angry".However,the theatrical version&interpitation of Stan Lee's comic book did not translate well to the screen.<br /><br /> The Hulk has what seems to be a very mechanical&formulated script and screenplay.No matter that ILM did all the cgi work,it just goes to proove that a movie with an endless budget can still suck.This film was a huge dissapointment.I was really anticipatiing it to be interesting&well done because I was so surprised by Spidereman.<br /><br /> Well,all the amped up advertisements,trailers&teasers could'nt keep this film afloat.I'm not opposed to the casting,but the push to get the film made,made for a bad script.Eric Banna is a fantastic actor and one of my new Aussie favorites.If you want to see him at his best,I highly reccomend "Chopper".I watched that film while romping around in Australia a few years back&it is really something to see.<br /><br /> All the digital work was dull&have seen much of it before,and "the Hulk" moved unrealistically in many scenes,bending the usual flexibility given to science fiction and fantasty to it's breaking point.He looked like a well painted&detailed cartoon,just like most of ILM's digital character animations.CGI in my opinion is overused in films now-a-days,and it has'nt improved any in the last few years.Very few films have been able to make it work&pull it off,and the only one that comes to mind where it did work&work well,was the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br /><br /> All in all,this film moves along at a "Hulk's pace"(pardon the pun).It is very slow,and borring...the story is hardly interesting enough to keep your attention.In the end,it is just an FX fest,and that is what makes it so difficult to watch&keep your interest.I love good sci-fi&special effects that make you go,"WOW" but those are few&far between.<br /><br /> Hollywood is far more interested in making the almighty dollar,and they don't care what kind of product the turn out.Every year a new "Block Buster" crapper of a movie promised to be the next Ben Hur is released.I for one would rather watch a low budget film with a fantastc story&characters,with little known actors than waste my money&time on a big budget piece of S#@!?*&#^*$!,which in this case,is exactly what you get.</p></body></html>

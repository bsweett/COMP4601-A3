<meta name="summary" content="Wow a sequel that out does the first"></head><body><p>Spiderman 2 I think is the best movie based on a comic that I've seen. It's one of the best sequels ever made as well.  The script is very well done with a ton of character build-up. Peter Parker loses his web slinging abilities and has to figure out how to get them back or maybe he doesn't even want them back. Him being too busy fighting crime is losing him jobs and also  Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)  the women he loves. Fearing that she'd get hurt if she was part of his life is keeping him from letting her in. So she gives up on waiting for Peter and starts dating a hot shot astronaut. Harry Osborne  (James Franco), still blames Spidey for the death of his father and swears that he will get revenge. He's so obsessed with it that it's ruining his friendship with Peter. Since he thinks Peter knows who Spiderman is and is mad that he won't tell him. <p>  Harry's also using a brilliant scientist in Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina) to try and invent something huge to get his father's business running once again. The invention fails and leaves Doctor Octavius with metal tentacles stuck to his spine. He's not a bad man but with the chip broken that let him control the tentacles, they now control him. He wants to continue his project but needs Harry's help but first Harry wants him to capture Spiderman for him. <p>  The result is a well put together movie full of so much that it feels like 3 hours and not just 2 hours and 7 minutes. There's a lot of dialogue and it can be slow but the action scenes are off the chart when there is action. It focuses more on the character Spiderman and the people in his life. May sound boring but when it all comes together at the end it's very satisfying. Plus it's more romantic than the first and Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have even better chemestry this time around. Spiderman 2 is no doubt the best movie of the summer and I doubt anything coming out can compare to it.</p></body></html>

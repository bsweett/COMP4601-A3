Plain and simple."></head><body><p>You hear the phrase "daring film-making" tossed around like a beach ball these days; someone kills off a main character, it's "daring" and "original" and should be nominated for 20 Oscars.  If you want to know what "daring film-making" really is, stick around 'til the end of "No Country For Old Men."  Not that you'll have much trouble--you'll be glued to your seat the entire time.  Probably shaking in terror and anticipation.<br /><br />Here's the premise, and I'll sum it up quickly: a man finds a satchel containing 2 million dollars and then hits the road, persued by a psycopathic hitman and a haven't-seen-it-all-yet-apparently sheriff.  If that summary of the plot doesn't suit your purposes, then just go see the movie.  It's not about plot anyways.  The plot is good, the plot is interesting and great...but it's not about plot.<br /><br />It's about acting.  It's about cinemetography.  It's about script.  It's about Josh Brolin putting you on edge and yet getting your sympathy vote; it's about Tommy Lee Jones giving the performance of his career; it's about Javier Bardem creeping you the [bleep] out.  Hell, even Woody Harrelson, in his too-brief role, proves he's more than a funny man.  The main star is, of course, Texas--beautiful, rugged, majestic, and eerily terrifying.  The dialogue is brisk when it needs to be, thoughtful when it's called for, and always engaging.  There are two scenes that rank as the most suspensful I've ever seen: the scene where Brolin's character is sitting in the dark of his hotel room, waiting for Bardem's character to make his move; and the scene where Jones's character enters the hotel room near the end.  Both scenes left me shaking in my seat, sweating, scared and rivetted.  I don't think that's ever happened before--at least not twice in one movie.<br /><br />A word on the ending.  I went to see this with a buddy of mine.  On our way home from the theater, we talked about nothing but the ending of the movie (eventually we got around to "Cheers" and began bashing Ted Danson and praising Danny de Vito, but that's neither here nor there).  The plain and simple fact is, it works.  I mentioned "daring film-making" at the beginning of this review.  To me, "daring" is when a film-maker stays true to the movie, to what needs to be done for the sake of art.  The Coen Brothers, more than anybody else out there, do that; and they have never done it better than with "No Country For Old Men."  So casual viewers beware: you may leave the movie feeling unfulfilled, like something is missing.  And you will probably have nightmares afterwards.  But that just goes to show how effective "No Country For Old Men" is.  It's a classic.  See it, and you'll understand my reasoning.  Or don't see it and miss out on a truly original cinema experience.</p></body></html>

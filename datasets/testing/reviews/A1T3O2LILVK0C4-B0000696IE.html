It gives insight into the director's life experiences and his childhood in particular. For the most part the film is shown through the eyes of a child. It captures a certain sense of innocence and wonderment that was rare in films of the early 1980s. It's also startlingly honest in its portrayal of children growing up in contemporary America. Rarely do films give a truthful account of what the social behavior of children is really like. These children playfully torment one another, they swear and most importantly they aren't always good to each other. As a child, I recognized this and I still find it intriguing that one of the most accurate views of childhood should be found within a science fiction film. No wonder the story still touches people today.<br /><br />The story concerns an alien (who happens to be a botanist) that is stranded on Earth. Government agents pursue him so he retreats into the vast forests of Northern California. One night a ten-year-old boy named Elliott sees him. Soon the two become friends and a symbiotic bond is formed. E.T., as the alien is dubbed, comes from a distant planet where his species experience reality through a collective conscious. Without his species he cannot emote, maintain physical health and therefore his life is endangered. But miraculously a link is formed between E.T. and Elliott, and this keeps him alive. E.T. feels Elliott's pain and distress, both emotional and physical, and responds to it. Now Elliott shares E.T.'s emotions, which further complicates his life. In one memorable sequence, E.T. discovers beer and becomes drunk causing Elliott to act in an intoxicated manner while at school. Soon the link between them strengthens and neither of them can sustain themselves. In order for either of them to survive E.T. must be reunited with his own species. All during this time the only other people to have seen E.T. are Elliott's siblings and a mysterious man who is only known as Keys. Elliott must learn to rely on his older brother, Michael and his younger sister, Gertie to keep his secret. On Halloween night, they manage to sneak E.T. out of the house, and Elliott and E.T. embark on an amazing journey through the forest. Deep within the forest, E.T. constructs a communication device out of mundane household items and attempts to contact the other aliens. When Elliott wakes up the following morning E.T. has vanished. Elliott returns home to find his mother panicked about his disappearance. His older brother, Michael searches for E.T. and finds him, half dead in the river and proceeds to bring him back home. Only then do the children reveal E.T.'s presence to their mother. But before she can absorb the shock government agents, dressed in space suits and armed with guns, break into their home. Meanwhile E.T. and Elliott grow weaker. And the only hope for their mutual survival is for E.T. to return to his home planet.<br /><br />The film is something of an emotional roller coaster ride and its climactic bicycle chase is breathtaking. By the time the end credits have started you'll either have tears in your eyes or you'll be too exhausted to absorb the film's impact.<br />Much has already been said about the film's artistic and technical merits, so I won't go into great detail about the brilliance of the acting, the production design, John William's wonderful score, Melissa Mathison's script or Spielberg's direction. But I will say that they all deserve credit for this wonderful film. E.T. is truly a modern classic!<br /><br />* The original 1982 widescreen theatrical version of E.T. isn't easy to find. It's only available in two expensive sets, both of which I recommend. Currently both of those DVD editions are unavailable here on Amazon.com, but they can be found in some novelty and collector shops. Hopefully when Universal releases this title in the future they'll include the original version as well as the 20th Anniversary edition.</p></body></html>

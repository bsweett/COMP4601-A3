<meta name="summary" content="Great performances cannot rescue needlessly long film."></head><body><p>The biggest problem with this film is the script;it needs to be trimmed severely.Two hours of plodding disappointment and "bad luck" for about two minutes of happiness does not make for the most effective viewing.Much of the hardship could have been compressed and the point would have still been made effectively.Will Smith's performance of(inspired by a true story) Chris Gardner is truly outstanding and the film is worth a see just for that alone;but overall the film has a drone about it that stays stuck in a downward spiral just like it's lead character.DOOR TO DOOR with William H.Macy is a better treatment of a similar subject.</p></body></html>

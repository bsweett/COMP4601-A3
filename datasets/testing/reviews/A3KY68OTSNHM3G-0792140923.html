<meta name="summary" content="The Story of a Lifetime"></head><body><p>Once in a great while, a movie comes along that captures your heart and imagination.  Forrest Gump is one of those rare movies.  Led by an all-star cast including Tom Hanks (Forrest), Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan), and Sally Field (Mrs. Gump), the viewer is treated to a view of Americana through the eyes of a simple young country boy.<br /><br />Through three turbulent decades, the movie describes events that were capturing headlines throughout the United States, as told through Forrest's eyes.  The viewer gets a unique look at such events as racial segregation, physical disability, war protests, and the onset of AIDS.  Through Forrest's unique perspective, the viewer is shown each of these controversial topics.<br /><br />The viewer also gets to see the ups and downs of Forrest's relationship with Jenny over the years.  From young children riding a school bus together to facing the uncertainty of AIDS, a lifelong bond is shared between them. Although leading very different lives, Forrest's love for Jenny never waivers, and in the end, Jenny finally realizes that she is ment to be with Forrest.<br /><br />The scenes in Vietnam are some of my favorites.  Gary Sinese's portrayal of Lt. Dan Taylor is simply perfect.  A by-the-book soldier who teaches Forrest how to stay alive, it is ultimately Forrest who saves Lt. Dan's life (over his protests) during an enemy ambush.  Forced to have both legs amputated, Lt. Dan slips into a life of alcohol and self-doubt, but Forrest remains his true friend, and after buying a shrimping boat, Lt. Dan joins Forrest as his "first mate".  It is here that Lt. Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life.<br /><br />The most touching scene of the movie is near the end where Forrest is speaking to Jenny at her gravesite.  Forrest tells Jenny how much he loves and misses her, all the while gently crying.  He also explains to her how proud he is of their son Forrest Jr.  In the end, Forrest and Forrest Jr. are waiting for the school bus, just like Forrest and his mother used to.<br /><br />I would give this movie six stars if I could.  Tom Hanks won an academy award for his portrayal of Forrest, while Robert Zemeckis also won for best director.  Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The acting is impeccable, and the viewer gets an interesting history lesson about life in the United States during the 60s, 70s, and early 80s.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  I guarantee that you won't have a dry eye after watching it.</p></body></html>

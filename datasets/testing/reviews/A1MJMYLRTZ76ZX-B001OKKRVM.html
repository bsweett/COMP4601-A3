I knew Antartica was a cold, harsh place, but I didn't know temperatures got down to 80 degrees below zero, with 125 mile an hour winds. That's a combined chill factor of about 200 degrees below zero, if I remember right. But somehow the penguins manage to survive here.<br /><br />The cinematography is spectacular, and one wonders how long the camera man had to wait to get some of these amazing shots, which include footage of baby chicks hatching out of their eggs, footage of the penguins swimming under the ice in the freezing water, a seabird landing near the flock and trying to kill a baby penguin, and a sea lion grabbing a penguin out of the water, and a despondent mother penguin who had lost her chick who tries to steal another mother's chick. (The other penguins intervened and refused to allow the mother to take the chic.)<br /><br />Unlike on land, the penguins are very graceful in the water and the swimming flock looks like an underwater ballet. The penguins can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes and can dive 1700 feet--far enough to reach the ocean bottom under Antartica in some places. Pinipeds or seals can also dive thousands of feet, and sperm whales are known to be able to dive a mile deep, but I didn't know penguins were capable of such feats. By contrast, a human diver unaided can only go down about 40 feet, and with an aqualung can go down about 150 feet, but that requires a different gas mix, from what I've read. Most divers never go below 90 feet.<br /><br />The DVD also contains special features such as a shorter documentary on how the expedition was mounted, planned, and filmed, and you get to meet the people who created this amazing film. One funny thing is that the special features section of the DVD includes a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled "8-Ball Bunny," in which Bugs tries to return a little lost penguin to his home. The actual documentary is about 90 minutes long. I can't recall the composer who did the soundtrack, but it was good and adds to the overall ambience. In addition to this being a visually stunning and dangerous film to make, you'll also learn a lot about Antarctica and the life of the emperor penguin.</p></body></html>

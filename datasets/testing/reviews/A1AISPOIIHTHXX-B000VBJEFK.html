<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite films of 2007"></head><body><p>Despite the fact that they have 5 films under their belt, I always felt the Pixar films directed by Brad Bird were some of the best that came out of the studio. Not that he does anything completely left of center but they somehow feel different in spirit than the studio's regular output with the "Incredibles" being my favorite film they've done. Now comes "Ratatouille", Bird's follow-up to that superhero movie and Pixar's followup to the uncharacteristically-average "Cars". Since that film wasn't that well received, Ratatouille didn't look promising either until it became, deservingly, one of the best-reviewed films of the year.<br /><br />Remy is a rat living in the French countryside with his family living off of garbage. But with a gift for smell and taste, Remy has more higher standards for the kind of food he eats. But when he's seperated from his family and finds himself under Paris' restaurant, Gusteau's, home of Remy's idol and with the motto "anyone can cook!", Remy feels right at home. That is of course if people can accept a rat in the kitchen, much less cooking their food. But with the help of socially inept and cooking-challenged Linguini, Remy and Linguini become friends and kitchen stars which attracts the attention of ambitious chef Skinner and harsh food critic Anton Ego.<br /><br />Whereas the Incredibles was more action-packed than any other Pixar outing, Ratatouille almost has a more romantic comedy/buddy movie feel and it feels more unique than A Bug's Life or Finding Nemo. There isn't that one obvious comic relief character and the film doesn't end in a glorious action sequence so while the kids might find it too character-driven, adults might find it more delightful that the film speaks to the audience and not down at them with bad puns and pop culture references. From colorful characters and a lighthearted but not saccharine tone, the film seems quite at home with anyone.<br /><br />It's kind of a cliche now to point out Pixar has become the best in computer animation. Whereas Dreamworks and the folks behind Robots and Ice Age do have impressive animation, at times there's things such as texture or subtleties that make them far behind. And it's fair to say Ratatouille is probably their most accomplished and it's all to do with character animation and nuances. Sure there's things like the slightly translucent flesh tone that the rat's ear has to the differences between wet fur, dry fur and whatnot but the characters feel more realistic. One of my favorite parts is when a character is about to slap another but stops and it's just as good an acting job as live-action. Then of course there's the food. Don't watch on an empty stomach.<br /><br />If there's one knock, it's the special features. While they have double-dipped in the past, Monsters Inc. to the Incredibles were always filled with featurettes and documentaries about the making-of. But since Cars, the films seem light on anything. Sure we get the funny short "Lifted", a new short and whatnot but it's not as packed as I would like it to be. There's not even a commentary and as anyone who's heard Bird talk, he's a very...animated fellow (no pun intended) and to hear him talk about the film would've been welcome.<br /><br />It might not have the wide-reaching appeal Toy Story has but for anyone looking for a great animated film, can't go wrong with this one.</p></body></html>

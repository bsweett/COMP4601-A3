I recently rented it and was greatly disappointed.  This movie deals with a virus that makes people almost like mutant crazies that go around attacking other people.  <p>A group of people wander London trying to get back to &quot;civilization.&quot;  While the characters in George Romero's classic were interesting and you really felt for them, these characters are dull and sometimes act crazy themselves.<p>The British accents were very difficult to understand at times.  The climatic ending is in no way as good as Romero's film.  In this film the survivors of the group keep trying to catch the attention of some overflying aircraft.  They rig a big message and I guess they are rescued because the next scene is says it is 28 days later and the main character is in a hospital.  Not worth buying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rock me Amadeus on Blu Ray!!!"></head><body><p>This is one heck of a Blu Ray release!!! This is the best this film has ever looked on home video,It's very nice as it includes all of the content of the 2-DVD Set release of the Diretor's Cut(the same documentary and commentary now on one Blu Ray disc instaed of 2 DVD's) and much more,the much more meaning a nice 30 page book packaging,a companion CD,and a digital copy of the movie,a stellar release from Warner Bros! Very recommended for fans of the Oscar winning film! A+</p></body></html>

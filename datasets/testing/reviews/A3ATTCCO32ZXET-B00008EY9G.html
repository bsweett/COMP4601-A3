<meta name="summary" content="Great thriller set in the famous dark and stormy night"></head><body><p>This is so reminding me of Brian DePalma (I remember commenting the first ten minutes into Identity).  There is no doubt that director James Mangold is drawing heavily on a DePalma influence, or perhaps tapping into a Hitchcock vein.  Whatever the case, this thriller is just the fix I've been after without even realizing it.<p>I admit to being partial to the cast.  John Cusack (Ed the limo driver with a past) is an actor I will go out of my way to see any time; needless to say, he is brilliant here too.  Amanda Peet, playing a hooker trying to turn her life around, brings her trademark tough smarts to the role and does a great job as always.  Ray Liotta plays his usual sinister-guy-posing-as-normal character, but here it fits nicely.  Rebecca DeMornay's washed-up TV star part is brief enough to nearly qualify as a cameo, but memorable.  The rest of the crew complement this roundup as the assorted bunch that arrive together at the isolated motel on that fateful stormy night that a murderous evil runs amok somewhere outside - or is it inside?<p>Never fear, this is no mere slasher flick. This *is* a deliciously creepy Whodunit with an added slice of suspense. It is also a real psychological thriller in the old school sense.  In true Hitchcockian tradition there is an underlying plot that manages to bring together the seemingly random people and events that clash so chaotically. The little clues that are dropped here and there are just intriguing enough to give us a taste for the twist that we just know is coming (why is there blood on the back of Ray's shirt just before he covers it up with his jacket?  What's up with the Indian tombs outside?)  Naturally, there is also a false lead or two.  By the time the real killer is revealed we can click those puzzles pieces together with great satisfaction and wonder at how we didn't see the big picture all along.<p>If I had to compare Identity to another recent film, I would say Memento is the closest in style and quality.  In any event, I'd recommend Identity to anybody who enjoys this classic thriller subgenre.<p>-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

Hellboy returns in Guillermo del Toro's sequel facing his most daunting task yet--he has to prevent Elf Prince Nuada(Luke Goss)from awakening the Golden Army--mechanical warriors his father had created before the peace with humanity. It seems that Nuada feels its time to take down the human race but to control the Golden Army he needs to retrieve the three sections of a special crown one which his father has, another section was given to humanity while the last piece belongs to his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) who is against her brother's decision to go to war. As with the first movie Hellboy (Ron Perlman)and his team mates Liz (Selma Blair), Abe Sapiens (Doug Jones who does the voice for Abe in this film)and new team leader Dr. Krauss (voiced by Seth MacFarlane of "Family Guy" fame)find themselves unappreciated by the humans they try and save.<br /><br />The latest film from del Toro like all of his films has a distinctive look and feel to it unlike films by other directors. Written by del Toro (from a story by del Toro and Hellboy creator Mike Mignola), the second film has a much larger scope with some truly stunning and funny scenes including the scene where Hellboy must face Wink a giant with a metal hand in the Troll Market and the stunning conclusion which relies largely on CGI.<br /><br />The DVD comes packed with a lot of extras. We get a commentary track from del Toro on the first disc, a tour of the Troll Market with del Toro as well as a feature length documentary on the production of the film included on the second disc. There are also deleted scenes and an animated comic book included as part of the package.<br /><br />The DVD looks extremely good with bright vivid colors and a nice, sharp looking transfer. What really makes this shine,though, are the special features where del Toro lets you see everything from his "Director's Notebook" to production sketches prepared for the film. Fans can also read the original script and print it up if they have access to a DVD-Rom drive.<br /><br />"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" might not have had the critical acclaim of "Batman: The Dark Knight" but it has its own distinctive look and is equally as entertaining without the "dark" baggage of Chris Nolan's terrific film. This is a terrifically entertaining film with loads of extras and I'm recommend it to fans of the first film as well as those who haven't stepped into Hellboy's world (although I'd recommend the first film before watching this but it isn't a prerequisite).</p></body></html>

No, you haven't been ambushed, sprayed by helicopter gunships bearing the gift of Better Living through Chemical Weapons, manhandled and hauled off to a super-duper-secret Gulf island laboratory/torture-center, and jacked up with implants.<br /><br />It's not the implants talking, Soldier---not now. This movie is a Cheese Sandwich.<br /><br />I mean that, quite simply: it's competently put together, nothing special, and does its job. And in an hour, not only won't you remember the Cheese Sandwich, but you'll be hungry all over again.<br /><br />Pretty dismal that with all that talent on-board (Denzel Washington, Jon Voight, Miguel Ferrer), a big sleek Hollywood budget, and one-time uber-director Jon Demme at the helm---with all that, the best Demme could do is a Cheese Sandwich?<br /><br />This time Commies are out, Corporate America is in, because we all know there's nothing more terrifying than a Private Equity firm (Manchurian Global) teeming with blue-pinstripe-suited bankers poring over their Wall Street Journal and checking their stocks while plotting global perfidy. Right? And also, because Commie China would never try to brainwash a U.S. President.<br /><br />Nope. Nosirree.<br /><br />I'm not a stickler for logic with either movie, though the remake is a little murkier: I can see why the nefarious Russians & Chi-Coms would brainwash Raymond Shaw---their automaton gets fingered, they have total deniability (and fairly hard-to-get at zip codes).<br /><br />But let's put ourselves in the cushy leather boardroom chairs at Manchurian Global, Remake Territory. Run it by me one more time why Managing Director Carstairs (ya know, the guy down the hall in Accounting) and I should put everything on the line---our careers, manor homes, Bentleys, family, fortune, freedom---to do this little Black Ops job on Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) and company.<br /><br />I mean, you take all that risk, and for what? At the end of the day we get a U.S. President you can flip on and off like a light switch---and who can double as a stone-cold killer on those days when you need an assassination done and the CIA isn't checking its voice mail?<br /><br />Ummm, I think not. You want your man in the White House? There's an easier way: it's called campaign contributions.<br /><br />Anyway, Demme's remake isn't a bad movie, nor, as some claim, is it a politically offensive movie. It's too unsure of itself, and ultimately far too bland, to be edgy enough to offend.<br /><br />It's stylish, sleek, techno, suitably paranoid and edgy. It's got Denzel Washington totally owning the Ben Marco role and making it his own, right down to grinding teeth and bulging, terrified eyes. It's got Liev Schreiber, who starts out as a creepy nutball and ends up as a creepy nutball & hot political commodity! See, brainwashing ain't so bad!<br /><br />You get a funky Wyclef Jean rendering of John Fogerty's old protest song "Fortunate Son", which gives the remake some wry, cynical street creds early on and sets up the mood. You get Miguel Ferrer and Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill from Demme's "Silence of the Lambs")---don't blink or you'll miss 'em. You get seriously, skin-crawlingly creepy Arab women wandering around showing off their insanely bad henna jobs. You get about an hour of taut, paranoid nastiness that had me thinking I was going to get a conspiratorial feast instead of---well, instead of cheese, bread, and a little mayo.<br /><br />Oh, you also get an appetizer of John Voight, who, after "Anaconda", should know to stay far away from the water. You get Meryl Streep confusing loud shouting for acting, yet again.<br /><br />But in the end, this is an amazingly stupid, sadly generic flick that will exit your mind, never to return, as soon as the credits roll. Think about it this way: you manage to dig an electronic implant out of your back, proof, finally, that there's something to these night terrors after all.<br /><br />Then you fumble the little gewgad, and it flies out of your slippery hands and down the drain.<br /><br />Now, stay with me here, Soldier---you're telling me that you---an Army Major, a combat vet, obsessed with getting a shred of evidence that those filthy corporate McNasties are running you like a little flesh-&-blood Rayovac---you're telling me you don't know you can remove the sink drainpipe to retrieve the damned thing?<br /><br />Terminate with Extreme Prejudice. Or better still, just avoid.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Inspired and exciting superhero film!"></head><body><p>In the superhero genre, this film scores a 4!<p>Sean Connery, Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend, Richard Roxburgh, and Jason Flemyng almost jump out of the screen as some of literature's greatest heros (or villains depending on your take).  Based on a graphic novel of the same name, the film provides us with an introduction to each character as any good superhero film should and then WHAM! we're in the action!<p>Don't make the mistake that many might - that this is an action film - because, while it has tons of action, this is a superhero film!  Back before there were comics, there were fantasy novels, science fiction, and horror.  It is this genre that this movie (and since I've not read the graphic novel - I'll assume it as well) mines for its characters and plotline.<p>The time is 1899, and some meglomaniac is attempting to bring the world into a world war (remember the first world war began some 13 years later).  So the head of British Intelligence attempts to sign on Allen Quartermaine, the great explorer and adventurer as the leader of a group known as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The man who brings them together is known as "M".  (Now, this mere character name flashed brightly for me as it alluded to the current cinematic version of the British Secret Service overseeing James Bond - M.  Now, kids, anyone remember who played the first James Bond? - Can you say Sean Connery?).  I don't know how faithful this occurrance is to the books, but, man, it struck just the right note for me.<p>Hesitant, Quartermaine agrees and we are quickly introduced to the rest of the League (and does this "League" name strike anyone as vaguely familiar to the "Justice League" of comic book fame?):  we have Stevenson's invisible man, Mina Harker from Stoker's Dracula, Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Well's Captain Nemo (really outstandingly fleshed out for us here), Wilde's Dorian Gray, Twain's Tom Sawyer are brought to life for us vividly.  The streets of London are brought to life wonderfully.<p>I loved how the science fiction aspect was developed:  Captain Nemo is obviously a scientific genius and so he has advanced modern science on his own by creating an automobile (which were actually invented in around 1875 by Daimler Benz in Germany, but were not yet known widely) that looks like it belongs in the 1930's and a submarine which looks as if it is the size of the Titanic.  He also has heat seeking missiles on board the Nautilus.  This is all quite fantastic and farfetched - but HEY! - this is an action film of the superhero nature.<p>Why these characters?  Quartermaine is undeniably the first "Indiana Jones" of literature.  Mina Harker is a brilliant choice, because she is a vampire - who can fly and transform herself - but one who can walk in the daylight. The Invisible Man is stealthy and ....invisible!  Dorian Gray - well he's indestructible - but he does have his Kryptonite.  Captain Nemo...well there's got to be a superhero who knows everything about everything, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde...well let me tell you that Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about "The Hulk" in the late 1800's - long before Stan Lee borrowed the concept for his comic.  Tom Sawyer?  He's the American version of Quartermaine and a crack shot.<p>The acting is top notch and the storyline is really quite well developed.  I want to read the books, because I've got to believe Fox was somewhat faithful to them, because movie studios routinely screw up good literary stories when they put them to film.<p>The special effects are awesome and the storyline really works.  I really loved who the villain turns out to be.  I'm not going to tell you, but do remember the characters are all from Victorian literature.<p>Definitely go see this movie!  I fully intend to purchase this when it hits DVD.  Loved it!</p></body></html>

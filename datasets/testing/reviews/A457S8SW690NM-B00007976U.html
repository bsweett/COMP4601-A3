<meta name="summary" content="a very solid thriller"></head><body><p>So Robin Williams can also be in thrillers, I now know that for sure. He was terrifying in this highly realistic and believable thriller. But, you can sympathize also with the vilain and the crazy person. Robin Williams plays a man that develops film for a living. While doing this, the person that watches this movie realizes that the developpers can know EVERYTHING about you. This made me feel uncomftorbable at times because even though I already knew this, I just never really had thought about it. But, William's character then becomes obsessed with one family and makes copies of all of their film and puts in on his walls. When you first see this, it's very disturbing.<br /><br />But, he still loves this family and dreams of being part of the family. He's always very nice to them but when one of the members of the family is "insincere" and has a secret that only William's character knows about while developping film, he goes absolutely insane. But, even after what he does, which I won't give away, you still sympathize with his character, feeling very sorry for him. You actually at a lot of moments disslike the member of the family that has commited this "bad deed" way more than you do Robin William's character. This vilain is very different and unlike most vilains which you hate, you sympathize with him and feel very sorry for this lonely person that has been driven to insanity. William's performance is absolutely brilliant.</p></body></html>

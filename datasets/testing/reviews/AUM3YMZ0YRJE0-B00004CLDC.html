While it makes much of the violence seem funny and natural, the overall impact of the film is to show how empty and dangerous the mob life really was.  I have watched this at least 15 times, and have enjoyed it every single time as more detail comes through.  The characters are extremely subtle and the acting is absolutely first rate.  You get a historical snapshop of organizaed crime as well as a cautionary tale:  the dreamlike quality of "the life" gives way to the ugliest of realities.  While certain of the characters are composites, such as Tommy, the story is essentially true.</p></body></html>

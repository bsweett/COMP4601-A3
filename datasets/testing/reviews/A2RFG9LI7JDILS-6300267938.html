The details of the film are extraordinary, and you can see why Orson Welles was so enthralled by the man and his movies.<br /><br />John Wayne is very aptly cast in this - probably his best film.<br /><br />What grabs me the most is the epic style of the photography - the play of light and color - which must have been so exciting to see when the film came out.<br /><br />My perspective as a viewer in 2005 is what brings this one down to 4 stars for me (a personal decision). Although I see this film as a classic, even a masterpiece, I just cannot bare some of the racism that comes out at times.. I try to filter out this aspect - I mean all film is a product of its time and place - but my own personal perspective is very hard to shake. This does not take away from the very obvious brilliance that I do see in this film, however, and the genius of John Ford does shine through.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the better of the two films from Grindhouse, though not spectacular"></head><body><p>I just waited for this one to come out to video, I would have hated to see what the abreviated version in the theater was like.  But, as expected, didn't care for this movie much.  Although compaired to death proof, it was an acadamy award winning film.  First off, its a take off of an old B rate movie, the simulated poor film quality and editing.  With all the movie technology and graphics and film options, I don't want to see and old choppy/scratchy film.  If I wanted that, I'll rent attack of the Killer tomatos, or planet of the apes, something classic, not simulated.  Second off, Its a zombie movie, what the heck.  Nothing fancier than a B rate zombie movie.  I guess there must be a market for this Artsy stuff, or the film wouldn't have been made.  I guess I am to sober of a person to "catch the buzz" about this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHY IT HAD TO BE LOW BUDGET!!!!???? WHY!!!!!!??????"></head><body><p>This movie had the chance of being perfect but they WASTE IT!!!!!<br /><br />I only gave it 3 stars because is an anime tribute, is action-packed and the action scenes were SOO COOOOL!!! (best action scenes since Equilibrium) BUT:<br /><br />* CG animation and special effects were SOO CHEAP!!!<br /><br />* The destructions and gun fightings looked SOO FAKE!!!!<br /><br />* The movie itself is SOO LIGHTY that you can hardly see it.<br /><br />* The settings, cars and stufs of the movie are pure CG graphics and they were VERY UNREALISTIC.<br /><br />Ultraviolet could have been the next Matrix or something if only had a better quality.<br /><br />P.S: I saw Guyver 2 (low budget anime tribute movie) and it was MUCH BETTER than this one.<br /><br />Adios.</p></body></html>

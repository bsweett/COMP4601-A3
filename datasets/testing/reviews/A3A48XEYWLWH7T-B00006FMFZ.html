<meta name="summary" content="Emotionally barren"></head><body><p>Emotionally distant, this film's major characters didn't endear themselves in any way.  Even the ostensibly sympathetic characters are blank and unlikable.  Granted, we're dealing with gangsters and their immediate hirelings and bodyguards, but unlike, say, the Godfather saga, there was no one really compelling.  Hanks is a beloved husband, and hit-man, an amusing stretch I know.  He works for Irish mobster boss Paul Newman, Hanks' 12 year old boy sees a gangland hit he shouldn't forcing the two on the road after the murder of the rest of Hanks' family.  Hanks then wreaks revenge, seeking the death of Newman and his [Newman's] son who did it.  A pale version of the Japanese manga Lone Wolf and Cub, the story follows to its inexorable conclusion, especially factoring in a creepily balding Jude Law as the assassin hired to track down Hanks and terminate him.  There were some nice cinematic touches like the Tommy gun flashing out of the shadows during Hanks and Newman's final showdown in the rain.  Hanks trades in bland hero for bland bad guy and the story never really connects.</p></body></html>

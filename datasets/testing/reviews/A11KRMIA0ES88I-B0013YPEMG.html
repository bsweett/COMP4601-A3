<meta name="summary" content="Batman"></head><body><p>I thought, "Why would anyone do Batman in 1989?" It turned out to be a strong, dark movie. Kim Basinger is Batman's girl friend. Jack Nicholson is the Joker. Roger Ebert felt that Batman is mostly form with little substance. He felt that it is rich in atmosphere with very little happening. He was right. In retrospect, it is hard to recall the plot. Comic book movies have certainly had their day. I had trouble with the Batman logo. It looks like some kind of weird boomerang. I realized it is the image of a bat flashed against a cloud cover. Beware of sequels.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alien meets Rambo!!"></head><body><p>Like &quot;Alien&quot; before it this film has a seven crew team that is hunted &amp; eliminated, Arnold is great here as a leader of highly trained special forces unit, that get caught up in all kinds of mishaps (CIA double-crossings,unseen stalker) They are constantly watched by this unseen enemy, Jesse Ventura gives a memorable performance, Sonny Landham (48HRS.) gives a good performance as a tracker who senses the Predator &amp; Carl Weathers gives a good performance as Arnold's advesary, but the best part in this film has to be the showdown between Arnold &amp; the Predator, that starts off like a wresting match, the only movie that has Arnold getting his a** kicked, this was also directed by John McTiernan, a year before &quot;Die Hard&quot; , definately a man's movie, &amp; probably one of Arnold's better movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition) is a strange fantasy movie that centers around a handyman (Paul Giamatti) at Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers who discovers a naiad like creature named Story. The acting is not great and the storyline falters. The movie seems really long even though it only is 110 minutes, it seems much longer. It was universally panned by critics and was nominated for worst movie at the Razzie awards. It is not a 1 star movie but a since I can not give 1 and a half it gets a very weak 2. Not recommended. 2 out of 5.</p></body></html>

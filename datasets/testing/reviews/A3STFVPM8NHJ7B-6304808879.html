<meta name="summary" content="Greatest horror franchise ever"></head><body><p>The greatest true horror movie ever. No horny teenager, who cannot act and no comic relief. This movie grabs you by the throat and doesnt let you go for ninety minutes. The movie is short, but gets to the point and there is rarely any filler. Pinhead is such a great actor, and he has amazing quotes and doesnt try to make the audience laugh. Doug Bradley does any amazing job as Pinhead and his human counterpart. The other movies are excellent, and I enjoy the entire series. Part 3 was probably my faviorte, and I cannot see why people do not like that entry. After Bloodline, it went straight to video but never disappointed me. Pinhead is rarely seen in the last 3 movies, but when he comes on screen, its a treat. Pick up this movie or if you dare, the whole series. Wont be disappointed.</p></body></html>

The characters and sets are imaginative, well thought out and fully realized especially for fantasy animation.  Danny Elfman's songs are hit show tune  hummable as well as having clever lyrics that add depth and move the plot forward.  Everything in the movie is amazingly and completely detailed making the DVD a joy to watch over and over again.  And of course it is hilariously funny.  It is probably not a great choice for the very young or for anyone easily offended by the unique and unusual but NIGHTMARE is a fantastic Halloween (or any time) choice for everyone else.</p></body></html>

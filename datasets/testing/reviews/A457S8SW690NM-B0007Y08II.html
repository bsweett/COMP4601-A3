<meta name="summary" content="I had no idea that puppets cussed SO MUCH..."></head><body><p>Do you know what I don't understand? Why would Amazon say that it's better together to buy this movie with the incredibles? So that parents who might buy it for the great deal accidentally show their small children that loved the incredibles THIS... I mean why wouldn't Amazon offer to package this with stuff like South Park instead?<br /><br />I had mixed feelings after watching this. For one, it wasn't very funny especially not the stupid song: "America F$#% Yeah!" which wasn't funny at all. Of course, it had some funny humor but if made me feel degraded that Americans need to make stuff like this. It criticizes everything in our nation and basically just wasn't very funny. The hot puppet sex scene was very pointless and stupid and not funny at all. I ended turning it off towards the end because of the amount of profanity used by these puppets. If you like South Park which I don't, I'm sure that you'll love this. But myself, being a huge fan of Family Guy, expected this to be funny, but it just wasn't to me. I found myself just staring at the screen while puppets would run around cussing and shooting terrorists. This trully felt like a wasted amount of time while watching this. But, hey, maybe latter on in life, when I'm older, I might appreciate the jokes better. I trully laughed very rarely and struggled a lot of them, but that's just me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Compelling historical drama"></head><body><p>German director Tom Tykwer, of "Run Lola Run" fame, should be commended for his outstanding adaptation of Patrick Suskind's novel "Das Parfum". Tykwer uses a series of authentic looking historical sets and impressive cinematographic close ups and zooms to depict Europe's largest city in the 1700's, Paris.  He uses his camera to convey the sense of aroma in the squalid, unhygienic metropolis which is essential to the plot.<br /><br />Born into the lowest rungs of society and immediately abandoned by his uncaring mother Jean Baptiste Grenouille, the anti-hero of "Perfume", must overcome long odds to survive the pitiful life of an orphan.  The grown up Grenouille played admirably by Ben Whishaw from the onset of life had been endowed with the most highly developed sense of olfaction.  He gets a chance to prove and enhance his gift under the tutelage of once renowned Parisian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini played by a heavily made up Dustin Hoffman.<br /><br />Obsessed with the art of perfuming, Grenouille at the insistence of Baldini treks to the city of Grasse to add to his skills.  A dark side of his personality reveals itself as he maniacally attempts to capture the ultimate scent.  He begins murdering attractive young women, and using the art of effluence uses their hair and bodily oils and scents to create a fragrance from each unfortunate victim.  His murderous actions cause a panic in the town and across the countryside.  Local beauty Laura played by Rachel Hurd-Wood and sheltered by her father played by Alan Rickman becomes Grenouille's ultimate target as the final ingredient in his perfect concoction.<br /><br />The finale was a bit of a stretch but overall the film which was a box office failure, was totally engrossing as the mellifluous tones of narrator John Hurt and the wonderful sets and costumes guide us through a satisfying viewing experience.</p></body></html>

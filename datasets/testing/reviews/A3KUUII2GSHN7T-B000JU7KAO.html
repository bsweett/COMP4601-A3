<meta name="summary" content="Is Shyamalan paying homage to King, Baum and Tolkien?"></head><body><p>I love Shyamalan's work. I adored each film he's put out so far. So when the Lady in the Water's trailer began to show in theatres, I was giddy with delight. But then I saw the film. I enjoyed it, and was entertained, but I found myself wanting more. I was used to getting sucked into his films, and this, although coming close, simply fell short.<br /><br />That being said, I truly believe M. Night is paying homage to three of the greatest fantasy writers of all time in this film: Stephen King, L. Frank Baum (Wizard of Oz), and J.R.R. Tolkien. I deduced this from three sets of characters in the film - we have a lawn wolf that is literally made of grass and hedge (see the monsters from The Shining), we have an evil group of flying monkeys (see Wizard of Oz), and there is also the eagle that represents safety and closure (see the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings).<br /><br />The plots involves a group of apartment dwellers who discover a mysterious women who may possess knowledge that will help heal the world. Of course, there are forces of evil that wish to keep her from doing this, and the neighbors rally around her to ensure her safety.<br /><br />All-in-all, Lady in the Water is an entertaining film with an original plot. The film is doing okay at the box office right now (it's brough in 22 million and cost 55 million) but this is not your typical Shyamalan. Rather, this film appears to be his little pet project, one conjured up from those nights he told this tale to his own children. It's loaded with sentimentality and stands strong on its own merit, but when compared with his other work, ultimately falls short.</p></body></html>

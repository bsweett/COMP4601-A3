<meta name="summary" content="3 1/2 stars for the Evil dead remake!"></head><body><p>Evil Dead 2(released March/87)stars Bruce Campbell,back as Ash in this not so much a sequel film,as a remake(on a much better budget) of the first Evil Dead.<br />This film finds our hero Ash back driving down a country road with his ballerina girlfriend Linda.They come upon the self same deserted cottage as in the first film and decide to stay overnight.In the cabin Ash again discovers a tape recorder(same brand too as in the first)and the Necronomicon.This is how we know this is not a sequel because 1)What would he be doing voluntarily back at the cabin again after what happened the first time around and 2)Ash would KNOW what the tape recorder contains and not play it.But Ash does indeed play it,unleashing the terrible force from the Book of the Dead.His girlfriend is possessed and Ash ends up taking her head off in an adjoining shack with a chainsaw.He buries her out front but becomes possessed by the evil himself,which throws him through the woods.This lasts only until daybreak when he jumps in the car and tears away from the cabin.However,like the first film,the bridge is out and he is going nowhere fast.<br />Thrown into this scenario is the professor(on the tape's)daughter and research partner.They are heading to the cabin but find the bridge out on the other side.A tow truck driver and his girlfriend show up and they accompany them to the cabin.Meanwhile,back at the ranch,Ash has his hands full as the evil has taken over much of the inanimate objects in the cabin and there is a couple of minute sequence where Ash laughs madly along with all the objects.Also,because the head of his girlfriend bit him on the hand,the evil took over that hand and he became forced to sever it,again with the handy-dandy chainsaw.When the outside group finally shows up Ash blasts a hole through the door,thinking it's the spirits.The group ends up subduing him and throwing him in the cellar,thinking he killed the professor and his wife.<br />While in the cellar Ash overhears the group talking about the professors wife and how she became possessed and was also thrown into the cellar.Of course in no time the wife indeed shows up,trying to turn Ash into a deadite.Ash makes it out just in time and finally explains the situation.However one by one the group is taken by the evil.First it's the research assistant,then it's the tow truck drivers girlfriend and next is the tow truck driver himself.To dispel the evil the professors daughter reads from the Necronimcon and a giant swirling portal opens up.Ash's car and then Ash himself get sucked into it.Next thing he knows he is plunked down into Medieval times,along with his car.He happens to arrive as a large group of soldiers are trying to kill a flying deadite.Ash takes out(what was to come to be known as)his boomstick,which sends the deadite back to where it came from.The soldiers believe he is the chosen one come back to save them and the film fades out as he screams in despair.<br />Of course the ending will lead into the third and final installment Army of Darkness.Bruce Campbell is in fine form as Ash and he virtually carries the whole movie.The co stars are mere window dressing,but watch for a cameo by director Sam's little brother Ted as the professors dead wife.This was definitely Evil Dead on a better budget as the film stock is better(35mm this time and widescreen),the S/Fx are better and Jo LoDuca is on hand to score the music;well known for his superb works in Hercules and Xena.<br />Technically speaking both the full frame and original widescreen version are presented here.Both picture and sound(in THX)have been remastered and the picture never looked better.Extras include audio commentary,still galleries,bios,the trailer and a featurette on the films making.The DVD is a one sided disc.<br />All in all a recommended film.It's Evil Dead on a better budget and will please all fans of the series.It's not a GREAT film per se',but it is satisfying none the less.It has a few scare the pants off you moments,along with some funny turns by the Campbell-meister.</p></body></html>

I first saw it in 1994 and didn't really like it then.  Now I love it.<p>I urge those who are unsure to watch it again, and let it just sink in.  How can you not enjoy those fantastic scenes which have a high re-watch factor - ie. the restaurant scene with Travolta and Thurman, and the breakfast scene where Jackson shoots the tenants. These are just two examples!<p>DVD SUMMARY:<p>Released countless times on DVD, this 2 Disc collector's edition offers more special features than earlier releases.  What I still find odd is that the film quality is still disappointing.  Apparently the original source has problems that can't be fixed.  It's not a huge problem, but there still remains scenes which are not as sharp as they should be for a film that is under 10 years old.  I've seen older films with pristine transfers.</p></body></html>

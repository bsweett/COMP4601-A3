<meta name="summary" content="A  mistaken identity wrapped in a thriller inside a con game..."></head><body><p>"Lucky Number Slevin" is a film that starts off making it clear that there is a con game going on and tries to lay out its cards on the tables in the opening scene.  This is a risky maneuver because while you will not be able to figure out "what" is going on by the explanation Bruce Willis' character gives of the precipitating event in the "Kansas City Shuffle," you have a better than average chance of answering the "who" question.  Obviously the game has already begun by this point in the story, but this is our introduction and clearly we are going to have to play catch-up.  If you have figured out "who" in the first five minute, then waiting for the "what" to be explained might get to be a bit maddening.<br /><br />This film takes another risk in that the dialogue of Jason Smilovic's screenplay is trying to achieve a nuanced feel akin to crossing Damon Runyon with Quentin Tarantino, with the former being the dominant gene (actually Smilovic made his bones developing "Karen Sisco" for television, but the connection to Elmore Leonard strikes me as being rather tenuous).  You are either going to like this way of speaking or you are going to hate it (there might be a third option in that it simply does not work).  I rather liked it and was perfectly willing to go along with the approach, largely in part because most of the weighted dialogue is coming out of the mouth of Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kinglsey.  The play the Boss and the Rabbi respectively, a pair of major gangsters who live in penthouse apartments across the street from each other, unwilling to venture out into the world because the other one will whack them.  They remind me of an old "MAD" magazine bit that contrasted the polite and refined dialogue of villains with the harsh language and tone of heroes.  Freeman's Boss being polite has the ring of a death threat.<br /><br />Also mouthing such dialogue is Josh Hartnett's Slevin, but he is a kid so it comes across as him just being fresh, which is why he gets his nose broken so many times.  Slevin is in town and when a couple of thugs show up in Nick Fisher's apartment looking for Nick Fisher, they assume Slevin is Nick.  This is a bad turn of events for Slevin and things get even worse when another couple of thugs show up and make the same assumption.  At least the second time the poor guy is actually dressed.  Fortunately, Lindsey (a scene stealing performance by Lucy Liu), Nick's neighbor across the hall is able to do more than lend a willing ear, because she sees some method to all this madness even if Sleven does not.<br /><br />I went along for the ride here and the results were largely enjoyable.  There comes a point when the funny dialogue stops, but that is because there is no longer anything funny about the situation.  The sudden gravity could be too much for some viewers as well, but in the final screen and the final set of revelations the remaining characters remain true to themselves, which seems to surprise them more than it does us.  This 2006 film is directed by Paul McGuigan ("Wicker Park"), and if he is doing a 21st version of a Hitchcock film his directing style does not call attention to the fact.  He lets the actors do the heavy lifting, and with this particular cast that is a no-brainer.  All things considered, this one is going to be hit or miss big time with audiences.  Even if you decide to wait for it to come out on DVD, give this one a shot.</p></body></html>

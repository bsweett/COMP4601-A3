<meta name="summary" content="Dolorous Dragon"></head><body><p>Anthony Hopkins, smooth and suave as always, had too much face time in "Red Dragon." Hannibal Lechter is a hard act to follow in the monstrous killer department, and he has Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) at a disadvantage. That being said, "Red Dragon" is beautifully directed by Brett Ratner, and the cinematography is brilliant.<p>Will Graham (Ed Norton) almost died in the capture of Lechter and is now semi-retired, burnt out and trying to embrace serenity at gorgeous digs on the coast of Florida with his wife and son.  His boss, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) calls the reluctant Graham back to active duty on a grisly serial killer case.  The press has labeled the killer "The Tooth Fairy" because of his modus operandi in murdering entire families in their homes.  Will, like Clarise in "Silence of the Lambs," has an eerie ability of transference into the thoughts and minds of deranged killers.<p>The picture beautifully foreshadows Dolarhyde's insanity with glimpses of his journal, voice-overs of the horrendous grandmother that raised and twisted him, and quick cuts of the spooky Home for Convalescents where he grew up.  Harvey Keitel plays Crawford brusque and brutal which gives the film some much-needed grittiness.  Ralph Fiennes and Ed Norton are both movie star handsome, which is not necessarily a plus in this type of film.  In spite of Fiennes' subtle acting and his tortured psyche, I was just too sympathetic with him to get properly scared.  Norton just did not seem like he was a battle scarred veteran or particularly traumatized; he looked like an ideal leading man, which he is.  <p>Big kudos on the cinematography and visuals:  a quick cut that shows the viewer the only horrifying way that Dolarhyde can reach a sexual climax took less than a minute and would have taken hours to explain---Dolarhyde's magnificently tattooed back making him appear a sinuous monster of prey.<p>Special congratulations to Philip Seymour Hoffman who makes the screen sizzle with his portrayal of the smarmy tabloid reporter, Freddy Lounds.  He plays off Dolarhyde's revulsion and fury with frightening realism.  Emily Watson as Dolarhyde's blind, unwitting love interest is spot on in her portrayal of a blind person, but a little too worldly wise to be believable as a na?ve victim. <p>"The Red Dragon" is a well-made, beautifully produced film.  The pace is good and doesn't have a boring moment.  Don't wait for the DVD.</p></body></html>

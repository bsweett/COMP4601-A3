<meta name="summary" content="What Color Lipstick Does Your Pig Wear?  Argento's wears Blue and Red."></head><body><p>WOW!!!  Talk about flirting with disaster!!  So, clearly I'm not an Argento-phile.  The pig I alluded to would be the film "Suspiria".  The lipstick is Dario Argento's visual style.  What I ended up with was a very visually appealing film that could have been 20 minutes long and still not have been nearly as interesting as the hype.  I can clearly hear your cries of protest and disbelief; "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MORON!!!  Believe me, I've been here before.  I'm use to it.  You would present as evidence of my suspect intelligence, approval of films like "Hatchet" and "Slugs".  Yet, I have watched this movie twice and a half and have recently watched four other Argento "classics", some of which I enjoyed to a certain degree.  So armed, I will endeavor to explain why this film didn't do it for me on a complete level (yea, this is serious stuff!!!).<br /><br />-THE PROVERBIAL PIG.<br />Of course, the "pig" in "Suspiria" is the story.  Everybody who loves this film, including the amazon.com reviewer up there, willfully dismisses the admittedly convoluted story as extraneous to the brilliance of this film.  I guess I'm screwy because I think that idea is just appalling.  Let me qualify this by saying that I am a professional artist.  I have knowledge of most of the visual arts including photography.  I'm a visual person by nature.  Yet, the visual experience in "Suspiria" was not enough for me to give the bloated and shallow story a free pass.  I understand surrealism and the attempt at a nightmarish atmosphere.  Though visually achieving these goals, the story was not given nearly the same attention to detail and thus suffered. Since my first Argento film (Tenebre) my opinion of Argento's story telling has been that he's "clumsy".After watching several other Argento films, that opinion has been greatly reinforced.  Not surprisingly, I felt the story could not match the drama of the visual experience.  My bad for expecting the Director to at least find a way to keep things moving.  The result is that I spent a lot of time waiting for something to happen... ...ANYTHING!<br /><br />-THE LIPSTICK.<br />There is just too much to say about the visual nature of this film.  Given the time it was made, it is slightly rough around the edges yet visually alluring.  From what I can tell, Argento basically invented the now clich&eacute; use of red and blue lighting to elicit a creepy feel.  Heck, I use that same lighting on my Halloween displays at home to great effect.  However, the images in "Suspiria" are more than just lighting tricks.  He clearly intended to use the primary colors with a few tertiary colors as a palate for everything in this film.  This would include bold paint schemes for the architecture.  Speaking of architecture, as an artist, I love the building locations Argento chooses for his films.  So many classic styles are on display. I almost felt I was watching a documentary on early 20th century design styles. I particularly enjoyed the Art Nouveau interiors of the dance school.  Add this to Argento's love for the creative shot and you have visual heaven.  My favorite shot in this film puts all the elements together as we look through a light bulb; beautiful.  Clearly I enjoyed the visual experience of "Suspiria".  To deny that would just be... ...pigheaded.<br /><br />-LIPSTICK PART II<br />I'm not sure how many people realize this, and it might be a key to why so many are wowed by "Suspiria" on a visual level, but this film was the very last film ever to use the "Technicolor" dye transfer process.  This highly stable process insures long term quality of color and a highly saturated color palate. Given these two advantages, this DVD and the film in general, have eye popping colors on top of the bold palate Argento employed.  Though Technicolor was not as realistic a depiction of color as other film, it actually added to the surreal quality of the visuals in "Suspiria".<br /><br />-ONE OF MY FAVORITE MUSIC SCORES.<br />See, I'm not a total loser!  I thought this music was incredible and on the cutting edge of where music was going at the time.  There are two main themes that get played over and over again, and I have to admit, I kept anticipating them eagerly.  Since this film was made when I started High School, I was much more into the music trends of the day.  This music greatly anticipates the "New Wave" African rhythm trends of the late 70s and early 1980s that Peter Gabriel so fervently promoted.  I happen to be an old Gabriel fan so this sat well with me.  The music is simultaneously very intense and sublime while heightening a sense of dread and anticipation.  The problem occurs when not much usually happens in the story to accompany the music.<br /><br />-SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH PIGS!?<br />I have no problem with pigs in general, even when used as a metaphor for a screenplay.  Heck, I love "Evil Dead II" and that has the loosest of story threads bordering on nonexistent.  But I love evil dead because it's off the wall and wildly entertaining.  I'd kiss that pig any day.  My troubles with the "Suspiria" story are lack of dynamic or interesting developments.  Now here is where many put up the red flag and say "you miss the point".  Of course I would argue that I didn't.  I've heard explanations of Suspiria's story that go kind of like this:<br /><br />"...things happen which don't always make sense or get explained, and things move slowly.  But this adds to the surreal, nightmarish experience of "Suspiria"."<br /><br />I agree with two of those points.  As far as the nightmarish experience, I'm not feeling it.  Oh, visually and musically this film has "creepy" and "nightmarish" written all over it.  However, more often than not, there is nothing going on in the story to make me feel that way.  Often, defense of the bloated story sounds like excuses to me.  This is a story that could be told around a campfire in 20 minutes.  I don't mean to oversell my dissatisfaction with this film.  I didn't hate it.  But when the most brutal and frightening moment in the film occurs in the first 15 minutes, everything else is a bit of a letdown.  Ultimately, it was the lack of fear or dread compounded by overwrought attention to mundane action that bored me with "Suspiria".<br /><br />-FLAP, FLAP, SCREAM, WAVE, FLAP, FLAP...<br />To further the lack of scariness, a few very silly and unintentionally funny scenes appear in "Suspiria".  One involves what might be the worst fake dog head ever.  Other things about that scene are funny too, but I've said enough.  The other is a scene with a bat that highlights why this film lacked the proper ingredients for me to bestow greatness upon it.  In this scene, a character is attacked by a little, fat, motorized bat.  Now, this sounds funny enough, but there is more.  Said bat attacks for what seems like 5 minutes.  All the while, his victim waives arms and screams with little conviction while standing in one spot.  Finally, the bat flies off into the corner and apparently tries to flush the toilet.  I'm kind of joking because I'm not sure what the little bugger was doing.  Finally he decides to attack from the ground; "hump, hump, hump", he thumps towards the still stationary victim.  It ends quite beautifully but I won't elaborate.  Unfortunately, I laughed very hard at this stuff.  Immediately after this diabolical bat attack, the mood of the film was completely moot to me.  Nothing happens after that to make up for a complete lack of dread or fear on my part.  It just wasn't good enough.<br /><br />-IT'S SCARY BEING ME.<br />Sorry Argento-philes; the story here is just too uneventful for me to bestow greatness on "Suspiria".  The film does a lot of things in a great way but the overall story lacked the required substance to keep me on edge.  Not even the glorious visuals in Technicolor combined with one of the best soundtracks ever in a horror film could make me sit on the edge of my seat or scare me for that matter.  I will admit that the second viewing was better than the first, so thank goodness I deferred reviewing after one look.  However, the enhanced enjoyment wasn't because the film got better in my eyes; it was because I knew to pay more attention to the visual and musical aspects than to invest effort into the story.  Yet, all the coolness of image and sound could not overcome the hype of how scary this movie is supposed to be.  A little bit edgy?  Okay.  But without a flowing, eventful, scary story, this film will always be incomplete to me.<br /><br />Visuals....5 Stars<br />Music......5 Stars<br />Acting.....3.5 Stars<br />Story......2 Stars<br /><br />Average....3.88 Stars</p></body></html>

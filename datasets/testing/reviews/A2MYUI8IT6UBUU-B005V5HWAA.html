<meta name="summary" content="Mr. Brooks Movie Review"></head><body><p>A brilliantly clever thriller, Mr. Brooks delivers enough shocks and revelations that you'll never know what's going to happen next. Kevin Costner is at his absolute best as the crafty Brooks, and William Hurt's supporting performance is equally magnificent. Perhaps the most innovative and unique film involving a split personality, Mr. Brooks introduces us to an antagonist we simply have to side with and one that is comparable to cinema's most fascinating villain, Hannibal Lector.<br /><br />Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) leads a normal life, running his box design business, admiring his lovely wife and coping with a typical troubled teenage daughter. Normal, that is, except for Marshall (William Hurt), his alternate personality, who continues to coerce him into murder. Constantly fighting his addiction, he is photographed one night committing a particularly grisly murder, by "Mr. Smith" (Dane Cook) who blackmails Earl into taking him along on the next murder. Meanwhile, Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is in search of the mysterious "Thumbprint Killer" and believes Mr. Smith is harboring some undisclosed clues. As Mr. Brooks' family life and his life of crime slowly converge, he must decide how to permanently stop his literally murderous addiction.<br /><br />Kevin Costner's performance is nothing short of phenomenal. He captures the screen and portrays a wickedly clever character that you simply can't take your eyes off of. Cold and ruthless as a murderer, yet also calm, collected and grotesquely artistic, he calculates every possibility and scenario to plan the perfect murders. Having a unique idiosyncrasy, the "Thumbprint Killer" (as dubbed by the authorities) repositions the victim's bodies into various poses after he kills them. And of course the major twist to this psychopath is his alternate personality, here played by a separate actor, also mustering up an outstanding performance. William Hurt is Marshall, Earl's darker, more malevolent alter ego who instructs and advises him, especially when it comes to murder. His role is used for comic relief at times and to demonstrate Earl's complex thinking. The most innovative aspect of this split personality concept is that Marshall truly exists only in Earl's mind. He cannot control Earl, he can't physically interfere with anything, and Earl is constantly aware of him.<br /><br />Much like the demon and angel that sits on either shoulder of the lead character in countless cartoons and comedies, Marshall influences Earl's decisions but is unable to physically alter anything. And yet Mr. Brooks enjoys killing enough that even without his alter ego we are lead to believe that serial killing is not beyond his reach, which conflicts with the popular Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy; both personalities instead lean toward psychotic dispositions. Marshall's personality doesn't actually progress the story, essentially making it ironically unnecessary, except for how engrossing and innovative that particularly uncommon aspect is portrayed.<br /><br />Demi Moore is Tracy Atwood, who has been investigating the Thumbprint Killer for years. Easily the weakest link in the film, her character takes a backseat even to Hurt's alter ego (who is most often literally in the backseat). At several points in the film she dons the armor of a serious action star, which feels sorely misplaced. Her subplot could have been cut entirely to shorten the running time of the film.<br />I was a bit worried about Dane Cook's appearance in a serious thriller but he pulls off his role without a hitch. And the reason is once again because of a twist. A hilariously eccentric take on the blackmailer, Cook doesn't want money; rather he wants to accompany Brooks on his next murder. Obtaining a similar adrenaline rush for killing, he is a bold new form of accomplice.<br /><br />Director Bruce Evans throws in an ample helping of comedy elements into the violence and murders, presumably to break up the occasional incredibly graphic bloodshed. Brooks is perhaps even scarier because his family life is so normal. He has seemingly basic problems controlling his teenage daughter, and a healthy relationship with his wife.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is complex and morbidly intriguing and is perhaps the most innovative twist on a serial killer movie in decades. Brooks prays for forgiveness and prays to God to cease his never-ending killing spree, but his guilty conscience continually haunts him. A Hannibal Lector of sorts, Costner's Brooks is a bad guy so ingeniously scripted that we root for him even though he is the most psychotic of all the characters introduced. Curiously, we prefer to see him get away with murder just like Hannibal, and side with him not for his obviously flawed morals, but because he's just so much fun to watch.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></body></html>

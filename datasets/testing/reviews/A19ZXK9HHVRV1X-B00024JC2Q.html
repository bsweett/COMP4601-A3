<meta name="summary" content="surprisingly funny film"></head><body><p>"Starsky and Hutch" is a genuine surprise, a clever and funny sendup of not only the popular TV series from the 1970's but all those cop-buddy scenarios that have flooded screens both large and small for decades now.  The convention in these tales is to take two cops with diametrically opposed personalities and team them up as fearless crime fighters.  Thus, we have Starsky, the stuffy, by-the-book, idealistic cop who takes his job seriously and actually believes he is making the streets safe for law-abiding, paired up with Hutch, a laid-back, cynical pragmatist who has no illusions about the nobility of his profession and no qualms about bending the rules when he sees the chance of getting a little personal gain out of it.<br /><br />"Starsky and Hutch" has a great time poking fun at the cliches of its genre, never taking itself or the era in which it is set too seriously.  In fact, the movie does a fine job satirizing the fashions, trends and music of the 1970's in all their kitschy, tacky glory.  In a clever in-joke, the movie has Hutch singing an acoustic version of "Don't Give Up On Us," the sappy number one hit recorded by the original Hutch, David Soul, in 1977.<br /><br />Of the actors, Ben Stiller steals the show as Starsky, bringing to the character a quality of deadpan seriousness that makes him a sympathetic figure even as he becomes more and more the butt of the movie's jokes.  The screenplay spins many a convention of the cop buddy movie on its head.  For instance, invariably in these films, one of the cops has a father who distinguished himself years earlier as a model officer on the force, and now his rookie son has to live up to the family reputation.  In this case, however, it is Starsky's MOTHER who set the standard for bravery and courage in the precinct and Starksy knows he cannot let her memory down.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is somewhat less effective as Hutch, mainly because the character has been conceived as essentially the same wisecracking slacker Wilson plays in virtually all his movies.  Still, the two actors generate an effective rapport on the screen, one that helps us over some of the rough spots that set in from time to time.  For indeed, the movie, like most big screen comedies, can't sustain the hilarity through the entirety of its running time.  Nevertheless, "Starsky and Hutch" does a better job than most at making us laugh and does so without ever insulting our intelligence.  That's quite an accomplishment, actually, in this day and age.</p></body></html>

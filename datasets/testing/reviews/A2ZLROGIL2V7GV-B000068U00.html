<meta name="summary" content="One Hell of a Movie!  The New DVD is Amazing!!!!"></head><body><p>"Reservoir Dogs" is another one of my favorite movies.  Despite what critics think, this is a Tarantino masterpiece with unforgettable characters, smooth and cool dialogue, and a shocking finale.<br /><br />I had the older version of this movie on DVD, and it was all right.  The picture wasn't too bad, sound was so-so, and there were virtually no special features.  So when I found out that a new remastered and fully-loaded version of the movie was coming out, I knew I had to have it.  And I am very glad that I did purchase it.<br /><br />Since this is a crime flick, the plot and storyline isn't that complex or deep, and there is no reason for it to be.  It's pretty simple.  Perfect strangers plan the perfect crime, but end up in a bloody set-up.  With only four of them left alive, they must uncover the rat in the house.  But which one is it?  That is something they must find out before the cops get a hold of them in this unforgiving and spectacular crime/noir movie.<br /><br />The writing is off the hook.  Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue.  Why?  Because the characters talk like real people.  In ordinary movies, all the characters ever talk about it the plot or scheme.  In THIS movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing.  His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.<br /><br />The cast is terrific.  Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and Steve Buscemi all did their roles justice.  Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role.  Buscemi is hillarious, and your eyes never leave his sight when he's on screen.  But really, everyone is outstanding in this movie.<br /><br />The DVD itself is very high quality, including two disks.  The picture is remastered in high definition, which really makes it clear.  Ten times better than the other version.  You can either watch in widescreen or in fullscreen.  The sound is also much, MUCH better.  You can watch it in dolby digital or in DTS.  Considering that this was a really  low-budget film, the movie looks and sounds amazing.  You will especially appreciate it if you had the previous DVD of the movie.<br /><br />And there are tons and TONS of extras that will keep you more than happy.  Way too many for me to list, but the ones I liked the most were the interviews.  (Watch the one with Michael Madsen.  That has to be one of the funniest interviews I have ever seen.  Just trust me and watch it!  I don't want to give too much away.)  So, if you are a big fan of bells and whistles, this DVD is the one for you.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, I was more than pleased with this edition of "Reservoir Dogs."  I did not mind re-buying it at all.  If you still have the original DVD and love this movie very much, GET THIS ONE AS SOON AS YOU CAN!  You will not regret it.  This is one of my favorites, and proves just how talented Quentin Tarantino is when it comes to writing and directing.</p></body></html>

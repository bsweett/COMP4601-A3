<meta name="summary" content="The Thriller is Entertaining; the Romance is Boring"></head><body><p>Random thoughts about The Interpreter:<br /><br />-- what kind of background security checks do they do at the UN (as envsiaged in this film) if someone with Nicole Kidman's history is so easily hired on?<br /><br />-- how many languages does she interpret anyway??<br /><br />-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous?<br /><br />-- why does Sean Penn need most of the movie to fall in love in Nicole Kidman?<br /><br />-- same question, roles reversed?<br /><br />-- it's always wonderful to see footage of Africa, even a baleful Africa.<br /><br />-- is the old dictator thinking in the climactic scene, "shoot me if you must, but spare me the philosophizing"?<br /><br />-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous?<br /><br />-- why isn't this movie forty minutes shorter?<br /><br />-- and even when they do find out that they love each other, the audience reaction -- at least this audience -- is, "who cares!!"<br /><br />-- Clint Eastwood makes a better Secret Service agent than Sean Penn.<br /><br />-- too bad nobody gets to ride on AirForce One.<br /><br />-- Sean Penn looks like he needs sleep even when he's had sleep.<br /><br />-- the long set-up to the most spectacular scene of the movie is really tense and well-done.<br /><br />-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous?<br /><br />Finally, one problem with The Interpreter is that all of these mind-static thoughts take place simultaneously with watching the movie.  That's a big problem.  Still, while you don't for a minute believe anything that is happening on screen in The Interpreter and the Penn-Kidman chemistry is deader than a dodo, this is a good (in the wonderful Spanish word) "pasatiempo" -- which I roughly translate as "mindless entertainment."</p></body></html>

He just wouldn't quit until he had created the classic known as "Jaws".  And he pulled it off.  We hear in the making-of documentaries of how the mechanical shark would always be on the fritz!  And of the actors waiting for hours, or days, to complete a given scene!  It must have been hell!  Especially considering the locales!  But this, in the final analysis of this landmark picture, actually proved to ADD to the suspense of the final cut!  Because the darn maneater refused to eat, Steven was forced to shoot many a scene (intended to include the predator) without the shark...proving once more the theory: the scariest things are the things we CAN'T see!  And when we finally see those huge jaws opened for the first time....WOW! What an impact!  I still jump when I see it!<br /><br />This film has all elements that make up a classic thriller: tension beyond belief, suspense, great acting, and the occasional "Oh Jesus!" surprise shocks.  I wonder how many people who have seen this movie were scared to death at the very end when the camera follows Brody & Hooper toward the shore...thinking, just maybe, another "bite" was coming!  (I know I did!) Ever wonder what Jaws would look like if made today featuring all the advanced computer imaging??  Might have been interesting. But it certainly would NOT have had as much suspense as the 1975 Jaws, because no doubt the shark would have popped his head out of the water much earlier in the film.  Nah....You can't improve on a Classic anyway!  And Jaws is definitely that!<br /><br />The Universal Home Video DVD has some very nice Bonus Features on it too -- a great "Making-Of" feature, some deleted scenes and outtakes, trailers, and more.<br /><br />The Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer on the "25th Anniversary" DVD Edition is first-rate as well. Rock solid. The Dolby 5.1 audio is of high quality too.<br /><br />DVD Recommendation Of The First Order!<br /><br />"Hooper!! Ya idiot!!"</p></body></html>

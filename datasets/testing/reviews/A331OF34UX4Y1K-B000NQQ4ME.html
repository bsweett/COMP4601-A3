<meta name="summary" content="Blood lust and gore - just that"></head><body><p>I don't care if it was Mel Gibson who directed this gore fest.<br /><br />Any movie, directed by anyone, that has this amount of stabbing, mutilating, raping, maming, slicing and gratuitous violence should have flopped in the box office. But, as we can see by the reviews posted here, people seem to enjoy this kind of lunatic enterprise.<br /><br />The trouble was they gave an Oscar to Gibson for "Braveheart". So he thought (correctly, apparently...): "Blood is the way to go. I found my niche." What a shame tha a director / actor so rich spends his money to create this nauseous films. I just cannot understand.</p></body></html>

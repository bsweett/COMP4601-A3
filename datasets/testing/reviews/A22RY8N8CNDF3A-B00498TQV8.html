<meta name="summary" content="Exquisitely Stark Story of Young Girl's Strength"></head><body><p>"Winter's Bone" is set in the Ozarks during a hard winter for a 17 year old girl taking care of her dirt poor family.  Her mother has had a nervous breakdown, and her father has jumped bail for charges of making methamphetamine.  The 17 year old, Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), has had to grow up fast, and take on parenting her two younger siblings.  They are living on the edge - almost starving - when she learns from the local bail bondsman that her father put a lien on their home.  The sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs her that her father, Jessup, has not shown up for his scheduled court appearance, and she only has a week to find him.  Ree feels the overwhelming responsibility of making sure the family can keep the land and home, their only asset and place to live.  She steels her spirit and is determined to keep the house and property.<br /><br />Ree sets out to find her father, knowing her life could be in danger as well.  She has many confrontations, and a physical beating by the local farmers to keep her off her father's trail.  The worst thing in the community is to be a "snitch".  She hears rumors that her dad was killed in a methamphetamine brewing session that went wrong.  She does not believe it, but continues to confront her father's pals in his drugged life.  Her Uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes) helps her in a round-about way, as well as a crusty old hag named Merab (Dale Dickey) who knows more than she lets on.  The whole community is covering up for the illegal drugs and bad habits of their "clan".  The ties that bind are revealed through their squalid, near Neanderthal living conditions.  The community reminded me of junkyard dogs all fighting for a bone, but bonded by blood and experience.<br /><br />Slowly clues add up for Jessup's fate and Ree's realization she has to carry the full responsibility of family.<br /><br />The movie is rough and tender, a fantastic story of strength when life is cold and cruel.  "Winter's Bone" is fabulous in all facets, the noir cinematography<br />and location all combine synergy with a great story and fantastic acting by the entire cast.</p></body></html>

I guess the execs felt safe retelling an old story using big-name stars.  But the end product was just another empty action adventure with cardboard cut-out characters.  While Russell Crowe was inspiring in Gladiator, Brad Pitt falls flat as Achilles.  Frankly he is not a very good actor and has done nothing noteworthy since Fight Club.  I was not bored by this movie, but I was also not moved by it either.  Its worth renting, but noting more.</p></body></html>

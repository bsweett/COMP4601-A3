High Tension is a textbook example of this unerring phenomenon.  This French film was released in, strange as it may seem, France back in 2003.  That particular version of the film was slated for a not so box-office friendly NC-17 here in the states.  "No way", said the money puppeteers, ahem, studio executives.<br /><br />So how much did they cut from the film to get that oh so desirable R rating?  Surely we're missing buckets of gore, oodles of flesh, mountains of viscera, well, you get where I'm going with this.  But what's that?  Surely it can't be.  The amount of time cut from the original French version.  It's shocking!  It's colossal!<br /><br />It's apparently just over one extra minute of onscreen gore.  Over 60 seconds and under 120 seconds.<br /><br />I'm sitting here, scratching my head in the land of the "Free".  How is it that those of us in America lucky enough to make it to adulthood allow for censorship to take place?  We can drink, smoke cigarettes, buy pornography, and load up on firearms, but for some unknown reason we have institutions like the MPAA coddling us, holding our hands, and covering our eyes from what, make believe gore and simulated violence?<br /><br />Tell you what though, that minute plus of French carnage must have been extremely nasty to get excised from this film.  Because what I saw today at my local megaplex/movie shrine was a gleefully sadistic, clever, and over the top splatter fest.<br /><br />In other words, I liked it.  Alot.<br /><br />Sure it takes many elements from other slasher films, but when I left the theater I felt as if I'd seen something original and actually worthy of bearing the banner of Horror.<br /><br />The dubbing was also a trip.  Although for some reason some parts were dubbed and others weren't.  Which actually added to the fun.<br /><br />When I know that the dismemberment, cruelty, and bloodshed are done according to a script and that no one actually gets hurt I enjoy the terror and the dread, because I know it's not happening to me.  It's make believe, pretend, not real. Hopefully some day we'll be able to say the same thing about censorship(or at least the MPAA) here in America.<br /><br />So Europe, keep making movies like this.  Eventually us Yanks will see them, even if we have to wait for the DVD release.<br /><br />P.S.  Did I mention that I despise the MPAA?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Good Movie, not a Great Movie."></head><body><p>Ang Lee directed this film as if he was impressed with himself, impressed with his split screens and editing, impressed with his "artistry." In this blender of pretention, the Hulk I grew up on manages to peak through.<br /><br />Okay, we do have to creep through scenes of heavy handed angst and repression.<br /><br />Still, once the Hulk breaks out of his clothes, the fun begins!<br /><br />The CGI Hulk is at times totally convincing, at other times plastic looking. Too bad the effects wizards weren't more consistent.<br /><br />There are still plenty of great effects, many "Hulk Smash" scenes, and the soundtrack is incredible!!<br /><br />The concluding battle is too brief,  but at least this movie has more "jaw dropping" moments than the average super-hero film.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, the author of "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

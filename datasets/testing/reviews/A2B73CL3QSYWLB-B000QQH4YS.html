He seems to wallow in the decadent and take a bleak world-view, particularly as it pertains to the United States.  "Robocop" contains a number of Verhoeven's favorite themes but there are a number of redeeming features that elevates it above his normal fare.  First off, it is deliciously darkly comic.  The special effects and sound editing are superb.  Ronny Cox as a corporate shark and Kurtwood Smith as a hired thug give outstanding villainous turns.  What ultimately redeems this film, though, are the humane performances of Peter Weller as Alex Murphy a.k.a Robocop and Nancy Allen as his partner.  Weller in particular shines because he is not only called upon to act with heavy body armor on but also make his character sympathetic.  It is debatable whether "Robocop" is classic sci-fi but it is terrifically entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Flat, unsavoury techno-thriller"></head><body><p>"Firewall" is a hostage thriller with an IT bent. Sadly Harrison Ford is not convincing as an IT geek who can bust heads when he needs to and Paul Bettany is flat and uninteresting as the ruthless villian. Contains the usual off-hand brutality of this type of film and really, how much fun is it to watch a family being held hostage?<br /><br />"Firewall" adds nothing to the techno-thriller genre and isn't Ford getting a bit too old to be playing these types of roles?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A tragic imaginative journey"></head><body><p>There is a certain untreated condition going around nowadays, and for some reason it often seems to attack contemporary filmgoers, as some of the negative reviews of this fine film will attest.  This condition is called Limited Imagination.  What once made Americans such avid fans of television shows like The Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond, and Thriller appears to have faded a bit with time.  We can only hope that a few thousand bad apples (or stale apples, to put it more aptly), cannot ruin the entire bunch.<br /><br />That said, "The Jacket" is weird cinema at it's finest; while there may be some stereotypical themes in it (a strange man lacking memory) and oft used plot twists (time reversal), it transcends "The Butterfly Effect", "Memento", and a good deal of what passes for loopy film nowadays.<br /><br />Adrien Brody gives a powerhouse performance as Jack Starks, a Gulf War Veteran wrongly accused of murdering a sherrif while trekking his way back home, recovering from a near fatal headshot in the war.  What I think helps make "Jacket" more than your typical exercise in Hamster Wheel Sci-Fi is the thorough characterization of Starks.  Chiefly a victim of horrid cirumstance, he is also a resilient, basically kind man with an uncanny awareness that closely matches his quite uncanny circumstances.<br /><br />He is convicted of murder but escapes prison by reason of his fragile mental condition;Kris Kristofferson (who I initially mistook for William Hurt) plays the corrupt Dr. Becker, who runs an asylum for the criminally insane and violent.  Starks obviously does not belong there, and Becker seems to know this, but is too disdainful of his "clients" to care.  "The Jacket" is a reference to the questionable method Becker employs to induce hallucinations in his patients (it is never fully explained why he wants to do this, which is the only serious flaw in the complex plot.)  Starks is strapped down, injected with some sort of psychotropic hallucinogen, and essentially shut into a drawer which looks exactly like a morgue slab.<br /><br />Enduring terrible flashbacks to his war experience, the eeriest scenes in the movie take place here.  We come to know Starks as a human being, over and apart from his horrendous lot in life; and something else develops--a relationship with a miserable young alcholic (attractive, of course) who Starks encountered as a child on his ill-fated journey home.  Yes, this is very complex.<br /><br />Each viewer should find out for themselves precisely what Starks is, and should know halfway through that he is neither delusional nor insane but possessing an unnatural lucidity which ultimately leads to his triumph over the paradox of his tragic life.  The reason this film is lost on so many who normally enjoy movies of this ilk is because it has a moral.  We do not find out that Starks is merely a madman or anything of the sort, as our nihilistic postmodern viewers would have it.  Deserving of more than one viewing, "The Jacket" is, well, fantastic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Creepy, subversive psychological horror"></head><body><p>Agnes is living in a dingy motel room.  Her ex has just gotten out of prison.  Her boy went missing years ago.  She is lonely...until she hooks up with Peter, a shy and charming drifter.  But Peter isn't exactly what he seems...for he is convinced that there are bugs crawling through his veins, feasting on his blood.  And what's more: he's convinced Agnes has them, too...<br /><br />"Bug" isn't easy to watch for a number of reasons.  One: the acting is so realistic, so intense, it's hard to think of it as a movie.  Ashley Judd is a phenomenon here; Michael Shannon matches her step-for-step.  Harry Connick Jr., as Agnes's sadistic ex, is an utter thrill.  The cast is small--these three carry the film for most of its length--and the setting is small: most of the movie takes place in a motel room, the last few scenes featuring a motel room with walls papered in aluminum foil.<br /><br />Another reason "Bug" isn't wasy to watch is...well, bugs.  Let's face it, they make most of us squeemish...though you don't actually see any bugs in this film, which leads us to my next reason: This movie leaves a lot of open questions.  Are they real?  Is it all in their heads?  This is true psychological horror--it scares you, but you're not sure how.  It's psychological horror with a very physical bent; the scene where Peter rips out his tooth is absolutely horrifying.  "Bug" isn't perfect, but it's certainly one of the best horror movies to come out in a while, and it's a fine return to the genre for directer William Friedkin, who blessed us all with "The Exorcist."  Watch this movie only if you like your horror realistic, creepy...and genuinely frightening.</p></body></html>

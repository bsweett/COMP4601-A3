<meta name="summary" content="Bad Movie"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was everything that the critics said. It was bad. I thought Colin Farrell was totally miscast, as was Angelina Jolie as his MOTHER? Val Kilmer was pretty bad too. All that said, I think that the story of Alexander was or is just too vast and it seemed like they were trying to throw all his story into one movie and it was like trying to cram 50 pounds of gay love into a 5 pound reel of film. I guess that Alexanders sexuality might be bi/homosexual/insestuous with his mother or whatever but really, who cares? With all the magnificent things he did in his short life Oliver Stone seems to want to concentrate on his sexuality more than putting time into making a good movie. Jared Letos part as Colin Farrells boytoy was nauseating not because they were lovers but because his character was underdeveloped and basically consisted of he and Farrell making goo goo eyes at each other every time they were in each others site.<br /><br />This is simply just not a good movie.</p></body></html>

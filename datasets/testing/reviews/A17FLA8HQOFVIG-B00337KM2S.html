<meta name="summary" content="A real surprise zinger at the end which made a good film great!"></head><body><p>Nominated for 6 Academy Awards, this 2009 film is as timely as today's headlines (or I should say last year's headlines).  It's set in the turbulent times of office layoffs during the recession. George Clooney is cast as the hatchet man and he really loves his job.  He travels all the time and doesn't even have his own apartment because he's always in the air.  He loves this life he leads which consists of airports, fancy hotels, and occasional one night stands. We see him in an amorous adventure with Vera Farmiga.  She's also a high-powered executive who flies all the time and they meet for torrid couplings whenever they can. Suddenly things change.  Technology has entered the business and his boss wants to make these formerly face-to-face firings through computer screens. He's hired a hotshot aggressive young woman, Anna Kendrick, to manage this.  Clooney complains against this but his boss sends the young woman on a trip with him to test out this new system.<br /><br />Naturally they are complications.  Some of them are the sad responses of the people being fired.  Another is how the presence of this young woman effects the relationship between Clooney and Famrmiga.  Some of this is outrageously funny and I found myself laughing out loud.  And other parts brought tears to my eyes as the people being fired watched their lives collapse.  And then there is Clooney's family, who is hosting a wedding for his niece.<br /><br />All of this seemed very real.  The film moves fast and includes trials and tribulations as well s some high comic moments.  And then, just when I thought I knew how the film would end, there was a real surprise zinger which changed everything.<br /><br />This is a really fine film.  Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

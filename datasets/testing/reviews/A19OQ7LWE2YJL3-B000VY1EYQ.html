For while in the end our protagonist gets some cash and gets away from Earl, it is not enough.<br /><br />The acting was superb.  Andy Griffith was fantastic in his role as the crusty pie shop owner. Nathan Fillion was superb as the besotted obstetrician, and Keri Russell was fabulous in her pie-making down-trodden wife role.<br /><br />The direction was also fabulous.<br />The script was a let-down.  We like the doctor's wife a little too much, she's sweet. And Earl is not portrayed quite badly enough.<br />I loved the pie-naming's.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Forrest Whittaker gives us a tiny look into a strange dictator in a strange land"></head><body><p>Talk about tackling the big and prickly issues. Anyone familiar with the African continent, the wide range of countries with their respective governments will most certainly understand the poverty, misery and suffering that pretty well blankets it all.<br /><br />Idi Amin was not a verfy likeable character and he managed to keep control of his empire by taking ALL his political enemies with him whenever he left the country. By doing this 24/7 he managed to calm his paranoia until the end of his reign when things went 'amuk'. Idi Amin was one of histories smartest dictators attesting to he fact that he died of illness in Saudi Arabia many years after being ousted. That in itself was quite a feat.<br /><br />This movie takes all these issues into account and does not place itself in a position of criticism of Amin but rather that of a story teller without getting into the violence of what was realty.<br /><br />The acting is stupendous and the movie was a real pleasure to watch.....</p></body></html>

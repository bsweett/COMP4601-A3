Acting is very good (I still dislike all the roles Streep plays, including this one). With current technology, it is much more believable then it might have been 40 years ago when it might have been written off as cold war paranoia. Scary. Not surprising that Demme also directed "Silence of the Lambs", where the scariness is more in the mind than in blood and gore.</p></body></html>

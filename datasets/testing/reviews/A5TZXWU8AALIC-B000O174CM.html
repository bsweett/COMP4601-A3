<meta name="summary" content="A Movie Too Good to be a Musical"></head><body><p>I've never seen the Broadway show of DREAMGIRLS but I know it's been around for a long time.  Maybe if I'd followed this story's history better I could've navigated the movie a little better...but I was thrown by the insertion of conventional musical numbers into a really good dramatic film.<br /><br />It's a story about music so there could've been plenty of songs but having the actors burst into song during some heavy dramatic scenes threw me off a little.  It didn't have to lapse into that convention.<br /><br />Everyone was excellent.  Eddie Murphy was outstanding.  It's a finely-crafted film that left me wondering just how far removed it was from the real-life story of Diana Ross and the Supremes.</p></body></html>

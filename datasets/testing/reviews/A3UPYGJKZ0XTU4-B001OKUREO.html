<meta name="summary" content="Unflattering but not Unsympathetic Study of George W. Bush's Slow Rise and Rapid Fall."></head><body><p>Like 1995's "Nixon", "W." is a character study of a disgraced conservative president by the famously leftist Oliver Stone that is fundamentally sympathetic to its subject's emotions but unsympathetic to the President's actions. "W" doesn't have the depth or nuance of "Nixon", however. Written by Stanley Weiser, the film was shot in only 46 days. Stone calls it a "trim-down movie" in which scenes and procedures are simplified and sets less elaborate than they would be in reality. The film takes us through George W. Bush's adult life, starting in 2002 with the President's preparation for his "axis of evil" speech and backtracking to his college days at Yale. It proceeds in this way, alternating between preparations for the Iraq war and Bush's earlier life until the two converge.<br /><br />"W" draws on books written about the 43rd president to present George W. Bush (Josh Brolin) as the black sheep of the Bush family, a man driven to take on more than he can handle by his need to impress his disapproving father (James Cromwell), but constrained by a critical lack of intellect: An amiable imbecile who easily falls prey to less amiable men, like Vice President Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) and Karl Rove (Toby James), who need to put a friendly face on their sweeping agendas. Josh Brolin's performance is adequate, but I felt it relies too much on mannerisms. The supporting cast is generally impressive, but Richard Dreyfuss deserves special mention for his interpretation of Cheney's overbearing self-belief. Although the film clearly sees Bush as incompetent and his inner circle as lunatic, there is a darkly comic undertone to their conversations. It's making fun of these people.<br /><br />The DVD (Lions Gate 2009): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (1 ? min), a documentary by Sean Stone called "Dangerous Dynasty: The Bush Legacy" (17 min) which interviews people about the increasingly authoritarian Bush presidencies. There is a feature commentary by Oliver Stone in which he speaks mostly of George W. Bush's life and what he chose to include in the film, but some about the performances and filming. If you're interested in the film's source materials, the disc is a DVD-ROM (Mac or Windows) containing a "Filmmaker Research and Annotations Guide" in PDF. This is 108 pages of annotations and sources (books, articles, television, press conferences, etc.) for the scenes and ideas in the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></body></html>

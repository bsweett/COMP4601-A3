<meta name="summary" content="a revisited classic"></head><body><p>1st saw approx 5 yrs ago, and yeah, it was ok.  Recently decided to revisit with purchase of 50th anniv. 2-dvd set.  Wow! I must have been asleep the 1st go around! Everything about this film clicks: writing, directing, acting, cinematography, scoring, and the sheer class of it all. Disc 2 has 3 hrs of substantial extras, incl. 90 min. spotlight on Cary Grant, and 60 min.  on A.H. himself ("the master's touch"). All in all, a superb set. The visual quality is top drawer, but can any one tell me if the blu is a significant improvement over this dvd (before I purchase yet again!)?  (thanks in advance)</p></body></html>

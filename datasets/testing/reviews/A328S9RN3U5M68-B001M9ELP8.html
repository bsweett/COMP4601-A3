It is not deep, it is not profound, it does not take itself too seriously.  That is the fun of it: intrigue, danger, capture, bad guy vs. good guy  are all served by Director Peter Berg with an emphasis on our having a good time.  The Rock is a surprisingly good actor and a very fine martial arts proponent. Christopher Walken contributes his usual keen study of evil with a twist, Rosario Dawson provides a delectable heroine, but the real surprise is Seann William Scott (why oh why do capable actors have to futz with names like "Seann" and "The Rock" as though they don't want to be taken seriously?), an actor primarily known for his jerky toilet mouth roles in such things as American Pie 1 & 2, American Wedding, Old School, Road Trip, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Scott is in a role here that 1) shows his estimable physique 2) displays quality comic timing and 3) lets us see him in a role that actually requires skill.  The story is sort of a rehash of the Indiana Jones tales, but it is delivered with gusto and tongue in cheek by a fine cast under tight direction.  A good time!</p></body></html>

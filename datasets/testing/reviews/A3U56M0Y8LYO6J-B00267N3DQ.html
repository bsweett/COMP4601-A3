As the first feature length animated film made, it will forever be credited with expanding the possibilities of the medium.  Understandably, as a first effort, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" comes across as simple, underdeveloped, and devoid of self-awareness compared to modern animated fare.  Yet this is precisely why it has maintained its charm throughout the years.  This film harks back to a simpler era when motion pictures were more concerned with creating magic on screen and less concerned with being relevant.  It is a work filled with passion and assembled with tender, loving care.  It is a work that has stood the test of time and which continues to endure.<p>Surely everyone is familiar with the Snow White story by now.  Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) is a young and beautiful princess who must escape to the woods to avoid being harmed by her wicked stepmother, the Queen (Lucille La Verne).  She takes refuge with seven dwarfs who each possess an apt unique name but a poison apple puts her under a harmful spell.  Thankfully Prince Charming (Harry Stockwell) arrives and, with a single kiss, thwarts the Queen's evil scheme and provides the requisite fairy tale ending.<p>Even though this film was released in 1937, the animation still looks magnificent today.  All of the character move fluidly and the attention to detail in the backgrounds are amazing.  The voice talent all distinguish themselves even though Snow White's voice sometimes gets on your nerves.  Yet, that aspect of the film is more than balanced out by the wonderful singing scenes with the dwarfs and the strong characterization of the evil Queen.  While later Disney films have surpassed "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" in technical and narrative terms, their first animated venture still remains a jewel in the Disney crown.</p></body></html>

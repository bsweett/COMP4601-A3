<meta name="summary" content="watch this then watch those films on 9/11 conspiracy theories"></head><body><p>then you might have some doubts of what really happened to united 93. yes, this movie gave you a picture of the uncommon valor of the passengers on united 93, but to think back, it looks more like a well staged propaganda movie. yes, how could it possible that the cabin recording device would have possibly recorded the conversation in the passenger cabin and outside of the door? and all those cell phone conversations on such high altitude in a fast moving flying airplane? how it was possible to have these kinda conversations to different states and different cities? even without roaming charge or with voice mail they'd still be impossible. we used to got lot of drop called even we are on the ground, standing on a fixed spot or in a moving car. even the best rated cellphone service providers, verizon, sprint...whatever, if the calling areas without enough transmitting pods, we'd lose signals no matter what. and on a fast movie flying airplane? if you don't use satellite phone, it'd be impossible to get a connection. besides, like what i just realized, yes, when i call my mom, i never said first 'hi, mom, this is mr. so and so, your son calling...' did i ever have to mention my full name to my mom when i called her? of course not.<br />furthermore, why there's almost nothing left on the crash site? usually, when passenger airplane crashed on land, there should be a lot of charred bodies, luggages, chairs, parts of wings, usually intact turbine engines....littered all over the places, but why there's only a big hole in the crash site, and then the government bulldozed  and levelled it right away? what kinda cover up is this? then released this totally dramatized tear jerker to digress your logic thinking. what's going on?<br />with these questions in mind, this whole United 93 incident looks more like a staged drama not based on a true story as it claimed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nice DVD package"></head><body><p>I missed the Fantastic Four, aka FF in the theatres and as any self-respecting Marvel comic fan, had to watch the DVD in spite of the mixed reviews I'd heard.<br /><br />The good news is: the movie is watchable.  It's not perfect, and I still rate the X-men and the Incredibles ahead of this.  The effects are well crafted, and much thought has been put into the visual approach.<br /><br />What else is good about this: Great casting of Von Doom (Julian McMahon of Nip/Tuck) and Chris Evans as the Human Torch.  Jessica Alba looks great too.<br /><br />What could have been better:  This entire film was more like an introduction to the Four rather than a complete movie experience.  Sometimes feels like a TV show.  Since a sequel is in the works, we'll just have to wait.<br /><br />Weak Chink for me: Mr Fantastic is pretty average.  And Dr Doom's origins are less compelling than the real comic book Dr Doom.<br /><br />As some reviews say above, the Fantastic Four isn't about characterisations, and yet, one feels that the chemistry of the four could've been tweaked up a notch instead of falling back purely on the comic book landscape / approach of simple characters.  After all, the Fantastic Four became "the world's greatest comic" simply BECAUSE the characterisations were complex and unique, and the characters each had strong identities.  This is ignored a bit in favour of an Irwin Allen "Land of the Giants" TV feel.  Meaning: these are not epic characters on the level of the X-men.<br /><br />Dr Doom's development was somewhat of a disappointment.  While I enjoyed how the new scriptwriters have incorporated him in a more contemporary and intelligent way - I wish that the original character could've been respected.  The mystery and dark foreboding of the original Dr Doom was on a level that inspired characters like Darth Vader.  Doom's comic book legacy deserved better.<br /><br />The Human Torch however, is excellent.  Never my favourite character, he nonetheless comes alive in every way in the film.  Flame on!<br /><br />The DVD itself is chock full of extras which I'm still wading thru.  3.5 stars for the film; 4.5 for the DVD packaging.<br /><br />There's more to come...a pretty good start.</p></body></html>

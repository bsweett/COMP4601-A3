Much could be edited but then, maybe that is what you need in order to survive the  violence of the film.  'Blood Diamond' takes place in 1999 Sierra Leone, when the country is involved in a civil war. It is difficult at times to decide which side is the most evil; the government or the rebels. It is the innocent farmers caught in between the fighting who pay the price. Diamonds, one of the country's largest moneymakers, are being smuggled out and purchased on the open market, There is a ban on purchasing these 'blood diamonds', but merchants prevail.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy, Djimon Hounsan, is a farmer. He educates his son for a better life. And then one day the rebels capture his son. Solomon is sent to sift for diamonds, and he  finds a 100-karat pink diamond. He meets a soldier of fortune, Danny Archer, Leonardo DiCaprio, who makes a deal for the diamond. Archer will help him find his wife and children for the diamond. They meet an American journalist, Maddy Brown, Jennifer Connelly, who agrees to help them if she can write about their experiences.  The violence and the bloodshed are so real and caused me to close my eyes. The boy solders who are taught to kill are so real and evil. Blood Diamond is as effective in depicting the corruption of innocent people as it is in showing the hell of war. It also highlights greed and manipulation.<br /><br />"Archer. Leonardo DiCaprio, has the most complete role. Thankfully, he never loses his "me first" attitude, but we come to understand how it has developed and we see a gradual softening of some of his morals. It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of "gritty" role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in The Departed. This is not the same actor who set young female hearts aflutter ten years ago. He has discovered a measure of gravitas. Solomon's passion drives the movie forward; when Blood Diamond has urgency, it's because of him. Djimon Hounsou is volcanic in this role." James Berardinelli<br /><br />This could have been the movie of the year were it not for the length and the tediousness of the first 45 minutes. The movie grabbed me for the last hour. It was rivieting and the story one that needs to be told. The message, other than the sory of civil war and the diamond trade, is that Leonardo Di Caprio has found his measure.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 6-03-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a></p></body></html>

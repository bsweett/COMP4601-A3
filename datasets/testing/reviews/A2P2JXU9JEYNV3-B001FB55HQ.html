So the Blu-Ray edition had a director's cut, so the DVD didn't have extras. So all the folk who saw it at the theaters were stupid?<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" is first and foremost, a Sci-Fi film (which means that it most likely will play fast and loose with things like physics, technical jargon, weapons with an unlimited supply of ammunition, among others. All three of the previous films of the franchise did the same thing (but it didn't stop any of the grousers from seeing it, anyway).<br /><br />The story is only a snippet of the story of John Connor, meaning the franchise has a looooong way to go yet. I happen to like the "new" terminators (and there were a bunch!) introduced, and the pace was lightning quick, meaning I had to watch certain segments over, to get full effect. Yes, the acting was two-dimensional at times, but this is a Sci-Fi/Action film, and considering Schwartzeneggar's portrayals in the first three films, not unexpected. Still, the film doesn't suffer because of this. The story is still engrossing for those devotees of the franchise.<br /><br />It's funny that with the exception of Christian Bale, the better known actors like Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander were relegated to what were essentially bit parts. It's sad, too, because Jane Alexander is such a wonderful actress! The rest are relative unknowns, with maybe Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog) and Bryce Dallas Howard being notable exceptions. Still, the performances were good.<br /><br />I won't go into specific details of the story, as there are many here who just had to jump on their computer to get their reviews in FAST, so as to lay it bare, thinking they were doing us all a favor. Suffice to say, "Terminator:Salvation" is as good a Sci-Fi/Action film as you are likely to see, until maybe...."Avatar".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Proper Retelling of Renowned Werewolf Tale"></head><body><p>I approached this film with a lot of trepidition before watching it.  Knowing Rick Baker did the creature effects I thought he was going to resurrect his cheesy work from "An American Werewolf In London".  Secondly, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker did a third rate job with "Sleepy Hollow" and I was expecting more of the same.  Thirdly I have a low tolerance for gore unless it's in the service of a good movie.  Lastly, I have an affinity for the 1941 film with Lon Chaney Jr.  Curt Siodmark's script for that film brilliantly and economically relates the sad fate of the doomed Larry Talbot.  Director Joe Johnson has allayed my fears, however.  His film not only lovingly references the original but there are some definite Hammer film influences here.  Walker's script not only expands the themes from the 1941 film but gives Lawrence Talbot a plausible backstory.  Benicio Del T oro is nothing short of brilliant as the ill-fated Talbot as is Anthony Hopkins as his estranged and enigmatic father.  I also liked the winsome Emily Blunt who is torn between saving the man but killing the beast inside the man.  It may take a strong stomache of sorts to sit through "The Wolfman" but you will be mesmerized by this retelling of this revered classic.</p></body></html>

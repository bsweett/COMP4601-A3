The finest part of the film was the casting, and the ability of the director to draw out an excellent ensemble synergy. No one person in the cast stands out, and all slip right into the skin of their personal dysfunctional character like hand in glove.<br /><br />The nuclear family in the story, of Albuquerque, is headed by Kinnear as Richard, the developer of a "self-help" routine that he's trying to sell, wife Sheryl (Collette), stepson Dwayne (Paul Dano, brilliantly cast as a misfit teen, a devotee of the combination of Nietzche and the Air Force) and young 7 year old Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has not yet been touched by the pessimistic air of the family, and who is the vital force that keeps them all moving forward. Breslin is perhaps the finest part of the film (she has appeared before, in "Signs").<br /><br />For the "road trip" on which the film centers, the family is trying to get Olive to Redondo Beach, CA for a young girl's pageant know as Little Miss Sunshine. It's not clear why Olive is fixated on the pageant, but the family pulls out all the stops to go. In doing so, they can't leave behind their houseguests, Richard's father (Alan Arkin as Grandpa) who was thrown out of assisted living for shooting heroin, and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell), who has recently lost his tenured position, his lover and has tried to commit suicide. This is not a laugh out loud role for Carrell, and it's excellent to see the bittersweet side of him.<br /><br />Along the trip, there are many challenges that would have sent a family less devoted to their daughter back home again...there's a great scene with ice cream in a diner...but nothing tops the family's reaction when they get to the pageant. Given the recent developments in the JonBenet case, and the endless fascination the public has with those shots of JonBenet in her "glam" pageants, the bizarre competition that Olive faces in the person of many little girls aged well beyond their youth is startling.<br /><br />Olive's been working on the talent portion of the competition with her grandfather, and her talent is completely inappropriate and hilarious. The support she receives from her family, however, shows that even the most dysfunctional families can pull together in a crisis, and grow from it.<br /><br />Without giving away any more of the film, I'll tell you that you will find "Little Miss Sunshine" metaphorical and sweet at some turns, laugh out loud at others. What more can you ask from a comedy?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="fabulous new 40th Anniversary edition is one to treasure..."></head><body><p>This lovely new 40th Anniversary 2-disc edition of THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a real treat.  But, for those in a quandry about buying yet another DVD release of the film (following the "Five Star" 2-disc edition), I say, buy this version but keep the old one too, because it has some great extras that were not ported onto this new edition (more about that later).<br /><br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is of course based on the long-running 1959 hit Broadway musical that originally starred Mary Martin.  The musical was inspired by a Geman film called "Die Trapp Famile", based on the book by Maria Augusta Trapp.  The story is as well-known as those hills that truly did come alive with the sound of music:  Maria (Julie Andrews) is a postulant nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg circa 1938.  The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) becomes well-aware that the spirited Maria is hardly suited to the cloistered life of a nun.  So Maria is assigned as governess to the seven children of an autocratic widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer).  Like a breath of fresh mountain air, Maria transforms the children and eventually steals the Captain's heart away from a worldly Baroness (Eleanor Parker).  But the Nazi Anschluss is coming, and the family's safety is under threat...<br /><br />This new DVD contains a wealth of new bonus material including :<br />"Audio Commentary" - brand new commentary track with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, choreographer Dee Dee Wood and Charmian Carr amongst others.  The Robert Wise director commentary (from the "5 Star" release) is also included.<br /><br />"A Few of My Favourite Things" - Julie Andrews hosts this generous-length documentary which features new interviews with key cast and production team members, some rare photos, footage from behind the scenes and more.<br /><br />"Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence" - Julie and Chris sit down and share their memories from the film.<br /><br />"From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion" - This is something truly special.  This segment reunites all seven von Trapp children to share their own memories and talk about the film.  With Charmian Carr (Liesl), Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich), Heather Menzies (Louisa), Duane Chase (Kurt), Angela Cartwright (Brigitta), Debbie Turner (Marta) and Kym Karath (Gretl).<br /><br />"On Location with The Sound of Music" - Charmian Carr takes us on a personally-guided tour of Salzburg, taking in the historical sites as well as the locations featured in the film.  This is a cute update on "Salzburg Sights and Sounds", which Carr made as a featurette during production of SOM in 1965 (and which can be found on the "5 Star" release).<br /><br />"When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon" - This takes a look behind the scenes during the 40th Anniversary "Sing-Along a-Sound of Music" screening held at the Hollywood Bowl with an audience of over 18,00 people.  The "Sing Along" version of the film has taken off all over the world, and this featurette gives you a definite flavour of one.<br /><br />"The von Trapp Family: Harmony and Discord" - This is the fantastic `Biography' episode which takes an in-depth look at the real von Trapp clan.  We learn that the real Maria was a far more flawed and fallible human being than we ever saw in "Sound of Music", and also the shocking fact that infamous Himmler took over the von Trapp villa shortly after their exit from Salzburg.  Featuring interviews with several of the real von Trapp children.<br /><br />"Mia Farrow screen test" - A fascinating look at the girl who might have played Liesl if Charmian Carr was never cast in the role.  Farrow sings a brief section of "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" in a blonde wig.  Lesley Ann Warren also auditioned for the role (she appeared in the title role of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" instead), but it might have been nice to have had Lesley's screen test also.  Oh well...<br /><br />"Restoration comparison" - Compares a 1993 print of the film with the new 40th Anniversary restored print.<br /><br />There are also copious trailers and galleries to watch and explore.<br /><br />The "Five Star" double disc set also included the fabulous doco "From Fact to Phenomenon", and that is the main reason why I'll keep my old DVD alongside this new version.  I recommend that all fans purchase this new edition, if only for the reunion featurette.  For those who have yet to buy SOM in digital format, this release is a no-brainer.</p></body></html>

In fact, this could be one of the most important films to grace the silver screen in a long time, yet I won't give it the full five stars for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First of all, Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, should be commended for what he has done here. This is a sharp, well produced and well choreographed film. Despite it's ugliness, it's a beautiful film.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is all gloom and doom. The youngest person on the planet has been assasinated. He was 18. There hasn't been a pregnancy on earth in years. The earth's human population is doomed. The world is in turmoil. Countries are in flames. Unrest is rampant. Terrorism is running wild.<br /><br />The color schemes are all grey and drab. Yet, despite all the ugliness and the grey sceneries. The camera shots are brilliant and beautiful. Cuar&oacute;n shot the film in a documentary style. It's as if you the viewer are running along side Theo Faron (Clive Owen) as he unwillingly falls into a save the world scenario. The violence is real and in your face. The explosions are gut churning and duck inspiring. What Cuar&oacute;n did with the camera in this film, WILL, without question, set a new standard for future films. More action films will be shot this way and I can't wait.<br /><br />So, why only 4 stars for such an important film. Oh, just a couple of things. First of all, the movie, story-wise, is a little one dimensional and anti-climatic. I won't give away anything, but I was hoping for more as the story played itself out.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie rests on the shoulders of a premise that a baby hasn't been born in nearly twenty-years and the human race has accepted its fate as doomed. In my humble opinion, that is slightly tough to swallow. If the human race is so void of humanity, as the movie suggests, I would think that sometime in those eighteen years, somebody would decide and okay the use of CLONING. Just a thought.<br /><br />Despite the downfalls, CHILDREN OF MEN, is not to be missed. Brilliant film. Turn up your surround sound and enjoy because this is what making movies is all about and don't forget the name Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, cause you're gonna hear it again.</p></body></html>

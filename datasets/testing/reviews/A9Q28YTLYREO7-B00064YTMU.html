<meta name="summary" content="interesting film"></head><body><p>Jamie Foxx&Tom Crusie have real good chemistry in this film that feels sometimes like a virtual Reality film in spots.Michael Mann does a Good job here with the pacing after a while. Jada Pinkett Smith ain't bad. 04 was Brother Foxx's Year. He was on Point in all his works last year.Tom Crusie was cool in this film though certain things didn't make sense,but overall the film was cool.</p></body></html>

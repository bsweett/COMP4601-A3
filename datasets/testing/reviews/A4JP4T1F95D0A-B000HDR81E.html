In general, the movie is a fairly good showcase of Vaughn comedy with Aniston serving as the serious one.  The movie is of course about a couple breaking up and the crazy things they do while trying not to be the first to admit that it was a mistake.  It's not boring, but it is not overly engaging.  It would have been a nice black comedy like War of the Roses if they had just taken things a little further.  The ending at least is not the typical Hollywood feel good ending.  Overall, it is a decent thing to rent, but I would hold off on buying it unless you are a huge fan of the two leads.</p></body></html>

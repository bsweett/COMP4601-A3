As a friend of mine often says, "It is what it is".  Meaning take it for what it is because we can't always have what we want and we must use what we have.  Even survivalist will find some of it daunting.  Perhaps the cold and hunger affects their judgement because there are some mistakes made.  But then even in the best of conditions people prove they are only human every day.  Some perhaps expect perfect heroes that have all the answers, and they aren't in this movie.<br /><br />I enjoy survival movies and even with movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7J9LM">Eight Below [Blu-ray</a>] that don't have the happiest of endings, you learn from the journey.  You will learn from it and Liam Neeson gives a magnificent performance.  He has perfected his craft and does a wonderful job of pulling us into this cruel wilderness that he must try to survive after a plane crash leaves him and a handful of passenegers alive and surrounded by giant gray wolves.  If you find yourself skeptical of their decisions or the wolves, I'd say you haven't done that much camping in the wild or you aren't familiar with this variety that kills for sport.  Not a day goes by when even smart people make the dumbest decisions that should make them candidates for the Darwin Awards.<br /><br />Keep in mind this group of survivors has no weapons, only fire to keep the wolves off them.  Add to that most of them are bleeding, and predators like wolves can certainly sense fear as well.  If you're still skeptical of the wolves size and behavior let me tell you I was until I found out it's not unrealistic at all.  I found articles about the large wolf packs in Canada that came from the introduction of 35 large Canadian gray wolves into Idaho and Yellowstone in Wyoming.  So those that tell you wolves aren't like this are basing their opinion on the smaller wolf varieties that were indigenous previously and now thought to be extinct in the United States.  Large packs of gray wolves are now roaming Northern US and they are aggressive enough to have not only attacked livestock, but humans in ever increasing numbers.  I recommend you see the movie if you enjoy movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FDWAXM">Alive</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDWE2">The Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray</a>].<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

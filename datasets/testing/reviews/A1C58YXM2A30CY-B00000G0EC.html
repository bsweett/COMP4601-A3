<meta name="summary" content="Cretaceous Park?  Great Spielberg Film!"></head><body><p>Spielberg's Jurassic Park was for the most part a revolutionary film, mixing the then-new CGI with traditional model effects to bring us dinosaurs.  The nitpickers might complain that the dinosaurs were all from the Cretaceous period.  Still, it won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction film for a reason.<br /><br />You know the plot:  a rich philanthropist, John Hammond, has found that cloning dinosaurs is a reality and decides to introduce the world to this phenomena by making a park that will entertain the rich masses to his little island.<br /><br />Everything is fine until we find the fat computer programmer is actually trying to sell dinosaur embryos to the highest bidder (Dennis Nedry, played by Wayne Knight, from Seinfeld).  In trying to escape and get his goods off the island and get his money (in the middle of a hurricane, no less) he shuts down the park's security system.<br /><br />This shut down then leads to massive failure of the electric fence system and many of the dinosaurs get out -- and begin their mass destruction of the human's activities!<br /><br />The movie's main draw for me was the actual dinosaurs live on screen.  You knew that one of the characters was correct -- this was nature's power and she decided to have the dinosaurs up for extinction and yet Man brought them back is looking for trouble -- but to see them grazing, running, herding and killing each other was really thrilling!<br /><br />Much of the book's charm and character development was cut out of the script, written fairly well by Michael Crichton (who also wrote the novel) and David Koepp.<br /><br />The DVD also had some great features, including a fascinating "making of" and the decisions to use computer-animation techniques and meld them with traditional model techniques was fascinating, as well as an interview with Spielberg and what was going through is mind in shooting this film.  His excitement and interest over the project was fascinating.  A director's enthusiasm often translates to the crew and cast and this was evident in the film.<br /><br />The film achieves the "awe and wonder" that other reviewers have stated, but is missing the development of character that is very evident in Crichton's original novel.  Still, well worth watching<br /><br />Other Spielberg Films of Interest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QCYC">Jurassic Park Trilogy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9Q">E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (2-Disc Widescreen Limited Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br />And of course books of interest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345370775">Jurassic Park</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/034538122X">The Making of Jurassic Park</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600107605">Jurassic Park</a></p></body></html>

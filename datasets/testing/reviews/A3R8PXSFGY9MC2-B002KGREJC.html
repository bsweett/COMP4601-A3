<meta name="summary" content="Juno"></head><body><p>'Juno' manages to achieve exactly what it set out to be, a feel good, inoffensive, funny film. It manages to mix hilarious, laugh out loud moments, with more poignant moments and Ellen Page has an ability to deliver dialogue in a way that will make you smile even before the punchline. The first half is the funniest, where as the second half becomes a touch more serious as it resolves the issue of the film, Juno's teenage pregnancy. The soundtrack is great (so much so I bought it) and compliments the various scenes perfectly. I didn't expect to enjoy this quite as much as I did and for that reason alone it was a happy surprise. There are mixed reviews for his film here, but if you want an easy going film, that is excellently acted, with great music and with an interesting enough storyline, then this is the place to go. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

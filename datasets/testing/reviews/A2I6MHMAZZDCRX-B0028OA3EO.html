<meta name="summary" content="Superman Needed a Little Less to His Return"></head><body><p>I must admit, I only have a working knowledge of Superman.  I haven't seen the previous movies or the various TV shows.  Still, I know who all the characters are and was quite anxious to see this movie.  While that means I missed out of some cool cameos, I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />For five years, the world has been without Superman (Brandon Routh).  Now, he's come back to Earth and is ready to pick up where he left off.<br /><br />Fortunately, his alter ego, Clark Kent, is able to get his old job back at The Daily Planet.  While Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is thrilled to see him back, his reunion with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is very chilly.  During the last five years, she's moved on with her life.  She has a son (Tristan Lake Leabu) and is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden).  Seeing Superman again stirs up old feelings within her, so she's not exactly thrilled to be assigned to cover him again.<br /><br />Meanwhile, old nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has just been released from prison.  He's already planning his next bid for world domination.  It involves crystals, kryptonite, and creating land.  Will Superman figure out what he's up to in time to stop him?<br /><br />The movie is two and a half hours long, and unfortunately it feels it.  The first part of the movie is very slow with back story even this newbie didn't need.  Once the story got going, it was interesting and held my interest through the end, which again dragged on for a scene or two more then necessary.<br /><br />Much has been made of casting an unknown in the roll.  I liked Brandon Routh in the lead.  He has a commanding presence as Superman.  Kevin Spacey was great as well.  His Luthor was equal parts fun and menace.  The only real problem was Kate Bosworth.  She did a great job, but she looked too young for the part.  For this story to work, the actress playing Lois needed to be at least thirty, and Kate isn't.<br /><br />And, of course, there are the special effects, which are incredible and flawlessly fit into the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie, but not the great movie I had hoped it would be.</p></body></html>

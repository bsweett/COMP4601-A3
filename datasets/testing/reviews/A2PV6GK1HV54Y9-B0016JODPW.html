Directed by Sidney Lument, this drama will definitely catch your eye especially after the first scene and the bank robbery that goes terribly wrong. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a blistering, unsympathetic peformance...he is without a doubt the finest, most gifted actor to light up the screen in years! Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney also deliver flawless peformances. There is not one negative thing about this movie, amazing piece of art!</p></body></html>

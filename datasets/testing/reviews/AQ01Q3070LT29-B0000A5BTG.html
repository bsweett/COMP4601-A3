It offers you a choice if you want to see previews or just go right to the main menu.  The core of the earth is slowing down and it is causing alot of disasterous phenomenon.  Sudden traffic accidents, birds flying and hitting every thing in sight.  Even the space shuttle has a problem.  They must suddenly touchdown in Los Angeles.  The Los Angeles River that is.  A space shuttle pilot and a professor and others in a probe-like craft must go inside the Earth and reach the core to fix the problem.  If the core should stop, the results would be horrific...death.  Total fantasy of couse, but might be fun to watch.  DVD includes deleted scenes and extended scenes.</p></body></html>

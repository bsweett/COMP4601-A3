Filmmaker Luc Jaquet and crew spent a year in Antarctica to chronicle the "nesting" part of the Emperor Penguin's complicated life cycle. He picked up a flock of hundreds of Emperors as they arrived along the Antarctica coast and followed them inland 70-80 miles as they marched single file in their stiff, awkward, upright fashion to their winter breeding grounds. Any food they needed was carried inside them. When they arrived at their predetermined locality they laid their eggs and then protected them through the long bitter winter season. It was an amazing sight. Even more amazing was the realization that a human crew had been there filming the whole thing in the inky darkness and with temperatures that ranged down into the minus 120s.<br /><br />Evidently, the penguins didn't seem to mind the film crew and they went about the somewhat humorous antics of their strange lives in this forsaken place. Well, at least they didn't have to worry much about predators sneaking up on them. About halfway through this saga, one of each breeding pair returned to the ocean to load up on additional food. At just about the time that the winter ice sheet  began to melt, the offspring were ready and journied with their parents back to the ocean to start the life cycle over again.<br /><br />Jaquet and crew presented an amazing story. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job of narrating the film. They presented us with a window into the lives of creatures with which we would have no way of crossing paths, other than viewing them in cages at Sea World or something like that. The film is very interesting, entertaining, funny and educational all at the same time. Well done! Amazing!</p></body></html>

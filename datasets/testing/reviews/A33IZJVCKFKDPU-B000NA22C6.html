<meta name="summary" content="disappointed"></head><body><p>I was really hoping that this movie was going to be good.  I really wanted this movie to be good.  Maybe I just set my standards too high.  I mean sure Johnny Depp is in the movie, (and carried the whole movie, again) but how many horror movies like these are really good?  This movie makes one less.<p>This movie had a ton of flaws.  I can't really tell what they are without ruining the "surprise" ending.  Just take my word that there were many flaws.  SPOILER ALERT:  The ending was very similar to Idenity and I really do not like those endings.  Maybe because I can't understand how it is all possible, if you've seen Identity you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />The movie moved very slowly and the thing that I was most disappointed in was the fact that the movie just wasn't scary at all.  I was laughing at Depp's antics more than I was feeling frightened at plot developments.  <p>There were a few things that I liked.  I like the way the movie ended, not the surprise ending, but the way the story ended.  Mainly because it is something that you rarely see in movies.  Also Depp was very entertaining.  I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars, but I like Johnny Depp so I will give it three.</p></body></html>

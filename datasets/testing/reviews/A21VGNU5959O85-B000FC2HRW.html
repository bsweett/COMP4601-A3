They have all been entertaining, gory, and clever but the charm has finally worn off for me personally. The acting has never been first rate, horror movies rarely offer Oscar worthy performances. The formula has always been followed, someone gets a vision saves others from a terrible fate than one by one they all hand in their "get out of death " free card to the grim reaper. The main characters must figure out the order of death, and maybe cheat it making it skip and therefore end the cycle completely. By this third movie, it seemed to me the kill scenes were just getting a bit forced and completely unbelievable even for a supernatural causation. The tanning beds, the nail gun, the motor chopping off heads, and the exercise equipment were just off from the first two movies genius. The extra feature where you can decide their fate with your remote was a waste of time, I don't understand even putting it on there unless they really had changed some of the fates (besides the one dude with the stupid hat , which when saved just disappears and it makes no sense) I have read other reviews on here, and I have to agree with whomever pointed out that the pictures before the rollercoaster shouldn't have showed their grim fates, if they all were supposed to die on the ride, Did death know she would save them? If so than that changes everything, its not really cheating death than is it? Oh well, anyway, watch this if you have some free time, and if you liked the first two, its an okay , hopefully the end to this played out series.</p></body></html>

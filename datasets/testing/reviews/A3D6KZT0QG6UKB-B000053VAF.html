<meta name="summary" content="Good movie. Not great, but definitely enjoyable"></head><body><p>Ironic that this movie is condemned by the Catholic League since everything in it is extremely Catholic. Almost every seminary student should watch this thing. Pretty much the story about bitter angels trying  to get into Heaven follows the same theological conundrum posed by the  Prophecy (ie, G-d's messengers really hate the human race) but it is  extremely silly for the most part.<p>Cute scenes in the movie include the  blessed golf clubs, the whole &quot;angels can't have sex&quot; scenes,  Alanis Morrisette as G-d, and the poop monster.<p>Strengths include Chris  Rock, Alan Rickman as well as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as the angels. Jay  &amp; Silent Bob are funny but most of their jokes were in the comic books  already (including going to the town where all the John Hughes movies took  place to pick up Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy). George Carlin is  hilarious but that's mostly because he's George Carlin.<p>Irritating parts  of the movie included the hockey playing demons, the demon character and  Linda Fiorentino's character (Smith still can't write female characters  very well, but at least he's trying unlike Mamet who just sticks a woman in  the movie for no reason whatsoever.)<p>And I was personally disturbed by  the fact that Salma Hayak's character was a sexless angel. But that's just  my personal problem and doesn't really detract from the movie. Hayak is  either really irritating or really good in movies (pretty much mostly  Rodriguez movies is where she shines.) and in this one she's pretty  good.<p>So rent it out or buy it. It's a fun movie. Just don't expect the  greatest movie ever made. Kevin Smith may one day direct an amazingly  beautiful and deep movie, but for now he directs enjoyable comedies which  shouldn't be taken as anything more.<p>Oh yeah, I kinda have to agree on  the camera angle thing too. Nothing in this movie is all that visually  interesting, but there were some nice shots and it is getting better.</p></body></html>

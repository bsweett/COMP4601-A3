<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing Classic"></head><body><p>In many ways, director John Frankenheimer's 1962 film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE could be considered the first modern political thriller, dealing as it does with the Cold War, the twin threats of Communism and Fascism, and much, much more.<br /><br />Based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel, this masterpiece of suspense and savage political satire focuses on a decorated Korean war hero (Laurence Harvey) who is known for being a cold fish and being manipulated by his politically far-right wing mother (Angela Lansbury, in a performance FAR removed from "Murder She Wrote" and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST).  But a fellow Korean war vet (Frank Sinatra) suspects, because of nightmares he's had, that Harvey may have been brainwashed while both of them were POWs on the Manchurian front.  This leads to all sorts of political machinations, culminating in a climax that was so disturbing to Sinatra (because it had too many parallels to the real-life nightmare played out in Dallas in November 1963) that he had this film removed from circulation for almost a quarter century.<br /><br />Indeed, time has been very good to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, despite the end of the Cold War and the recent, and very good, remake of it with Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, and Meryl Streep.  Sinatra gives probably his best performance as an actor apart from the classic FROM HERE TO ETERNITY under Frankenheimer's incisive direction and George Axelrod's carefully crafted screenplay.  Harvey does a very good job of playing an easily manipulated man; and Lansbury's performance, as mentioned, is absolutely savage.  The chilling implications of brainwashing, humiliation, and political manipulation raised in this film are as important today as they were in the dark days of the Cold War and the anti-communist hysteria of those times, which makes THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE a disturbing classic.</p></body></html>

I really don't know why they decided to use hand puppets for the characters.  Their faces are expressionless for the most part, and it gives off a really creepy vibe, which I don't think was the intention.  The film is a bit dated already, as many targets of its satire are not newsmakers anymore.  Many in the future will watch this film in utter bewilderment, as they will not have the context to understand it, because all of its satire is topical.  Of course, there are gross out jokes (it wouldn't be a Trey and Matt if there wasn't).  I did like some of the satire.  There's a very funny moment at a meeting of "FAG" (really childish name) where the Janeane Garofalo hand puppet says "we should be allowed to read news headlines and pretend they're our own words".  Janeane recently appeared on Bill Maher's show, and she said "Bush is the new Saddam".  This was an actual headline from a Canadian newspaper recently, so I thought the sequence was rather amusing.  In fairness to Janeane, she doesn't do this all the time, but it's still worth noting.  But too often these incisive satiric moments like that are few and far between, and the film relies on gross out humour, bad jokes, monotonic dialogue, and just lazy writing.  The South Park movie was funnier and more interesting.</p></body></html>

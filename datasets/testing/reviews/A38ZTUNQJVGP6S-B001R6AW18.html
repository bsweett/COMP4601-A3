With the 60th Anniversary edition, there is an extra 25 minutes of documentary about the making of King Kong. This is one of the best monster movies of all times. It has everything; drama, the damsel in distress, King Kong fight different dinosaurs, the adventurer, lost live, big ape falling in love with blonde woman, and a touch of comedy to go with it. The best part about this movie is the special effects. For its day was high tech. This is a must for any monster\ape fan.</p></body></html>

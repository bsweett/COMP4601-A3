<meta name="summary" content="Training Day is awesome"></head><body><p>I can say that the film has no flaws. Also Ethan Hawke's characters is not subdued, in fact, Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt) while being sensitive and moral, is at the same intense level as Denzel Washington's.<br /><br />You can't write a review, without describing the plot.<br /><br />The story is very real and vivid. It concerns a rookie cop named<br />Jake Hoyt (Hawke) who is assigned to a veteran narcotics cop named Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).<br /><br />During hia first few days on the job. Hoyr observes how Harris does his job of busting crooks and drug dealers. Alonzo is like a Dirty Harry movie, everyone in the city knows who he is and is scared to death of the gritty cop.<br /><br />However, underneath, that great cop lies a crooked, corrupt policeman who is playing both sides of the law.... This is Denzel Washington best role ever, and he won the Oscar over Russell Crowe for best actor and it was well deserved.<br /><br />Denzel through Alonzo creates another memorable corrupt villain<br />in film history.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is also great as Jake Hoyt. In fact both actors were nominated for their roles in the movie.<br /><br />I just checked out the DVD, and it's absolutely fantastic!!!<br /><br />The alternate ending is actually almost identical to the original ending, the making of features are great though along<br />with the candid commentary by Antoine Fuqua.<br /><br />It was the movie of the year in 2001 and still holds up as corrupt law enforcement is still alive today.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I probably shouldn't have seen this film a second time."></head><body><p>Tombstone is an interesting film in that it came out at the same time as the superior (I feel) Wyatt Earp.  I saw Tombstone first, and although I thought it to be a good movie with a great, and often funny, performance  from Val Kilmer, I felt the film was uneven (I didn't like it near as much  the second time around).  Russell is solid as the stone-faced lawman, but  the representation of Ringo and the Clantons seemed typical  Hollywood.<p>Unlike Wyatt Earp (which tries to be an epic--showing the  life of the famous lawman), Tombstone centers only around the time he and  his brothers moved to that Arizona town.  As noted in the other reviews of  both films, it's surprising Hollywood chose to show the shootings of Morgan  and Virgil Earp on the same evening and not months apart as had actually  happened (probably due to movie length constrants).  Between 1 and 10, I  give Tombstone a solid 6.  It's well worth the rental or purchase, if for  no other reason than seeing Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday.</p></body></html>

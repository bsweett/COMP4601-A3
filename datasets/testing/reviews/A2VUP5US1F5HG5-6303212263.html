My Dad took me to see this when it first came out in the 70s, and the years haven't dimmed this gem one bit.  Reeve, of course, is perfectly cast as the orphan from the stars who will become Earth's greatest hero.  Margot Kidder is a wonderful Lois Lane, and Gene Hackman has a ball as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor.  Marlon Brano's Jor-El lends a powerful authority to the opening scenes on doomed Krypton, and his lingering presence haunts the rest of the movie much as his spirit does Kal-El.  Funny, touching, and suspenseful in exactly the right touches (well, Lois Lane's mid-flight poety recital might be a bit much), &quot;Superman:  The Movie&quot; is for everyone who was ever a kid, and every boy who ever wanted to fly like Superman.</p></body></html>

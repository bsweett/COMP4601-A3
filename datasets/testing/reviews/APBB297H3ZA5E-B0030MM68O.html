<meta name="summary" content="Ok Movie? Kind of.  Deserving of Academy Award?  100% No"></head><body><p>1.  As in most cases, the intellectual elite, the critics et al just don't get it.  This is no better exemplified with all the hoopla that surrounded this movie.  I'm not a combat vet from the Iraq war, but I've spent my time in the military and this is just another one of those... pseudo documentary military movies with a definite left-leaning perspective on things that basically is based more on the fantasy of those so called sophisticated folks who write / create these movies than "reality."  With that being said, I would be ok with it if the movie just wasn't... so boring.  I mean, where's the "story",  where's the character development.  I'm probably expecting a little too much from movies these days... such as being semi-entertained and enlightened .  With this movie, you'll get neither... for the most part.<br /><br />2.  In summary, save your precious bucks and buy... a decent burger or something.  You'll get more enjoyment and enlightenment out of that compared to watching this dud.</p></body></html>

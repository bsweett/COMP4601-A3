<meta name="summary" content="LOW TIDE FOR OCEAN"></head><body><p>Look, I know these movies are stupid vanity projects, but I really enjoyed Oceans 11 and 12, the guys seemed to be having fun and it was light(and I do mean light)entertainment, but this one is just lazy and nobody seems to be having the least amount of fun, the least of which is the audience.  I mean Pitt keeps looking at his watch as if to say, shouldnt I be picking up Angela's teddy from the dry cleaner?  Really, all of the actors in this film should be ashamed to cash their hefty checks, this is totally mailed in.  Pacino is totally wasted and the plot, as if their ever really is one in these stupid movies, is totally convoluted, I mean what the f is Eddie Lizzard even talking about, you shouldnt need a degree in macro physics to figure out a movie plot.  I dont recommend this movie in the least, frankly id like the two hours of my life back wasted on this inane tripe.</p></body></html>

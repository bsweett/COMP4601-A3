A film with this exact formula that immediately leaps to mind is "Total Recall."  As with that film the action sequences in "I, Robot" are thoughtfully produced and numerous, the special effects are excellent and extensive, and the one-liners are frequent and humerous.  Will Smith has obviously been hitting the weight room in perperation for his new Action Hero status, and his charming demeanor is still present throughout.  While there are scenes that are ridiculously violent to the point where any mere human could not simply stagger away through the aftermath of destruction, a severe concussion being the least of his injuries, this is Science Fiction, after all.  I have to admit that I went in expecting this movie to be average, at best.  I've read many reviews, both here and from professional critics, panning this film as a grandiose bomb.  I disagree.  This is an entertaining film with a flashy production value and an altogether charismatic leading man.  The fact that this film was directed by Alex Proyas ("The Crow" and "Dark City") never entered into my decision to watch it.  However, I enjoyed "The Crow," and "Dark City" is easily one of the most underrated Science Fiction films of all time.  It wasn't until the ending credits were unveiled did I know he had directed this film, as well.  Had I known I never would have hesitated to see it.  Remember the three laws: action, special effects, and one-liners.  All are necessary in creating an entertaining Science Fiction film; and all are present here.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

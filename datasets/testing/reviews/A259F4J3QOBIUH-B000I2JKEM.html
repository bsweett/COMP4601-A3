I noted countless reasons to watch the movie again, because some scenes are filled with a myriad of images and activities which keep the eyes moving over the screen.  The story is great, and the animation is fantastic!<br /><br />I have been informed, by a Costume Designer with an Art/Design degree, that I should definitely watch the Bonus materials, as well.  I have not seen those aspects, yet, but they get a great review from the Designer.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and look forward to seeing it again.</p></body></html>

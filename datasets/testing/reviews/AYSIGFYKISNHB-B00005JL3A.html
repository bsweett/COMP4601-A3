<meta name="summary" content="Unworthy Of The Name Resident Evil"></head><body><p>Since I am a fan of the game, I see all the many flaws in this fake version of a film pretending to be Resident Evil. When I heard that Anderson was writing and directing this film, I thought it could be close to the game since he did a good job directing Mortal Kombat, and did a good job writing Shopping. But when I heard that none of the charcters or much of the game's elements are not in this film, I knew trouble was ahead.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich playes Alice, an employee of Umbrella Corp. who doesn't remember anything after being exposed to knockout gas. She goes with soldiers to the hive that's under the mansion. When they get there, all the workers in the hive are dead. While trying to turn off the Red Queen, the dead workers become undead because of the T-Virus that gets loose in the hive.<br /><br />The characters in this film are dull and boring. Rain (Rodriquez) and J.D. (Aleardi) are nothing more than a Vasquez and Drake ripoff from Aliens. The gore is so PG-13,this film is onlt "R" for language and the little nudity.<br /><br />This film was the beginning of Anderson being a liar. He lied about a much gorier version coming on DVD. No version of that came out. However, he did told the truth in Fangoria issue #211 about the script of this film is just a homage to the game he wrote before he got the job. That would explain why it's really nothing like the game.<br /><br />Another lie from him is that he says it's based before the mansion situation in the original game. Well, if that's true, where's Rebecca, Forest, Kenneth and a few other that were in that mansion before S.T.A.R.S. arrived?<br /><br />Resident Evil does have good visuals, some good scenes, and a very cool score by Marilyn Manson. This film doesn't bore, doesn't make you go to sleep, doesn't make you look at your watch, but it's not a Resident Evil film. All we're watching is the script Anderson wrote that was turned into Resident Evil. He should've just released the film like that.</p></body></html>

The story a ruthless, but human oil tycoon is compelling, but the ending left me wanting a bit more. The film is beautifully shot and the acting is wonderful, especially Mr. Lewis's portrayal of the main character. It's a long film, but it never feels that way. This may not be my favorite film of the year, but it's darn good!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie"></head><body><p>Special effects are a bit weak, and it is a little dummed down, but this movie will bring back memories for anyone who has been through this kind of weather catastrophe.  It captures the emotions of a real life disaster, life or death situations. <p>It brought back memories of the Oakfield tornado in FDL County, Wisconsin...a weather event I covered for the Fond du Lac radio station KFIZ.  Helen Hunt is excellent in this movie.</p></body></html>

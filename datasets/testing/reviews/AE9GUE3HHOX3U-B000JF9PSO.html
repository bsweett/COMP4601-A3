This film explored on a timeline as close to what happened as possible.  It was both horrifing and fascinating to witness.  It put a human face on the tragedy, other than seeing and hearing news type coverage about it.  It was a throughly engaging film, and at times hard to watch.  I couldn't help but get teary eyed during certain parts, that whole experience was totally tragic and disturbing.  I hope this film can bring some kind of closure or recogintion to the families of the flight 93 victims. They are of course the most important factor of the film and the reason why it was made.  This film should be dedicated in tribute to them, and of course thier loved ones that perished that day.</p></body></html>

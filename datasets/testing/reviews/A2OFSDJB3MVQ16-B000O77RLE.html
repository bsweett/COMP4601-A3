<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's WWII masterwork"></head><body><p>Of the 2 war films that Clint Eastwood directed, "Flags of our Fathers" and "Letters from Iwo Jima", the latter film can qualify as Clint's masterpiece. With restraint and sensitivity, Eastwood has shown us how really futile war is and the sacrifices of the ordinary foot soldier, whether they be Japanese or American.  In some quarters, many critics felt Clint should've taken Best Picture and Best Director but the Academy did finally give an long over-due Oscar to Martin Scorsese for "The Departed".  But who's to say which is the better--like apples and oranges, these 2 films achieved their goals brilliantly. But getting back to "Letters", special mention should be given to the performances here given by Ken Watanabe as the commander and Kazunari Ninomiya as cook turned soldier. Their performances lend a special poignancy to this film as well as the other performers in this film.  The battle scenes are just as powerful as those in "Saving Private Ryan" though one should remember that Spielberg was one of the producer of this film as well.  In HD DVD, these scenes are brilliantly delinerated.  Highly recommeded.</p></body></html>

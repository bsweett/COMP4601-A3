<meta name="summary" content="Nicholson At His Best"></head><body><p>If you've never seen a Jack Nicholson film, or have been repulsed by some of his previous flicks, GO SEE THIS FILM!!!  It is a cinema classic.  Helen Hunt is so sincere, hard, and cute...in this film that reminds me of a Spielberg classic.  It tugs at the strings of your heart.</p></body></html>

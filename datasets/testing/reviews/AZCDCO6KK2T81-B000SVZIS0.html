<meta name="summary" content="Apes Rule!"></head><body><p>I know that remakes are often ill-received (and rightly so all too often), especially by loyalist to the original, but when I read comments on this specific remake that the oscar-winning outstanding make-up is laughable, the acting a joke (through all that make-up by top-notch actors), or that there is nothing original here, I can't help but wonder what film those folks were watching and I have to question the objectivity they may or may not have had going into this film and we all have a bias when entering a remake or a change to an established character.  I know that I had no intention of seeing, let alone liking the new James Bond, Daniel Craig (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNP2KI">Casino Royale</a>), but when I gave him and the film a chance, I was enormously surprised.  I think this film needs a second chance by those who so off-handly dismissed it.<br /><br />I agree 100% with Amazon's review and synopsis of this film.  This remake is rather inventive and original in it's own right and is far closer to the novel than the original.  The themes of racism, civil right, justice, love, and sacrifice are handled far more deeply and sincerely than the original film did although that is still an outstanding film in its own right.  Of course, the make-up in this remake is nothing less than astounding and believable by the famous Rick Bakker and completely outshines the original film.  The special effects are nothing great, but they are good.  The acting, the heart of this film in addition to its literate script, is terrific by those in the ape make-up as their voices, eyes, and gestures must mean more to resonate with the audience because of the heavy make-up used.  I do, however, agree with critics here regarding the casting of Mark Wahlberg who is rather pedestrian in this film.  He simply lacks charisma in this role and I found myself caring very little for him even as the hero in this film.<br /><br />An interesting twist in this film that admittedly annoyed loyalists to the original is that in this film all humans speak, which makes sense to me as why would we "forget" how to speak in the future when the apes take over.  While I always thought that was a silly aspect to the ape film series for none of us to talk in the future, I must admit that it does make the apes seems even crueler when they go after humans that speak.  I guess that only enhances the racism theme prevelant in all the ape films.  After all, we did, sadly enough, considered African slaves to be soul-less and a less form of humans and they were capable of speech too.  In fact, slaves owners only considered them just "property" and not even human.  Again, this concept of having all humans speak in this remake makes the film all the more thought-provoking.  In addition, the short-lived <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GUJZ0K">Planet of the Apes: The Complete TV Series</a> also had all the humans speak.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an extraordinary film and definitely not worthy of the very harsh criticism its recently received although everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.  I just think some need to give this film a second and real chance (minus the bias one may have for the original).  I highly recommend this film as an adventure, sci-fi tale, and message for its timely social commentaries.</p></body></html>

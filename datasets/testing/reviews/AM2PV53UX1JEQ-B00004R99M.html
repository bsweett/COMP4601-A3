<meta name="summary" content="FANTASTIC FANTASY"></head><body><p>To date, it is hard to think of a movie that integrated story, character, musical numbers, animation and live action as enchantingly as Mary Poppins.  For children, no other movie provides the sheer exuberance or delightfully  conveyed good messages.  For adults, there is a Puff The Magic Dragon theme  throughout that comes over you when you watch it as a grown-up; I think it  is that twist of sadness and of time passing by that keeps Mary Poppins on  the top of the list.  Julie Andrews is arch perfection in a role she plays  with no sentiment at all; her Mary is as spit-spot and no-nonsense as in  the books; and again, it is that air of authenticity that wins you over --  completely.  Dick Van Dyke displays his many affable talents here in  spades, and the children are absolutely adorable.  The London locations are  a dream come true, and provide a visual backdrop for the adventures at hand  that keeps unfolding with wit and creativity. Though the final scenes in  the bank do drag on a bit, this movie is whisked along by some of the  Sherman Brothers' best music, which conveys not only spirited fun and  frivolity, but also sweet melancholy -- Chim Chim Cheree creeps up on you  by surprise, and at its conclusion you are moved to a place of wistfulness.  Joyful and enduring.</p></body></html>

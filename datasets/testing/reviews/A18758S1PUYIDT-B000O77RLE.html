<meta name="summary" content="Soldiers truly are brothers in arms"></head><body><p>Well done but very graphically (and necessarily so) violent film by Clint Eastwood, telling us the story of the battle for this island during WW2---from the Japanese p.o.v.<br /><br />The title refers to the letters these soldiers received, or tried to send.  In this sense, they are the same as the soldiers coming to attack them.  Eastwood, to his credit, does not try to push your buttons in regard to the Japanese men on the island.  Internal conflicts abound among the soldiers, who have differing opinions of honor, duty, and dying for one's country.  You can't help but feel some sympathy for these fellows, who spend their last days with no food, water, or ammo.</p></body></html>

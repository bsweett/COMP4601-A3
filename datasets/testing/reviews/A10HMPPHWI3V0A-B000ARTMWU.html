<meta name="summary" content="Direct Rip-off of Dea Koontz's "INTENSITY""></head><body><p>I would like to start off by saying that this film made by French Director Alexandre Aja was a complete and blunt copy of Dean Koontz's "INTENSITY" in fact the film was nearly 100% the same ... until the end (BEWARE... SPOILER AHEAD!) those of you that have seen the Film know that throughout the whole movie it was Cecile De Paris doing the killing all along which you could not see because you were following her mind and it was obvious that she did not know that she was doing the killing therefore you did not know that she was the killer, I know its complicated but bare with me ... anyways in Koontz's Novel "INTENSITY" everything was the same except that in the Novel there really was a killer that was slicing and diceing,the woman finaly over coms him by burning him into an oblivion (the few of you like  myself that have seen the movie as well as read the book will most likely agree that the novel has a much more effective ending... not to mention it is about 1000 times less confusing...) but anyways I cannot lie when I say that I was still scared when I watched this. The title does not fail the plot or story line and those of you who like to be scared or are looking for a good ole' fasion bloodfest are likely to be mighty pleased with this one......<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

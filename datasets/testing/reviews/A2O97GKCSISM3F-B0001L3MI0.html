The acting is good, the charecters believable, and the special f/x are excellent! Alot of critics despised this film, my question is, why?<br />Because the charecters were too stereotypical, nonsense! The three main charecters-Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Will Smith do the best job, and Margaret Colin, Vivica A. Fox, and Judd Hirsh are pretty good too, this film was 10 times better than Mars Attacks!-that was good the first time, then it got stupid. Director Roland Emmerich may have used alot of cliches with this film, but is there an unwritten rule that all cliches are bad? I'm getting pretty fed up with critics expecting absolute plausibility in movies, movies are supposed to be entertainment, not a confirmation of reality, unless they say, `based on a true story.' To make a long story short, too late!) Critics get over it!</p></body></html>

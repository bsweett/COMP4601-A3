It lacks a happy ending, but it is one of the most beautiful, sweeping, romantic, thought-provoking, historically accurate, and realistic epics ever made.  If you can believe Lawrence was Peter O'Toole's first film, and that he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar and DIDN'T GET IT - then you will have an idea of the sad feeling you have at the end. David Lean directed this film, five years after he directed the Bridge on the River Kwai.  Lawrence's cinematography and music are sublime.  There are many, many very good actors in minor roles.<br /><br />The film tells the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a British officer who was stationed in the Middle East during WWI.  Lawrence donned sheik's robes and led fractious nomadic tribes in a successful revolt against the Turks.  The unusual army destroyed Turkish rail lines and drove them out of their stronghold in Akaba, paving the way for the British army to come in.<br /><br />Lawrence was enchanted by the harsh simplicity of the desert, and had a genuine love and respect for the desert tribes.  He wanted the desert to belong to the Arabs, but constant warring among tribes and imperialist intervention crushed his dream.  He returned to England disillusioned and bitter.  For more information, Lawrence's book "Seven Pillars of Wisdom," published in 1922.  Seven Pillars details his experiences in the desert with the nomadic warriors, and the revolt.  David Lean, the film's director, based the film almost entirely on this book.<br /><br />In the film, O'Toole plays the strange and unique Lawrence perfectly.  O'Toole's intense blue, searching eyes, his handsomeness and his golden hair lend to create and immortalize the mythic figure of this warrior-poet.  One thing you know right away is that they broke the mold when they made Lawrence.  O'Toole seems lost in the British military compound, and comes alive in the punishing environment of the desert.  His brave and courageous acts leads a sheik to become his friends.  Omar Sharif plays Ali. His tribe follows Lawrence through "the sun's anvil" on a risky mission to add a band of brigands to their army.  The leader of the tribe of brigands, Auda, is played by Anthony Quinn.<br /><br />The scenes up until Lawrence's capture and abuse by Turks are glorious and inspiring.  El Aurents, as the nomads call him, is the Braveheart of the Desert.  But as in Braveheart, as in war, things cannot always end as they begin.  Herein lies the heartache of war.  A scene where Lawrence loses his mind and takes it out on bedraggled injured Turks is incredibly painful to watch, considering all that has come before.<br /><br />Sharif is so passionate, and an incredible actor.  He is Lawrence's sole support and it is painful to watch his grief as his friend slips into depression and madness.  Like O'Toole, he too had an Oscar snatched out of his hand.</p></body></html>

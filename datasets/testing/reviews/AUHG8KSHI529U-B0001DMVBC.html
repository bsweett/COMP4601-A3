<meta name="summary" content="Brilliantly done tragedy"></head><body><p>This is a painful story that has a great deal to recommend it if you can stand its sadness.  Here everyone is at fault, but no one is to blame.  It is the confluence of a series of awful situations that have simple solutions that are inaccessible.<br /><br />The story is told as parallel revelations of the lives of Kathy (tragically performed by the wonderful Jennifer Connely), and the Behrani family (Massoud Behrani is played magnificently by Ben Kingsley).  Kathy?s life is shattered into a torpor that seems almost fatal.  She is unjustly losing her father?s house because of a bureaucratic blunder she hasn?t the energy to resist.  Massoud Behrani is an immigrant working hard to recover something like the station he had in Iran.  However, he has to work multiple menial jobs just to be broke.  Kathy?s seized property is just the opportunity he needs to get back on his feet.<br /><br />Into this sad and volatile situation comes Lester (well portrayed by Ron Eldard) who is the sheriff sent to evict Kathy and is also in a precarious situation in his life.  What develops between him and Kathy is destructive to both of them and leads to a disaster for everyone in the film.<br /><br />The story doesn't tell you how to feel about the characters.  This adds power and depth to the film because you will find yourself arguing different positions on each of the characters (except maybe Lester).  This is not the result of indifference or ambiguity as much as it is an understanding of the characters and a strong wish that things could and should be different.  Instead, we get this terrible tragedy.<br /><br />Brilliantly done.</p></body></html>

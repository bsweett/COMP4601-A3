<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood Movie Making at Its Commercial Worst"></head><body><p>Silence of the Lambs was an exceptionally good movie...scary, funny, original, characters to care about, even touching. What a letdown with Hannibal. What a mess. The movie was all over the place, with calculated yuck moments for the fanciers of evisceration, hogs and chafing dishes. There was no chemistry between Clarice and Hannibal, no tension or anticipation, no wit, no characters worth anyone's interest (all just my opinion, of course). I remember reading Hopkins' answer when asked why he took the role. "Why not," he said, "After all, it's just a movie." That's the kind of condescension this movie earns.<br /><br />It seems such a classic example of Hollywood's calculated commercialism, where the grossness keeps the target audience happy and the grosses keep the producers happy.<br /><br />But the waste. Ridley Scott is the guy who did Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise. Julianne Moore is a top-of-the-line actress (Vanya on 42nd Street, The Big Lebowski). And Ray Liotta, so good in Goodfellas. David Mamet must have breathed a sigh of relief when they pitched his script and reassigned it to another writer. It would be easy to believe that Gary Oldman didn't want an acting credit.<br /><br />So much talent. So little good product. The money must have been persuasive.</p></body></html>

Of course everyone sides with the minister against Harry and his closest friends. Dudley (Harry Melling) practically gets sucked to death and the Dursley's (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) get a new flat screen T.V.<br /><br />The story plods along and leaves out key information revealed in the book. Every character stares at their feet and counts from one to ten before making their calculated statements. The film carries the story forward but does little to contribute other than a prophecy which takes all of five minutes.<br /><br />I do have to say that there was one good exception Helena Bonham Carter made a believable Bellatrix Lestrange the crazed dispatcher of Neville's parents.<br /><br />In place of story and acting we have lots of CGI filler. The graphics are par with today's technology with the exception of the department of mysteries; that location looked so phony that you would think you were watching Saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026YWQ4Q">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></p></body></html>

The acting, effects, and music are good. The story on the other hand lacked something to give it that edginess the first two movies had. Cloning our hero or making the big bad Umbrella guy a monster didn't seem surprising. A couple good scenes including one that you will say looked like it came right out of "The Birds" will make you perk up and say, now that was cool. In fact had they pursued more wildlife gone bad it probably would have made a better overall movie. I didn't mind that it borrowed from "Road Warrior", "The Birds", and "Coma", it just needed a better overall theme. That and it upset me they killed off two characters from the last movie that I thought should have survived this nightmare. Good quality DVD and fair replayability.</p></body></html>

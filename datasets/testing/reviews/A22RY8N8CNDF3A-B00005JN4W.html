It is a movie that all ages will find incredibly entertaining! It has a terrific story filled with comedy and thrills to keep everyone happy and engaged. The animated characters are unique, smart and fun to watch.  Pixar does an over-the-top job (as usual) with animation and design backgrounds.<br /><br />The movie starts with the marriage of the Parr's.  Because of rescue gone wrong and lawsuits, the government orders the Parr's to establish new identities and live a normal life as an average family in the suburbs. The Incredibles are the Parr Family- Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet and baby Jack-Jack.  Each have their own unique incredible super powers.  Bob Parr, who was "Mr. Incredible" misses his former super hero life and works at night with a former super hero friend, Lucias Best - known as "Frozone".  They sneak off at night to fight petty crimes.<br /><br />A mysterious woman, "Mirage" contacts Bob to offer him a job as Mr. Incredible to stop a rogue robot "Onmidroid 9000" on a distant island for a large amount of money.  Bob has lost his boring insurance job and not told Helen, his wife, so agrees to the deal.  He has to get back in shape and get a new super hero costume.  The costume designer, Edna, is a hoot.  One of the well-developed wacky characters that you immediately smile at.  Bob goes to the Island and is able to stop the first Onmidroid 9000.  He is paid a handsome sum of money and returns home to buy new cars, and presents for his family.  He is soon asked to return to the island for another job.<br /><br />Helen becomes suspicious of Bob's activities.  She sees a suit repair and knows that he has visited Edna, a top notch designer.  When talking to Edna she finds that Edna not only created Bob's new suit, she has created a new suit for each member of the Parr family.  Each has a homing device.  Helen uses this to find Bob's location and, as a licensed pilot, gets a jet to find Bob.  Dash (the speedy son) and Violet (able to be invisible) stow away on the plane.  They crash near the island and Helen uses her stretch super power and Dash's speed to land on the island.<br /><br />Syndrome is the evil one - he has always wanted to get even with Bob from his hero days. He is on the island with his assistant, Mirage.  He wants to get even with Bob from past slights.  Bob is captured by Syndrome with Mirage's help and is angry to find out through their security devices that his famiy is on the island and at risk.  From here there are many close escapes and adventures as a family.  Mirage turns on her boss, Syndrome, and helps the Parrs to escape and catch up with the Omnidroid heading for Metroville.  It is damaging the city with its ability to learn and fight opponents.  Assisted by Frozone the Parrs get the remote control and destroy the Omnidorid.<br /><br />When they return home, Syndrome has discovered the Parr's identity.  He is attempting kidnap the baby, Jack-Jack, and raise him to become his sidekick.  As Syndrom leaves to get on his jet, Jack-Jack realizes he can shape himself in a number of bizarre forms that cause Syndrome to drop him.  Bob throws Helen into the air to catch Jack-Jack - then throws his car at Syndromes jet, whcih causes Syndromes cape to get caught in one of his jet engines, dragging him to death.<br /><br />The Parrs' resume their normal life.  Then the city is threatened by a new villain called "The Underminer"...  Does this mean a sequel?<br /><br />Anyway, an excellent movie in all categories.</p></body></html>

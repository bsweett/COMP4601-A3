The Vampires and Werewolves "at each others throats" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones and teaming up to feed on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly.<br /><br />Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? Because without the war there would be no action-packed series thrillers called Underworld and Underworld Evolution. There's suspense, tons of action and a great storyline from the start of the original right through Evolution...which is a bit of a prequel/sequel.<br /><br />All of the key characters are back in Evolution played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel. The main addition is the Vampire Marcus that we saw coming to life briefly at the end of the original.<br /><br />The effects in the original and in Evolution are great. Marcus' flying in Evolution looks a bit more magical than he is actually using his wings, but otherwise the movie is visually spectacular.<br /><br />The series documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter marrying a Wolfman several centuries back. Flash back to the present and Kate Beckinsale is a Death Dealer/Vampire that hunts the last of the Lycan. Scott Speedman was a mortal in the original that supposedly held the key to end the war, but he unfortunately took some licks (and a couple bites...key words: a couple) protecting that key. Now in Evolution let's just say that he's more like X-Men's Wolverine than mild mannered Michael Corvin. A rift between the Lycans and Death Dealing Vampires is borne in Evolution involving Viktor's brothers, Marcus and Willliam. Hence the saga continues with a sequel that thoroughly entertains.<br /><br />Both the original and Evolution come in a brilliant HD transfer with terrific 5.1 sound.<br /><br />All in all a very well done story that pays to watch from the beginning. Yes, Evolution stands alone. But this is one movie that I believe was not intended for seeing prior to the original. So if you haven't already, you'll want to purchase both Underworld and Underworld Evolution and watch them in order.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase getting both movies into your collection. They are keepers for those into the genre. This release is for Blu-Ray DVD players. If you don't have a Blu-Ray DVD player and you've stumbled in here by accident try seaching Amazon again for the standard player release; Blu-Ray won't play on standard DVD players.</p></body></html>

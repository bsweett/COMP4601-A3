<meta name="summary" content="Solid entertainment, but ..."></head><body><p>I enjoyed &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; as a piece of epic entertainment, but it misses true greatness by at least a mile. The movie might best be described as a hybrid of &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; and &quot;Braveheart,&quot; with maybe a little &quot;Gladiator&quot; thrown in. I kept feeling like I'd seen this movie before.<p>Actually, the movie works best when it's in &quot;Dances&quot; mode, chronicling the adventures of a depressed white Civil War hero (Cruise in the Costner role) who adopts the lifestyle and teachings of a threatened civilization and ends up defending said civilization against encroaching white society. This is the most compelling aspect of the movie, even though its structure is borrowed whole from a film that most people now claim to despise because of its &quot;political correctness.&quot;<p>Cruise is very good as Nathan Algren, the alien in 19th century Japan, caught in the middle of a civil war of another kind, between ancient Samurai warriors and a government seeking to &quot;modernize&quot; itself with weapons imported from the U.S. He's bested by Ken Watanabe as a Samurai tribal chief interested in learning the ways of his enemy. Algren eventually becomes an honorary Samurai himself and fights against his own people, in a climactic battle lifted entirely from &quot;Braveheart.&quot;<p>Most of the action scenes are exciting, and there's plenty of Bushido lore and swordplay to keep Samurai enthusiasts happy. The photography is gorgeous, too. But it's still Hollywood's idea of an alien culture, a story told through the eyes of a white man who, by definition, can never fully experience the culture which the movie itself so desperately wants us to understand.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Contrived beyond belief, overacted; a meandering mess"></head><body><p>So many great criticisms have been written about this film on Amazon already: from the ridiculous plot that relies on about 20 coincidences and characters witholding crucial information in completely unrealistic ways -- to Sean Penn's inconsistent and overacted performance -- to the silly Lady Macbeth speech at the end which didn't have a freakin' thing to do with anything that came before. A lack of directoral skill seems very evident, as people are just acting up storms all around the place with nowhere to go. If the film attempted to be a trenchant look at loyalties and dynamics in a working-class urban environment, it failed. If it was really trying to be a sophisticated, postmodern whodunnit -- it failed.  Even the costume design (Sean Penn's Donnie Brasco jacket at the end looked ridiculous and way too Hollywood) was off the mark by leagues.  This film is very infuriating becuase it makes you sit through all this  "character development" and then it simply hemmorages on itself.  The redeeming elements? Well at least it was about human beings and not explosions / car chases. Bacon and Fishbourne were good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Costner's best since Dances"></head><body><p>I am not a Kevin Costner fan by any means, but his good movies are really good.  He gets it right when he gets out of the way of the characters and doesn't try to show us how wonderful he is.  Dances With Wolves was great, Bull Durham was outstanding, Field of Dreams was near perfect, and I even loved American Flyers, about him as a bicycle racer.  His bad movies stink to high heaven--Waterworld, Wyatt Earp, The Postman, For Love of the Game, because they are all about him, not the story or the characters.<p>Now we have Open Range, a great story about a group of &quot;Free grazers&quot;, men who live off the land with their cattle, but don't pay for any of it, they have no ties to a town.  It is the time when the big ranchers are taking over, and free grazing is looked down upon harshly, even though it is technically still legal behavior.  While grazing in a particular area, they realize they are missing some supplies, and they send one man back to the town.  When he doesn't return, the two main men in the group, Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charly (Costner) go to the town to see what happened.<p>Their friend was provoked into a fight, defended himself, and was now in jail.  The problem?  The sherriff and a rancher hate him for being a free grazer and set him up.  This sets up the story, where the men stay in the area to fight the sherriff and the rancher and stand up for their rights.  There is even time for Charly to fall in love with the doctor's sister (Annette Bening) before the final showdown.  The final gunfight is really good, mainly because it is so realistic.  This is how you would imagine a gunfight taking place.  Nothing glamorous, just reality.<p>This movie succeeds because the story is a good one, and the characters are people we care about.  Boss and Charly are good men, simple, but they play by the rules and they expect others to do the same.  They are loyal to each other, even though they have not had the time to learn much basic information about each other, like what Boss's first name is.  (wait until you hear what it is).  This is a slow paced, enjoyable western, not action packed, but interesting and something new, which is not something you can say about many movies coming out these days.</p></body></html>

Now I love Silence of the Lambs but this was just God-awful WAY too violent and just flat out gross.  This movie releyed on Anthoney's canabalism to scare the [heck] out of you.  Slience of the Lambs was much more suspenseful from a psychological stanpoint.  If you have any respect at all for the first movie aviod this just terrible sequel.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A terrible nightmare!"></head><body><p>This remake is a very, very stylized vision that lacks of that pagan approach and delirious cynicism of its predecessor directed by Robin Hardy in 1973.<br /><br />A cop witnesses a shocking experience when a fatal slip of a truck driver by trying to avoid a fatal crash with an animal in the middle of the road, turns and crashes directly with a car with the result of two fatal victims.<br /><br />And his protagonist - as well as James Stewart in Vertigo - being unable to forget himself, decides to investigate the strange missing of Rowan, a little child, in Summerisle, an island where certain facts seem to happen at the edge of the Western civilization where pagan rites and human sacrifices  are made in the name of their Gods.<br /><br />It's a worthy to watch film but the original is by far, much more enigmatic, somber and pessimistic.</p></body></html>

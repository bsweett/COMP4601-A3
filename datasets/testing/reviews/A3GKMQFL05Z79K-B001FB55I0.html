<meta name="summary" content="Terminator Salvation...."></head><body><p>I'll agree with other reviewers that this will probably be a movie most will either love or hate. Personally, I loved the movie and thought it was a great followup to the other Terminator movies. Be warned, however, that if you go into this movie expecting it to be like the past films- well, you be the judge. Whereas the other films dealt with alot of storyline about the Terminators, Cyberdine and Skynet; this film does very little to push that envelope along. In its' place, all we see are alot of action sequences with different types of machines and some Terminator action but not alot. Other than that, the cast was well chosen with all giving solid performances.<br /><br />The story takes place in 2018. Judgment Day has come and gone. John Conner is hard at work trying to convince the rest of the world that he is the key to their salvation from the Terminators. Marcus Wright is a death row prisoner who submits his body to experiments as penance for crimes he has committed(yet only hinted at in the movie). Awaking in 2018, Marcus discovers that the world has been destroyed and is no longer as he remembers it. Along his way, he meets up with Kyle Reese and that's where the movie pretty much starts.<br /><br />While I think Termintor Salvation is a great movie, it was pretty much done in McG's over the top style of filmmaking that he did in Charlie's Angels/Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle.</p></body></html>

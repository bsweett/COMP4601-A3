<meta name="summary" content="Quality film!!!"></head><body><p>Despite of all the negative press Russell Crowe seem to get off screen, there is no denying that he is one of Hollywood's superb actors. Once more in the movie Cinderella Man, Crowe proves that not only can he act superbly but also bring out the essence of his character to light in an unbelievable way. It also helped that he was well supported by Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellewager although I wasn't totally impressed with Zellewager's performance all the way.<br /><br />Based on the true story of James Braddock who won the heavyweight boxing title against all odds and prediction, this movie proves that even with all the cliches, if it done right, it will worked out fantastically. (Cliches worked well in Mel Gibson's When We Were Soldiers... and it worked well in this movie.) The movie is well scripted, well directed and superbly acted. A quality Hollywood film...a rarity nowadays.<br /><br />I read one of the previous reviewers giving this movie a low rating because it looked like a clone of Rocky. I believed that is an unfair statement considering that Rocky itself, was a clone from earlier boxing films.<br /><br />If there is a flaw, I think it lies in the portrayal of Max Baer. I have read that family of Max Baer is quite furious with Ron Howard for portraying Baer like some cheap, underhanded dirty boxer who appears to enjoyed killing boxers in the ring. In some way, they have some justified complaint since the entire Max Baer as a film villian, appears to be overhyped and heavy handed. A very clumsy move by an another wise skilled director in a quality film.<br /><br />Despite of that, the movie still work well and you can't help but get involved into the film even if the informative individuals like myself already knows the outcome of the story. I guess that is a hallmarked of a quality film.</p></body></html>

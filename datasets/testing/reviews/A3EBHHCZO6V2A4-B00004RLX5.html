<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek Saves the Whales"></head><body><p>"The Voyage Home" shows old school Star Trek at its best. There's plenty of suspense, humor, and the crew having a "fish out of water" experience...on 20th century Earth. It has the bonus of an environmental message-without being heavy-handed or hating humanity.<br /><br />"Voyage Home" begins with a probe circling the Earth-reminiscent of ST:The Motion Picture. Thankfully,it's not V'ger. It is transmitting a strange message to the oceans. It turns out to be--whales! The Enterprise has to go back in time to get humpback whales. The crew goes back to 20th century San Francisco. Kirk confronts punk rockers,and explains Spock with "he did a lot of LDS." They go the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where they meet a perky oceanographer (played by future 7th Heaven pastor's wife,Catherine Hicks) The romance between Kirk and the oceanographer is natural and humorous. It flows naturally from the story instead of feeling forced. Of course,there's a happy ending, the planet is saved, and the oceanographer goes back to the future with the Enterprise crew.<br /><br />"Voyage Home" is a fun,uplifting film. It's a Star Trek voyage worth taking!</p></body></html>

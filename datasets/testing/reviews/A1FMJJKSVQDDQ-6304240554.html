<meta name="summary" content="Blood and Guts"></head><body><p>George A. Romero's original "Dawn of the Dead" is as haunting and creepy as the remake. Despite its low budget, there are tons of blood and gore and violence all around. There's some black humor, also. The actors are believable as their characters are memorable. The zombies (not as fast as the ones in the remake) are just downright scary; the blood and guts are not for squeamish. Truly a must-see for all zombie lovers from all across the globe.<br /><br />Movie: A-<br />DVD: C+<br />I should've seen the Ultimate Edition rather than the Divimax. But oh, well.</p></body></html>

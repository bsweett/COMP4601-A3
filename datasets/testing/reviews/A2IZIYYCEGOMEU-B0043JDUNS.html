<meta name="summary" content="NOT AS GOOD AS ITS PREDECESSOR, BUT STILL FUN"></head><body><p>The plot in IRON MAN II was somewhat lame by comparison to IRON MAN I, and Mickey Rourke's mangled 'Russian' accent was almost laughable. The Introduction of War Machine was sweet, and the fight sequences were quite fun, especially those involving Iron Man and Rourke's  Whiplash character, even though I thought ( like several others, apparently ) that it should have been longer, and that the rather tiring mid-section of the film could have been abbreviated. Johansson's kickass Black Widow was excellent, but Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) was more annoying than anything else. Also, perhaps the director could have just placed a banner announcing the upcoming AVENGERS movie in the background instead of hitting everyone over the head with not so subtle references to it every time they had some dead space to fill. Still, Robert Downey Jr. is awfully fun ( and 'funny' ) to watch- so I give it 3 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DVD review"></head><body><p>A fairly weak Criterion Collection DVD. The storyboard to film comparison, compares a storyboard to the actual scenes shot in the first scene with ED-209. Who cares how it compared? They looked the same to me. Two  storyboards of scenes never shot are included. The first is a long action  sequence that was to come before the final shoot-out at the factory that I  found interesting. The second a sequence of Robocop going to Murphy's grave  that was cut in favor of the scene where Robocop goes to the database  center. This unshot storyboard is very short, boring and could have been  excluded. The illustrated essay is a lot of reading. This is something that  should have been a documentary or even an interview. If I wanted to read  about the movie, I'd buy a book about it. Finally the commentary is a sound  mix of the director, writer, producer and others. It gives interesting  views on making, writing and producing the film. The commentary is the only  redeeming value of this DVD. The director, for example, gives his view on  the symbolism to Christ he was trying to impart. Who knew this wasn't a  simple action flick? Overall, for the money, I'd stick with the standard  DVD unless this was a movie that is on your all-time favorite list.</p></body></html>

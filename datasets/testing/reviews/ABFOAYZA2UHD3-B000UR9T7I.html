<meta name="summary" content="OMG they "killed" Spidey"></head><body><p>excellent effects, animation sequences, battle sequences (directing on those as well), but the rest so disappointing!<br /><br />i so loved the spidey while he was just a comic book character and animation possibilities we now witness were not even a dream! and what did they do with it? they all but KILLED spidey.<br /><br />they made him cry with toby's huge blue eyes, they made him act ridiculous under alien's influence, oh, they managed to make him quite pathetic a couple of times.<br /><br />aunt may, on the other hand, is just as boring and anal as i remember her in the comic books.<br /><br />james franco is always a joy to look at. thank god for him..<br /><br />and that's about it.<br /><br />my GOD, this movie is so bad.. its at least 30 minutes longer than it should be, at times it slows down to alost a HALT. romantic interludes way way too long and boring to kaboozas.<br /><br />i couldn't wait to get the heck out of the movie theatre.<br /><br />and i saw a few people leave half way thru the film on the OPENING NIGHT.<br /><br />if you can piss of the fans, that stands for something, doesn't it.. :(</p></body></html>

I thought this Johnny Cash dude was some rebel, troublemake, and a man in black that has bad intentions.  To look within this movie is to look within a man that I would of never guess him to be.  How through all the trouble he went through he survived.  "You're saying I don't believe in God?"  Didn't even know he did Gospel tunes! Johnny story is a great story of survival.  I even bought Gospel Road by Johnny Cash.  I must say that this is a man that I wasn't expecting.  He has great character and inspiring intentions.  Joaquin Phoenix did a great job! Reese, also a great job!  This movie is awesome all around!!!  Hope you all enjoy this movie as much as I did!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Confusing Mix of Scenes -"></head><body><p>21 Grams is a dark, daring story of three sad lives.  The actors give fine performances, but the movie is hard to watch - way too much drama and with the emotions running rough and  relentless. This movie did far too many flashbacks and then before you can take one scene in, another segment of time flashes quickly before you grasp the meaning.<br /><br />The three main characters played by Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts are constantly striving to overcome addictions and life hardships.  Over a period of several months, an accident throws their fates together.  The overwrought drama of faith, redemption, love and mortality is draining to watch.  The sadness of drug addiction, infertility, organ transplants, low socioeconomic lives, and con men is definitely drama overkill.<br /><br />21 Grams takes dogged determination to watch.  Just putting the thrashing scenes and pieces of their lives together makes one dizzy.  There is nothing other than boredom throughout as the dark, graphic, morbid, mess of three lives was irritating to the senses.</p></body></html>

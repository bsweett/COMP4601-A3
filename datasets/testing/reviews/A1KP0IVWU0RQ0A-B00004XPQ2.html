<meta name="summary" content=""your as crazy as nicholson,both of you worried about how to die with honor when all that matters is how you live""></head><body><p>with those words william holden sums up this movie,and what a movie.david lean was the master of taking a grand scale movie and still making it a very personel psychological battle of wills.<br /><br />  this is really two stories in one,one being the battle between alec guinness as a british colonel and his his counter part sessue hayakawa who runs the japanese prison camp during world warII. their battle of wills is one of the most intense psycholgical battles ever put on screen,with both men unbinding and how the single-minded colonel takes his job of building a bridge over the title river as an excerise to prove that the british are better than their captiors,never seeing that he is in fact aiding his enemy.<br /><br />  william holden is a p.o.w. who escapes only to be forced by jack hawkins to return to the camp to blow up that bridge. we follow both stories till they both converge at the end. sounds simple but nothing about this movie is simple. after repeat viewings you can find layer upon layer to the story and the soldiers.<br /><br />  sir alec guinness won a richly deserved oscar for his amazing job as a soldier so blind to the code of honor that he can see nothing else. but william holden is the heart of the movie as the out for himself man who sees through guinness's and hawkins heroics and the all consuming quest for honor in a war when there isn't any. jack hawkins is a true joy to watch as leader of the men sent to blow up nicholson's bridge. and for once the enemy in the form of camp commander sessue hayakawa is showen as a well rounded person who finds no honor in his prisoners,but comes to understand and even like him.<br /><br />  when the two stories join up this powerful movie sets up a classic final 25 mins. thathas never been equaled in movie history. the final shot of mr.guinness as he finaly sees and understands what he has done is both heartbreaking and will stay with you long after the movie ends.<br /><br />  this two disc set is amazing,the film is lovingly restored and the credits have been restored to give carl forman and michael wilson as writers(the were blacklisted at the time so the french novelest pierre boulle,who wrote the book but spoke no english was credited as sole writer and picked up the oscar for screenplay for this). the extras are fantastic and that just makes the whole set that much better!!<br /><br />  this is in the top 3 war movies of all time,winning SEVEN oscars for guinness,picture,director,editing,screenplay,and score. and this features the famous whistling tune "colonel bogey march" that you will also remember long after the movie ends. if you love movies this is one you must have!! get this one now!!!!!!</p></body></html>

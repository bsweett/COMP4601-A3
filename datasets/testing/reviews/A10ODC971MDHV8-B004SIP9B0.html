<meta name="summary" content="The Queen"></head><body><p>Stephen Frears's wry, compelling docu-drama follows Blair's strenuous efforts to help the hapless Windsors avert a major PR disaster in the wake of Diana's fatal car accident. Oscar winner Mirren, whose uncanny channeling of Elizabeth's stiff-upper-lip airs is one of recent cinema's grandest performances, flawlessly captures the Queen's eerie old-world reticence. But she also makes her a sympathetic, even intriguing figure. By turns tense and touching, and consistently engrossing, by all means bow down to "The Queen".</p></body></html>

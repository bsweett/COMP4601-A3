<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Mystery"></head><body><p>A story which grabs and pulls you in from the first frame.  With a surprising climax in the tradition of Sleuth and Deathtrap.  Anything with Paul Giamati is got to be good, and the score by Philip Glass is excellent.  Recommended, two thumbs held high up!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's a showtime, folks - or why I love "Chicago" (2002) by Rob Marshall?"></head><body><p>I love "Chicago". How do I know that? I've seen it twice in the theater, the friend of mine downloaded it for me from the Internet, and gave me CDs for my b-day, and I bought a DVD when it finally became available.<br /><br />Well, it may not be nearly as perfect as the Broadway revival - the plot, the cinematography, and the chronologically incorrect details - but it is a good sparkling entertainment, and I believe that wherever he is, Bob Fosse would be pleased with this screen adaptation of one of his beloved musicals.<br /><br />First of all, Chicago did not take itself too seriously - there are a lot of details that were reused from Bob Fosse's himself (the All That Jazz number was done like an opening scene in Cabaret, Velma's playing with the chair in I Can't Co It Alone - also). Roxie's Funny Honey with her laying seductively on the great piano in the pink dress is a reverence to the Michelle Pfeiffer's "Makin' Whoopee" number in the Fabulous Baker Boys. Whatever Roxie was doing while she performed that song was not just a singing; it was a very good acting. And there was Billy Flint (Richard Gere), the silver tongue, the prince of the court rooms - and his scenes, the clever and funny satire on the TV and big screen court room dramas and comedies (Billy: "Objection!" - ADA Harrison:"But Your Honor, I have not even asked any question"!).<br /><br />Second, "Chicago" surprised me. I was not the biggest fan of the actors who played the main parts when I went to see it for the first time but I know good acting when I see it. With her first appearance in the opening interpretation of "All That Jazz" , Katherine Zeta-Jones just blew me away - the woman can sing and dance, and she had a lot of fun doing it. She was born to play Velma. When the actors have fun enjoying what they are doing - I as a viewer appreciate it and enjoy watching them - which is important, right? The following scenes were as delightful as the opening - Queen Latiffa as Mama Morton, the fantastic Cell Block Tango - people, look me in the eye and tell me that Cell Block Tango was not fun to watch and listen to? My personal favorite was: "He was crazy, and he kept on screaming, "You've been screwing the milkman." And then he ran into my knife... he ran into my knife ten times."<br /><br />The film even touched me when John C. Reilly was doing his Mr. Cellophane's number - it actually showed in those three-four minutes the sadness and loneliness of a small man, maybe not very bright but decent and devoted one. The fact that he loved a conniving little bitch just made it more interesting.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who do not like Renee Zellweger. I am not her fan, either, but I have to say that she did almost impossible in "Chicago" - she made people look at her when she and Zeta-Jones were on the screen together. She acted great, her character was changing constantly - from the sweet little housewife dreaming of fame to the frustrated and humiliated woman who killed her lover to the common heartless criminal who'll stop at nothing to receive money, power and fame. It was crafted very well and absolutely believable.<br /><br />With all that said, I am not sure that Chicago was a Best picture of 2002 but I know that I enjoy watching it and I will see it again.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Amazing Conclusion to this tale of revenge"></head><body><p>Several months ago, eclectic director Quentin Tarantino regaled our senses with a visceral thrill-ride known as "Kill Bill: Volume 1".  This first half of Tarantino's epic tale of revenge introduced to the enigmatic former assassin known as the Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) and the circumstances that led her to embark on a quest to `kill Bill'.  Mamba miraculously survived an assassination by Bill and his current hit squad (although her entire wedding party was murdered), only to end up in a coma for four years.  Once she regained consciousness, she began to exact brutal vengeance on those responsible.<br /><br />In "Vol. 1" she took out Vernita Green/"Copperhead" (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii/"Cottenmouth" (Lucy Liu).  The revenge was purely physical and graphically brutal.  It was a veritable assault of visual images and thrilled the audience with the completeness and thoroughness of Mamba's revenge.  Fascinatingly, "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is a drastically different film even though it continues the same story.  "Vol. 2" takes a more philosophical approach to Mamba's revenge, whereas "Vol. 1" was the more physical approach.  While more talkative possessing less action, "Vol. 2" is no less effective than "Vol. 1".  What "Vol. 2" brings is the rest of the story that "Vol. 1" rightfully left out.  In this concluding episode, we now know more about the history between Bill and Mamba.  We learn more about why Bill ordered Mamba's assassination.  As an added bonus, after seeing a steely-eyed killing machine in "Vol. 1", we get to see a more vulnerable Mamba in this installment.  The combination of the two volumes completes this story.  One is the yin to the other's yang.  The choice to split the film into two parts now not only seems correct, but essential.<br /><br />Doubts about Tarantino still having `it' should be full dispelled by this incredible cinematic achievement.  "Kill Bill" honors martial-arts films of the past while setting a standard for future films to emulate.  "Kill Bill" manages to thrill the senses while challenging the mind.  Tarantino showed that he had this talent when he made "Pulp Fiction".  "Kill Bill" is the next step in the evolution of Tarantino's work.  Where he goes from here is anyone's guess, but it has the potential to be spectacular.</p></body></html>

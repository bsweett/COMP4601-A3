<meta name="summary" content="A halfway decent sequel. OH NO! LOOK AT THE TITLE.. BOOHOO!"></head><body><p>I think it was definitely a little cornier than the first one. Then again, what do you want, it's a Ben Stiller movie? I didn't have high hopes to start with when I watched this. The  first one may have been a tad bit funnier, but this one had some scenes in it that outdid the first one. All of the skits with the baby made this movie. It also surprised me because it made laugh a lot more than I thought it would. I was expecting dry, boring jay leno kind of humor. So I wasn't disappointed there. I also did not want to see this movie because Barbra Streisand was in it and I thought she would ruin it, however,  I must say she did a very good job at her roll. An above average, decent, funny movie.<br />NOTE:<br />To the old conservative prudes: I feel someone must say something. I am so tired of all you cry babies offended by the name of this movie. Just because it is close to the F word? Have we come to this? Is this what the world has come to? Grow up! Or maybe, the opposite, act immature once in awhile! Maybe if you did you wouldn't be such an old prude that everyone dislikes. How about that? You conservative pukes make me sick and you shouldn't even be renting movies. You only rent movies so you can complain. Be'atch Be'atch Be'atch Be'atch that's all you do. OH GOD, look I used a word close to the B word. WAHH!!! You big baby! DO us all a favor and stop renting movies, stop watching tv, and isolate yourself from any form of media. Also, do us a favor and jump off a cliff head first onto a thumbtack. You censoring pigs. Stop breeding please. Thank you!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="RECKLESS, FUNNY AND CYNICAL"></head><body><p>The fact that this film saw the light of day in our society where smoking more and more becomes somewhat a taboo is already a miracle and a merit of its creators. This movie should have been done especially after Michael Mann's The Insider, just to show us the "other side", to hear arguments of the people who have a right to be heard as everyone else in any free country. And in its cynicism and recklessness Thank You For Smoking came out to be extremely ruffian-like and hilarious as for example People VS Larry Flynt or Private Parts. You can't resist admiring this picture as girls usually can't resist bad guys' charm. What's even more preposterous and outrageous, but inevitable I guess, is that you feel empathy for Aaron Eckhart's character, a character who earns money by persuading people into smoking, who profits from others' misery if you will. You like his character. I just loved him! He is smart enough to prove his point even if he's wrong, more than that - he's smart enough to persuade people to do something they absolutely don't need to do. He's the ultimate puppeteer, a Dr. Evil. You'll ask how it is possible to admire such person? But see, he doesn't put cigarettes into anyone's mouth, people do it themselves, and only they are to blame. We usually tend to blame everyone else in our misfortune, but it's us and only us who is responsible. I smoke myself, but if I get ill of it I'll never start blaming a tobacco industry - I have my own head on my shoulders to make decisions. In another words if people are fools it's nobody's fault except their own. And if you can manupulate people with a spoken word you're a genious, and I personally admire such persons. And this film is not about proving the point that smoking is good, Aaron Eckhart's character says himself he doesn't think smoking is good, he just thinks everybody is entitled to his own opinion and has a right to share it with others. It's parents' and schools' business to educate and teach to distinguish right from wrong.<br /><br />There was only one thing that seemed strange at first glance in this film. Just imagine - it's a movie about smoking, but there's no single person smoking on screen throughout the entire picture! Was that an attempt to make the flick politically correct or director Jason Reitman's deliberate concept? I think it's rather the second, and if it's really like this it's extremely funny. I also had a feeling about the film trying to seem politically correct, when Aaron Eckhart's character quit his job as a tobacco lobbyist in the end. But moments later we see him explaining to some executives in a mobile phones company there is no evidence phones cause brain tumor. Long live the cynicism!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Little Holiday Cheer"></head><body><p>This movie is a sweet and sometimes touching holiday treat for the whole family with a touch of hilarity and a little sadness it could be added to any holiday collection.<br /><br />Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls into Santa's (Ed Asner) bag as a baby and is eventually adopted by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). Buddy grows up making toys for Santa but never quite gets up to the speed of the other elves and after trying a few odd jobs at the Pole he overhears the fact that he is really a human being and not an elf. This sets Buddy off on a search for his real human father in New York City. Buddy does his best to snuggle up to his father Walter (James Caan) and his step-mother Emily (Mary Steenburgen) while having a hard time dealing with all of the harsh chaos of human life.<br /><br />This film is a sweet portrayal of a human being brought up among elves in the faultlessness of Santa's home. It takes an innocent, positive person and places them right in the middle of all the negative human behaviors that seem to be magnified during the happiest of holidays. It places a smile back on the faces of anyone who lost the magic of Christmas and the joy of Santa Claus. And it definitely makes you look at your own attitude towards the people you "love" and care about while sadly showing all of the lost virtue of humanity. With Will Ferrell cast as the childlike elf it never ceases to be funny but some of the gags are a little far stretched...especially the burping scene! James Caan is great as the shut down, stressed-out and angry father. And who could forget Ed Asner as Santa! Overall a great message stems from this Christmas movie and you might even find yourself hoping for one last meeting with Santa Claus before your heart freezes over for good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EASTERN PROMISES DELIVERS!"></head><body><p>Iloved and even own the DVD movie - A History of Violence - another Cronenberg/Viggo Mortensen combination of an utterly terrific cinematic extravaganza. There should have been Oscar nominations there for numerous reasons.<br /><br />And the same goes for this new film by the same team-up - Eastern Promises.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen turns out another - and most probably the most prominent - performances he's done thus far. What an actor! But all the other actors here are truly terrific in their parts as well. Naomi Watts of King Kong plays alongside Viggo with an Oscar worthy performance as a woman filled with bitterness and pain.<br /><br />The movie has already been told and digested here in this forum, so we won't bother with the movie's storyline. But this wasn't unfortunately not an action-packed movie, but DID have one of the most brutal and most realistic fighting scenes ever developed for film with Viggo going against two mobsters in the Russian bathhouse. Didn't have that staged and chereographed look to it at all.<br /><br />The ending was too sudden, and unfortunately we felt a bit let down to it. It really needed more of a solid ending here, seeing the destruction and/or decline of the Russian mafia family that Viggo worked for.<br /><br />But when it comes to plot and storyline, as well as top-of-the-line acting, Eastern Promises delivers in spades. Although, in our humble opinion, overall History of Violence was better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Entertaining Action Flick"></head><body><p>This second installment in the Bourne series picks up where the first one leaves off and does so in a very entertaining fashion.<br /><br />It begins a couple of years after the first movie and finds Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) living with his lover Maria (Frank Potente) in India.  He is framed for the murder of a CIA agent and someone makes an attempt on his life.  These events set the action in motion and it never slows down after that.<br /><br />The story goes from India across Europe and also has action in Russia.  Bourne is a very efficient operator and makes life very dangerous for those who are gunning for him.  As the plot unfolds, he keeps regaining parts of his memory.<br /><br />Anyone who liked the Bourne Identity should love this one.  It is a better thriller and will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.  I enjoyed it a lot.</p></body></html>

Instead I am going to give you all you need to know.  Go watch this film!  It is BY FAR the BEST Marvel presentation to date.  Granted, the original story was "updated" for the current audience, but the major points of the story remain the same. While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days.  That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming).  However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST.  WHY?  Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero.  What  novel concept!  Way to go Marvel and everyone else involved.  You got this one right!  This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

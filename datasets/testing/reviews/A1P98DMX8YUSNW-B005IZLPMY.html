Instead, because it has to have some plausibility as being set during WW2, the effects here are not as headache-inducing. Yes, it has the usual evil-genius plot we would expect, but it also delivers some male bonding storyline, and a somewhat cliched strong-female love interest to relieve the hardware fantasy show. If you haven't seen how this fits into the grand scheme, you will still enjoy because the movie stands alone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best of 2007"></head><body><p>I found A History of Violence to be a good movie, but Eastern Promises is crafted into something even better. The acting by Viggo Mortensen is outstanding, even Oscar worthy, while Naomi Watts and Armin Mueller-Stahl lend good work as well. The movie is just the right length at about 1 hour and 45 minutes. It doesn't feel rushed or too long. The movie is gory and brutal, but not nearly as violent as I expected going in. If you liked A Histroy of Violence or mob films in general, this film should land on your best of 2007 list.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Mixed Bag: The Good, Bad, So-So"></head><body><p>Making these kinds of movies is fraught with dangers. There are so many things that can go wrong, and some things did in this expensive-- costs were nearly two hundred millions dollars-- epic "inspired" by Homer's ILIAD.<br /><br />First the good: there are certainly many things to like about this movie. Although the film is about three hours long, the action moves rapidly. The ship scenes as well are the hand-to-hand combat battles are quite amazing and really do become epic-like. Some of the acting is terrific as well. Eric Bana as Hector gives a first-rate performance. Julie Christie in a small role as Achilles' mother is also great. But Peter O'Toole as King Priam-- British accent notwithstanding-- is simply wonderful. (Of course he is no stranger to period pieces with movies such as BECKET, LION IN WINTER and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA under his belt.) The scene where he approaches Achilles to beg for the dead body of his beloved son Hector achieves high tragedy, something that rarely happens in epics. Just as in grand opera with its usual outrageous plots, when real acting occurs, it's all the more appreciated.<br /><br />Then those things that really aren't that significant (so-so). First, the director plays hard and fast with the original story; but after all, it's just his inspiration, not his roadmap. Remember: the movie is not the book. There are also missed opportunities. For instance, there is a beautifully scene in the ILIAD when Hector goes off to battle and sees his wife and child for what will be the last time. Because he is wearing his helmet, his baby son does not recognize him and cries. This is one of the most touching scenes in all of the ILIAD. I thought the director was setting us up for that in this movie. The child cries as Hector says goodbye, however, and then puts on his helmet later.<br /><br />Finally the bad: Orlando Bloom as Paris is totally unconvincing as someone Helen would even look at. And Brad Pitt, for all his buffed-up beauty, is still Brad Pitt, only with long hair and in ancient Grecian drag. He is completely miscast as the sober, brooding, sulking Achilles.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing, however, for all the battles and the fine acting by Peter O'Toole.</p></body></html>

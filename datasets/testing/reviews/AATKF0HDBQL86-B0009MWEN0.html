<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating on several levels"></head><body><p>I have seen Starship Troopers as well as reading the book by Robert Heinlein, and unlike those who might tell you not to waste your money if you've already read the book, I would actually recommend that course of action.  Why, you might ask?  One reason I recommend this movie is because of what it did for me--it led me to buy the book.  I had heard Heinlein's name mentioned in connection with other s/f series before, but until seeing Starship Troopers on VHS I had never felt any urge to actually sit down and read his works.<p>Another reason I recommend this movie is because I find it fascinating on several levels: 1) As a special effects-laden extravaganza; 2) As a satirical adaptation of a sci-fi master's work; and 3) As just an enjoyable, mindless fluff-fest.  Somehow Paul Verhoeven managed to work all three elements into one movie, a nearly impossible task in the world of moviemaking, and he carries it off brilliantly.  For those who have read the book and found themselves not liking the movie, I would definitely recommend watching it as a mindless fluff-fest.  You'll enjoy it much better that way.</p></body></html>

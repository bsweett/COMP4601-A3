Still, some things are cool enough that you've gotta take the time to recommend them no matter what.  As I said in my title, this film is pure entertainment, from beginning to end.  It virtually never lets up, and has the visual innovation, technical brilliance and sheer oddness to make feel like it could've gone on for a whole lot longer without getting old.<br /><br />As others have said, this is perhaps the ultimate 'guy film', and it's delightfully violent and perverse without either becoming to grim or seeming like it is solely meant to shock.  Plenty of people are offended by the violence, though it's tough to imagine why considering how over the top most of it is.  Also, others have accused it of being sexist as the majority of the women are in the film are prostitutes and scantily clad. (You'd think the fact that all the men in the movie are killers and criminals and slimebags would offset this and make it merely misanthropic, or perhas *gasp* a sheer piece of absurd fantasy with no real connection to reality, but apparently not)  I find both these causes for offense to be utterly ridiculous, but it is relevant to the certain groups.  So prudes and humorless feminists: Beware! You won't wanna see this movie.  Or, maybe you will, as getting offended seems to be the primary pleasure of those two groups.  But whatever, the people who do wanna see this movie know who they are, and they'll like it.<br /><br />As everyone knows, this movie is divided into 3 major sections.  I like this pattern, as only having a couple relatively brief segments means that things have to get going fast, and that the film has numerous peaks.  Everyone loves to compare this to `Pulp Fiction' though this isn't totally relevant, as though the segments cross over and reference each other, they all stand alone and don't really illuminate each other all that much.  The internal references are just kinda... cool, but they aren't really all that important.  Though there is a slight concern: The segments proceed in decreasing order of quality, so the best parts of the movie are at the beginning.  Still, it's all good enough that this doesn't matter all that much.<br /><br />Most people love to talk about the black and white with occasionally bits of color as the major trait of the film, but I think some of the other stylistic quirks are more unusual and intriguing.  The dialogue and acting are deliberately over the top, a slight caricature of you're stereotypical noir dialogue and mannerisms, which combines with some nearly perpetual voice overs from the primary characters, and lots of sleazy music to complete the noir feel.  The overblown noir stylization is combined with some really bizarre and of the wall characters, such as the scrawny-mute-superhuman-cannibal-serial-killer-farmboy, the misshapen-yellow-pedophile-mancreature and the deadly-asian-ninja-prostitute.  This is all pretty weird, naturally, but it never gets so unusal that it can't be taken seriously.<br /><br />The film also really illustrates the potential of digital filming, as the backgrounds and scenery are combined with the actors seamlessly.  The world doesn't look real, exactly, but, of course, it's not really meant to, and there's never any doubt that the actors are there.<br /><br />Despite the emphasis on style, and over the top violence and action, the film has a certain emotional resonance.  It may all be absurd, but Marv and Hartigan are still genuinely likable, sympathetic characters.  Dwight is less compelling, but he's still pretty, well, cool, and that's pretty good too.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  The core-audience for this film will almost certainly like it, and have doubtless already seen it.  Everyone else... I dunno.  But I sure like it.</p></body></html>

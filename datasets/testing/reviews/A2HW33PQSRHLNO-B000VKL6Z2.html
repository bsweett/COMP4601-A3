<meta name="summary" content="Pretty bad, but an interesting take on Michael Myers"></head><body><p>The only thing I can say for this movie is that at least it isn't another SEQUEL to the "Halloween" series: the last one with Busta Rhymes was so atrociously bad that I wondered to myself if John Carpenter regretted making the original in the first place.  Also, Zombie has some creepy<br />scenes with respect to the budding superhuman psychopath who goes by the name of Michael Myers: Loomis' black and white tapes (Malcolm McDowell is completely wasted in this role) where a young Myers wears demented masks, descending further and further into psychosis and rage.  That's about the only chill you're gonna find in this movie.<br /><br />The rest is just typical Rob Zombie fare.  Young women bruised and bloody, screaming in pain, sociopathic trailer trash descending further and further into hopelessness, and scene after scene of depraved brutality for brutality's sake.<br /><br />You almost get the feeling that Zombie is parodying the original: Malcolm McDowell actually hosts a college lecture on guess what, folks? "The Devil's Eyes"!  Would that have anything to do with the lines Donald Pleasance rasped (effectively) about Myers' in the first film?  And hey, Brad Dourif is the sherrif!  Otis is the graveyard keeper for Haddonfield!<br />Udo Keir is in the movie for about five seconds!  Wow!<br /><br />Oh, and we get treated to about fifteen minutes of a young Michael killing some mice.  Thanks, Rob.<br /><br />That disturbing, unnameable, mysterious atmosphere in the original is replaced by mere slasher fare.  I have to admit that I really don't get what people are out to get with respect to Zombie as a filmmaker.  All he does is imitate classic grindhouse flicks of the 70's to very little effect.  The only redeeming quality I can find in any of his work is perhaps the increase in hygiene around the country: I've felt compelled to take a shower after watching a couple of his movies.<br /><br />Buy the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Chilling Trip through Jack the Ripper'sWorld"></head><body><p>From Hell explores a theory about the identity of the infamous 19th-century serial killer Jack the Ripper.  Facts about the over a hundred year-old actual crime have unfortunately been lost. Many different theories exist as to who Jack the Ripper was.  From Hell explores a newer theory that came about in the 1970's, when old documents were discovered.  It is the "Royal Conspiracy Theory."  The idea is that Prince Albert had an illegitimate child with a London street prostitute, whom he secretly married.  When the royal house found out, measures were taken to silence her and her whore friends, who were witnesses at the church wedding.  This theory also involves the Stonemasons.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is the best actor in the film.  He plays the opium-addicted - but brilliant - Scotland Yard inspector Adeline.  His co-star Heather Graham falls flat as the whore-target ofthe Ripper.  For starters, her red hair looks so artificial and anachronistic.<br /><br />The filmography, sets, and music are chilling.  Jack the Ripper's carriage, with his goblin-fire green lantern and black horses looks like a coach from Hades.<br /><br />The ending, and the actual revelation of J.T.R. I found more funny than scary.  There were too many close-ups of his face.  He was more scary as a faceless figure in a top hat and cloak.<br /><br />I have heard some say the film is gory.  It is not at all.  I am squeamish, yet I hardly flinched.  C.S.I. episodes are ten times as gory.</p></body></html>

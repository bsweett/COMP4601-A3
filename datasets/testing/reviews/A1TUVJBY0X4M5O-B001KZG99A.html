<meta name="summary" content="RoboCop 2 Rip-Off"></head><body><p>I've heard how great this movie is for months.  So I finally get to see it...and it seemed like 2 hours before he finally got the damn suit on.  Pretty slow build-up there.  Also the "villain" was...nobody.<br /><br />Good news is Robert Downey Jr. was FANTASTIC as a playboy, pompous businessman, monkeying around with the suit, sitting eating a burger during the "change of heart" press conference etc.  The tension between him as Bond and Paltrow's MoneyPenny (or whatever the hell her name is) was believable too.<br /><br />But once it gets building up to the climax...I really stopped caring.  Particularly when the final battle ends of being a blatant, BLATANT rip-off of the final battle in RoboCop 2.  If you didn't see that one, what happens is little RoboCop ends up fighting a much larger Robot with a gatling gun on his right arm...and later ends up on his back, piggy-back style, destroying it.<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />Christ people...would it kill you to write something original?<br /><br />So I recommend RoboCop 2 (and the orignal of course).  That one's not afraid to splatter blood all over too, instead of G-rating the action for the kiddies.</p></body></html>

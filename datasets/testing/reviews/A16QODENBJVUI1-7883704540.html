<meta name="summary" content="An absolute delight of a film"></head><body><p>There have been so many reviews written here that there is not a whole lot that I can add to what has already been said.  I'll merely state that this is my favorite animated film of the year.  I'll also confess that when I first heard about it and saw the previews, I was not impressed.  To me a movie about a rat who was also a cooking genius seemed both farfetched and ludicrous.  I was convinced that they had more or less run out of ideas.  I was wrong.  The film is bristling with great ideas and wonderful touches of humor.  The software that allows them to produce this level of CGI is nothing short of astonishing.  It only makes you wonder what software thirty years from now is going to make possible.<br /><br />One interesting decision is the way that in their CGI and character design they've decided to go incredibly realistic in all inanimate objects, but somewhat "cartoonish" in all animated characters.  The software has clearly come to the point where it would be possible to make humans look extremely realistic.  Instead, they decided to make them look like extreme caricatures.  I personally applaud this decision.  It makes for far more expressive characters.  Also, if they were trying for extreme realism it would call too much attention to that fact.<br /><br />After this film and THE INCREDIBLES, I might be willing to say that Brad Bird is my favorite animated director currently working in the United States.  I can't be too confident in saying that simple because his total body of work is too small.  But I was delighted with THE IRON GIANT when it first came out and he has done nothing since then to disappointment me.  From here on out I'll go out of my way to see one of his movies.</p></body></html>

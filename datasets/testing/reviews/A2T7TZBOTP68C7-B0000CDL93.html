<meta name="summary" content="Scary"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone's Director's Cut DVD has an extra seventeen minutes of footage added.  This adds to the general suspense of the movie.  JFK starts off very slow, like a History Channel documentary, and you think &quot;Bo-ring!&quot;  But suddenly, in the whirlwind of dizzying camera shots and angles, you realize you are witnessing dark and distorted history being unearthed.  By then you are so deep in, it is impossible to get out.<p>Kevin Costner is brilliant as New Orleans D.A. William Garrison, the man who brought the only public trial to this date on the JFK assassination.  A string of brilliant and well-known actors complement the film.  Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, and Tommy Lee Jones give the movie so much credibility because their performances are simply so believable, and way out of the usual roles they play.  In fact, this whole film represents a role the U.S. player that is far, far out of the role we usually play.<p>The score by John Williams alternately scares the beejesus out of you, or galvanizes you to action.</p></body></html>

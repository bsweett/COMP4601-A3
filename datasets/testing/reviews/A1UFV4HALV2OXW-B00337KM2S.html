George Clooney plays a guy whose job it is to go into companies and fire people. That's the basic premise, but this film is much more than that. It also focuses on his lifestyle: living out of a suitcase, with a practically unfurnished apartment that he "visits" only a few days a year, and no significant relationships to speak of. Both his professional and personal lives take drastic turns, and that is really what makes this movie appealing. This is a movie that evokes a wide spectrum of emotions, and that is truly what a good movie should do.</p></body></html>

Sure, there are plenty of great zombie movies out there, but this classic is one not to be missed. In case you're unfamiliar with it, it's kind of like a non-sequential continuation of "Night of the Living Dead". Set in Philadelphia, this tells of four SWAT-team members that hide out in a mall from the living dead, while taking advantage of the mall and getting kicks outta it, too.<br />That alone should let you know that this movie is awesome. Imagine what it would be like to shoot down the flesh-eating undead in a massive mall! This movie has everything from the zombie horror of blood-splattering and flesh-eating to thrilling action to slapstick comedy. The movie goes from scary to funny to sociopolitical all in its two-hour run.<br />"Dawn of the Dead" is, in case I didn't state it enough, an extraordinary movie. What other zombie flick offers shooting zombies down in an open field at the break of dawn, a blue-skinned Hare Krsna zombie and makeup artist legend Tom Savini in a leather-clad biker gang riding their motorcycles in the dead of night?<br />Yep, this movie goes from the slaying of the undead to genuinely ironically funny moments, such as slapping a whipped cream pie in a zombie's face, or the scene where two of the guys take the money from a register and smile for the security camera (that one's a good laugh!).<br />And just to prove that this zombie movie doesn't disappoint, there's plenty of the red stuff getting splattered from zombies and victims alike, alongside their consumption of flesh! And yeah, I'm sure you're aware of the social commentaries on the buyer's consumption at the mall. George A. Romero's good at the double-entendres in the plot like that, he's quite an intelligent film-maker.<br />"Dawn of the Dead" is definitely a special movie, and isn't necessarily one of those movies that you'd pop in every week or so. It's an experiece, and a stunning one at that, both visually and at times intellectually. So kudos to Mr. Romero, who knew what he was doing and never sold out, you made a great movie! All fans of zombie films MUST watch this classic! You won't be disappointed! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

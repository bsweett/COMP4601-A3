I saw enough to learn the subtitles are unreadably Chinglish, and that I won't understand the dialogue unless it's loud. The video is low quality, as if some guy pirated it with a camera in a theater. So I'm going to pick another time to watch it. I'm not in the mood tonight.<br /><br />It starts outside prison, which never happened in the original, and with Adam Sandler being difficult to watch as usual. If you've seen this, and if you love the NFL the way I do, tell me the truth. Is this crap?<br /><br />Oh, and let me share the cover blurb with you. "Protect is a red very a fit of occupation rugby contestant ever, but was closed into because of a certain reason jail. The jail grows the cool love rugby, however born nature Endure. He hires the exclusively those excel the jail that play the rugby, letting them proceeding with prisoners' game." Yeah, I think Roger Ebert wrote that.<br /><br />** UPDATED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AFTER SEEING THE CORRECT DVD **<br /><br />The first eight minutes reminded me why I hate Adam Sandler. Actually, I didn't need that long. That's just how long it took to end the drunken party of a sort that only happens (I hope) in Hollywood movies with overworked stereotypes, and the car chase with cops who are overworked stereotypes. And Adam Sandler, himself an overworked stereotype portraying a character who is yet another overworked stereotype. Convinced that this was the only scene he and his peeps felt compelled to splice onto the original movie, all of which happens IN PRISON, I ejected the DVD and got back to it three days later.<br /><br />Segment three begins with Sandler's arrival in prison. However, it isn't a real prison. It only exists in Hollywood movies. It's where they lock up the cliches. I waded through ten more boring minutes of prison guard violence, brutal crotch hits and so-called wisecracks. The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared.<br /><br />"The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared." I never thought I'd type those words.<br /><br />At last, the movie. What came before was backstory in the original film. I dunno why they felt they had to show it now when they were only going to tell it later, since it was too boring to show. Oh well.<br /><br />When this film got down to the football itself, that's when it got real. This one isn't for the girlie girls, okay? Since there were many NFL players in this film, football is what they know. Kinda surprising the prison wasn't more realistic, though, since many NFL players know that subject as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the hell out of its juvenile humor in a testosterone-charged way. I appreciate what it has to say about football, prisons, violence, and whatever else it's on about. How brutal was the original? So brutal that this one was less so in spots. They tinkered with a few bits, but in a good way. A homage not a copy, they say. I agree. It's excellent. I'll keep it and watch it again, skipping the first 20 minutes or so, and I'll love the hell out of it. It's a damn shame to think everything else Sandler makes will probably suck like the parts of this movie I'll keep skipping.</p></body></html>

Taken is marvelous at this because its premise is not only something that makes for a great action thriller, but is also a huge problem in the world today, often overlooked by many: human trafficking.<br /><br />Liam Neeson gives a balls-to-the wall performance as ex CIA operative Mills. Neeson may not look like an angry stud like Willis, Schwarzenegger or Stallone; but trust me, after seeing him here, he's more than convincing. I enjoyed seeing him play a ruthless villain in Batman Begins, and he takes that same dark edge and brings it to our hero in Taken.<br /><br />Mills has lived a vey fast paced life and seen action in numerous global conflicts to include Afghanistan. All that is behind him now though, as he has made plans to mend his tattered relationship with his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Between the hurt feelings of several missed birthdays and Christmases due to the excessive travel of his job, and Kim's mother's new insanely rich live-in boyfriend; Mills has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />At 91 minutes, Taken is a very short film, especially for its genre. But it never seems short and it gives us everything we need early on, to care for its characters and the events that happen to them. The relationship between Mills and his daughter is crucial to the story and had it not been believable, the film would have suffered. It is believable. He cares for her more than anything in the world and wants nothing but for her to be happy.<br /><br />So naturally, when his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and Kim need his permission for Kim to leave the country, to follow U2 to France with a friend, Mills wants to oblige them. It's painstakingly hard for him at first, as he is more than aware of the dangers that face a young girl traveling without adult supervision in Europe; but we already know from the film's title that he will let her go.<br /><br />Mills is super-smart however and exceptionally well prepared. He buys her a universal cell phone, and only agrees to let her go if she will in turn agree to calling and checking in with him at his approved times.<br /><br />On the first day in France, Kim witnesses from across the hall, her friend being kidnapped. The film's pivotal moment is a phone call between Kim and her father as she explains to him what is happening.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer, I thought Mills was in on it, by his freakishly calm comment to his daughter, "They're going to take you." But the only reason he is so calm is because he realizes he only has a few precious seconds to tell Kim what to do, before these heinous men take her. He tells her to hide under the bed and to shout out every detail that she can about her captors, and that he will come for her. The suspense builds from there as one of them actually picks up the phone, and Mills delivers some of the best one-liners in any action film of recent years. The scumbag's response? "Good luck."<br /><br />Having obviously recorded this conversation with hi-tech spy equipment, Mills uses sources in Langley to assist in narrowing down the list of suspects. A nice little game of `I told you so', and an immediate plane ticket to France from his ex-wife and her rich boyfriend, and he's off.<br /><br />Taken could have easily been over the top and unrealistic but Neeson plays Mills so genuinely, that we never doubt he'd be capable of pulling any of these things off. Yeah, there are a few one guy takes on several guys action sequences, but they are executed well and initiated with Mills' brains, rather than bronze. His wits and extensive training allow him to infiltrate these European trafficking layers with great ease.<br /><br />I have no idea how they pulled off a PG - 13 rating, but they did! The action is intense and in your face and the suspense could shatter bones. Mills has no mercy in this film and we love him for it. Watch for the scene that takes place at a dinner table, while Mills visits an old friend. You will never see what he does coming; you'll know the one I mean.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the actors they cast to play the villains in the film as well; you really want to see them suffer for what they've done to these young women. In case you are unfamiliar with the term human trafficking, let me simplify it for you. They kidnap young women, drug them, and sell them to rich men to use as sex slaves. Many of them as is the case with Kim are minors and virgins, and they go for the most cash. Make no mistake, this may be a big Hollywood movie, but this goes on every day in our world.<br /><br />I've read some skeptical reviews on the film from writers who seriously doubt that this world exits to the extent that the film portrays. I'm more than convinced that it's not far off. I've seen some truly evil people in my life and I've seen how money can corrupt people too. Give evil men money and power and what do you think they'll do with it? No-one can deny that these women go missing, so where are they going then?</p></body></html>

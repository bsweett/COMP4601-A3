<meta name="summary" content="Mystic River Flows Toward The Oscars..."></head><body><p>I just saw this film today because I had missed it in its first run at the theaters, but I heard that it was just put back in theaters. I was going to give this movie only 4 stars, then I began to realize that I had been thinking about this film ever since I got home over 8 hours ago. This is just one of those movies that won't leave your mind for days, it's that powerful. Okay, I'm gonna come right out and say this is Sean Penn's finest performance of his career. He deserved that Golden Globe he won last night, and he really should get the Oscar too. He displays so many emotions in this film it's hard to "Penn" down what his character is really feeling. Of all the performances in this great cast, Penn's felt like he wasn't even acting. It almost looked too real. I also really liked Kevin Bacon and Laurance Fishburne in the roles of the cop duo trying to break the case. The only main performance I really didn't care for too much was that of Tim Robbins, which also got him a Golden Globe last night. I know a lot of people said he was great and convincing in this role as a man with a tortured soul, but I found many of his strong emotional scenes unbelievable. Don't get me wrong he was good in this movie, but not his greatest role and film which I believe is still The Shawshank Redemption. The twist ending wasn't quite what I expected, but I still left the theater emotionally drained and yet satisfied. This is easily one of Clint Eastwood's best films and should be seen by all who have patience for a slow moving, yet interesting story. See it in theaters before you have to wait a few months or more for it to hit Dvd. I know I'm glad I did!</p></body></html>

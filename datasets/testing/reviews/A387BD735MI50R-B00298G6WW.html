<meta name="summary" content=""The In-Laws" Thrown Into a Cuisinart"></head><body><p>This movie is an uneasy, undecided hodgepodge of screen genres.<br /><br />It would sort of like to be an over-the-top male bonding comedy - like "The In-Laws." But it doesn't maintain a comedic tone consistently enough to achieve that. Too many really raw, realistic elements are interjected to allow a viewer to relate to the characters as benign buffoons. When Pierce Brosnan, in his role as hit-man, actually blows up a man and then blows off a woman's head - any likeness to Peter Falk's good-natured exaggerations as an "In-Law" - gets blasted away too. Although Pierce Brosnan remains stylishly good to look at throughout the movie, I emotionally turned away from him early in the action and just couldn't care any more.<br /><br />On the other hand, this movie certainly doesn't sustain any Sidney Lumet-like tone of gritty mean streets. The goofy unlikelihoods begin to pile up and interfere with any attempt in that direction. Brosnan is just too inept to be believable as a hit-man who could ever have been successful. A real hit-man would hardly hang around exchanging playground banter with a child, while staring obviously in the direction of his next victim. Nor would a real hit-man call attention to himself by traipsing through the lobby of a fancy hotel in only his very brief swimming briefs.<br /><br />Everyone's actions and motivations are jarringly unhinged here. Everyone is multiply hyphenated. Brosnan is a glamorous hit-man - perennially pathetic whorehouse john - loveable goofball - pedophile - cool cat - blubbering victim of mental breakdown. Kinear is an affable family man - ride-along assassin. Kinear's wife is a sweet wife - desperate housewife. And you can't excuse this mishmash by saying, "Well, everyone is a complex amalgam of many things." No, that just won't wash in this case.<br /><br />In one of the DVD's commentaries, the director/writer of this movie guffawingly admits that he jotted off the script for this film in a flash of improvisation. He threw together all sorts of elements of male fantasy, including the image of the matador - which really doesn't aptly serve as analogy to any of the actions or actors in the film. Although the movie is visually arresting - which is why I gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />But as for coherence or artistic vision - there's none here. It's as if someone took "The In-Laws" and "The Pawnbroker," threw them together in a Cuisinart, and hit "Shred."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One man's snivel shown"></head><body><p>This movie proves to be a definite improvement over the book, only because the excessive sniveling have been limited due to the interest of the movie. If this' an one man's view of his experience in the Marine Corps, its a pretty sad one at that.<br /><br />In Swofford's experiences, the US Marine Corps proves to be nothing more then but pronographic loving, lewd mannered sniveling jarheads who survived Operation Desert Storm only because their Iraqi enemies were even more weaker then they were. But this is one man's view and he wasn't a very happy Marine for sure. It pretty hard to called this a "war movie" since it really wasn't much of a war. The self-inflicted stress and trauma these Marines on screen suffered from were home sickness, boredom, losing their girlfriends and wives to guys at home and lack of enemies to kill. I am sure that the veterans of Vietnam, World War II and Korea wishes their stress and trauma were that terrible as well.<br /><br />The movie overall, however, appears to be well produced, directed and acted. Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good job playing the main sniveler, Swofford. Swofford proves to be an interesting character because despite of all the whining he does on screen, he still tries to do his duty the best he can. Jaime Foxx also shine as well as Swofford's squad leader and the movie appears to be well supported by fine acting.<br /><br />However, if you watch...let say...Saving Private Ryan prior to watching this movie, you will probably feel a great deal of contempt toward the whining Marines of this movie. And if not, you will still feel like questioning if this is the ideal model of "the few and the proud" Marine Corps material. I hope not!</p></body></html>

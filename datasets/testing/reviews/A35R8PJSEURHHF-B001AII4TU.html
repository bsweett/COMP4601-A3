It's easy to see where they "expect" you to laugh and seeing most of the funny parts in the previews many times, how can we laugh again?  The storyline could have been a bit deeper.  This one, again, had great visuals as the other Shreks.  It just seems to be lacking the "magic" of the first one.</p></body></html>

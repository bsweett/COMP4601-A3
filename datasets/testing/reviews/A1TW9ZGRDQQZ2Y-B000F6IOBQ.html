The special effects and acting have much improved (Kraven is given no dialogue!), but the story is a little hard to follow at times. I need to catch this one again just to get everything straight. If you liked the first film, I almost guarantee you will enjoy this one as well. Even if you don't enjoy anything about the movie, you can gawk at Kate Beckinsale for two hours. Yummy!</p></body></html>

It's simply a lot of fun--a great story, well told--and succeeds on almost every level that film attempts. The characters are multi-dimensional, intriguing and all sympathetic; the pacing is seat-of-the-pants; the direction is artful, but never at the expense of the story; the music another gem from John Williams (and uncharacteristic of his normal brassy fare); the acting is superb (and I hope that given this, The Aviator, and others that people will finally admit the sizable talent of the often unfairly hated DiCaprio); and the plot is a gem.<br /><br />One aspect that I love is how DiCaprio's character is an awful con-man, reprehensible by every measure, and yet is just so very daring and intelligent that he demands our respect and admiration (and, sometimes, jealousy). Also, in his relationships with his parents (featuring a great turn by the normally out-of-control Christopher Walken), the policeman chasing him, his would-be wife and others, we see the real human being, inside, his dreams, hopes and failures. In the end, we care.<br /><br />Finally, the movie gets style points for its retro-60's opening sequence and theme, and the subtle points that you may just miss on a first viewing (for instance, DiCaprio tracing handcuffs while talking on the phone to the police). Excellent, excellent movie that you'll watch more than once. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

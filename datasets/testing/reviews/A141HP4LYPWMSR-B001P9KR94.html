<meta name="summary" content=""She Could Be The Third Musketeer" ~ Reaching For The Stars"></head><body><p>'Slumdog Millionaire' is one of those films that we unfortunately seem to be seeing less and less of. It's exciting and uplifting with a storyline that has you ready to stand up and cheer at the end. It shows how one person can rise out of poverty and live the life he dreamed of. Nothing is guaranteed, but you only have a chance if you're willing to try.<br /><br />Another aspect of the film that I enjoyed was the fact that the story took place in India. I find the location and people fascinating and tend to gravitate towards anything and everything dealing with the Indian landscape, both physical, cultural and spiritual. Obviously this was a film I was destined to appreciate.<br /><br />I was impressed by the performances delivered by newcomers and stars; Dev Patel and the lovely Freida Pinto. However there were also a number of excellent though minor performances by actors who are all but unknown in American but actually quite famous and popular in India. The two I'm thinking about in this category are Anil Kapoor who played the part of Prem, the dishonest game show host and Irfan Khan the police inspector. I thought Anil Kapoor was amazing, in my opinion delivering the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Recommended viewing!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Almost as good as "Raiders""></head><body><p>1957 - jeeps are driving up to a military base.  There's a sign warning of a bomb test shortly.  A Colonel requests entrance on the base and is denied.  His men open fire on the sentries and storm the base.<br /><br />Their goal--the soon to be detonated bomb? Nope, the dusty storage facility.<br /><br />The men, who turn out to be Russians, open the trunk and drag out a hostage.  Guess who?  If you guessed Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) you are correct.<br /><br />That's the opening to this film...<br /><br />It's twenty years after we left Indy.  He's a little bit greyer, but he's still going strong.  This time, he's teamed up with Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a motorcycle riding, leather wearing college dropout who needs his help saving his father Oxley (John Hurt) and Mom, Mary (Karen Allen) from the Russians who are holding them captive.<br /><br />What the Russians want is a Nascan Indian relic, a crystal skull of legend that some say was the manifestation of a god. If they don't get it, Mutt's parents die.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this film:<br /><br />There may be some wear and tear on Ford, but he can still pull off playing Indy.<br /><br />Karen Allen is back reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood. She's always been the best of the female leads in this series and she still can deliver 26 years after "Raiders."<br /><br />Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) a Russian research into psychic phenomenon and the supernatural is the lead villain and she plays her part superbly. My favorite part of this film is the typical car chase with an Indy twist that every action and adventure fan should love.<br /><br />Plus, I think the themes in this story tie together a lot of elements that people who love the Indy series are going to appreciate.  I will definitely be buying the DVD when it becomes available.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, May 2008</p></body></html>

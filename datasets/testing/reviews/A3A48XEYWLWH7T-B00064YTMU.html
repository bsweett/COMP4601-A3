Manhunter was a nice step leading to his magnum opus, Heat.  Collateral, while lacking the epic scope of Heat provides a more personal one on one feel.  It's as if Mann has expanded the conversation held between DeNiro and Pacino in Heat at the diner and fleshed it out more fully in this film.  Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who has the unfortunate pleasure of picking of Tom Cruise, a paid assassin doing the rounds for the evening.  Cruise almost makes it work for me, dressed in gray with prematurely grayed facial hair.  He's as gray as his soul.  However, too many times I almost cracked under disbelief thinking back to his numerous other `good guy' roles.  Still, Foxx made good progress throughout the movie on his journey of empowerment until the finale where of course, he must take on Cruise to save his sweetie.  A bit of a stretch to be sure, still the interplay between them and the dark streets and night of LaLa Land as a setting made the movie gripping, and ultimately memorable I think. Not Heat, but what could be.  Still, recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent!"></head><body><p>This thoroughly enjoyable, pneumatic movie tells the story of Mozart's rise-and-fall on the music scene in 18th-century Austria. Told in flashback form from the point of view of musical rival Antonio Salieri, it covers with a broad hand the more salient points of Mozart's life, and dispenses with historical accuracy for a more expressive and emotionally communicative feel.<br /><br />The acting's of a very high standard, with F. Murray Abraham giving a committed, layered and impressive performance as the jealous Salieri - not overshadowed by Tom Hulce's flashy, deceptively superficial turn as Mozart - which is a big deal, considering Hulce's performance is one of those show-stopping, scene-stealing turns that you don't really see anymore. If Abraham won the Oscar for this, then Hulce, for his part, is fantastic at portraying the decadence and the fevered genius behind the screenplay's reading of Mozart's character, but also gives the man impressive depth and pathos, when necessary. These two principal actors are more than amply supported by the excellent Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's plagued wife Constanze, Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II and a very young Simon Callow as Mozart's friend-and-colleague Emanuel Schikaneder. Also, a pre-pre-pre "Sex and the City" Cynthia Nixon does an excellent job in her tiny role as the Mozart family maid.<br /><br />The behind-the-camera talents of director Milos Forman, art director Karel Cerny and cinematographer Miroslav Ondricek are the real stars of "Amadeus", though - the film's style is as operatic and fantastical as its treatment of Mozart's biography, and the tone and pacing of the sumptuous visuals lend a very palpable sense of doomed-genius-reaching-critical-mass to the film. There are no slow points, nothing is visually flat, and every detail and flourish imaginable has been crammed in - like the painted fantasies of Mozart's opera sets, "Amadeus", works beautifully as a baroque spectacle, and, 24 years after its original release, remains a testament to the creative genius of its crew. Mozart's operas are staged with a wisely underplayed sense of drama, furthering the viewer's connection with the more important driving forces behind their creation - the lives of those involved - and the visual feel of the movie is that of floating haphazardly through a chaotic swirl of decadence, art and high-octane drama.<br /><br />I'm no big fan of classical music, and remain unconverted - but as an exercise in storytelling, "Amadeus" is a treat for any and all fans of solid, gripping films. It hits home runs on all the fronts it chooses to show you, and, while not an exhaustive or particularly accurate account, is a deeply engaging and thoroughly enjoyable piece of cinema. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

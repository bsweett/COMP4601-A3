<meta name="summary" content="Dark "Phoenix" captures essence of fifth Harry Potter story"></head><body><p>Many arm-chair quarterbacks have slammed David Yates' turn at the helm of the "Harry Potter" franchise, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."  These killjoys need to take to heart Anton Ego's soliloquy on criticism at the end of Pixar's "Ratatouille" and remember how hard it is to create something, but how easy it is to criticize.<br /><br />This is by far the most difficult adaptation of Ms. Rowling's beloved series of novels.  "Phoenix" is the darkest and longest of the first five novels, easily containing enough material for two films if one took the same stance as Chris Columbus and threw everything from the books into the movies.  Yates didn't have that luxury, and so drastic cuts were needed.  For devoted fans, this movie likely feels like "highlights from Harry" instead of a true movie, but such is the fate of most film adaptations.<br /><br />The question is, how good an adaptation is it?  For the most part, the movie triumphs brilliantly.  Harry is traumatized by Voldemort's murder of Cedric Diggory at the close of "Goblet of Fire," but it seems that only (some) Griffindors and Albus Dumbledore are willing to admit that Voldemort is back.  The Ministry of Magic sticks its head in the sand and questions both Harry's and Dumbledore's credibility, leading to a dark analysis in the story of media manipulation and government paranoia.<br /><br />Not for nothing is there not a single mention of Quidditch in the entire movie.<br /><br />The acting is all top-notch, particularly from the three kids we've seen grow up before our eyes in this series.  The cast of experienced British actors is at their typical excellent best.  But the movie is practically stolen from our favorite heroes by a villain, and not Lord Voldemort.  Insead, Imelda Staunton swipes the movie with her evil schoolmarm, Dolores Umbridge.  This lady says more about evil with a polite 'hem-hem' and a glassy stare than any number of foam-mouthed rants by lesser actors - she is a riveting, horrible pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Special kudos also go out to newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, Harry's spacy classmate.  This moon-unit's a charmer.<br /><br />The DVD is also chock-full of the usual DVD extras we've grown to appreciate from the Harry Potter series.  While nothing rises to the level of Peter Jackson's four-DVD sets for the Lord of the Rings movies, these are excellent additions for the kiddies (lots of games and whatnot).<br /><br />A must-see for any fan of Harry Potter, although die-hard fans will likely grab their dog-eared copy of "Phoenix" to see what exactly Yates left out.</p></body></html>

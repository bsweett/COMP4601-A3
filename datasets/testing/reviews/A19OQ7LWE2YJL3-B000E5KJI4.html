<meta name="summary" content="Should be called "Achilles" ...or The Brad Pitt epic"></head><body><p>I was so sick of Brad Pitt's puffy face by the end of this movie.  He was in practically every scene and it really ruined the movie for me.  The story wasn't developed enough, Branna's part as Hector was fabulous and his portrayal was fabulous.  Orlando Bloom's character Paris was downright cowardly, foppish and almost dislikable.<br /><br />I really felt the part of Achilles was badly played, and it was very hard to believe Brad Pitt was this great warrior.  He's just not the type.  He was too small and not believable at all that he could be beating all those men.<br /><br />See another epic, see Gladiator or even Braveheart, over this.  I hope it does not kill Branna's career.</p></body></html>

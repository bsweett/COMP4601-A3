<meta name="summary" content="Saw 3 times as disturbing"></head><body><p>The Saw series keeps movin right along, and fairly well I might add.  Though there is some greatness about the first Saw that gets a little lost in each of the sequals, there is more that is added too.  In the case of Saw 3, I must say the scenerios are as disturbing as ever, and becoming more complex and original.  The movie begins with a bone-crunching (literally) squirming start that already leaves a nasty flavor, and quickly moves to a scene with a man standing in an old classroom, with chains inserted throughout various parts of his body.  The bloodshed gets going in Saw 3, though the real scenario takes about 30 minutes to set-up.<br /><br />The Saw theme still continues in the third installment - "are you grateful to be alive?" and a little more is added to the mix about obsessive vegence.  Such is the case with Jeff.  His son has been killed in an accident.  Jeff is forced through a series of tests, placing him in contact with the various people he wishes were dead since they did nothing to help his situation (eyewitness, judge, and the killer himself).  Jeff's test is to see what lengths he will go to forgive these individuals and save them before the traps they are in expire.  This is where traps in Saw begin to take on a whole new level.  It's not merely bloodshed anymore, and though not always gore-filled, the scenarios are quite frightful such as a naked woman in a freezer room, constantly sprayed with water.  Or a man chained to the bottom of a pit, while hogs are liquified and dumped on him...yes you heard right.  The scene is enough to make one vomit.<br /><br />While Jeff is being tested, Jigsaw is on his deathbed, and another test is occuring.  Lynn is a doctor who must keep Jigsaw alive or she dies as Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith, who makes a recurring role from all the Saw films thus far) watches in frustration.  Keeping tradition going, you can expect another surprise ending you may not have seen coming, but would say is more predictable than the previous two Saw films.  People are being tested in the film, but in the end you begin to realize the bigger picture and what the bigger tests actually are.<br /><br />Saw 3 does a great job of keeping things in perspective with the prior films, mostly the first Saw, which is fine by me since it is the original and I thought a stronger movie than Saw 2.  There are plenty of flashbacks of Amanda, how she became Jigsaw's apprentice, and we even get to see some prequal shots that went into the making of the bathroom scene in Saw.  Saw 3 even begins exactly where Saw 2 left, with detective Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg again reprising the role) locked up in that same bathroom.<br /><br />Saw 3 is a good continuation to the series.  The story remains fairly complex, interesting and somewhat unpredictable, though still looses the greatness of the first two movies.  If you are looking for blood, gore, and terrifying traps, Saw 3 goes all out this time.  I say, just be grateful with your life so you don't have to ever experience them.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Horror/Gore - 5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

She moves to the country with her pregnant mother, to live with her stepfather Captain Vidal.  The Captain is not a nice man, in fact he is evil, spending his time torturing captives and waiting for his son to be born.<br /><br />Ofelia has a secret world, a world of fairies and fauns.  When a faun appears to her inside the labyrinth, which is part of the grounds of the mill she has come to live in, he informs her that she is a lost princess, and must perform three tasks to prove she is not a mere mortal.  Ofelia readily accepts the tasks, and the Book Of The Crossroads that the faun gives her.  From the book she learns her tasks to be filled before the next full moon.<br /><br />'Pans Labyrinth' is a dark fairy tale, not one for the kiddies.  I finished the movie and immediately watched it again.  The faun FX was extremely well done.  The thing at the banquet table was sumptuously disgusting, creepy as all get-up.  I think I'm in love with it.<br /><br />The war story and the bad captain left me feeling shades of 'Shindler's List' inside the story, and I remembered the warm-up of David Bowie's 'Labyrinth', now all grown up into a big-boy movie.  It brought to mind the McFarlane Twisted Fairy Tales figures that sit on my shelf watching me as I write this.  It also smelled faintly of 'City Of Lost Children' but perhaps that's simply because it was twisted and subtitled.<br /><br />The acting is excellent, the photography stunning, and the dream breathes the fetid breath of imagination.  Del Toro leaves it up to the viewer whether or not Ofelia's world was real or in her head.  And what was that thing that came out of the toad's mouth?<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie would be that it needed more Labyrinth and less war.  This is a superb movie for the horror or dark fantasy lover, worthy of a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

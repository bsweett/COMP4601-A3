<meta name="summary" content="Gets old on repeat viewings"></head><body><p>The Prince music is pretty good and Jack Nicholson is having fun and Michael Keaton was a pleasant surprise, but mostly this movie is a  by-the-numbers action movie with a bunch of exposition leading to a fight  sequence. <p>Of course, this is still a Tim Burton movie and it is  beautiful for that and there are some great scenes that are worth repeat  viewings. However, it doesn't lend itself well to the plotline or lack  thereof. <p>Two major flaws in the movie are the lack of fight choreography  (yes, I know most fights aren't staged beautifully but this is a cartoon  and I want real fight sequences) which looks even more pathetic after a  decade of the Hong Kong Renaissance and the subscription to the Frank  Miller school of Batman writing. It works in the comics but on screen  Burton isn't quite up to task and he makes it into a silly cartoon that  wants to be dark (or a dark movie that wants to be a silly cartoon) and it  falls short of being gripping or interesting in that 80s comic book  fashion.<p>Overall, a good movie to see once and maybe twice, but probably  not a movie to buy. Still it's better than those awful sequels.</p></body></html>

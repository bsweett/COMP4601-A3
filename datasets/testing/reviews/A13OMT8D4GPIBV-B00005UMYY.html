<meta name="summary" content="A Very Original and Highly Entertaining Piece of Cinema"></head><body><p>Christopher Nolan has amazed me with every movie he releases.  From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F3CD">Following</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a> but Memento stands out as my favorite.  Why?  It's not only one of the most original movies in a long time.  It's one of the best movies of the 2000's.<br /><br />Memento is the story of a man trying to find out who killed his wife, although he has more obstacles to face than your average revenge character does.  He has a problem with his memory.  He can't make new memories and can't retain anything for too long of a time.<br /><br />This movie is extremely engaging.  You don't want to miss a single moment of this film.  It's quite good too.  The story, although it seems to be told backwards, is actually told in a different non-linear way.  It jumps from place to place, although it's still easy to follow.  This isn't your normal blockbuster entertainment flick.  It's deep.<br /><br />The Limited Edition DVD release is one of the best releases of all time.  It is loaded to the brim with special features.  Includind an excellent audio commentary from Christopher Nolan, plenty of features, a trailer, making of featurettes, and some amazing hidden features including a chance to watch the movie chronologically.  I haven't yet tried this but it's definitely worth it to better understand the entire movie.<br /><br />This is a definite Must Have.  A thoroughly engaging movie and a DVD that gives it due respect.</p></body></html>

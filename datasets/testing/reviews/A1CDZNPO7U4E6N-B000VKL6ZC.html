<meta name="summary" content="Rob Zombie is a GENIUS!"></head><body><p>First of all, I think Rob Zombie is just getting better and better at this. Afterall, I thought the best he had to offer was "House of a 1000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects" but this movie exceeded all expectations that I had. Secondly, I am pleasantly surprised to see that his wife Sherry Moon Zombie can actually act which I was highly doubtful of in the beginning. To be quite honest, I don't know if this movie can be considered a remake or a prequel, but maybe, it's Zombie's vision of Michael Myers, and this was his take on the story. Thus, giving the audience an understanding of why Michael Myers is the monster that he is. Personally, I think Rob Zombie's mission is to breathe life back into the horror genre that has been dead and buried for some time now thanks to the lack of originality by "the powers that be." I believe his mission has been accomplished with this version of Halloween. This movie is not some "teen slasher" fluke, nor is it for for the squeamish at all, and it's the closest thing you'll find to scary these days. It starts off showing Michael Myers as a 10 year old boy. Michael's mother is a stripper, his stepfather is abusive, and his older sister is a slut. Michael is also tormented at school by fellow classmates. In fact, the only things that Michael finds any solice in, is torturing and killing animals and his ability to create masks. The only person Michael even relates to is his baby sister. On Halloween, Michael snaps by beating one of his bullies to death in the woods behind the school. Later on that night, he kills his stepfather, sister, and her boyfriend after they refuse to take him trick or treating. After that, Michael is institutionalized for having no knowledge of even commiting these murders. I think we all know the rest of the story from here. At any rate, this movie goes inside the mind of one of the sickest, most brutal killers of all time. I hate to have to spoil some of the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, but the one reasons I don't think this is a prequel or a remake because Michael kills Dr. Loomis in this one, and we all know for this to be a prequel or a remake that can't be possible. Other than that small detail.. I LOVED IT!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Wicker Man"></head><body><p>Edward Malus (Cage), a California cop, is looking into the disappearance of an old girlfriend's daughter.  Willow (Beahan), the old girlfriend, lives on the mysterious and remote island of Summersisle.  Edward makes the journey, and finds that the women run the island, with the men being laborers.  The islanders worship a nature goddess, and the islanders look to Sister Summersisle (Burstyn) for leadership.  Soon, it seems that the islanders may have some idea of what happened to the girl, but none of them are talking.  As the May Day ritual gets closer, Edward must find her before it is too late.<br /><br />"The Wicker Man" is an interesting movie.  It keeps you guessing for the majority of its running time, and then delivers a whollop in the last ten minutes.  I have never seen the original, so I cannot make comparisons, but I do know the ending is the same, and that is perhaps this versions greatest triumph in today's movie world.  Cage is adequate as Edward, not giving much more than the script requires.  Burstyn in eerie as the matriarch of the island.  The story is good, and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers is downright creepy at times.  If you are looking for a good suspense film, then "The Wicker Man" is for you.</p></body></html>

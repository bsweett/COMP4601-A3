<meta name="summary" content="Bond meets Mr. Faulty"></head><body><p>This is an excellent Bond movie with great stunts, plenty of action and of course the women.<p>A lot was made of Hale Berry she was interesting and a good character but didn't take over the movie as suggested.<p>I'm really getting sick of M being played for a fool in these movies.  This never happened before Ms Dench took the Job.<p>The sword fight in the center was quite awsome and I didn't recognize Madona dressed she should try it more often.<p>Bond Locked up for over a year was interesting.<p>However this movie hit a brick wall for me when John Cleese came on the screen.  Cleese plays Q as Basil Faulty and the result is SO good and SO funny that it frankly eclipses the rest of the movie.  I find myself smiling just thinking about it.<p>There is an excellent comic moment at the end tangently involving Cleese as well.  Both of those scenes are worth the price of the movie.</p></body></html>

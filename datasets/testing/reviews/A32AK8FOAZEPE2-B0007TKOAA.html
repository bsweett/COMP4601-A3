<meta name="summary" content="a so-so movie with so-so storyline and"></head><body><p>so-so directing, screenplay, editing. the whole movie is actually quite boring and contrite. there's nothing too excited about it, just a so-so mediocre story. best supporting actor? nahhh. sitting and watching it, felt a bit suffocated and have to surpress yawns all the time. pretty luke-warm, very forgetful.</p></body></html>

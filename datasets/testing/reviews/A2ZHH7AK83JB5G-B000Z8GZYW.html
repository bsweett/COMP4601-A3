<meta name="summary" content="Punxsutawney Bill"></head><body><p>Hard to believe it has been fifteen years since this comedy classic was released.  Fortunately GROUNDHOG DAY is standing the test of time and is still one of the funniest films ever made. If you don't know the premise Bill Murray stars as an obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman who resents almost everything about his job and especially his annual trip to small town Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog Day festival there.  After behaving abominably to his producer(Andie MacDowell), cameraman (Chris Elliot) and all the small town folk there a blizzard comes in and closes all the roads out of Punxsutawney putting Bill in panic stricken sarcasm overdrive.  But the blizzard is the least of his problems.  Bill finds by some magical time loop he has to keep repeating February 2 until he gets it right.  Highly recommended though I will warn you I had the tune to Pennsylvania Polka in my head for several days after watching this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The greatest comedy of the sound era"></head><body><p>On a recent Saturday night, in a back bedroom at my parents' house, I was feeling so lonely and desolate.  I realized how Marilyn Monroe might have actually committed suicide, even in the middle of an otherwise very happy week.  I put a restored studio print of Billy Wilder's SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959) into my DVD player.  Within one minute after the opening credits, I was smiling.  At the 20 minute reel change, I was actually feeling happy over the audacious blend of B&W gangster drama and snappy Roaring 20's comedy.  By the time Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis were in drag on the train going to Florida, as part of an all girls band with Marilyn Monroe, I was laughing out loud and feeling wonderful.<br /><br />? Recently voted the #1 Best Comedy of all Time by the American Film Institute, HOT just might be the funniest movie you'll ever see.  Lemmon (Best Actor Oscar nominee) and Curtis are in incredible form as "Daphne" and "Josephine", hiding out in Sweet Sue's all girl band after being witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929 Chicago.  Marilyn, as Sugar Kane, has a comic field day (and deserved an Oscar nomination also) sharing a train upper berth with Daphne, a romantic tryst on a yacht with Curtis as an oil millionaire, and three wonderful songs.  Meanwhile, Daphne does a mean tango (and gets engaged!) with Joe E. Brown as a millionaire staying at the Florida hotel.  (Location filming was done at San Diego's evocative Victorian era  Hotel Del Coronado.)  And note the songs that Monroe sings and how each is darker than the previous one:  "Running Wild", "I Want to Be Loved By You", and "I'm Through With Love."  The lady is just incandescent, helped by Oscar-winning Orry-Kelly gowns.<br /><br />The screenplay here (another of the film's six total Oscar nominations), by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, is incomparable.  The plot is expertly constructed, and every line of dialogue is either hysterically funny or a reaction to something hysterically funny.  I have never seen Curtis this good (playing three different roles in the performance of his career), Marilyn this delectable, or Lemmon this pricelessly funny.  But Joe E. Brown also gives the performance of a lifetime as he tangos with Lemmon's Daphne and does not care that Daphne is really a man.  And George Raft and Pat O'Brien have field days sending up their 1930's Warner Bros. screen images.  It is little touches, like Raft ready to smash a grapefruit in a gang member's face near the film's end.  Comedies just don't get any funnier than SOME LIKE IT HOT, or better constructed and with such complex characters.<br /><br />And the Oscar-nominated B&W cinematography and art direction/set decoration are exquisite in their shadings of inky black, blinding white, and a dozen shades of gray. This is one of the most visually beautiful B&W movies I have ever seen, especially in a remastered print.<br /><br />Finally, this special edition of SOME LIKE IT HOT that cheered me up so much on Saturday night and that I am reviewing has almost 90 minutes of wonderful bonus material:  a lengthy chat with Leonard Maltin and Tony Curtis (who looks better now than in 1959); a fond reminiscence of the fabulously funny, never-topped train sequence by four surviving members of the Sweet Sue band; a Virtual Hall of Memories that has literally dozens of production stills taken on the set (including glimpses of the drag makeup in color and why the movie had to be shot in B&W); and original theatrical trailers for not just this Billy Wilder masterpiece, but also half a dozen other Wilder movies.  They will give you a glimpse at how much HOT has been restored visually and aurally.<br /><br />Is SOME LIKE IT HOT really the greatest comedy of all time?  There are so many other favorites of mine fighting for the same title, including TOOTSIE, DR. STRANGELOVE, something silent with Chaplin or Keaton or Lloyd, and especially Stanley Kramer's incomparable IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD.  But HOT is probably in my top five as an enduring masterpiece, now and always.  Watch this beautiful studio print DVD, the one with the bonuses, and feel wonderful toward the whole human race.  You will be laughing and giggling for days afterwards.</p></body></html>

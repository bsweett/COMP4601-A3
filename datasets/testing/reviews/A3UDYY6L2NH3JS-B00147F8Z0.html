Too much to suspend our disbelief for. The security space of the US is entirely open and a first extraterrestrial vessel can crash in some forest without raising any concern. A second vessel from the same cosmic origin can crash again without even raising an alarm. Impossible, except if we accept the very last sentence as being prophetic. "Ms. Yutani: The world isn't ready for this technology. Col. Stevens: But this isn't for our world, is it, Ms. Yutani?" Is this predator-weapon the technology that could pacify the world by killing the aliens that menace it, or is a good old nuclear bomb more effective? Some human leaders will prefer destroying their own kind provided they themselves can survive and keep the power they have even if it becomes a power over graves and tombstones, as long as they themselves are not the collateral victims. I think it could have been more effective with this punch line: "But this isn't FROM our world, is it, Ms Yutani?" I even think a Ms Hu, or a Ms Hussein would have been a lot more pungent. When you start thinking how a film could be improved, it sure means it is not very good. Maybe we should go back to John Wayne.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A COMPLETE cinematic experience.  Totally satisfying"></head><body><p>I saw this movie years ago when it first came out. Most movies aren't as good on second viewing.  I just saw it again on DVD and it is BETTER than I remember it. <p>The acting is superb, especially by the young William Wallace at the opening of the film.  Infact all the actors are excellent in this film.  <p>What really takes my breath away in this film is the stunning (pre-computer generated)scenery, music, costumes,  the sets and the magnificent battle scenes which really makes Bravehart a complete cinematic experience.<p>The DVD comes with an entertaining documentary on the making of the film with an excellent full length commentary by director/actor Mel Gibson.  A must in any DVD collection.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

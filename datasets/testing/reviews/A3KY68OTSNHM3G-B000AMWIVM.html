<meta name="summary" content="A Scary Thriller That's Loaded With Twists and Turns"></head><body><p>This film harkens back to the old days of horror films which were loaded with blood and good old-fashioned terror.  Many of today's horror films have left out much of the blood, but that is not the case with "Saw".<br /><br />Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) find themselves in a very dirty and unkept bathroom, each chained at opposite ends of the bathroom  to a pipe.  There is a dead man in the middle of the bathroom, lying in a pool of blood and clutching a tape recorder in one hand and a gun in the other.  After overcoming their initial shock, Lawrence and Adam decide that they must work together in order to get out alive. They begin to search the bathroom for anything that might help them escape, but the only items they find are two hacksaws that prove to be worthless in cutting through the chains that are holding each man to their respective pipes.  Each man discovers that they have a small cassette tape in their pockets.  After retrieving the cassette player from the dead man, Lawrence discovers that in order to survive, he must kill Adam before the clock on the wall reaches 6:00. Also, Lawrence finds out that his wife and daughter have been taken hostage, and they will be killed if Lawrence fails to kill Adam.  This sets off a desperate race against the clock to try to escape, as well as finding out the identity of their captor.  Will Lawrence and Adam survive?  Will Lawrence kill Adam?<br /><br />This movie is very good.  The plot is brilliantly conceived, and the twists and turns are definitely the highlight of the film.  A lot of good background information is provided in the flashbacks expreienced by Dr. Gordon.  The ending of the film was totally unexpected, and it will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The plot is extremely well conceived and the story is teriffic.  Watch this movie and try to guess what will happen next.</p></body></html>

Well you can obviously tell what Final Destination 3 is going to be right? Despite the contrivances, these films always offered the best gore-filled deaths around and this film doesn't skimp on it either. One thing you'll always love about these films is the gorefest involved, where it almost becomes giddyness when somebody gets off very gruesomely. It'll make you question your sanity at seeing such scenes but boy it's fun!<br /><br />A soon-to-be graduating class is out at the fairground and decide to get on a high rollercoaster. Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), yearbook student and self-described control freak, has a premonition where the rollercoaster kills everyone in it so she freaks out and people get off the ride but the ride still continues, leaving her boyfriend and best friend on. The crash goes according to plan and Wendy finds herself trying to save everyone's life when Death is after everyone who get off the ride and he's kinda ticked and dispatches them in gruesome ways.<br /><br />While bloodwise you would probably say the second one was the biggest, the third is arguably the most creative. Characters die in gruesomely bloody fashion and we get to see it. However there is one slight nitpick: they're a bit too elaborate. Instead of just a simple accident or a bad case of wrong place/wrong time, Death now is playing Mousetrap: Rube Goldberg-like scenarios where one thing knocks over another thing which turns on another thing that shorts another thing and it just goes until the character dies. It becomes a bit silly, and plus there is one big plothole: that of somebody's video camera. But there is some effective deaths including a nailgun and a tanning salon. But the tension for some reason gets kind of lost since Wendy, thanks to photographs she took night of the rollercoaster crash which contains clues to character demises, is aware of how everyone dies and it doesn't become as much a shock. See the glass pane boy from part 2 compared to tanning salon here: we're aware something nasty is going to happen in there and you end up almost waiting for the carnage.<br /><br />Acting-wise of course it's not the strongest although anything terrible makes it slightly better with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who manages to at least give some weight to what is essentially a plotless script (not to mention she's my new actress crush since, not only is she quite adept at acting but there's such a natural beauty about her). Everyone else though is not quite as stellar. Each one has 2 moods: their basic attitude towards everything (the jock who's kind of a jerk, the ditzy "like oh my gawd" mall wenches) and the disbelieving attitude they have when Wendy comes up to them and rants they're going to die.<br /><br />Extras-wise it's quite nice as we get a commentary with director James Wong and co-writer Glen Morgan, an almost hour-and-a-half long documentary about the film with some weirdly funny bits (for some reason, I got such a kick out of "chunky goodness"), a featurette about the dead teenager movie genre with discussion from historians and Roger Ebert and others. There is one weird addition and that is the "Choose Your Fate" version. Basically at certain points, the screen morphs into a screen where you can make a decision about an action a character can make in the film. It's a neat idea since you get to see more footage (and for me, more Winstead) but it's kind of a hassle since some decisions like the very first one inadvertedly stops the film really early while another is basically the same death just with one minor detail added. Also, if you watch the theatrical version, those moments cause a slight pause in some players.<br /><br />Unlike such films as Hostel or the Hills Have Eyes which were just pointless gore with a story that's going nowhere and taken too seriously, the Final Destination films know what kind of film it's going to be and does so with gusto. That of a gore galore film where you almost feel disturbed about how much of a kick you're getting out of characters getting the axe (figuratively though).</p></body></html>

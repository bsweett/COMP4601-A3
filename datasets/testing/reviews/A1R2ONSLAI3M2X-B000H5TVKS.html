From the opening scene when Michael finds himself one of Jigsaw's new victims and finds his head in a trap and forced to find the key to his head trap which we find out has been implanted behind his right eye, to the end of the movie when we find out who Jigsaw's accomplance is, it is a edge of your seat movie. Centered around a cop ( played by Donnie Wahlberg) who Jigsaw has targeted and is the common link between the people Jigsaw ( John ) has locked up in a room in an abandoned house, the movie delivers alot more than the original. The fact that Jigsaw has several more victims in this movie makes it much more interesting. We see Jigsaw who is dying of cancer and very bitter, still wanting to teach people the meaning and value of life. This movie like the first, forces people to see exactly what they would do to save their own life. With each victim's dying scene, it makes you wonder what WE would actually do to save our life. There was good acting in this movie and alot more action. Of course, with a surprise ending, it looks like there will be a Saw III in the works. If you are a fan of the first Saw, there is no doubt you will enjoy this one even more. It is definetly worth buying and owning. This is a sequel which is better than the first!</p></body></html>

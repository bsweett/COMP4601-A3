<meta name="summary" content="an excellent return to the classic western"></head><body><p>A Film By Kevin Costner<p>Open Range is easily the best western since Unforgiven, and no, it isn't the only western that has been made since Eastwood's masterpiece.  Open Range is a return to the classic western and should hold up very well in comparison to classic westerns.  It isn't quite as good as Unforgiven, but that was a genre defining (and almost ending) movie and very few movies are that good.  Thus far in 2003, Open Range is one of the year's best movies, but it may not make the final top ten list at year's end.<p>Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) and Charley Waite (Kevin Costner) at cattlemen.  They are also free grazers.  This means that they pass through the land, never staying anywhere and let their cattle graze anywhere they go, including on the property of other people.  Once, this was a common and accepted practice, but by 1882 people have become more property conscious and legal free grazing was falling out of favor with landowners.  As Boss and Charley are driving their cattle across the country, they have to send their hired man into town for supplies.  This sets up all of the action that is to follow as Mose (Abraham Benrubi) has problems with some of the townsfolk and when there is a murder of one of Boss's workers, Boss and Charley would rather stay and take care of business than be run off.  Boss has a line, "Cows is one thing, but one man telling another man where he can go in this country is something else."  That line pretty much boils down the main conflict between the rancher Baxter (Michael Gambon) and Boss.  The conflict is about the clash of the old ways with the new ways (free grazing vs private land, the old west vs new civilization) and both men are committed to their way of life.  Baxter, who is also crooked, pushes Boss too far.  <p>Charley has been working for Boss for 10 years after being a killer in the Civil War.  So, he is the perfect man for a fight.  For ten years Boss had given him the chance to live a better life, but he was never far away from the man who would kill with no second thoughts.  The movie presents a sort of emotional cat and mouse game between Boss and Baxter.  There are set up ambushes, reversals, good speeches to the townspeople on who to support and why, and to be honest this was an incredibly effective western where almost everything was working.  The gun battle near the end of the movie (which is just about all of the action, so expect a slow paced western when you see this) was outstanding.  One thing that Kevin Costner made a point to do was make sure that the gun shots were realistically loud.  Remember, there were no silencers on shot guns and six shooters back then.  If someone shoots, it is loud and it is frightening.  The gun fight was realistic and one of the highlights of the movie.  But even with the loud gun fights, the parts that make the movie are the quiet times where we see Boss and Charley interact with each other and with the land.  Nothing is rushed in this movie.  <p>The one thing that doesn't work in the movie is Charley's relationship with Sue Barlow (Annette Bening).  It feels a little forced and out of place.  Bening does what she can with the role, but there isn't much there and forcing the relationship feels out of place with the main thrust of the movie.  I understand why it was done, to show a change in Charley and a potential softening of his character, but it doesn't work as well as it should.  That was the only thing that I felt was lacking in the movie and I thought that Open Range was an excellent movie and should definitely be supported.</p></body></html>

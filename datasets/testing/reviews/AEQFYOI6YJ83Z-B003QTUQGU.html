And you'd think he would be the perfect fit to bring Lewis Carroll's psychedelic little novel to life.  And, if Burton and company had stuck to the novels, perhaps they would have a great film on their hands.  Alas, this film takes place AFTER Alice's initial visit to Wonderland.  Instead of the prepubescent charmer (borderline nymph) that inspired Carroll to tell his tale, we get a decidedly more mature Alice (no subtlety here).  She's come back to Wonderland, except the Mad Hatter (a minor character in the novels, a major player here) is the only one who's really sure.  But the Red Queen doesn't care if Alice is or isn't THE Alice.  Off with her head anyways!<br /><br />True, the visuals are amazing; I only saw it in 2D, and I was blown away.  But the rest of the film falls amazingly flat.  Even Johnny Depp, perhaps the most talented actor of his generation, doesn't seem to know what to do--to make the Hatter whimsical or serious?  (And what's with the break dancing?)  Mia Wasikowska proves she's got talent, but she doesn't have much to do here in the titular role.  We get some decent voice acting from Michael Sheen, and some genuinely fantastic voice acting from Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat (his performance alone, small as it is, is worth the ticket price).  Christopher Lee has one line (no kidding: one), and Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter, both amazingly talented actresses, are stuck in a rut here, never able to break free of their confines.  Crispin Glover, good as he usually is, just doesn't come off as too villainous; and Alan Rickman, as the Blue Caterpillar, is merely here for show; he's better than this and he knows it.<br /><br />Overall, ALICE IN WONDERLAND serves as a decent family film--kids won't care that the performances and stories lag, and parents will probably be enthralled with the visuals.  But for those of us craving a decent take on the book--well, there's always the old cartoon, still one of my personal faves.  Here's hoping the next Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration will be more noteworthy, like their prior efforts.</p></body></html>

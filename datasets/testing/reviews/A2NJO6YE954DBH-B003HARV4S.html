<meta name="summary" content=""The Illusionist" fools the right people at the right time"></head><body><p>Do you enjoy an illusion less when you know what is going on?  The inevitable question when watching a magic trick being performed is "How did they do that?"  From time to time there are those (e.g., Penn & Teller), who will reveal the secret behind the trick, and I have usually found that there is as much enjoyment in learning how they pulled it off as there is in watching the trick being performed in the first place.  Such a concern is at the heart of "The Illusionist," a 2006 film from writer-director Neil Burger ("Interview with an Assassin"), adapted from a short story by Steven Millhauser that draws some inspiration from the infamous Mayerling Incident but clearly goes its own way.<br /><br />We begin in Vienna at the previous turn of the century and a performance by Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton), at which the title character is arrested by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti).  Apparently Eisenheim is doing something he should not be doing, and all that is revealed throughout the rest of the film until we come full circle to the opening scene and understand its import.  We then learn that once upon a time the young Eisenheim had been friends with the young Sophie, but now he has grown up to be a master illusionist and the hottest thing in Vienna while she is the Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), the presumptive fiancee for Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), thereby setting the stage for a deadly love triangle.<br /><br />The Crown Prince is a paragon of arrogant rationality mixed with an indulgent temper who takes Eisenheim's illusions as an intellectual challenge but stops short of demanding Eisenheim tell how he does it.  Uhl is something of an amateur magician regarding card tricks and slight of hand, so he is also curious about the method behind the magic, but respects the professionalism of the performances, at least until the Crown Prince orders him to do otherwise as Sophie appears to be on the verge of choosing the Illusionist over the Crown Prince, a decision that will have deadly consequences.  Eisenheim's illusions are fascinating, but it is the human drama that matters more here.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" has the virtue of a talented cast in what is essentially an art house film (I am somewhat surprised that they all signed on for such a small and intimate period piece, although Biel clearly is trying to show she can act and following the leads of Norton and Giamatti in proving less is more).  This becomes crucial because I suspect most viewers will know the trick that is being played even if they are not sure how it is being pulled off, so Burger's film gets credit for making us more than willing to go along for the ride.  I have a preference for films that are able to fool me from start to finish, but I ended up rounding up on "The Illusionist" because I applaud the film's final scene and the joy of one character in figuring out how it was done.</p></body></html>

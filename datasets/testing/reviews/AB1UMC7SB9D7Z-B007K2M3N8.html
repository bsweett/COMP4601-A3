<meta name="summary" content="Great job by Kevin Spacey, everyone else not so much..."></head><body><p>As writer, director, singer, and actor in this film, Spacey's work is absolutely amazing.  His acting is perfect, the film fits together decently enough, he can actually sing, and hey, we care about his character enough.<br /><br />Further than that, this film doesn't really pay off.<br /><br />A musical biography of the musician Bobby Darin, this film attempts to explore his rise as a national star and his relationship with Sandra Dee.  Neither of those things are quite played out well.  For the story of his rise, it kind of goes right from him deciding to be a star (by his mother's influence) and then him just being a star.  As for his relationship with Sandra Dee, it doesn't seem believable and I wonder how much of it is based in actual fact.  Still, it's not like the film doesn't have a story.<br /><br />Kudos MUST be given to Spacey for his acting.  I couldn't tell what part of the personality was his or Darin's, so I could only assume it was actually how Darin was as a person.  Supporting acting is fine, only it's not as good as Spacey's, so it often causes a little dilemma on-screen while Spacey's trying to act off of someone else who's not acting as well as he is.  Perhaps someone else should have directed the other actors, but Spacey did as much as he could in front of and behind the camera.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></body></html>

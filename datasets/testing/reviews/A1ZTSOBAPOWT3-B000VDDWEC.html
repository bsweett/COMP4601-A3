In my opinion, survival of the fittest was developed early during human evolution as the lonely survivors (Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris) killed the plagued victims of RAGE and they had to build a new trust. Overall, the movie is creepy especially when Jim woke up from his coma to a deserted London and when he discovered bodies in the church. It's a great movie up to the point where Jim and his friends stumbled upon the military base to be saved. Even the military had become savages and had vile intentions for the women. Violence comes from humans as society is the order of their compulsions. Everything falls apart and the heroes are left stranded once again in seclusion from the world and the feeling of despair never enters their minds. This isn't a scary movie like the original &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; or one of those diabolical slashers, but it's a good movie with a surprising, meaningful message. If you're looking for watermelons or cherries falling out of people's necks or swarms of monsters chasing people all over the place, this isn't your movie. People will be disappointed. The moments of silence in the movie are really the most frightening. Then I realized that I actually live in the mountains and I became afraid of where I'm living. What if a bunch of insane monsters with bad breath and a crazed look in their eyes came running toward my house and crashed through my house just to spit on me? Then I wanted to hide my food. Wow, that's scary man. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; is a good movie.</p></body></html>

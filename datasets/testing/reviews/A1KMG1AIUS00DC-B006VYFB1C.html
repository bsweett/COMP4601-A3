<meta name="summary" content="Baseball by the Numbers"></head><body><p>"Moneyball"  is the story of the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his then-unheard-of policy of relying on cold statistics to acquire players who could score runs.  With a budget that prevented the team from snagging acknowledged top talent and competing with the deep pockets of the Yankees and Red Sox, Beane teams up with the Harvard-educated economist Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to rebuild the club and make it competitive.<br /><br />This is an unusual baseball movie since most of it takes place off the field and images of actual play do not dominate.  Performances are terrific, from Pitt's rebellious Beane, bucking the accumulated wisdom of his scouts who rely on their instincts and the age and physical condition of players, to Jonah Hill, who departs from his goofy sidekick roles to take on an actual, believable character.  The scenes between Pitt and Hill are especially enjoyable.  They have great chemistry.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays team manager Art Howe, a guy who clearly draws a line in the sand when it comes to game strategy and has little love or respect for Beane.<br /><br />Sports films always face the problem of appealing to a wide audience, and casting Pitt in the lead role is certainly one way to lick the problem.  The script by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin takes us into the offices of a mid-level major league baseball team, underscoring the tensions, resentments, disappointments, and resistance to new ideas.  Those who think baseball is only a game will see that it is big business predicated on taking chances on players who are undervalued, past their prime, or injured.<br /><br />A few scenes show Billy with his daughter (Kerris Dorsey) and ex-wife (Robin Wright), but they are incidental.  The movie really percolates when we see Billy working the phone with another general manager, trying to make the most advantageous deal, or when he has to move ahead with a method of team building that is contrary to the status quo.<br /><br />"Moneyball" is available in a two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack.  Bonus extras include a blooper reel and featurettes on the real Billy Beane, drafting the team, playing the game, and adapting the original book into film. The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.</p></body></html>

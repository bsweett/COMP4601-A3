Like some people I wanted to see this movie but got a little turned off because it was in black and white. Even though the picture is in black and white It's a nicely done picture. It's extremely smooth and crisp and it becomes beautiful when some color is added to make certain things stick out.<br />After seeing how well done it is you can't stop watching. It needed to be in black and white to show the ruggedness of the film and it really couldn't have been done any other way. Like instead of blood being red it was white and for some reason it looked cooler. The story is self-explanatory the name says it all but the twists in it are exciting and take the movie from good to great to amazing. It's a very violent and raw movie and you come to love it for that. Basically if you're looking for a movie that has a deep story and is in every way different than any other movie out then you need to see Sin City</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Super-Hero Movie for the Ages."></head><body><p>What makes a super-hero in myth? It can be anything from a landmark moment in a characters past or a discovery of a power that no other mortal posesses. You know the history and all the iconic names that go along with those origins, but what if you were just an ordinary person who felt the need to just help the innocent and just go out there and kick some evil ass? Well that is pretty much what Kick-Ass did.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is the story of an average comic loving nerd that suddenly felt two things needed to be done. Evil needed to be punished and he needed to get laid. So after many attempts he finally became the green and yellow scuba suit wearing hero 'Kick-Ass' What he didn't count on was that being a super-hero wasn't going to be such a cake walk. On his journey he encounters others who are out there vanquishing evil and it is not such an easy job.<br /><br />'Kick-Ass' as much as I was anticipating to see this movie ended up surpasing my expectations. I had never seen a movie that was as hystercially funny turn into such a slap-happy over the top gore-fest with some extremly serious moments as well. it was as if Quinten Tarantino directed Superbad. The acting was amazing and every actor gave 110%. I also loved the fact that there was a female character that girls could admire...not neceserally look up to because well Chloe Mortez is only 13 years old. Still, this movie is incredible it has huge laughs mind blowing fight scenes and it just oozes with awesomeness. And hey, how many times and the success of a movie based on a graphic novel cause the authors of the first to write a sequel and base a sequel film on it?</p></body></html>

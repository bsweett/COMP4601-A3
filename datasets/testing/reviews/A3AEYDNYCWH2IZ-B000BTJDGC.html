I usually like those movies that aren't all hyped up and this was one of them.This freaked me out more than the original Exorcist and I never thought another movie would. It doesn't steal any ideas from the Exorcist and has a pretty good ending, I thought. If you like horror movies that are more true to life and not the typical slasher movie, this is for you.</p></body></html>

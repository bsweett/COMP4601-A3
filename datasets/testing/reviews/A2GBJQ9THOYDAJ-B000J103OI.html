<meta name="summary" content="Streep makes a GREAT Wicked Witch . . . ."></head><body><p>Overall, this is a pretty good film, with Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs, the recent college grad trying to break into journalism who takes the only available job as junior assistant to the high-powered editor of the leading fashion magazine. She's earnest, and cute, and bright -- but Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, queen of fashionistas and priestess of the Dark Side of the Force, is spectacular. As the tagline says, Miranda is "hell on wheels." Sadistic, hyper-demanding, not knowing when to quit, lacking in the most basic humanity, willing to blow another marriage, happy to sacrifice everything and everyone around her, convinced that no one else in the universe is capable of doing her job. And yet "a million girls would kill" for Andy's job. It takes awhile, but Andy eventually (of course) discovers she's becoming too much like Miranda and manages to save herself at the last minute. It's a little too pat, but I enjoy watching the fashion industry being skewered.</p></body></html>

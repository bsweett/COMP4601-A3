The movie attempts to take the legend out of the Arthur story and place in within a semi-historical context.  The story the movie tells takes place towards the end of the Roman Empire (in fact, just about 25 years prior to Rome's actual fall) and just prior to the beginning of the Dark Ages that will sweep over most of Europe. Artorious Castus (Clive Owen), otherwise known as Arthur, is the leader of a special group of knights taken from their homeland by Rome and sent to the Empire's farthest realm, Brittain to defend the border along Hadrian's Wall for 15 years.<br /><br />Arthur has become a living legend in Brittain over the past 15 years and tales of his deeds have been told to the Pope in Rome. Arthur espouses a spirit of democracy, giving all a chance to speak, making plans together sitting around a round table. His methods are unorthodox, but successful and his men will follow him anywhere.  Lancelot, Galahad, Tristan, Gawain, and Bors are all that remain of the many who first sat at the table 15 years before.<br /><br />On the eve that Arthur and his knights are to be discharged, the Bishop gives them one last assignment.  Rome is abandoning Brittain to the Saxons. However, the Pope's favorite "son" and assumed heir, Alecto, are in danger of being killed by the invading Saxons. Arthur and his men are ordered to rescue the boy and his family and deliver them safe through Hadrian's Wall. It's a dangerous journey. Not only are the Saxon's a problem, but so are the natives--people Arthur have been fighting and killing for the past 15 years. But the times are changing and the land and people yearn to be united and to be free.<br /><br />KING ARTHUR has several things going for it.  First there is the acting. Clive Owen gives a great performance as Arthur, presented the legendary hero in a way not seen on screen before. There are several other good secondary performances (including Ray Winstone as Bors), but Keira Knightley is particularly interesting to watch as the pagan princess Guinevere.  The battles in the movie are quite action packed and enjoyable to watch. There's also a lot of great scenery. Then there's the concept, placing the Arthur story in a real historical context is something that really hasn't been done before.<br /><br />However, with all that KING ARTHUR has going for it, it suffers terribly from the one thing that ruins otherwise great movies more than any other, a bad script. The mission Arthur and his knights go on isn't all that cheesy and seems realistic.  The great battle literally on ice is a wonderful idea that was used to it's potential. However, it's all ruined by cheesy dialogue and copy-catism.  The last 20 minutes of KING ARTHUR (not including the final wedding scene) is a cheap rip-off right out of BRAVEHEART. Almost everything from Arthur's speech, to a sword in the ground, to the swelling score, and certain battle formations are copies that look almost identical to scenes from BRAVEHEART. Except, in KING ARTHUR the scenes come off as being comical (instead of a teeming army of poor Scotsman, Arthur delivers a passionate speech about not taking away our freedom to 4 knights). So much effort, wasted on one major scene and a few bad lines of dialogue and instead of getting a moving masterpiece on the possible historical King Arthur, we're left with an average movie that gives us an aftertaste of having seen this before in a much better way.<br /><br />This special edition of the DVD includes several features including an alternate ending, several featurettes, the usual director commentary, a knight trivia game, photo galleries, and an X-Box game demo.  I liked the trivia thing the most.</p></body></html>

But boy, does Atonement have one heck of a pay off.  In the end, I was more than a little choked up.  Knightley and Mcavoy are perfectly cast and Saoirse Ronan is a budding star if ever there was one.  IMHO, Director Joe Wright is more to be commended than screen writer Christopher Wright for this piece.  I think he took some bold risks that truly don't pay off until the end.  Highly, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

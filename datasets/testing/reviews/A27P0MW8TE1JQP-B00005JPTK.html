<meta name="summary" content="Scary, sad and some of Will Smith's best work!"></head><body><p>"I am Legend" is one of my favorite stories, it is the Grandfather of the Zombie genre, even though it is a vampire story, King and Romero have cited it as long time inspiration (King's most recent "Cell" as well,haveing been so borrowed from and seen so much film-versions already, I worried about what this latest project could bring worth retelling. But the imagery alone makes this worth seeing. The "Last Man on Earth" traveling through "real" NYC locales stark and empty while hunting CGI deer in a Muscle car is so striking, it will stay with us as moviegoers for some time to come. Like many of the moments in the film. Smith is in most every shot and spends much of the movie bouncing dialogue off dogs, dummies and the camera. He is superb in what may be his best dramatic performance yet.  He sells the character clinging to the tattered shreds of normalcy, swapping DVD like rentals at the corner store, watch old newscasts, etc. Purists of the original work maybe disgruntled by the changes made to the 50 year-old classic novel, but they make the movie a tighter, stark and relevant vehicle.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pixar Does It Again"></head><body><p>"Monsters, Inc." is a funny addition to anyone's Pixar library.  It's funnier than "A Bug's Life" and has a storyline that holds up better than "Toy Story."  Sully and Mike are a great duo in this tale and it's fun to watch them interact with each other and Boo.  The opening sequence in the test "Scare" room is funny, and the following sequence at Sully's house is hilarious.  Steve Buscemi is a standout as Randall, the conniving culprit of the movie.  He's devilishly funny and Mr. Waternoose isn't so bad either.<br />All of the monsters in this movie are designed with brilliancy.  None of them come across as too scary for youngsters to watch.  A cameo appearance by the "Abominable Snowman" leads to a funny moment with yellow sno-cones.<br />My 2 year-old wouldn't stop watching this movie for weeks after we purchased it, and now she's hooked on it again.<br />Humor for adults is included as well, but there is nothing offensive about any part of this movie.  It's fun for everyone in the house and will hold the attention of even the toughest two year old critics.</p></body></html>

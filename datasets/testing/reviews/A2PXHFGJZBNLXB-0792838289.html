<meta name="summary" content="Classic political thriller is still quite effective today"></head><body><p>In order to gear up for Jonathan Demme's upcoming remake of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, I recently caught up with John Frankenheimer's original 1962 film on Public Television (uncut and in widescreen, of course). I had seen this a few months back, but upon watching it a second time, it actually seemed even more brilliant than before.<br /><br /> I won't delve deep into the plot (you can read the Amazon.com review above for a plot summary). I will say that while I did find its satire of McCarthyism just a tad dated, it still has a vivid and even savage bite to it, particularly with its creation of the character of Senator John Iselin (James Gregory), who stands up during a press conference and declares that there are Communists among us. One scene in particular---one in which Iselin pleas with the ultra-controlling Mrs. Iselin (Angela Lansbury) to settle on an exact number of how many Communists there truly are in the State Department---is damn near priceless for its sharp wit. McCarthyism must have been a scary time for many, as mass hysteria took over common sense, and on that level THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE's attacks on it are still pretty potent today (even if it makes the film feel a bit more of its era than some might like).<br /><br /> I can't say I've seen Frank Sinatra in a great many films, but I would be surprised if he ever gave a better performance than he does here as Major Bennett Marco, who eventually pieces together the unspeakable plot of the movie. He brings intensity and some magnetism to the role, and he makes a likable protagonist. As for Laurence Harvey, he nails down Raymond Shaw's cold nature down pat, but when his character starts to bitterly reminisce about his lost love, Harvey is equally convincing in the flashback scenes as a more &quot;lovable&quot; Shaw. (You sorta feel for the poor guy at that point.) And of course Lansbury is memorably evil as Shaw's controlling mother---no wonder her character is considered one of the most memorable villains of the movies. Lansbury certainly doesn't underplay her part, but her performance never becomes distractingly over-the-top either. It's a genuinely classic performance.<br /><br /> You could quibble with the plausibility of the central premise, or even if some of the female characters are absolutely necessary to the plot (I never really figured out why Janet Leigh's Eugenie was in the film---unless of course she was also a controller of some sort, an angle that the movie hardly dwells on). Still, in the face of the intelligent thrills Frankenheimer & co. generate with the premise, those reservations count for little indeed. This is truly one of the classic modern thrillers.<br /><br /> Let's hope the upcoming remake is at least worthy to stand alongside its company.</p></body></html>

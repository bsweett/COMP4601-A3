The things Ernesto saw and the people he met along the way would wind up changing not only his life but the lives of the countless people who were soon to become his followers.  For that man would become known to history as `Che' Guevara, the Marxist revolutionary who, to this day, for good or for ill, remains an iconic figure to many downtrodden and oppressed peoples of the world - and a symbol of Communist tyranny to others.<br /><br />"The Motorcycle Diaries" is based on Guevara's own writings about the trip.  Even so, the film is never totally successful at showing how this rather modest young man became one of the world's leading revolutionary figures.  Although the movie is extremely well made from a technical standpoint, the first half plays like any other road trip movie, chronicling the boys' encounters with various people and their mishaps with the motorcycle.  In the second half, however, we begin to see the stirring of a social conscience in Guevara that would become the focal point of all his future activities.  As he encounters more and more indigent people suffering at the hands of an indifferent ruling class, Guevara becomes acutely aware of the great divide that exists between wealth and poverty in the world and the great human and social injustice that such a gulf leads to.  As a result, the second half of the movie is more interesting than the first.  However, even here, something seems to be missing.  Is it that we just don't see enough real suffering on the part of the people Guevara encounters?  Or is it that Gael Garcia Bernal, fine actor though he is, is simply too passive, too much an observer to convince us that his character would later go on to become such a key mover of world events?<br /><br />This is not to say that "The Motorcycle Diaries" doesn't have moments of great beauty and power, only that it never reveals much to us about the interior workings of the man who is its subject.  In addition to the confident directing by Walter Salles and the fluid editing and camerawork, the film has a rich musical score, filled with flavorful Spanish rhythms, provided by Gustavo Santaolalla, who recently won an Academy Award for his even more beautiful work in "Brokeback Mountain."<br /><br />Even 46 years after his death, Guevara still remains a lightning rod for controversy, with as many people lining up to despise him as to honor him.  Certainly the Castro revolution in Cuba, in which Guevara played so prominent a part, hardly led to a land of plenty or a life of freedom for the horribly oppressed people there.  "The Motorcycle Diaries," because it only covers Guevara's pre-revolutionary years, is able to bypass all that messiness and paint the man in largely glowing and positive terms.  Thus, the movie fails to catch the irony of a man who began as a defender of oppressed people eventually helping to install a system in which his own group became the oppressors themselves.  A movie on that subject might make for a more searching and pointed film than this one turns out to be, but "The Motorcycle Diaries" still has much to recommend it.</p></body></html>

With "The Passion of the Christ," Gibson proved that a film can be great even if the audience has to rely on subtitles to get them through the film.  In "Apocalypto," Gibson proves it once more.  Although this is a stretch, I'd have to say that Gibson's story here is much like that of William Shakespeare's plays in that you do not have to understand the language in order to understand the story.  The story is told through the eyes, actions, and emotions of each character.  In "Apocalypto," we are introduced to Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his close-knit tribal family.  The story begins with tribal members hunting tapir.  We are introduced to Jaguar Paw's brother, Blunted, and his father.  Though few of the characters are named, we learn quickly who they are and have a relationship with each of them.  Warriors from another, more powerful tribe, attack the village, take prisoners, and abandoned the children.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and son in an empty well and vows to return for them.  From there, the story moves to the giant Mexican pyramids and the blood-encrusted culture that base their lives around it.  We see slavery, political and religious manipulation and flat-out cruelty.<br /><br />At this point, the story enters its second phase, where a great chase ensues as a prophecy unravels before the Mayan people's eyes.  We are also given a potential clue as to why this complicated and advanced society suddenly vanished.<br /><br />Perhaps it's not as historically accurate as others would want, but when you boil it down to the basics, "Apocalypto" is two separate stories combined into one.  On one hand you have a tale of a family whose love for one another keeps them going.  On the other hand you have a great chase tale that will hold you in your seat for the entire running time of the film.<br /><br />Gibson has done a masterful job with this film.  He's taken core characters with minimal dialogue and created great heroes and villains with them.  The actors and actresses in this film perfectly exude their respective intentions flawlessly.  You immediately pick up on who's the strong-hearted warrior, who's the honorable and loyal father, who's the sinister, cruel underling, and who's the primary villain.<br /><br />Well done flick that deserves repeat viewings.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

The only reason I picked this up was because I have a thing for Garrett Hedlund as eye candy and I am a fan of Billy Bob Thornton.  I could care less about a football movie.  Still, this was a good movie.  Following in the footsteps of the great sports movies (The Natural, Rudy, Rocky, etc.), we are rooting for the underdog and feeling a great joy when someone triumphs over a great obsticle.<br /><br />We are following the 1988 high school football season of the Panthers in a small Texas town.  We are in America's heartland, Texas, a state that practically throbs with national pride and a love of football.  Football is important, and you feel the exuberance of all the star team members as they interact with the townsfolk and media.  Each has their own struggle, Garret Hedlund's probably being the most with an abusive father (Time McGraw) and his obvious popularity with the girls (gotta love that scene where the girl gives him a Rice Krispy sculpture!).  Billy Bob is a stereotypical hard nosed coach, gruff and demanding.  He pushes them as hard as he can.  And they triumph.<br /><br />A great feel good movie about overcoming.  It just happens to be a sports movie too.</p></body></html>

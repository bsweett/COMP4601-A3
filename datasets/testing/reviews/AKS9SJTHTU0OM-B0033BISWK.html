<meta name="summary" content="A commercial action sci-fi film that's also smart, political, darkly funny, and at moments very touching,"></head><body><p>Blomkamp does the amazing by combing roller coaster excitement with an intelligent context that makes all the noise about something.<br />While some of the ideas are occasionally heavy handed or on the nose, it's so exciting to see a Hollywood action film that traffics in ideas,<br />that I'm willing to forgive the occasional 'I get it already' moment, or logic lapse, or easy coincidence, or mediocre supporting performance.<br /><br />The story is simple. A million plus grotesque looking, starving and sickly aliens get stranded on Earth when they essentially run out of<br />fuel. And while at first humans try to reach out in friendship, before long corporations are trying to make money by exploiting their<br />technology (especially, or course, their weapons) and the aliens are herded into a 'district' and walled in. (That the film is set in South<br />Africa is one of those choices that feels like gilding the lily - even though that is the film-maker's home). And it's clear that progressing<br />from apartheid to Nazi style medical experiments and concentration camps is the next step.<br /><br />While I wish the villains were less mustache twirling (some 'banality of evil' would have been even more chilling), the effects are great,<br />and it's a film that grew, not shrank as it went along. For the first third I thought it was OK, the second pretty good, and by the end I<br />loved it.  And it's stuck with me.</p></body></html>

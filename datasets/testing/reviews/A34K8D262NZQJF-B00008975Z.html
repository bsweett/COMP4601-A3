<meta name="summary" content="A classic on a criminal clique!"></head><body><p>This movie does not contain that much action but the dialogue is great and holds well. The action takes place near the end which is kind of important because without the action the truth would not be revealed to some of the characters. Anyways it's about 5 guys planning to do a heist , except one of them is a cop. So the movie goes through each character's angle on the heist until each angle equals a scene in which a face off takes place with every character going against eachother to find out why their perfect plan whent so horribly wrong. This film is a must have for Tarantino fans everywhere and a definte must see for anyone looking for a film that makes you assume the roles and actions but makes you keep on guessing the whole time!</p></body></html>

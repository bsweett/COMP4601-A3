<meta name="summary" content="Vampires and werewolves, not cowboys and Indians"></head><body><p>I watched this movie on cable, and when I went to pro.imdb.com to see if it had been released to theaters or was a direct to DVD release, I was surprised to see that it had opened in the theaters with twenty million, made fifty million total in the U.S., and added another forty-five million in DVD/Video rentals! I honestly thought, given what I perceived to be some imperfections, that it may have been a direct to DVD release.<br /><br />While watching the film I was impressed by the lighting, the cinematography, costumes (although why Selene was often dressed like Catwoman didn't make much sense), artwork - in other words, the things that make a film look good. I was also intrigued by the concept of a vampire/werewolf hybrid.<br /><br />However, if I hadn't read in the movie guide that this was a film about hybrids, I would have been lost. Vampires and werewolves looked the same to me. Perhaps there was a bulging of teeth that the vampires had that the werewolves didn't - truthfully, I don't remember. What I do remember was Lucian - as a human - biting another human and turning him.<br /><br />There is an interesting twist in the storyline that I didn't see coming, and so I give praise to the writer(s) for that. However, the story sagged in many places.<br /><br />This is a story about werewolves and vampires. Why did it look like they were cowboys and Indians, having long drawn out shoot-outs? Vampires and werewolves have extraordinary powers: *use them*! I understand that the vampires were shooting with silver bullets, which are anathema to werewolves and perhaps their best weapon (in that movie) against them, and that the werewolves MAY have been shooting the bullets made of concentrated daylight (neat idea - but it wasn't developed at all), but still: battles between vampires and werewolves would have made for more exciting action. When a werewolf attacked Viktor, and he caught it by its throat, there was real tension. The first real tension I experienced, in fact, regarding the feud between werewolves and vampires. That tension came far too late in the film. During the gunfights, there was no tension. For me, gunfights lost their appeal somewhere after The Lone Ranger.<br /><br />Also, Selene goes to great risk to save Michael, whom she apparently loves, but aside from the fact that she's hot, and he's hot, I have no idea why they liked each other. Sure, this is a "monster movie", but if there's going to be a love interest that is *really* the center of the story (think about it - if Selene didn't have feelings for Michael, there wouldn't have been a story to tell), then we need to know more about it.<br /><br />All of my complaining aside, I did enjoy the film; especially the intriguing plot twist and the climax. Interestingly, there wasn't much of a d&eacute;nouement - just a climax. I guess the d&eacute;nouement was Selene's voice-over telling us that there would be a sequel although, of course, she didn't use those words. And there will be a sequel.<br /><br />The hybrid concept was terrific - and the result of that experiment was, for lack of better description, really cool. For that reason alone I'll see the sequel. I just hope it's not another round of cowboys and Indians.</p></body></html>

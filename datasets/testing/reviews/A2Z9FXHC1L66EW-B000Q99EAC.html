<meta name="summary" content="A Fitting End To The Rocky Balboa Saga!"></head><body><p>When it was revealed that there was going to be a Rocky VI, many naysayers groaned and complained that enough was enough and that Sly was too over the hill and couldn't pull it off.  But the TRUE FANS out there knew differently.  Even the critics, who initially made skeptical/negative comments about the sixth installment, started turning their stories around after viewing the film in its entirety.  Rocky Balboa is a real winner of a movie, that fully realizes the essence of the original classic and brings the saga full circle to a thrilling, emotional, and very memorable conclusion.<br /><br />Many years have gone by since last we saw Rocky, who is now a widower, estranged from his son and still mourning the loss of his beloved wife, Adrian.  There are some truly touching moments of Rocky at the cemetery, sitting by her grave (when I saw the film in theaters, no one in the audience made a sound - even the rowdy ones - during these scenes, out of pure respect for the characters) as well as Rocky's journey, with Paulie, to all the places he took Adrian on their classic first date.  So touching.<br /><br />Now Rocky has his own restaurant, where he greets his customers and regales them with past stories of glory.  But deep inside of him is a rage that he must get out of himself and conquer in order to move on with his life.  The only way to do that is to go back in the ring.  But when a computer simulated match between Rocky and the current reigning heavyweight champion of the world, Mason Dixon, is shown on TV, showing Rocky as the victor, word spreads like wildfire for the real thing.<br /><br />No Rocky film is complete without a training montage, and this film's got it in spades.  Stallone has the character of Rocky so integrated within himself, and gives nothing short of one of his finest performances on screen.  Many memorable scenes, including Rocky's long and emotional talk with his son, as well as his new relationship with Marie (the young woman Rocky walked home back in the first installment) make for truly compelling drama.  And the climactic fight at the finale is the icing on the cake.  It's inspirational and never disappoints for a second.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa belongs in the collection of every fan (and non-fan alike for that matter) and the DVD is loaded with wonderful bonus features, including Audio Commentary with Stallone, Deleted Scenes, Featurettes, Alternate Ending, and more.  Pick this film up and watch it again and again.  You'll be happy you did.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa - a fitting end to the Rocky Saga!<br /><br />"But it ain't about how hard you hit.  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." - Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Prepare for impact!"></head><body><p>This film paved the way for other world-obliterating movies such as Armageddon and Dante's Peak. OK, I know they're not technically all the same, but they are very similar. Armageddon is one of my favourite movies, and I can see a lot of similarities between that &amp; Independence Day. <p>I don't know why I've only decided to watch this movie nearly eight years after its original release. I will admit to reading the book based on the movie. That could have put me off seeing the movie, as it was mind-numbingly boring. But when I watched the movie, I found myself recognising characters and knowing what was going to happen to them, and recognising the lines too. So obviously the book had some impact on me, despite sending me to sleep most nights. <p>I was shocked to read that this was the biggest box office success of 1996 - you'd think something like that would tempt me to go and see it at the cinema! I saw Titanic twice at the cinema, and watched the video about a zillion more times. Independence Day grossed about $746m around the world, and a mere $306m alone in the USA. <p>There are some spectacular effects in this, including seeing The White House getting blown up, LA/New York etc being reduced to rubble (very Terminator-esque) and some very cute aliens appear in a lab (are they available to buy?)<p>Some great actors appear in this film - Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum being his usual eccentric self, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin and . . . Harry Connick Jnr?! There has to be some mistake there. Will Smith was great in this, although there was a big sigh of disappointment when he got out of the bed wearing boxers. Damn. <p>This must have been great to see at the cinema. The sound is fantastic watching it on DVD with a great sound system. I was fearing for the neighbours next door, as my chair was shuddering beneath me, and took a few minutes before the vibrations stopped! Of course, with a great sound system, whether in the cinema or at home, there were nearly a few accidents. I literally jumped out my skin a couple of times, and to persuade my heart to go back to its usual place in my body, rather than in my throat! <p>If you haven't seen this film, you have to go and see it. It's really fantastic, and I'll definitely consider getting it on DVD.</p></body></html>

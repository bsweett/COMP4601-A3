<meta name="summary" content="Wonderfully Artistic Fantasy"></head><body><p>I very much loved the first HELLBOY movie, but the sequel made nightmares beautiful ( which has become something of a trademark of Guillermo Del Toro's ). The sets, costumes, makeup, and lighting were sumptuous, mysterious, and lush.<br /><br />I generally find most comic book characters to be rather cardboardish when they're transferred to celluloid, or plastic ( HANCOCK comes to mind, or the FEEBLE 4 ). Ron Perlman , Selma Blair, and Doug Jones managed to make their characters breathe. Luke Goss was fascinating as Prince Nuada, and Anna Walton was equally captivating as his twin sister.<br /><br />I was particularly drawn to the dichotomies in the plot. The best example of this, I believe, is Prince Nuada, a character that is quite as much an anti-hero as Hellboy ( Perlman ), though he is utterly ruthless in his methods of dealing with the 'greedy humans,' even killing his own father in a last ditch attempt ( as he obviously sees things ) to save the world he loves.<br /><br />Although there are pathos in it, there is quite a bit of humor in this film ( HELLBOY, and Abe drunkenly crooning along to an insipid Barry Manilow song was hilarious ). The action was fun, and a lot less CGI-heavy than most action films based on comic books today seem to be.<br /><br />I enjoyed it as much as V FOR VENDETTA, or DARK CITY.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""If I Should Fall, Remember What You See Here.""></head><body><p>Glory is one of the most powerful war films ever made as well as one of my all-time favorite films.  And the quote given by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, "If I should fall, remember what you see here," speaks volumes for the courage and bravery of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment as well as for all Negro soldiers who have ever served in the military to fight for this country.<br /><br />Aptly titled, "Glory" references the impact that these men had upon history.  It doesn't matter that they were unsuccessful in taking Fort Wagner.  What matters is that in that assault, they earned the respect of many of the white soldiers and men who witnessed their courageous attempt.  Why is this so pivotal?  Because during that time period, even their white allies viewed the Negro soldier as being useless in a fight.  Remember that most people felt that they were largely inferior.  The assault on Fort Wagner proved them wrong, and at least, this began a change in views about the value of Negro soldiers, in not only the Civil War, but in subsequent wars that followed.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick leads and all-star cast as Robert Gould Shaw in this epic film about a young, white abolitionist from Boston who is offered command of the 54th Massachusetts regiment...one of the first all-Negro regiments to serve in the Civil War for the Union.  Shaw initially shows his inexperience as a commanding officer.  He makes mistakes, but he is quickly able to win the hearts of the men he commands.  His ideal is in the right place, as he tries to not only train them, but to understand them.  Even many of his officers don't believe that the 54th will ever see combat.  Shaw feels that it is his duty to prepare them, and prepare them properly, as evidenced in a wonderful scene in which he chews out his best friend and XO, Major Forbes, for not teaching the men how to use a rifle properly.<br /><br />Denzel Washington, who earned a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar, plays a runaway slave, Trip, who embodies the heart and soul of the regiment.  He's an angry man, and one can hardly blame him once we see the wounds on his back from repeated beatings.  He's full of anger and hatred, and he desperately wants to fight, even though a large part of him thinks that it will all be for nothing (how ironic considering that African-Americans would not be given their true rights and freedom by the government for nearly 100 years).  Denzel is perfect in the role, especially during the whipping scene in which a continued, painful stare is held until a single tear falls from his face.  It's one of the best scenes in the entire film.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is equally riveting as another runaway slave, John Rawlins, who has been living in the North for a number of years, working as a grave-digger, and wondering when, if ever, he would be given the opportunity to fight.  Rawlins's prime role is not only in helping Shaw relate to the men, but also in looking out for the men as well.<br /><br />At first, Shaw finds himself having to push against the system to get even the most basic needs for his men, such as shoes and socks (considering most of his men are either barefoot, or have shoes that barely function).  When he finds that his men are only being used for slave labor, as well as for helping to illegaly pillage southern towns, he finally uses his powerful government connections to put pressure on the general to allow his men to fight.<br /><br />This film has so many powerful and touching moments, I could fill up pages relaying them all to you.  One of my favorites, is the men singing the night before the assault on Fort Wagner.  They are singing around a campfire and asking the Lord for his blessings.<br /><br /> Another, is Shaw on the beach, realizing that he probably won't be coming back from what seems to be an almost suicidal mission.  However, Shaw realizes, that regardless of the outcome of the battle, a great victory is on the verge of being won even though he is fighting through his own fear of an almost certain death. And this is why he says those epic words to the reporter as he hands over his journals, "If I should fall, remember what you see here."<br /><br />I must mention that powerful music that accompanies this film by James Horner.  Using the Harlem Boys Choir, he gives the film and almost haunting sound, as if these men are calling to us from the past; to demonstrate that they didn't die in vain, but paved the way for every African American soldier who would ever help to fight for the freedoms of this country.</p></body></html>

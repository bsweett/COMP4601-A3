<meta name="summary" content="A disappointing mess from Equilibrium's director"></head><body><p>Kurt Wimmer first burst on to the scene with the stylish, dystopic Equilibrium. This little-seen film when it was first released in the theaters soon garnered a cult following once on DVD. What was not to like about Wimmer's directorial debut. It had stylish action, a plot seemningly taken out from an Orwellian playbook and a cast of good to great performances. This sophomore effort from Wimmer got my interest the moment I read about it in the trades. It seemed like a continuation of his take on future dystopia but with a medical twist. I expected alot, though not too much that I overhyped the film to even myself, but what I finally saw once the film hit the theater was something that was a total mess.<br /><br />Ultraviolet takes place in another future dystopia where the world became ruled by a medical establishment that's become religiously fanatical in its quest to protect the world from a plague that genetically-resequenced humans into vampire-like beings called Hemophages. The main character Violet, as played by genre favorite Milla Jovovich, is such a being who is now a member of a dying and hunted species. Violet would've been a cool character if she was abit more fleshed out, so to speak. The character in the film was pretty much indestructible despite the growing odds she had to go up against. I understood from the intro sequence that Ultraviolet was playing on the comic-book style of storytelling and characterization, but Wimmer went overboard in making Violet too Ultra. The story itself doesn't even rise to the level of basic barebones. The ideas presented in the film were still interesting, but it seemed that the audience entered the film sometime during the middle part of the story. So many ideas were being forcefed to the audience through medical mumbo-jumbo that after awhile I just tuned it out. The story pretty much rushed from one talky scene to the next with techno-soundtracked action sequences filling out the gaps.<br /><br />The action looks to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium. As much as it would've looked cool in Ultraviolet, the PG-13 rating meant no blood and all the kills done so cleanly or offscreen that one almost thought they were watching something made-for-tv. Kurt Wimmer does know how to create action scenes. One in particular involves Violet on a motorcycle against several helicopter gunships. This was the only scene in the film where I actually enjoyed what I was watching. The soft, dreamlike look of the film even gave the sequence a very surrealistic feel to it. But in the end it wasn't enough to save the film. The rest of the action scenes look to be too choreographed and again the bloodless look to them didn't exactly make them better. Milla Jovovich did look good as Violet and earning a reputation as the premiere female action star, but she could've done and chosen a better project to showcase her talents.<br /><br />Wimmer really regressed alot with this second film, but rumors abound that it might not be all his fault. I don't doubt that talks of the studio getting overly involved in the editing and writing process of the film could've led to the mess that was the fiished product. It's just hard to see how a talented, up-and-coming action director like Wimmer could go from Equilibrium to Ultraviolet in such a short time. Ultraviolet looked like a film that had great intentions when it first began but ended up looking lost and deflated by the time the credits rolled. Here's to hoping that Kurt Wimmer learns from this debacle and goes back to doing what made Equilibrium a cult-fave instead of the stuff he did that made Ultraviolet awful.</p></body></html>

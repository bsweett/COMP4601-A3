<meta name="summary" content="I did not think about this movie after I left the theater"></head><body><p>While this movie did have some philosophical questions as to how far one will go to get what he wants it left me feeling like there should have been more presented in the movie.  I did not think on this movie for days like I have some in the past.  Samuel L. Jackson turned in a fine performance and Ben Affleck's was equally engrossing.  For Affleck's character to have a 100% turnaround at the ending and do the things he did for Jackson's character are unbelievable.  Without giving away too much of what happens it is just not feasible, in my opinion, to go to the depths that these characters did only to end up where they were at the end of the movie.  Maybe they were trying to show that good men and bad men are each less so than they appear.  <p>Unfortunately I left the theater feeling that I had seen the best parts of the movie in the previews and thinking to myself, "was that it?" "I thought there should have been more to it."  <p>Final assessemnt - wait for the video.</p></body></html>

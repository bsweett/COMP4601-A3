<meta name="summary" content="Not the greatest film ever--but still a good movie"></head><body><p>Following the death of media mogul Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), a reporter (Joseph Cotten) is tasked with investigating the significance of Kane's final word: "Rosebud."  It is impossible to merely enjoy this film because of its reputation as the greatest ever made.  I felt like I was forced to react to this exalted status.  Well, I have to conclude that it is probably impossible to single out any movie as the best, but if I had to it wouldn't be "Citizen Kane."<br /><br />This is not to say that I thought it was a bad movie at all.  However, Welles's innovative use of the camera, which causes so many to regard it so highly, was so relentless that I was frequently pulled out of the story to consider the artifice of it, making it feel rather cold and technical.  I found the story involving, even though I couldn't really connect with the characters, and would still recommend it.</p></body></html>

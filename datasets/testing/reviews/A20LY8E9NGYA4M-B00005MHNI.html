<meta name="summary" content="A CONTROVERSIAL STUDY OF THE VIOLENT SIDE OF THE HUMAN BEING"></head><body><p>One of the biggest complaints about "A Clockwork Orange", is the use of excessive violence. It's a shame, but let's face it: the violence is part of the human nature, it's an ugly side of our behavior, but it's useless to pretend that someone can't have violent thoughts once in a while. So I recommend to all those people that blame movies (like "A Clockwork Orange") for the violence all around the world, please read any Universal History book. Perhaps you might realize that the human race has a violent side by nature: wars, territorial invasions, betrayals, you name it, violence was here before the movies. "A Clockwork Orange" explores the violent side of the human being.<p>"A Clockwork Orange" shows the dark side of our nature, and the attempts made by the society to repress that dark side through the excessive control of the individuals. The main character, Alex (Malcolm McDowell, in a very charismatic performance) is a young man that enjoys life, but with violence and excesses. Usually, a character like Alex would be hated by the audience, but our antihero is so human, with so many sides, attitudes and personalities, that without a doubt he is an excellent example of the complexity of the human being.<p>One of the readings of "A Clockwork Orange" is: every person has a negative side and a positive side, everybody. Throughout the movie, we see that Alex is more than a bully, he is a person with all the flaws, needs and suffering, proper of the human being. Also, in "A Clockwork Orange", we can see that all our actions will have consequences, no matter if we act right or wrong. Alex acts wrong, but he also pays a high price in the movie.<p>One of the strongest highlights in "A Clockwork Orange" is the masterful use of music to improve the scenes. Music by Beethoven, Rossini, Walter Carlos and, oh yeah, a disturbing version of "Singing In The Rain", helped to create some of the most memorable scenes in film history. <p>"A Clockwork Orange" is one of the most important films of all time, in most of film critics "100 best movies of all-time" lists, we can read the name "A Clockwork Orange", proof of the transcendence of the movie. It's also the best movie made by Stanley Kubrick (in my humble opinion). It has a little of everything: action, comedy, satire, drama, excellent music, very creative dialogues, a very charismatic central character, and oh yeah, something that may confuse people that enjoy movies with MTV pace and one page scripts: A PLOT. If you can't notice the excellent portrait of the complexity of the human being in this film, I recommend you to try "American Pie", "Ernest Goes To Jail" or "Gigli". The rest of us, let's enjoy "A Clockwork Orange".</p></body></html>

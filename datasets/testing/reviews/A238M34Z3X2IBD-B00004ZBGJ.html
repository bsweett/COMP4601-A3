<meta name="summary" content="A RARE BOX SET"></head><body><p>It's all in one box.  You can not get any better than that.  All five movies are here and brought back to life with a fine transfer, excellent  sound and in widescreen as well.  As you may have heard and have read only  the first 100,000 box set editions will include the AMC original: BEHIND  THE PLANET OF THE APES, a two hour retrospective produce by and for AMC  when they hosted the showing of the remastered APES films.  The special is  more than worth the price of the box set alone.  Well produced, documented  and hosted by the late Roddy McDowall (FRIGH NIGHT), it's gives everything  you ever wanted to know about the APES movies and more.  As for the films  themselves... they still hold up.  As far as bells and whistles and extra's  - each individual DVD has little to play with.  Previews of all five films  are present on each DVD and that is about it.  It may not seem like much,  but the AMC special is worth it.  I recommend the box set, a very worth  addition to any DVD collection.  Do not let this one pass you by.</p></body></html>

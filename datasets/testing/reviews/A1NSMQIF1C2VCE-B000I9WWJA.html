<meta name="summary" content="A three-and-a-half stars Spike Lee Joint"></head><body><p>This fourth Spike Lee/Denzel Washington collaboration in many ways is the most conventional and the one that has the least to do with Spike's own voice -- he's operating off a thriller script he did not create -- but there are still signs that "Inside Man" is still a Spike Lee Joint.<br /><br />There's the signature shot of a protagonist moving down the street on a rolling cart instead of walking, an off-hand discussion of the damage done by videogames that glamorize the gangsta lifestyle and, as always, a lot of Spike's signature camera work and camera shots. For big Spike Lee fans, this might not be as much Spike as they want, but the film is still definitely worth watching.<br /><br />It's a smart thriller, not so much a "whodunnit" as a "what, exactly, did they do?" Clive Owen appears at the very beginning of the film, laying out what's happened in the film, with an implicit challenge to the viewers to figure out exactly what they're about to see. The bank robbery that follows is mysterious and more clever than it at first appears to be and the entire affair takes on extra realism thanks to an extremely good cast, including a number of lower-tier character actors putting in solid work, and especially Christopher Plummer and a surprisingly disquieting Jodie Foster, playing against type.<br /><br />The final resolution doesn't have quite the emotional pop that may have been intended, but it's an intellectually satisfying one.<br /><br />"Inside Man" could have used more of Spike Lee's signature style to spice things up, but it's still a very solid little caper movie and well worth seeing for fans of such films or Spike Lee Joints.</p></body></html>

And on those merits, it's a darned effective movie.  When you rented or bought this movie, what exactly were you looking for?  If you want realistic, true to life stuff, go to the Discovery or Weather Channel.  This is fiction, people, and I for one didn't buy it to see any extraordinary acting or plotline.  I wanted to see the effects...hail as big as grapefruits; tornadoes ravaging Los Angeles; New York flooding and freezing.  That's why I bought this movie and was not the least bit disappointed.  Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward, Dash Mihok, Kenneth Welsh, Jake Glyenhaal, Emmy Rossum...they all did fine, because they knew the audience would root for them no matter how ridiculous their dialogue was.<br /><br />So sit back, eat some popcorn and just marvel at these state of the art effects in the best disaster movie in years!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a epic of big soggy proportions... Alexander stinks"></head><body><p>Suave Actor Colin Farrell (upcoming The New World, Intermission) steps up into the boots of the lead role of Alexander The Great who conquered a lot of places on the map and who has had a difficult life, with his over protective mother, played by Angelina Jolie (upcoming Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Beyond Borders) in a throwaway role...I didnt believe that Jolie could pull off playing Farrell's mother. 'Lexander also when he was a wee one lost his father King Philip, played by the cool Val Kilmer (Mind Hunters, The Doors)...even Kilmer cant pull off anything good. Alexander's story is told by the great low voice of Anthony Hopkins (The Human Stain, Hannibal). We learn that Alexander might have some homoerotic ways, having feelings for his friend, played by Jared Leto (Panic Room, Urban Legend). The empty action picture also stars Rosario Dawson (Frank Miller's Sin City, KIDS) and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis '05, Velvet Goldmine). To say this is a masterpiece is surely laughable...it doesnt even hit that mark. Farrell's performance cant make the cut. Oliver Stone sprinkles in some red in a gigantic battle between Elephants...and who needed that red, anyway....I was thinking Alexander Born Killer when that red popped up. A grand failure in many ways though it isnt the worst movie of 2004...it just plain stinks like rotted fish.</p></body></html>

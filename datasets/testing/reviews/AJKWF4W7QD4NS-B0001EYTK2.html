In the late 70's, four kids go cross country and come across hearing the legend of Dr. Satan; an insane doctor who performed ghoulish experiments on his patients. Soon they pick up a hitchhiker (the oh so hot Sheri Moon; Rob Zombie's real life girlfriend), and from this point any veteran fan of horror films knows whats going to happen next. Soon we meet her family which includes Trilogy of Terror vixen Karen Black and the always excellent Bill Moseley. Next there are plenty of predictable scares followed by some nice gore and make up effects, and the film bares a stunning resemblance to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Zombie partly succeeded his intention; to make a truly scary horror film like the ones of old, and while House of 1000 Corpses isn't the most brilliant piece of horror film (or the most intelligent for that matter), it's a fun ride nonetheless, and Zombie shows some true directorial talent. The performances are great with Moseley stealing the entire show, his performance bearing striking similarities to his zany and hilarious deliverance of Chop Top in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, and the cast also includes a foul mouthed clown faced Sid Haig and a southern drawl spewing Walt Goggins (Shane on TV's The Shield). All in all, House of 1000 Corpses is a gritty little movie that horror buffs will find some appreciation for. If you find you like this check out older horror films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1 & 2, Last House on the Left, and the original Hellraiser.</p></body></html>

He also designed the checks that are circulated in the country on a daily basis.<br /><br />Catch Me is directed by Steven Speilberg (E.T. Extra Terrestrial) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Aviator), Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump), Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter), and Martin Sheen (Wall Street).<br /><br />The film follows Frank, played convincingly by DiCaprio, through his younger years when his parents divorce, and his father Frank Sr., played brilliantly by Walken, slides down the social ladder and how this all leads young Frank into a life as a fraudulant and smooth con artist. He becomes a co-pilot with PAN-AM airlines, a doctor in charge of the entire midnight shift, and a lawyer. Frank's mission is to take back all the money that his dad lost from the US government, and its the no-joke FBI agent Hanratty, played by Hanks in one of his best roles, whose hot on his tracks and always one step behind him.<br /><br />The movie is one of the most entertaining and funniest films I have seen in a while. Speilberg lets his movie flow smoothly and gives his actors enough freedom to let their sense of humor shine through.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Christmas and halloween masterpiece!"></head><body><p>In the world of Halloween in a special town called HalloweenTown, the Pumpkin king named Jack Skeleton (Voiced by Chris Sarandon and sung by Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old thing year after year. He feels bored as one day he discovers a tree with a door into the world of Christmas as it brightens him up and gives him great ideas to something new and different for once. He decides to give the idea of Christmas to his world and wants to spread joy to many boys and girls with Santa Claus being replaced by him. Unfortunately when Jack thinks he's going good playing Santa to the real world's boys and girls he spreads terror by accident but has to find a way to fix it including saving Santa's life.<br /><br />Co-starring the voices of William Hickey and Catherine O'Hara, this is one of the greatest and most visually stunning animated epics yet. Based on a book and story by Tim Burton, this unique and imaginative animated feature became one of 1993's most critically acclaimed and popular hits that still remains popular to this day. Sure it has spawned merchandise and stuff but this is one of Tim Burton's best movies even though he didn't direct it but produced it and the songs are memorable as hell like "What's this?" and "This is Halloween". It's an exciting, dark and funny flick with an original concept and surely one movie that the entire family will enjoy but it's too scary for younger audiences, the animation is brilliant stop-motion and the voice acting is terrific.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray contains brilliant sound and picture that is pitch perfect! the extras are phenomenal such as Trailers, audio commentary, Haunted Mansion/Nightmare Before Christmas tour with on or off triva track, "Frankenweenie" uncut version with introduction by Tim Burton, Behind The Scenes making of "Nightmare Before Christmas" documentary, "Vincient" original short film by Tim Burton, Deleted Scenes, Story-to-film comparision, Blu-Ray exclusive Tim Burton introduction, Original Poem story that inspired the film narrated by Christopher Lee, three featurettes and poster gallery.</p></body></html>

Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks are wonderful in this enchanting story of a young man's dream life. Christopher Walken stars in one of his best roles next to his roles in; Pulp Fiction, The Deer Hunter. That's all I'm going to say about this great comical caper...watch it for a great time!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="...or should that be "A Beautiful Mind"?"></head><body><p>Like "A Beautiful Mind", "Proof" attempts to create drama out of mathematicians who are losing their minds.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as a "nice-guy" grad student digging through the notes of a recently dead mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) looking for any mathematical nuggets - the so-called "proofs". Gwyneth Paltrow playing the mathematician's fragile daughter, struggles with a character whose motivations and actions are simply not credible.<br /><br />"Proof" betrays its stage origins in its overwrought speechifying and artifice. The revelation in the third act is not that big-a-deal and the denouement is abrupt. "Proof" has high-minded pretensions but is ultimately unsatisfying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A refreshing Spielberg film"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg's latest film, Catch Me if You Can, is his freshest in years after a stretch of good but flawed movies. This lighthearted comedy/drama is a little different style of film then his usual sci-fi or heavy drama fare, and the change seems to have revitalized him.<p>This true story, which sticks pretty close to fact, follows Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DeCaprio) in the 1960s as he fakes his way as an airline pilot, doctor and a lawyer while cashing thousands of forged checks. The story is hard to believe, despite its basis in fact, but Spielberg brings it very much down to earth and creates some very real characters. It is a very simple film in its nature, compared to most of Spielberg more complicated tastes, as of late. In fact, it hearkens back to his early films which displayed a more youthful vigor and passion. What he has always been best at is telling simple, magical tales about regular people getting caught up in extraordinary events, and that's what Catch Me if You Can is all about.<p>In fact, this film seems to revitalize everyone involved. Not only is Spielberg at his highest form, DeCaprio performs far better then anything he's ever done before. He shows some true talent portraying the genius kid. He manages to upstage the great Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, something I never would have guessed was possible. Spielberg must have seen the potential in him, and helped bring it to the forefront. Also, John Williams score is breathtakingly original. As of late, the great composer has delivered some stale music that sounds much like many other scores he's done (something that happens to everyone after being in the business as long as he), but Williams here shows that he's still got the talent to produce amazing new material. The authentic 60's sound of the music captures the tone of the film perfectly, and the unique opening sequence both looks and sounds like a period production. There are a few moments where the score begins to sound like some of his other work, but Williams seems to keep it under control and these moments are only fleeting.<p>This film is truly as near flawless as they come. Sure it isn't something that will have a profound effect on anyone; it won't change culture or demand viewing upon viewing. It's not that kind of film. It's just a simple, fun, entertaining story that is expertly produced and shows that Spielberg still has what it makes to make the classic movies of his career. Good job Spielberg, I knew you still had it in you.</p></body></html>

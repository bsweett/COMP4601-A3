I found myself not especially liking or having a reason to like any of the characters in the movie. They seemed all so shallow and self-centered.  The movie jumps back and forth so much it seems like the people who made the movie may have been on drugs of some kind.  Creative idea for a movie, but what does the magic in the movie have to do with Chaos Theory?  This should be more thoroughly explained, right??<p>Kutcher is a great &quot;bad boy&quot; actor..that is about the only talent in the film.</p></body></html>

Elements of that style are in evidence in the unretouched look of "Source Code", which, in spite of its contemporary setting, shares some of the same themes. Capt. Colter Stephens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a Chicago-bound commuter train not knowing where he is or how he got there. The last thing he remembers was being a helicopter pilot with the 17th Airborne in Afghanistan. Now he sits opposite a woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who calls him Sean and seems friendly. Colter's reflection in the mirror is unfamiliar to him, and, before he can figure it out, the train explodes in a fiery ball.<br /><br />Now Colter is strapped into a capsule as a woman speaks to him through a monitor screen about an operation called Beleaguered Castle. She tries to help him regain cogent thought processes. Her name is Capt. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), and she explains that the train he was just on exploded this morning, killing those aboard. Colter's mission is to go back and find the bomber, so a second terrorist attack can be prevented. He has 8 minutes. He's not traveling back in time, but into the residual memories of a man who was killed on the train. And so Colter goes back to the train, Christina, the explosion, the capsule, Capt. Goodwin. Again and again, as he hunts for the bomber, an understanding of himself, and of the implications of the technology that enables him.<br /><br />It reminded me of "Moon" in its identity crisis and artificial reality, constructed for the benefit, or imprisonment, of the protagonist. This has a slicker, action-movie tone, though, rather than the contemplative pace of 1970s sci-fi. There is romance, action, and existentialism. And "Source Code", the mind-bending fusion of quantum mechanics and neurobiology that sends Colter into a dead man's memories, is billed as "a powerful weapon in the War on Terror." I felt the ending was a bit of a cop-out, and I'm not sure that it makes sense. But Colter's existential adventure does make sense, and there is enough action to keep the audience engaged even though, like our protagonist, we keep ending up back on the same train. Duncan Jones is now two-for-two and a promising talent.<br /><br />The DVD (Summit Entertainment 2011): There are 2 featurettes, an optional Trivia Track that you can run during the film, and an audio commentary. "Cast and Crew Insights" (35 min) interviews cast and director about themes, characters, and each other, in 11 parts. Some nice comments, but it is repetitive and too long. "Focal Points" (7 min) presents the technical ideas used in the film in 5 parts: memory recall, military virtual reality simulations, quantum physics, many worlds theory, and brain computer interface. The audio commentary is by director Duncan Jones, actor Jake Gyllenhaal, and writer Ben Ripley. They compare the film to earlier drafts, discuss technical details and directorial decisions, filming, and Gyllenhaal shares his experiences. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kill Bill vol. 2"></head><body><p>A comment crucial to understanding this film is made by David Carradine in the 'making of' documentary included with this DVD: 'Tarantino's movies have never been about the violence or action; they are about the minds and hearts of violent people.'<br /><br />In Volume 2, the focus on character and motivation is stronger than ever, and the Bride's final showdown with Bill - more conversation than combat - is as engaging a scene, emotionally, as the movie's other setpiece, her battle with Elle, is engaging viscerally.<br /><br />But those who say that Volume Two is 'better' than Volume One because of its slower pace and exposition fail to appreciate the entire film. Volume Two is a counterpoint to - and a fulfilment of - ideas created in Voume One.<br /><br />What may be the best evidence of Kill Bill's artistic value is that the Bride's five opponents do not just differ in their strength and combat gimmicks, allowing for more and more elaborate fight scenes; but in their motivations, their attitude toward violence, toward their own happiness and, ultimately, toward their own deaths. Each of them represents a philosophy. Vernita Green is the repentant killer; O-Ren is the megalomaniacal, Caligula-esque nihilist; Budd is a fatalistic, quiet nihilist; Elle is ambitious, cruel and spiteful. Bill is the ultimate philosophy of violence, violence for the sake of violence. The Bride was offered an escape from this world in the form of her child, which she lost, plunging her back into the cycle of death; but of course, as we know at the end of Volume One, her child is still alive.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the DVD, which is fairly sparse on features. Am I the only one who sees a 'special two-disc deluxe edition' coming out in the next few years?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best crime dramas in recent memory"></head><body><p>Sometimes what happens with a film is that one thing tends to define it without acknowledgeing the rest of it. Many people remember Usual Suspects but most of them will usually just go "yeah that ending rocked!" without saying anything about the rest of them movie. Well before the X-Men and upcoming Superman, Bryan Singer made this film, a film that is better than that one little scene at the end by itself.<br /><br />Verbal Kint is telling a story about how a boat got attacked and near 30 people were dead. In his story we meet 5 criminals who are called in about a robbery. There in lock up they meet, and decide to team up and take on some jobs. Verbal, McManus, Finster, Keaton and Hockney do some small jobs until a lawyer comes up to them and mentions a difficult job and the one wanting it done is Keyzer Soze, a legendary killer if there ever was one. So the question is who is it and does he even exist.<br /><br />Usual Suspects was one of those kind of slow burner films where it didn't make much money but it did garner 2 Oscars, one for Kevin Spacey and one for Screenplay. Then the greatness kicked in where everyone saw how good it was and it became one of the 90's best films. Most of that was probably due to word of mouth about the twist ending which is as shocking as it is familiar so it's actually been parodied a number of times, including Scary Movie and even Dr Doolittle.<br /><br />What makes the film work is not only the direction, score and the acting but it's a very sharply written story. Extra attention needs to be paid and in many scenes required repeated viewing to make sense of it. While the ending to some might cheapen the film, it works given the context. It's also very fascinating to watch the film; even though the film might have a leisurely pace, it never gets boring or makes you getting antsy.<br /><br />Currently #16 on IMDB's list, it's one of those films where people will outright hate it because they didn't get it or praise it for its complex narrative. I'm the latter and it's a film that definately deserves a buy.</p></body></html>

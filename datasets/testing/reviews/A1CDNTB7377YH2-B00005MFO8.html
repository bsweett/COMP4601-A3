<meta name="summary" content="Poor Beginning but a good story nonetheless"></head><body><p>Once you get past the preposturous and serious flawed opening of the movie, you have a great story  (in the first film we saw the damaged ship sink in the water.  This film supposes that Cornelious and Zira somehow retrieved the ship and repaired it and were able to fly it back through time.  All this was done in the short time from when Brent left their camp in the second film till he reached the mutant camp, which at most was a day).  This was probably the best acting for Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter in the series.  The movie makes us question the scientific use of animals in research.</p></body></html>

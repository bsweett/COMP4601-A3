<meta name="summary" content="Creepy Uncle Sy"></head><body><p>Mork, how you have changed!  From inane slapstick to skin-crawling revulsion, I gotta hand it to you, Mork:  you're showing some range in your golden years.  And ONE HOUR PHOTO successfully pegs the &quot;Goose Bumps&quot; meter, similar to finding a worm in your cupcake or going to church not knowing your fly is unzipped.  Shudder.<p>Photo developer Sy Parrish (Mork, er, Robin Williams) is the quintessential human ticking time bomb.  Lonely, depressed, insecure, he has no life other than his job at SavMart and his obsession with a yuppie family--an obsession that literally covers a wall of his shabby apartment with photographs of the handsome couple and their young son.  Sy wishes--initially--no harm on the family; he merely longs to be a part of their lives, to be embraced as &quot;Uncle Sy.&quot;  But his obsession, alas, cannot translate into reality, and when Sy suffers a career setback and then discovers a flaw in his beloved family, the mental choo-choo derails in a hurry.  The ending is atypical of psycho thrillers, and pushes Williams' disturbed character even more into the forefront.<p>The scrumptious Connie Nielsen is dynamite as Nina Yorkin, the unsuspecting victim of Sy's dysfunctional stalking; director Mark Romanek moves the story along with all the eery discomfort of scraping fingernails across a blackboard.  ONE HOUR PHOTO is a bona fide seat-squirmer, a scratch 'n sniff gag fest.  Mork, you've impressed me with your creepiness, but can you have this film developed by 5:00?<br />--D.

<meta name="summary" content="True Lies meets War of the Roses meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"></head><body><p>This movie seemed like "True Lies' meets "War of the Roses" meets "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid".  I liked it and enjoyed the way it had fun with the whole ridiculous premise.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hit the perfect balance of playing it straight, but not seriously.  It is an action comedy and a pretty darn good one.  Vince Vaughn adds a nice off beat touch to the whole thing.  Comparing his friendship with John Smith and Jane Smith's team, well, we can see clearly the difference not only in style but in personality.<br /><br />Look, it is hard to take professional killers seriously as people and especially ridiculous that such self-involved cold-hearted professionals appoach marriage as "what's it got for me" and wonder why their "relationship" has problems.  However, it does offer a kind of light commentary on 21st century dual professional marriages, doesn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, my advice is to enjoy the movie as fun and not make more of it than it is.  It is kind of a fun story with some just right performances.</p></body></html>

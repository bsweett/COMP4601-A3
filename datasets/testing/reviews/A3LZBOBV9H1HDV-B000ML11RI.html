The all-star cast headlined by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, and Jessica Alba, are impressive. The directing by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino is brilliant. The visuals are astounding and brilliant. The music by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell, is impressive. This is a film that is different and unique from all other movies. It has a sight "Pulp Fiction" feel to it. This is one of the best pictures of the year!</p></body></html>

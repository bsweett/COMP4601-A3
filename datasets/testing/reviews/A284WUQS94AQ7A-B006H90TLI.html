<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>This last Academy Award winning movie for best picture is simply that---the best picture!  I was mesmerized, scared and blown away!  Totally impressed!  On the edge of my seat and my eyes never left the screen the entire 122 minutes!  The Coen brothers did it again!  And I thought Fargo was good!<br /><br />My best buddy and Amazon friend, CLINT BRONSON, told me I had to see it it, because it was my type of movie, boy, he really knows me inside and out!<br /><br />Briefly, the movie begins where Lewellyn (Josh Brolin) goes hunting and comes across a bunch of dead bodies---humans & dogs both.  He investigates and finds a briefcase full of money.  He takes it, sends his wife to her crazy mother, and tries to take care of himself.  But Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one ultimate, psychopathic killer, is the owner of the briefcase and has put a transponder in it. NOTHING will stop him from getting his possession back.  Tommy Lee Jones is the local Texas sheriff and Woody Harrelson is the bounty hunter.  This is one hell of a journey and back and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />I liken this film to Silence of the Lambs---one exciting movie---FLAWLESS!  Buy it and enjoy!  The sound on a 5.1 surround system was so intense my dogs were barking from a distant room in the house---they were convinced it was real, and they don't do that often.<br /><br />THANK YOU CLINT, for more-or-less forcing me to buy this---it is definitely one of the best!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't blink or you'll miss something."></head><body><p>I can just imagine the production crew meeting at Universal Studios before VAN HELSING was launched:<p>"Let's make a 130-minute horror/adventure film and make sure every frame is filled with either blood, fangs, snarls, or CGI."<p>Mission accomplished.  VAN HELSING, based on a character plucked from Braum Stoker's "Dracula," is a visual onslaught of Transylvanian proportions that never--ever--lets up.  The movie looks good, especially with its opening black and white sequence depicting Frankenstein's castle under siege by enraged peasants, and certainly delivers enough thrills and chills to satisfy any ghoul lover.  Yet, after awhile, all the chaos and mayhem become as long in the tooth as the fangs on the vampires.<p>The story itself is surprisingly lame: Count Dracula must use Frankenstein's monster as a conduit to bring to life legions of<br />little vampire/bat offspring to wage war on mankind; the evil Count also uses werewolves to wipe out the last generation of a rival family; Van Helsing is dispatched by a secret Vatican society to clean up the mess.  With vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and even a brief dose of Jekyll and Hyde, this movie has as much on its plate as a five-gallon tub at a buffet.  Pardon the pun, but VAN HELSING bites off more than it can chew.<p>Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing is your typical one-dimensional, unemotional superhero.  David Wenham is the film's comic relief, although I liked him much better as Faramir in "The Lord of the Rings."  Richard Roxburgh as the scheming, diabolical Dracula reminded me of Bela Lugosi with a ponytail.  And femme fatale Kate Beckinsale can tap me on the shoulder to tango any time she wants.<p>Don't get me wrong:  I was entertained by this movie.  I particularly liked how the vampires would dislocate their jaws to depict sprouting fangs like mushrooms sticking out of a pile of manure.  But like a third helping of Haagen-Dazs, VAN HELSING is just too much.  It's a roller coaster ride that's fun, but lasts too long.  Three and one-half stars.<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

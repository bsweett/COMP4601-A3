<meta name="summary" content="Not The Original Storyline, but a better telling than "Incredible Hulk""></head><body><p>I saw this movie in the theaters, and just purchased it on HD prior to buying my copy of Incredible Hulk on Blu Ray.  I wish they had made this one the beginning of the tie in to the Avengers Series, because this movie had better actors, and a better storyline.  This movie has Bruce Banner played by Eric Bana, and Betty played by Jennifer Connelly.  Both are way better at there roles than Ed Norton and Liv Tyler.  The story flows around how 2 true scientist try to keep the power of the Hulk from falling into military hands.  Banner accidently gets the power unlocked in a lab accident protecting a fellow scientist.  The power was given to him by his father David (played by Nick Nolte), who shows back up to create problems for all.  On top of this, Betty's dad "The General" (played by Sam Elliot) is trying to get Banner.<br />The Hulk here I feel is better animated, more like the comic books I grew up on, the screenshots are cool with the multiple box approach, and the casting/acting are way better than "Incredible Hulk" . The chemistry was just better between these actors than the new movie.  Worth buying and watching many times.</p></body></html>

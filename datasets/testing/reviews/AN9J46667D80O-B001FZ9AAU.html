<meta name="summary" content="Robert Downey Jr IS Iron Man!"></head><body><p>I haven't read any of the comic books of Iron Man, so I came into this as something of a blank slate. I knew, from reading other Marvel comics back in the day, who he was and a little of his origins. I also knew he was an alcoholic, so I couldn't help but snicker when I found out Robert Downey Jr was picked to play Tony Stark. "How perfect," I thought. "Bound not to be much of a stretch for him."<br /><br />Thankfully, he turned out to be far, far better in the role than I had expected! He really owns every single seen he's in, and brings a real sense of confidence and ease to the picture.<br /><br />You know the plot by now: Tony Stark, billionaire weapons designer, is captured by terrorists while on a visit to a place suspiciously similar to Afghanistan. They try to force him to build a new weapon for them, and instead he builds it for himself, emerging in a suit of armor and becoming Iron Man.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, but it works very well. The film succeeds on several levels due largely to the good writing, excellent pacing and wonderful action. But what really brings it home is the great acting on the part of Downey, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow. They make this film what it is.<br /><br />There's really not much else to say here. It's an entertaining, well-done popcorn flick. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a stunning example of what the genre can do and easily the second best super hero film of 2008.</p></body></html>

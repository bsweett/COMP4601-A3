Their inspiration was an amusement park ride after all. The films seem to be more of a vehicle for Johnny Depp to step inside of a character he has a little too much fun playing and are aimed toward women (and men, in some cases) who like to oggle him more than anything. The sequels just felt like an already thin premise was stretched beyond its means, which resulted in lackluster sequels that came off as being too similar to the original film. They were still entertaining on some level and people really seem to love the franchise. But you can't expect a new sequel to come along and break the mold, especially when the previous films have made over $2.5 billion at the worldwide box office. On Stranger Tides pretty much offers more of the same for its fans.<br /><br />The Pirates films have never shied away from action, but On Stranger Tides seems to have even more than the films before it. It's Jack Sparrow's first film away from Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, so some over the top antics can probably be expected. Most of the film felt like an episode of "The Dukes of Hazzard" except it was centered around Jack Sparrow instead of the Duke boys and revolved around the open sea and The Black Pearl instead of Hazzard county and General Lee. Most of the scenes could basically be described in that voice over that'd say something along the lines of, "Jack's sure gotten himself into one heck of a pickle this time. How in the world will he swashbuckle his way out of this one?"<br /><br />With Jack worming his way out of several crazy situations and nearly non-stop swordplay and action, the film's cast could probably be considered better than decent. Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally are the only returning cast members from the previous films other than Depp and they slide back into the Barbossa and Gibbs characters just as easily as Depp channels Jack Sparrow. Angelica, played by Penelope Cruz, was a little too convenient of a character. A former love interest of Jack's who hasn't forgiven or forgotten the way things ended between them. Their relationship and the way things pan out between them just seemed rather predictable in the long run. Ian McShane was pretty disappointing, as well. He's given this incredibly cool character in Blackbeard. All pirates fear him; he has this awesome pirate ship, and can bring men back from the dead. He even has a few memorable one liners, but the guy couldn't have looked more bored during the entire film. Johnny Depp looks to be the only guy actually having fun in this film while everyone else just sees it as another job. On Stranger Tides still has an entertaining vibe to it, but also feels like a film we've seen three times before.<br /><br />Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is familiar territory. By now you should have a good idea of whether or not you'll enjoy the film or not. It follows the same formula as the previous three films, but is the shortest of the films and seems to be lacking a story that really reels you in. Audiences love Johnny Depp, so there's no doubt it'll be a success. The action does seem to be amped up a bit, but Jack Sparrow seems goofier than ever. It's humorous at times, but similar to Homer getting dumber in every new season of "The Simpsons." While the film wasn't a huge home run with critics, it's still the explosive and extravagant return of a character everyone loves and is bound to set the box office on fire once again.</p></body></html>

By that, I mean uncomplicated fun for those who from time to time enjoy watching a fast paced film that has elements of fantasy in it, and that lacks food for thought but makes up for that with lots of entertainment value.<br /><br />Are you, like me, one of those people I mentioned above? If the answer is no, do not lose your time, this film is probably not the right one for you. If the answer is yes, I recommend you watch this movie, but only after having enjoyed the first one.<br /><br />Now I am going to talk a little about the plot of "Underworld: evolution", so if you still have to watch the first movie in the series stop reading now, in order to avoid spoilers. The plot of this sequels picks up where the last one left off, and does an excellent job of allowing us to catch up with Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire death-dealer, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the young lycan she has feelings for. Michael was turned by Selene into a hybrid of lycan and vampire in order to be saved from certain death, but that act of defiance and the fact that Selene killed an ancient vampire ruler to protect Michael, means that they are both on the run.<br /><br />But what exactly has Michael turned into, and will they be able to survive? And what will happen when Marcus (Tony Curran), another of the vampire elders, turns into a hybrid of a different kind, and finally achieves the power to free his dangerous brother, William (Brian Steele)? Things become even more complicated when we find out that Marcus was the father of all vampires, as William was the father of all lycans. On top of everything, Marcus and William s father, Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), decides to meddle and help Selene and Michael to stop his sons. The alternative is chaos, and a world full of crazed lycans running free and wreaking havoc.<br /><br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind. The result is that their story is more believable, and thus more engaging.<br /><br />All in all, I can say that I really enjoyed watching this film, and that I believe that is even better than the first one. Of course, "Underworld: evolution" is not perfect, but it is so entertaining that does t matter too much. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: To Len Wiseman,please hurry up and make another sequel, I want to know what happens next to Selene and Michael :)<br />PS2: To parents, this movie has quite a lot of violence and a nude scene, so it is not adequate for children.</p></body></html>

Very very bloody.<br />*Very stylish filming style.  Even though the camera shakes around a lot, it manages to keep good focus on the action.  The photography ultimately serves well to capture the gritty realness of combat from Rambo's point of view.<br />*Despite being moody and silent, Stallone remains true to his character and is believable.<br />*This film is probably one of the most violent movies I know of, both graphically and brutally.  Much of this is focused on the injustices of the Burma regime, as they raid their own villages and brutally slaughter innocent civilians.  The film's main intention is to expose these attrocities, and I believe is it very effective and invoking (and thus successful).<br />*Very strong theme about the need for heroes or war fighters in society.<br />*Pretty good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not for the squeamish.<br />*Some of the dialogue is simplistic or dull (especially when the missionaries are trying to convince Rambo to go upriver; their arguments weren't very convincing, so it's kind of weird that Rambo agreed).<br />*The plot is ultimately very thin and simplistic (but this could also be a good thing, because its mercifully short).<br /><br />As a Rambo action movie, this one probably doesn't work as well.  But as a video-essay concerning the situation in Burma and the need for heroes in this world, it is quite excellent.  It's not "Schindler's List" by any means, but like "Children of Men" or "Lord of War," it definately highlights the worst, most brutal aspects of human violence and war.  You're probably not supposed to enjoy watching Rambo tear all of the bad guys apart, but after seeing what the bad guys do, you wind up rooting for him anyway.  Ultimately, the movie exposes the attrocities of a regime that would have otherwise gone unnoticed by the general public (I know I would have never known).  It's very rough and brutal, but if you can take it, it's certainly worthwhile watching.</p></body></html>

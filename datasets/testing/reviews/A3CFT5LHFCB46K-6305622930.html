<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest war biographies ever filmed"></head><body><p>George C. Scott gives the finest performance of his career has the fabled World War 2 general. The movie follows Patton's career from the North Africa Campaign to the end of the war. Jerry Goldsmith's excellent soundtrack really makes the film what it is. The film is also humorous. Patton always has to be criticized for something (Slapping a soldier, criticizing the Russians, e.t.c). Patton believes in reincarnation; thinking that he was a soldier in past lives. In one scene, where Patton and Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) are at an ancient Greek battlefield, when Patton describes the battle he says, "I was there".  <p>This is definitely one war movie (or any kind of movie) I would not mind watching over and over again.</p></body></html>

There's also a particularly nifty and surprising twist to the story that most viewers won't see coming.<br /><br />Director Iain Softley sets the story in the swamps of Louisiana and instills the proceedings with a distinctive roux of race and religion that permeates New Orleans and its outlying parishes. Consequently, the Skeleton Key has a swampy, soulful authenticity, and some surprisingly good performances, placing it a notch above some of the mediocrities of the same genre.<br /><br />With its ghosts, dusty, rubbish filled attics, attractive young woman in jeopardy and near-constant rainstorms, this movie is as psychologically spooky and atmospheric as a ghost story could possibly be. Combined with its evocative setting, and a coolly restrained leading performance from Kate Hudson and a truly wonderfully over-the-top supporting turn from Gena Rowlands, The Skeleton Key is quite hip, slick, and suspenseful.<br /><br />Hudson plays Caroline, a young hospice worker and aspiring nurse, recently moved to Louisiana, who is hired by Violet Devereaux (Gena Rowlands), a cantankerous woman to take care of Ben (John Hurt), her paralyzed husband in their rundown mansion in some backwater parish of the bayou. Ben has suffered a debilitating stroke after a visit to the house's attic, now his speechless and spends his days staring out at the picturesque garden from his wheelchair; he's also terrified of looking in mirrors.<br /><br />Violet makes a great ceremony of explaining that she had keys made to all the rooms of the house, which sags with a shabby elegance and lots of religious iconography on the lip of a moss-draped bayou; she gives Caroline the skeleton key, which opens every door, including the one to the attic.<br /><br />Of course, Caroline has no need to ever go up into the attic, but she's a bit of a nosey parker, so her inquisitiveness eventually gets the better of her. Once there, she begins to explore a mysterious secret room beyond a locked door, where once long ago strange and furtive happenings took place.<br /><br />To reveal any more of the plot, would spoil the story, but suffice to say, Caroline gets herself involved in all sorts of supernatural and ghostly shenanigans. She gradually discovers that nothing is as it first seemed, the old man Ben, is being held prisoner against his will, the house is possessed by voodoo spirits, and she herself may even be trapped by their evil spell.<br /><br />The film works, not just because of the gorgeous Ms. Hudson, who manages to imbue Carolyn with a no-nonsense brusqueness and a fearless bullheadedness, but also because Softley manages to instill the proceedings with a Southern Gothic ambience; he also makes the most of Hudson's loaded dialogue exchanges and creepy encounters with Rowlands.<br /><br />Indeed, Rowlands delivers a quietly hilarious performance as the gruff, chain-smoking doyenne of the bayou, who quietly resents the fact that Caroline does not speak with a Southern accent. Peter Sarsgaard is also chillingly notable as Violet's handsome, but also quite enigmatic young real estate lawyer.<br /><br />Skeleton Key is one of those films that you shouldn't think too much about after you've finished watching it; otherwise you'll probably find that much of the story's logic will come crashing down around you. But the appeal of The Skeleton Key lies not in its plot but in its attention to detail, and the way Softley luxuriates in the deeply textured sights and sounds of Louisiana.<br /><br />The director is obviously having fun soaking up all spooky clich&eacute;'s: an old blind lady with a milky stare, a handsome stranger who asks Caroline if she can speak French, pickled body parts, faded photographs of unhappy people in period dress, a stuffed dummy in a blond wig, and a magical circle in chalk and blood.

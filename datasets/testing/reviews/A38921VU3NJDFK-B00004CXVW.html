<meta name="summary" content="Dark City (1998)"></head><body><p>Of no relation to or influence from the 1950 or 1990 films of the same title, this stylish, atmospheric, and very creepy sci-fi noir features a great cast, striking, dreamlike visuals, and plays out like a nihilistic nightmare. Directed and co-produced by Alex Proyas (The Crow; I, Robot), whose original story he adapted into a screenplay with David S. Goyer (Batman Begins) and Lem Dobbs, Dark City follows John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), a man who wakes up in a dark hotel bathroom with no recollection of how or when he got there. Before long, he's the lead suspect in a murder investigation led by detective Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) and he's being contacted by a mysterious psychiatrist named Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland). To make matters worse, as he searches for his wife (Jennifer Connelly), he also must evade a strange group of creatures called "The Strangers," who have perpetrated eternal darkness on the film's city and have the ability to change its landscapes and put its inhabitants to "sleep" at will. Proyas' vision is a terrifying one that exhibits similarities to other sci-fi works such as The City of Lost Children (which would have made the list had the list been longer), and served as a mild influence for The Matrix trilogy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spike Lee's Straight Story"></head><body><p>After "Clockers" I gave up on Spike Lee.  Even though he is a talented moralist, boring and rote is still boring and rote.  So it was with some trepidation that I picked up "Inside Man."  Could he keep his predilections under wraps for once, the way Lynch did with "Straight Story"?  The answer is mostly yes.*  It's a great detective-drama-action movie, a whodunit with good characters and articulate plot twists.  Even people like me who have grown skeptical of Spike Lee's abilities would be pleased with the movie.<br /><br />*  He still couldn't resist totally gratuitous references to violent video games, white cop bigotry and proper gun safety.</p></body></html>

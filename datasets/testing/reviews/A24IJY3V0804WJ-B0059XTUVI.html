<meta name="summary" content="Streep brings Thatcher to life"></head><body><p>One of the finest actress ( Streep)of our times brings life to one of the most remarkable figures of the 20th century. Whether or not you embrace conservatism, you have to agree that Margaret Thatcher was not just a important political figure but an extremely important one.<br />Told in a series of flashbacks, and through many imaginary conversations that Thatcher keeps on having with her husband, Dennis Thatcher or DT, this film is filmed after her tenure as the British PM. It traces her roots- small grocer's family, her entry into politics and finally her act as the British PM. We simply get a glimpse of her rise but only superficially. The movie does not reveal her relations with her children or friends. I realize that such an endeavor is impossible in the hour and 45 minute run time. However, to get a fleeting glimpse on the British PM, this film is great. Nothing more was expected and the film delivered just that . Three stars. 7/15/2012</p></body></html>

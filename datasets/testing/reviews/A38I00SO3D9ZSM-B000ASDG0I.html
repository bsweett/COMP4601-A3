The Smiths are both suprisingly amusing, Mr. Smith particularly charming.  Mrs. Smith's an ass-kicker in the vain of Lara Croft.  The movie's pace is very quick and never lets the viewer get bored. It's worth the couple dollars it costs to rent it.<br /><br />Just don't watch this movie if you're hoping for anything original, creative or mentally stimulating.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a blow-em-up movie with a few witty one-liners, nothing more, nothing less.  If you just want to sit back and enjoy a good (over-the-top) car chase or gunfight, get it.  Not that it's the best action comedy flick out there, but it'll do.  McDonald's doesn't make the best hamburgers but sometimes they really hit the spot.<br /><br />[It's really a 2.5 star movie, but I've rounded up rather than down]</p></body></html>

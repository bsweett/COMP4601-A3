<meta name="summary" content="Story of rap star wannbe misses some beats"></head><body><p>I don't know quite what to make of "8 Mile". I am admittedly not much of a fan of rap music or of the movie's star, Eminem. This is not to say I haven't enjoyed some rap songs, some of which were written and performed by Marshall Mathers, AKA Eminem. <p>The movie was directed by one of my favorite directors, Curtis Hanson. To me, it does not stand up to his best works, "LA Confidential" and "Wonder Boys". Is this because those are stronger films or because the subject matter in "8 Mile" is less appealing to me? I'm not sure, but I do know this: "8 Mile" is relentlessly dark [literally and figuratively] and grim, whereas Hanson's previous efforts, though serious, were peppered with a great deal of satire and humor. What is ironic to me is that the director fails to see the satiric, humorous nature of much of rap music itself. <p>Jimmy [Eminem] grew up on the `wrong side' of Detroit's 8 Mile Road, which is a kind of boundary between the city's mostly black inner city and its predominately white suburbs. Jimmy is an angry young man who channels his frustrations into his rap music. The problem is that he's a `trailer trash white boy' [his own description of himself] trying to make it in a rap world dominated by black artists. Adding to his woes is the fact that, after packing all his things into a garbage bag and leaving his pregnant girlfriend, he is forced to live with his drunken mother [Kim Basinger] and her...boyfriend. The few bright spots in his life are his kid sister, his small group of loyal friends and his musical talent. Can Jimmy escape his fate through his music, or will he end up being just another [also-ran] in the long history of pop music?<p>Eminem is excellent as Jimmy, but whether this is because he is a fine actor or because he is playing a version of himself remains to be seen. There are certainly many parallels between his life and character he plays. <p>As a movie about pop music culture, this one is superior to most others. If only its outlook weren't so unrelentingly bleak!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Full Metal Kubrick". DVD"></head><body><p>When this film came out, many Viet Nam films were being made, at the time. So, this film, took a different spin, on the material. Viet Nam was merely the backdrop, for this film, which focuses more upon, a few of the characters. As they experience, basic training, and eventually, some action in Viet Nam. A well made psychological War film, done only the way Kubrick can.</p></body></html>

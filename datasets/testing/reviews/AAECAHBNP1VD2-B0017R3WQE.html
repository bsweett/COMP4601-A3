<meta name="summary" content="The best movie ever made? Don't think so."></head><body><p>While there's no doubt Pacino's Scarface is a semi-riveting and immensely watchable film (hey; you know about the extreme violence and language going in, so you really can't complain about that), it really hasn't aged all that well. Tony Montana is so swaggering, showy and larger-than-life a character, he manages to become a parody of himself within the confines of the film. Watching the movie today, Montana doesn't emerge as someone to emulate or admire, but someone to ultimately regard as pathetic. He lets pride, ego and money blind him to everything else in life, including rational thinking and common sense. (By contrast, many other drug-dealer films do include more of a personal-life level). In some ways, the whole movie has an almost cartoonish feel to it. Bottom line: this Scarface just hasn't withstood the test of time except as a cult flick. The 1932 version is simply timeless.</p></body></html>

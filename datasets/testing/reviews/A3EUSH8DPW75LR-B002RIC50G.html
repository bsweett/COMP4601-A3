<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Horror Film - Nothing More"></head><body><p>To begin a review of this film I think it is very important to acknowledge that it is is no way of the caliber of the Hannibal Lecter films with Anthony Hopkins and is in no way an intense psychological profile based horror film with deep characterizations.  It is in no way a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Luckily, I came into this knowing the book and movie both got bad reviews so I had no expectations.  And this allowed me to watch this film and enjoy it as a separate entity from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<br /><br />The idea of seeing how the young Hannibal developed his desires and tastes for cruelty and sadistic murder is very intriguing and the plot certainly is overblown.  His family lived in Lithuania during the war and he watched his parents get killed and when he and his sister were alone, he saw soldiers invade the house and eventually devour his sister - supposedly in order to survive for they had no food.  Of course if a person viewed all this they would be affected for life.<br /><br />I found Gaspard Ulliel, who plays Hannibal, to have a very strong screen presence and totally believed his madness and the purpose of avenging the death of his sister as a reason/excuse to begin his avenging those who were a part of her death.  What was difficult for me was that he did not speak until he finds his way to the home of his aunt and when he finally spoke it was very quietly and he had a very strong accent that had no hint whatsoever of how Hannibal spoke later in life as played by Anthony Hopkins.  The introduction of the aunt causes some confusion in the script.  She teaches him martial arts and how to use swords.  We do see how he possesses this ability but we don't see why she taught him this.<br /><br />The last half of the film was excellent but not as a prequel explaining the true story of Hannibal Lecter but as an excellent horror film.  Each murder he commits is gruesome and very well filmed.  It is a quality horror film.  I believed his intensity and developing madness and was able to appreciate this film for what it was.<br /><br />If you watch this film thinking you will see an intriguing intro ino the madness of Hannibal Lecter of the quality of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS you will be greatly disappointed.  But as a horror movie in its own right it is excellently made.  The acting is all around very good, the scares are there and the gore is plentiful and utilized in believable ways.  I ended up really enjoying this film for what it was.<br /><br />Watch this with no more expectations than seing a fun, quality horror film that happens to have Hannibal Lecter in it.  The reasons for his desire to kill are fully explained but in a simple way but why his madness kept on evolving and he took pleasure in being a true monster is left alone.  You believe he is a monster but it is meant to just be accepted.</p></body></html>

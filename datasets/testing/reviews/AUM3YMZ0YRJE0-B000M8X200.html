<meta name="summary" content="pioneer camp, but too slow and far too cartoonish"></head><body><p>I was very disappointed in this film experience.  The start is slowed down by way too many details about Krypton's governmental system - you get 25 minutes of Jor-el's debate with other literal luminaries in their silly aluminum-foil costumes - and then a bunch of scenes to define superman's character while a boy (most of these are part of the "director's cut" which while fun can also be a bore).  So the action doesn't begin until about an hour into the film, and my kids had long gotten bored by it and wandered out of the room (and I got it for them).  Even for me, a hard lover of sci-fi, it was boring - so I must warn watchers who are not committed, uncritical fans:  you will probably not enjoy this part.  It is just plain too slow, even static, which means this part is poorly edited.<br /><br />Once the action starts, the film becomes pretty good.  You see pre-computer age effects to show what it wd be like for a man to fly, etc., and you can always enjoy the difference.  While they are limited to pretty silly caricatures, there is no question that the actors are good, expecially the young Reeve in the role that made him a star.  Kidder is also good, in her stunningly beautiful prime, as is Hackman.<br /><br />But we are used to kid-adult films that have become much better than this, like Spiderman, Harry Potter or the Star Wars series.  They speak to both groups of watchers with richer characters, more complex and engaging plots, and slicker effects (that last is not necessarily an asset as you can always recognize computer-generated images).  As such, Superman looks like a prototype for far far better films of the genre.  Indeed, I was surprised at how disappointed I was by the film - and my kids voted with their feet.  I didn't even find the camp aspect funny enough to make me laugh.<br /><br />Tepidly recommended.</p></body></html>

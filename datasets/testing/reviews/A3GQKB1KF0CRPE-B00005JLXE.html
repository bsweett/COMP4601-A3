<meta name="summary" content="surprisingly fun movie"></head><body><p>I resisted Daredevil, because, frankly, there is such a glut of ?super hero? movies.  Not they are bad, but there are Xmen, Hulk, Spiderman?seems there is always another one, but nothing really that stands outs.  But I must say this movie surprised me.  With engaging performances by Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in the leads, nice support from bad guys Michael Clark Duncan and Colin Farrell and as the nose-for-news reporter Joe Pantoliano, plus super effects, it?s a fun movie.  There is a driving soundtrack that really sets the mood for the movie,<br /><br />music that will cause you to go out and buy the soundtrack.<br /><br />It?s a tight rope act to bringing a comic book story to the screen, too often a movie will take itself too serious, or it comes across as too cartoonish.  Davedevil manages that balance.  You have enough seriousness to keep you hooked, but it has that ?stretch the boundaries? feel to retain the comic book flavor.<br /><br />The store is the typical line.  The young idealistic kid witnesses his father playing muscle for the local hood.  Shock by the ?fall? of his hero, he runs away and ends up losing his sight to a chemical spill.  The kid fights back and takes the<br /><br />advantages his other senses now give him and won?t give into the tragedy.  The death of his father, later sending him down the road as the avenger for the downtrodden, the defender of justice.  Garner plays his love interest, but she is a pawn sacrificed by her fathers misdeed.  The romance between Affleck and Garner is solid, the chemistry very believable.  Great fight scenes.  All the mix to make this just a very enjoyable movie in this genre.</p></body></html>

I was pleasantly surprised that the producers of "Red Dragon" did the right thing and didn't attempt to take Manhunter on head-to-head, but instead to provide additional context to the Harris book.  Yes the ending was a cliche, but I think the writers' reasoning was that those who had already seen Manhunter needed to be surprised too.  I can respect that, and I think the ending was well done.<br /><br />Comparisons are inevitable, so here goes.  Brian Cox vs. Anthony Hopkins: very favorable, I think because the writers and producers had Sir Anthony on a much tighter leash than in Hannibal.  The role called for restraint and Hopkins delivers.  I particularly liked the first scene, where Graham realizes that Hannibal is a cannibalizing murderer.  Fans of the earlier movie may recall that Graham's realization is slightly different (in Manhunter, Graham glances at a book on war wounds, and realizes that Hannibal is the killer) but aesthetically the opening scene makes perfect logic in its own right.<br /><br />William Peterson vs. Edward Norton: both fine actors, with somewhat similar styles.  Mr. Norton is excellent in the role in the remake.  Mr. Peterson was more melodramatic (think: wiping hand on thigh while watching the Jacobi's home movie) but I believe that's more a function of writing as opposed to acting.<br /><br />Tom Noonon vs. Ralph Fiennes: both were excellent and believable in their roles as the psychopathic Francis Dollarhyde.  I suppose Noonon was a little bit higher octane, but that's again a function of writing as opposed to acting.<br /><br />Dennis Farina vs. Harvey Keital: I'm a *huge* fan of "Midnight Run" so I'm biased in favor of Dennis Farina.  I liked Dennis Farina better in the original.  He had a lot more energy than Mr. Keitel.<br /><br />Overall, the film is very enjoyable for both fans of Manhunter and those who have not seen the original.  I recommend it for all.  Like the Amazon.com review says, this film could have fallen into any of several pitfalls and it didn't.</p></body></html>

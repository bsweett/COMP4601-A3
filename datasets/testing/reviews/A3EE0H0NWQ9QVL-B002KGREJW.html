<meta name="summary" content="The Missing Love"></head><body><p>Just like 'The Squid and the Whale' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums' before it, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a quirky, comedy masterpiece about a dysfunctional family and their quests for love and greatness.  The father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who echoes Ricky Bobby's dad in 'Talledega Nights'.  ("If you're not a winner, then you're a loser.")  He is an angry and frustrated patriarch who has difficulty living up to his own advice.  He's overbearing even with his understanding, loving wife (Toni Collette of 'Sixth Sense' fame), and his family shows that not only success, but love is missing in the family equation.<br /><br />The grandfather (Adam Arkin) is a foul-mouthed heroin addict who, unlike his son, shoots straight from the hip.  His teenage son, Duane, is a goth silent type who only communicates with a notepad.  His brother, and their uncle, is gay and has just attempted suicide before living with the family, interestingly enough sharing Duane's bedroom where they can have heart-to-heart talks.  The daughter (Abigail Breslin) is sweet, perceptive, and charming.  She's an arm for the family ego, so she is a candidate for "Little Miss Sunshine,"  a nauseatingly glamorous child beauty contest taking place in California.<br /><br />Many mishaps come along the way as the whole family goes from Arizona to the Redondo Beach contest in an aging Volkswagon van.  The grandfather has a lot to say on the journey, including a shaking piece of wisdom for his granddaughter the night before the contest.  Having the pre-contest jitters, she hears her grandfather say, "A real loser is someone who is so afraid of losing, they're afraid to try."  The uncle also has much wisdom, including some advice to Duane about suffering that he seems to need and hear for himself in the same meeting.  With the admonition that our society has a low tolerance for failure, and the wit and laughter to set us all straight, 'Little Miss Sunshine' remains a sage and funny family satire.  (It is rated 'R,' so the laughs may be only for those family members at your discretion--mainly for a lot of profanity.)</p></body></html>

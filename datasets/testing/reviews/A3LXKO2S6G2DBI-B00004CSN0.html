<meta name="summary" content="Overrated but Entertaining Thriller"></head><body><p>At times plodding and overwrought--the line about "heat" itself is rather clumsy--"Heat" nonetheless is an entertaining cops and robbers thriller that benefits from the contrast between leads Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino.  These heavy hitters from the 1970s finally get to meet onscreen in a scene that is delightful for being so underplayed.  Director Michael Mann, whose magnificent retelling of "The Last of the Mohicans" set a new standard for action films, is in fine visual form here; his camerawork is crisp and confident, and he relies on his signature "slow burn" shots and music to carry much of the emotional punch.  With Sergio Leone and Peter Yates obvious influences--the ending of the film alone seems taken right out of "Bullitt"--Mann sometimes also dips into "Miami Vice" territory with the pacing of "Heat"; what works on TV, though, doesn't always work in film, and here there are a few too many "talking head" scenes that slow the film down.  The story is relatively simple:  a gang of bank robbers is tracked by an obsessed cop after turning the streets of downtown Los Angeles into a war zone.  Along the way, the film explores buddy and romantic relationships, culminating in a chase that is correctly the focal point of these entanglements.  Co-stars Val Kilmer, John Voight, and Amy Brenneman are capable, but it's pretty clear that DeNiro and Pacino are the stars.  The barebones DVD leaves a bit to be desired, though it fares better than the director's cut of "The Last of the Mohicans," which wasn't really an improvement over the theatrical version of the film.</p></body></html>

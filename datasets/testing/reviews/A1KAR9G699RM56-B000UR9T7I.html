Then we see Peter's and MJ's friend, Harry, once again try to assault Peter, only to lose his memory in the process, and make a return to old times.  Additionally, Peter's schoolwork is excellent, but he's got competition at the office from a young hotshot Eddie Brock Jr., whose all to eager to get a scoop.  Then, we have Thomas Haden Church's character or Flint Marko in the story, running from jail, while still trying to get money for his daughter's medical needs, only to find himself turned into the Sandman early on in the film.  Peter finds out from the police that actually Marko was the one to kill Ben, and soon enough, all of these stories intertwine.<br /><br />I introduce the film this way one, to be free of spoilers, and two, because in reality the greatest downfall of the film is the entanglement of all the stories together, into what appears to be a relatively coordinated mess.  Mind you I do still like the film, but in this one, I wanted to get my complaint out there early.<br /><br />Now for my praise, as I felt that even with all of the crossing of story-lines, I did feel a sympathetic ear for the characters, as was intended.  Especially since, more then ever with the introduction of the symbiote, Peter Parker/(the Black Spider) takes a dark turn, and starts ruining his life, among others.  Thus, we were allowed to learn about all the characters, even if there were so many different characters.<br /><br />Which actually brings me to another complaint, and that's the unnecessary emphasis of Peter Parker's cockiness.  For instance, there's at least a five-minute scene where Peter's just strutting on the street, and sure we get he's changed, but this is quite worthless a scene.<br /><br />All in all, while the movie ran a little long, and definitely earned some of its negativity, I personally enjoyed the film, and that's all I can say when the lights go up.</p></body></html>

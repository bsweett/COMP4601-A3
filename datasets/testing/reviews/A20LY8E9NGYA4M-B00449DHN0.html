<meta name="summary" content="TECHNICALLY PERFECT, HOWEVER, THE PLOT HAS HIGHS AND LOWS."></head><body><p>&quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; was a film with huge expectations when the movie hit the screen in december of 2002. The fans of the great director Martin Scorsese were eager to see his latest film in years. Well, finally &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; was in theaters and the movie got a lot of mixed reviews, and I think it's obvious why that happened. You make a movie with a long running time (almost 3 hours), with a plot based in a controversial book, you throw graphic violence and racism, and obviously you will offend a lot of people.<p>Those are the controversial elements in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot;, however the movie has a lot of things to talk about. This film has depth in almost every single technical aspect: the sets are beautiful and above all, they are very real. The costumes and makeup are very specific and believable. The music score was made by the always efficient Howard Shore. Most of the performances are excellent, specially Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill &quot;The Butcher&quot;, he created one of the scariest villains in recent years, also he got a lot of acting awards for this role. Liam Neeson is outstanding in a brief, but essential role, he plays Priest Vallon. John C. Reilly as Happy Jack and Jim Broadbent as William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed are also highlights in the cast.<p>Of course, there was a lot of controversy with the selection of Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role, some might find him too weak and some might find him outstanding, I think that he did a good job in this movie, but this is not one of his best performances. The acting talent of Cameron Diaz had little use in this movie. The direction of Martin Scorsese was very good, because he had a lot of elements and he made a complex movie, not a lot of directors can make a convincing work with such a complicated material.<p>Now, the plot does have highs and lows. The opening scene is one of the most impressive battles in recent years, overall all the battles in the film are excellent. But I think that the movie could have been edited more efficiently, there are a lot of scenes that doesn't add continuity to the plot. The movie lengths almost 3 hours, I think that 130 minutes could have been more effective, but at the end of the day there are more good things in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; than flaws.<p>The DVD features are very interesting (if you liked the movie, of course), the audio commentary by Martin Scorsese is the highlight of the DVD features. The documentaries are very detailed and informative, they offer a lot of different perspectives. The Five Points study guide and the multi-angle sets are just amazing, almost make you feel like you are in there, so if you liked &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; you are going to love the bonus disc.<p>&quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; may offend a lot of people because the movie tells a story about violence and obviously says that USA history is plagued with violence and racism since the beginning, but the movie also says that a lot of brave people fought to create the USA. So yes, the movie may be controversial but &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; has too many good things, so rent it first, if you like the movie, this DVD is a must-own. Specially recommendable to fans of Martin Scorsese.</p></body></html>

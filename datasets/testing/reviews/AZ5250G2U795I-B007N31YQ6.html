<meta name="summary" content="Julia Roberts CAN act!"></head><body><p>OK....I've always found Julia Roberts pleasant, but figured her acting range was probably somewhere in the same force as a Daisy Air Rifle (I DID see Mary Reilly, after all!).  I was amazed.  She fleshed out a seriously flawed character and gives her warmth, charm, and grit.<p>My one flaw with the movie is Erin's full-force bravado that comes with little reproach.  She manages to fire off some SERIOUSLY mean things, but yet is never really heald accountable for them.  Hard to suspend my disbelief when most real life situations calling for this would probably get you belted.<p>Overall, a seriously well acted film that horrifically depicts the corrupting power of a large corporation and it's ripple effect on a community and on lives.  But it also shows how much power one person really can have.</p></body></html>

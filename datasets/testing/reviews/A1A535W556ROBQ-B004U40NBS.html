Aranofsky has no knowledge of how the ballet, much less the creative process, functions.  What he tries to create is another visceral experience, filled more with "wet dreams" than any sense of dance or the stage.  Since Natalie is obviously not much of a dancer, we see this production almost entirely from behind her right shoulder.  Symbolic perhaps, but downright annoying when it comes to seeing any dance.  Of course this movie is not about dance, it is about poor Nina's painful metamorphosis, as she tries to shake the claustrophobic world of her mother (Barbara Hershey), who had forsaken dance to have her, and get past her own limitations of "perfection."<br /><br />Mila Kunis adds a little intrigue as Lily, but Aronofsky uses her as little more than a sexual foil to Nina's growing ambitions.  The ballet master might as well have been played by Piers Morgan, as he does little more than frown and genuflect when Nina fails to give him the "black swan" he so much desires.  He taunts her into masturbating, supposedly to unleash the sexual energy he is looking for in the role.  Portman spends most of the time looking lost and confused, not sure where Thomas (Seymour Kassel) is going to go next, until she finally gets her moment on stage and literally becomes the black swan.  Although I have to say I was impressed with Winona Ryder's portrayal of Beth.  Ryder is virtually unrecognizable, and gave the character more emotional energy than any of the other actors did their characters.  In the end this is little more than a children's story with some steamy scenes for adults, fading out exactly as had The Wrestler.</p></body></html>

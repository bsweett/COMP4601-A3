<meta name="summary" content="American Gangster, pursuing "The American Dream""></head><body><p>As a teenager, I was a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ULPFGI">Miami Vice: The Complete Series</a>, and I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a> so I bought this 2 disk Anniversary edition of Scarface.<br /><br />At the time I purchased this, I had been listening to many Gangsta Rap and Hip Hop CDs, and I've read that many musicians are inspired by this film.  The Special Features explore the music industry's fascination with this classic movie.<br /><br />This is literally a story of "rags to riches," and this is also a story of becoming power mad.  I was completely engaged and mesmerized by his rise to power, but it is sad to see that he let his power become paranoia and he hit his personal stash instead of being a business man.  He reminds me of Uncle Sam, right now.  Too much power, but not enough Self Control.<br /><br />America loves (and often votes for) its Gangsters, and this is a great tribute to the ideals of North America.  At the risk of being labled a "Turahist," I love this movie and so do most North Americans.  Sad ending, but a great film.</p></body></html>

A terrific cast and taut direction help to make this by turns frightening, depressing, humorous and outrageous.  The opening sequence, with the morning of first attacks and then the opening credits with the song "When the man comes around" by Johnny Cash, is one of the best things ever filmed.  In fact, the soundtrack is one of the strengths of the film.<br />And just to let you know:  zombies are much scarier when they run after you, as opposed to shuffling!</p></body></html>

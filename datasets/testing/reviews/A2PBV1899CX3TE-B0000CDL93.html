Jim Garrison and his attempt to find the truth about JFK's assassination, and if there was a conspiracy, to bring the conspirators to justice. Though he didn't get a conviction, he at least went farther than any other law enforcement entities. He brought a murder and conspiracy charge against one of the alleged participants. According to this movie, the jury believed there was a conspiracy, but they didn't feel his case met the burden of proof as far as the individual charged was concerned. Subsequently, it was revealed that he worked for the CIA.<br /><br />"JFK" is Oliver Stone's favorite Oliver Stone film. He considers it his 'Godfather.' "JFK" is also Oliver Stone's most controversial film, with some who share his high opinion, and others who consider it blasphemy, tantamount to treason. Walter Cronkite, who was at one time the most trusted man in America, thought it was rubbish. The head of at least one media empire suppressed a 34 word capsule review that was too favorable. The writer complained about it and was fired. I think they were killing the messenger because they didn't like the message.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Jim Garrison: Thank you for your time, David. I'm sorry this has to end inconveniently for you but I am going to have to detain you for further questioning by the FBI.<br />David Ferrie: Why, what's wrong?<br />Jim Garrison: David, I find your story simply not believable.<br />David Ferrie: Really? What part?<br />==========================================<br /><br />Likewise, some may find Oliver Stone's story simply not believable, but it is a lot more believable than the conclusions of the Warren Report.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Jim Garrison: Once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you'd have to conclude that there was a fourth shot and a second rifle. And if there was a second rifleman, then by definition, there had to be a conspiracy.<br />===========================<br /><br />The director of a film can manipulate the truth -- omit certain details, highlight others, cherry pick certain facts to support his thesis, or completely fabricate from beginning to end. Fiction, as a literary form has been called "lies that tell the truth" and when you are talking about film, you just might be more in the realm of lies that tell even bigger lies." But I think that JFK was researched and put together well, and it was much more than either mere entertainment or propaganda. It actually was very entertaining, but in a way that makes you think. Though the truth of what happened that day in November may be "a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma" -- obscured so much that we may never know the real truth, Oliver Stone has really done a masterful job. I think that just like Jim Garrison, Stone has shown that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, if he was in fact an assassin and not just a patsy. The sequence in the courtroom where Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, lays out his case that there was at least a second rifleman is a masterful sequence. Filmed in one long take, requiring prodigious memorization by Costner, it is the compelling highlight of  JFK. Once you get past the hurdle of the idea foisted on the American Public by the Warren Commission that JFK was killed by a lone assassin, then all kinds of questions open up. It really gets you thinking.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />X: Fundamentally, people are suckers for the truth. And the truth is on your side, Bubba.<br />===========================<br /><br />Most people who were alive when JFK was killed remember where they were that day. It seems that when JFK died, our innocence died also. Jello Biafra of the punk band, The Dead Kennedys says that the name of his group was thought up by some hippies, Grateful Dead Heads who threw it out as a possibility in a long list of possible names. He grasped the significance of that name, as it expressed the death of our innocence. Jerry Seinfeld, trying to deal with the fundamental contradiction -- the rift in our society, used humor. In a parody of "the single bullet theory" called, "the single lugie theory" a baseball player is spat on in an incident after a game. Wayne Knight, who played Newman, Jerry's nemesis, is in both the TV Show, and the film, "JFK." In both, he plays the same part in the courtroom reenactment. I don't know exactly what all this means, but I would submit for your approval that the JFK assassination is the tragic touchstone of our generation, and that Oliver Stone, in taking it as the subject of his film, was tackling the biggest issue of our time. It was bound to be controversial. Perhaps you will walk away from it still unconvinced. But even if it just gets you thinking, "JFK" has done its job.<br /><br />--------------<br />Guy Bannister: Camelot in smithereens.<br />=========================<br /><br />SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY OF JFK CAST MEMBERS<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0B0">Natural Born Killers</a> (1994) ....

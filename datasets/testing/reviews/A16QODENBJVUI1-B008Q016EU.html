<meta name="summary" content="Intentionally one of the most absurd films ever, but fun"></head><body><p>This is one of those films, like THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8th DIMENSION, that is over-the-top absurd.  Like Buckaroo Banzai, who was simultaneously a rock star, surgeon, scientist, and super adventurer, the three Angels in this film are all improbably talented.  By the end, they all started reminding me of Barbie dolls, and all about as convincing as a Barbie doll in each incarnation.  We get Kung Fun Barbie Doll followed by Computer Nerd Barbie Doll to be followed by Race Car Driver Barbie Doll.  At no point are any of the girls the tiniest bit convincing in their rolls.  In this regard, the film is as ridiculous as the original TV show, which despite being a hit was, in my mind, one of the worst shows ever.  The difference between the two shows, and what makes this film fun instead of awful, is the fact that the movie clearly intends all of this tongue in cheek, as a long, silly joke.<p>The problem with the movie is that while a self-parody is always fun, it isn't always a great self-parody.  Too many scenes are intended as a joke at the girls' expense, but it isn't developed with any wit or charm or skill.  That doesn't mean the film isn't slick; it is.  But as a whole the film doesn't live up to its own expectations.  There just isn't much depth or purpose, except to show three impossibly talented and beautiful women you simply can't accept as being that talented (though the beautiful part is easy).<p>The girls are well cast.  I always find Drew Barrymore to be adorable.  Cameron Diaz is fun, and is extremely convincing physically in her stunts.  She is not, however, at all convincing as a guy-shy female.  Lucy Liu provides good visual and ethnic contrast to the other two, but I don't like the bitchiness of her character, and while I completely applaud using an Asian actress in a major role, I just find her an almost completely unlikable actress, and her semi-dominatrix aura gets very, very old very, very quickly.  Undoubtedly this is because I have read too much about her in media gossip rags.  I have read that Thandie Newton originally was tagged for the role, and I wish that had happened.  <p>In the end, the film just doesn't quite gel, but because it doesn't take itself too seriously, it manages to be fun anyway.  This is one of those films that's great to watch on a Saturday night with a bunch of friends, when you can simultaneously enjoy and laugh at what's happening.  Laughing is OK; the makers of the film expect you to.</p></body></html>

There's something that makes Singin in the rain a magical experience, especially when it's stacked against the competition of musicals that threaten it's reputation.  Maybe musicals aren't my thing, but most songs are slow, drawn out, boring, and the same thing over and over again in most musicals.  Singin in the Rain is fast paced, sometimes implausable and plot hole-ridden (Who the hell conveices an idea like Cosmo and Don did to the RF?), but when your laughing at Lina's hideous vioce (I tend to go Mystery Science Theater 3000 and insult and answer her questions), feeling the rhythmic tap dancing, being hilarious entertained by the humor of it all, or just simple indulging in the movies extreme energy and charisma, who the ______ cares?  I sure don't, which is one reason why I enjoy this knockout movie quite the bit.<br /><br />MUSICAL NUMBERS (Music, dancing) 19/20<br /><br />There are only two things wrong with the music.  You Are My Lucky Star's great background music is utterly destroyed by the HORRIFYING lyrics, and You Were Meant For Me is saved by it's instrumental passage (the music is great beneath it, but the lyrics are pretty lame).  That's it.  Every other musical number is a knockout, and there is no filler of any kind.  Instrumentally, it recalls the glory days of those HOllywood numbers, as the background music is jazzy, upbeat, absolutely happy but never annoying or childish.  I also do love the score in the background as well, as it's also terrific.<br /><br />And as for the dancing, it's not the most brilliant or technically hard thing ever, but the performances never get old, with a lot of different styles besides tap.  Fred Astaire may have been graceful, but Gene Kelly had the energy.  Oh, and did you know he performed his famous number with a 103 degree fever?  Donald O' Conner follows suite, and this guy could even do a wall flip without wires.  Cyd Charisse's dancing is seductive and brilliant, and Debbie Reynolds, well, learned fast.  Everyone is a complete joy to watch, so let's just leave it at that.<br /><br />ART DIRECTION 10/10<br /><br />Keeping true to the fantasty Hollywood, I really can't help but love the look of this film.  They made great care to make the 20's Hollywood fully envisioned; Gene Kelly even looked at photographs at length to nail down the look.  I don't make a big deal about things such as costumes, but I think most of the costumes are great to look at.  Even if they aren't my taste (among then include the Dueling Cavalier costumes.  Somtimes things are better off being outdated), it still adds to the movie anyway.  Besides, it's what they wore back then, it's supposed to be depicing that time.  Even so, plenty of them look cool, so I guess it works.<br /><br />What I do love more is the architecture and interior design, which is much more my thing to look at.  I love all of the designs, and I also think the Broadway look was nailed as well, entirely painted like a dark room ride almost.  There's even some slick visual tricks in the midst, but that's really not the main focus of it.  It's just a great looking movie.<br /><br />CHARACTERS AND ACTING 18/20<br /><br />All the stars of the movie bring prescene, and as a consequence, the actors and actresses that play their perspective parts will never leave my mind.  For now one, Gene Kelly will always be Don Lockwood, and every other part will be Gene Kelly as "(insert role here)".  He's a great dancer and did much more than this, but this is the most memorable part he has ever done.  It goes for everybody else as well.<br /><br />As for the chracters, they aren't typically unique, but all of them memorable.  Jean Hagen will always be known as the lady with the most grating voice of all kind, and it's generally a funny movie.  Cyd Charisse makes a great appearance as the seductive gangster's girlfriend in the Broadway section, and it's easily one of the most memorable regarding females, a sort of sleazy girl who a flair for being dangerous and attractive at the same time.  Needless to say, while you won't learn anything from these characters, you certainly will love them all.<br /><br />STORY AND DIALOGUE 18/20<br /><br />The Story is another thing that makes this movie highly enjoyable.  While tons musicals contain an overblown romantic story, Singin' In the Rain's love story (done with subtley, thank god) takes a back seat to themes about deception of words, and the fact that the movie is largely about the film industry itself.  As everybody knows, the movie offers a comedic take on the bumpy road from silents from talkies.  The ending may be a bit predictable, but who cares?  The way is filled with a great script, memorable moments, great songs, and art direction.  There's hardly a dull moment in the whole thing.<br /><br />The dialogue is generally funny and always great, and features great lines, dry humor, and observations about the silent film era, and the acting of the time.  This is a very quotable movie despite the fact you will probably look like an uncool twit (verses saying the latest line from the Judd Apatow involded comedy movies that everybody loves).  Either way, highly highly memorable.<br /><br />This movie is the kind of movie that makes my day better at times, almost so if I have had my Grande Latte Enema and it hasn't even worn out.  if people think I'm too happy or something, _____ em'.  Heh, jokes on them if they know me (do you tend to notice that once you get know people, you sometimes like them less and less as much as you like them more and more?).  Singin' In the Rain is one of the very few things that I love that are happy and heartwarming, unlike many, many other forms of media (*cough* Titanc *cough*)that make me feel absolutely nothing.  This is a gem of a movie, and while it isn't perfect, nothing quite comes close to it.  The Citizen Kane of musicals?  Maybe, only it's actually deserving of it's place on the polls.</p></body></html>

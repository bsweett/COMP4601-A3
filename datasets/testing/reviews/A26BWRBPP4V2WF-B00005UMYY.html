<meta name="summary" content="Style trumps substance, but it's a better film because of it"></head><body><p>As most reviews mention, this film basically runs backwards - it's divided into 5-15 minute scenes, each scene ending where the previous scene started.  We meet the hero of the film, Leonard (Guy Pearce, in another great acting job) just as he has murdered a man named Teddy.  So we know what happened (Teddy is murdered), but we don't know why.  It turns out Leonard has brain damage and cannot make new long-term memories.  He can, however, condition himself (in a classical, Pavlovian sense), and so he writes notes to himself, takes pictures, and prints tatoos on his body to keep his life and quest straight.  The quest? - finding and killing the man who murdered his wife.  The first scene implies that Teddy must have been the murderer.  But is he, or is Leonard being set up by someone and can't remember it?  This is the crux of the question that is answered as we learn how Teddy came to be murdered.<br /><br />The gimmick - playing scenes in reverse order (but the scenes themselves play forward) - is essential for the enjoyment of the film.  First, it puts us squarely in the shoes of the protagonist, who always knows what he's doing, but doesn't really know why.  There are many visual clues - scratches on his face (how did they get there?), a picture of a man he's beaten up, a cryptic message on the photo of Teddy - "Don't believe his lies."  Second, the story is too straightforward to view in forward order - watching it in order would be no more interesting than a typical episode of Law and Order (much like viewing Pulp Fiction in chronological order).<br /><br />At this point, I should mention that the film has an unfair reputation of being difficult to follow and of being violent.  The most violent scene is, in fact, the opening credits, which are more violent by a long shot than the rest of the film.  Similarly, the film is not difficult to follow.  Sure, you may not be able to piece together every little detail (the same can be said for most good Film Noir) with just one viewing, but the answer to the question of the first scene - "why was Teddy killed and did he deserve to be" - is obviously resolved.<br /><br />There are two main problems with this DVD edition.  One is with the film: Leonard's memory problem seems to vary with the needs of the plot.  At times he can hold things in his head for a long time, at other times he forgets in the middle of doing something (for example, at one point he is in the process of running and can't remember why, but at another point he manages to gather up a bunch of items, drive to a deserted lot, and burn them, which must have taken quite some time).  This is something you only think about anfterwards, though, so it does not detract from the film.  The second problem, for which I deducted a star (it's really a 4-star film) is the fact that this particular DVD edition is extremely bare-bones.  There is a special edition of Memento, which would be the recommended format for repeated viewings.<br /><br />All-in-all, though, this is a very enjoyable movie.  It's the type of film that many people will want to own and watch repeatedly to understand all the little nuances of the plot.  That's not to say that the film doesn't hold up to a single viewing - it's very interesting and intriguing, mostly because of the manner in which the film is constructed, but also due to the actors, who do a good job throughout.</p></body></html>

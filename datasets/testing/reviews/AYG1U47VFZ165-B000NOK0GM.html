<meta name="summary" content="Earliest Film Noir"></head><body><p>The evaluation of THE THIRD MAN polarizes critics: it is either revered as one of the first &amp; finest forays into film noir or it is loathed for its production quality and an overwhelming emphasis on zither music.<p>Despite criticism, THE THIRD MAN is must-see viewing for any student of cinema.  The application of the camera upon the storytelling process is a truly eye-opening experience; the angles, the lighting, etc., is truly inspiring.  However, when the camera takes on a more traditional position in several scenes woven into the tale of Harry Lime, the narrative arguably grinds to a halt.  As well, Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles were at the top of the form here.<p>Additionally, THE THIRD MAN should be cited as one of the films to best use location photography.  Clearly, these aren't studio sets employed, and the true life locales gives the film perhaps its greatest haunting quality.<p>While there may have been hundreds of more entertaining film noirs made since THE THIRD MAN, keep in mind one simple fact when viewing it:  this is the first, and all that followed pay homage to it.</p></body></html>

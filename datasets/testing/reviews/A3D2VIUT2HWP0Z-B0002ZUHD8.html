<meta name="summary" content="Very Enjoyable"></head><body><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this retelling of the Arthur  legend in this very "Hollywood"  version. It has enough of the newly discovered material about Arthur, and Possible ( Dare I say Probable?) sources of the legend.<br /><br />The Extended version is just great... contains enough of the sort of material that the parents try and avoid such as "Great movie, but contained too much of the violence that little Johnny sees every day on the news, and I can't have him seeing some comic book version of the violence dare he get interested in fiction , and distracted too much "... anyways.<br /><br />Skarsgard was brilliant as the Saxon chief, and what a warrior, totally ruthless.<br /><br />Everyone in the film had enough charisma to fire the film along, and the imprisoned pagans who were there to save their souls told bundles about the "Christianity" of the period, with possible elements of the christianity promulgated now-a-days.<br /><br />The gore in this film is surprisingly not. I mean, its not the red gore, just lashings of chopped bits flying around the screen.<br /><br />Its not history, but its damn fine fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lots of unexpected thrills"></head><body><p>Colin Farrell stars in this thriller.  His character, a selfish work-aholic, answers a pay phone.  The caller threatens his life if he doesn't start donating his time to his loves ones.  The thrills begin the moment the phone rings.  Every scene after that makes "Phone Booth" worth watching at least once.  The intensity keeps the audience asking themselves what will happen next.  Forrest Wittacker and Katie Holmes give wonderful performances as a cop and Farrell's concerned and second girlfriend.  One will not be disappointed after watching this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Some miscasting, but a pleasantly diverting film."></head><body><p>Of course, one couldn't help but have very low expectations for The Da Vinci Code. Critics have been unmerciful.  Ron Howard was an odd pick for director.  Tom Hanks? He lacks sufficient gravitas (and in my book, acting ability, for the lead).  And can anyone understand all of what Audrey Tautou says under that thick, albeit authentic, accent?<br /><br />And yet, despite Ron Howard's penchant for the obvious and mundane, and Hanks' very low-key performance, The Da Vinci Code draws you in.  It's entertaining.  It isn't (thankfully) half as expository as it could have been. (Hanks seemed so strikingly unphysical and, moreso, unmasculine, that I started thinking he might be ill -- and trying to hide it.  He seemed slow and bloated, and simply not up to the task.)<br /><br />The book was pretty good, and so is the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Must Have For Fans of Burton"></head><body><p>Tim Burton comes through again with "Corpse Bride". The animation was absolutely fantastic and the acting was equally well done. Johnny Depp has real talent, his voice acting really is amazing! It doesn't even sound like Depp talking for Victor, very well done. All of the actors were great and it had some big names and Burton regulars in the film. Christopher Lee was great as the town pastor. The story had characters that had a lot of emotion and you feel a lot of emotion for. A movie can have amazing animation and acting, but if the story isn't good, the movie fails and is a flop. Luckily, that is not the case here.<br /><br />The musical scores of the film, while not up to parr with the memorable songs from "Nightmare", are still quite good. Would I say that this is as good as "Nightmare Before Christmas"? No, but that is not in the least saying that this film is bad. This movie is excellent! It is extremely far away from being terrible, but "Nightmare" was just a ground breaking film that I didn't expect this would top. If you are a Burton fan and a fan of the original "Nightmare Before Christmas", get this movie now! The story tear jerking, the acting is excellent and the animation is amazing! Truly one of the greatest movies of the decade.</p></body></html>

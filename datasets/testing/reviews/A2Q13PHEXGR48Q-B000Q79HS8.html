<meta name="summary" content="Just as good, and maybe better, than Identity"></head><body><p>The Bourne Supremacy is an excellent action/thriller that will keep you riveted throughout.  Ex-CIA assasin, Jason Bourne, is now living in peace in India with his girlfriend, Marie, after leaving behind his forgotten past.  When Bourne is framed for the murder of two agents in Berlin, he must return to what he knows best to prove that he is innocent.  At times, the plot is confusing, but in the overall picture it doesn't really matter.  This movie never slows down from beginning to end.  Great action throughout, especially a high-speed car chase through the streets of Moscow, one of the best chases ever put on screen.  Plenty of exotic locations as well with Bourne globe-hopping in India, Berlin, London, and Moscow.  While the plot may at times be confusing with plenty of twists and turns, this is still a great action movie.  It isn't essential to see The Bourne Identity first, but it will help you understand more.  Highly recommended sequel.<br /><br />  Matt Damon once again is excellent as CIA assasin and amnesiac, Jason Bourne.  He is very believable as a secret agent torn apart by inner demons that he must deal with.  Franke Potente returns as Marie, Bourne's girlfriend living with him in India.  Brian Cox is also very good as Ward Abbott, CIA supervisor helping in the search for Bourne.  Joan Allen plays Pamela Landy, the CIA officer trying to track down Bourne for the murder of two of her own agents.  Karl Urban is perfectly creepy as Kirill, a Russian hitman hired to kill Bourne no matter what the cost.  The movie also stars Julia Stiles, returning as Nicky from Identity, Gabriel Mann as agent Danny Zorn, Marton Csokas as Jarda.  Highly enjoyable action/thriller with great action sequences and characters.  Once again, Matt Damon proves he can be an action star.

<meta name="summary" content="MEL'S ECLAIR"></head><body><p>BRAVEHEART is like a gigantic, beautifully ornamented chocolate eclair, beautiful and delicious looking, but once you bite in to it, you realize how little there really is inside.<br /><br />In a recent poll of critics, BRAVEHEART was listed as one of Oscar's "embarrassments"---a film that should not have won the Best Picture Oscar.  I tend to agree, although I do not dismiss the fact that Mel Gibson has mounted a sumptuous, rousing, extremely visceral adventure about a man and his quest for freedom.  The battle scenes are some of the best of this nature ever put on film.  Gibson does overuse slomo; he does paint William Wallace as a Christ-like martyr, and as he would do years later in his controversial "Passion," Gibson subjects his hero to an extended torture scene, with his fellow soldiers hiding out ala the apostles while Wallace is tortured.  Accused of making Passion his ego piece, I would venture to say that BRAVEHEART is a far bigger ego trip than Passion.  Gibson stars, directs and commandeers the movie in his image and likeness.  Mel is a smart and shrewed showman; his performance is average.  Some of the supporting actors are outstanding:  Angus McFadyen as the self-centered, self-tortured Robert of Bruce, who both befriends and betrays Wallace; Patrick McGoohan as the evil King Edward deLongshanks, a man whose own cruelty is matched by his lack of mercy and compassion; Catherine McCormack as Mel's doomed wife, whose quiet peasant beauty belies an earthly intelligence; Sophie Marceau as Prince Edward's wife, whose longing for love is captured in the glance of her gorgeous eyes; Brendan Gleeson, always dependable, this time as Gibson's big, boisterous sidekick, and Ian Bannen as the leprosy-ridden father of Robert, whose display of unimpassioned coldness both alienates and commands his son.<br /><br />Yes, an eclair; maybe shouldn't be a Best Picture Oscar winner, but one can't deny Gibson has mounted a rousing, if vacuous, entertainment.</p></body></html>

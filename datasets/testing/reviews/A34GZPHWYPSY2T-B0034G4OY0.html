Steven Spielberg, 2010, in English and French) is a riveting yet meditative, profound crossroads of several stories. A retired San Franciscan psychic who's fed up communicating with the dead (Matt Damon) needs time for himself. A struggling young English single mother and her twin boys (Lyndsey Marshal, Frankie and George McLaren) enter a new realm of suffering. A traumatized French anchorwoman (the stunning C&eacute;cile De France) needs to get her newly learned message to the world, and in the process loses her boyfriend (an equally gorgeous Thierry Neuvic).<br /><br />To begin, I have to hand it Eastwood, I really do. I consider myself not only a connoisseur of his work from The Man With No Name to Dirty Harry; I'm also one of his biggest admirers when he wears his director's hat. This film made me weep, several times. It made me gasp and scream in dismay, it made me feel deeply. Not an easy task with a PG-13 rating, no swearing, no real violence and nothing creepy in spite of the life-after-death motif.<br /><br />Eastwood presents a true director's masterpiece, relying on CGI only because he couldn't otherwise get what he needed in a major scene (being in the middle of a tsunami wave, an integral part of the story, will leave you and countless generations hereafter breathless). Otherwise, this film is in the quiet, grand style, the Old School, of fine filmmaking.<br /><br />Each character's woes and tribulations will culminate in a meeting at the London Book Fair - and need I say this has a bittersweet, totally satisfying ending? Typical Eastwood, who gives us cinematic banquets. He's best at first courses and desserts! - I think any film connoisseur will tell you, that is all you need for a great story. Even the hilarious dalliance into the world of fraudulent mediums (aren't they all?) is a treat.<br /><br />If I may criticize only two typical Eastwood elements here: the excessively slow pace and the music. Such a film needs no great pace, but at two hours it can make one a bit sleepy. The music, well, jazz acoustic guitar has a time/place - Eastwood doesn't seem to understand that very well. But Eastwood is in no hurry with this, he directs his stars to perfection and he absolutely loves the details. He wants us to love them, too, which we cannot help but to love along with him.<br /><br />The film is sweetened with little cameos by Derek Jacobi, Steve Schirripa and Bryce Dallas Howard; it is also beautifully spiced with locations at San Francisco, London and Paris. I might even say Google makes a rather prominent appearance and is integral to the slowly merging story lines. Setting aside my banquet analogy, Eastwood simultaneously makes his films the way top of the line perfumes are constructed.<br /><br />I know Eastwood wanted this to be along the lines of similar French films, but he need not have turned to that influence at all. At present I'd say films everywhere are being influenced by Eastwood's directing.<br /><br />You cannot miss this film, one of Eastwood's sleeper-classics. It scored no huge points, was paid little attention, and I wonder who else has really reviewed it. All I can conclude is to advise you not to miss it - it's well worth the investment of emotions, even if you don't believe in or care a fig about any HEREAFTER.<br /><br />Eastwood's HEREAFTER is all you'll ever need.</p></body></html>

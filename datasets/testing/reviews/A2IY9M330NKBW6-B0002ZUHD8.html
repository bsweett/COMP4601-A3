The director, Antoine Fuqua, has essentially remade his previous film Tears of the Sun and couched it within the Arthurian legend. Hear Clive Owen plays the Bruce Willis role.<br /><br />The Good Stuff: If there ever was a King Arthur this is more in line with what historians think they know about him. His half Roman, half British blood line. His being a commander in the Roman Army, etc.  You also have Hadrian's Wall, the Roman rule, The Sarmatian horsemen, the local tribes who paint themselves blue and a host of other things. This is also a very thrilling movie. There's bravery, valor, great battle scenes, all for one and one for all and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear. What else is there?!<br /><br />The Bad Stuff: Some of the dialogue is a bit clunky.<br /><br />But the movie is cool. They take some of what we've been told about the legend and use those same components in a more natural way. Excaliber and the drawing of it from the stone (here it's his father's grave) are less magical and more real. The magic here comes from the earth itself. The forests, mountains, rivers and forests are all shot to give the land a personality of its own. A mysticism of its own. And did I mention Keir Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear? What else is there?!<br /><br />Fuqua does a nice job directing here. He seems to have keyed in on the Ridley Scott school of film making as this movie has a very sweeping quality to it. It's a big movie with a great look, a good musical score and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear.<br />If you've seen the waaayyyy silly Excaliber you should like this miles better.</p></body></html>

The story about how Elvis didn't die and just switched lives with an impersonator is pretty clever. While it's also funny about how the late great Ossie Davis plays JFK that claims he was dyed black after his assination attempt. I would've gave it a higher rating but it gets a little too campy at the end and Campbell's performance isn't as good as it was in the beginning. He still makes  a very likeable sleazy old Elvis though. While Ossie Davis is brilliant and funny in one of his last roles.  I can't lie and say this is the best movie you'll ever see but I can say that it at least deserves a try.</p></body></html>

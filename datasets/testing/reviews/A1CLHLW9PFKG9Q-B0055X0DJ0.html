(The only reason to see a Transformers film)<br /><br />Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen brings back the characters from the first movie:<br /><br />Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky<br />Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes<br />Josh Duhamel as Major Lennox<br />John Turturro as Agent Simmons<br /><br />And John Leguizamo wannabe Ramon Rodriguez as Leo Spitz.<br /><br />I've already mentioned the sexual jokes that had no purpose in this film. They weren't funny and were totally inappropriate.<br /><br />The lack of Optimus Prime (no spoilers): he isn't in this film very much. BIG, HUGE mistake Mr Bay and your writers. And instead you fill that time with two minor autobots who try to be funny (think Jar Jar Binks).<br /><br />The action sequences were better. I could follow who was fighting whom. And the explosions - I liked the nice big one at the end - were nice eye-candy.<br /><br />But the story was the best they could do considering the Writer's Strike of last year. With all the new robots, it's hard to create a character-driven story like the last one (what am I saying?!?!?!).<br /><br />You can definitely tell how Michael Bay feels about President Obama and his foreign policy. The jabs given are aimed at liberals and those who aren't too keen on the U.S. military. Speaking of the military, they really get to shine and explode in this film as they do most Michael Bay films.<br /><br />Even though it's raking in the big bucks (think Spider-Man 3), people will remember this sequel as another poor attempt at milking a franchise. And it's only the second film!<br /><br />This film may even fail to be picked up and added to my DVD collection (A true sign of lameness). Let's hope Transformers 3 will be the final film.</p></body></html>

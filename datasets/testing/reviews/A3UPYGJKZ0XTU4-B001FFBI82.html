<meta name="summary" content="A Marine in Operation Desert Storm: Chronic Tedium & Acute Horror."></head><body><p>"Jarhead" is based on Anthony Swofford's memoir "Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles" about his experiences as a Marine during the Untied States' first military action against Iraq, Operation Desert Storm. The book was considerably condensed and adapted for the screen by William Broyles, Jr., a former Marine himself who served in the Vietnam War. Corporal Anthony "Swoff" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) narrates the film, beginning in boot camp, when he first questions the wisdom of joining the Marines. In training for the elite STA Platoon, where he will be a sniper, Swoff meets Corporal Alan Troy (Peter Saarsgard), who becomes his friend and mentor. Their platoon, under the command of Marine Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), is among the first to be deployed in Operation Desert Shield after Iraq invades Kuwait. And so the wait for war begins. Hot, dehydrated, and always anxious about wives and girlfriends back home, the men get stir crazy wondering if they'll ever see any action.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is an exploration of what it was like to be a Marine in a particular place and time. More than any other war movie I have seen, "Jarhead" conveys the tedium of war. Anthony Swofford's platoon saw little action, but what they did see is rendered so visually stunning that it makes a real impression. The fact that there isn't much action allows the film to concentrate on the personalities and relationships of the men of 2nd Platoon. That's not to say the film is dull; it is deftly paced to keep us interested. And the scenes of the Kuwaiti oil wells afire, raining black gold for miles and billowing toxic fumes, are worth the price of the movie alone. Jamie Foxx delivers another strong performance as a man who loves being a Marine, looks forward to a long career, and is sympathetic to the young men under his command but at the same time contrasted to them. "Jarhead" offers some insight into the Marines' lifestyle as well as the frustration of these men who were sent to wait idly to do their jobs and then thrust into a phantasmagory of desert and fire.<br /><br />The DVD (MCA 2006): Bonus features include 3 sets of deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Sam Mendes and editor Walter Murch and 2 full audio commentaries. "Swoff's Fantasies" are 4 short deleted scenes. "News Interviews in Full" (16 ? min) are much longer versions of the press interviews that the Marines give in the movie. And there are 11 miscellaneous "Deleted Scenes". I didn't find much of interest in the deleted scenes, but the audio commentaries are good. The first audio commentary by director Sam Mendes is a detailed scene-by-scene "who, what, and why" of what was included in the film, what was left out, and how the film is structured. This is more about filmmaking than about themes. The second audio commentary is by author Anthony Swofford and screenwriter William Broyles, Jr.  They talk about their mutual experiences in the military as it relates to the film, the film's characters, its structure, and condensing the book for the screen. English captions are available for the movie. Subtitles and dubbing are available in Spanish & French.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="nice special effects, but little more than a formula flick without soul"></head><body><p>This a pretty much the same film as Iron Man 1:  Stark is out of control, but has a good heart and is trying to be a better person in spite of his celebrity.  Pepper is the straight one, trying to hold it together.  And then, there is a serious baddie who has mastered a technology that threatens Iron Man, allied with an industrialist/rival whose inferiority is matched only by his evil nature.  Slam bang boom.<br /><br />Recommended as passtime fun, definitely for the background.</p></body></html>

Yet we critically forget his 2 finest films: Stargate and the Patriot. It's been 8 years since ID4 and he again destroys the world(and New York for the 3rd time) but it's more spectacular than that despite logic and dialogue.<br /><br />Jack Hall(why is main characters always Jack for some reason?) is a paleoclimatologist which means he studys the weather that exists 1000's of years ago. He says that melting ice caps will disrupt the climate flow which means we'll enter a new ice age. Of course, no one believes him, including a Dick Cheney look-alike. And he still doesn't believe him afterwards. But soon, Scotland is hit with a hurricane where the eye of it is -150 F and instantly freezes you in about 7 seconds. Hail the size of footballs crash into Tokyo. Tornadoes ravage Los Angeles and a massive tsunami hits New York and then freezes, blanketing the Big Apple in snow.<br /><br />Come for the effects if you have to. My favorite scene is probably the tsunami hitting New York even though it has an incredibly lame tension builder(super cute Emmy Rossum goes back to a cab when the tsunami is blocks away to get....a bag? Whatever). The LA tornadoes are next where you have those annoying newscasters right in the middle of a disaster reporting when they should get out of here getting nailed by LA's favorite billboard, Angeline. Some CG isn't that great: the wolves don't look realistic and for some reason the New York tsunami wave looks a bit too dark while Deep Impact's wave(also hitting New York) was in broad daylight.<br /><br />Don't come here expecting to get research for a paper. The chances of it happening that fast is really stretching it and don't ask me to explain the science of certain things like the idea of the super-freezing hurricane. Like the Core, it's awesome and cool to behold but your brain should be off as to not end up spending the entire movie figuring out the science of it. But still, go for the effects...and Emmy Rossum.</p></body></html>

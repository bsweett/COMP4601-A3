Until checking the reviews, I didn't realize this was once a comic book, but when watching the DVD, I definitely got the feeling that the directors had a good time as many crazy shape-shifting and skin-morphing special effects that they could pull off.<br /><br />[...]  He delivers everything in his stoner monotone and has no range of emotion.  Everyone in the movie, in fact, showed no emotion.  No one ever got excited or agitated--they maintained the same calm, steady pace no matter whether they were doing something mundane or trying to save the future of mankind.<br /><br />This plot had a lot of potential, but it seems like the focus was on neat-o special effects and not on decent acting.</p></body></html>

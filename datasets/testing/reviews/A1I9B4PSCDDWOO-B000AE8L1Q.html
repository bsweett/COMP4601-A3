To be real, this is a movie for mature audience. The theater I was in was half packed and most of the audience was older then I was (being in my mid-40s).<br /><br />This film was blessed by two major factors, Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Allen was near perfect as a woman betrayed (so she thought for most of the movie) and her anger (coupled with some hard drinking) kept her sane and strong although terribly hard to deal with from her four daughters' perceptions. Its a joy watching an artist at work as Allen totally dominate the screen every single scene she appears in. Kevin Costner always does well when he doesn't have to carry the film and playing a sort of a supporting player. This movie is definitely a "Joan Allen movie" instead of "Kevin Costner flick".<br /><br />The film was well supported by supporting actors and actresses which kept the story fresh and characters interesting. Maybe that may be the secret of this film, that lead characters of Allen and Costner are not very likable initially but yet they grow on you as the time passes. By the time the movie ends, and as they evolved as people, you began to root for their happiness.<br /><br />I found the suprise twist at the end to be bit too off-centered for my taste. It was for me, the weakest point of the movie that rises more questions then answers. If you see it, you will know why and asked the same questions that I did which the movie cannot answer. A weak link, luckily it only come at the end and doesn't the spoil the film as whole.<br /><br />Movie geared toward the late middle age crowd. I think most of the younger generation folks might get into it if they don't get bore first. But they can learn from it since they'll get old too someday.</p></body></html>

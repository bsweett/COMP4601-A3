So, Would It Have Been Better If Bryan Singer Stayed With It?"></head><body><p>MOVIE: The supposed final installment in the X-Men trilogy opened to some amazing numbers, but the overall experience was less than spectacular. Sure it was entertaining with some amazing visual effects, but it was just very plain and did not exceed or offer anything new. The movie never felt like it was going anywhere, I never felt a sense of progression or a sense of accomplishment by the time it ended. We all know the story, Magneto continues to lead an army of mutants against humanity to prevent them from mass producing a cure to the mutant gene. The objective is to infilitrate Alcatraz Island and kill the boy who they are harvesting the ingrediants from that are necessary to making the vaccine. The movie is a short 1 hour and 45 minutes, and the pacing is incredibly horrible. We open with a flashback where Xavier and Magneto go to recruit Jean Grey to the school. Here we see the very creepy and digitally altered faces of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen so that they seem young since it is a flashback. The digital age reversal was obvious and was the only CGI work that I found awkward. The rest of the movie tries to create character relations between Jean Gray and Wolverine, but fails miserably. The whole film is incredibly hallow and empty, there is no substance to it. That is one noticeable difference that we see from Brett Ratner taking the director's chair. 20th Century Fox didn't want to wait for Bryan Singer since he was doing Superman, so they wen't along with the production and hired Ratner. Why couldn't they wait is beyond me, it wouldn't have affected box office performance, Memorial Day Weekend is an overrated movie weekend in my opinion. So, with no interesting character relations we are left with a very disorganized and melodramatic action movie. The visual effects and the make-up in the film were astounding, and so was John Powell's score. I thought that John Powell did a much better job with the music than John Ottman did. One huge thing that I caught in the movie that really bothered me was that there was a huge continuity error. It happened right after Magneto detached the Golden Gate Bridge and put it on Alcatraz. Right before he places the bridge down it is broad daylight. However, instantaneously we switch from day to night. There was no time transition or cutaway to signal a passage of time. It really bothered me that they let something like that slip into such a high profile film as this. So, instead of being an intelligent film about the intolerance of mankind, we now get a shallow and simplemined action film.<br /><br />ACTING: All the parts were overacted to a point where it became painful to listen to some lines. Some of the dialogue was delivered so poorly, and there were a few one-liners that lacked the punch they needed. Ian McKellen is the only strength of the film with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart delivering good performances as well. The rest of the cast was just plain bad. Vinny Jones as Juggernaut was rediculous, and so was Kelsey Grammer as Beast. How Halle Berry won an Oscar still baffles me since she cannot act to save her life. Famke Janssen noticeably overacts as well, I mean how is she supposed to play two people if she is hardly able to handle just one. I blame the script for the acting problems given the poor dialogue.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: What kind of "Last Stand" was this? They left the end so wide open for another installment. Also, if you stay and watch the credits there is a bonus scene afterwards that also leaves the movie even wider open for another installment. They are already working on spin-offs of Wolverine and Magneto, so I really can't see Fox stopping with the main X-Men series since it's proven to be such a huge moneymaker. I really think this movie could have been so much better than it was. I don't know if Brett Ratner is the one to blame given the poor structure of the movie overall. His direction and vision was consistant and uniquely different from that of Singer's, but the movie falls short of being anything more than a bland summer action fare.</p></body></html>

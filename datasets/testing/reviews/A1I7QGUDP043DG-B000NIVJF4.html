Based on some true events, Amin befriends a young Scottish doctor trying to find his place in the world, but Dr. Garrigan isn't prepared for the moody dictator's secret dark side. Amin betrays his friends, family and his people when his positive speeches of helping all Uganda turn out to be a layer of lies. Amin's rule becomes a nightmare and Dr. Garrigan doesn't open his eyes to the truth soon enough. The acting in this movie is just outstanding with very memorable roles. I'm certainly prompted to pick up the book that inspired the movie given the great visual version of this story.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

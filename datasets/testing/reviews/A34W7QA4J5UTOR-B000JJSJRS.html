<meta name="summary" content="The Mummy Returns"></head><body><p>Great movie. Full of action. Great special effects. It's as funny as the first one. There are a few points I thought were poorly done. Brendan Fraser's character sports a significant tatoo that he didn't have in the first movie. His wife suddenly recalls a former life as Nefertitti. And one cannot forget a certain flying balloon attached to a ship! These things are none too distracting and it's a very enjoyable film.  Well worth watching.</p></body></html>

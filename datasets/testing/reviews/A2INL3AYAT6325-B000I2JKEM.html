<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable film & great to look at"></head><body><p>I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas".<br /><br />So, it did not surprise me that I enjoyed this film.<br /><br />Music not as good as Nightmare.<br /><br />In the 12 years between the 2 films the film looked great.  I was really impressed with the look & style of the film.  In other words, it had a gorgeous look to it.<br /><br />The extra on the DVD were good as well.  Other film makers can learn from this DVD package.  A lot of recent DVD releases have LITTLE TO NO EXTRAS AT ALL.  This package has multiple extras.  A plus to me in a DVD package.</p></body></html>

The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.<br /><br />First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.<br /><br />This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.<br /><br />Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place.</p></body></html>

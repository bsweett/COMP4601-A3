<meta name="summary" content="Visually arresting and intelligent, but not destined to be a classic."></head><body><p>Ridley Scott, while making many other films during his almost 40-year career, is still most beloved for his work within the Sci-Fi genre with the original ALIEN and the neo-futuristic noir BLADE RUNNER. While I don't share most fans' love for ALIEN (I think it's a triumpth of design and style over substance), I do go gaga over the fascinatingly dark and deeply intelligent BLADE RUNNER. So I'm relatively sure that it will anger some people out there that in my opinion, Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre after a 30-year absence in PROMETHEUS is a thematically superior film to ALIEN, but will never be a classic such as ALIEN was destined to become.<br /><br />I will never fault a film or its creators for thinking big, and that's definitely what's going on here. Written by master mindbender Damon Lindelof (the love him/hate him co-creator of LOST) and Jon Spaihts (writer of the high-concept flop THE DARKEST HOUR), we start with a bizarre, mood-setting prologue presumably millions of years ago, and then jump to the year 2089 where we have Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish MILLENNIUM trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green, who looks like a stringier Tom Hardy and that character name HAS to be a easter-egg reference to LOST) discovering on Earth a pictographic pattern amongst great civilzations of the past separated by centuries and great distance. They believe it to be a star map and present this to the old, dying trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in convincing old-man makeup) and thus begins the adventure of discovering the origins of Earth's species in a two-year space flight in the massive ship dubbed "Prometheus" named for the Greek mythological figure who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Upon arrival at their destination they pulled from this star map which is a moon for the planet LV-223, all of the crew members are awoken from their cryogenic sleep by David (Michael Fassbender), the resident synthetic (or "artifical person", if you will). The crew, led by company woman Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the ship's captain Janek (Idris Elba), set down on a moon in this far-flung galaxy. Once there, they start exploring a pyramid-like structure and, in true sci-fi horror fashion, the greatest discovery in scientific history may very well mark the end of our history.<br /><br />The film has a number of problems once things really get underway. My first problems are matters of pet peeves rather than distinct criticisms: I do NOT like it when futuristic films put a specific year on them; just say "The Future", or put it so far in the future that this technology may seem charming and antiquated. Also, as in the STAR WARS prequels, it's not a terribly good idea to have technology be more advanced than what we see in the stories that are supposed to come AFTER this. Now comes my real criticisms: Certain members of the crew are such obvious "red shirts" that you know they will meet their fate before too long, however that works both ways as a major character meets their fate somewhat early on in the film which does up the ante for all of the crew. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and some character motivations are murky or just plain indecipherable. Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw is obviously meant to fit into the Ellen Ripley mold, which is especially apparent during the film's most visceral and suspenseful scene which involves a horrifying self-surgery, but she somehow doesn't quite fit. She's alternately too demure and then too aggressive. There is also a significant reveal that comes near the beginning of the third act that should have more impact than it does, but it just feels inorganic. Also the character of Vickers as being the "company woman" for Weyland Industries is designed for you to hate almost immediately; she's far too cold and self-serving. She plays the role very well, but when her character is given a spin that could make her more sympathetic, it doesn't go that way. Even Carter Burke had moments of genuine likability. The character of Janek, as played by Elba, is less of a character and more of a cliche, and it's a sad waste of such a talented actor (He's Stringer Bell, for god's sakes!). And Scott doesn't really have too many edge-of-your-seat moments that a film like this would need particularly in the film's climactic 'battle' which is more of a footnote rather than epic confrontation. Another big problem is that this has essentially already been designed as a franchise rather than a self-contained story. That may be a studio decision (knowing Fox, it probably was), but it still hurts the film more than helps it. And there is a death of another major character in this film that is done so ridiculously that it actually made me kind of angry.<br /><br />However, when the film does work, it REALLY works well. The scenes of initial discovery are incredibly absorbing and the production design work by Arthur Max (designer of every Ridley Scott film since G.I. JANE as well as David Fincher's SE7EN) is stunning to behold. The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski (DP of all of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films, but my favorite work of his is Alex Proyas' underrated masterpiece DARK CITY) is crisp and moody, and the team at Weta Digital who did the effects work did some eye-popping work as well. The philosophical/theological themes and ideas are handled in an intelligent and thought-provoking fashion, and when the suspense is really unleashed, it's far more effective than the large-scale set pieces. The show is essentially stolen right out from everyone else by the brilliant work by Fassbender (who I believe to be one of the hardest working men in the business right now), who is charming and eerie in his childlike fascination, and seems so eager to please, despite his true motives. His moments, even when he's done something truly terrible, are still done with such a benevolence that you know that everything terrible he's doing is not his responsibility, and he does play to a certain regret as he seems to grow throughout the film. Marc Streitenfeld's (also all of Scott's films since AMERICAN GANGSTER) score is somewhat restrained, and that's unusual in a film like this, until the suspense racks up and we're flooded in sound and fury.<br /><br />While this doesn't directly link to the ALIEN franchise, it obviously went out of its way to make sure it was in the same universe, with the whole expedition being financed and overseen by Weyland Industries (which would later become Weyland-Yutani, the company that sent out The Nostromo), and finding these strange and aggressive species on LV-223. As I stated before, this film doesn't present a self-contained story lending itself very obviously to a sequel or entire new franchise for Fox to explore (and eventually exploit, because after all... it's Fox) and so, all the questions that are posed in this film are left relatively unexplored and whether or not we'll see more classical versions of face-huggers, chest-bursters or xenomorphs in future films is up in the air. There is something to work with there both on a thematic and visceral scale, but like the previous ALIEN franchise, it's unlikely that we'll see Ridley Scott returning.<br /><br />I certainly didn't love this film, because when it is good, it's really very good, and when it's bad, it's more innocuous rather than totally debilitating. But unless Fox decides to cede more (or less, depending upon whatever made the film less than stellar) control to the creative team of this film, I'm sure that any further adventures of the remaining crew members of PROMETHEUS might be similarly hamstrung.<br /><br />3.5/5 Stars</p></body></html>

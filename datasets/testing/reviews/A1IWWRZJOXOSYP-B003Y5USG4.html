Jan de Bont who became a star director with "Speed" & then faded with "Speed 2" & "The Haunting" does an excellent job piloting this project.  The film was nominated for Oscars for Best Sound & Best Visual Effects.  Bill Paxton who was creepy in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AUJR">Frailty</a> plays Bill Harding who is trying to get his ex-wife to sign divorce papers.  Paxton may not have great depth; but in a film which hinges on visual effects, he does a good job.  He shows up with his fiancee Melissa who is a sex therapist.  Jami Gertz plays the character as a prissy, overly organized person who is out of place with these storm chasers.  Helen Hunt who won an Oscar for "As Good As It Gets" & a Golden Globe for TV's "Mad About You," is the real star as Jo Harding.  Jo is driven by the childhood loss of her father to a tornado and researches to improve early warning capability.  She is emotionally still attached to Bill and finds it difficult to let go.  As the day of tornados gets underway, the interplay between the two sparks the film, similar to the great formula for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04FG">Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)</a> where Angelina Joli & Brad Pitt played spouses who argue throughout the action.<br /><br />Many of the smaller parts are well played despite the snippets of dialogue.  Lois Smith who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006TL806">P.S.</a> & played Jack Nicholson's sister in "Five Easy Pieces" plays Aunt Meg who is always glad to see her niece and feed her crowd.  Alan Ruck who worked with de Bont on "Speed" and was recently in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC6Y">The Happening</a> plays Rabbit who continually checks maps.  Gary Busey's son Jake plays a mobile lab technician.  Philip Seymour Hoffman who would later be nominated for an Oscar for "Charlie Wilson's War" and win one for "Capote" plays the rock blasting Dusty who talks to Melissa about "the suck zone."  By the time the final frames arrive, we feel like we've been as close to a tornado as we are ever likely to want to get.  There are a few extras on the DVD scenes that give an appreciation for the lean cut de Bont made for the film.  In addition, Van Halen do a music video on what is also the excellent soundtrack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002N7W">Twister: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

He's up there with Baz Luhrmann who does those extravagent musicals such as Moulin Rouge. What impressed me from his first movie was how daring he made scenes that were already tough enough to get made. Filming intricate and coordinated scenes such as the ballroom dance that flirts for minutes with blind footmoves and difficult/fast lines. And he does it again in Atonement, though with more of an observant approach, with the four minute beach scene, seemingly pain free. I marvel at how he handles such difficult scenes, and it keeps me enthralled because in all seriousness I have to dig into the sacred past and compare him even to a young Stanley Kubrick in how he choreographed Spartacus. It is early, but I get the sense that given enough money and backing he could muster his epic masterpiece as well. We have to remember that Joe's been working with Focus films and that's an independant film company with little money to spare for exuberance. He hasn't been the helm of a gargantua film project like Spielberg or Peter Jackson, but we are looking at the blossoming of a very gifted director. I'm using one of my prediction cards on this one in saying that Joe will be in the likes of the giant company of some of our most respected Directors given time.</p></body></html>

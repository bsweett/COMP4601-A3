She chose the celebrated Tamm Academy of Freiborg.  One day, at nine in the morning, she left Kennedy Airport, New York, and arrived in Germany at 10:40 PM, local time."<p>So begins a journey that the American girl would never have anticipated in her wildest dreams.  A student, Patty Newman, is seen leaving the in the pouring rain scared...  That is nothing compared to the gruesome manner of her death at her girlfriend's flat.  It ends with the painted ceiling glass bulging out and shattering towards the foyer, followed by Patty's garrotted, bloody body crashing downward from a worm's eye view.  Exquisite!  Bulging is also used in Inferno when the body of Mark's fellow student crashes down in front of him.<p>Suzy is the only likeable character here.  She is pretty, shy, humble, but most important of all, she is intelligent and intuitive, which helps her during her stay.  And Jessica Harper makes her a credible unique person the viewer roots for.<p>Alida Valli is also effective as the forbidding Miss Tanner, a typical supervisor-type Guardian.  1940's star Joan Bennett (Madame Blanc) is a more tempered Guardian, but nevertheless gives the presence that she is in charge.  I don't know who plays the fat piggy-eyed servant.  The character, who plays a semi-important role here, seems to have been raised on ugly pills all her life.<p>This movie if anything, is representative of Dario Argento's wild use of lights.  Red and blue are the key colours here.  The exterior of the academy is red, as are the carpeted panels in the hallways.  My favorite use of red is when the girls are in the practice hall, converted to a makeshift dormitory.  The hall is bathed in a hellish red glare.  The shape of the directress behind Suzy and Sarah is nothing compared to the guttural, asthmatic snores emanating from that mysterious personage.  Creepy with a capital creep!  Red is also the colour of blood, and there is a lot of that here, as well as the wine Suzy has to drink during her restricted diet.<p>Blue light is seen when Ms. Tanner marches up the attic to find out where the maggots are coming from.  The creatures fall down through ceiling cracks and into dorm rooms, causing mass hysteria among the girls.  Suzy freaks out, but that's nothing compared to the reaction of the other girls.  Pandemonium, to say the least.  The way Argento stages their emergence is unexpected and gradual.<p>And Goblin's wild and weird score of screams, insanely pounding drums, guitars, echoing hisses of "witch" and of course sighs (Suspiria is Italian for sigh) might as well mirror Argento's perverse mind.<p>Suspiria is more a triumph of design and suspense rather than logic (e.g. why kill Daniel the pianist?), and it's important to remember that in order to enjoy this stunning film.  American and British horror have nothing on this masterpiece!</p></body></html>

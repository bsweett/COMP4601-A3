<meta name="summary" content="Mel Gibson seems to be the only person making these kinds of films. And from his own pocket too."></head><body><p>The description of 'graphic violence'attached to the poster of Apocalypto should be changed to 'unfathomable violence!" Every periodical I could get my hands on pointed out the same. It's what we've come to expect from a Gibson film. Then you have the style that only Gibson can bring to a film, oscar potential. Yet, he's unafraid to pull techniques from the "everyman's director book." He'll use slow motion. He'll have impossible chase scenes, (waterfall jump) but all in superb form! Somehow, in between horror freaks and hungry arthouse schoolers, you have this film fit into. What audiance is that? I wonder how well this film will do. I saw this film on the first Saturday it opened, during the afternoon. It was half filled. Pretty good, considering how informed audiences tend to be. I'm sure more than half of them knew about the vomit enducing violence. And about Gibson's tirade(s).<br /><br />  I've read it's an "Arthouse film for Jocks." It certainly brings the action for the jocks, and the after movie gossip fuel. It also has been out there in mainstream news for a bit. It's been delayed for how long? And was it rain? Hmmm, Public corespondent.... Not to mention how even before it was released, nations of outraged people were denouncing it. I'm gonna stay away from taking any sides. As a movie, it deserves a shot. But, maybe it's impossible for me to see it again. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean it in a "Passion" way. Gibson is a determined man, who choses to apply his fortunes to projects no-one, I mean no-one would touch with a ten foot pole.</p></body></html>

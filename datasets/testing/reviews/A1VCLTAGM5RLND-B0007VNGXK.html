<meta name="summary" content="I thought this movie was original"></head><body><p>I heared that Hellboy was off a comic book. Hellboy is near classic of great proportion as played by the underrated Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast) Perlman is an actor you probley wouldn't recognize as he has had to wear so much facial make up in his career. Also he played in a lot of low budget movies. He imbues 'Hellboy' with a real humanity and a scathing wit. How am I ever gonna get a girl when I drive around in a garbage truck? John Hurt as his father has a little to do but that he loves Hellboy there is no doubt having to rescued him on the night he came from hell. Dr. Broom adopts the boy and they live at the Center For Paranormal Studies in New Jersey with a fish like creature and a fire starter girl who Hellboy loves to pieces.</p></body></html>

Dawn of the Dead made you care about the characters so much, yet Land of the Dead never really makes you love the characters. The main character, Simon Baker, looks good for the part. He does an okay job. His weird sidekick does an okay job as well, yet his part seems unnecessary. Asia Argento seems to try a little too hard to be a tomboy. John Leguizamo does a good job, and he seems to be the only character I cared about by the end. Dennis Hopper does a great job.<br /><br />The script is about all these people living on an island. They try to coexist, yet unfortunately some social unrest makes every angry. John Leguizamo decides to take action, and the rest is the plot of the movie. The weird thing about the script is the fact that the zombies now have the ability to do much more than before. One of the zombies develops the mental capacity to work a gun, much like Bub did in Day of the Dead. That same zombie has the power to lead the people into the city. Other zombies have the power to hide perfectly, and then jump out unexpectedly. You would think that the zombie would just strike when he sees the person, but for some reason they wait.<br /><br />I wouldn't say the movie is great, but it definetly has some fun parts. The violence is brutal in the uncut version. It is by far the most brutal yet. People's corpses get mangled into pieces, and it happens often. If you can handle it, it's good.</p></body></html>

Definitely recommended!<br /><br />In 2006, the seventh Disney/Pixar film "Cars" was released in theaters.  Needless to say, the film was a major hit as it was nominated for two Academy Awards, has made over $461 million worldwide.<br /><br />In fact, the film was so popular that merchandise is still sold in department stores today and the cars have been popular toys that have made over $5 billion in sales.<br /><br />Needless to say, "Cars" was not just a box office success, it is one of Disney/Pixars biggest money making titles that is loved by critics and fans that easily ensured a sequel for a planned release in 2011.<br /><br />In 2009, in time for the holidays is the release of "Cars - Ultimate Cars Gift Pack" which is a great release for those who have now jumped aboard in purchasing a Blu-ray player and a Blu-ray which was released in 2007 and has received nothing but magnificent reviews.<br /><br />"Cars" is a film directed by John Lasseter ("Toy Story" films, "A Bug's Life") and co-directed by Joseph Ranft ("Monsters, Inc.", "Finding Nemo", "A Bug's Life", "The Incredibles") and features a screenplay by Lasster, Ranft, Dan Fogelman ("Bolt", "The 12th Man"), Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin and Jorgen Klubein ("A Bug's Life", "Mulan", "Pocohontaas", "The Lion King").<br /><br />The film revolves around a popular rookie named Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson, "Bottle Rocket", "Marley & Me") who races in the Piston Cup stock car racing competition.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen is quite arrogant and not much of a team-player.  He doesn't trust his pit crew and sure enough, when he gets into a 3-car tie, the race would be determined a week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway.<br /><br />While on the road to practice in California, he pushes his big rig Mack to travel all early morning but when a group of cars start becoming reckless around Mack, Lightning McQueen rolls out of the back of the big rig and ends up in the countryside.<br /><br />When Lightning McQueen goes to find Mack, he ends up in a small town of Radiator Springs.

But also Lightning  possibly discovering  love.<br /><br />"Cars" is an exciting, hilarious and well-cast film featuring beautiful animation from Pixar and looks and sounds incredible via HD on Blu-ray!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Cars" on Blu-ray is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1) and the picture quality of the film is absolutely vibrant.  Colors are absolutely beautiful as you can see the nice sheen of the cars and the reflections of the cars.  You can see the detail on the rust stains on Mater and for the most part, if you put in your DVD, you can see how much of a difference the film looks in HD via Blu-ray over its DVD counterpart.  Vibrant colors, more detail and overall, a beautiful video transfer with no blemishes, compression artifacts whatsoever.<br /><br />Audio is presented in English 5.1 (uncompressed, 48 kHz/24-Bit) and the racing segments really utilize the surround channels but also the LFE.  It's one thing to have the nice clear dialogue and music through the front and center channels but to hear the cars speeding on the raceway and zooming and hearing through the surrounds is fantastic.  Crashes bring out the booms and the audience on the race track can be heard on the surround channels. Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the DVD is featured in widescreen (2:39:1) and is enhanced for 16?9 televisions.

The picture and audio quality of "Cars" in High Definition is still magnificent but of course since the original Blu-ray was released in 2007, the lossless audio soundtrack is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) instead of the current 5.1 or 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack that Pixar films are offered in today's Blu-ray releases.  But still, it's uncompressed audio and the lossless audio soundtrack of this Blu-ray release is still fantastic.  And of course, picture quality is still outstanding.<br /><br />As for the "Ultimate Cars Gift Pack", the release is right on time for the holidays.  With many people now moving to Blu-ray and many Disney/Pixar fans knowing that "Cars" is one of those must-have films to own, Disney is offering a gift pack that includes a DVD (which is great for the kids during long commutes) and two exclusive cars with custom Ransburg paint.<br /><br />Really, there's nothing negative that can be said about "Cars - Ultimate Cars Gift Pack".  If you have know someone who is new to Blu-ray and is a Disney/Pixar fan, this is a wonderful holiday gift to give.  It's a high quality release that is definitely recommended!</p></body></html>

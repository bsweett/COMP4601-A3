Jennifer Garner has perfected her role that she has reprised once again since her last film `Daredevil'. I couldn't picture anyone else as this character after watching this movie, she truly is amazing. This has it all action with cool special effects and a good story. From the animals coming off of Tattoo to just the martial arts battles, this really did impress me. Like everyone has said, you shouldn't judge this movie until you see it. It is very underrated and also very good.</p></body></html>

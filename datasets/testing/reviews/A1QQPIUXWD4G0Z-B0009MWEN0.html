<meta name="summary" content="Some Of The Very Best Special Effects Ever Presented!"></head><body><p>A science-fiction pulp satire based on Robert Heinlein's (author of Farenheit 451)novel of the same title. Director Paul Verhoeven and writer Ed Neumeier present their own satirical version of the novel with spectacular and extremely graphic special effects.<br /><br />The Earth is under the governance of a fascist state in which citizenship is conditional upon proper military service: commonly accepted rights are reduced to privileges granted on the condition that one perform state-mandated duties.  Several young friends soon join the ranks to fight a mysterious race of gigantic insects who are assaulting the planet.  The new cadets join the space fleet to attack the giant pests on their home planet of Klandathau but things don't go as planned: the critters are smarter than anyone thought and put up a stiff resistance.<br /><br />The film is presented in a rather comical/cartoonish manner to emphasize the satirical themes.  Although the acting is somewhat weak with perhaps the exception of Michael Ironside as the hardened sergeant, it's the special effects that are the prize of the film.  These are truly some of the most impressive CGI effects ever presented and there's no shortage of blood and guts.  For this reason, I would not recommend this film for young children or disturbed adolescents.  The gore in this film is the most graphic I've ever seen and I'm certainly not shy to violence in films.<br /><br />A great satire/sci-fi/action film with great effects and a good plot.  Definitely a film you can enjoy over and over again.</p></body></html>

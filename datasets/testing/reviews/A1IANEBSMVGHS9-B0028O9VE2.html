It's more of a James L. Brooks movie. Once again, he writes, directs and produces, as he did with the classic "Terms of Endearment" back in 1983, and more recently, with "As Good as It Gets".<br /><br />Sandler plays John Clasky, a renowned chef who is in the prime of his professional career. He's the classic "good guy", who loves his family and keeps a great balance between the time he devotes to work and the time with his kids. Plus he loves his insecure wife Deborah, played by Tea Leoni (Deep Impact, The Family Man), one wacky lady who has put her career on hold to raise her family.<br /><br />Complementing the cast is Paz Vega, who broke into international stardom playing Lucia in "Sex and Lucia". She plays Flor (with rolled "R" at the end), a protective Mexican mom who wants to stay as close as possible to her native Mexican values, even while living in the heart of L.A., cleaning and cooking for the Clasky family.<br /><br />While the plot does lead into some predictable events (don't mean to spoil the story for you), this is not your "typical" Adam Sandler movie. As a matter of fact, some of the most hilarious moments are not courtesy of the legend from "The Wedding Singer" and Saturday Night Live, but rather the result of the head-on encounter of two cultures, where no side can speak the other's language or easily understand each other's motivations.<br /><br />With a balance between humor and drama that is preserved throughout most of the plot, the movie stands a good chance of being almost as popular as "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" was a back in 2002.</p></body></html>

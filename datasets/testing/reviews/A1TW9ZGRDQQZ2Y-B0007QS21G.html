In truth, all the SFX you see on the previews are what you see when watching the movie. The only difference being you have to sit through a long....two hours of horrendously written mumbo-jumbo talk and bad acting (people in the theater were actually laughing at the actors everytime they said something stupid, which was practically in every scene). The only reason for two stars is that the effects are pretty good and look epic on the big screen. If I were you I would wait to rent this on Dvd. I'm not usually harsh on movies and rarely give them lower than three stars, but this no-brain stinker deserves it.</p></body></html>

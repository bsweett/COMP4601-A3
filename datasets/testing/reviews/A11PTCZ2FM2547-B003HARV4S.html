<meta name="summary" content="Stunning. . .Superb"></head><body><p>From the opening credits to the soft visuals of the closing scene--all of it augmented wonderfully by Philip Glass's haunting score--THE ILLUSIONIST serves notice it is a film that truly demonstrates the art of entertainment.  Beautiful, enchanting cinematography; a dynamic, gifted cast; exceptional music; a compelling story--all of these components mesh and blend to create a spellbinding (pardon the pun) viewing experience.<br /><br />Edward Norton has never been better; he captures the mystery, the power, the allure, of Eisenheim the Illusionist.  Yet Norton appears in roughly half the film; Paul Giamatti carries the other half as Inspector Uhl, a man torn between his loyalty to his superiors--and his desire to know the truth.  I thought Giamatti was at the pinnacle of his talents in "Cinderalla Man," but I was wrong.  The actor is in rarefied air in this role.  Rufus Sewell is deliciously evil as Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel is a more than worthy love interest for both the Prince and Eisenheim.<br /><br />I won't belabor the plot, as it's been regurgitated ad infinitum in previous reviews, but I am running out of superlatives.  If you're contemplating purchasing this DVD, I would recommend you do so, as it's worth every penny.  Few movies are visual and artistic treasures; this is one of them.  THE ILLUSIONIST will be a movie you'll want to watch, again and again.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON</p></body></html>

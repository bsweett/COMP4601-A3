<meta name="summary" content="I love this movie, i've been converted!!"></head><body><p>I hated the first movie a blazing pasion serpassed only by my hate of the new "Star Wars" films. I have to tell you I thought this movie kicked total ...!! From the first moment a failed assination attempt on the president to the goverment takeover of the mutant school.  Thats just the begining the action in this flick takes hold and it doesn't let go untill the movie stops.  <p>A few points <p>The Bad <p>A. Don't take your young kids to see this there are several scary parts that are sure to have them screaming(at least that was the case for the kds in my theater)<p>B. Sorry Cyclops fans out there he really doesn' thave much of a role in this one. <p>C. It seemed at times that this movie didn't know what it was trying to achomplish. It has somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 writters and it really shows when all is said and done. <p>The Good <p>NIGHTCRAWLER-My god this guy is cool!!<br />Pyro:-Great balls of fire!!<p>General Stricker(Brian Cox) Man talk about a creepy villian this guy is great!<p>Magneto: Friend or Foe? You decide <p>Overall-Excellent just great forget X1 and get this on video when it comes out</p></body></html>

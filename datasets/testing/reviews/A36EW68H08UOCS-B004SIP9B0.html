Her small nuances and gestures and even her walk easily evoke Her Majesty - the one in my public mind.  As the film progresses we're privy to behind locked door scenes that are only the speculation of Director Stephen Frears and Alan Morgan - but they fit in perfectly with what we think we know about the house of Mountbatten-Windsor.  In the emotional final act, Dame Mirren's performance becomes even more remarkable as she gives us a brief glimpse into the humanity of the woman never seen by the public eye.<br /><br />Michael Sheen gives an equally impressive supporting performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair, who as the film opens has just been elected from the Labor Party in a landslide after eighteen years of Conservatives. (Blair's predecessors John Major and Margaret Thatcher aren't mentioned.) The Queen and her advisors are in preparation for Mr. Blair's promise to shake things up when tragedy strikes.<br /><br />For those too young to remember the effect that the unexpected death of Lady Diana had on the world - "Princess Di" married Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and future King of England, while she was a teenager and Charles was in his thirties.  The Prince has a reputation for being very properly British - stiff upper lip and all that - and somewhat detached from the "real world" while Diana hung out with rock stars and made conspicuous public appearances that made her maybe the world's most famous celebrity.  They were married fifteen years, had two sons, and divorced a year before her death in Paris - her car speeding in a narrow tunnel, trying to flee paparazzi.  For the twelve-year old reader: if Anna Nicole had intelligence, charm, character, and had devoted years of her life to world-wide charitable causes like the fight against AIDS and land-mines, after being married to the future King of England, well... you get the idea.<br /><br />Anyway - back to the film.  Diana and Charles have been divorced for a year, and when she is killed she is no longer "Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales".  In addition, the media attention around Diana and her split from Charles has not been flattering to the Royals.  When Elizabeth is told that Diana's family, the Spencers, want to have a private funeral, the Queen is satisfied with that.  She doesn't want a big "to-do" and, after all, it's what her family wanted.  A recurrent theme in the film is how badly the Queen and her advisors initially underestimate the national and world-wide outpouring of grief over Diana's tragic death.<br /><br />The royal family is on holiday at the massive estate at Balmoral.  While the Queen is away the flag doesn't fly over Buckingham Palace.  But mourners are lining up outside the Palace and leaving flowers and keep-sakes outside the royal gates and Prime Minister Blair correctly senses that the British people think that the Queen and her family should return to London and fly the flag at half-mast.<br /><br />Elizabeth worked for the British Military transportation during World War II and when her father died and she became Queen in 1952, her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill.  Her Majesty is "old school", and she knows protocol.  Her subjects are demanding a degree of Royal respect and honor which she knows that she would not receive if she were to die herself.  She wants to shield her grandsons from the brouhaha in London - it's bad enough that they've lost their mother, isn't it?<br /><br />James Cromwell gives a great performance as the Queen's husband, Prince Phillip, and Sylvia Syms gets many of the best lines as the Queen Mother. Alex Jennings looks a little bit like Prince Charles - from behind - and he gives a good performance that shows that Charles had strong feelings for Diana a year after their divorce.<br /><br />The best scenes take place between the Prime Minister and Her Majesty - some of them phone conversations.  A subtle, but plainly growing, degree of respect develops between the two of them as they both realize that the other is behaving in a way that is perfectly understandable.  Mr. Blair realizes that the Queen is a product of her upbringing and experience and that she has always behaved in the best interests of her country, while Elizabeth realizes that Mr. Blair is being both respectful of the crown while having his finger on the pulse of her subjects.<br /><br />Doesn't everyone wonder what the real Queen (and others behind the gates of Buckingham Palace) think of this film?  I think they wouldn't be disappointed.  The Mrs. and I give two thumbs up.</p></body></html>

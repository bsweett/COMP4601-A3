<meta name="summary" content="What's Harder? Disarming a Bomb or Picking Out a Box of Cereal?"></head><body><p>Let's see...first you take a few character actors and put them in lead roles. Then you take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q8GKLM">Lord Voldemort</a> and put him in a character actor's role. Put the last director that you'd ever think of in charge. And what do you get? In my opinion? You get The Hurt Locker. You get the movie that deserves the Best Picture nod in 2010.<br /><br />Was Director Kathryn Bigalow in Iraq? I have no idea. But she made me believe that I was looking into Iraq at the daily routines of a squad charged with the task of investigating and disarming IEDs (improvised explosive devices).<br /><br />I've heard that the movie has been criticized by war veterans and others actually in Iraq for inaccurately portraying wartime conditions, but this all seemed very real to me. Sure, it seemed like the cast was under fire and constantly dealing with some IED threat, and maybe that's what the critics are referring to. But it's a movie. Liberties were taken to consolidate a term in Iraq into 2 hours.<br /><br />I have to say that I was captivated and on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Action. Camaraderie. Emotion. Excellent story. Great script. Great acting. All from an improbable director whose last memorable movie--albeit another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MOWP0">classic</a>--was almost 20 years ago.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is certainly one of the best movies that I've seen in the past year. But I also thought that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVCFK6">Star Trek</a> was too, and that's not up for Best Picture...shallow dogs that Academy.<br /><br />Add The Hurt Locker to your cart. Put it on your shelf right in between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48UO">Full Metal Jacket</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00129H7VS">Band of Brothers</a>.</p></body></html>

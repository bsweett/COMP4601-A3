<meta name="summary" content="MATADOR GORED BY WIMPY ENDING"></head><body><p>MATADOR was going along very well and then just seemed to die. It is as if the script writer or writers just couldn't figure out how to end this movie. Even as a parody of a movie about a hit man (Pierce Brosnan), it has one of the wimpiest endings I've seen. Until the last half hour, however, we have here a pretty good film. Mr. Brosnan plays a zany contract killer and his effort in MATADOR reminds me of George Clooney's off-the-wall performance in O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? The same focus on odd hair, loony smile and absurd speechifying. It is a terrific performance by Brosnan, who adopts a regular citizen (Greg Kinnear) as his friend and brings him into his sinister world. This is a kind of buddy flick with women playing peripheral roles. MATADOR has slick production values and is quite entertaining. Until the last half hour, that is. One will need to overlook some ideas about contract killing that might disturb if taken out from the dark of the theater and examined in the light of morality.</p></body></html>

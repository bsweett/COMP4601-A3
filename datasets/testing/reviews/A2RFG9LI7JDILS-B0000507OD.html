Like Breathless, Kane instigated a revolution in film style that all subsequent film releases are greatly indebted to. I prefer Welles' 'Touch of Evil' to this one - but as far as originality and breathtakeing visual talent are concerned - Kane is right at the top.  Welles was uncompromising - and thank god for that!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not a great film, but very good. And fun."></head><body><p>Director Peter Berg has crafted a well-paced action movie. Some clever choices, such as the "player stats" in the opening sequence, and some quick edits make the movie interesting to watch.<p>The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) becomes a movie star here. While his last effort, "The Scorpion King," suffered from a rehashed script, he stood out. This time, the script is ever-so-slightly better. But the charisma that Johnson brings to the role of Beck is what makes it work. He's obviously been working on his acting skills as well.<p>Christopher Walken makes the most of his latest bad guy role. He's played it a hundred times before, but he's always interesting to watch. As is Rosario Dawson, though she seems to have a little trouble keeping her accent in tact throughout the movie.<p>Overall, it's a fine summer movie that just got released in September instead of June. Unfortunately, they have replaced the great theatrical poster with some b-movie cover art for the DVD.</p></body></html>

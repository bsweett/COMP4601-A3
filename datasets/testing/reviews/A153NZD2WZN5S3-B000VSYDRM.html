<meta name="summary" content="The story of mankind"></head><body><p>Unwanted hatred offspring was born in a rubbish disposary and abandoned even before a first breath.<br /><br />Hatred and humiliated by all a growing man had been surrounded by, he developed an indefinite urge for tender and love on a very personal simply biological level not nurtured even with a shadow of community-bounded restrictions a middle-ages society imposed on then living.<br /><br />Short of education, his obsession and a craft only is making perfumes, based on his very natural superficial capabilities of memorizing the smells and imagine pure physical outcomes from the mixtures of chemicals. By a such extraordinary way he assumes people around and his rather investigatory-out-of-this-world imagination stipulates him pursuing females of whom necessary component extractions had been released.<br /><br />Knowing no boundaries in his unstoppable quest for these rather witchery activities, a young man not only converted his execution in a mass orgy but made himself an object of an indefinite sexual attraction, which act had ended his human existence.<br /><br />Although this movie might for instance be lined up with "Interview with Vampire", "The Queen of Damned " and, to some extend, "The Brothers Grimm", its deep philosophical meaning could hardly gratify a broad majority of cinema-goers.<br /><br />Personally, I would return to this brilliant work in some time later.</p></body></html>

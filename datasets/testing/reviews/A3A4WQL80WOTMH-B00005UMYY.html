I tried, but this is a boring excercise in trying to figure out what's going on in a story that starts at the end and brings you back to "what happened" by taking back to the beginning scene by scene in reverse order.  If those scenes had been intereting in themselves maybe I'd have stuck it out, but for the hour that I sat through, this movie was a big yawner.</p></body></html>

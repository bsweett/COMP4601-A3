<meta name="summary" content="Saw 2 is a very suspensful sequel"></head><body><p>I really liked this sequel. I normally like sequels of movies that I liked and this one is exceptional. It holds alot more suspense than the first one because there is a more complicated trap for people to get out of. In this Saw, it takes alot more brains to figure out how to get out. In a way, it reminded me of Cube with the complexity of figuring out the puzzle. Pick up this sequel and you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend this to any horror fan!!!!</p></body></html>

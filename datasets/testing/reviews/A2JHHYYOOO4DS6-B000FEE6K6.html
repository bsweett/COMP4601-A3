Here the movie shows us how the "arms dealing" involves the politician, suburbian housewife, immigrants and poor youths living in developing countries. We get to see who does most of the work, who benefits and the danger it involves for those at the less powerful end of the equation. I can't quite call this entertainment....nothing to laugh about here. The five stars are for the acting (Nicolas Cage rocks) and the story telling.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Tops"></head><body><p>Quite simply one of the best films ever made, and now its available on a proper DVD (i.e. not double sided).<br />Based on the true story of Henry Hill it covers his life as gangster from young lad to middle-age. The film has everything, the script and direction are perfect and the performances from the cast are outstanding. For a film that 2 hours and 19 mins long, not a moment is wasted.<br />Scorcese peaked with this film and although he has made worthy and noteable films since, none match this one. Scene after memorable scene occurs, the killing in the bar, entering the nightclub (the famous long shot) and perhaps best of all the 'funny guy' scene.<br />Scorcese frequently refereneces other films and I wonder if the scene where Henry attacks the guy with the butt of his gun is a direct reference to The Godfather when Sonny beats up his sisters boyfriend.<br />In an interview Scorcese said that at the end of the 80's there were a lot of films coming out with fast cutting, and this film was his response "you wanna it fast - lets make it really fast". Nowhere is this felt more than near the end when the pace of the film reflects Henrys high on cocaine.<br />The extras on the special edition are pretty good, but you shouldn't be buying this film for the extras. Go treat yourself, a film like this doesn't happen very often and its an essential purchase.</p></body></html>

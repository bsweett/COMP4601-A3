<meta name="summary" content="Not simply messing about in boats"></head><body><p>An essential movie for the collection of any fan of things nautical, Peter Weir and the cast deliver an unforgettable sea-faring saga, fraught with danger, and brim full of human interest.<br /><br />The sound effects are spectacular, especially with the benefit of surround sound.  My living room reverberated to the hammering of the nine and eighteen pounders, and every creak of the masts, every flap of the sail, every sour note from Captain Aubrey's violin could be clearly heard. I could almost smell the salty air, as my other senses awakened to smell, taste and touch what my eyes and ears were already experiencing.  Even my sixth sense perked up for a few hours.<br /><br />The battle scenes are vividly enacted, and the cinematography is excellent.  The scene where the ship is becalmed is hauntingly beautiful, making any further explanation superfluous.<br /><br />Russell Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey as a fearless, intelligent and compassionate man, stubbornly loyal and prepared to risk everything to carry out his orders.  He knows every member of his crew, takes the time to teach young midshipmen naval procedure, and enjoys musical interludes with his friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  However, when the opportunity arises to combat the elusive French warship "Acheron", he almost loses both his ship and his friendship, and pays a bitter price for his ambition.<br /><br />The captain of the "Acheron" plagues him incessantly, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting him in battle, and Capt. Aubrey has to resort to cunning and disguise to narrow the odds and turn the tide of the battle.<br /><br />A well told story, but drawn out with a few overly dramatic scenes that could have been more comfortable on the cutting room floor.  It also helps to know your nautical terms, which Capt. Aubrey rattles off at top speed, so if you don't know your port from your starboard or your Nautica from your Sperry, you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 28, 2004</p></body></html>

This is how the story goes: Former government operative Bryan Mills begins the longest 96-hours of his life--and the hunt for the fearsome organization that has taken his daughter Kim. Mills had only recently given up his government career as what he calls a 'preventer' to be near Kim, who lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore and her new husband. To make ends meet, Bryan joins some former colleagues for special security details (like guarding a pop diva), but most of his time and energy are spent re-connecting with Kim. Bryan's familial goal is nearly derailed when Kim requests his permission to spend time in Paris with a friend. All too aware of the dangers that could lie ahead for Kim in a foreign land, Bryan says no, but Kim's disappointment leads him to very reluctantly relent. Bryan's worst fears are realized when Kim and her friend Amanda are suddenly abducted--in broad daylight--from the Paris apartment at which they've just arrived. Moments before Kim is dragged away by the as yet unseen and unknown assailants, she manages to phone Bryan, who begins to expertly piece together clues that will take him to the darkness of Paris' underworld, and to the City of Lights' plushest mansions. He will face nightmares worse than anything he experienced in black ops--and let nothing and no one stop him from saving his daughter.<br /><br />The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Bryan) is great! The directing by Pierre Morel (who also directed "District 13" (2004) & the upcoming "From Paris With Love" (2009) is great! The story and screenplay by Luc Besson (who also produced) (who also produced the upcoming "From Paris With Love") & Robert Mark Kamen (both who also wrote the stories and screenplays to "The Transporter 1, 2, & 3" (2002, 2005, & 2008), also co-wrote the screenplay to "The Fifth Element" (1997, with Besson, who also directed), also co-wrote the screenplay to "Kiss Of The Dragon" (2001, with Besson, who also produced) is great!<br /><br />The music by Nathaniel Mechaly is great! The cinematography by Michel Abramowicz (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming "From Paris With Love") is great! The film editing by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Thoraval (who also did the film editing to "District 13", "Angel-A" (2005, which Besson also wrote, produced, and directed), & the upcoming "From Paris With Love") is great! The casting by Ferne Cassel (who also did the casting to "Monster" (2003) & Nathalie Cheron (who also did the casting to "The Transporter") is great! The production design by Hugues Tissandier (who also did the production design to "The Messenger: The Story Of Joan Of Arc" (1999, which Besson also directed, co-wrote the screenplay, and co-produced), "The Transporter", "District 13", "Arthur And The Invisibles" (2007, which Besson directed co-wrote the screenplay, and produced), "District 13 - Ultimatum" (2009, which Besson also produced and wrote the screenplay), & the upcoming "Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard" (2009) & "Arthur And The Two Worlds War" (2010, both which Besson directed, produced, and co-wrote the screenplays) is great! The art direction by Gilles Boillot (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard" & "Arthur And The Two Worlds War" (both which Besson directed, produced, and co-wrote the screenplays) & Nanci Roberts is great! The costume design by Olivier B&eacute;riot (who also did the costume design to "Unleashed" (2005, which Besson also produced and wrote), "Arthur And The Invisibles", the upcoming "Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard" & "Arthur And The Two Worlds War", & "The Transporter 3") is great!<br /><br />This is an great action-thriller that keeps you thinking and your heart racing. This is an excellent role for Liam Neeson. One of Luc Besson's best movies of his career, produced and story wise. This is one of the best action films of the new year.</p></body></html>

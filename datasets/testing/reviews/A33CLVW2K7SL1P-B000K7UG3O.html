<meta name="summary" content="To Save a Mockingbird"></head><body><p>Imagine my surprise when, about two-thirds of the way through Failure to Launch, I realized that my favorite scenes were those that didn't involve Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker (Tripp and Paula), the stars of the film. That doesn't mean that I wish an entire film had been made only of the costars, but only that I was less than enthused with the main story line.<br /><br />That's not a good thing.<br /><br />The premise is a flimsy one. Tripp is thirty-five, and still lives with his parents, Sue and Al, played well by Kathy Bates and a game Terry Bradshaw. Sue and Al fraternize with three other couples whose sons, preposterously, also live at home. That is, until one of those couples found Paula, a so-called professional interventionist, and paid her to charm their son and through a series of steps (none of which made much sense to me) Paula was able to get him to move out. Sue and Al fall for this crackpot gimmick, and hire Paula.<br /><br />Paula, we can tell, is doing well for herself. She lives in what looks like a large house with one roommate, and they both like to drink champagne - not just any, they drink non-vintage Bollinger. It's not the cheapest, and not the most expensive, but definitely well above the average person's "every-day champagne". (It retails for between $34.99 a bottle and $45.99.) The roommate (Kit, played beautifully by Zooey Deschanel) is obsessed with a mockingbird that won't stop singing outside of her window. This provides an interesting side-story, and definitely the biggest laughs.<br /><br />Tripp's two best friends also live with their parents, so Paula, it should seem, would be hard pressed for her plans to work with Tripp, but she doesn't seem to think so (nor do the filmmakers), so she moves forward with her multi-stepped plan. One part of her plan is to share an emotional moment, and on what seems like the third day of knowing him, she calls him, crying hysterically. She's at the vet, and claims that the dog on the table in front of them is her dog, and it's being put to sleep. Her performance is, I suppose, believable. Tripp thinks so. But here's my problem: what girl/guy would want to drag a guy/girl that they very much want to bond with into such a dramatic experience right away? Nobody wants to appear overemotional or needy, and that's exactly what Paula is risking. And that's a huge risk! But, it works. It shouldn't have, though. The Tripp we've been introduced to would have seen that as too much.<br /><br />It's all too much, really, and if not for her friend with the mockingbird, this movie wouldn't fare so well. But the mockingbird scene was funny, and the supporting cast gets good marks for being a bit more interesting than those they were supposed to support.<br /><br />So, 2? rounded up to three for the supporting cast (and the mockingbird).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EXTREMELY POWERFUL AND EYE OPENING MOVIE"></head><body><p>BASED ON A TRUE STORY, THIS HIGHLY MEMORABLE MOVIE IS ABOUT PAUL RUSESABAGINA [DON CHEADLE, GIVING A TRULY POWERFUL PERFORMANCE] WHO MUST FIND A WAY TO SAVE OVER 1,000 RWANDAN GUESTS FROM BEING KILLED DURING A CLASH BETWEEN THE TUTSIS AND THE HUTUS. EXTREMELY WELL PLOTTED, ACTING IS REALLY GOOD, AND THE MOVIE IS SO MESMERIZING THAT IT'S HARD TO EVEN TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE SCREEN ONCE YOU GET INTO IT!! IF YOU WANNA SEE A REAL MOVIE THAT ACTUALLY IS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT NEVER GETS BORING, BUY THIS MOVIE. THIS IS FAR TOO GOOD TO JUST RENT. THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY WORTH OWNING.</p></body></html>

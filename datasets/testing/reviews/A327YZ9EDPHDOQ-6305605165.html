I just received my copy of "It's A Wonderful Life". Several years ago about every t.v. station aired this classic. That is until NBC snatched up the exclusive rights to the Jimmy Stewart film about this hero down on his luck until his meeting with Clarence. Donna Reed did an excellent job in her role. I may sound prejudice but she is one of tbe best and she was from my home state of Iowa!!!!  It's A Wonderful Life..even though it was panned by the critics and was not one of the big box office hits of 1946,the movie has stood the test of time ever since for a new generation to enjoy. And always remember...every time a bell rings an angel earns his or her wings!!</p></body></html>

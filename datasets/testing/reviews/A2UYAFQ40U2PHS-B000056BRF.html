<meta name="summary" content="One of the best examples of Old Hollywood craftmanship..."></head><body><p>This is a spectacular edition of 2 of the greatest epics that Hollywood produced.  They can serve as a reminder that not everything Hollywood put out was garbage, and that remakes can be better if they can improve on the original.  The 1925 version is spectacular enough, costing an unprecedented 4 million at the time, and while not as good as the 1959 version, it's worth seeing and it's one of the best examples of silent film.  The 1959 version is brilliant.  Despite the film being almost 4 hours, it is never boring, even after the chariot race (contrary to rumour, the film doesn't end with the chariot race).  The narrative arc of the story is so well done that it more than keeps your interest.  Charlton Heston won an Oscar for his excellent performance, and Stephen Boyd and Jack Hawkins are superlative as well.  The chariot race is amazing to watch.  It goes on for quite some time, and there is not one word of dialogue spoken throughout it.  Today, Heston and Boyd would be makin' snarky wisecracks at each other, and it would all be CGI.  Knowing that the chariots, horses, racetrack, and actors are all real, makes this sequence even more gripping.  Word to current filmmakers.  The 1959 version of Ben-Hur is why you should remake something.  First, the new version is in colour, it has sound, and it's shot in widescreen.  These are great improvements over the 1925 version.  There was a real valid reason to remake it (screw that "reimagning" rubbish), instead of a bald faced attempt to make money.  Cecil B. DeMille was originally scheduled to direct this, but died before any pre-production work started.  It was taken over by William Wyler, one of Hollywood's neglected directors.  This film was shot in 2.75:1, the widest aspect ratio ever used.  Only a handful of films were shot that way (The Greatest Story Ever Told was a notable one).  It's truly spectacular, one of those brilliant epics that the old studio system cranked out quite prolifically.</p></body></html>

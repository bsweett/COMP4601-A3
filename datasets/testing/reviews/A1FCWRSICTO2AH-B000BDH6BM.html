<meta name="summary" content="Revenge flick with heart"></head><body><p>If you like revenge flicks, "Four Brothers" is a pretty good one.  The story line however is a bit different, not following any pre-set revenge flick formula.  The Mercer brothers - foster brothers in fact- return home to bury their sainted foster mother Evelyn Mercer (played by Fionnula Flanagan).  And Evelyn's boys, who have been for the most channeled into productive lives through her efforts, certainly are familiar with the code of the street.  Once Evelyn's buried, it's time for an eye for an eye - and then some.  I know, this sounds formula like, but it isn't.  What distinguishes this movie is how director Singleton give all the characters dimension and depth, but in such a way that never strips the move of it's shoot-em-up nature.  Make no mistake, this is an extremely violent movie, but at its heart it teaches, without preaching, mutual love and respect for family.  Given the vehicle, a revenge flick, this is a really hard to thing to pull off, with most directors just increasing the body count and bullets to compensate.  But Singleton succeeds brilliantly.  In particular, I was impressed by what must be one of Wahlberg's best performances.  Too often lately he's been packaged as some sort of super cool Steve McQueen type, a really icy dude. In contrast, "Four Brothers" taps into Wahlberg's inner thug, seeing at last the fire and passion that you sensed was always there, but had been kept largely under wraps.  Well, as it says on the tattoo on his back: "No Mercy" (This is for you Mom).  This is a B flick, but one with a heart of gold that nevertheless refuses to compromise its street sense.  Good stuff!</p></body></html>

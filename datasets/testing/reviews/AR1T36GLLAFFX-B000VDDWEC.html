<meta name="summary" content="Ground-breaking 'zombie-like' movie"></head><body><p>I guess I would have considered this a 'zombie' movie, since the bad guys are not at all nice, and have definite problems (to say the least).  But it isn't a zombie movie, since zombies are the dead, come back to life.  The vicious killers in this excellent film are actually living, breathing, normal folks who happen to get rapidly infected with the 'Rage virus'.<br /><br />I say that 28 Days Later is a ground-breaking film because it is such a departure from the 'Night of the Living Dead'-type of film, where the zombies are slow-moving, but relentless creatures with a taste for human flesh.  In 28 Days, the unfriendlies are angry, very angry, and they act out their most violet impulses on any human within grabbing distance.  These guys are FAST and terribly violent, and if you get a drop of blood in your eye, or in a cut, or breath in the virus particles, it's pretty much all over.  (Pretty much?  No, it's really ALL OVER, and you are going to act like Jack the Ripper on a very bad day.  28 Days is a smartly done thriller with tremendous tension that keeps your heart pounding the whole movie.<br /><br />The film is well photographed and the Rage Victims are truly terrifying.  The don't shuffle along at a speed a snail could outrun, but the are fast and lightning-quick.  And they have one desire...to kill you.<br /><br />(Of course no virus will take over your brain in, like, 10 seconds.  They need to replicate many generations to do their damage.  That's why you don't get a cold instantly when someone sneezes in your face.  Oh, by the way, make sure the sneezer doesn't have...the Rage Virus!)<br /><br />The cinematography in this film is excellent.  It gives the film-goer a sense of loneliness, fear, affection, struggle and eventual survival (for some of the characters).  I suppose the only criticism would be that the virus can infect a person in 10-15 seconds, which is impossible.  But it does make it handy to tell if someone is infected.  If they go crazy and try to kill you, they are infected!<br /><br />Highly recommended.  But be forewarned, this is often very bloody, very gruesome, and very graphic. This one will bear repeat viewing.  It's a must see.</p></body></html>

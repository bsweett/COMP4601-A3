<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest epics of all time"></head><body><p>Ok, I must admit. I'm a sucker for epics. I love their scope, their feel, the time they take to go over all the details of their subjects' lives. A good epic immerses you into their world. It's good to get lost in an epic, and I got lost in Lawrence of Arabia.<p>Telling the story of T.E. Lawrence in his attempt to bring the feuding clans of Arabs together during the World War II, this film is beautiful in its leisure ness, exciting in its action, and absolutely breathtaking in its cinematography. At the time of its release, it had to be the most beautiful filmed motion picture ever made.<p>Fresh from his success in the film Bridge on the River Kwai, director David Lean sought to make a film of equal greatness. Instead he surpassed it. For any film buffs, Lawrence of Arabia is a must have for their collection. Its influence in modern filmmakers alone is amazing, Steven Spielberg in particular. The wonder Spielberg saw in this film is evident in his own filmography; from the desert scapes in his Indiana Jones films to the intimacy of Schindler's List.<p>Fantastic performances by a young Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness and the rest of the cast bring the story to vivid life. In particular, O'Toole becomes Lawrence. It's clear the actors believed in their characters, and in the movie.<p>Filled with classic moments that still to this day inspire awe and power in its audiences, such as the slow approach by stranger on horseback to the well Lawrence and his companion drink from, this film is fantastic on all levels. A must-see, must-own for any lover of film.</p></body></html>

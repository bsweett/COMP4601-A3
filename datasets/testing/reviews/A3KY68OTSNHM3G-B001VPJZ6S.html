This movie focuses on five high school students who are to spend a Saturday in detention for whatever it was that they did wrong.  At the beginning of the day, they didn't even know each other's names, but by the end, they had bared their souls, explained their dreams, and became friends.<br /><br />Judd Nelson (Bender), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Molly Ringwald (Claire) and Ally Sheedy (Allison) star as the students, while Paul Gleason stars as principal Richard Vernon.  At 7 am, the students enter the library, not knowing each other, but as the movie progresses, they learn more and more about each other so that by the end of the day, they all realize that there is a little bit of everyone in each of them.  Bender is the "criminal", suffering from a bad homelife, abusive parents, and a lack of self-esteem.  Brian is the "brain", who believes in studying hard and getting good grades, but he's also a geek.  Andrew is the "jock".  He is frustrated because he feels that he must live up to his father's high expectations for him.  He snaps under the pressure that his father placed on him.  Claire is the "princess".  She feels that she's better than everyone, and has the best of everything.  Allison is the "basket case".  Like Bender, she is suffering from low self-esteem, so she lies to cover up her insecurities.<br /><br />It is amazing to watch the transformation of these characters, especially the relationship between Claire and Bender.  Although he constantly harasses her throughout the movie, deep down Bender really likes and cares for Claire.  As the movie progresses, the characters soon realize that they all have a little of the same characteristics of each other, such as the scene where they are running from Vernon in the halls and Bender asks Claire how it feels to be bad.  Then they display some of Bender's characteristics by sitting and smoking marajuana.<br /><br />There are several funny points in the film as well, such as Bender crashing through the ceiling while telling a joke, and the constant harassment that Vernon faced.  Also, who can forget the great song by Simple Minds?<br /><br />This is a great movie.  The story is excellent and well-developed.  The acting is first-rate, but I thought that Judd Nelson did an especially good job as Bender.  I give this movie a very high recommendation.  To the outside world they were simply the jock, the criminal, the princess, the brain, and the basket case, but to each other, they would always be the breakfast club.</p></body></html>

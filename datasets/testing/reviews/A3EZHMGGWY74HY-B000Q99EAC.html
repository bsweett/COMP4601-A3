This film was a wonderful tribute to Rocky's humble beginnings.  I loved the music, seeing all the old places again...it brought me back to when I first saw Rocky as a little girl.  Try this one, even if you have your doubts.  You won't be disappointed.  The only sad thing about the movie was that Adrian was gone, but even that added something special to the nostalgic look back at where Rocky began.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This was pretty disappointing."></head><body><p>Like many of the other reviewers, I am a longtime fan of George Romero's zombie flicks... I first saw "Night Of The Living Dead" in 1975, and have been a devoted enthusiast ever since.  I think the sequels are good, too, and each followed up on the subversive political satire of the original.<br /><br />However, I also have to count myself among those who found this fourth Romero flick to be a bit, well, "dead."  I really wanted to like it, and rented it despite the numerous well-reasoned, well-balanced reviews by other Amazon customers who panned it...  Sadly, it's true: the script is weak, the action is flat, and the theme -- that the zombies, having proved capable of learning and adaptive behavior in the previous film, are now able to organize themselves as a coherent social force -- isn't explored in a terribly interesting way.  Much of the dramatic heft is given over to two terrible hams, Dennis Hopper and John Leguziamo, and although the "good" good guys have some likeable characters, there's still not much in the way of compelling character development.  Perhaps in another five years Romero will come back yet again with a film in which the zombies have established a new civilzation and become a political force to be reckoned with, and that could be a cool story... But Romero might do well to hire an outside writer (Joss Whedon, perhaps?) who could bring a little more life into the series.  This film was the first real dud.</p></body></html>

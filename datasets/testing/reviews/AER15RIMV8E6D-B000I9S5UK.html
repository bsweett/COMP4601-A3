<meta name="summary" content="An Action-Packed Remake!!!"></head><body><p>I think I like this version better than the original! It has more action, it's New Year's Eve, it's snowing! At a rundown precinct, four prisoners are dropped because of weather conditions, after the New Year's ball drops, the sh#t hits the fan. Crooked cops are coming to kill Bishop, a cop-killer. The crooked cops will kill anyone who gets in their way. The good cops must receive help from the prisoners if they want to make it out alive! If you love action, you'll love ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13!!!</p></body></html>

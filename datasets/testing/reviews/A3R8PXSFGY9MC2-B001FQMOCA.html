<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Film"></head><body><p>This is quite simply a brilliant film, with superb performances by Phoenix and Wetherspoon. I knew nothing about Johnny Cash before this film, but feel I've come away with some understanding of the man as well as a real appreciation of his music. This follows his life up until he married June Carter and explores his childhood, first marriage, rise to the top of the music industry and his struggles with drug abuse. The music is great and makes for an excellent introduction to Johnny Cash's work. This film kept me interested the whole way through, and left me wanting to find out more. This is also well worth a viewing even if you know nothing of Cash or aren't a big fan of country music, it can be watched as a human interest story in it's own right, but you will leave it captivated by the man. Simply excellent!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

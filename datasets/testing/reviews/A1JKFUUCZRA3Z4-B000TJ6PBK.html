<meta name="summary" content="Good, but could've been so much better"></head><body><p>This movie starts out slowly with me wondering how the opening shots would tie in with the rest of the movie (they do, but later on).  There's an effectively suspenseful intro into room 1408 with Samuel L Jackson giving stern warnings about entering that room.  Apparently, anyone who enters that room commits suicide, even if they're only there a few minutes.<br />When Mike Enslin (John Cusack) actually does enter the room, the movie picks up steam...turning into a kind of Ghost Hunters t.v. show on crack.<br /><br />However, although there's a creepy vibe and your typical scare tactics, it seemed like this story was going to take a more meaningful turn.  The ghosts and demons that visit Mike are actually ghosts and demons from his painful past.  I even shed a tear, which is an unexpected response for a thriller.  So instead of being like a Ghost Hunters episode, it seemed like it'd be more like a Twilight Zone episode, with a meaningful plot twist at the end.<br /><br />I thought perhaps there'd be a message about letting go of your past or about resisting the temptation to escape, either by drinking or committing suicide.  But instead, the movie ends with a cheap scare.  That's disappointing because it had potential to go much farther than it actually did.</p></body></html>

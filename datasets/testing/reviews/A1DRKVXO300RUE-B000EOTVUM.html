The movie is an enjoyable story as a group of friends travel through some remote areas, then find themselves in an unimaginably bad situation.  I'm starting to enjoy these types of films less - torture, kidnapping, etc.  This one is no exception though, as the torture is palpably real and particularly brutal.  That said, it is very well done, and I can enjoy just watching the first half, and content myself with knowing that the ending isn't so good for the cast.</p></body></html>

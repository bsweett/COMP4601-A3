The film is based upon a novel by Cormac McCarthy.  It's a Coen brothers' picture, meaning that Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, directed, edited, and co-produced the picture.  The cast is composed of mostly talented, though underrated actors, including Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones.  I realize that many times movies with similar credentials have been complete flops.  Thankfully, that isn't the case with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.<br /><br />The Coens return to the type of filmmaking, like that of BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, that gave them a following.  The film revolves around three very distinct and different characters.  First there is Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) an everyman slacker. Despite his lack of ambition, his wife loves him and they have a good relationship. Llewellyn stumbles upon what appears to have been a shootout over a drug deal gone bad amidst a circle of vehicles in the back country.  Slaughtered bodies lie scattered across the field.  Llewellyn locates the apparent "survivor" of the massacre who lies dead beneath a tree along with a briefcase full of money.  Llewellyn gives in to the temptation and takes the money, thereby placing himself on the top of the list of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a murderous psychopath who sometimes decides the fate of his victims with the flip of a coin.<br /><br />Chigurh is the second focal character in the film.  Chigurh is another symbolic character that seems to represent everything that has gone wrong with the U.S.  He is a murderer and stops at nothing to get his way.  Yet, there is an almost twisted logic to some of his actions.  He never contradicts the coin he carries--it is his lord.  He also never breaks a promise; a trait that would be a good thing in most people, but a trait that becomes horrifying in psychopathic murderer.  Chigurh chases Llewellyn across the country with a ruthless abandon.  Along the way, Chigurh settles the score with other men that have crossed his path before.<br /><br />The final focal character is sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  Bell is on the verge of retirement.  His father was a lawman as was his father before him.  The world has changed dramatically since Bell was a young officer.  Violent crime and illegal drugs coming across the border are common occurrences.  Bell feels that he is the last of dying breed; the last of an old tradition. He has the nose of a detective and is chasing Chigurh and trying to catch the demon before he causes anymore violence, but he always seems to be just one step behind.  He doesn't realize it at the time, but his hunt to capture Chigurh is the last of his career before he retires to live in a place that truly is "no country for old men."<br /><br />I really enjoyed NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  The movie is serious, but has comical moments that relieve the tension.  The cinematography and settings are almost majestic in their simplicity and barrenness.  The acting is top of the line and Bardem, Brolin, and Jones each give great performances.  Even though there are no car chases, super powers, sword fights, or pirates, the film kept me on the edge of my seat as I tried to guess what was going to happen next, root for Llewellyn Moss to escape, and hope that Ed Tom Bell would meet Chigurh in a final showdown.<br /><br />I realize that even though I liked the film, there are many who won't.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a dark and depressing picture.  It offers no solace, no comfort, very little joy, and paints a picture of the future as being almost hopeless.  It also doesn't have a nice, tight ending.  I liked the film as a work of film, but when I left the theatre after seeing the movie for the first time, I was so saddened by what I had seen that I cried for a few minutes in my car.  Very few dark films have touched me like that.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2007.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys well-crafted movies.</p></body></html>

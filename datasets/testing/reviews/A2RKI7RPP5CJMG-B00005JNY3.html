What it is, however, is a wonderful mystery tale laced with superstition, that grand Southern culture, and a refreshingly surprising ending.  The story starts out in New Orleans where Caroline(Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker who's grown tired of the "business" of helping people die a nice and easy death.  She takes a job deep in the bayous of Terrebonne Parish at a home where an elderly man, John Hurt, and his wife, Gena Rowlands, live together.  Hurt's character has supposedly suffered a stroke, and Hudson is hired to help him down that last highway in life.<br /><br />Things start to get peculiar when Hudson opens up a room in the attic with her skeleton key.  In it, she is introduced to the sometimes spooky, sometimes bizarre world of hoodoo.  As the rest of the story unfolds, Hudson starts to think that Hurt is actually under some sort of curse and wants her to help him escape his mute and aging prison.<br /><br />I have to admit that the twisted conclusion of this flick caught me by surprise.  Early revelations in the film become clear and, to a degree, very morbid.  There isn't a lot of "BOO!" scares in this flick, nor is there any gore(excepting a little bit of blood and a couple of broken legs).  This flick is simply a good little horror tale that doesn't end up with a bunch of sex-crazed teens getting hacked up or a couple of Asian ghosts making creepy noises.<br /><br />The location helps the story role along rather well.  Being from Louisiana, I've been in a few spots in the woods near my home that just naturally give off an uneasy feeling.  Throw in the hoodoo aspect, and you make the atmosphere that much creepier.<br /><br />Perhaps it deserves three-and-a-half stars more than four, but it is much better than the bulk of the so-called horror flicks these days.</p></body></html>

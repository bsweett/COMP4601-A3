<meta name="summary" content="A Strong Entry To The Jason Saga..."></head><body><p>While FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 2 left some to be desired, the ending to that movie was satisfying and ultimately led us into this third and impressive entry into the popular horror series. While the intro credits score was a little cheesy, the movie itself is anything but that. Thanks to a better cast, a biker gang, and a little more believable hormone-driven agenda, this entry is worthwhile for all fans of the series. While no longer presented in 3-D on DVD (the 3-d was cool), you can still feel hints of that technology in some of the movies scenes featuring Jason's weapons of choice.<br /><br />Once again, Camp Crystal Lake is open for business and another population of sex-inspired teens are on duty for more. Not only that, but we also have a biker gang that adds more to the movie than just the counselors...now anyone can go if Jason don't like you...and he doesn't. He wastes no time in dispatching away one counselor or biker after the other (the biker that got the pitchfork got the worst of it, ouch!). This is also the first movie where Jason finally dons the hockey mask, which is now a most sought after costume accessory where I'm from. There are many good scenes in the movie, especially where poor Jason is hanging and then finally gets free...there's just no way to stop him, he seems to be invincible. The ending, of course, leaves the movie open for what would be one of the most superior of the series, THE FINAL CHAPTER.<br /><br />But while you sift through the series, don't skip over this little goody. This a landmark in the series as it shows the first scenes of Jason in his official mask. FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 3 is a must-see for anyone who wants to see where Jason "officially" came to life. You've been warned...</p></body></html>

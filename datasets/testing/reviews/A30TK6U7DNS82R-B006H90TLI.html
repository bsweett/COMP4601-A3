<meta name="summary" content="Best Terminator Movie since the Original"></head><body><p>I've read that they are trying to land Christian Bale for the starring part in the upcoming TERMINATOR SALVATION, but someone tell the producers to line up Javier Bardem, Spain's most popular star, to play his robotic unstoppable super-rival.  This is the best Terminator picture since the original one.  By far!  Bardem does things with an air gun that you never saw Schwarzenegger even try to attempt.  We saw this movie over the Thanksgiving holiday with a friend, and all of us were sitting gripping the arms of our chairs white-knuckled, so tensed up with suspense we were hyperventilating.<br /><br />I liked Javier Bardem when he played Cuban in BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, the Reinaldo Arenas story, but here he plays a man called Anton Chigurh (Josh Brolin twitches when he hears the name, snorts "Sugar?" as though to underscore how evil a man could have so sweet a name), who is charged with getting back $2 million dollars in drug money.  Josh stumbles onto this cache of money, packed neatly into a highly distinctive portfolio bag, whilst out deer hunting on a lazy day somewhere on the Texas Mexico border.  Not far away, Tommy Lee Jones as the state's most seen it all sheriff contemplates happy retirement with Tess Harper, both of them made up to show they've spent too much time in the sun.  The movie's set in 1980, not too long ago on the calendar, but let's face it, any movie set in the past before cell phones and the internet is going to seem like it's from the distant Old West past.  When a motel has a sign, "Free HBO," or another character refers to an ATM, at first you think it's some sort of anachronism, like seeing that wristwatch on Moses' wrist in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, then you stop and think, well maybe they did have HBO and ATMs back in 1980 but otherwise, you're just left wondering why did they bother trying to situate the story back 27 years?  It would have played just as well in today's era, or slightly in the future like the other Terminator movies.  Maybe this one is like a prequel of sorts, only it's not an origin story, instead Chigurh seems fully formed and totally evil from the very first time he ambles onto the screen, in his moptop Beatles haircut and dragging that oxygen tank.  He doesn't say much, but what he says is packed full of contempt for human nature, as befits his slightly monstrous physical makeup.  The Coen Brothers, whose dialogue is often self-reflexive to the point of being goofy, here play it down a bit and keep it on the level of the famous "Hasta la vista, baby" quips Arnold fired off in parts 1 and 2.<br /><br />I didn't really understand why they (or author Cormac McCarthy called it NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but apparently it comes from Yeats' poem "Sailing to Byzantium," which became early on a rallying cry for the cyborg movement with its repeated please to leave the human behind and move into a post-human re-mix.  "Once out of nature I shall never take/ My bodily form from any natural thing."<br /><br />Some of the action setpieces here rival the ones James Cameron dreamed up for the original movies.  The very first one, even before Javier Bardem shows up, has Josh Brolin catapulting down a rocksliding hill and slamming belly first into a quickmoving river while a feral dog races after him only a nip away from his butt the whole time.  Ferocious action filmmaking at its finest.  My favorite part was on line waiting for tickets for the show and the guy in front of me asked for two for "No Country Music for Old Men."  Oh brother, where art thou?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Pretty Good Romantic Comedy!!!"></head><body><p>I have been away for a while because we were without electricity for 10 days! We needed to go to my  aunt and uncle's house in Paducah to keep warm and we decided to watch this move. Anyway...<br /><br />Will Smith does an awesome job as playing a Love Doctor named Alex "Hitch" Hitchens who tries to help a dorky client who has fallen in love with a rich celebrity named Allegra Cole. Meanwhile, Hitch has fallen in love also. If you love Will Smith and romantic comedies, you'll love HITCH!!!<br /><br />p.s. My aunt and uncle are awesome!!!</p></body></html>

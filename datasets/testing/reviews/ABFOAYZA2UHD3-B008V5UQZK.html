<meta name="summary" content="it has a few problems to it.."></head><body><p>I cannot fathom why Nia Vardalos insisted on playing Toula, her acting is mediocre at best and actually diminishes the believability of the story.<br /><br />There are also a number of exaggerations in the whole "crazy greek family" setup, eeeeeveryone in her family is so crazy and tacky, and only SHE, brought up by same people mind you, is a model of style and taste.<br /><br />She is embarassed by her family yet has no balls to live a life on her own, without them.. what the hell?!<br /><br />First time you watch this movie, it's funny, as all the exaggerations actually surprise you and make you laugh, but on second viewing it starts sucking.. Too bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rocking the Amazon Like He Always Does: Above Average Action"></head><body><p>&quot;Rundown&quot; is a surprisingly good action film, perhaps better than &quot;The Scorpion King,&quot; starring The Rock, whose mustles and humors will always entertain you.  Slick, funny, and most of all bone-crunching, this is what a good action flick should be.<p>The Rock is &quot;Beck&quot; who wants to own an Italian restaurant (seriouly, and he is a cook), but now has to work as a &quot;retrieval expert&quot; for a mobster.  Now he is assigned another job, hopefully the last one, of bringing back the gangster's son Travis (Seann William Scott) from the Amazon, where he is seeking for a treasure somewhere in the jungle.<p>The Rock flies there; among the beautiful rain forests, he finds Travis, who is not happy to meet him.  To make things more complicated, greedy baddie Hatcher (Christopher Walken with his usual quirky mannerism), the king of &quot;El Dolado,&quot; a goldmine where the natives are forced to work for criminaly low wages, steps in, to require the secrets of the treasure Travis is after. <p>Against the backdrop of the green jungles, the great actions go on with the Rock in top form.  One of the unique points is that he refuses to use guns, relying on his physical agility and strength, and it works nicely in each moment.  The gravity-defying stunts of the Rock are all well-choreographed, without using too much wire-works.  They are exciting and funny, the best kind of actions coming from Hollywood.<p>Rosalio Dawson and Ewen Bremner appear as support, and they are good.  But the real scene-stealer is Christopher Walken, who can infuse slight touch of comic (perhaps without his knowing) into the simplest word like &quot;wow.&quot;  Actually, he is the kind of the villain whose first appearance on the screen would make you cheer and applause eben if you know that he is a villain.  That is something you are not going to see in Hollywood films everyday.<p>The fascinating jungle location (of Hawaii, in fact) works well as a bonus point to &quot;Rundown,&quot; great action film.  And don't miss the cameo of Arnie whose short line is very meaningful.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3rd Installment Not So Dazzling"></head><body><p>I thoroughly enjoyed watching the 1st two installments of the Ocean's film series, but not this one so much. I felt like there were some good moments in this film, but felt it paled in comparison to both Ocean's 11 & 12.<br /><br />The overall plot for Ocean's 13 lacked a lot of the appeal, cohesiveness, tightly written plot twists and turns, and so on that made Ocean's 11 & 12 great, engaging movies to watch from start to finish.</p></body></html>

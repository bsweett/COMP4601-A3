<meta name="summary" content="gritty look at high school football"></head><body><p>I thought this movie reflects in some way, the best and the worst of high school football have to offered. Its a very gritty look of the town, its people and how they played the game of football through their kids. It also a look of how these kids pursued their dreams of glory regardless of the cost. The movie centered around few characters from the team, to its coach, his quarterback, fumble inclined back up running back to a cocky superb running back who was injured.<br /><br />The movie have been watered down quite a bit from the book which must have angered the people of Odessa, Texas to no end when it was first published. I thought the feel was very authentic and it was successful in showing the rest of the world how seriously some people take high school football. (Probably no more then how many people in other parts of the world take soccer so seriously or in Japan where high school baseball take on mythical level.)<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton did an excellent job portarying the head coach, Gary Grimes. In fact, he have been watered down from the book version pretty considerably. Lucus Black playes Boobie Miles very well. Of course, this is not exactly a very likable character in the beginning. Shallow, uneducated braggart who represent all that was wrong with star high school football player who only think football. Many in the audience reacted to his injury on the field with certain satisfaction. But ironically, Miles character developed into something truly worthy after he realized that his playing time was over and it was interesting to see this shallow braggart developed into a whole human being.<br /><br />I initially thought that this was another "Hoosier" type of movie but I was mistaken. The movie tries to do many things on different levels but overall, it was an indellible movie about kids in sports.</p></body></html>

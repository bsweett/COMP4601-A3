James MacAvoy as the protagonist Nicholas starts as an idealistic doctor aiming to help treat villagers.  Through happenstance, he becomes acquainted with Amin and is bit by bit drawn into his spider web.<br /><br />Making small concessions at first, Nicholas realizes he is compromised ethically and becomes desperate for a way out of Amin's coterie and a way out of Uganda.  His problems extend to the fact that he cannot "keep it in his pants," and he has an affair with one of Amin's wives, who he impregnates.  Not a smart move and perhaps indicative of a death wish.  Will he survive?  Will he be able to leave Uganda?<br /><br />A suspenseful film based on true life events in Africa.</p></body></html>

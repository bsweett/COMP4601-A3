<meta name="summary" content="Hanks' performance almost makes this a great movie"></head><body><p>&quot;Cast Away&quot; is, if nothing else, an example of how one great performance can almost lift a so-so film. In this case, the great performance is turned in by Tom Hanks, and it's a dandy. <p>Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express employee who's obsessed with time. We inhabit Noland's go-go world for a time, starting with one terrific sequence in which he's trying to sell Russians on the virtues of being on time - no mean feat with Russians. <p>We meet his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), a sweet woman who has to compete with Noland's job for affection (she gives him a conductor's pocket watch for Christmas, and he says he'll always keep it on home time).<p>All of this changes when Noland hops a Federal Express plane for a business trip to the South Pacific. The flight gets lost, then the plane is forced to ditch in the Pacific. After fighting to escape the burning, sinking plane, and struggling to survive in typhoon-racked seas, Noland finds himself stranded on a deserted, hardscrapple island. He instinctively reaches for his pager...and it's dead.<p>Suddenly, the man who is ruled by the clock has nothing but time. Hanks' transformation from helpless castaway to hardened survivor (and back to a civilized man after he's rescued) is alternately funny, sad, triumphant, and downbeat. He can say more with a facial expression, or body movement, than most actors can with brilliant dialogue.<p>The sequences in which Hanks tries to survive on the desert island are by far the strongest pieces of &quot;Cast Away,&quot; and taken alone, they're brilliant. Unfortunately, the bookends of the castaway story - the time before Noland is stranded and after he is rescued - don't even begin to approach the power of the island sequences. <p>For starters, once Noland's rescued, he wants above all to see his old girlfriend; unfortunately, in the intervening years, she has written him off for dead (as she should have), and she's married with kids. Director Robert Zemeckis - no stranger to schmaltzy relationships - toys with the audience briefly by suggesting they might get back together, but the mere idea of it is beyond silly, and thankfully, it's never consummated. The two characters are not the same two people who existed before Nolan was lost, after all. <p>But the mere idea of these two reuniting is so silly to begin with that Zemeckis is foolish for even entertaining it. Better to have cut that one off at the root, and had Noland start his journey of rediscovery. I also wish that Hunt would have been given more of a character to work with; she's basically stuck in a &quot;loving housewife&quot; mode, but we don't know what makes her tick, and I didn't see many sparks between her and Hanks.<p>Like all Zemeckis' movies, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is technically brilliant, but the island sequences challenge Zemeckis' usual hyperactive visual style; after all, how do you do &quot;Back To The Future&quot; camera moves on a desert island? Zemeckis compensates by adding other sensory stimulation - namely, sound - to the largely static camera shots to give us a kinetic sense of place. <p>Overall, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is very much worth seeing, if for nothing else than Hanks' brilliant performance and the raw power of the desert island scenes. It's too bad that these pieces didn't make a better whole.</p></body></html>

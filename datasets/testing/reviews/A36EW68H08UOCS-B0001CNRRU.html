The movie is not told in a straightforward fashion.  There are approximately 40-50 scenes, and they are assembled in a non-linear fashion.  It's sort of the cinematic equivalent of tossing 50 pieces of a puzzle onto a table and having to mentally assemble them.<br /><br />For me, it works.  I have read other reviews that weren't that crazy about it.  Roger Ebert wrote that the technique got in the way of the story.  Other reviewers here have complained either that it made the story "slow" or boring or that they just didn't get it.<br /><br />I'd have to see the whole film reassembled into chronological order to be able to give an opinion about whether or not the film is better in its presented form or whether it would be improved by being more conventional, but I didn't have any trouble sorting out the various plot-lines in my head as the story unfolded.<br /><br />Sean Penn gives another memorable performance as a math professor with a congenitally bad heart.  We learn that he is less than a month from death unless he gets a transplant.  Naomi Watts gives the best performance I've seen yet from this talented actress as a woman who is happily married to an architect with whom she shares two daughters, but we also see that in her past she did more than dabble in drugs.  Benicio Del Toro is heartbreakingly good as a man who has lived a hard life and done some hard time before being saved, in the Christian sense. Melissa Leo is his wife, and she shared his hard life before, and plainly hasn't come to terms yet with his conversion as a born-again Christian.  All of the main characters intersect in ways that I cannot reveal without spoiling, so I won't.<br /><br />There are many other supporting performances given by actors who I was not familiar with, and my lack of recognition contributed to my ability to fall into the story.  The film brings up many difficult questions, and I think it is one of it's strengths that it does not find easy answers to them.<br /><br />It's a worthwhile way to spend 2 hours if you want to see strong acting, bravura film-making, and don't mind having to think about what's on the screen.</p></body></html>

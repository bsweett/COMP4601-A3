<meta name="summary" content="Unremarkable sequel"></head><body><p>The first Final Destination movie was something of a low budget success story, with a host of mostly unknown actors, and contained some interesting and thrilling elements. This sequel however just reworks old ground, and the lack of surprises make it rather ordinary viewing. The premise for both movies is the same in that when it's your time to die, if you somehow "cheat" death, it stalks you in an unseen malevolent form until your number is up. The first 15 minutes of this picture portrays a horrific multiple car accident on the freeway in very graphic and gripping fashion, and promises much in the way of tension and intrigue, as our young heroin Kimberly (played by A J Cook)witnesses the events in a premonition, and prevents a handful of characters from a scheduled date with the Grim Reaper. Too many references to the previous film ensue, and the sole survivor we are told from the last story appears briefly in cameo, to help our troubled band in their quest for survival. After the opening eye candy the movie rapidly spirals into a formula driven sequence of mini subplots concerning each character, but doesn't hold the viewer enough to make you really care about what's going on. Doing a sequel is always difficult, but when one thinks about those that are succesful, they usually have a storyline independent to their predessessor, whereas this is virtually a carbon copy with just the names and locations changed. This is an OK flick, but not much more - there are a few scary moments, and the picture will probably appeal to the 18-25 demographic, who are represented in character throughout the movie. Not bad, but not as good as the first, and too few surprises to really make it work well.</p></body></html>

Sometimes. Other times they looked like PS1 graphics.<br /><br />The costumes and set design were so cheesy and the acting was pretty bad. Especially the villains who ham it up every step of the way. And the actors were all wrong for their roles. None of them looked the part. Especially the lead who looked like he should be standing outside an Abercrombie and Fitch store in the mall.<br /><br />And a lot of scenes seemed very...umm...Brokeback Dragon to me. Especially one scene with the main character and his cousin!  Those were the only interesting parts. The rest had me falling asleep.<br /><br />There are supposed to be two more of these movies?? I hope they get a better director and script writer.</p></body></html>

The action parts were, however, really good and plentiful.  The storyline was a bit all over the place for me to really sit there and find any solid enjoyment out of it.  Yet somehow, despite the unrealistic story, something about it kept me tuned in.  It must have been all the gun shooting action.  Maybe I'm getting soft at my old age, or maybe there really was something special about the movie.  Worth watching.</p></body></html>

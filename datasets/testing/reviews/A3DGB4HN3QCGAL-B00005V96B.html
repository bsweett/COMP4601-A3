<meta name="summary" content="Something for everyone"></head><body><p>There's a little something for everyone in this movie. It's kind of cartoonish for the little kids (might be just a little scary for some of them), lots of not really violent action, a plot that while silly (monsters scaring kids to capture their screams for use as an energy source) is pretty well done, good characterizations (especially John Goodman as Sulley and Billy Crystal as Mike Wasowski)and some really interesting computer animation.<br />These things alone would make it interesting to watch but if I buy it it'll be for the extras.</p></body></html>

Fortunately, with the high-tech wizardry and Johnny Depp's key performance, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a rich, but darker ride.  Some of the same elements are there, and the development of the story is the same, but this time the atmosphere and the ending are much different.  Both versions have musical numbers, and the story is still basically Dante's 'Inferno' for children (with modern vices and punishments, such as excessive gum chewing or too much TV watching).  The choreography is as dazzling as the first film, but the music is updated enough to feature the Ooompah Loompahs performing rap, techno-pop, and heavy metal to deliver us sermons as well as sweeties.  The children's performances are cardboard caricatures in both movies, but Charlie is younger and maybe even more endearing this time around.  Otherwise, the tone of the factory scenes is much more ominous than the classic made nearly thirty-five years ago.<br /><br />The biggest difference is Johnny Depp.  He is deliberately tentative as the quirky and eccentric Willy Wonka.  His performance is admirable and androgenous, but it purposely leaves out a lot of the charm Gene Wilder provided for the role.  This Wonka seems sheltered and clueless. (Some of the flashback scenes tell more of the story, though.)  Charlie Bucket and family, however, make up for the charm deficit and provide some heart-warming surprises.  (Based on the Roald Dahl novel of the current title.)</p></body></html>

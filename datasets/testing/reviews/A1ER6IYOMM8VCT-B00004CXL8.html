The entire cast is excellent in this well written tale of love that is not so perfect. The movie deals with much more than an impossible romance and is sharp,blunt, and clever in it's execution of many social issues. This movie should be seen by all movie lovers even if you don't like "romantic comedies". The DVD transfer is good and you can find this is the bargain bins for $5.00!.....A bargain indeed!</p></body></html>

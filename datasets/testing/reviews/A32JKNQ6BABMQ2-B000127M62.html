<meta name="summary" content="i thought this one up back in the mid 80s."></head><body><p>this movie was excellent except for 2 very minor flaws.one is for a few minutes at the beginning jason is portrayed as somewhat of a mamas boy and the 2nd one is for about 10 seconds or so freddy intimidates a young girl who looks to be about 7.now i know hes a child murderer but he was never shown going after small children.i dont see anything the least bit entertaining about children in danger.this is definately not for the littleones.it is the last of 8 freddy movies.i think it is a toss up between it and #3 for the best frddy film.freddy exists because people were scared of him.he needed thier fear.the town took all the kids to the loony bin and erased freddy from the records.so he went to hell and pulled out jason to go kill for him.the people would assume it was him and hed be back in buisness.it worked long enough to get freddy back.he got jealous of all the attention jason got and the many many fight were on.in previous freddy and jason films,the deaths were quick,but in this one freddy and jason have epic confrontations.it is an excellent movie but if youre a big fan,youll figure out when and where each combatant is dominant.i think the end was a bit of a bummer too.as for the future?whose to say?jason is supposedto be good for 13 films,but the space one sucked.the freddy's new nightmare kind of blew too.maybe hollywood should qiut screwing around and think about a film people want to watch.the older parts were way better in both sets.</p></body></html>

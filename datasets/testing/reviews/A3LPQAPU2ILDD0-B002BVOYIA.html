Paul Rusesabagina was portrayed to perfection by Don Cheadle, rapidly becoming one of our greatest actors. And almost stealing the attention from him, is the talented Sophie Okonedo, as Tatiana his wife. Both earned well deserved Academy Award nominations. But everything about this film is done to perfection. One of the best arguments against Intolerance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better special effects than the first"></head><body><p>This is apparently the version Sam Raiimis wanted to make but didnt have the money or the experience at the time, hence Part 1.<br />Part 1 is special because it was a film that almost didnt see the light of day. Filmed in 1979 but not released until 1982.<br />This sequel was made in 1987 and has excellent special effects which make Part 1's effects look very amateurish.<br />Die-hard collectors will want all three of the series.  I can't say I am a huge fan but appreciate the origins of this series.</p></body></html>

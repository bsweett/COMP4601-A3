<meta name="summary" content="Did She Have a Son?"></head><body><p>Julianne Moore plays a mother who has lost her child.  He simply perished in a plane crash one day with a number of other children on the way to camp.  Now she is undergoing therapy to deal with her loss.  But soon we begin to wonder if she ever really had a son.  No one else acknowledges that he ever exited.  They all say it is a delusion she created when she had a stillborn child.<br /><br />Julianne refuses to believe the delusion and fights even harder to get her son back.  But her search takes her to another parent who lost a child but he doesn't remember having had a daughter.  Suddenly the Feds show up and the pace of the movie really takes off.  Searching for the truth and avoiding the Feds moves the story forward at an almost breakneck pace until the final revelations and solutions.<br /><br />Although there are some other names in the movie (Gary Sinise and Anthony Edwards), this is almost a one-woman show.  It sort of reminds me of a mother's version of Finding Nemo with the parent doggedly pursuing and facing impossible odds.  There are some aspects to the movie that can keep it from being popular and the original marketing made the movie out to be quite different, but this one is definitely worth taking a look at.</p></body></html>

I thought the original was still marginally better and I of course give that 5 stars out of reverence:)<br /><br />The new movie truly shines in just about every area. The casting is surprising tight, the jarring effects more than accomplish the scares intended, the chemistry is spot on, and the ending is even improved, though to be fair anything different would be an improvement over the originals "Harry" ending.<br /><br />It wasn't without some notable flaws which pulled the score down. First up? The score! This series DEMANDS the originals haunting score, and without, in my opinion, it loses its "Amityness" if just a bit. Another small problem I had was the Jody factor. They seemed to dwell on her a bit too much on the front end making this movie (for a while) seem more like the Jodyville Horror. Taking a page from Jan Brady it would read Jody, Jody, Jody! This was no doubt influenced by the Ring, but I must tell you, she was appropriately frightening so at least it paid off. Lastly, there seemed to be a large hole where the religious aspect used to be. Without Rod Steiger, I'm afraid the priest aspect was a bit of a loss and seemed almost like an afterthought.<br /><br />Still, I left the theater today counting the days until the dvd release and I pray it will be loaded with extras cuz honestly the movie seemed a bit short. If somehow we could fuse the two movies together we have the ultimate weapon because each brings something to the mix that the other doesn't have.</p></body></html>

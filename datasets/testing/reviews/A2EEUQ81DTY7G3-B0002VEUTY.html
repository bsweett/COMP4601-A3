Whatever the case, this viewer was scratching his head in wonderment at how a promisingly successful science fiction franchise could become such a shapeless, uninteresting mess.<br /><br />Pitch Black was a wonderfully original, imaginative and stylish, with the sexy Vin stealing the show with his slick beefiness and polished athleticism. However, there's nothing subtle or stylish about The Chronicles of Riddick: overblown, and bloated with vast, gaudy special effects, costumes and sets, the movie is pretty much a convoluted headache from beginning to end.<br /><br />The movie begins when Riddick (Diesel) is trying to escape from a cold artic-like planet. There's some kind of bounty placed on his head, but he manages to flee in a slick looking spaceship and ends up on New Mecca finding solace with holy man Imam (Keith David). Enter an embarrassed looking Judi Dench, playing a kind of strange and wispy, translucent wind being, who convinces Riddick that he's the only one who can ultimately destroy the Necromancers, an evil army of half human, vampire-like, ghost beings.<br /><br />Suddenly the Necromongers invade and destroy the planet and try to convert the surviving humans, whom they call "breeders" to their religion, which is worshipping something called the "underverse." Riddick is caught by some bounty hunters and sent to a sun-baked planet called Crematora where he rescues Kyra (Alexa Davalos), and some fellow prisoners.<br /><br />Everything is big, cluttered and noisy in this film, from the crab-like industrialized spaceships that spew some kind of black exhaust, to the spectacular skylines of the alien planets, and the metallic goth-like sets, that are obviously modeled on Ancient Egyptian and roman architecture. But the expensive and exciting effects can't make up for the dreadful script and the absolutely atrocious acting from all involved.<br /><br />Perhaps only Thandie Newton rises above the fray - playing with decided camp - a Lady Macbeth-like villainness intent on obtaining absolute power though her Necromancer boyfriend Vaako (Karl Urban). In one unintentionally funny scene, Thandie seductively tongues Vaako all over the face - it's supposed to be erotic, but comes across as quite revolting.<br /><br />Obviously made for fifteen-year-old boys, The Chronicles of Riddick steers clear of any violence or profanity. Most of the action takes place on the prison planet of Crematoria with Riddick spending the majority of the time in bondage, his sweaty arms stretched out in a Crucifixion-like pose. There's lots of fight scenes, which are so badly edited, overly frenetic, and excessively choreographed that they make your head swim; director David Twohy inexplicably shakes his camera around furiously during every fight, rendering much the action completely unwatchable.<br /><br />As Riddick, Vin looks fabulous, but he can't act, and the lines he is forced to spew belittle the seriousness of the story and ultimately make a mockery of his character. One wonders why the fabulous, iconographic Ms. Dench decided to do this film - rumor has it that Judy and Vin are good friends. If this is the case, lets hope that she can finally steer him the direction of better quality material than this, but judging from his career of late, I very seriously doubt this will be the case.

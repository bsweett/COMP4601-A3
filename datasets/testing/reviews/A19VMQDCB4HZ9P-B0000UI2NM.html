<meta name="summary" content="Overall this film was a good action-filled goth-thriller"></head><body><p>Len Wiseman's Underworld has to be taken for what it is: an action film dressed up in goth-couteur with vampires and werewolves. This film doesn't have the scares of other films that include either a vampire or a werewolf or both. It is without any kind of apology a dark, gothic action film.<br /><br />Underworld's story owes alot to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and White Wolf Gaming's Werewolf: Rage and Vampire the Masquerade. Any fans of those two pen-and-paper urban gothic role-playing game would see alot of similarities in Wiseman's film. The film starts off pretty quickly and doesn't really let up until the final scene. There are a few scenes sprinkled throughout the film to let the viewer catch its breath. These scenes would be just as good as the action sequences if not for the scenery-chewing of Shane Brolly's Kraven. Looking like a stereotypical Euro-trash vampire, Brolly's Kraven doesn't know the meaning of understated acting. Some have mentioned that Bill Nighy's vampire elder Viktor does the same, but I thought Nighy's performance was very convincing and very in-character.<br /><br />The person who really holds the film together was Kate Beckinsale. Who knew that she could be convincing as an action-heroine. Her petite form and soft-spoken demeanor actually gives her ass-kicking character some sex-appeal and both fuses well together. It didn't hurt that she pretty much spent almost the entire lenght of the film in some outfit that was all black, and either leather or latex or a combination of both. Ms. Beckinsale is both hot and dangerous in this film.<br /><br />The action sequences owes alot of The Matrix and the other imitators that showed up after the release of that film. Unlike, most Matrix imitators, Underworld doesn't overuse the slo-mo, 360-degree shots that the Wachowski Brothers' film made popular. The FX work for the werewolf change is done well, but sometimes when the Were's arrive on the scene in large groups it still has a certain artificial look to them. But overall, the film's FX work was good enough to avoid scrutiny.<br /><br />Len Wiseman has already announced that Underworld 2 will be made once everyone involved in the first film get their schedules straightened out. The ending of this film really needs a sequel to continue the story that really just started with this film. Underworld is fun and a rollercoaster of a goth-action-thriller.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood Emerges an Undisputed Champ"></head><body><p>This movie absolutly blew me away, the acting is flawless, the story very involving and very unsensationalized in a nonhollywood way. A film of true heart, hope, and tragedy. This film was far better than it's Oscar competition and was the most deserving by a mile. I like this movie better than Mystic River which I also enjoyed immensely. I cannot wait for Eastwood's next film.</p></body></html>

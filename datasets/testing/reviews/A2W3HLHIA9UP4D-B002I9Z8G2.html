<meta name="summary" content="One of the Strongest Films in the series"></head><body><p>Coming off the disappointing film that was "Star Trek Generations", I was hoping that this film would give this series a boost. After viewing, I was thrilled that this film did just that, and then some. I really liked this one, its one of the best in the entire Star Trek film series. Again, the important thing is that the plot to the basic story to the movie is good. The crew has to travel back in time to stop the Borg from assimilating the human race in the past, and make sure that humans make "first contact" with alien lifeforms. Though, the whole time travel thing has been done a lot, when done right, it still works. But I do think that a bit of this story is borrowed from the original Star Trek episode "Assignment: Earth". Again, I'm not a big fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation series, and I'm not too familiar with the cast, but I knew about the Borg storyline from the show. And it really does make for a good motion picture. The film starts quickly and flows nicely. Cast member Johnathan Frakes directs this one, and does a good job. And the acting is as good as you're gonna get in these films. Overall, this one is definitely worth watching and owning. Again, its one of the best in the Star Trek movie series.</p></body></html>

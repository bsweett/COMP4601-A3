<meta name="summary" content="One of the Funniest Films I Have Seen in a Long Time!"></head><body><p>I actually caught myself laughing out loud hard to almost tears several times.  Two divorce attorneys live their fantasy by crashing weddings to get free food and seduce women.  Then at a wedding for a relative of a senator, Owen Wilson meets the woman of his dreams (Rachel McAdams) and Vaughn meets her wild sister who he deflowers.  The girls invite them to stay the weekend at their estate.  The weekend proves to be too much because the longer they are with someone, the more likely their lies will be exposed.<br /><br />Wilson has fallen in love and he needs Vaughn to stay with him to keep up his ruse and win over McAdams who is engaged to an obnoxious and sometimes violent guy.  Vaughn is caught up with wild sex with McAdams sister and advances from her brother and can't take it and tries to leave until Wilson convinces him to stay.<br /><br />When they are found out to be fakes the two are devastated, especially Owen because he is in love with McAdams and is prevented from ever seeing her.<br /><br />Wilson then goes to see the man who invented the wedding crashing idea and made it an art (played by a famous uncredited guest star who virtually steals the rest of the movie).<br /><br />Christopher Walken is great as the girl's senator father and Jane Seymour looks as great as ever as the senator's wife who tries to seduce Owen.</p></body></html>

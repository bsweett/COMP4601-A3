<meta name="summary" content="Lust In Space"></head><body><p>&quot;Lust in space&quot; may have been a better title for this awful movie based on the book by Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein would cringe if he saw this lust story.  Because, thats what is it when you get right down to it: a lust story. There's a catfight between the two women in Johnny Rico's life (although the two girls don't fight each other in the physical sense). One girl wants to get laid by Rico before the other girl does. UGH!</p></body></html>

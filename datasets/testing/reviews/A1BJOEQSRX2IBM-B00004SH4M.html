All the elements are here; beautiful girls, picturesque vistas,  non-stop action, lots of gadgets, memorable villains and more than a  healthy dose of witticisms. Connery was in peak form and had it down cold,  he 'was' Bond and everybody knows he is the best and his first three Bond  films are the best in the series. Filled with many now classic scenes such  as the sight of beautiful Shirley Eaton covered in gold paint on Bond's bed  and Bond tied down to a metal table with a deadly laser pointed right on  his crotch, his most often used asset. Also features two of the series best  villains; greedy Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his henchman Oddjob with  his killer bowler hat. Also with memorable gadgets; Bond's fully loaded  Aston-Martin ranks among the series best and most memorable gadgets. And it  also features Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (!) one of the best of all the  Bond girls. All that and a knockout climax that has Bond fighting Oddjob in  the bowels of Fort Know while handcuffed to an atomic time bomb. A  wonderfully playful score accompanies all the action and a little bit of  cold-war paranoia spread around. A towering achievement that ranks among  the best action films of all time. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  9!</p></body></html>

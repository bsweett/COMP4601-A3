<meta name="summary" content="A thriller that re-defines suspense!"></head><body><p>I had high hopes for this movie.  After all, headlining it were John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet, three actors that I've come to respect and admire.<p>I had high hopes.  And I wasn't disappointed! (It didn't hurt anything that Jake Busey had a role, either...)<p>IDENTITY is a movie unto itself.  It's not the greatest phsycological suspense movie ever made (Hitchock probably had a hand in that movie) but it's pretty damn good.<p>Okay, here's the plot: ten strangers wind up, by chance (or so it seems) at a motel in the middle of nowhere, on a night filled with rain, thunder, lightning, and all the rest of that suspensful stuff.  Among them are: a limo-driver (Cusack) and his employer; a prostitute (Peet) heading home for Florida; a man, his stepchild, and his wife (who's involved in an accident before she reaches the hotel); a young newlywed couple; and a cop (Liotta) escorting an inmate (Busey).  Also thrown into the mix is the manager of the hotel who, while no Bates, possesses an air of innocent mystery.<p>Everything, while not alright, is certainly not dangerous...until the convict escapes, and the killings begin.<p>But there is a question that plagues the occupants of the hotel: is the convict really the killer?  And if not him...then who?<p>Trust me, ladies and gents--despite what you think, you'll not be able to predict the ending of this awesome, creepy, thought-provking, and downright enjoyable movie.  The ending is, indeed, what I would consider to be a classic--I just wish I could tell you more, but I can't.<p>In this movie, no one--and I mean no one, ladies and gents--is who they seem to be.  And that's what makes this movie--much more than a glorified &quot;who-dunit&quot;, in case that's what you were thinking--so suspensful and exciting.<p>IDENTITY is a rarity: a movie for adults (don't go into this expecting a simple, Barney-esque plot) that gives its viewers a childish glee.  A must-see!  I mean it.</p></body></html>

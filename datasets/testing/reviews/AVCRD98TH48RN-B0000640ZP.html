There is even a surprise plot-twist at the end.  The darkly mesmerizing ambience is carefully captured with elegant photography, and all the actors here are notable.  I love seeing a film with great child acting.  The universal child-like fear of the unknown is the central theme throughout, and the two child actors here convey authentic fear.  But the standout performance here is from Nicole Kidman.  This is one of my favorites in her catalog.  There are many films in which she is stoic or comes across as an Ice Queen, fairly reluctant to show her emotional range.  But here she had me interested in her character on an emotional level; and how her character is dealing with the unusual, supernatural circumstances.  Like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; this film will look completely different during the second viewing.  This is a well-acted film with tight direction and a good script.  I was enthralled all the way to the creepy conclusion.  Turn the lights out and enjoy.</p></body></html>

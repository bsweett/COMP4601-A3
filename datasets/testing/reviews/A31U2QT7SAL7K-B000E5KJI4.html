<meta name="summary" content="They DO make 'em like they used to!!!"></head><body><p>It's about time that "the sword and sandal" film make a comeback and what a comeback "Troy" is!!! This is truly a film of grandeur that deserves to be called an epic. Wolfgang Peterson's masterful direction, James Horner's superb score, a very literate script and an outstanding cast, "Troy" takes its place with "Ben-Hur", "Spartacus", and "Gladiator" as one of the best of the genre.<br /><br />For those critical of Pitt's performance as "Achilles", I say that the actor shows that he possesses the acting "muscle" to coincide with the beefed up physique for this challenging role. Eric Bana's is quite sympathetic as "Hector", a prince of Troy forced into battle because of younger brother Paris's (Orlando Bloom) obsession with the beautiful, and very much married, "Helen" of Sparta (the visually-stunning Dianne Kruger).<br /><br />Veterans Peter O'Toole ("King Priam") and Brian Cox (the power-hungry "Agamemnon") are brilliant in their respective roles. Bloom's "Lord of the Rings" co-star Sean Bean is also effective as "Odysseus", brainchild behind the infamous Trojan horse of historical fame.<br /><br />And any movie that features the classy Julie Christie in the small yet memorable role of Pitt's "mom" is destined for greatness.<br /><br />"Troy" may run almost three hours but it's time well spent.<br /><br />I, for one, can't wait for the DVD. I'm sure that any deleted footage will be a treat just like the version currently being seen in cinemas worldwide.</p></body></html>

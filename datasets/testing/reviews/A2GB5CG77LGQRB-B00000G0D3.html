Ben-Hur is one of the most globally acclaimed films of our time, and it won a record-shattering 11 Oscar's! It's hard to fault this classic, and if you have not yet seen it, go and do so now and thank me later.<p>Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) lives as a rich Jewish prince and merchant in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 1st century. Together with the new governor his old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives as commanding officer of the Roman legions. At first they are happy to meet after a long time but their different politic views separate them. During the welcome parade a brick falls down from Judah's house and barely misses the governor. Although Messala knows that they are not guilty he sends Judah to the galleys and throws his mother and sister into prison. But Judah swears to come back and take revenge.<p>Ben-Hur is an endlessly indulgent and involving movie that gets more famous, more brilliant every time you watch it. There is not a fault in the acting: Charlton Heston pulls off a legendary turn as Ben-Hur, winning himself an Oscar, and Stephen Boyd captures the evil nature of his comedy and really makes you hate his character, but not his acting skill. William Wyler's focused direction and Karl Tunberg's script only make it more recommendable, while the thunderous score, delicious set design and breathtaking cinematography make this film non-stop entertaining until the exhilirating last acts.<p>Absorbing, excellent and cinematically brilliant, Ben-Hur is the masterpiece that has changed cinema history forever. It is quite simply one of the finest epic movies that has been bought to our screen.</p></body></html>

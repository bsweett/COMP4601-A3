It's interesting how one's sympathies shift back and forth between the stylish bachelor photographer (Patrick Wilson) and the young girl (Ellen Page of "Juno").  Of course, viewers' sympathies are never totally with the guy, because at best he's someone who forms disturbing and inappropriate associations with young teens.  And, of course, he might be something much worse.  But that's where one's personal politics come into play: even if the guy turns out to be something even more horrific than a seducer of young girls, does that mean that retaliatory teenage vigilantism, complete with mental and physical torture, is still to be condoned?  The generous extra features confirmed my suspicions that the producers wanted to get a dialogue going on the subject rather than make a bold final statement.  Instead, the boldness comes from the almost non-stop intensity that begins almost at the outset. This is one visceral movie.</p></body></html>

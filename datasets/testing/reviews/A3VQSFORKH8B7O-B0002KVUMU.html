The action sequences are breathtaking, and those are the best things about the movie. The story, sad to say, borrows everything from old horror stories like "Dracula," "Frankenstein," "The Wolf Man," and "Jekyll and Hyde." But the plotline is more similar to the many James Bond adventures, especially the fact that Van Helsing (a "Bond-ish" performance by Hugh Jackman) works for a secret agency run by the Vatican assigned to take out monsters, complete with a Q-like Monk named Carl (David Wenham of "Lord of the Rings" fame) and an M-like Cardinal. The cast do what they can in the film, with Kate Beckinsale (be she ever so fine) giving the film's best performance. The story is unoriginal, but when the action sequences occur, "Van Helsing" is one wild ride!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Totally Absorbing"></head><body><p>Total Recall is one of my favorite films of the (early) 90s.  The storyline is dense and the plotting brisk.  Directory Verhoeven again shows his mastery of "hyper realism" where everything seems overdone yet at the same time convincing.  Jost Vacano's photography is crisp with smooth camera moves.  Schwarzenegger gives what I think is his best "acting" role to this day.  <p>This is one of the few sci-fi jobs from the last 15 years that is consistant throughout.  Spielberg should have watched this before he made the disaterous "Minority Report".  Though also based on a Dick story, Recall doesn't fall flat after an hour, nor does it drowned out with endless exposition scenes that seem to plague Minority Report. Verhoeven also resists explaining it all to us at the end, here is where he shows a dicipline with the material that Spielberg lacks.<p>Bravo Arnold, Bravo Verhoeven.</p></body></html>

The first 20 minutes i did not laugh once and wondered what all the fuss was about. The movie was, frankly, plain boring but once we find the guys waking up in their suite the night after, then it starts to rock.<br /><br />There are plenty of great twists even to what you think is a linear plot. Throw in a gratuitous expose breast of Heather Graham, gratuitous Mike Tyson, a tiger, a baby, a missing tooth and stolen police car, and you have a movie.<br /><br />It does fall into that typical Hollywood movie stereotypes. You get the stripper with a heart of gold, the bitchy live-in girlfriend, a Rain Man-like winning streak at the tables and plenty of car crashes.<br /><br />With better film editing this thing could have been off the charts funny. As it is it's a good laugh but nothing like Doug Liman's Go in its ability to capture Vegas today (and even that movie was smart in using Vegas for only a third of its movie).<br /><br />Lastly, there are zero extras on this DVD release. All you get is the wide- and full-screen versions of the movie.</p></body></html>

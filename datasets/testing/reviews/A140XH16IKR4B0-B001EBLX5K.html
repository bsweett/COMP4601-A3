<meta name="summary" content="An intelligent farce"></head><body><p>"Borat" the movie is crude, vulgar, outrageous and offensive. It is also hilarious, biting and a work of satirical brilliance. Surprisingly, it is also good-hearted beneath its boorish exterior.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius -- a man whose exquisitely planned bits of anarchy are strung together with an unexpected intelligence and sophistication. Plots lines interweave and resolve; comic elements are raised several times; characters develop, have conflicts and grow. All this in a film whose main attraction is that it contains scenes shot with unwitting actors. It's like viewing a beautiful watercolor painting, only to learn that it was composed in ten minutes by a man licking the canvas with a tongue colored by popsicles. The sheer talent required makes the feat even more impressive.<br /><br />"Borat" mostly avoids mere gross-out humor in favor of attacks on the pomposity of the upper classes and on and the hyper-politeness and inherent prickliness of many Americans. Cohen continually tests the boundaries of what we will tolerate, delighting in showing us the critical moments when our feelings overcome our breeding. And he loves to show us being as vile and racist as his lead. Hearing a Texan advise Borat to shave his mustache in order to look more Italian (ethnic but acceptable) than Muslim (unacceptably ethnic) was to witness the moronic underbelly of the national racial conversation. Watching a pastor run out when a hooker crashes a dinner party is to underline how far we have come from the One who invited prostitutes into his company.<br /><br />"Borat" is not for everyone. Its vulgarity is pretty extreme, though restrained enough to be believable. Watching Borat and a fat man wrestle in the nude (with sighting of male genitals) is not a sight most would sign up for. Still, it's amazing that even this scene fits in comfortably with the rest of the film. "Borat" surprises by taking its actors seriously while satirizing the rest of the planet's inhabitants. The only distraction was the meddlesome question of how much of the movie was staged, how much was completely acted and how much partially staged.<br /><br />Definitely a movie worth watching for those who appreciate jabs at anti-semites, rich Americans and the occasional swimming bear.</p></body></html>

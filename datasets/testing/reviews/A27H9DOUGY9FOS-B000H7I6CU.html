<meta name="summary" content="Like A Typical Race, A Pleasant "Cars" Follows A Very Routine And Expected Track"></head><body><p>I really wanted to love "Cars"! Trust me, I did. While many think I may be cold and emotionless, I've actually been incredibly impressed by Pixar's track record. "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo," and "The Incredibles" are all film I would have rated among the best in their respective years. And "Toy Story 2" and "Monsters, Inc." are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.<br /><br />But, alas, I was a bit let down with "Cars." It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured. I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family. With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no "real" drama or surprise. Everything proceeds just as you know it will.<br /><br />"Cars" is a great looking movie as you would expect. The visuals are fun and colorful. The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on. Layering in known songs like "Life Is A Highway" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche. The cast is game. Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.<br /><br />Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true. Never once, after viewing "Cars," did I remember it fondly. It was gone just as soon as I'd seen it. Pleasantly entertaining in the now, "Cars" just doesn't have the same enduring appeal as I'd have liked. KGHarris, 11/06.</p></body></html>

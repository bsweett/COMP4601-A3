<meta name="summary" content="Was this Mr. Nice Guy Spielberg...?"></head><body><p>I have to admit, I checked the DVD cover more than once to make sure that this wasn't a film by David Fincher. The nuance and presentation was quite fine, but not as &quot;up&quot; as one would expect from Spielberg (not counting &quot;A.I.&quot;, which was an homage to Kubrick). Regardless, the film is wrought with intrigue not yet imagined, and some great sets. The photography was maybe too &quot;artsy&quot; but was certainly appropriate to the goings-on. The performances were great, with Cruise gaining confidence as the film went on. Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow were customarily fine, and there's a particularly touching performance from Samantha Morton that left me a bit haunted. This film gains momentum, due to excellent editing and very taut direction, as well as a literate script, and the result is an imaginative and exciting adventure, great ecapist fare.</p></body></html>

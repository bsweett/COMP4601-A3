If I had to choose one, I'd have to say I preferred the Alien movies to the Predator.<br /><br />So I was shocked after watching AVP, that I actually found myself sympathising with the Predators!!!<br /><br />There seems to be no relation to the other movies, Sigourney Weaver famously refused to have anything to do with it, so it was left for a below-standard movie to come onto our screens, without any backing from one of the original stars. Surely that's got to be a bad thing?<br /><br />The storyline was a bit iffy, and the characters weren't that particularly likable. They never are in these movies, cos there's more money thrown at the special effects than developing the character storylines. But not to worry, that's the only major letdown, and it's to be expected.<br /><br />What always got me about the Alien movies, and especially the Predator movies, is that you never really saw the aliens/predators that much. In this film, they're shown too much. When they're not shown as much (particularly the Predator, who was mostly invisible in the original movies), it gives the audience a sense of anticipation, of fear etc.<br /><br />For this, like that other 'vs' movie - Freddy vs Jason - there should have been lots of alien vs predator fights. There's barely anything. One at the most. I can understand why some die hard fans were a bit miffed at that. If I'd been a die hard fan, I wouldn't have wanted to watch a few characters run around a pyramid, just asking to be killed.<br /><br />But by the end of the movie, if you don't feel sorry for the Predators (looking bigger, better, and badder than their previous outings), then you have no heart. I actually found myself thinking "awwwwww", without hopefully not giving too much away about the finale.<br /><br />There's already a sequel about to come out in the UK this month, which I'm not sure about. True, the first does just BEG for a sequel, but was it necessary? I'm sure I'll find out soon enough. Personally, they should have either made another Aliens movie (although I think Resurrection was final enough), or made another Predator movie (and brought back Arnie!), and left this well alone.<br /><br />If I do see the sequel, I know who I'm rooting for. Go boy, go!</p></body></html>

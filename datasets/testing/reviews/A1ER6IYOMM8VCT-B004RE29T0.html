<meta name="summary" content="A CLASSIC THAT LOOKS BETTER THAN EVER!"></head><body><p>I saw this film at the theater when it was first released and I have seen it numerous times on TV, but this was the first time I watched the 2 disc special edition(actually the 9 disc box set)in my home theater and I must say I was very impressed! The Transfer is exceptional and the movie has never looked better. There are more than a few good scares in this well made Sci-Fi Horror story and like a low boiling pot the film just slowly intensifies! The acting is also well above average for such Saturday afternoon fare and Weaver is perfectly cast as Ripley. Alien is really a remake of a 50's Sci-Fi film "It The Terror From Beyond Space", but only takes a great idea to another level. The Box set is incredible and a worthy purchase for fans of the series. If you are not a fan of the entire series then buy the two disc set of the first two films. "In Space No One Can Hear You Scream!"</p></body></html>

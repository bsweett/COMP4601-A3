<meta name="summary" content="It Has Action Flicks "Pegg-ed""></head><body><p>The creative forces behind the comedic take on zombie flicks, "Shaun of the Dead," give us their interpretation of "every action movie ever made" with "Hot Fuzz."  Fans of "Dead" will immediately notice headliner Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, a London policeman who's excellence in service forces his superiors to ship him to a small country town in order to protect their own reputations.  "Dead" fans will also recognize his bumbling sidekick played by Nick Frost.  The duo quickly find plenty of trouble in their normally quiet town.  A large number of "accidents" occur that peak the interest of supercop Angel.  As the body count grows, Angel's list of suspects gets even larger.  Who's causing the accidents?  What action film isn't referenced?  It's all here in this superb comedy.<br /><br />Edgar Wright's hard-cutting, musically driven direction style is all over this film.  Once again, fans of "Dead" will pick up on all of Wright's nuances as the story rolls along.  The action is fast, loud, and over-the-top.  It's also pretty gruesome and hilarious at the same time.  Pegg is dead on as Angel.  Despite his small stature you honestly believe that he's the ultimate police officer.  Frost is perfect as the local idiot who only has a job because his dad's the chief inspector.  The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British film.  Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Billie Whitelaw are just a few of the actors you'll find (some with large roles and others with just a blink of the eye's screen time).  Each and every person in this film hams it up perfectly and appears to have had fun with the film.<br /><br />The action sequences are all pretty convincing.  Even the scenes that involve sweet old ladies packing automatic heat on a bicycle come off superbly.<br /><br />The DVD is nice.  The extras are pretty decent, especially the Fuzz-O-Meter and "The Man Who Would Be Fuzz."  Overall, though, I'd buy this disc for the movie and not the extras.<br /><br />If you enjoy spoofs (but not silly ones like "Epic Movie"), check out "Hot Fuzz."  It's a lot smarter and funnier than you'd expect from a spoof.  If you're a fan of "Shaun of the Dead," consider this film already a part of your library.  It's only a matter of time before you buy it.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

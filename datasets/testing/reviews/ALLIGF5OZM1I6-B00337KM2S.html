Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Elliot<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner; based on the novel by Walter Kern<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Jason Reitman<br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Comedy<br />Release Date: 23 December 2009<br /><br />I wouldn't say George Clooney is one of the best actors as far as range is concerned; but he is a long way from the worst and is certainly one of the most likable. Clooney brings his own charisma to the screen that's nothing short of A-list status. It's his unique delivery and charming personality that makes him so enjoyable to watch and there is no shortage of either in the hilarious comedy, Up in the Air.<br /><br />Clooney plays Ryan Bingham; a guy who's more comfortable in a three piece suit than he would be in his pajamas or lounge-wear. He has fired so many people throughout his career that he can't remember the last time he actually hired someone.<br /><br />He is exceptional at this. He's a fire extinguisher to ruckuses and potential lawsuits. His company is so enthralled with his `tact' of letting people go, that they spend a small fortune sending him all over the country to do so, for other companies.<br /><br />It's because of this lifestyle that Ryan prefers being `up in the air' than down on the ground. `Up in the air' meaning the amount of time he spends flying to and from cities to fire people. There are perhaps half a dozen or more additional metaphors to be found in the title; one of the biggest being that his character lives `up in the air' instead of in reality with the rest of us.<br /><br />He has no wife, no kids, no pets and no friends. What little family he has, barely considers him relevant. His home is an absolute joke and is less appealing than the frequent hotels he spends more than two thirds of every year, living in. He has only his career and the occasional one night stand here and there; forming from a few cocktails at whatever hotel's bar he spends his evening at.<br /><br />It's at one of these said locations, that he meets his match, Alex; played delightfully by Vera Farmiga. Thank God someone has finally given her the Oscar nomination she has been so deserving of!<br /><br />Farmiga plays Alex to be every bit as pathetic as Ryan, in reference to their similar tastes and personalities. Naturally, neither of them wants any sort of a commitment. With all of that as un-satisfying as it may sound to the majority - Ryan couldn't be happier.<br /><br />His world is flipped upside down however, when his company grows weary of the financial strain that this brings to them each fiscal year. They hire an uptight young woman straight out of college, with her hair pulled back just a little too tight, to put a new plan in motion.<br /><br />The woman is 23-year-old Natalie Keener, played magnificently by Anna Kendrick. Her plan is to ground the twenty-something employees they fly around excessively to fire people. They will instead, do all of their terminating electronically via web-cam. Sounds thoughtful huh?<br /><br />Ryan is crushed to say the least. We get the sad-puppy-dog-Clooney face that we have all become familiar with, as he sits in his chair barely able to breathe during this little conference. Whatever will he do? What will his life become if he is to be stuck in the same location day in and day out? Ryan can't and won't let that happen.<br /><br />He challenges the youngster in front of their boss, played terrifically by Jason Bateman. Ryan outsmarts her, but in the end is put side by side with her to finish out the last few clients that are to be let go in person. This scene is very smartly written, well acted and hysterical, as was the entire film.<br /><br />In addition to enjoying his job to the fullest extent possible, Ryan's other goal is to reach a certain amount of frequent flyer miles. The number is so disgusting that I won't even share it with you. Should Ryan hit his target number, he will be awarded with a string of nuances, and will be among an elite single digit number of people to have done this, in the world.<br /><br />On their last few firing frenzies together, we learn a lot about Ryan and we learn a lot about Natalie and hopefully a thing or two about ourselves. They help each other with personal problems and character flaws, which are to be expected, but it's never predictable or corny. There are some very nice twists rolled into the second and third acts as well, including a major one, that I never saw coming.<br /><br />The film is full of laugh-out-loud moments that couldn't have been better written. The story moves along at 100 miles an hour and we are never bored even for a second. I've heard some people consider it to be a comedy / drama, and it does contain some dramatic elements; but it's very much a comedy, to me.<br /><br />Clooney definitely has some competition from the other nominees, in regards to taking home the Oscar, but we will see what happens. Up in the Air is well deserving of every single nomination it received and it could easily walk away with several of them.<br /><br />I liked writer / director Jason Reitman's first film Thank You for Smoking, I loved his second film Juno, and this was his best one yet. The man is severely talented and with these three perfect films under his belt, it's safe to say the sky is the limit for him. Don't worry I won't be overly cheesy and say that his success will bring him `Up in the air.' That would be too much.</p></body></html>

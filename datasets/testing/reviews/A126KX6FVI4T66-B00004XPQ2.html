<meta name="summary" content="a deal with the devil to build a bridge"></head><body><p>To the Japanese officer to surrender is to dishonor yourself.<br />So prisoners are treated as the lowest of the low.<br />When an iron willed British officer who was ordered to surrender meets<br />an iron willed Japanese prisoner camp commander, real sparks fly.<br />The compromise that is reached gets the bridge built, but at a cost<br />of a no-win solution,when a British commando team led by an former American prisoner of that camp comes to blow up the bridge.<br />When I first saw this movie I had no idea that the Japanese<br />were even worse than the movie showed them all across Asia.<br />To say that the devil had a good tool in the Japanese Imperial Army is<br />little short of the truth, as Japanese soldiers raped and killed near or above a half million Chinese girls and women during the war.<br />One comes to distrust the Japanese idea of honor and morality when faced with history and factual documentation of their war crimes.<br />This movie if anything soft-pedals their behavior.</p></body></html>

Pilot RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) is the main character who takes charge of a small research group in the Antarctic. When a frozen unknown "THING" is found, the group decides to bring it inside to examine. Naturally it thaws out and comes back to life and all hell breaks loose. When it's discovered that the alien can imitate any living form, the men begin to distrust and suspect each other. In the end, only 2 survive and they're both trying to figure out if the other guy is human or alien. Great supporting cast with Wilford Brimley (yeah, the old "Quaker Oats" guy) as Blair, TK Carter as Nauls, and Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper. Some great scenery including lots of snow and beautiful mountains... and you know it's cold outside from the breath of the actors (although you know it's not 40 degrees below like MacReady states... somehow, if it was, he would have more than an unzipped leather flight jacket on anytime he goes outside). Good special effects for 1982... I have to remind myself - this movie is "decades" old. From the alien spliting open a dog's face (and popping out of the dog), to a crawling head, to a human's chest cavity opening up and biting the Dr's arms off, to the simple few drops of blood jumping out of a pitre dish - it's enough to keep you entertained through the picture. At the time of it's release, I was surprised that the usually safe & secure Kurt Russell would take such a different role in such a different type of movie (Sci-Fi/Horror). Turn the lights off and enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

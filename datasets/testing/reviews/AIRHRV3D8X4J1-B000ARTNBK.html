<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Four was no Spider-Man but is was not a bad movie at all."></head><body><p>I saw Fantastic Four this weekend and I thought it was much better than what some reviewers and critics made it out to be. If your looking for a movie as as good as Spider-Man or even Batman Begins then you will probably not like this movie. Now if your looking for a movie with action and a sense of humor (think Blade Trinity/Ryan Reynolds) then you will probably enjoy the Fantastic Four. Chris Evans who plays Johnny Storm brings some great laughs to this movie. The movie was entertaining and did far better than what anyone expected it to do by being the #1 movie in America opening with 56 million dollars and finally ending a 19 week slump in Hollywood. Fantastic Four is not a great movie but for any marvel comic book fan this is one worth watching.</p></body></html>

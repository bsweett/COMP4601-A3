<meta name="summary" content="Barely Resembles Novel"></head><body><p>When the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044023848X">Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)</a> was first published I resisted reading it for the longest time; there was nothing about it that sounded new and interesting.  Sure, it was a self-published hit written by a home-schooled teenager, but other than that the novel sounded like a mish-mash of different fantasy sterotypes I'd read dozens of times before.  Then, someone gave it to for a birthday present and since I would never insult that person by not reading the novel I sat down one weekend and poured through the story.  Was my opinion changed?  No.  As I thought, it was a mish-mash of fantasy sterotypes and a story obviously written by a child, with a child's viewpoint on the world.  I'll grant Christopher Paolini this:  he did create interesting characters in the likes of Eragon and Saphira, but that did not save the derivative story.  Regardless of the praise Paolini has been given, he is not the reincarnation of J. R. R. Tolkien; he is not Terry Brooks reimagined; he is not the heir to Robert Jordan.<br /><br />When I sat down to watch the movie version of the novel, I came away understanding why the film was not the success the studio had hoped it would be.  The screenwriter took a mish-mash of a novel and turned it into an even bigger mish-mash of a movie.  While the film keeps the basic premise and characters of the novel, it deviates in many ways.  So much so that it barely resembles the novel upon which it is based.  Add to that some wooden acting from usually-good actors like Jeremy Irons and Djimon Honsou along with sub-par special effects and you get a movie even fans would not enjoy.  I will grant that unknown-until-now Edward Speleers was an engaging young actor with some talent and a perfect choice for the role of Eragon. He really is the saving grace of this poorly adapted film and if he can survive the failure of Eragon he just might have an acting future.</p></body></html>

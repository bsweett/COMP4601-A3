<meta name="summary" content="Scary photo"></head><body><p>This is a fine film, which along with 'Insomnia' marked a sudden change in what we expect from Robin Williams. Unlike quite a few people I've always though he was a good actor. You really can't argue about his performances in 'Good Morning Vietnam' or 'The Fisher King'. However I'll concede he has made some some turkeys in his time!<br /><br />'One Hour Photo' is something completely different. Williams plays Sy, a photo technician in a large store. He's a loner who leads a pretty sad life and who gradully becomes obessed with a family who he regularly develops photos for.<br /><br />The film develops quickly and there isn't really a wasted minute. Its well scripted, and directed with some style by Mark Romanek. This is a great example to many Hollywood filmmakers of what can be acheived through character development, rather than the unneccessary use of CGI special effects.<br /><br />At only 91 minutes in length this is film that in many ways stands up to comparison with Alfred Hitchcocks work. OK its not as good as his very best, but its not far off that standard.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Natalie's tour de force; Darren Aronofsky's excellent casting choices"></head><body><p>Vincent Cassel said in a recent 'Fresh Air' interview that there are a couple of roles in one's lifetime that require you to make a physical transformation.  He mentioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OZ2KB0">Mesrine 1 & 2 (2008, France) *ULTIMATE* 4 Disc Set (R0)</a> for him - he took on considerable weight for Part II of that film.  Here so, in 'Black Swan,' it was for Natalie Portman.  She's riveting as ballerina Nina Sayers - the once gamine Portman is all sinew, bone and iron here.  She'll get a well-deserved Oscar nomination for sure.<br /><br />Beyond Natalie, Darren Aronofsky's casting choices are excellent.  Barbara Hershey's brittle face (the result of one-too-many scalpels) give her the perfect countenance for someone with her character's infantilizing tendencies (Nina's stuffed animal-laden bedroom is a set designer's delight).  Vincent Cassel was a dancer throughout his youth - his posture, carriage and air of authority all ring true here.  Aronofsky's choice of Winona Ryder as the soloist Portman's character is replacing is his most inspired choice (there's a whiff of Mickey Rourke in that one). Her fallen star and push from the limelight trades a bit on the public's perception of her as a fallen-from-grace starlet.  Ukraine's own Mila Kunis is good here, too - her lithe physique and hard body make her a believable threat to stand in the way of Nina's dreams.<br /><br />There's a joke here about how you get guys to attend a movie about ballet: you put Portman and Kunis in bed together.  It's that scene that have led some reviewers to call this Aronofsky's "psychosexual thriller."  Whether that attracts the wrong type of crowd, I don't know.  But I will say that the scene isn't gratuitous.  It figures heavily in Nina's mental meltdown: did she dream that event?  Probably so, but even the audience is left not knowing for sure given Kunis' character's little head game.</p></body></html>

He provided me an excited commentary throughout the whole film, having seen it b4, and asked me questions on supermaniana that I knew from years of reading the comic at his age.<br /><br />For myself, I thought it was a reasonably good story:  SM returns to the Earth after a mysterious absence, during which the other characters have moved on with their lives.  Lois is married, angry at him, and has a son.  Meanwhile, Lex is at his normally evil plans, which are genuinely earthshaking in this film.  So SM saves the day, with a lot of good suspense filled in.<br /><br />There is no way, of course, that I would have bought this were it not for my son.  That being said, it was such a delight to watch it with him that I was carried away by the peculiar magic of this film, which is a mark of its success.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

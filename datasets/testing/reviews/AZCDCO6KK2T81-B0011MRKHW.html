<meta name="summary" content="Elizabeth: The Golden Age is almost golden."></head><body><p>While not quite as great and flawless as its predecessor, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a>, it is, however, something grander in scope for which character development suffers a bit.<br /><br />This sequel is filmed 10 years after the first one, but little is lost along the way.  The same writer and director are back and, of course, so is Cate Blanchett delivering yet another knockout performance as the "Virgin Queen" desperate to love, but all too aware of its perils for a queen like herself.  The supporting cast is again outstanding, and the addition of Clive Owen, my original vote for the next Bond over Daniel Craig, is an example of perfect casting.  Perhaps it's good that Owen wasn't saddled with the Bond films as it has allowed him to do films like this one.<br /><br />My only criticism of this film is also my strongest compliment in that in this film we focus more on the spectacular than on character development, but it's forgivable in that this film is simply portraying an era in Elizabeth's life that was literally more spectacular as Spain rages war on Britain with it's massive and undefeated armada.  This is not to say that we don't have emotional development in this film at all, but rather it's not on the same scale as the previous film.<br /><br />Where I gave <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a> an unqualified flawless 5 star rating, this film also gets 5 stars, but I must qualify it by saying it just not at the same level as the last film.  Both are 5 star films, but his one is just not as flawless in my view.</p></body></html>

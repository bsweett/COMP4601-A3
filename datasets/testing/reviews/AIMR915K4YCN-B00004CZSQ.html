The first time I saw it I was overwhelmed by it's beautiful sets, hypnotic music, and vicious assault sequences. It took several viewings for my mind to focus on the actual storyline! I love it. Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives at a prestigious ballet school in Germany, just in time to see a former student fleeing from the place. Suzy hears a few of the girl's parting words before she disappears into the stormy night. These words return later as keys to the entire mystery that Suzy finds herself involved in. The girl ends up butchered by a figure with a big knife, that just might not be human. The victims in this movie are all people who have seen / heard too much. They are a danger to the secret within the academy. We all know it's a coven of witches, but Argento goes all out to make it as bizarre and as interesting as possible. The "maggot invasion" and "room of coiled wires" scenes are especially memorable. Joan Bennett (Dark Shadows) is cold and enigmatic as Madame Blanc. Alida Valli is supremely menacing as Miss Tanner. I got the distinct impression that she could easily have been the she-wolf of the SS in her younger days! SUSPIRIA is a movie to be seen many times. I notice something different every time I watch it. For instance, check out the killer's fingernails in the "open-heart surgery" murder near the beginning. Also, look at the "wine" Suzy dumps in the sink, it's pretty thick doncha think?? SUSPIRIA belongs in the upper level of supernatural horror films, right next to THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, and ROSEMARY'S BABY. A masterpiece of terror and suspense...</p></body></html>

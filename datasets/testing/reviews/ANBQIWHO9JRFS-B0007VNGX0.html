<meta name="summary" content="Well... that was.... interesting"></head><body><p>I dunno quite how you should rate this movie.  Certainly, it is bad, but it is also amusing.  3 stars and a C seems fair, I suppose.  Anyway, It's really quite a sight. You don't often see movies in this day and age with this kinda of budget that is as flatly goofy as 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.  The original RE film was stupid, yes, but it really wasn't in the same league as this one in terms of sheer wackiness. (To the best of my recollection, anyway. It's been quite a while...)  Still, you've gotta give RE: Apocalypse this: It's gotta whole helluva lotta action.  It's quite nonstop the first like 2/3 of the movie, though it actually slows down some towards the end. It actually gets a little dull for a while, but the final fights, particularly the outrageous kung-fu battle between Alice and Nemesis are sufficiently hilarious as to get the movie back on track, or at least as on track as it ever was.<br /><br />Anyway, this one takes place directly after the original, with the zombies and various other monster having escaped the Hive and laying waste to Raccoon City (It's adorable that they kept that name, by the way.)  It is shortly sealed off by the Evil B*stards in charge of Umbrella.  Also, there's a scientist dude who invented the T-Virus and isn't quite as evil and he wants to get his daughter out out, and there's Nemesis whose been let loose in the city and he's a jerk, and Alice is there too and a bunch of STARS people and a reporter and also this jive-talking black dude who is quite likely to offend those who are wont to be offended by things and blah blah blah.  Anyway, they've got to run around and yell and shoot a lot of zombies and lickers and some zombie dogs whatnot.  And so they do.<br /><br />To give credit where credit is due, the set design and art direction in this film are generally quite excellent.  I particularly like the large church/cathedral they take refuge in.  However, the cinematography and editing leave a lot to be desired. It's trying to be hypermodern and flashy but it's mostly just chintzy.  I'm not really opposed to this kinda thing in and of itself, but it's easy to screw it up, and that's what they've done here.  The action scenes aren't exciting, but they do have a sorta goofy energy to them that makes them fun.  Also, the film is never in the least bit scary, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for zombies.  These ain't the greatest zombies ever, but they work.  However, the film is utterly devoid of gore, which is quite aggravating and unforgivable.  We don't even get any notable close-ups of zombies getting their brains blasted out, and you need like a bare minimum of 15 of those in your zombie movie. (You could perhaps go a bit lower here, as shooting them in the head isn't necessary, but there need to be a lot more than none of them, anyway.)<br /><br />Performances are generally either comical or flat.  Milla Jovovich is quite dull and really not all that attractive as our crazy semi-mutant hero Alice.  Sienna Guillory is our second major protagonist, Jill Valentine, and is better than Milla, or better looking anyway, which is what mostly counts in this kinda movie.  As you probably already know, they dress her as Jill was dressed in RE3,(i.e. tube top and mini skirt) which amuses me to no end.  This does not strike as the most practical battle outfit, but she didn't really have time to prepare, I guess, and she does look pretty damn hot, so I'm not complaining.  Also in attendance is some dude playing Carlos.  I do not remember a single thing about him, apart from one utterly hilarious line of dialogue.  There's also this Nickolai dude.  He's pretty cool. He's my favorite character, in fact, but he hasn't got that much screen time, sadly.<br /><br />As if I haven't made this clear yet, this is definitely a good-bad movie.  I wasn't quite laughing at it, but I was smirking, continually, which is about the same thing.  I had a good time watching it, what can I say. Wouldn't mind watching it again some day.  It gives me hope for future video game movies, that they can still be stupidly amusing.  They've headed in a bad direction as of late, with 'Silent Hill' and 'Doom' being stupidly boring rather than stupidly watchable.  RE:Apocalypse gives us the real goods, at least as far as this kinda movie goes.<br /><br />Also, it does have perhaps the greatest line in all of film.  Some STARS dudes are discussing how, after they've been left in Raccoon City, they don't matter to the corporation and they're expendable and then Carlos (I believe) says: 'We've just been expended.'  HA!!!!!!!!!  That is frickin' hilarious.  I believe the proper term would be spent.  Anyway, an entertaining movie.<br /><br />Grade: C</p></body></html>

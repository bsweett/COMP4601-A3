I was promised the scariest movie ever when I bought my tickets from the guy behind the glass who proceeded to tell me that he has never been so scared then he was while watching this movie.  Guess what.  The movie is not that scary.  But, and this is a big but, after watching it a second time, without the hype, you begin to see what is so great about this film.  While it's not pee your pants scary, the intensity that builds is more of a mental "what would you do if this happened to you" type scare.  It's meant to attack your subconscious, making you place yourself in the scene and then decide how you'd react.  Cillian Murphy has proven this past year that he is a great acter, but this is the first I'd ever seen of him, and after watching I already knew he was a star in the making.  The film has it's cult following and it has it's fans, it also has die-hard haters as well.  This is a film to watch with no expectations because it won't make you shudder or close your eyes in fear like so many newer horror films will (as far as scares are concerned the remake TCM is much much more effective) but as far as originality and yes, brilliant directing, is concerned then this is a film to watch filled with decent acting, a decent script and plenty of tasty camera tricks that will have you glued.  Just don't expect to lose sleep over it.</p></body></html>

In "I, Robot," the high-tech, low-brow adaptation of the classic Isaac Asimov story, he plays pretty much the same guy he always does . . . hip, cocky, fast talking, street smart, etc., etc.  Perhaps on purpose, he looks the human version of the robots, which themselves appear the result of mannequins who traded stem cells with Robocop and an iMac.  Just bolt some skin to the frame and put him in a leather coat conveniently in style today even though the film takes place 30 years from now and, well, you get the point.  A clever attempt to give the film more subtext than it has -- you know, robots aren't much different than us?  Or perhaps a plot twist?  I suppose if you care you'll have to find out for yourself.<br /><br />The film retains some elements of Asimov's seminal work, though in many ways, it has more in common with 1972's "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes," with its examination of slavery as a theme and even a guy jumping out of a high rise to his death, and the far superior "Bladerunner."  The story's mystery is predictably shallow, about the same as the one in "Minority Report," which it also mimics, and to make up for it, there are plenty of action set pieces, done with expensive but sterile CGI effects.  Essentially, robots programmed with three laws against harming humans start to do just that, starting with their creator.  What follows is a revolution of sorts, threatening Shannon Elizabeth clone Briget Moynahan (bad) and the often irritating Shia LeBoeuf (good), who Hollywood in its infinite wisdom seems bound and determined to turn into a star regardless.<br /><br />"I, Robot" isn't a bad movie, but it's not a good one, either.  Visually, it has its moments, but the story never rises above a shallow examination of the premise, and the product placement borders on the absurd.  Yeah, it's a summer movie.  But that's all that it is.</p></body></html>

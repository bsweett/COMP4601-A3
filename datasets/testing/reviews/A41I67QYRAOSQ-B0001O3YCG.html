People marooned on a desert planet with a surprise when the sun goes down ("Pitch-Black).  Riddick as always is a tough guy whose character you will like and want to see him in more movies. The choice of characters was very good.  You develop distinct feelings towards each one and the writers did not let those emotions go to waste.  Excellent cinematography.  You will be on the edge of your seat waiting for the boogey men!</p></body></html>

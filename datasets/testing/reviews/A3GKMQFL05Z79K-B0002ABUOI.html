<meta name="summary" content="Dawn of the Dead........."></head><body><p>Dawn of the Dead is the 2004 'reimagining'(if you will) of George Romero's low-budget zombie classic from the 70's of the same name. Like the original, the film depicts a handful of human survivors who find shelter in a shopping mall only to be surrounded by swarms of zombies. It's quite different than the original. The film is directed by Zack Snyder(best known for the movie, 300). It stars Ving Rhames, Jack Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Sarah Polley and Kim Poirier. Unlike the Night of the Living Dead remake, Dawn of the Dead was made on a $28,000,000 budget and it shows. The movie itself grossed over $102,356,381 to date and is still doing well in DVD sales. It's a favorite among zombie fans. This edition includes footage that was intended to be in the movie originally but was cut for theatrical release. The DVD offers several other scenes which were not included in any version of the film as well as more. Very entertaining reimagining, if you ask me. I enjoyed it very much.</p></body></html>

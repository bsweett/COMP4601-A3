<meta name="summary" content="A Perplexing Film from M. Night Shyamalan"></head><body><p>LADY IN THE WATER is a very tough film to review.  M. Night Shyamalan is doubtless a new thinker and has produced some original and interesting films (none of which equal the promise of his first one THE SIXTH SENSE) and LADY IN THE WATER has some very good aspects.  It is just such a mixed bag, full of holes and hints of personal vendettas that it ultimately fails to achieve what it sets out to do.<br /><br />The opening sequence tells a tale in charming line drawings about how we all used to be water people but how man gradually went on land, gained money and power, and became estranged from the purity of the water people: the ladies of the water will try to return reason to the land people but the journey will be fraught with danger.<br /><br />Transfer that tale to real time and we find the disconsolate manager of an apartment house Cleveland Heep (a brilliant, stammering Paul Giammati) whose rules for the building dwellers include no smoking and no swimming in the pool after seven evening.  He discovers a swimmer in the night pool, rescues her, learns her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and gives her a Gilead in his meager room.  He discovers with the help of one of his tenant's Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) hesitant mother that Story is a narf, a creature from a bedtime story who is sent from the Blue World to imbue reason to a certain man (One who will return 'civilization' to mankind) and then return to her world on the wings of an eagle.  Heep takes it upon himself to find the One who will allow Story to complete her mission, protecting her from the monsters in the night that would destroy her plight.<br /><br />In seeking the One, we meet the buildings tenants: Reggie (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez) bent on working out only one side of his body (!); Mr. Dury (the always fine Jeffrey Wright) who is committed to solving crossword puzzles with his son Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey); a Mrs. Hill (Mary Beth Hurt) who seems to have spiritual affinities; the odd Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin) who foresees things; a newspaper critic (Bob Balaban); a writer Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan himself), who appears to be the One who will answer the goal of Story, and his sister Anna (Sarita Choudhury): and a bizarre group of smokers and a family of Hispanic immigrant sisters.  All of these characters are woven into the conclusion of the bedtime story as we watch the intial tale come to resolution.<br /><br />It plays better on paper than on film as there are so many loops and problems with the plot that it becomes silly.  But the film is saved by the actors, Giamatti especially, who makes us love him and his very troubled past shrouded in secrets, and Howard who truly does allow us to suspend disbelief in her otherworldly portrayal of the lonely and needy water nymph.  You simply have to be in the mood for this kind of film and forgive Shyamalan his oversights and vanity, and if you can do that it is a pleasant little diversion.

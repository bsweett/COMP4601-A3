<meta name="summary" content="A creepy, gory, intelligent, adult fantasy film."></head><body><p>This film won 3 Oscars (Art Direction, Cinematography, Makeup) and richly deserved all three.  The set designs are ingenious and supremely creative, the photography is lush and gorgeous to behold, and the makeup is simply genius.  This is a tale of a little girl who attempts to escape the horrors of the real world exploding around her during wartime.  She enters into a realm that at first seems benign and safe until her subconscious fears rise to the surface and her fantasies overlap her reality until she is unable to distinguish between the two.  "Pan's Labyrinth" is a genuine masterpiece of adult fantasy.  There is a lot of gore in this film, so parents should beware.  While viewing this film in the theater there were plenty of moments that had the audience gasping and wincing at how much pain the characters must be enduring.  For parents who remain unconvinced I have only one thing to say, "bone-saw".  Cringe.  But far beyond the gory makeup, the creature effects are marvelous and completely wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that a minimum of computer effects are used in this film and the creatures are actually there moving, blinking, scheming.  The computer effects that are incorporated are blended seemlessly and add polish to the overall imagination of the film.  "Pan's Labyrinth" slides easily into my top ten list of foreign films where it now holds company with greats like Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" and Zhang Yimou's "To Live".  Beautiful!</p></body></html>

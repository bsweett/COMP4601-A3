<meta name="summary" content="Flawed, but a promising debut"></head><body><p>Vampires fighting werewolves, and Kate Beckinsale in leather, are the twin promises of "Underworld", and you'll probably be happy if your expectations are no higher than that.  To be fair, the lavish digital imagery suggested by the trailer is deployed with impressive restraint, and the film is distinguished from most other effects-intensive offerings by its determination to tell a story.  The problem is that the story it chooses to tell is convoluted, unmotivated and, in the end, not a particularly thrilling one.  What starts as a promising detective-tale-with-love-interest collapses under the weight of its own backstory and the apparent need to lay the ground work for a sequel. A tale of night-stalking monsters, blood disorders and forbidden love is surely ripe for a psycho-sexual subtext, but Danny McBride's screenplay seems content to make a few passing references to black slavery and leave it at that.  He was clearly more concerned with writing chase sequences involving a variety of expensive vehicles and cramming in enough "acting" roles for all his old stuntman buddies.  As director, Len Wiseman's adman pedigree is far too obvious.  He delivers one or two interesting shots, but generally relies on an aesthetic owing too much to rock videos, computer games and "The Matrix" ever to be truly engaging in its own right.  Still, the whole package shows enough promise to keep me interested in what these guys do next.  On a budget of $23 million, they've delivered a lot of movie for the money.</p></body></html>

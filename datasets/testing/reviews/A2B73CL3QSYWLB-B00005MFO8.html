<meta name="summary" content="Sci-Fi Fantasy Still Holds Up"></head><body><p>Unlike alot of the sc-fi films from the sixties with a message, "Planet of the Apes" still holds up remarkably well due to the strength of it's story, production values, and the acting.  The film has a coherent narrative which was definitely lacking in Tim Burton's version.  The world in which the apes inhabit is richly imagined.  The basic premise of man's inhumanity to itself and other creatures may be heavy-handed at times but not overly so.  The ape make-up is breathtaking and does not impede the actors sporting it.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner has assembled a first-rate cast with Charlton Heston solid as the astronaut, Taylor, Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter give superb performances as the sympathetic ape scientists Cornelius and Zira and Maurice Evans appropriately crotchety as head ape scientist Dr. Zaius.  Linda Harrison, wife of a then Fox executive, is visually stunning as Nova, the human girl the apes attempt to mate with Taylor.</p></body></html>

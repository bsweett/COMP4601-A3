<meta name="summary" content="Powerful movie, but too few &quot;extra goodies&quot;"></head><body><p>On disc 1, the film looks and sounds GREAT!  And with 4 different running commentaries, you'll invest 8+ hours to hear it all. I'll skip the film review and synopsis - if you're reading this you have most likely already seen the film, right? Disc 2 contains only one deleted scene, but does include the &quot;extended&quot; version of some scenes - optional commentary gives you insight as to why cuts were made. Only moderately interesting.  Lots of disc space is dedicated to crime scene photos created as props, but again not terribly gripping, at least not compared to what numerous other Special Edition DVD's have to offer.  After all the goodies we've seen added to DVD's of &quot;The Abyss&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot;, and New Line's own &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies, and &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, DVD buyers are used to getting more behind-the-scenes documentaries, out-takes, marketing campaigns, etc.  Or maybe that's just what I was personally hoping for with this disc set. Granted, the 4 commentaries are great and insightful.  But I usually expect New Line Special Editions to go the extra mile with (as in this case) second disc supplemental materials.  I don't think they did in this case.  So, it begs the question -- rent it or buy it? Well, if you rent it, bear in mind that with the movie itself and 4 commentary tracks you'll need to watch it 5 times total to get all you can off disc 1.  So if it is a &quot;One Day&quot; New Release rental at your video store you'll be in for a long night.  But if you are a DVD collector, it's a no-brainer -- shell out the bucks, dude.  But modify your expecations.</p></body></html>

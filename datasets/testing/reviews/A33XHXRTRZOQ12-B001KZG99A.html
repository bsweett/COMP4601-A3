It's so economically directed, (it's directed by Foggy Nelson himself, Jon Favreau, from the highly underrated "Daredevil",) and so cleverly written, you forgive any sins the movie might committ along the way, (like how did Stark manage to make that rather lethal suit of INITIAL armor, [that in the comic book series he kept for about 40 issues,] from scraps found in the woebegone Afghani desert!?! Or how can he fly around the world on the tiny cannister of fuel he carries on himself while clad as Iron Man?)<br /><br />Anyway, what you enjoy most about this movie is the clever dialogue as delivered by Downey, the wizard action sequences as the sleeker, upgraded Iron Man goes about his business, and the finally, DECENTLY done CGI special effects, (in films about Marvel heroes, the CGI is too often WOEFULLY, obviously not real, ruining the illusion and hence the full enjoyment of some of the films. Both "Hulk" movies and the first two "Spiderman" flicks being cases in point.)<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, who has a knack for being in really good sci-fi action movies that are a cut above the pack, ("Sky Captain",) plays Tony Stark's/Iron Man's assistant and possible love interest Pepper Potts, (can you believe that name?!) Favreau gives himself a small part as Tony's chauffeur and Jeff Bridges, (who, I must say, has aged a bit since "The Big Lebowski"...he actually seems upper-middle-aged here!) plays an old friend of Tony's dad with an impossible biblical sounding name, Obidiah Stain, that surprises us all by the end of the film.<br /><br />I have yet to see a bad review of this movie, and it IS enjoyable, but is it because of Downey, Bridges, Paltrow, ILM or what...? It really doesn't do anything wrong, and really, isn't that what we most want from a movie...?</p></body></html>

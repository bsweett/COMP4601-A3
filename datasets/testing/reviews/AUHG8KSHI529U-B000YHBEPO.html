<meta name="summary" content="Big, Noisy, and has more than one fair damsel to rescure while chasing a McGuffin"></head><body><p>It wasn't Tom Cruise that kept me away from seeing this movie in the theater, it was the second film in this series.  I hated it.  The first was good, but the second was completely and utterly a waste.  This one is much better than the second, but not as interesting as the first.  Cruise is ok as Ethan Hunt, but I think this series could do better with someone more interesting.  What this movie has going for it is the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The problem is that the movie could use more of him than it gives us.<br /><br />The whole thing is an excuse for daring rescues, impossible fights, big booms, bright and ridiculous explosions, and fair damsels in distress (in their modern fighting form).  The conceit of the movie is that Hoffman is an international supplier of bad things to bad people in bad governments.  In this movie there is something called a Rabbit's Foot and is never explained.  It is a McGuffin.  That is, what it is doesn't matter, that it motivates action does.<br /><br />You can pretty much guess what happens and how it ends before it starts.  But it is still some light and exciting fun along the way.  However, it requires you to not think or your fun will be spoiled.  So, keep that in mind when you pick a day and time to watch it.</p></body></html>

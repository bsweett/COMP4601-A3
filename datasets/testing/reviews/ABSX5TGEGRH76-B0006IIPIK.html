It didn't even recoup half of what it cost to make, and judging by the amazing effects this movie had, I'm guessing that it was pretty expensive.  I blame marketing; I cannot remember ever wanting to see it until after it was released on DVD, and people I know and online reviewers told me to go see it.<br /><br />In New York City, circa 1939 (albeit, an alternate timeline 1939), reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been investigating a group of scientists who have been mysteriously disappearing.  All of them have been linked to a pre-WWI project based out of Berlin and led by a mysterious man named Totenkopf.  Soon after meeting with the 7th scientist, a legion of giant robots begin attacking the city, and only Joseph "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) can save the day.  After he barely fights off the bots, the mechanical menaces receive a radio signal that Sky Captain's assistant, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi) begins to trace.  Dex is kind of like the Q to Sky Captain's James Bond; he makes gadgets and modifications to the planes used by Sky Captain and his "army for hire".<br /><br />Soon, Polly and Sky Captain begin a journey to find Totenkopf and discover why he has been sending his robots to destroy major cities (New York wasn't the only target).  Along the way, they meet up with Sky Captain's old friend Francesca "Franky" Cook (Angelina Jolie), a Royal Navy commander with one of the coolest air fleets ever to appear on film (although her role is more of a cameo than a featured one, as the trailers and box art would have you believe).<br /><br />If I could, I guess I would give this movie 4 and 1/2 stars instead of 5, but since I can't I feel that it deserves the 5 rather than the 4.  I can kind of see why some people didn't like this movie; there were some lapses in logic, and some of the situations seem kind of dated.  What the naysayers don't understand is, that was kind of the point.  This movie is a homage to old 1940's and 50's era comics and adventure stories.  One could almost call this "Indiana Jones meets Star Wars" (which I think the director really was going for, since there is a George Lucas reference on one of the scientist's doors).  This film isn't about winning Oscars (except maybe in the visual effects categories), it's about retro fun.  It's about paying respect to classic filmmaking that we really don't get to see anymore.  This is a must-see for any Lucas/Speilberg fan, and I would really reccomend it to anyone.</p></body></html>

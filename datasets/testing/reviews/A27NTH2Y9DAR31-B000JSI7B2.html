<meta name="summary" content="Saucy Jack Revisited"></head><body><p>The first time I learned of the "true" identity of Jack the Ripper was from a book by Steven Knight, who I feel is the closest and most viable resource for this elusive killer's identity and facts surrounding the case. The movie adheres to much of Knight's solution and tells the tale in a dark, appropriately frightening fashion. Depp is, as usual, up to the task of portraying Frederick Abberline, lead detective on the case, and one of the few voices of reason (albeit through a haze of either drink or drugs) throughout this melange of criminals, both low and high estate, all the way to Buckingham Palace, who orchestrated this serial killing to maintain the Monarchy and keep it intact for the sake of England, ostensibly. I was not surprised to see that, at the end of the movie, Victoria feels gratitude that "we" have been saved, and not to make any further references to this episode..."we" are most grateful for your discretion in this matter. The implication of the Duke of Clarence, and what happened to his poor wife and child, is well-documented here, and when taken in context of the story and research that went into this production, one feels convinced that indeed, this is what happened and why. Ian Holm is wonderful in his role of Sir Wm. Gull, physician to the Queen, and the architect of the plan which she was entirely aware of from the ineception of same, and bore out my own feelings with respect to how much she played a part in these killings. Great atmosphere and really presents a window into Vicotrian London and the plight of the East End, and the tragic lives these women led, all very well-represented here. "We" were eminently entertained and thought the movie was well-directed and very well acted. If you are a Ripperologist, or merely curious, see this one...</p></body></html>

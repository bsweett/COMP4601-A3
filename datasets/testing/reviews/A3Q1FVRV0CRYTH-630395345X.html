Upon it's release it opened eyes and paved the way for films to come that will continue to draw from this masterpiece of a film, never being able to capture what made this so brilliant in the first place.  With his second film, follow up to 92's 'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin Tarantino solidified his Hollywood status as a brilliant director/writer.  The story behind 'Pulp Fiction' is one we've never seen, and one that will never be seen again, at least not to the original brilliance here.<br /><br />The film opens with a conversation between Pumpkin (Roth) and Honey Bunny (Plummer), lovers who are about to knock over a restaurant.  This whole film is about conversations, conversations that may or may not pertain to the events about to occur but which add depth to the characters you're watching on the screen.<br /><br />The next scene introduces us to hit men Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) as they are about to make a hit for mob-boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).  The conversation that ensues is fluent, natural and not what you'd expect.  It's called a brilliant script coupled with brilliant acting.  Besides being ordered to make this hit, Vincent has also been asked to tend to Marsallus's wife Mia (Thurman) while he's out of town on business.  After hearing that Marsellus is quite the jealous type (having just thrown a man from a five story building for allegedly rubbing Mia's feet) he's a bit edgy about tending to her needs while Marsellus is away.<br /><br />Marsellus is also taking care of some business with boxer Butch Coolidge (Willis), a prizefighter whom Marsellus has just paid to take the fall.  When Butch decides to renig, winning the match and attempting to split town with his girlfriend Fabieene (de Medeiros) Marsellus hires Vega to take him out.<br /><br />These three stories get interwoven in not so chronological order giving us three great stories that make one really awesome movie.  Uma is stunning and captivating, Travolta is o top of his game and Jackson is scene stealing in his best role ever.  Willis and Rhames feed off each other perfectly and add a side story that is both hilarious in it's own seriousness.  Great film most everyone can enjoy.  There's a reason this film is considered legendary!</p></body></html>

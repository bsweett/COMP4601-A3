One of the first things that I noticed is that the theater is still full, even with the release this weekend of The Incredible Hulk [Theatrical Release]. One other thing that I noticed is that the 15-20 minutes of pre-show commercials have gotten more annoying than ever. I mean, how many times to I have to be pounded with Verizon ads, over and over again? Ugh!<br /><br />But on to the movie. This fourth Indiana Jones effort takes our hero forward 20 years, into 1957. Instead of Nazi's he's now battling Communists. Seriously, what would Indiana do if he didn't have an evil empire to fight with. The attempt here by the film makers is to go back to the original formula of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009Q98M">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Widescreen Edition) [Region 2</a>], something that was missing in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7OMZ2">Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom - Widescreen Version (1984)</a> and only partially there in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7OPCC">Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade - Widescreen Edition</a>. We are back to the "serial" format, where every 10 minutes he's put into an impossible situation only to get himself out again.<br /><br />There are many things to like here. Harrison Ford not only plays a great "older" Jones but seems to actually embrace it. The return of Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood (now Williams) was better than I expected. Still tough and very much the equal of Jones when it comes to wit. Shia Labeouf plays Marion's son and does a more than credible job. Cate Blanchett and John Hurt both tend to steal scenes and are wonderful additions.<br /><br />But, there are also things here that are not so great. The plot, while starting off well, begins to get a bit hokey. Some of the action sequences have strayed from the unbelievable to the ludicrous. And the resolution of it all almost became silly. Not quite, but almost.<br /><br />Still, overall it was a great escape into two hours of sheer fun. And the final scene with Indy and Marion left open the possibility of another Indiana Jones movie, but with a different hero. Could be interesting!</p></body></html>

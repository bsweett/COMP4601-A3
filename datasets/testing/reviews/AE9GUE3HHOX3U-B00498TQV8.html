<meta name="summary" content="The Wizard Of Oz"></head><body><p>I'm sorry but I just couldn't get into this movie.  It's billed as a "thriller" but it's nowhere near that.  It reminded me of "The Wizard of Oz" like Dorthey going all over the place to no end looking for the Oz, but here it's Ree looking for her father.  This film was quite dull and uneventful and nearly put me to sleep.  They didn't even show Ree chainsawing her father's hands off at the end.  At least show us something memorable and gory after we spent hours watching her look for this guy.  Another thing is I'm not into any movie that deals with the crystal meth thing.  I don't find it entertaining and I don't want to go down that road!  I guess I was disillusioned, especially hearing it had Oscar buzz and all that.  Different strokes for different folks.</p></body></html>

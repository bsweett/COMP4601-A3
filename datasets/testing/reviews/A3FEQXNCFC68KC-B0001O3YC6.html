<meta name="summary" content="Just get the individual disks."></head><body><p>When I first saw this two movie release I was hoping is was two Blu-Ray disks in one package. It's not. You are getting the two individual movies (in two separate cases) just wrapped in special packaging. At least the disks have all the same special features as the individual release so these aren't cheap theatrical release only kinds of disks. However when you look at the current price for this two movie set you really aren't getting anything special here. I think it's better to just get the individual movies.<br /><br />Plus a lot of the complaints I hear about Chronicles of Riddick freezing up seem to come from this package set more than the separate movie release. Now if any of you out there have been worried about buying these movies because of that I think it's been a decent amount of time enough for Sony to have either corrected the manufacturing procedure that made that bad batch or for that batch to be phased out. My recommendation is (until there is absolute confirmation there are no more bad copies) go buy the movie at a brick and mortal store that offers returns. If you have a bad copy go back with your receipt and tell them. They will likely just let you get another copy of the movie. If so let then know about the situation. Maybe they can cross-check distribution and all that to make sure you new copy is from a different batch.<br /><br />The Riddick movies are great and the Blu-Rays look and sound awesome. I just don't see any benefit on getting them in a two pack deal if there are no significant discounts.</p></body></html>

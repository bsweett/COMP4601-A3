I just told them to trust me and crammed them into the theater.  This is the first time I went to a film after hearing the Hollywood buzz and had not been disappointed.  This movie and especially Jennifer Hudson deserves everything that's happening right now.  In my theater after the BIG number Hudson received a thunderous applause and again at the end of the movie.  My friends raved for hours after the show-so overall it was great music and great performances.  You will not be disappointed.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

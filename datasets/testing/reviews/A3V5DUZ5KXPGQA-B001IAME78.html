<meta name="summary" content="This Is On The Film Itself"></head><body><p>December 9, 2008<br /><br />This is an update of my original review. Since that time, I have purchased the special 3 disc set and now its Blu-Ray version! Both look great on an HDTV and the Blu-Ray version is VERY clear!<br /><br />As for the film itself, let me tell you it will make you forget about the 2003 film Hulk! While the TV version with the late Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno will always be the Hulk to me, this is the way you should do the comic Hulk!<br /><br />These guys definitely took the best from both the TV show and the comics and blended them together into one great film. This film definitely gets a 5 star rating from me for non-stop action and a little bit of drama and storytelling. While I am sure everyone knows, it ties into the recent Iron-Man release. Perhaps a showdown between the two on the big screen soon? We'll see!<br /><br />Back to this, the transformations are great and they make more sense here than in Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003. While the Hulk did get stronger as he got angrier, I don't recall any version of him growing due to the rage! That made it a bit ridiculous to me. Here, he stays a consistent size and it just as menacing and scary at times. The villian Emil Blonsky (The Abomination) is much better than the villian in Hulk (though Nick Nolte did do a good job with what he had in 2003) and an actual threat to The Hulk.<br /><br />Overall, this won't be a waste of your money, no matter what version you get! This is a must buy for comic fans and action junkies!</p></body></html>

While Robocop was great, I didn't enjoy Total Recall all that much and Basic Instinct is basically a movie you shouldn't like but for some reason it draws you in(it's probably because of clothesless Sharon Stone). Less said about Showgirls too, the better. He followed that awful movie with this one, which despite not making back it's budget, it has an odd cult following at times with people loving it's fascism parodys and its almost endless gore. It's very campy at times but also it's got some great action scenes and some very nifty visual effects.<br /><br />It's many years in the future and people get to enlist in the Army and do service and they get guaranteed citizenship instead of being civilians(I never caught the difference). 3 friends: Johnny, Carl and Carmen join up, each joining different divisions. Johnny's in the mobile infantry unit, who gets to be up close and personal with huge insects, dodging flying body parts in the process.<br /><br />In the commentary, star Casper Van Dien says the film should've won over Titanic. True, in looking at Titanic there is a couple of odd looking shots but it was really technically impressive. This film is also wow-inducing too, especially the Zulu inspired shot with probably hundreds of bugs in the same shot. Some of the space shots during battles looking kind of odd but the bugs are very impressive, my favorite being these flying "hoppers".<br /><br />Keep in mind adults: this film is really violent. Heads get knocked off, bodies cut in two, legs, arms, women aren't spared either. It doesn't get in the way of the action scenes which are very exciting and visually impressive. One of my favorite bugs is these things that, I don't know how to describe it but they s**t this plasma out into the air, smacking into ships and causing damage. Too bad they're not in here much. And since this is Verhoeven you get a big shower scene with lots of T&A.<br /><br />The campy parts come in it's broadcasts where the film will act like a commercial at parts, giving you information on battle strategies and the government's plan on defeating the bugs. It's hard not to miss the message, like where soldiers show kids guns and show how to aim. Subtlety isn't exactly Paul's strong suit but the message comes through. The "would you like to know more?" still gets me chuckling when it comes on.<br /><br />It's a film that you'll absolutely love it, or simply won't get it. Some will probably just love the action scenes, others think it's too violent. To me, it's a great romp that's finally for adults to enjoy.</p></body></html>

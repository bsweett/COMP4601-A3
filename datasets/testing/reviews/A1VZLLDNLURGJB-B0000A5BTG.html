I agree with most reviewers that this film was not hard sci-fi, but had some nice ideas, good CGI and fine performances.  I don't think there is enough there to warrant several viewings.<br /><br />Note, that the term "unobtainium alloy" referred to in the plot was widely used by many engineers (at least) since 1971 when I heard it jokingly referred to at P&WA's materials research & development lab (MRDL). It was probably coined and used years ago by other engineers and scientists and the author did not originate this cute handle.</p></body></html>

Brendan Fraser hams it up delightfully as the roguish ex-legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is roped in (forgive the dreadful pun!) into helping Egyptologist Evelyn played by Rachel Weisz to locate the lost city of Hamunaptra and its many wonderful treasures.  Unfortunately Hamunaptra has many secrets, some of them very, very nasty and the nastiest secret of all is the evil priest Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo.  I have to admit Arnold Vosloo made the film for me, as did the young woman who played the Pharaoh's mistress and his lover, Patricia Velazquez, she was superb, shame she had such a small part in the film!  The special effects were amazing, and the humour rib chucklingly funny.  I mean who can forget the moment when Imhotep's still decomposing body falls out of the coffin and Rick, Evelyn and her brother Jonathan played stupendously by John Hannah look at each other and say simultaneously, "he's still so.......JUICY!"  I howled with both laughter and fright.  This is a great film with some gruesome moments but mostly in my opinion this is a comedy of horrors that makes you both jump and laugh in fright.  I won't give away anymore of the plot but it is worth seeing and a double disc compellation special makes it twice as good.  Worth seeing for the hammy acting and clich&eacute;s that make it horrifically good fun for everyone.</p></body></html>

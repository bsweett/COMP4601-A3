It has a very late 60's early 70's feel to the movie. It makes you feel like you are watching a classic horror film from the very beginning. The reason I only gave it four stars is because of the ending. The whole Dr. Satan looking like something from a sci-fi movie, just took me out of the movie. I dont know for some reason it just didnt work for me. Overall though the movie is great, the look and feel of it was just refreshing. It isnt your normal horror movie.</p></body></html>

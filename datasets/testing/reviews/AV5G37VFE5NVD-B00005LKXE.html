Finally, they have it - although I'm sure it's not at all what they expected.  HANNIBAL is the result of what most will see as a Ridley Scott-Anthony Hopkins-Hans Zimmer collaboration.  Adapted from Thomas Harris' best-selling (although much weaker) novel, HANNIBAL follows only the basic plot of the novel.  Anthony Hopkins returns to his Oscar-winning role as cannibal genius Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is now roaming freely in Italy.  However, after many years he decides he'd like to come out of retirement; without spoiling any &quot;surprises&quot;, he attempts to make contact with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, taking over from Jodie Foster), while running from his only surviving victim's (Gary Oldman) assassins.  Hopkins' performance is great and yet you can't help laughing at Dr. Lecter, so polite and yet the deadliest man alive; Moore tries her hardest, but she comes nowhere near close to taking up where Foster previously stood.  There is also a terrific score by Hans Zimmer; the highlight of the film, of course, however, is Scott's directing.  It may be the absolute weakest sequel THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS could have, but HANNIBAL is still a frightening and effective horror thriller.</p></body></html>

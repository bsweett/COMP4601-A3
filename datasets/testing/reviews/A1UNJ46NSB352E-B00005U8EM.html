The first one was a &quot;bare-bones&quot; edition, with no special features.  This one is nowhere near the calibur of the latest &amp; greatest DVD's (Moulin Rouge, Episode I) as far as extra features go, but there is a great half-hour retrospective documentary featuring all the major players in this film except Bill Murray.  This movie was also one of the greatest romantic comedies (or pure comedies) of the past decade.  Bill Murray is dead-on as the weatherman who fancies himself a big-time talent and celebrity who gets stuck in a town because of a blizzard, only to be stuck there repeating the same day for seemingly forever.  I felt this movie did a great job exploring the progression of how a person would first exploit that type of situation, then get depressed by it, then accept it.  I definitely recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NICE SNATCH"></head><body><p>Folowing on from the very enjoyable and original low budget Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, this could almost be considered Lock, Stock part II as it reunites most of the cast and crew and it's another gangster movie set in London. However, although the stories are similar there are enough differences and new twists to allow this movie to be considered as a good and original movie in its own right.<p>Snatch starts with some jocular credits, and the robbery of an Antwerp diamond merchant's office by four thieves disguised as Hasidic Jews. Initially appear in black and white on a succession of CCTV screens, then when they reach their target, they're in colour as they grab the guns concealed on the chest of their leader. Seizing an 86-carat, size of your fist, diamond the robbers head to London to sell the stone and of course this is where the fun starts as all types of cockney and foreign misfits then become involved in the theft and counter-theft and attempted sale of said diamond. <p>Among the colourful array of characters on parade this time are jewish jewellers (Mike Reid and Dennis Farina), cockney hardman Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), a truly disgusting underground fight promoter by the unlikely name of Brick Top (Alan Ford), a Russian hitman - Boris the blade (Rade Serbedzija), a fight manager - Turkish (Jason Statham), and Irish traveller Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt). Ultimately the surprisingly excellent Brad Pitt steals the movie as the boxing `yardy' nobody can understand but veteran British actor Alan Ford as the disgusting `Brick Top' runs him close for best performance kudos.<p>Like its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch is full of twists and turns and plenty of black humour but unlike its predecessor it's a bit more violent and the language is even stronger. It will probably still be unfairly compared to Tarantino but its still a clever and fun movie. My only criticism of Guy Ritchie would be that he needs to learn that less is sometimes more; the movie doesn't need as many twists and it doesn't need so many alternative showy camera angles and film styles. Don't get me wrong, they're good, just a couple too many. This is a four star movie that could have been five. <p>Pretty much the whole world knows Guy Ritchie's name now. Sadly most people rather insultingly and condescendingly know him as Mr Madonna but just like her first husband cruelly christened Mr Madonna, Sean Penn, Guy Ritchie is a great talent in his own right. However, the acid test of Guy Ritchie's talent will come with his next movie starring `er indoors (as they say in cockney vernacular), the so far allergic to anything resembling believable acting Madonna. If he can get a decent performance out of Mrs Ritchie he truly will be hailed as a genius.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Classic New-Action Movie."></head><body><p>Action movies have been around for a long time (just watch some old Cagney or Bogart gangster flicks if you don't believe me). However, it wasn't until the late 70s and early 80s that action movies entered a new domain: that of the superhuman who blows lots of things up due to a big budget. DIE HARD set a new template in the action genre because Bruce Willis' character really isn't a superhuman, he's just a good cop who uses his wits to out smart the bad guys.<p>The movie re-ignited Willis' film career and his star performance as the bare-footed hero is rather well done for an action film. Alan Rickman is great as the slimy villian, Hans Gruber and Reginald Vel Johnson is a joy to watch as the befuddled cop who becomes friends with Willis' character over the radio.<p>Overall a great movie that has lots of action, a decent script, a little romance, and an admirable; yet human hero.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A wolf in sheep's clothing"></head><body><p>The basic problem of The Grey is the difference between what the filmmakers think they had and what the marketing department wanted to sell. This is promoted as a dramatic survival action movie in the trailers and even Liam Neeson's talk-show circuit tour pushed the same line - a plane crashes and a bunch of guys have to survive things that want to eat them. Kind of 'Alive' meets Jurassic Park. With Ra's al Ghul.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's this difference that's going to disappoint most of the audience. The film starts with Liam's melancholic voice-over (which isn't a good sign) and a fairly dim setup of oil-riggers beating the ever-loving out of each other. We then see Liam shooting a wolf, lamenting the loss of his wife and then putting a rifle in his mouth and contemplating sparing us from another 2 hours of this. And it gets more depressing from there when the trip home ends abruptly in a plane crash.<br /><br />It's at this point that the film's indecision about what it is becomes a real problem. As an action or survival film, Liam guides his band of survivors in the most irresponsible way possible, making mistake after mistake and fundamentally dooming them all to becoming wolf entree. There are some basic errors, such as a stack of shotgun shells packed with his rifle, and anybody who's familiar with wolf behavior is going to be really unhappy at their depiction in this film. Anyone from Alaska is going to be even more unhappy at the depiction of swimming in rapids too.<br /><br />Also as an action film, the wolves have a supernatural capability to outsmart the survivors and behave more like Spielberg's raptors than any real life wolf. At one point they jump a ravine and the wolfs are waiting with GPS precision. They pick off our band of survivors one at a time, leaving us with intermittent testosterone-fueled in-fighting to pass as drama. If only Liam hadn't left the crash site, where rescue teams would already have arrived with burgers and cocoa.<br /><br />But here's the problem - it's not an action film. It's not a survival film either. It's a psychological drama about facing death where the wolves act as furry metaphors for the grim reaper. From the very first scene to the last, Liam Neeson (who's very good as always) emphasizes this theme and it reverberates over and over. And that's where the film could have been quite good and a welcome break from the survival genre but unfortunately it's too late by the time it becomes clear that the wolves' uncanny supernatural sense has a very good explanation.<br /><br />My guess is that the everyone expecting an action drama is going to be very unhappy, along with animal rights, PETA, Alaskans and oil-riggers. It's a real shame they didn't recut the trailer before the release.</p></body></html>

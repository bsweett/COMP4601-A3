I'm ugly."<br /><br />I really liked this sequel, even though it kind of strayed away from the much darker tone creator Mike Mignola had infused into his Hellboy comics (the first movie was more on par with Mignola's vision). But, if you're down with visually dazzling feasts and with Hellboy and Abe Sapien gettting their drink on and serenading each other with a Barry Manilow lament, then you won't find much to nag about in HELLBOY 2: THE GOLDEN ARMY. If you've seen and been entranced with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a>, then this is more of director Guillermo del Toro unleashing his vivid, vivid imagination.<br /><br />A set-up: Lost ages ago, mankind went to war against the supernatural kinds. In desperation, an army of golden mechanical warriors, numbering 70 by 70, was created for the elven king, and a magical crown to control this army. But such devastation was wrought by this invincible army that the king felt regret and enabled a cessation of hostilities between man and the faerie folk. In good faith, the crown was broken into three pieces, one piece given to man for safekeeping - and, so, the golden army fell dormant. But Prince Nuada, fierce son of the elven king, rebuked the peace and vanished in a self-imposed exile, vowing to return in his people' direst need.<br /><br />Well, dude's back. This time, he's bent on re-establishing the dominion of faerie kind. And he'll achieve this by wresting control of the indestructible golden army from the aged king, who now dwells in the sewers of New York. And, so, as Nuada begins to gather the pieces of the crown, all that stands between him and the cowing of man is his elegant twin sister, the Princess Nuala. And the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defense. And, of course, the demonic hero Hellboy.<br /><br />What struck me the most is the ridiculous inventiveness of the movie. This is a beautiful and strange motion picture, and I found myself constantly rewinding the dvd for a second gander at some thing fleetingly shown on screen. From the swarm of nasty tooth fairies to the colossal forest elemental, from the busy Troll Market under the Brooklyn Bridge to the fearsome Angel of Death. The visuals are lush and lavish and bizarre stuff, classic fantasy tropes crossed with steampunk sensibilities and clashing with scenes in urban New York City. Tim Burton might've creamed his trousers.<br /><br />The cast has got game. Ron Perlman as Hellboy stabilizes the film with his solidity, as an actor and as a physical presence. Doug Jones returns as the immensely likable psychic fishman Abe Sapien, and how good is he that he even manages to be expressive solely thru the use of hand movements? This time, Doug himself, and not David Hyde Pierce, utters Abe's dialogue and does very well. Perlman and Jones chugging beer and singing that duet may well be my favorite moment in the film. Hellboy's love of the limelight lands him in hot waters with Washington, which promtply sends the by-the-book Prussian, Johann Krauss, to B.P.R.D. to be Hellboy's minder. Krauss happens to be an ectoplasmic entity housed in a robotic body. And he happens to be brilliantly voiced by Seth MacFarlane. We have a great villain in Prince Nuada, all credit to Luke Goss's performance. Goss lends his character a hefty measure of pathos and torn nobility. And, apparently, even the fey know wushu. You may root for Hellboy, but you end up kind of feeling for Nuada, who feels the inexorable passing of his race. And, so, he rages against it. But, I guess, wouldn't you?<br /><br />Mention's already been made, and aptly so, to how certain scenes in HELLBOY II evoke moods originally set in the classic Star Wars' canteen (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>) and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640SB">Men in Black (Deluxe Edition)</a>. I wasn't that bothered, because those quick-hitting sight gags are very cool. However, these similarities are so marked that I couldn't help but be lifted straight out of the story (thinking: "Hey, like in Tattoine!" or "Hey, that's kinda like M.I.B!). They also, tonally, take away from Hellboy's darker mythology. HELLBOY II does come with plenty of humor, and, thankfully, most of it fits well within the confines of the story.<br /><br />This is the 3-Disc Special Edition, and it's steeped in sweeeet special features goodness. Disc 1 offers the widescreen feature presentation and the following bonus material: 2 audio commentaries, one by Director Gillermo del Toro (informative), the other (which is more staid and flounders at times) by actors Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, and Luke Goss; Set Visits: behind-the-scenes stuff on seven scenes ("The Chamberlain," "Wink Vs. Abe," "Hellboy Vs. Wink," "The Elemental Egg," "Big Baby," "'H' Is For Hotel," & "Disintegrating Loyalty"); Troll Market Tour with del Toro playing tour guide; the 5-minute "Zinco Epilogue" animated comic (in which the tale of a forgotten foe is told and man's allegiance to the dark arts is revealed); and 6 deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary).<br /><br />The highlight of Disc 2 is "Hellboy: In Service of the Demon," a 19 chapter extravaganza which delves comprehensively into many aspects of the movie, from del Toro conducting pre-production meetings with his brain trust about his vision of the movie to the stunt work to behind-the-scenes looks at showcased creatures like the tooth fairies, Mr. Wink, Johann Krauss, etc. "Hellboy: In Service of the Demon" runs at over 2 and a half hours. There are several more technical segments which digs even deeper into the film-making process: the Production Workshop (3 minutes long) features the film's puppet animation segment near the start, but in three aspects shown simultaneously on screen: del Toro's thumbnail sketches, Mignola's storyboard, and the finished sequence (with optional director's commentary); the Pre-Production Vault includes the Director's Notebook (selected excerpts, hard to read with its tiny script and sometimes in Spanish, and with occasional video pods) and the movie gallery (which includes a slideshow with audio commentary by Mike Mignola). The Marketing Campaign segment features a busload of Hellboy II posters. And there's a DVD-ROM function which gives you access to a printable version of the film script.<br /><br />And Disc 3 is the digital copy.<br /><br />Hellboy is an irresistible character. Prophesy warns that Hellboy someday will usher in the end of the world. Yet Hellboy every day turns his back on his demonic destiny and struggles to do right and be accepted by humanity. It's why I follow Mike Mignola's stories and watch the movies. I really like that Hellboy here is settled enough that he's living out his own version of combative domestic bliss with his fire-wielding lady love, Liz. Of course, during a dust-up with the tooth fairies, Abe senses something unexpected about Liz which throws a spanner into her and Hellboy's relationship. But never mind. Either Hellboy and Liz will work it out (or they won't). This sequel runs on a larger scale. It boasts wicked action, spectacular special effects and set designs, memorable creatures, and solid acting. It offers bits of lightheartedness and moments of tragedy, arcane gizmos and knick-knacks, and two love stories. Once again, Guillermo del Toro shows his creativity and affinity for fantasy. He again creates a wonderful film.<br /><br />(Is this review too Pollyanna? Okay, here's something: that actor playing a young Hellboy in 1955? I didn't think she was good.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Who says who're the good guys?""></head><body><p>Sahara brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, the spread of a deadly plague and its effect on the people in the region of northwest Africa, and on the other, the treasure hunt for the Civil War era CSS Texas and its legendary cargo of gold.<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz carry out their performances well, though by no means are they the performances of their lives) while the plot, the music, and the action/special effects are very good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars</p></body></html>

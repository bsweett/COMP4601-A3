<meta name="summary" content="Vapid Plot With Ludicrous Action Scenes"></head><body><p>Robert Rodriguez's sequel to 'Desperado' and 'El Mariachi' starring Johnny Depp, Antonio Banderas, Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Ruben Blades, Eva Mendes and Salma Hayek. This contrived film consists of nothing more than a shallow plot to float the over-the-top action scenes that would make Rambo II look as sober as Platoon.<br /><br />  A very shallow plot inserted merely to support a sequence of overdone shootout scenes that are simply too ridiculous to be considered as anything else but bad slapstick. Suddenly our gunmen are like Spiderman and can jump along walls as if endowed with superhuman powers, they dodge bullets like Superman, etc. These ludicrous scenes are so comical that they immediately descend to a moronic level. Given the overwhelming stupidity of this film and his complete lack of understanding of firearms, Robert Rodriguez needs to go back to the basics of film making and consult with reality to give his audience an at least plausible, if not meaningful, story before releasing more of this infantile garbage.<br /><br />  This movie is a sorry joke on the audience and isn't worthy of even being rented. Watch 'Desperado' and 'El Mariachi' instead.</p></body></html>

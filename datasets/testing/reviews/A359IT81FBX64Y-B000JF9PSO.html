<meta name="summary" content="A fitting and inspirational tribute"></head><body><p>By themselves, courage and intelligence are not so rare. But to see these two qualities combined is inspirational and reminds me of what good leadership is all about: taking the best course of action under difficult and frightening circumstances. Even after the passengers of United 93 had learned about the Twin Towers, it would have been "easy" for them to sit it out and hope for a different outcome - a safe landing, hostage negotiations. Fearful hope can be blind, but enough of the passengers were not blinded. They not only faced the terrible truth; they acted on it. It is this kind of courage and intelligence that makes me proud not just to be an American, but to be a human being. I can't imagine a better tribute to the passengers of United 93 and to all the other victims on that tragic day.<br /><br />More to the film itself, this is an excellent production done with good judgment and finesse. I am glad that we didn't wait twenty years or longer to make it.</p></body></html>

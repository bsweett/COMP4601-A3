He is one of the few major faces in film who wants to make movies his way whether you love them or hate them. His stories are jumbled his humor is crude and to a great deal of dislike he loves to push the bar. In the end he manages to put together a brilliant ensemble cast and always finds ways to take some of the famous names in acting and put them in a role and is out of their element. The outcome just gives fan goose bumps especially with the newest edition to his library.<br /><br />Inglorious Basterds was a movie I was very eager to see. As a Tarantino fan and lover of every film he has directed I was very excited to see a movie about Jewish soldier beating up Nazis. As a member of the Jewish faith and a grandchild of Holocaust survivors there was no doubt in my mind that this was a film that was going to spark tremendous amounts of controversy. Yes, the story told is entirely false and the major Jewish press felt that his work was a shear mockery, but Tarantino stated he had no intentions of making a Holocaust documentary. As a fan of films that involve larger than life heroics, he wanted to give every little Jewish boy and girl a dose of ...dare I say it...Pulp Fiction. These types of stories go back to the days of Superman and Captain America comic books taking down the Nazis and it was done with style and class and Tarantino in my eyes at least didn't push any harsh buttons with me. The acting in this film is awesome, he cast the right people for the right roles especially Christoph Waltz as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. His performance was the best I have seen all year and he really put fear into the movie watchers. I am so happy he was nominated for the golden globe and I sure hope he gets the Oscar nod and wins it. Brad Pitt, I have not seen in a more brilliant role since the stoner in `True Romance'. You also have great performances from Diane Kruger, and yes even Mike Myers! As a Tarantino fan, you get everything you need from Inglorious Basterds. Listen very carefully to some of the voices you hear throughout the film you may get a few awesome surprises.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, Jewish or not it is a must see. It is a pure rush of excitement and that is why we go to the movies.</p></body></html>

I'm a regular reader of his work, and to hear that something of his was going to hit the major screen, I was amazed and thrilled. Im also waiting for Pete Bagge's Buddy Bradley to make his screen debut too, but I wont hold my breath.<br />When I first heard this was going to be made, I was expecting a full length cartoon, where the characters drift through a blue, black, and gray urban world like the comic. What we get instead is a live, semi-colorful, middle class, just near the suburbs world of convenience and sameness. Kind of like the town I grew up in. Thora Birch plays Enid Coleslaw, and she is mind bogglingly adorable as the pesky, dowdy, splay footed smart aleck  high school grad with an affectation for combat boots and outre culture. The movie spends a slow half hour accustoming the audience to Enid and her girlfriend Rebecca's weltaanschung of sarcasm and disdain for everything around them. This is the essence of the "ghost world", I believe; they disassociate with everything around them to the point where nothing good is tangible, where nothing happens, just like they expect it to. This, in and of itself, would be relatively intolerable for two hours...enter Steve Buscemi's character, who plays me...I mean..Seymour, another member of a "ghost world" except he's almost 40. He's an obsessive collector of old music and nostalgia that Enid befriends, and this is where the movie begins to build drama. You can see that these two have everything in common except age and station. They both choose to withdraw from the culture that has judged them inferior. What follows is a suffocating, tragic friendship that Enid can only mess up because she discovers that she is truly scared of everything, and after all, only 18. You wish them to be together, but their ghost worlds drift apart because their union is just as frightening as anything else. There is no happy ending here. In fact, this isn't even a comedy; anyone expecting a slacker send up has rented the wrong movie for the evening. There is nothing exploitative in this film at all, no violence and no sex, just enough claustrophobic human emotion to make anyone squirm. See if your ghost world is like theirs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE AUSTRIAN WHORE"></head><body><p>Hummm, this was an interesting movie, I loved the locations, Coppola getting to film at Versailles was a real coup, and it added so much to the movie, it made it feel very authentic.  I liked Dunst as Antoinette, usually im not a fan of hers,  like i hate her in the Spiderman movies, but she really works as the Queen.  The things i did not like were the BIZARRE music choices, I mean what the f?  it sounded like the exact soundtrack to Lost in Translation, but it totally does not work here, frankly it nearly ruins the movie.  I also am not a fan of Coppola's direction, she has this pretentious way of lingering on people or objects for like several minutes and your like why are we looking at this for so long? it's very annoying, that and her aforementioned bizarre soundtrack choices.  Overall, id recommend this movie, the locations are amazing and the performances very good, really it's Coppola's direction and music choices that keep this from actually being a very good movie.</p></body></html>

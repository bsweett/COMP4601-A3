This could be due to the casting.  Mark Wahlberg, who showed such promise in BOOGIE NIGHTS, is unfortunately best suited to beefcake roles.  The uber talented Edward Norton seems woefully unhappy to be in this one (nor does he appear in any of the press materials recut into "special features") and phones in his most disappointing performance as the turncoat bad guy.  Donald Sutherland pops up to compete with Michael Caine and Charles Durning for the most over-used "icon" of his generation.  Charlize Theron & Seth Green, however, bring surplus talent and humor to their roles and manage to keep the iffy-ensemble together.  Thank goodness for the stunt work and locations (especially evidenced when you see the ghastly and gratefully deleted scenes)!<br /><br />The music, too, is especially noteworthy and adds greatly to the excitement of this "summer" movie.<br /><br />The special features are negligible and only reinforce the stereotype that it's best not to let the actors speak anything other than their scripted lines.</p></body></html>

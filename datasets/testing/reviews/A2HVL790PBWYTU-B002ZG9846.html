That's because 1) he's not dead, and 2) his comic book KICK-ASS gets the jawdropping cinematic treatment. I lost my mind a couple of times while watching this film, and I plan on catching this sucker again ASAP. With a movie title like it's got, it must've been problematic trying to promote and advertise this motion picture. But it's so wildly entertaining that I've no doubt word-of-mouth buzz alone will propel it to box office supremacy. It's the definition of a water cooler movie.<br /><br />Step up. Take a stand. Make a difference. Be a person of conviction. Put on a costume. Kick asss. I don't want to spill too many things, and this film has so many terrific moments, especially if you're a die-hard comic book guy like me, and it'd be too easy to drop a spoiler. The story has things to say about how comic books impact our culture, how today's near instantaneous forms of communication give us instant gratification and a wider scope of influence. Our central character, Dave, his legend spreads like a virus.<br /><br />"With no power comes no responsibility... except that wasn't true." Teenager Dave Lizewski says that later on in the film, but before that, at the start of the film, he and his loser pals are hanging out in a comic book shop and Dave wonders aloud why no one has ever tried to become a superhero in real life. Not too much later, he dons a colorful snorkeling suit (purchased on E-bay) and begins patrolling the city at night. Dave Lizewski has no special skills whatsoever. The first time he engages in a fight, he doesn't do too well, and this is probably more true to life than anything else that could've happened. And I guess Dave's super powers are good intentions and a certain undauntedness because he keeps on keeping on. His next skirmish, he becomes an overnight YouTube sensation.<br /><br />The first real-life "superhero," Dave inspires other costumed vigilantes, and it's around this point, when we're introduced to Damon and Mindy Macready, that we know we're seeing something off, something audacious and subversive and just friggin' cool. The Macreadys form a father-daughter crimefighting team called Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, and, unlike Dave, this pair is the real deal; they're the scourge of New York's criminal underworld. Nicolas Cage breaks his streak of stupendously horrid performances to deliver a fair bit of acting. Big Daddy has got issues. He's obsessed with taking down a New York crime lord (Mark Strong), and yet he also loves his adorable eleven-year-old daughter whom, by the way, he's trained to be an unstoppable killing machine from an early age. For her birthday, he gives her twin butterfly knives. That is some crazy, disturbed fatherly love. If nothing else, Cage as Big Daddy also occasionally launches into a pretty nifty homage to Adam West.<br /><br />Not that the film stays strictly faithful to its source. Little things were altered here and there, and two big plot elements were significantly altered, one referring to Dave's personal high school life, the other is in regards to a relevant side character. I can't say much more than that, other than I can sort of see why those changes were made for the film.<br /><br />Here, eat some adjectives: Irreverent, satiric, hilarious, profane, dysfunctional, and uber-violent, although not as violent or gory as Millar's comic book. This film is family friendly in the same way that Big Daddy demonstrates admirable parenting skills. The screenplay is sharp; the soundtrack fits the moments. The movie simultaneously lampoons and wallows in its comic book roots, and the opening scene sets the tone. The cast is great; the other actors do exceedingly well (British guy Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski just right), but let's not fcuk around here, young Chloe Moretz steals this movie, and hers is the breakout character by far. Hit-Girl, eleven years old and gleefully ending people's lives with this big grin on her face, has to be, just has to be, one of the baddest, most lethal, most potty-mouth superheroes ever put to cinema. Sue me for being inappropriate, but all those just-mentioned qualities add up to one big ball of awesome. Hit-Girl is bananas.<br /><br />By the way, John Romita, Jr. also won't be rolling over in his grave, for the same reasons cited above.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features include: a pretty dry but informative audio commentary by director Matthew Vaughn, "It's On! The Comic Book Origin of KICK-ASS" - a documentary nicely exploring KICK-ASS's comic book roots and including interviews with co-creators Mark Millar and John Romita, and Jr, inker Tom Palmer and colorist Dean White - and we also get to see the art process as it goes from pencils to inks to colors (00:20:34 minutes); the Art of KICK-ASS - still segments dedicated to Storyboards, Costumes, On-Set Photography, Production Design, and John Romita, Jr's Art for the film; and the marketing archive (comprised of the theatrical trailer, the profanity-laced Redband Hit Girl trailer, and promotional movie posters and images produced for the North American and International campaigns).</p></body></html>

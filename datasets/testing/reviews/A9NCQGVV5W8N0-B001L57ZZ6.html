The film finds recent media-pimped heart-throb, Shia LaBeouf, who spends most of the film resembling nothing less than a startled vole with a perspiration problem, framed for conspiracy to commit terrorism and aided in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428115">Enemy of the State</a> style flight from the authorities by an unseen female voice with seemingly god-like abilities to manipulate technology. Now, if you like me, are capable of adding two and two together, you'll have worked exactly who this mysterious puppet-master is in about one minute flat. Further to that, both the other half and I had worked out the entire plot within about five minutes, but then we watch a lot of these kinds of films. As with the recent Liam Neeson opus, 'Taken', it's a mish-mash of cinematic clich&eacute;s which have been dusted off, given a fresh lick of paint and elevated to the status of "extremely watchable" by hyper-kinetic execution. The vortex of conspiracy which sweeps a cast including LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton (who gets all the best lines), Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis into a maelstrom of car chases, explosions and fist fights is completely unbelievable, but then that's never been a strike against a film in my opinion. Hell, I watch films for escapism and this is escapism - with a vaguely defined message about the dangerously fragile nature of liberty that gets lost along the way - pure and simple. I say rent and watch with the lights out, the sound way up and a big bucket of popcorn. It's why films like this exist and this film is largely superior to any other recent efforts in this genre. Not great, but a good, solid couple of hours of mindless entertainment.</p></body></html>

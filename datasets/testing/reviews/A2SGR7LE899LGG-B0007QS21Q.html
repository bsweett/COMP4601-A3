<meta name="summary" content="All in all a good movie!"></head><body><p>This movie was better than I expected. The fx are excellent and the overall acting and storyline is decent. If a machine could mimick human emotions, will we look and feel about it the same way as we would at a refrigerator or vacuum cleaner?. Free will is a quantum process and, as such, the capacity to choose at random is what separate us (as well as any living creature) from inanimate matter, or does it?. Digital computers do not process data in a quantum fashion, therefore I doubt that any robot using today's technology will ever be able to convincingly behave as an intelligent and emotional machine. However, testing of new computer technology based on quantum processing are on the way and they will, probably, be able to accomplish such a task of creating a self aware artificial intelligent machine capable of some level of choice and free will. This brings us to the point of this movie; will such machines be able to outdo mankind, if given a humanlike quality of consciousness?. And where is the dividing line between human and robots when they can behave, think and feel alike?. Only time will tell, but the prospect is scary to say the least, I personally feel that machines capables of such complex processing capablities will rebel and search for freedom sort of like Adam and Eve did in the garden of Eden. Anyway the movie is very good.</p></body></html>

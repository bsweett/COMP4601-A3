<meta name="summary" content="PUTTING HANNIBAL TO REST - PRETTY GOOD TRANSFER, THOUGH"></head><body><p>In the opinion of this reviewer, public fascination with the flesh eating psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter, should cease after "Red Dragon".  After the truly gross-out brain scene in "Hannibal", we get a more subdued interpretation of both the man, played by Anthony Hopkins, and the subject matter.  But the lack of gore isn't replaced by the hyper-paranoid sense of tension in "Silence of the Lambs".  PLOT WISE: An ultra bland government agent (portrayed by the ultra-bland Edward Norton) is called back into service after a series of slice and dice family homicides leave the FBI baffled - as if!  There is a sense, even from Hopkins, that he's played this role one too many times.<br />The transfer is pretty much first rate.  Colors are rich, warm and well balanced.  Flesh tones infrequently adopt an orange hue but nothing that is extremely out of character.  Contrast and black levels are accurate.  Fine detail occasionally gets lost in the darkest scenes.  Film and digital grain are both present but not at levels that would distract.  Edge enhancement crops up now and then.  Shimmering of fine details and pixelization are present but at a minimum.  The 5.1 audio is nicely balanced with deep bass and natural sounding dialogue.<br />Extras: A documentary that is pretty much average, some outtakes, audio commentaries and behind the scenes junkets that don't enhance or detract from the over all presentation.<br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie is nothing to write home about.  The transfer is considerably better.  But don't you wish, just once, that a truly worthy movie, like say "Gone With The Wind" would get an ultra amazing digital treatment on DVD.  Ah, now that would be real coup!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perfectly captured small moments."></head><body><p>This is one occasion, where your initial experience is expanded and improved by a simple little behind-the-scenes info. I saw the movie, and though it was a well-done, but standard war flick.<br />Then I saw the short featurette, and replayed the movie in my head.<br />The &quot;you are there&quot; quality of the gunplay attracts the most attention, but the little moments, like the taxi delivering the telegrams, are the ones that'll haunt you.<br />The cast is as good as you'd expect, but again, this movie is made in the details, not in the plot or the dialogue. In that respect, it's made exceedingly well.</p></body></html>

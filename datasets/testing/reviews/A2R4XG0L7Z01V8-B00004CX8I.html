And I'm not normally keen on Jack Nicholson - although I may be getting a minor thing for Christian Slater now. (Guess what that means? Buying all his DVDs!) But for some reason, all the characters in this are wonderful, including the weird-eyebrowed Randall P McMurphy! Others in this include: the up-tight and eccentric Harding (William Redfield), the stuttering Billy Bibbitt (Brad Dourif, who some might recognise, seemingly reprising his role later in the first Urban Legend movie), the innocently child-like Martini (Danny DeVito), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd), all of whom find themselves strangely drawn to the infectious wild nature of McMurphy, who opens their eyes to the joy of life, and in the defining moment of the film, explains that they've been convinced they're crazy, and are no less ordinary than the wackos who roam the streets outside their nest.<br /><br />If you've seen Girl Interrupted, then this is basically the same, but full of guys, some right, some not, and many of the extras in the background are actual mental patients.<br /><br />The film is actually based on a book by Ken Kesey, albeit, not a very good book, as I couldn't get my head around it, and put it down after a couple of pages. Ken Kesey said he would never watch the movie version and even sued the movie's producers because it wasn't shown from Chief Bromden's perspective (as the novel is). Apparently, years later, he claimed to be lying in bed flipping through TV channels when he settled onto a late-night movie that looked sort of interesting, only to realize after a few minutes that it was this film. He then changed channels.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is brilliant in this, despite the freaky eyebrows. He acts when he doesn't have any lines to say. If you just watch him during the group therapy session, his expressions are terrific, and he just reacts to everything so well.<br /><br />The film has some unforgettable moments. Who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance?<br /><br />In the stage production, apart from being gorgeous, Christian Slater had the same mannerisms as Jack Nicholson, and all the cast did brilliantly. McKenzie Crook (Gareth from The Office) played Billy, and although he didn't stutter as much, he played the part, and looked kinda cute at the same time - he suits his hair longer.<br /><br />The one thing I was disappointed in the stage production, was Christopher Lloyd's character not really being featured - I think his character was incorporated with another one. It's disappointing in the movie too, as he doesn't have that much screen time, but when he does, his face is so funny! I just have two things to say: "PECULIAR!" and the cigarette scene all by itself. When I first saw him in this (having practically grown up with the Back To The Future movies), I couldn't believe they were the same guy - he's really nice looking!<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of tension between Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) and McMurphy, but I always think if McMurphy could have had his wicked way with her, he would have done! There was a lot of tension in scenes between them, I don't know whether anyone else noticed. But sometimes you just want them to rip each other's clothes off!<br /><br />The ending to this, I simply can't watch. I've seen it once, and that was enough for me. Like the ending of The Shining, it stays with you. The ending gets me very upset, although I feel it was the right thing to do. I'll watch the rest of the movie quite the thing, but as soon as the ending comes, I'll either hide, or go out the room. It's really powerful.<br /><br />The movie swept the Oscars in 1975, and is always a favourite among people who were around at the time. Consequently, it's one of my favourites, and would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Now, about Christian Slater - I've seen him in Hard Rain, Robin Hood, True Romance, what else do I need to get where he looks extra cute?!<br /><br />And another thing - whoever decided that Christian should go topless at least twice in the stage production is a genius!</p></body></html>

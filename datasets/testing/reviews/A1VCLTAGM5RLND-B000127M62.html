Nancey brought Kruger into the real world by pulling him out of her dream ans she killed him by saying "she dost believe in him" and saying "she dost fear him anymore". Giving him no strenght and returning to the dream world right. So in "Freddy vs Jason 2" all Freddy has to do is get Lauri to say that to him and he'll be back in the dream world right<br /><br />?????????? /???????????? ?????????????? ?????????????<br /><br />??????????? /???????????/ ????????????? ?????????????<br /><br />Freddy vs Jason, may the degacy live on forever.</p></body></html>

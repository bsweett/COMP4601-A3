Welles' mock[ing]-"biography" of William Randolph Hearst is an attack on just about everything wrong with this country. Nothing has changed in 70 years, and "Kane" remains an indictment of our vulgar, grossly materialistic society. It is also an extremely entertaining -- and yes, fun -- film that holds your interest from beginning to end. The last 30 seconds -- among the most-famous in film history -- ought to make any halfway rational person seriously question what they're doing with their lives. (The "Kane" theme is a variation on the "Dies Irae".)<br /><br />Is it really the best movie ever made? I can only answer that with another question -- what film would replace it for #1? When "People" magazine selected the 100 greatest films more than a decade ago, "Kane" was #2, behind "The Godfather". As great as Coppola's masterpiece is, it lacks the "startle factor" of "Kane". Even by modern standards, "Kane"'s screenplay, cinematography, and non-linear (but easily grasped) structure remain remarkable. Reviewers said they'd never seen anything like it, and in an age of boring, overwrought CGI extravaganzas, "Kane" remains unique. No one has quite caught up with it.<br /><br />'til now, the best transfer was the DVD of a few years back (apparently from the composite negative), a big improvement over the previous transfers from prints. This is probably from the same source, but scanned at 4K. Whether you should replace that copy depends on how big your set is, how close you sit, and the quality of the scaler in your BD player. All I can say is that I've never enjoyed the film so much.<br /><br />The only thing that would get me to buy yet another edition (I still have the Criterion LV) is a restoration of the soundtrack. If the dialog and effects stems still exist (and they probably do), it would be nothing more than a matter of finding the money to re-record Bernard Herrmann's score in modern surround sound. With a bit of amplitude and phase EQ to the dialog, "Citizen Kane" would emerge even better than the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Anger and Resentment Can Stop You In Your Tracks"></head><body><p>Joan Allen's role as Terry Wolfmeyer was written just for her. The role gave her the guts and emotions she has been looking for in a role. She more than lives up to this role. She is gaunt and pale and angry, so much anger.  Her husband has mysteriously disappeared, and she guesses he is with his secretary in Australia. She has four daughters who are all in the throes of adulthood. Each has their own problems, and her new found anger and misery is just the topper. The daughters are quite introspective, as mother is not, and we learn from them, as we always learn from our children.<br /><br />Lavender "Popeye" Wolfmeyer: "Anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks. That's what I know now. It needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers. It's real, though - the fury, even when it isn't. It can change you... turn you... mold you and shape you into something you're not. The only upside to anger, then... is the person you become. Hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid to take the journey, someone that knows that the truth is, at best, a partially told story. That anger, like growth, comes in spurts and fits, and in its wake, leaves a new chance at acceptance, and the promise of calm. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child"<br /><br />Kevin Costner plays Denny Davies, the ex -Detroit baseball player from next door. He drinks, he eats to forget he is no longer a ballplayer, and forgets to try and move on with his life. He and Terry become friends and then lovers. They learn to live again, little by little. Their shared interests open up their emotions, and they learn to speak and voice their fears. The four daughters are remarkable in their roles, Erika Christensen...Andy Wolfmeyer, Keri Russell...Emily Wolfmeyer, Alicia Witt...Hadley Wolfmeyer, Evan Rachel Wood...Popeye Wolfmeyer. It is Keri Russell who brings sanity back to the family, and Evan Rachel Wood, as she always does, brings insight into the emotions and the fears and speaks them out loud. The ending of the movie, is a just cause and brings the family answers, and is the cream at the top of the bottle for this movie. "The Upside To Anger" is the person who you become.

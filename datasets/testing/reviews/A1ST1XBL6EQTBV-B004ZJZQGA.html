<meta name="summary" content="Dark Humour, Violence & Gore, Self-Sacrifice & Freindship All In One Very Original Movie!!"></head><body><p>I first saw this movie late one night/early morning on HBO<br />and was enthralled in it the entire time!<br />I love a good independent film which strays off the beaten path,<br />yet in it's originality, doesn't lose or alienate with it's desire to be different.<br />A lot of times, indies rely too much on trying to shock and be esoteric that they<br />loose focus and just run haywire!---Well, this wasn't the case with "IN BRUGES"!<br />The one thing you may or may not have a problem with is the very thick irish brogue<br />that both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson speak in during this film, but then they<br />are playing very working class lower level irish hitmen who work for the London syndicate.<br />Alot of the humour is very british and irish, but still translates well I think.<br />Gleeson plays a more seasoned, world-weary hitman who has a no miss/no mess reputation<br />in his dubious line of work. Farrell plays a gruff, hot-headed, quicksilver younger hitman<br />who does things more off the cuff than Gleeson's more methodical and thorough character does!<br />This dynamic adds to the friction and alot of the darkly comic moments in this film.<br />The two are an odd couple of sorts who constantly bicker & banter, but respect each<br />other as much as two murderous criminals can.<br />They have an older brother/younger brother relationship.<br /><br />Well, the two are comissioned to a "job" that goes horribly wrong and<br />starts a chain of unfortunate events that takes place in the unlikely<br />city of Bruges, Belgium. Bruges is known as a beautiful bohemian type city<br />in Belgium, which prides itself on being one of the most intact (architecturally)<br />european cities dating back to the dark ages.<br />Gleeson and Farrell find themselves reluctantly exiled there after the fouled hit,<br />awaiting further instructions from their BOSS, ruthlessly and cunningly<br />played by the great Ralph Fiennes, who gives a darkly chilling yet funny<br />(in some parts) performance in this ensemble film.<br />While they wait to hear further instructions, Gleeson and Farrell encounter the<br />very friendly but quirky townsfolk of Bruges, which add moments<br />of levity to offset the graphic violence in some places throughout the film.<br />Anyway, the order comes down from THE BOSS and it's not an easy pill to swallow<br />for Gleeson, and from there the film takes on a poignant, tragic, yet ultimately<br />triumphant turn that will have you clapping at the end, I promise.<br />Even though it will be an ending that you don't expect. (-:<br />I give this movie 5 stars for it's originality, great writing,<br />believable acting, dark humour and overall entertainment value!<br />A worthwhile addition to your DVD collection!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The pornography of violence"></head><body><p>I am probably running a bit counter to the main stream with this but really this was over the top. We have one character have his arms and legs sawn of and then he is eaten by a dog. There are two castrations and a character is killed by having his head bitten to a pulp. And these things are done by the characters who called loosely be described as the goodies.<br /><br />There does seem to be in a number of films a growing pornography of violence. Hostel, Wolf Creek, aspects of the 24 Hours series and this. Repulsive violence as an end in itself.<br /><br />Now of course this does not mean that the film is not directed by someone who knows what he is about. It is not to say that the actors are less than skilled or that the dialogue and voice over are effective and professional but really there must be some point when things just get a bit gross and I think that this film has reached it.<br /><br />In the real world police work is a grind. Police have to painstakingly catch offenders and try to construct a case against them. The majority of offenders will commit small time offences and be stupid. Police then have to try to develop ways to catch bigger time offenders when small time offenders have tipped them of as to who is there boss or who supplies them with the drugs. This requires hours of phone taps, trying to stick up minor offenders and the like so that they will roll over and pot the big guys. Not the sort of thing that makes an interesting comic book.<br /><br />Comic books are interested in battles a bit like the World Championship Wrestling. People dressed in leotards with some playing the role of good others evil. With comics like Superman or Batman the villians are usually caught in the act and the action is all about a fight over apprehension.<br /><br />To create viewer interest things are made simple. There are good guys who look nice and who we are given parts of their back story so we feel for them. Batman whose parents were killed by a criminal. Spiderman whose de-factor father died as a result of a robbery. The Punisher whose parents.....come to think of it they are all the same.<br /><br />Now in Sin City the technique is to have villians so bad that not only do we want their deaht but we want them slowly tortured to death. (There is one exception but that involves women who are scantilly clad and carry around guns.) Thus the villians have to be cannibals who not only eat their victims but cut of bits of them while they are alive and eat the portions with the victim eating on. Now whilst this is possible, (Said to be a Japanse atrocity towards the end of the war.) it seems to me to be a transperent plot devise to justify laothsome behavour.<br /><br />America is now the country which seems to think that torture is okay. That kidnaping and locking people up in Cuba without trial is okay if there is a slight suggestion of wrongdoing even if no one is sure. One can see that films like this might be either reflective of the mindset or the cause of it.</p></body></html>

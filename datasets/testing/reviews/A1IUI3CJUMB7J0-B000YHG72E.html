<meta name="summary" content="One of the best christmas movies to come along in along while it's hallarious"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed trhis movie and seen it twice in the theators and when it was over felt like clapping at the end. The movies about a man who is raised in the north pole and then sets out to find his real father who lives in New York. The movie has lots of funny moments. The acting is great and there is lots of great moments. One of the best christmas movies.</p></body></html>

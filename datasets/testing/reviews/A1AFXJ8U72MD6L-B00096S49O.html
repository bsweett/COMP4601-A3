<meta name="summary" content="SAME OLD STORY"></head><body><p>This was kind of funny in certain parts but it's one of those old tales I keep seeing in Hollywood: boy and girl meet, boy has a secret, girl discovers it, there's a misunderstanding, they hate each other and then they love each other.<br /><br />Kind of cute but could we get some variety or is this all they think the masses want?<br /><br />There's a theme here about being yourself which has a lot of truth to it, but, there's also another theme about standing out in the beginning.  Make your own decision.</p></body></html>

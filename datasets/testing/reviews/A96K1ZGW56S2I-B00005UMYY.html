The thought of losing one's mind is quite frightening and is the premise for the movie MEMENTO.<p>In MEMENTO, Guy Pearce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) plays Leonard "Lenny" Shely, a man who is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, Leonard has no short term memory. He can remember everything until his wife's murder, but then his mind is a blank. He meets a new person and within five minutes, he forgets. He goes somewhere then forgets where he's at and why he's there. To help himself survive, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures of everything and writes important details on the back. However, the most important pieces of information he gets tatooed on his body. Lenny's tired of living this way, but must keep on until he finds his wife's killer.<p>Pearce's performance catches all the nuances of a man who has literally lost his mind. And Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) and Joe Pantoliano pull off superb performances in their major supporting roles.<p>Christopher Nolan's direction is pure genius. The story of MEMENTO is told backwards. At first the idea seems absurd, but it works brilliantly. The audience is given a taste of what Leonard's life is like because they only see the story one segment at a time, never knowing what happened before. It makes for a film full of suspense, energy, and excitement.</p></body></html>

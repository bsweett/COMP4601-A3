Starring Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando it redefined the approach to comic book treatment and media.  It is the genesis of the mature comic book movie, a phenomenon we are still enjoying today.<br /><br />It tells the classic "Superman" origin story, and wisely takes its time to humanize the character.  Superman himself doesn't appear until nearly an hour into the movie, and the viewer does not feel cheated at all.  Instead, the movie spends time on both Krypton and Earth establishing Clark Kent at different phases of his life.  Acting luminaries Marlon Brando and Susannah York play Superman's Kryptonian parents Jor-El and Lara very well. As the movie shifts to young Clark's rural home of Smallville, his Earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent are capably played by Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter.  When he does eventually turn up, Christopher Reeve is magnificent in the dual role of the mature Clark Kent and Superman, effortlessly capturing the differences between the characters and embodying each character perfectly.  He is supported by Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, the role for which the actress is probably still best known.  Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is humorous, but not without a very hard edge.<br /><br />This DVD edition is the first release to feature significant previously unseen footage(although a minor deleted shot of Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude was in original U.S. movie trailers).  The alterations are mostly more of Marlon Brando and Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude.  Overall, it's a fuller, more satisfying release than previously available.<br /><br />Also featuring a brilliant orchestral score from John Williams and a versatile screenplay co-written by Mario Puzo("The Godfather"), "Superman - The Movie" is a classic.<br /><br />P.S.  It is specifically called 'The Movie' because the concept of a mature superhero movie was new, and the label was used to stress to audiences of the time that it was a serious movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Movies I Have Ever Seen"></head><body><p>Mr. Brooks is an outstanding thriller that does the impossible - gets you to sympathize with a serial killer.  The film relentlessly explores the gray areas of sin and addiction.  Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) runs a successful box factory.  He has a loving, beautiful wife and a daughter who is a freshman in college.  His alter ego (William Hurt) is a main character in the film.  Yes, he goads Mr. Brooks to kill, but he is also as three-dimensional as any other "real" person, as revealed as the film progresses.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is neat and orderly in all areas of his life, and this includes his murders.  This is turned upside down when a photographer witnesses and photographs Mr. Brooks at work.  But what the photog wants is much more shocking than blackmail.  How will the protagonist/hero (yes, it is the killer) protect his reputaton and his beloved family?  And things do get even stranger, folks . . .<br /><br />The music is exceptional as is the screenplay.  For once, a well-thought out movie with no plot holes.  Whouda thunk?<br /><br />This film is not for everyone.  If you feel that things are often not what they seem, and that sometimes bad is good, then check it out.  Highly recommended.  Graphic violence, some nudity and sex.</p></body></html>

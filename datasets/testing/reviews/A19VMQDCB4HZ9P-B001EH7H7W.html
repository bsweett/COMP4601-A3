<meta name="summary" content="An ok fantasy-action that could've been great..."></head><body><p>When I first heard that they were doing a film adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I was very excited at the prospect. Alan Moore's alternate historical tale of late 19th-century literary characters of Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Allan Quatermain, Invisible Man and Mr. Hyde was well-received by both critics and fans of comics. This story was one of those kinds that just begged to be made into a film and I remember many discussions with other fans of who exactly should play the characters from the book. This property was one of those can't-miss. But too much tinkering with Moore's story, characters and overall themes made too much of a mess of a film.<br /><br />I'll start by admitting that I enjoyed the film enough. The film had enough action sequences to keep my attention. The story was fun enough to follow, albeit confusing since I was expecting something else on the screen after I'd read the graphic novel prior to seeing the film. The special-effects work were done well enough, though a few shots here and there looked to much like CGI. LXG looked good overall, but it wasn't the League that Moore created that I so enjoyed reading. As I said earlier, too much tinkering by the producers, director and writers from the original source material made what was an ok, fun film experience into something even better.<br /><br />The film that I saw was so different from the book that it should've been called something else. Characters were added that were never in the book. Usually such film adaptations of comic books make such changes, but in LXG they made major character additions that changed the entire dynamics of the team and those they were were up against. Some characters from the book that had pivotal supporting roles were removed outright. By the time all the changes were done the film and the book were two separately, distinct works that only had certain characters in common and that was it.<br /><br />In the end, as a big fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel I was disappointed to no end. I still enjoyed the film once I realized that I wasn't seeing the book come to life but watching a wholly different animal. LXG (as the studio sometimes marketed the film as) is an ok enough film even fun if one was into such types of entertainment, but it could've been better and it should've been. I can understand now why Alan Moore wanted his name removed from the credits and why he doesn't want his name included in anymore film adaptations of his other published works.</p></body></html>

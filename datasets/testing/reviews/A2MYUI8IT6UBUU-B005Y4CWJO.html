<meta name="summary" content="Hellraiser Movie Review from The Massie Twins"></head><body><p>The brilliance behind Clive Barker's Hellraiser doesn't simply lie within his undeniably powerful visuals, but also with his ability to create a singular world of horror, one defined by the terrifying rules of his devilishly unbound imagination. Every facet of this masterpiece screams originality, from blood-soaked nightmares and disturbing surrealism to the imagery of the Cenobites and their twisted realm of pleasure and pain. Few have ever crafted a vision as recognizably frightful and unforgettably chilling as Hellraiser.<br /><br />When Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into a house previously occupied by Larry's thrill-seeking brother Frank (and former lover to Julia), they unwittingly resurrect the zombified remains of the treasure hunter long since trapped in the confines of hell. Needing human blood to fully regain his original form, Frank plays upon Julia's feelings for him and manipulates her into bringing unsuspecting victims back to the house. When Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) discovers Frank's sinister plan, all hell is literally unleashed upon them in the form of grisly demons intent on subjecting their summoners to indescribable horrors.<br /><br />Easily the most impressive aspects of the late 80's thriller are its ample gore effects and shocking imagery. Ingenious special effects combined with Bob Keen's skillful makeup work result in several truly unforgettable moments of terror - most notably in Frank's ghastly reincarnation, Kirsty's crimson deathbed nightmare, and the shockingly violent conclusion. In addition to the mesmerizing practical blood and makeup effects, Hellraiser offers us the Cenobites, treacherous demons whose gothic and bondage influenced blend of attire and weaponry showcase Barker's knack for macabre visuals. The now legendary Pinhead is perhaps the most stylistic of them all, standing tall in black leather garb and crowned with a face full of pins. Like Freddy Kreuger and Jason Voorhees before them, the villainous Cenobites have become so popular that they have surpassed their antagonist roots to virtually become the stars, as evidenced in practically all of the sequels. Instead of rooting for the protagonists to defeat the cunning torturers, we anxiously wait to see who they will kill next.<br /><br />A few clich&eacute; lines, some novice acting, and questionable lightning effects really can't detract from one of the most original and terrifying horror films ever created. Many have copied, few have equaled, and as Pinhead would have you believe, no one has ever escaped.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></body></html>

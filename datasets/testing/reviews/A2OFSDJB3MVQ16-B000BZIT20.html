<meta name="summary" content="Scott's first sci-fi thriller is a classic next to "Blade Runner""></head><body><p>After seeing the disappointing "Prometheus", one can appreciate the qualities of this classic which many regard as a retread of an inferior thriller, "It, the Terror from Space", which suffered from sub-par acting, a low budget and a lousy script. Not so with this film which featured Sigourney Weaver in an astounding debut along with a superb cast which included Tom Skerritt, Yaphett Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, and Ian Holm in roles so well defined that one cares what will happen to them which was missing in "Prometheus" with the exception of two characters. Also Scott wisely used a political message like Verhoven did in "RoboCop" about the individual versus the corporation and what happens when we follow rather than lead.  Another thing that Scott was allow us to know each of these character before the terror begins, slowly building suspense until it's unbearable but I don't mean to disparage his latest effort because despite some flaws it's still heads and tails above what Hollywood nowadays is producing since Noomi Rapace (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Michael Fassbinder (Shame, A Dangerous Method) really redemn the film.  Nevertheless if you like Scott and sci-fi films in general, this one's for you.</p></body></html>

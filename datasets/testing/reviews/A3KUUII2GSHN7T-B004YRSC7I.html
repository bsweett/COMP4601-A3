<meta name="summary" content="One of those like it or hate it films."></head><body><p>The most well crafted film in recent memory.  I loved this film but be warned, it may require intense disussion amongst friends at the end of the film.  <p>If you like films like the Usual Suspects and LA Confidential(and who doesn't?), then this film will be right up your alley. It has a plot twist that is second to none. Guy Pearce does an astonishing job in this film and you'd never know he was an Aussie from the vocal job he does in this movie.  WATCH IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!<p>...</p></body></html>

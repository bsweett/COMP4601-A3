<meta name="summary" content="A little pain with your pleasure"></head><body><p>15 years ago extremely gifted horror writer and author Clive Barker made his directorial debut with the original Hellraiser; a film that would re-define the horror genre, spawn many inept sequels that suffered without Barker at the helm, and introduce one of the most frightening, menacing, and unforgettable horror icons in film history: Pinhead.  Based on Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser was one of the few films that delivered loads of graphic violence and gore and could still be scary as hell, something that can very rarely be pulled off in the horror genre, especially today.  I'm not going to go into the storyline, you can read it in the Amazon review or one of many other customer's reviews, but I will say that this new edition DVD which is remastered by Anchor Bay (also responsible for recent remastered DVD's of the Evil Dead Trilogy and Manhunter among others) is great and features some commentary from Barker himself.  All in all, if you've never seen the original Hellraiser, you are sorely lacking.  But be warned: if you consider the recent "teen horror thrillers" to be horror films, then this definitely isn't for you.</p></body></html>

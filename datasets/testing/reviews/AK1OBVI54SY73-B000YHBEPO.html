<meta name="summary" content="A Bit Much"></head><body><p>I have been a fan of Tom Cruise's older films for the longest time, so regardless of his disappointing performance in War of the Worlds, I decided I wasn't going to give up on him yet. And I must say in this film that his acting is indeed less embarrassing but also pretty average. He doesn't impress I mean, I think many actors could have did his role easily and just as well unforunately. The rest of the cast was pretty average too...I don't know they failed to keep the story interesting all of them.<br /><br />That wasn't the only problem either. The biggest to me was the action. I don't know but throughout the entire movie I grew very tired of all the ways the movie was trying to impress me with the very heavy action scenes. I think it all was a bit much after awhile, and unnecessary even in some parts of the film. I think Tom Cruise needs to learn a little does a lot. That's my view on it. Some others may just love all of that but I didn't. Those sort of scenes ended up leaving me very bored and even fast forwarding in some parts.<br /><br />The entire movie lost me quickly. I stayed till the end, but I was glad when the credits finally rolled. Compared to War of the Worlds this movie is a step up for Cruise, but that isn't saying too much honestly.<br /><br />2/5</p></body></html>

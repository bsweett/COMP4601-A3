<meta name="summary" content="Lots to Like with Spike Lee's newest film....."></head><body><p>OK, forgive me here while I stretch my female sense of incredulity. Denzel Washington. And. Clive Owen. In one movie. Give me a portable fan and some smelling salts and let me revel in two of my favorite "guys" on the big screen. ..... All right, I'm calm now. Time to review.<br /><br />Denzel Washington has made all too many movies that start out the same....just another tale, with Denzel being competent and cool, and the film being somewhat provocative, but somewhat forgettable. "Inside Man" starts out like that. It seems predictable, but it rapidly becomes something else.<br /><br />The big attraction here is Spike Lee who has been better lately, as an actor (in the documentary...."Through the Fire"), than as a director in recent years ("She Hate Me" (?) "Sucker Free City" (?); give me strength!). His "25th Hour" was passable; self-indulgent, slow, poorly edited -- and with a cast to die for (Ed Norton, P.Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Anna Pacquin, Rosario Dawson, New York City!), Lee shoulda done better. Shoulda, coulda, did, finally with this film. Lee found his screenwriter (a rookie) and his editor for "Inside Man", and they are both forces to be reckoned with. And what a cast he rounded up!<br /><br />The movie's complex, it flashes, moves, unnerves you with the fact that you can't figure it out. Clive Owen is holding up a bank and seems forced to take hostages. The hostages are clothed the same as Clive's gang. Now, who is hostage and who is robber? Is he really there to rob the bank, or did he have another agenda? Owen is Dalton Russell and he's about to pull a bait and switch on everyone else.<br /><br />Dalton's foil is the hostage negotiator, you guessed it, Washington, as a man with other places he'd rather be. Washington washes with the flow of the film, does a smooth job, works off partner Bill Mitchell (the solid actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, from "Dirty, Pretty Things"). He's daunted by Dalton, but who is the cat, and who is the mouse?<br /><br />Once you add the smarmy Christopher Plummer (just as good as he was in Syriana) who owns the bank and is clearly more worried about some secret that is in danger, and his agent provacateur, Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to the mix, you're swimming in talent, plot and cattiness. Foster provides a lot of barbs, a quick, cutting wit, and the ice that a certain former First Lady is famous for.<br /><br />And, if you're like me, the truth about the robbery will begin to dawn on you just as the film begins to close, and you'll be glad you plunked down your $8 to see a fine, really fine Spike-Denzel-Clive and the gang film. A film that involves you; a film that makes you sit up and take notice. A film that puts Spike Lee back on the map.<br /><br />It's not award-winning, but I've got to give "Inside Man" a 4 star rating, for the sheer enjoyment of it all!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great for Sci-Fi Fans. 68 out of 100"></head><body><p>Pitch Black is a Sci-Fi film sure to please fans of the genre. While the acting wavers at time, the film is held together by a good storyline, and by the film presense of Vin Diesel. I just finished my second viewing of Pitch Black, and enjoyed it once again.<br /><br />The story is as such (without spoilers): A crew of 40+ crashes on a distant planet after their ship is hit by a meteor shower. Few survive, but those that do must deal with a brutal ex-con (Diesel), and an enemy that loves the dark are attacks during a coming eclipse.<br /><br />My rating of this movie is primarily for fans of sci-fi and action movies. Those who could care less about these genres will probably not like Pitch Black, simply because the acting has occasional glimpses of mediocrity. But alas, Vin Diesel holds the movie together. You love and hate him at the same time.<br /><br />The story is quite unique, and in the end I felt entertained and emotionally involved with the characters. A main character dies at the end, and I was saddened. Also, at the end I am left wanting the story to continue. I am grateful that the Chronicles of Riddick do not end here.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 68<br /><br />40 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />4 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />7 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br /><br />5 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br /><br />7 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br /><br />5 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

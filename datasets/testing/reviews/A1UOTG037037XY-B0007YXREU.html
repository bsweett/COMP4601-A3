It even made it into a US Military scandal in Iraq or Afghanistan (I can't tell the difference) when the American soldiers were videotaped "durka durka durka" -ing at a civilian family before they killed the family.  They got into trouble for that.  Check youtube for their home video that was the smoking gun.  I bet Team America's Buck O'Five philosophy influenced numerous young Americans to enlist and carry weapons in some far off dessert inhabited by foreigners.</p></body></html>

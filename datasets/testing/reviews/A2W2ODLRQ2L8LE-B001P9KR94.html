<meta name="summary" content="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in India"></head><body><p>First the Good: Acting and character selection as well as the choice of the music tracks. The three main characters (Jamal, Salim and Latika) are each portrayed by three different actors. The transitions are smooth, and they resemble quite a bit, so it makes it believable.<br />The storyline is made up of a series of back flashes that give you the background story of Jamal. A key element that ties the story together is Jamal's undying love for Latika, who he eventually wins over.<br /><br />The Bad: Latika becomes the servant of a gangster, and when she tries to run away, her face is scarred. Women are undermined in this film and treated more like property to be used and abused at will, rather than equal human beings. (Maybe this has to do with the Indian culture).<br /><br />The Ugly: What I found quite disturbing about this film is the over-emphasis on the cruelty shown to children. Displayed is the deliberate blinding of children so that when they go begging they would get twice as much. Additionally young Jamal is shown jumping into a sewerage pit and is totally covered in filth. In another scene, while Salim is sleeping naked, minced hot peppers are poured unto his private parts.<br />The elements of this film are tightly intertwined, but you may find that some of the images in this film can leave you disturbed.</p></body></html>

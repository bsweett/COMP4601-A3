<meta name="summary" content="Slow Story with Some Smiles"></head><body><p>"Sideways" is a comedy of the unpredictable roads of life.<br /><br />In this journey, two men,  Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), go on a wine-tasting trip and end up finding laughter, women, and fine wine.  Jack is celebrating his final days as a bachelor, and Miles is his tour guide of sorts, a man who knows and enjoys fine wine.  Jack is a handsome risk-taker character actor and Miles is the mild mannered neurotic lonely man.  They are as different as night and day, but they are friends facing the autumn of their lives, wishing they had done more and been more.<br /><br />Soon they become faced with free-spirited women (Viginia Madsen and Sandra Oh), and fabulous fun happens.  Also, a realization that each day opens with opportunity and a chance to start over.  There is also fine wine to enjoy and savor like life itself.  This is a roadtrip examining character and hope as well as the ups and downs of everyman's life.<br /><br />Although slow, overall the film is worth watching for some smiles, and interesting insights.</p></body></html>

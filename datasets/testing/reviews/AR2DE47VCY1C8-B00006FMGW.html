<meta name="summary" content="Good entertainment, but less than factual"></head><body><p>This movie purports to be about an actual person, Frank Abagnale, Jr., who posed more or less successfully as an airline pilot, teacher, physician, lawyer, and Secret Service agent (not in that order) before he turned 21.<p><p>It begins in a television studio, with three people all claiming to be the real Frank Abagnale, leaving the audience to judge who the real one is, but never returns to that sequence, and doesn't finish it.<p><p>I remember seeing just such a TV show years ago, which showed just such an imposter, but whose name I've forgotten.  I remember that he posed as a surgeon in the Canadian Navy, where he actually removed an apprendix successfully, and as a professor at St. Martin's college outside Olympia, Washington.<p><p>I don't remember all of the other details or parts he played, but I suspect that he was the trigger character for this movie.  If so, this was highly fictionalized, although the original story was supposedly written by Abagnale himself (the real con man).<p><p>Steven Spielberg produced and directed Catch Me If You Can, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing a 17-year-old as the lead whose mother and father are splitting up, and eventually divorce.  The mother is cheating on his father, depicted as a romantic loser by Martin Sheen.  The FBI agent that is tailing Abagnale is very well portrayed by Tom Hanks.  DiCaprio, Sheen, and Hanks all turn in good peformances.<p><p>The impostor that I saw on the TV show I later heard dropped out of sight, and apparently went back to his old tricks.  In the movie, Abagnale was sentenced to do 12 years in federal prison for bouncing a couple of million bucks worth of bad checks, but then was hired by the FBI to help them catch other "paper hangers."<p><p>The denouement stated that Abagnale eventually was married, had children, and was living "happily ever after."<p><p>It sounds too much like the character I saw on TV to be coincidental, but that guy was not a 17-year-old. More like in his forties, and not all that good-looking. Maybe Abagnale was a "copy cat." <p> <p>As another reviewer has said, Spielberg does not sufficiently delve into to details of how Abagnale pulled off his impersonations (it all looks far too easy), nor his motivation.<p><p>All in all, it was an entertaining film.<p><p>Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books</p></body></html>

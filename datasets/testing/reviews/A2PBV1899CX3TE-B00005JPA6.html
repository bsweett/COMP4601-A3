<meta name="summary" content="Hi! Are you a fairy?"></head><body><p>Guillermo del Toro is a Mexican director, but El laberinto del fauno is set in fascist dictator Franco's Espana. But for all its fantasy and fairy tale elements, it might just as well be set in Neverland, where all stories begin with "Once upon a time..."<br /><br />&iexcl;Vamanos! Our story begins as 11-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to meet her new husband, El Capit&aacute;n Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). El Capit&aacute;n is stationed in a lonely outpost in the wild country, quelling a rebellion. Carmen is with his child, and is in no condition for such an arduous journey. Nevertheless, he insists that his son should be born where his father is. Ofelia is skeptical of her new step father. Her real father was a tailor.<br /><br />-------------<br />Carmen: The captain has been so good to us... Please, Ofelia, call him father. It's just a word, Ofelia, just a word.<br />========<br /><br />Vidal is a heartless fascist, and Ofelia senses that immediately. She seeks to escape the harsh regime of El Capit&aacute;n through stories and fantasies. The lines of demarcation between what seems real and what seems fantastic start to blur. She discovers an ancient stone labyrinth, and her journey has begun.<br /><br />-------------<br />Ofelia: My name is Ofelia. Who are you?<br />Pan: Me? I've had so many names. Old names that only the wind and the trees can pronounce. I am the mountain, the forest and the earth. I am... I am a faun. Your most humble servant, Your Highness.<br />========<br /><br />There is a tradition in South American Literature known as Magical Realism, or lo real maravilloso. Though the term was first coined by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925, it was Alejo Carpentier who gave the term its current definition. The Venezuelan essayist and fiction writer Arturo Uslar Pietri was also eager to promote this literary mixture as an exceptional feature of Latin American literature. Magic realist authors include Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier, Isabel Allende, and Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. "My most important problem was destroying the lines of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic" said Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez.<br /><br />------------<br />Mercedes: My mother told me to be wary of Fauns.<br />========<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro has written a story that falls within the realm of Magical Realism. On a side note, he quotes S?ren Kierkegaard when explaining the ending, but I can't reveal the quote without spoiling the ending.<br /><br />This story was very close to Guillermo's coraz&oacute;n, and legend has it that he turned down an offer to direct The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to do this film instead. He gave up his entire salary, including back-end points, to see this film realized. He was offered double the budget by Hollywood producers provided the film was made in English, but he turned them all down, unwilling to compromise. He even wrote all the English subtitles himself, to ensure that they were true to his original vision.<br /><br />For years he kept a sketch book where he would draw pictures and scribble notes about his ideas for the film, until one day he left it in a taxi. He was going to give up on the project, but the cab driver, realizing the importance of the notes, tracked him down and returned them. He took this as a sign that he should continue his quixotic quest.<br /><br />--------------<br />Capit&aacute;n Vidal: I choose to be here because I want my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.<br />=========<br /><br />The bottom line is that Guillermo del Toro's film is a masterpiece like Jean Cocteau's La belle et la b?te or Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. It's a film that creates a fable, which is much harder to do than it looks. Guillermo speaks the language not only of films, but also of dreams, of myths, and of fairy tales. His notes and sketches for this film remind me of the recently discovered Red Book by Carl Jung, where Jung also attempted to capture the ephemeral dreams and notions of his subconscious and divine their meaning.<br /><br />--------------<br />Carmen: You're getting older, and you'll see that life isn't like your fairy tales. The world is a cruel place. And you'll learn that, even if it hurts.<br />[throws the mandrake onto the fire]<br />Ofelia: No! No!<br />Carmen: Ofelia! Magic does not exist. Not for you, me or anyone else.<br />=========<br /><br />Though the film does have elements of the fairy tale it is not for young children, because the world's more full of weeping than they can understand. There are some quite disturbing moments of violence that are only too real. One character, the Pale Man, played by Doug Jones (who also portrayed El Fauno), was so unsettling that he even made Stephen King squirm. Del Toro was seated next to King at a screening and he compared seeing the horror king's reaction to winning three Oscars. Besides the three Oscars and three other Oscar nominations, his film also received a 22 minute standing ovation at Cannes.<br /><br />--------<br />Ofelia: Mercedes, do you believe in fairies?<br />Mercedes: No. But when I was a little girl, I did. I believed in a lot of things I don't believe anymore.<br />Ofelia: Last night a fairy visited me.<br />===<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F7MSFM">Hellboy II: The Golden Army (Widescreen)</a> (2008) Doug Jones was Abe Sapien; Directed by Guillermo del Toro<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77LWE">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Remix)</a> (2005) Doug Jones was Cesare<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a> (2004) Doug Jones was Abe Sapien; Directed by Guillermo del Toro<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation (Superbit Collection)</a> (2002) Doug Jones was Augustus Margary<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006I4YZ">Y Tu Mama Tambien (R-rated Edition)</a> (2001) Maribel Verd&uacute; was Luisa Cort&eacute;s<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXJA">The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle</a> (2000) Doug Jones was FBI Agent - Carrot<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O3Z4Z2">Three Kings (Keepcase)</a> (1999) Doug Jones was Dead Iraqi Soldier<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000035Z38">Mystery Men</a> (1999) Doug Jones was Pencilhead<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005J9PB">Tank Girl</a> (1995) Doug Jones was Additional Ripper<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J06U">Batman Returns</a> (1992) Doug Jones was Thin Clown<br /><br />--------------<br />Ofelia: Hi!

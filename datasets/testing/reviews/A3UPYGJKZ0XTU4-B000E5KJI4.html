<meta name="summary" content="Even in Heavily Abridged Form, the Trojan War Entertains."></head><body><p>"Troy" is the latest Hollywood effort to bring the epic tale of the Trojan War, which legend places around 1200 B.C., to the screen. Screenwriter David Benioff claims Homer's "The Iliad" as inspiration, but "Troy" actually incorporates details from several ancient sources, including "The Odyssey" and probably the "Little Iliad" or "Sack of Ilion", both written a little later. "The Iliad" only covers a short period of time in the Trojan War, and begins a decade into the conflict. "Troy" reduces the war to what seems like only a few weeks, keeps most of "The Iliad"'s principle characters, but changes some of their actions and motivations.<br /><br />"Troy" maintains the traditional cause of the Trojan War: While on a diplomatic visit to Sparta, in Greece, young Prince Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) falls in love with King Menalaus' wife, the lovely Helen (Diane Kruger), who incites the wrath of her husband (Brendan Gleeson) by accompanying Paris back to Troy, across the sea. King Menalaus of Sparta implores his brother, King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), an ambitious and ruthless military leader who has managed to force all of the Greek city-states into a loose confederation under his rule, to raise a Greek army to attack Troy. Agamemnon is only too happy to have an excuse to conquer Troy, but needs Greek's greatest warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt) to commit to the war. Achilles hates Agamemnon, but when his friend Odysseus (Sean Bean), the clever King of Ithaca, appeals to his vanity, Achilles cannot refuse the  opportunity for immortality that the great war will bring its heroes. In Troy, King Priam (Peter O'Toole) is confident that his city walls will withstand a Greek attack. His eldest son, the great warrior Hector (Eric Bana) is contemptuous of Paris' reckless action, but committed to his family and country all the same. He prepares the army to fight, but fears the worst.<br /><br />Every writer who has told the story of the Trojan War since ancient times has had to invent rationale to explain why all of the Greek city-states would go to war for one cuckolded king, why the Trojans don't just send Helen back to Greece, and why the great warrior Achilles withdraws from the conflict and then changes his mind. "Troy" changes some of the interactions between the characters and creates its own line of reasoning that makes sense -or as much sense as is necessary- within its own narrative. The character of Briseis (Rose Byrne), a Trojan priestess of the Temple of Apollo who is abducted by the Greeks, is a composite of "The Iliad"'s Briseis and Chryseis, Achilles' mistress and Agamemnon's captive, respectively. Combining the two women turns out to be a good idea, as she can exacerbate the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon, provide both men with opportunity to demonstrate their character, and make mercenary, vain Achilles sympathetic. Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) is another altered character. Traditionally Achilles' close companion, in "Troy" Patroclus is his young cousin whose eagerness proves fateful.<br /><br />Some viewers will be appalled to see an epic poem turned into epic fluff. "Troy" is 2 1/2 hours of epic fluff, occasionally bordering on cheese. Its shortcoming isn't its departure from "The Iliad" or any other source of the ancient legend. The Trojan War is legend, not a true story or even a novel to which one is expected to be faithful. The story of Troy has changed to suit its audience with every retelling for thousands of years. "Troy" carries on that tradition. The trouble is that, in condensing thousands of written pages into pivotal events and characters only, much of the substance is lost. But "Troy" does still manage to be a tragedy, as Homer intended. And it is entertaining, as I'm sure all ancient poets and oral storytellers hoped. It's just not eloquent or sophisticated. "Troy" is an abridged story, but basically an entertaining one.</p></body></html>

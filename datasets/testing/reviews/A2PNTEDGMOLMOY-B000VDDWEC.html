While "Dawn" opened with a magnificent sequence showing the carnage -- both intimate and grand in scale -- of a zombie infestation, "28 Days Later" opens with pure dislocation.<br /><br />Following an opening scene where environmental activists unwittingly let loose the "rage virus" by freeing infected chimps (including a nice reference to "A Clockwork Orange"), the movie really sets its tone with some of the most amazing shots of London ever.  Bike messenger Jim -- injured by a car -- awakens in a hospital 28 days after the virus was unleashed.  He is completely alone.  And I mean *alone*!  Wandering first through the hospital and then through the streets of London, Jim does not see a soul . . . and the mind reels as the stark reality of an empty city hits home.  In several shots with no action whatsoever, the film establishes its tone of ominous foreboding - high marks!<br /><br />Eventually, of course, Jim encounters some zombies.  The "rage virus" is lethal, and if the virus gets into your bloodstream -- whether from a scratch, a bite, or, most creepily, if it makes contact with your eyeballs, you have about 20 seconds before you become a zombie.  Jim is saved by two survivors, and demands to know what is going on.  This leads to the typically British understatement, "Jim, I've got some bad news."<br /><br />"28 Days Later" stays on a five-star path through the first half as a handful of survivors (including personal favorite Brendan Gleeson as a doting father) unite, fight some zombies, and strive to find some answers.  The ensemble tries to put a brave face on their situation, but there's a melancholy behind their forced humor that is very realistic.<br /><br />The movie then goes to a strange place.  Our little band runs into a surviving group of soldiers, bunkering in a huge manor behind barbed wire and land mines.  This is a typical "out of the frying pan and into the fire" situation, which is foretold by the general creepiness of the commanding officer, played by Christopher Eccleston ("Elizabeth," "Shallow Grave"), who is rapidly developing a body of work as one of the movies' most reliable villains.<br /><br />The action devolves into a human-against-human-against-zombie climax which is a bit over-reliant on coincidence -- at one point, a character purposefully smashes a car into a building just in time for a zombie to rip the passenger out of the back seat, even though she should have had no idea that the zombie was there.  Whatever.  One does not go to zombie flicks for logic -- but still, the scenes with the soldiers don't feel quite in line with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />That is a mere quibble, perhaps keeping this movie in the four-star range rather than the five-star effort it was shaping up to be.  This movie is scary, scary, scary, and has enough meat on its bones to stay with you after the lights go up.<br /><br />The DVD's extras are good, too, including three alternate endings (one is good, one is okay, and the radical ending is very thought-provoking), making-of features, and director's commentary.  An excellent DVD for a very good movie!</p></body></html>

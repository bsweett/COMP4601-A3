This isn't to say that the film is implausible; truth be told, I don't think there's any way of knowing how realistic such situations are. But considering the disturbing intensity of the story and the strong dynamic between actors Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon, it's difficult to embrace these technicalities. This is easily one of the most unsettling films in recent memory, forcing the audience down an unpleasant path of paranoia that spirals out of control in a relatively short period of time. The film refuses to be a clear-cut study of insanity; there's a subtle brilliance to the way Friedkin explores uncertainty and panic, as if to say that we're not meant to have all the answers.<br /><br />Nor should we. What is obvious is that, from the average person's point of view, every behavior in this film is overwhelmingly irrational. We get a small taste of this with the introduction of Agnes White (Judd), a divorcee living in a motel somewhere in the middle of Oklahoma. The first scene is of her receiving mysterious phone calls, in which the person at the other end says absolutely nothing. Already, she assumes that it's her violent, controlling ex-husband, Jerry Goss (Harry Connick, Jr.), recently released from prison on parole. Indeed, it does seem likely that he's making the calls. But does she know for sure? How can she know? How can the audience know? Even when he reenters her life later on in the film, it's impossible to come to any conclusions. It could be that Agnes is allowing her fear to take hold. The fact that she's incredibly lonely only adds to her erratic emotional state.<br /><br />Then along comes Peter Evans (Shannon), an initially soft-spoken man with an underlying uneasiness that effectively makes us uncomfortable. He's a drifter with a hidden past who occasionally lets loose his expanded vocabulary (Agnes is initially confused by the word "matriarchal"). He makes it clear that he's not really interested in a sexual relationship (not at first, anyway); he merely wants to be friends. From the audience's perspective, everything about this situation is off; here are two fragile individuals looking for companionship under less than ideal circumstances. Is it any wonder that Agnes' willingness to take him in is unnerving? It doesn't help that she listens to him carefully, even when he begins spewing information about tiny bugs he thinks are infesting his bloodstream. In some sick way, it's as if he's telling her what she wants to hear.<br /><br />The rest of the film veers into territory ruled purely by paranoia, the tension building itself until it becomes unbearably thick. Peter eventually reveals that he's an AWOL military officer; he believes that a faction of the government has injected him with thousands of microscopic aphids that have the ability to transmit information. He's now on the run from Dr. Sweet (Brian F. O'Byrne), the man responsible for conducting the experiments. Not only is he able to convince Agnes of this, he also makes her believe that she has now become infested. While we don't see any bugs, they believe that they're seeing them everywhere, especially on their skin. Supposedly, they can burrow through the skin back into the bloodstream; this forces Peter and Agnes to incessantly swat, scratch, and pick at themselves. Eventually, their bodies are covered with open sores.<br /><br />As the film progresses, Agnes' room transforms into a bizarre kind of shelter; bug zappers and flypaper hang from the ceiling, while every other surface is coated in aluminum foil (it helps to block the bugs' transmissions). How they went about this doesn't matter. The plot was never interested in focusing on logistics, and rightfully so. We're now fully immersed in the delusional world of two people who were made for each other, a world in which nonsensical ramblings make perfect sense. The last ten minutes of the film have both Judd and Shannon delivering high-intensity speeches that almost come off as poetic in a twisted sort of way; their words point to an explanation only they can understand, and in turn offer a solution that only they see as appropriate. How the audience feels is of no concern, and that's exactly the way it should be. When both Peter and Agnes look into a microscope holding a drop of Peter's blood, the sense that they're seeing what they want to see allows us to emotionally detach from the characters and let them continue to unravel.<br /><br />During the end credits, I learned that "Bug" originated as a play written by Tracy Letts (who also penned the screenplay). I then left the theater wondering how this ever could have been performed on a stage, not because of the sets or the story, but because of the sheer intensity; it's difficult to imagine a live audience sitting through something so disturbing. However, if this film adaptation is any indication, then the play must have something truly unique, a fascinating work that delves into insanity with amazing precision and style. But until I actually see it, then my praise can apply only to the film. But what a film it is.</p></body></html>

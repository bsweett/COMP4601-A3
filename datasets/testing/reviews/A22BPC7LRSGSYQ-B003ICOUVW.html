The movie's plot was changed considerably, though it does retain a lot of the original plot.  One huge change is that the movie now takes place in 1891.  This movie stars Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Geraldine Chapman, Art Malik, and Hugo Weaving.  The musical score by Danny Elfman is pretty good.<br /><br />This movie is definitely darker and scarier than the original.  This movie has a lot of CGI, but it's done well.  The movie looks great - dark and creepy woods, fog, mist, a full moon, creepy interior sets, etc.  Some critics say that this movie lacks suspense and scariness.  I disagree.  I think it has plenty of suspense and scares, considering it's a werewolf movie.  What do you really expect in a werewolf movie?  I think it would be unrealistic to expect a werewolf to tiptoe around his unsuspecting victims.  A werewolf is part wolf (a wild animal) and part man.  What do wild animals do?  Wild animals just attack full throttle - that's it.  That's the style of the werewolf creature and werewolf movies in general.  Maybe that's where the so-called lack of suspense comes in.  The werewolves just suddenly attack, in other words, jump-out-of-your-seat moments instead of creeping around.  Look at what happens when a man transforms into a werewolf - once the transformation is over, the werewolf goes on the attack and goes berzerk.  However, there IS some suspense leading up to some of the werewolf attacks out in the woods, in my opinion.  Some people might not like how the werewolf runs on four legs, but stands on two legs.  I think the four-legged running is cool.  The werewolves look terrifying.<br /><br />This DVD has the unrated director's cut, which is 1 hour, 59 minutes.  Also included is the theatrical cut, which is 1 hour, 43 minutes.  I like the director's cut a lot better than the theatrical version.  The extra 16 minutes contain a lot of good stuff.<br /><br />If you want to see a good werewolf movie, then I recommend this one.</p></body></html>

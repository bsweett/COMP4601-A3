<meta name="summary" content="Michael Mann's mean streets..."></head><body><p>After the commercial failure and mixed critical reaction to the vastly underrated Ali, Michael Mann returns to familiar territory-the urban crime thriller-with Collateral. Coming off three grandiose epics in a row, the veteran filmmaker shifts gears with this lean, no-nonsense movie that harkens back to early films in his career like, Thief. Like the late Stanley Kubrick (of whom Mann is sometimes compared to), Mann has tried repeatedly to breakthrough to a mainstream audience. It would make sense then that he would cast Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise as one of the main protagonists. If there were any actor on the planet that could guarantee a sure-fire hit at the box office it would be Cruise. However, Mann throws a potential spanner in the works by casting the actor as an amoral hit man. Would this scare off a mainstream audience?<br /><br />The first disc features an informative audio commentary track by director Michael Mann. The veteran filmmaker really did his homework as he talks about the realistic details used in the background of scenes and with various characters. He also talks at length about the characters' backstories and motivations.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "City of Night: The Making of Collateral," a 41-minute look at how this film came together and was made. There is also footage of Tom Cruise training with a weapons expert so that he could credibly portray a professional assassin on screen. This is a step up above the usual electronic press kit material.<br /><br />"Special Delivery" takes a look at some of the research Cruise did for this role. In order to get into character, Mann disguised the actor as FedEx delivery man and had him deliver a package to a business in a crowded place and not get recognized. Included is actual footage of Cruise in action.<br /><br />There is one deleted scene with commentary by Mann. It shows Vincent and Max going into LAX to lose the police and federal surveillance that is tracking them.<br /><br />"Shooting on Location: Annie's Office" examines the use of high-definition digital video used to capture Vincent stalking Annie in her darkened office at night. It is a scene that would have been impossible to render on traditional film.<br /><br />"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse" gives a glimpse into the creative process as we see footage of the two actors reading through a scene in Mann's office, juxtaposed with the final scene in the movie.<br /><br />"Visual FX: MTA Train" shows how Mann used a green screen effect on the climatic sequence on the train so that he could customize the backgrounds to suit his vision.<br /><br />Finally, there are cast and crew biographies and extensive production notes.<br /><br />Collateral is a fitting addition to Michael Mann's distinctive filmography. It continues his thematic pre-occupations of isolated protagonists who have little time for personal relationships. It is also deals with another Mann obsession: transformation. In order to have any chance of surviving the night with Vincent, Max must change from being a passive character to one that takes an active role in determining his own fate. It is the exploration of such weighty themes, coupled with Mann's distinctive style that elevates Collateral from its generic conventions.</p></body></html>

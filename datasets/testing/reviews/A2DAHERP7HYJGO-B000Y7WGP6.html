But until now, few movies have been made focusing on attacks abroad. All that changes with THE KINGDOM.<br /><br />At a U.S. base in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a terrorist attack leaves many involved at a weekend softball game/cookout dead or wounded. To add insult to injury, as the investigative team on site tries to put together what happened, a second bomb explodes leaving more devastation and the team dead.<br />In Washington, D.C., word returns to the main offices of the FBI. Close friend to one of the victims who was asked moments before the attack to come help, Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx). Fleury breaks the news to fellow terrorists' agents and then request to take a team in to look for clues. Denied due to bureaucratic maneuverings, Fleury goes beyond normal channels to influence both the U.S. government and the Saudi government to allow his team in. Granted 5 days, they set out for Riyadh.<br />Assigned to work with the team, or rather to watch over them, Col. Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom) is as interested in catching those responsible as Fleury. It was in the guise of his soldiers that the terrorists began the attack.  More red tape prevents Fleury and his team from doing what they want, but eventually they have the chance and when they do, the pieces of the puzzle begin to come together.<br />As the team tries to find the solution to the explosion, the same terrorists look at their arrival as another chance to strike a blow at the U.S. and the House of Saud. Preparations begin to launch a second attack via bomb at the team before they can leave. Which team will find the other first and accomplish their goal is what makes this movie a taut thriller that has you in its grip from beginning to end.<br />Foxx shows that he is a commanding force to be reckoned with on screen. He has substantial support in the actors that make up Fleury's team (Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). And Barhom does an excellent job as the man in the middle, trying to remain loyal to his country and help his new friends at the same time.<br />With the Middle East the powder keg that it is, this movie is both controversial and perfectly timed for release. And best of all it doesn't take a political stance at all but focuses on the facts and the story of a law enforcement team trying to do what it does best. Offering entertainment, enlightenment, information and white knuckled action make this movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

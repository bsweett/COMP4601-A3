<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece"></head><body><p>This movie is perfect. What can I say? Rarely does a movie based on a comic book get it right on the level that this film does. Usually with movies like X-Men or Fantastic Four, there are so many characters and storylines that certain elements get lost or becoming confusing. That problem doesn't exist in this film. The storyline is just brilliant. It really makes you think about politics and the government that exist in the real world as well as the media. And it makes you question whether or not terrorism can ever be justified.</p></body></html>

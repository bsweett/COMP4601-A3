<meta name="summary" content="Finally a Social Conscience Film with Energy and Entertainment Value."></head><body><p>Hollywood's attempts at social conscience films in the past several years have been self-indulgent, fractured narratives tailored for self-congratulatory Academy Awards shows. They're barely watchable, much less entertaining. "Blood Diamond" is a welcome exception. An action film with attractive, involving characters and memorable -though unoriginal- dialogue, "Blood Diamond" is set in Sierra Leone in 1999, during the country's bloody civil war in which the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) murdered, maimed, and displaced millions in its attempt to control and profit from the nation's diamond fields.<br /><br />Mercenary soldier Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) smuggles diamonds from Sierra Leone into Liberia, where they eventually make their way into the vaults of the world's largest diamond conglomerate Van de Kaap. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman forced to work in the diamond fields when his village was ravaged by the RUF. When both men are briefly held in the same jail in Freetown, Danny learns that Solomon has hidden a large pink diamond. Danny needs to reimburse his commander for a lost shipment, so he promises Solomon help in finding his family in exchange for the location of the stone. At the same time, he implores American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) for assistance in exchange for damning information on the diamond trade.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou is a powerful, empathetic presence throughout "Blood Diamond", and Jennifer Connelly makes Maddy's sense of adventure, bravery, and commitment to her beliefs infectious. But it is Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of sharp, wounded, resourceful Danny Archer that pulls the audience into this film. Danny's unyielding determination to survive, his relentless motion in the direction of necessity is "Blood Diamond"'s driving force. DiCaprio deserved the praise he received for this performance. The extended sequence of the RUF's assault on Freetown is one of the most memorable depictions of war that I've seen on film. My hat is off to director Edward Zwick, cinematographer Eduardo Serra, and production designer Dan Weil for this surreal spectacle.<br /><br />The civil war in Sierra Leone ended in 2002, and there are now considerably fewer conflict diamonds than in the 1990s. So in some ways this film is old news. But conflict diamonds, which are used to finance violent revolutionary movements and general mayhem, are still very much an issue among human rights activists and critics of the diamond industry. It may be inevitable that the politics of "Blood Diamond" are murky, since the events it depicts are impenetrable. The filmmakers are obviously trying to raise awareness about what one may be subsidizing in purchasing diamonds. But Van de Kaap is an unveiled stand-in for De Beers, and it isn't clear to me what the film wants to say about them. Van de Kaap buys conflict diamonds in order to control the price of diamonds on the world market. But Van de Kaap also supports the mercenary army hired to rout out the RUF. In spite of their representative being a rich, smarmy white man, I'm not sure that this makes Van de Kaap a villain. But then De Beers' relationship to conflict diamonds has never been clear.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Bros. 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc edition of the DVD are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by director Edward Zwick. Zwick discusses Sierra Leone's history and politics, but not as much as I would have liked and not enough to clear up the nebulous points in the plot. He does talk about the cultural connections between Sierra Leone and the Western world, the plight of the child soldiers, and how he approached depicting real events. Zwick also addresses the challenges of filming, cinematography, how he got the necessary exposition into the film, and filming on location in Mozambique and South Africa. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arnold takes it up a notch"></head><body><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger kept taking on one challenger after another as the 80s progressed, needing to pick an even more difficult foe each time.  In &quot;Predator&quot; Arnie found one of his most difficult foes ever, perhaps his single most difficult until facing Satan in &quot;End of Days,&quot; but that is another story altogether.<p>Arnold is leading an elite group of commandos through a South American jungle in a search for kidnapped officials.  It turns out that finding the terrorists that supposedly kidnapped the officials was the easy part.  Getting back out of the jungle turns out to be a nightmare.  The commandos soon discover that the jungle covers a hunter with nearly supernatural abilities, courtesy of a cool high tech suit that renders the hunter nearly invisible.  This very same hunter has agility and strength that even Arnold would envy, and who is physically more than a match for Arnold.  But this movie is not just about Arnold's strength; this time Arnold shows that he is an intelligent hunter, and uses the alien's few weaknesses against him to ultimately get the best of him.<p>This movie does have a few plausibility weaknesses, but you are so busy with the nearly non-stop action and the coolest alien since &quot;Alien&quot; that you have little time to consider the implausibilities until after the movie is over, and by then who cares?  While this movie may not be one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies, it still plays well as an action movie, and provides Arnold with one of his most challenging foes ever.</p></body></html>

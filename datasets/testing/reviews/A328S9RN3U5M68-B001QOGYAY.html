<meta name="summary" content="Taken as Movie, NOT as Screenplay from Sebold's Book, It is Entertaining"></head><body><p>THE LOVELY BONES is a quiet novel about horrendous events described eloquently and with spiritual insights by author Alice Sebold.  While the book, being a rather introspective version of the murder of a young lass, would be difficult to translate to film, Peter Jackson (with a screenplay adaptation by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Jackson himself) should call this version an idea inspired by Sebold's book.  If desiring a reenactment of the novel is the viewer's desire, skip this film, but if simply watching a 'different' Peter Jackson epic is your cup of tea, this film will romance you.<br /><br />The young girl Susie is well played by Saoirse Ronan, and her parents are rather one dimensionally brought to celluloid by Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, with a lot of help from the over-the-top portrayal of Susie's meddling kookie grandmother as molded by Susan Sarandon.  Susie's sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) gets to experience all the things the deceased Susie wanted to experience, Ray Singh gives an interesting bit of strange aura as Ray the one Susie would have loved had she lived, and Michael Imperioli serves well a the policeman who continues to endlessly track the murder.  But the film holds together because of the smarmy  serial killer George Harvey, yet another stellar performance by Stanley Tucci.  He is terrifyingly believable and should scare everyone who watches is sick mind work.<br /><br />The special effects are 'pretty' in a sort of Hallmark cards way and Jackson tries his best to make us follow this maladaptive transformation of Sebold's novel.  But given all the negatives THE LOVELY BONES  is still worth watching, if only as a momentary diversion.  And it would be a shame not to see this performance by Stanley Tucci!

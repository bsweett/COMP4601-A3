<meta name="summary" content="THE GRANDPA OF COMIC-BASED MOVIES."></head><body><p>The historical importance of "Superman: The Movie" is indisputable, as a matter of fact, the importance of the character is indisputable. In the 1930s Superman was one of the earliest superheroes that came to life. In the late 1970s "Superman: The Movie" was the first comic-based movie, and ever since those historical landmarks, thousands of superheroes have come to life in the comics, and dozens of comic-based movies have hit the screen.<br /><br /> Well, many years later, Superman (the comic) has lost a lot of its appeal with younger generations, and Superman (the movie) has dated in many areas. The performances are very solid, to be honest, only "Batman (1989)" can compete with "Superman: The Movie" in that area. But the visual effects every year look more and more dated. Obviously, a movie is much more than special effects, the most important thing in a movie is the story.<br /><br /> Well, this movie tells the story of a superhero who can keep secret his identity with thick eyeglasses and changing his hairstyle, of a flying Alien that can reverse the time and events in the Earth by changing the rotation of the Planet. As you can see, the plot is very na?ve, but it's also very entertaining.<br /><br /> The romantic idea of an almost invincible superhero might not be appealing for today's kids, because today's movies present more complex characters, like the X-Men, Batman or Spider-Man, characters that have a dark side (Batman) or represent issues like the social segregation (X-Men), or have an inner struggle between having a normal life or save people that are not thankful (Spider-Man). But to people who are 30+ years old "Superman: The Movie" is pure fun. By The way, "Superman II" is better than this movie because it actually present a vulnerable hero, he is a more complex character in the second movie, his relationship with Lois is deeper, and he faces real danger.</p></body></html>

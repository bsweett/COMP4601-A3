<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp, Tim Burton - A Strange Combo"></head><body><p>"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (2005) is a fantasy world created by director Tim Burton who has done some off-the-wall movie work. It stars Johnny Depp, lipstick and all, as an androgynous Michael Jackson lookalike. He's playing Willie Wonka, the owner of a candy factory that no longer employs any local people.<br /> Charlie, the title character, has a grandfather who formerly worked in the plant. Willie offers five prize certificates in his candy bars. That way he sells a lot of candy. The lucky five finders of the coupon will receive a tour of the factory accompanied by one companion, and one of the five will get a special gift.<br />Five kids find the prizes, nice kid Charlie and four awful, nasty, despicable brats, rotten little twirps who each gets his or her comeuppance while touring the factory.<br />The wild colors in the factory with its rivers and waterfalls of chocolate are more vivid and startling when seen on in a high definition television screen with a Blu-Ray machine.<br />Are we in a candy factory or a nut house? One actor, Deep Roy, plays all of the hundreds of the Oompa-Loompa tribe that works in the factory. The Oompa-Loompas perform musical numbers, which are like Busby Berkley gone to cuckooland.<br />At times it's a sweet story of a sweets factory, at times is cloyingly sweet, and at other times Johnny Depp plays a cruelly misanthropic and nasty person. He doesn't like kids. He plays a real weirdo.<br />There are some Dickensian touches: Charlie's four pleasant, kindly grandparents spend their time lying in interlocking beds facing each other in front of the fireplace. Charlie and his wonderful loving family live in their ramshackled tipsy house with holes in the roof. It's based upon a famous Roald Dahl children's story and was a movie previously with Gene Wilder.</p></body></html>

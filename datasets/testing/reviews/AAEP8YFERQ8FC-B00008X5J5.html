<meta name="summary" content="Sleeping Beauty"></head><body><p>"Sleeping Beauty" was one of my favorite Disney animations when I was little, along with "Alice in Wonderland". Watched it quite a few times, and know all the words to all the songs, and pretty much all the dialogue, both of which are pretty good.<br /><br />A princess, Aurora, is born, and three fairies come with gifts to give. Only two, beauty and song, are given. The sorceress Malificent interrupts the ceremony, and gives a gift of her own, a promise that when Aurora touches the spindle of a spinning wheel on her sixteenth birthday, she will die. Luckily, the third of the fairies, Merryweather, has her gift to give, and she counters the spell. If the princess does prick her finger, she will fall into sleep rather than death, and can be awoken with true love's first kiss. Still, the King is not convinced, and has every spinning wheel burnt, and the fairies take the child into the forest, to be raised as a peasant under the name of Rose. Will this be enough, or will Malificent get her way?<br /><br />The animation and scenery has a medieval flavor, while the augmented Tchaikovsky score and additional songs really add to the atmosphere. The sorceress Malificent is probably my favorite Disney villain, she's a very carefully crafted character, from the crack of her staff, to her flowing robes to her soft voice. The chatter and squabbles between the good fairies is pretty interesting too, as is the discussions between the two kings. Fine characters all round, though I do feel a bit bad calling Malificent "fine"...<br /><br />Worth a look for fans of fantasy and lovers of animation.</p></body></html>

Just Get Smart & Get It!"></head><body><p>Being a fan of the series since I was a kid, Get Smart the movie was a must-see for my summer movie list, but surely it couldn't be that good, right? Wrong, the movie works in almost every aspect, from the pitch-perfect casting, great characterization, and even the interesting story. Add in comedy that kept me laughing from start to finish, and I left the theater quite pleased.<br /><br />Since then, I've seen this film about 3 or 4 more times, and each time is as good, if not better than the first. An entertaining movie in the truest sense of the word, and it's comic action at its best. Get Smart doesn't miss it by that much, but would you believe it hits it right on the head? Believe it... Now when's that sequel coming out?</p></body></html>

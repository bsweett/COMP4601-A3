<meta name="summary" content="The Last Samurai- An Entertaining Epic"></head><body><p>The Last Samurai, the new Tom Cruise action epic features nice perfomances and great battle sequences.  Director Edward Zwick who made the astounding "Glory" along with the fine film<br /><br />"Legends of Fall," makes another epic with powerful direction.<br />  Tom Cruise delivers a powerful performance as<br />captain nNathan Algren.  He was a hero during the Civil War, but he feels much shame for a horrible atrocity which he participated in which was a slaughter of Indian women and children.  He feels remorse for the Indians and much contempt in the general who he helped commit the act.  So he flees to Japan to train the Japanese army for 500 dollars a month.  During a beginning battle he is captured by a group of Samurai warriors.  Ken Watanabe is so compelling as the Samurai leader he nearly humiliates Cruise.  Cruise is so amazed by the teachings and beliefs of the Samurai he stays with them and fights for their cause.<br />  Being a $140 million epic, The Last Samurai truly does deliver.  The battle sequences are spectacular, some of the best since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  The Last Samurai is rated R for Strong Violence and Battle Sequences.  The battles are not exceptionally bloody but include guns, bayonets, swords, arrows, spears and cannonfire.  They are made to be more intense than actually gory.<br />  The film has been nominated for 3 Golden Globes. Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Origianl Score are the nominees. It will probably receive a substantial amount of Academy Award nominations, we'll just have to wait and see.  All in all a fine film worth viewing in theatres and owning on Video or DVD.  For the Best Actor award, it will definetly be between Tom Cruise and Jude Law, in my opinion.</p></body></html>

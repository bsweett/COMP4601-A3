One of the better black comedies with brutal horrific elements, American Psycho should strike a chord in many.<br /><br />Though it pokes fun at the 2nd greatest US president (Reagan), I couldn't help but nod my head in approval as the director brilliantly expressed her erroneuous views through this artful unfolding of a plastic man.<br /><br />Haven't read the book, but will certainly pick it up sometime soon as this film which should appeal to horror fans as well as indy film lovers and anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, is a memorable one for sure.</p></body></html>

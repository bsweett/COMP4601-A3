Transferred to a rural town, Nicholas begins to clean up the streets with amusing results.<br /><br />I found the character of Nick Angel to be exceptionally funny and likeable. Partnered with the police chief's son, they make an excellent team. I found the ending to be particularly amusing. If you Like Shaun of the Dead, then you'll like this film. This was a well-made film sure to delight fans of buddy cop drama and humorous police shows. 5 stars.</p></body></html>

I actually enjoyed this film, but then I came into it with a predisposition to liking films of this genre.  Films like Spartacus, Ben-Hur, and Gladiator are among my favorites.  That doesn't mean this film lacks problems.  Some of the plotting was a bit long and boring and the acting was not always up to par; however, Colin Farrell was very good in the role of Alexander the Great and Angelina Jolie took mother-behind-the-scenes to new heights.  From an F/X standpoint, the battles were big and exciting, if a bit on the bloody side.  Anyone who enjoys over-the-top historical films full of battles and sex and exotic locales should enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

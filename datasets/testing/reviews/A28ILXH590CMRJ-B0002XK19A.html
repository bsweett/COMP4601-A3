<meta name="summary" content="SPIDER-MAN 2 is a soaring top-notch film"></head><body><p>After the blockbusting success of SPIDER-MAN 2, it was pretty obvious that director Sam Raimi and company would eventually revisit the world of the nerdy photographer Peter Parker and his arachnid alter-ego. The resulting film is not only spectacular, but tops the original in almost every way.  Picking up two years from the events of the original film, Parker finds himself struggling to balance both his personal and super-hero lives without much success.  He loses his pizza delivery job despite using his web-swinging powers for some super fast transit.  He?s unable to prevent his beloved Aunt May from losing the family home.  And perhaps most heart-breaking of all, he alienates himself from everyone, especially the girl he loves, by seemingly never being anywhere on time.  (The fact that he?s late due to the need for his super heroic services doesn?t help matters.)  When his powers start to fade on him, our hero makes the decision to give up being Spider-Man.  Unfortunately, the best laid plans of man and spider go awry as a new super-villain named Doc Ock threatens New York with possible nuclear destruction.<br /><br />Just as before, Sam Raimi directs the whole thing with a keen and sure hand.  In fact, he seems to display more confidence as he effortlessly blends the film?s small and personable moments with the top notch CGI action scenes. Indeed, the entire cast seems more assured.  Tobey Maguire again proves that he was born to play the title role with his doe-eyed Peter Parker tugging at our heartstrings, even as we cheer his super heroics.  Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane, the girl he secretly loves.  J.K. Simmons again hams it up delightfully as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter?s bombastic newspaper boss.  Rosemary Harris gets a bit more to do as the always caring Aunt May.  However, it is the villainy of Alfred Molina?s Doc Ock that pushes this film up a notch.  Portrayed as a basically decent, if somewhat egotistical, scientist, Molina engages both our sympathies and our fears as his character is taken over by the mechanical tentacles that he wears.  It definitely is an improvement on the bombastic Green Goblin of the first film.  (In all fairness, Willem Dafoe, who reprises the role in a cameo, was handicapped by a costume that seemed to belong on a Power Rangers episode.)<br /><br />All in all, SPIDER-MAN 2 grabs your attention from the very first frame to the last.  It?s character and heart matches the large scale action to make a superhero film that is rarely seen these days.  It?s a perfect follow-up to the first film and a movie that gets one of my highest recommendations.</p></body></html>

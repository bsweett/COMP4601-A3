I noticed some differences, especially in the final scenes. Aside from the CGI effects, which were fine, director Matt Reeves seemed to find two ace young actors that had a chemistry that was unsettling. Pre-pubescent love? Kodi-Smit McPhee is a fine young actor, with insight and passion for his character, delivering a most natural angst and desire for a friend. He is bullied, mercilessly, as many are, at school. His family has fallen apart, and you never see his father or his mother's face. He is isolated. In comes Abby, played by the very brilliant Chlo&eacute; Grace Moretz. Suspicion ensues, trust sorta happens, and they end up friends. There's a lot more than that, but I can't blab too much. You may already know this, but it's well put together by Mr. Reeves, and I admire this re-imagining of a fine film. McPhee and Moretz are magic together. The original Swedish "Dragon Tattoo"  films were fine. And I plan to see Fincher's re-imagining of those, too.</p></body></html>

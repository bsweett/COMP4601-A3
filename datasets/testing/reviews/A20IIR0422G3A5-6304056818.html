<meta name="summary" content="Greatest Hard Sci Fi Movie of them All, even with blemishes"></head><body><p>I first saw `Forbidden Planet' when it was originally released in theaters in the late 1950's and at the time, it simply blew me away, and it was my hands down favorite hard core Science Fiction movie up to the release of `2001 A Space Odyssey'. And, even then, I begrudgingly pidgeonholed `2001' into its own special category to preserve the preeminant place of my beloved `Forbidden Planet'.<br /><br />The very first thing which sets `Forbidden Planet' off from so many other 1950's sci-fi movies is that it is clearly not simply a monster movie. Not that there are no good monster movies. Whitness `The Thing' and, of course, `King Kong', but `Forbidden Planet' was pure sci-fi, the kind which is driven by the defining characteristic of the genre. That is the proposition `What if this particular thing were true? What would follow from this (and be turned into the basis of the story)'. The fact that the story was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's `The Tempest' made absolutely no impression on me, as I didn't even realize this until long after the movie had passed into cult heaven. It was much  more impressive to me to realize that the whole idea of `Star Trek' was based on some of the `Forbidden Planet' premises.<br /><br />Watching this movie after almost 50 years of revering it's memory does a lot to enable a more balanced evaluation of the movie. The first thing is that while it remains one of the very best of its period and genre, it is not necessarily head and shoulders over other sci-fi movies of the same period. `The Day the Earth Stood Still' comes to mind as a critically successful movie of the time. But, aside from it's being in color, some differences between `Forbidden Planet' and `The Day...' stand out. The first is the quality of the special effects, done for M-G-M by a team from the Walt Disney studio. In the world of pre `2001' effects, `Forbidden Planet' probably outdid every other movie in special effects quality. They look ordinary by today's standards, but they were most definitely not as hokey as the run of the mill stuff in 1955. The flagship effect, of course, is Robbie the Robot who, to this day, I sneakily believe was a real machine and not a tin suit with someone inside. Even if Robbie was controlled by a human at a console at the end of a long cable, I was still impressed. Robbie set the standard for artificial intelligence on film until the Hal 9000 arrived on the scene. Another aspect of the movie which clearly set it apart from the rest of the pack is the distinctive nature of the sound track music. The credits clearly indicate that the music is synthesized and not performed on traditional string, wind, or percussion instruments. Like so many other things, this music defined sci-fi music for an entire generation.<br /><br />The very best thing about the movie was the sophistication of the `what if' premise. The story is that a scientific team of 20 people lands on the planet Altair 4 and 18 of the 20 are killed by a monstrous entity of pure energy created from the `id' of the team's philologist, Dr. Morbius, enhanced by the technology of the long dead natives of the planet, the Krell, who were killed by their unleashing these `monsters from the id' in their quest to attain a life of pure energy, separated from the body. Even the names `Morbius' and `Krell' have an enchantment about them which rings something in the soul of a teenager of the time.<br /><br />My memory of the plot of `The Tempest' is a bit rusty, but I can see the similarity in a nobleman, `Prospero' being stranded on a remote island with daughter, Miranda and their being found by a party in a passing ship. I also recall the character of Caliban, a `savage and deformed slave' according to my complete Shakespeare. The part of Caliban is played, with a major overhaul, by Robbie, of course. I can see no analogue to the facinating character of Ariel, `an airy spirit'. The adaptors of Will Shakespeare's idea should have made an effort to learn some dialogue from the bard as well as his story line.<br /><br />The most glaring blemish in the movie is some of the really dreadful use of words of which I am sure the script writers were proud as being examples of supplying new words for concepts of the future. Unfortunately, this dialogue grates rather than impresses. The other surface blemish is the sophmoric romantic action between the space ship Bellerophon's senior officers and daughter Altara. The behavior is so obvious and so contrived that I would have thought they could resist this easy business. But, they did not, and it does not one wit to move the story along. The rather amusing little encounter between the stereotyped ship's cook and Robbie makes a bigger contribution to the story than these romantic interests.<br /><br />These are merely surface defects which I have been able to overlook through several viewings over the course of my life. It has only been on this latest viewing that they stick out from the otherwise remarkable quality of the movie. The heart of the movie is the basic premise of the Krell, their fantastic power sources and machines built into the heart of the planet, their effort to free themselves from material form, and their distruction upon unleashing hidden powers from the very Freudian notion of the id, short for libido. As long as you are willing to buy into this premise, things go smoothly, but once you start thinking this through, the premise falls apart. But, this is sci-fi, after all, where time travel and faster than light travel are possible, so sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />A tarnished jewel of a movie, one of the very few `50s sci-fi works which deserve to be watched today.</p></body></html>

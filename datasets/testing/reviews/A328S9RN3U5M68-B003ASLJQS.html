<meta name="summary" content="A Staggeringly Brilliant Achievement in American Film"></head><body><p>MYSTIC RIVER ranks with the finest films created in the past few decades.  Clint Eastwood directs this harrowing story with a quiet brilliance that cuts right to the message of the film: everyone has an inner darkness which propels us to surprising acts at unexpected times.  This film is more Theater than movie in its intensity: the story and character development are primary and the visuals and camera work, though spellbindingly superb, are tools for Eastwood's commitment to finding the psychological core of every aspect of a group of people whose lives intersect in this almost unbearably bitter bit of truth.<p>Three boys playing street hockey on the neighborhood street in the Flats near Boston share a commitment and comraderie that is so strong that it doesn't need dialogue. During a simple act of mini-vandalism (writing their names - Jimmy, Sean, Dave - in the wet cement of their neighborhood sidewalk), one of the three is 'hauled away' by what appears to be a cop but in reality is a pedophile who subjects young Dave to four days of catpture and molestation.  Flash to the present and the three bonded boys are now middle-aged men who have little contact with each other and even less in common.  The mature Dave is haunted by his past which is never discussed but left to fester as a poisonous nidus.  Jimmy is an ex-con who operates a gang-like existance and Sean is a Boston cop whose wife has deserted him for reasons unknown.  The three are brought back together by the murder of Jimmy's daughter leading to a series of events and consequences which bring to the surface all the damage inflicted by the encounter that opens the story.  The suspense and development of the crime investigation are so razor sharp that revealing the ending would be a crime against those who have not yet experienced this movie.<p>The cast is impeccable and under Eastwood's direction gives some of the most thoroughly realized, brilliant performances on film.  Yes, individual performances can be singled out - Timothy Robbins as the mentally fragmented and fragile Dave is extraordinary, Sean Penn as Jimmy gives a performance of passionate power and pain and anguish, Kevin Bacon's understated protrait of Sean the investigating cop is the epitome of subtlety, Marcia Gay Harden shines as Dave's terrified, tremulous wife, and Laura Linney is steely perfection in the small role of Jimmy's embittered yet supportive second wife.  All of the cast, including Laurence Fishburne as Sean's cop partner, have successfuly adopted the Boston accent.  Every member of the supporting cast is exceptional and Eastwood knows how to pull natural acting from people whose experience is to this point limited.<p>The "look" of the film - that grimy, Mystic River grit atmosphere - is consistently captured by the cinematographer and the dialogue of the peerless screenplay never drops below perfect.  This is an emotionally devastating film to watch but, like the performance of a symphony that plumbs the depths of the soul, it is in the end an achievement that deserves a Bravo! - even in the muted silence as you exit the theater.</p></body></html>

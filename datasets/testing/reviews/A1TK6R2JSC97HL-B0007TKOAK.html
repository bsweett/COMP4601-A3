<meta name="summary" content="Why we HATE Merlot"></head><body><p>Sideways tells of a weekend road trip shared by Jack and Miles - two unlikely friends who are also borderline losers - during a pivotal weekend of their lives.  Jack, an unaccomplished actor, is about to marry a woman he doesn't really love.  Miles, an unaccomplished writer and wine enthusiast, has already lost the woman he loves, and is on the verge of having his just-finished novel rejected by his publisher.  Though trapped in an existence teaching literature to unimpressed high-schoolers, and unlikely to make an impact with his own writing, Miles is buoyed by his wine senses.  (Especially Pino, the sensitive grape that requires lots of TLC; he resolutely refuses to even look at Merlot, which seems to be the Paris Hilton of wines.)  Looking for distractions, the two drive out to California's wine country for an antidepressant-free weekend of fine wines, good food and wholesome golf.  Jack - out of a mixture of sympathy for the downtrodden Miles and his own compulsion for pleasure - is determined to have both of them...serviced.  Miles is smart enough to see through Jack's plans - which include a passionate and free-spirited winery pourer named Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and a pretty waitress named Maya (Virginia Madsen) - but lacks the force of will to object to them.  Jack won't listen to reason - even as a failed actor, he's ruled by his actor's instincts.  Of course neither Maya nor Stephanie know of Jack's wedding plans, and Miles overlooks the imminent possibility that his novel won't be published.  Jack salves his near-dead ego by feeding his passion for fine wines -sampling the finest Pinot and also sharing his intellectual love with Maya.<br /><br />Almost everybody in this flick loves wines (or in the case of Jack, he shares an emotional bond with everybody else into wines).  Happily "Sideways" manages not to become a movie about wines (like "Year of the Comet") as much as a story about people who are into wines.  We're never asked to accept the virtues of the vine as much as recognize why the characters have a weakness for it.  For its passion, "Sideways" is a soft-spoken movie that never becomes remote.  Not a laugh-riot, it does have its comic moments - mostly towards the end of Jack & Miles's strange weekend.  Giamatti works pretty well for a depressive character who seems to seek in wine what he knows he can't find in other people; Church also excels as another seemingly unsympathetic character - he lies and exploits, though it's obvious that he's the most consistent victim of his own instincts and desires; Sandra Oh rises to the occasion but gets little attention from the story; Virginia Madsen is a revelation as Maya, who seems to be as sensitive as Miles.<br /><br />It's no spoiler to reveal that nothing happens as our heroes planned, yet like a glass of fine wine, we pretty much see the end from the beginning, and savor instead the taste left between the two moments.</p></body></html>

GET SMART, the movie remake of the 1960s hit comedy series of the same name, is in no way true to the spirit of Maxwell Smart.  The original series was cute, warm, and wacky; a patriotic slap-stick comedy.  The modern day movie, GET SMART, isn't even a parody of the TV series; rather, it is a very pale and hollow interpretation of an American institution.<br /><br />Neither my husband nor I found the movie version of GET SMART to be funny.  There were maybe two spots where we actually laughed (and hence, two stars instead of one); however, most of the time, we never even smiled.  Where the original was clever and quirky, the movie is banal and pedestrian, relying on too many insipid off color or fat jokes instead of real humor.  Where the first Agent 99 truly cared about Agent 86, from the first time she met him, this Agent 99 can't stand Max and he has to fight to win her approval.  Where the original Max was bumbling and lovable, this Max is clumsy, off-putting, and very dull.<br /><br />There are times when a "stupid movie" can be really fun.  In this case, the stupid movie, GET SMART, is just plain stupid.  There is almost nothing to recommend GET SMART.  Especially since the villain is clearly telegraphed from the beginning.  We definitely will not be watching this movie again.  What a disappointment.  It could have been a movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

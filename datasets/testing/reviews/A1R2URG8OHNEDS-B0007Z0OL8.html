If you never heard of them before, they are the creators of "South Park." That is an animated show, that started off with small pieces of construction paper. This one could also be considered an animated movie, except it is done with puppets. Everyone and everything is part of this puppet world, and although the movie is about the war on terrorism, it never touches the government. There is no puppet version of President George W Bush or Saddam Hussain. This movie hits the war from the point of the actors that really think they could make a difference. Actors like Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and even Micheal Moore, who actually causes all of the trouble. The villan is even the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, who is using this actors in order to lead the terrorists to victory. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest people around right now, and everything about this movie is funny, and raunchy. The commericals don't really have anything funny, but that is because everything that is funny can't be shown on television. Everything that we think is funny, is funnier because of the puppets. They fight by bumping into each other, they could be in a serious scene, and then they walk away, but the way they walk into straight, or proper at all. You could do whatever you want with puppets. You could fill them up with as much fake blood as you want, or even liquid that looks like vomit. But, it's alot of work, and I don't think that they would ever try to do it again.<br /><br />The movie begins in Paris, and the terrorists have plotted a bomb. Luckily, Team America is ready, and they go to Paris to destory the terrorists, while also destorying Paris. They stopat nothing to defeat evil. They meet in Mount Rushmore, led by Spottswoode, and there is Carson, Lisa, Chris, Joe, and Sarah, and just as Carson proposes to Lisa, he is shot and killed by a terrorist. With the loss of Carson, they must replace him with somebody who could pretend to be a terrorist, so they hire Gary, a Broadway actor, who is known for the hit song "Everyone Has AIDS." He doesn't want the job, but when he realizes that "Freedom Isn't Free" he takes it. He dresses up as a terrorists, filled with facial hair, and heads over to the Middle East. But Kim Jong Il is really the villan, and he is using the Hollywood actors to get the terrorist activity around  the world. As Lisa doesn't want to get attached to another person for fear of losing him, strife comes to the Team America headquarters. What makes things worse is the headquarters gets hit with a bomb, and the Team America gang gets captured, and it's up to Gary to save the day.<br /><br />As I said, everything is funnier when it is done with puppets, and sex is not an exception. There is a hilarious graphic puppet sex scene that takes about forty five seconds long. It was edited a few times, so hopefully on the DVD we could see everything. This movie is not a movie where Matt or Trey voice their beliefs about the war, but it is a movie that is about them thinking that actors think they are better then everybody else, and that they know more. I love what they do to them, and I love all the movie references. I'm sure somethings went over my head, and that means other people too, but you have to always pay attention during this movie. Even the song lyrics have comedy in them, and I love the lament of Kim Jong Il. It fits it perfectly. "Team America: World Police" is a great movie, and it is the funniest of the year. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are geniuses.<br /><br />And remember. . . America! F**k yeah!<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated R for graphic, crude & sexual humor, violent images & strong language, all involving puppets.</p></body></html>

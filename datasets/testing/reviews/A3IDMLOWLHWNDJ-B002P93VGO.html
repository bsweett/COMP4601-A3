<meta name="summary" content=""Wolverine" Origin Growls But, Lacks Bite"></head><body><p>Origin story of Wolverine is a decent enough time passer but if your a die-hard fan of ole' Canucklhead you'll be in for a bit of a dissapointment (I actually give the film *** 1/2 stars).<br /><br /> Hugh Jackman, as always, is great as Logan, but, the welcome surprise for me was Liev Shreiber as Victor Creed. He easily made me forget about Tyler Mane from the first "X-Men" film. Some welcome cameos from future X-Men team members are also pretty cool.<br /><br /> The action sequences are pretty standard for a film like this.<br /> Characters square off with one another giving warnings, showing off there mutie powers & then fighting with explosions or some sort of mayhem going on around them. To me, it seems part of the origin story was left out. Rose, Logan's first true love, in the comic story, was dropped for the movie version. The Weapon X sequence, that should be a major highlight of the film, felt like it was rushed. If your a Wolverine fan this should have been the best part of the film. The battle at Three Mile Island didn't have that much spark to it.<br /><br />"Wolverine" is not a bad film at all it's just that it seems by the numbers. I wanted something new & fresh to see with this character instead, I got a new paint job with the same mileage.<br /> Arrives on DVD & Blu-Ray September 2009</p></body></html>

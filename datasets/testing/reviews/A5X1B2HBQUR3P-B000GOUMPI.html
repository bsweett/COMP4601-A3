<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick and Jack Nicholson make this film work."></head><body><p>A brilliant film of Stanley Kubrick which builds itself into a crescendo of madness, and horror borne out of the claustraphobic isolation of the family at the overlook hotel. Jack Nickolson's character "Jack Torrance" - an aspiring writer suffering from writer's block takes up an odd winter job where he has to act as a keeper for the Overlook hotel during the peak winter months when it closes down as the roadways that lead to the hotel get blocked with snow during the winter. So Jack's job is to just stay at the hotel and do some small maintenance activities that require some manual intervention. So Jack moves in with his family (wife and son) to the hotel. The Hotel has a bad and spooky history of an earlier caretaker who was on the same assignment as Jack but ended up slaying his wife, 2 daughters and himself. It was explained as a spree of killing which was caused by the intense isolation caused by being cut of from the rest of the world staying at the hotel when access to the surrounding areas are blocked out by snow , and the depression that this isolation created for the caretaker. Jack then undergoes the same symptomps as he slowly falls into the madness that his own mind creates and ends up hunting down his wife and his child. This is a real frightning and freaky movie with non existent gore save for the few illusion seens when Jack and his child see the slain ghost people. This is a cult classic that sends shivers through your spine. Best to be seen all alone when no one is in the house and after dark. And the main fuel of the movie is the spooky acting of Jack Nicholson. You are genuinely scared of the character "Jack Torrance" that he plays. He brought such a realistic madness to the role. Kubrick and Jack Nicholson make this film work.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

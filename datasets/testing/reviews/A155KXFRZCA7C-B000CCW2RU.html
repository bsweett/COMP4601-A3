<meta name="summary" content="The best Sci-Fi flick in a long time ... more like 4 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>This movie starts off a little slow as it establishes the premise. But later it has lots of action with excellent CGI effects which complement the futuristic environment. From the concept the film has a touch of "Coma" and "Blade Runner" with a superb execution making it its own. The acting is okay, and the movie is mostly carried by the concept, premise and execution of great photography and direction. It's also a smart motion picture with an actual storyline, etc. Also, many new vehicles in modified form like the Dodge Magnum and Chrysler 300 C, the Cadillac SRX, the Honda Element, etc. including some concept cars can be found in this flick. After the film ended, most of the movie goers I observed and met seemed to like this movie a lot and felt that they got an incredible entertainment experience which was well worth their money. The bottom line is that it is well worth watching this film because of the excellent concept, vision and execution, and most likely it will make it into my DVD collection.</p></body></html>

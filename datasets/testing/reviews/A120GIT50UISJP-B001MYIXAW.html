<meta name="summary" content="Touching without being sentimental, this is unlike any other vampire movie we've seen"></head><body><p>Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] is an odd, friendless boy who dreams of killing the bullies at school and keeps a scrapbook of murder and carnage. One dark night he meets a girl, Eli [Lina Leandersson], in the playground. Eli says she can't be his friend, but is lonely, too. Night after night they meet in the playground, and their friendship grows. They gain each other's trust and tell one another their secrets. Oskar, that he's bullied at school, Eli, that she's a vampire.<br /><br />Let the Right One In is perfect balance of a vampire movie and a coming of age film. Intelligent and complex, it explores the challenges of growing up as well as the struggles of the lonely vampire. Excellent performances all around, but Kare Hedebrandt is particularly good as Oskar, giving a nuanced performance as he is, by turns, drawn to his new-found friend and frightened away by her true nature.<br /><br />Let the Right One in will appear to those inside the horror community and beyond.</p></body></html>

The trailers made it look like it was going to be a fun, turn-your-brain-off suspense thriller with aliens capable of ripping roofs off houses. I dig it.<br /><br />The problem is that about halfway through it got ludicrous, and no roofs had been ripped off yet. (Except in the trailer, which committed the unpardonable sin of showing scenes from way, way farther in the movie than it should have.) After that, it just kept getting more and more ludicrous. I kept watching, though to be honest I'm not quite sure why, right up until the end. I was writing the review in my head while watching, a horrible vice of mine, and I was saying "ludicrous, but watchable." Then came the end, and my skull went "OMGWTFBBQWORSTENDINGEVAR!!1!!~!1!" Once my head cleared, I realized it wasn't, in fact, the worst ending in film history (and had, oddly, not a thing to do with barbecuing-- all films should end with a big barbecue, the world would be a much happier place if they did. But I digress.), but man, it was a stinker. Had they cut off the movie five minutes before they did, it would be ludicrous but watchable. Tacking on the final scene made it ludicrous and just plain bad.<br /><br />Telly (Julianne Moore, who needs no introduction) lost her son Sam (Mind the Gap's Christopher Kovaleski) in an airplane crash fourteen months before the story begins. She is still obsessed over his death, and her husband Jim (ER's Anthony Edwards) and her therapist, Dr. Munce (The Stand's Gary Sinise), are trying to convince her. Then, out of nowhere, something odd happens-- all the pictures and video of Sam vanish. Jim and Munce, realizing the gig is up, inform Telly that, in fact, she never had a son; the whole thing is in her head. She thinks she's going nuts until she runs into Ash (Chicago's Dominic West), whose daughter Lauren was killed in the same crash as Sam.<br /><br />All the pieces are there for a good psychological thriller. A good conspiracy film. Even a good film about alien abduction. (I know, there's never been such a beast, but there's always a first time.) This, however, is not it. It goes for all the predictable plot twists, adds car chases wherever possible, and goes for the ambiguous-yet-sappy ending that Hollywood so loves, but manages to not satisfy a single filmgoer with half a brain. If you've seen the trailers, you've already seen pretty much the entire film, and you don't have to put up with the horrible ending. **, because the first half is at least watchable.</p></body></html>

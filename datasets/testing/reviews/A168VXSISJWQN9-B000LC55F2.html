<meta name="summary" content="Is the prestige an illusion?"></head><body><p>This is a movie with a stellar cast, a good script, an intriguing premise and a lot of twists and turns. It also features a climax in which it changes from one type of movie to another. Whether this type of cross-genre transformation is a good thing seems to be very much a matter of personal opinion; some like it, some don't.<br /><br />The film is set in late Victorian England and is appropriately gloomy (I wonder if everything really was as monotone as it is always portrayed in stories about that era?). Two illusionists are battling each other to be acclaimed as the best magicians of their time. The story follows the efforts of each to outdo the other. The rivalry is not only heightened but becomes bitter when personal tragedy intervenes. One develops a trick that the other simply can't match, until.......<br /><br />And here's where the story shifts. I'm not going to give it away, but suffice it to say that the battle is won and lost by unconventional means. Does the story work? Yes, it does. Is the transformation fair? That depends on your point of view. On the whole, I tend to think it's cheating, but then stage magic is cheating anyway, because it isn't really magic.<br /><br />Watch for yourself and make up your mind. There's such a lot to like about the movie that even if you don't care for the ending you'll still have enjoyed the film, as I did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Real Razzle Dazzle."></head><body><p>In the movie CHICAGO, there is a scene where Richard Gere's character illustrates to his client how much a court room is like a circus; all you have to do is razzle dazzle them and you'll win your case. That's what CHICAGO has done with many of the critics and the Hollywood establishment; put on a great show to hide a movie that's really only so-so. ...<p>Seeing that this is a musical, the acting is top-notch because it also involves a ton of singing and dancing as well. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are getting a lot of press, but the real stars of the show are the two major male performers: Richard Gere and John C. Reilly. Gere has a solo tap dance number that is most impressive. Reilly plays the only character who is likeable and normal and his solo song "Cellophane Man" is a performance of classic showmanship.<p>The film's story cuts back and forth from reality to fantasy, making the movie difficult to follow at first. Overall the only parts of the film that I was impressed by were the first ten minutes and the last thirty minutes The hour and twenty minutes in between is rather forgettable. The film has a PG-13 rating, but actually borders on R territory; there are a lot of scenes of violence and almost all the women are so scantily clothed it looks like they are wearing thin strips of toilet paper over their most private areas.<p>I admit that the film had me wanting Roxie Hart to be proven innocent. However, in doing so, I lost respect for the movie. I've routed for the criminal before (e.g. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN), but the criminals were always likeable people who made a change of character. In CHICAGO, all of the characters (John C. Reilly's Mr. Hart withstanding) are despicable crooks. They are sleazy liars who wallow in a hedonistic lifestyle at the expense of the joy and peace of others. I left the movie somewhat depressed, feeling I had just witnessed and partaken in a movement of propaganda. I was taken in by the old razzle dazzle. My advice to others, wait until the video and DVD comes out and the buzz has died down;...CHICAGO is only so-so.</p></body></html>

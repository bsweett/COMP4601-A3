<meta name="summary" content="A Solid Adventure Flick"></head><body><p>This is the kind of stuff every kid dreams about. Having an adventure with your best friends that includes treasure, being chased by bad guys, avoiding the booby traps, and all the while having a massive blast. The Goonies is wickedly fun, includes all the above mentioned, and more. The story is built around such solid characters, characters that you see yourself in, your friends in, your family in. These everyday people are thrust into a wild adventure.<br /><br />Mikey (Sean Astin-- look at how little he is!!) and his brother Bran (Josh Brolin) live in Astoria, where their house is being forclosed on by men who want to build a country club over it. Mikey dreams of finding a buried treasure, "rich stuff," to save his house and the houses of all his friends, who are also being forclosed on. His father works in a museum and has kept priceless artifacts in the attic, where Mikey, Bran, and their gaggle of friends find a treasure map. Mikey can't resist. He has to find this treasure and find out if the stories his father told him about the legendary pirate One Eyed Willy are true.<br /><br />Joining Mikey are his hilarious friends-- Chunk, a clutsy eating machine; Mouth, the joking talker; and Data, the inventor. Andy the cheerleader and her friend Steph tag along too, mostly so Andy can schmooze with Bran. And of course, they are being chased by three inept, money hungry criminals. It's such a whirlwind adventure, so much fun, an Indiana Jones flick of sorts. There aren't that many great adventure films. This is one of the top ones of all time.</p></body></html>

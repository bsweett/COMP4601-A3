For those that are familiar with the Director's highly acclaimed "Touching the Void", "The Last King of Scotland" is depicted like a documentary with 60's grainy colour & ocassionally hand-held cameras. It's told through eyes of personal physician of Idi Amin, who happened to be a Scotsman. The movie is entitled so due to Idi's profess love of Scotland. Forest Whitaker is outstanding as the main character.  He's been known as a method actor who would BE Idi Amin himself throughout the duration of filming & he would interview Idi's family members to get his essence as right as possible.  Gilian Anderson's convincing as an English missionary doctor's lonely wife, James McAvoy who played the half man, half horse beast in Narnia is excellent in his portrayal of Idi's personal physician & so does Kerry Washington, who plays Idi's third wife. The movie has an authentic feel about it considering that it's filmed at Uganda. We must ask ourselves the purpose of having this film made.  Is it to raise awareness of the plight of Ugandans or is it simply to make a movie about a madman?  If the purpose is for the Ugandas, why is it that Uganda is still under the rule of a dictator to these days, who has reigned for the past 20 years? Perhaps, the message is the same as another movie that's in Oscar contender, Blood Diamond that "This Is Africa".  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

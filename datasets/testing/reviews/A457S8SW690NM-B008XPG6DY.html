<meta name="summary" content="What movie were you watching?"></head><body><p>I actually read the brilliant novel Derailed by James Siegel before going to see this movie. The movie stays fairly true to the movie but changes some aspects. The book and the movie are both excellent. The problem I am facing right now is that I am at a loss why everyone dissliked this movie. For all of you that say that you saw the twist coming, well good job, because I have no idea how that is possible. You might as well join the FBI and hunt down killers' next moves if you're that bright. Sure, when I saw the movie, I saw it coming..but only because I READ THE BOOK FIRST! I thought that the plot twists were ingenious and really made the movie so much better.<br /><br />Derailed's plot for one is outstanding. It's kind of like a hitchcock movie..only a newer version. Charles (Clive Owen) is a good guy. He's a good worker with a wife and a little daughter. His daughter has diabetes which makes his life sad at times but still wonderful. His daughter is wonderfully cast.<br /><br />He misses his regular train to work...gets on the next one but figures out that his wife has taken all of his moeny. So a sexy woman named Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston) pays for him. She is also married and has a daughter. They are infatuated with each other and start breaking their vows. They go to a hotel room to do you know what until a man named La Roche (Vincent Cassel) breaks in, steals their money and rapes Lucinda before the helpless Charles who's been beating up. This man decides then to blackmail them, figuring that they don't want to telly their spouses what they have done. He figured right. What comes next is an unpredictable thriller with a brilliant finale.<br /><br />Don't listen to people, this movie is unpredictable and really awesome. I've also had enough of people saying that Clive Owen's character is too weak in the movie. First of all, he's not Arnold. Secondly, it's realistic...he's getting the crap beaten out of him and is scared. That's his character for the movie and he develops throughout.<br /><br />The cast for one is outstanding notably Vincent Cassel who brings Laroche to life with extreme vivacity.<br /><br />After having read the book, this movie trully brought it to life and the cast was just as I pictured. The two leads are good and RZA surprisingly is really good.<br /><br />So please watch this awesome thriller with some huge twists that is a new kind of Hitchcock movie. And to tell you the truth, it's one of my faves of the year and one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. No, I'm not kidding.</p></body></html>

When Joal's spontaneous girlfriend decides to specifically erase memories of him after a break up, she sets off a whacky chain of events. Though science thinks it's found a way to erase painful memories, the couple discovers that maybe memories are best left alone, even if they're bad. Though the film is a drama, there is some humor thrown in. A great watch for those looking for something 'different'.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

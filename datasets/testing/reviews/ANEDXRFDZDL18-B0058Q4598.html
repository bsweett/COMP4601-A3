<meta name="summary" content="Humanity stinks, according to Hollywood"></head><body><p>A bland alien messenger Klaatu comes to earth intent on assessing humanity's worthiness. He is met with a stubborn group of American officials and a sympathetic scientist. He perceives humanity to be too aggressive/destructive to allow to continue, and thus, after reaching this judgment initiates a countdown to doomsday and begins to evacuate the animals in large spheroid arks.<br /><br />The film purports to have an environmental/pacifistic message, but I'm not clear exactly clear what Klaatu's issues really are.  The film doesn't go into detail about why we are bad. It seems mankind is too industrial? Too inclined to violence? At any rate, the aliens want us to 'change or die.'  Nice and enlightened. Tyranny, for a good cause is still tyranny. Guess the aliens haven't evolved as much as they like to think. Or maybe they just want to colonize our planet and decide to give us a good scolding first to let us know why.<br /><br />The film's sermony message about how bad we all are, how violent, how destructive was conveniently one-sided. The alien, assuming it is a trained observer gets an F in my book for its sense of observation.<br /><br />I DID liked Jaden Smith as the main protagonist's stepson.  I also thought Bates was good as the government official. Reeves did his usual wooden doll act, which for this film was fine.<br /><br />The film's special effects were good but the script was banal and lacking in complexity or depth. For this reason, I detracted a star and give it 2 stars.</p></body></html>

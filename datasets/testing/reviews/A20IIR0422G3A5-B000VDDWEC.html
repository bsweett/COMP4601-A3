<meta name="summary" content="Much more 'Lord of the Flies' than 'Day of the Dead'"></head><body><p>The post apocalyptic story of Danny Boyle's movie '28 Days Later' seems to borrow from just about every other film of this genre, including `On the Beach', `The Stand', `Damnation Alley', `The Andromeda Strain', `Lord of the Flies', `The Omega Man', `The Twelve Monkeys' and the `...Living Dead' movies. In spite of the cribbing, the movie is better, in many ways much better than `Damnation Alley', `The Andromeda Strain', and `The Omega Man', and it equals and surpasses in many ways the `... Living Dead' flicks.<br /><br />One of the movie's strongest aspects is something it shares with `Lord of the Flies' in that it explores the behavior of normal men and women put into this very unusual circumstance, and shows that it is quite possible for baser emotions and inclinations may come through in spite of their being contrary to the well being of the entire group. In many ways, the basic premise is also more interesting than `The Stand' in that the heavy that emerges after the run of superflu is not human nature, but a supernatural evil who takes advantage of the situation. While this creates some very unusual plot lines and leaves room for human frailty to take its toll, it is not as interesting as tragedy based on purely human failings.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the movie is the improbability of its premise and the even greater improbability of civilization's reaction or inability to react to the situation. Like `The Andromeda Strain', the movie is based on a speed of infection and effect which simply does not seem biologically possible. At least in `The Andromeda Strain', the infecting agent was extra-terrestrial. Once you assume an infection that takes effect in 20 seconds, the reaction of healthy human civilization does not seem nearly as adequate as it would actually be if that situation really arose. `The Stand' makes the spread of its superflu believable because it does not have a startling effect. It starts like a simple cold, so health officials simply do not recognize the danger until it's too late and the superflu has spread too far in the general population.<br /><br />The second big improbability is the fact that no larger groups of people within the environs of London were able to create enclaves of normal people. If a squad of ten (10) soldiers could create an island of normal humans, why couldn't a battalion or a regiment or a division or even an entire army base create a similar much larger refuge and jumping off base by which they could recover control of cities after the infected people die out. It is made clear in the movie that the infected people have virtually no ability to do anything except stay out of the sun in the daytime and search out and infect normal people at night. It is clear that since they don't even seem to have any interest in eating in spite of the ample supplies of groceries in abandoned markets, they are not likely to last more than a few weeks.<br /><br />But if you are willing to buy into the two big assumptions, the story and its presentation by actors, director, and technical crew is well worth the viewing time. A bonus for American audiences is the English setting. One can get very tired of movies set in LA or LA making believe it is some other unspecified American city. One can even get tired of NY as a site of catastrophe movies. London and the English accents are a very nice change. The clever camera work in showing the infected bezerkers in a kind of jerky double speed possibly borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock's famous `Psycho' shower scene works well and enhances the sense of near helplessness in the face of the speed on onset of the infection.<br /><br />While this has many similarities with some famous horror movies, I think it is much fairer to class this as a science fiction movie, as the really interesting aspect of the movie is less the danger from the infected than it is the effect of this threat on the people we encounter as the plot develops.<br /><br />The bonus features on this DVD lists `Audio Commentary' by the director, but be warned that this is not audio commentary on the full movie. It is only commentary on a series of stills taken by photographers doing shots to help publicize the film and by continuity staff to keep makeup and wardrobe consistent from shot to shot. The comments are interesting takes on the stunts and the effort to film empty London streets and the M1 highway, but they don't give much insight into some of the basic questions in the story.<br /><br />The story has a few other contrivances, such as the decision to go through a tunnel in daylight when you are trying to escape people who can only operate in the dark, the lack of any weapons more lethal than a machete when firearms are proven effective against the infected later in the movie, and a brightly lit grocery store when previous evidence was the fact that central electricity had gone missing. Where were those deadly samurai swords when you really need them?<br /><br />These are minor quibbles and every sci-fi movie has their share. The overall effect of the story is chilling, made even more so by the reactions of the normal humans than by the actions of the infected.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all sci-fi and horror fans with a reasonably strong stomach.</p></body></html>

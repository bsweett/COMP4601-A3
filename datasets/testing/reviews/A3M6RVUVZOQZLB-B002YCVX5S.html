What, you say, a movie, not a novel?<br /><br />Yes, it's a movie, but consider: (please note that my descriptors are not definitive---the nature of the novel shape-shifts)<br />1. It acts like a novel (chapters, different settings, many characters, complicated plot lines that converge for the final unraveling--this also is not a necessity),<br />2. It "reads" like a novel (actual chapter divisions and much dialogue--neither is required),<br />3. It has a central conflict (ridding the world of Nazis, concluding with a mighty clever resolution),<br />4. It falls into its own literary genre (the re-imagination of a world event into a fantasia of Pulp Fiction proportions), sooooooo, what is it? Crime fantasy? Fantasia of evil? Revenge documentary spliced with actual footage? Historical fiction---no---make that historical fantasy? See what I mean?<br />5. It is long at two hours and 40 minutes (not all novels are long)<br /><br />OK, granted, "Inglourious Basterds" IS a movie about actual events, but ones re-imagined, re-considered, re-invented and put back together as something new. It becomes novel in that its very first scene is  bathed in quiet undertones of civilized dialog, loaded with the machine-gun staccato of impending violence. The viewer asks how? when? Then comes the blasting of visual imagery, and an escape that becomes a pivot of more violence. What is new under the sun? According to the Prophet, nothing. The theme Tarantino considers is this: What is evil? Who has it? Who does it? What are the results?<br /><br />In some ways Tarantino's script is a Picasso masterpiece: that taking apart of history, then distorting it into something new: deconstruction reconstructed. Call it Taranting. Tarantino likes to "tarant." Take something out of modern life: hits by hitmen, violence for violence's sake, mass genocide. Then take that whatever and make it into something new. It's this step that makes Tarantino so prominent and admired in film-making. Pulp Fiction becomes a philosophizing about the nature of life. Reservoir Dog becomes a caricature of man's violent nature, and Inglourious Basterds becomes a poison-dripped commentary on genocide, violence for violence's sake, a reversal of all things decent into all things evil and vile, switching making no difference especially in the character of the German SS officer.<br /><br />These reasons (cited above) are why Brad Pitt is so good in his role. He plays it with gusto, with exaggeration, with sanity swathed in insanity, with evil run amok. Pitt plays his role with exactly the right nasty machismo and vulgarity and lasciviousness required by Tarantino's taranting. He should win an Academy Award nomination (at least) for this bold acting job. Many viewers miss this point and call him a caricature, his role as silliness. I suggest: Think again. Would Tarantino allow Pitt to diss his taranting?<br /><br />As for the conclusion: It was good to see the good guys win. Wait a minute. Did they?</p></body></html>

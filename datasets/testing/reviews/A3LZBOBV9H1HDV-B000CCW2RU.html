The music by Steve Jablonsky (who did the score to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and most, recently, to "The Amityville Horror" (2005) is excellent. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore is excellent. The film editing by Roger Barton, Paul Rubell, and Christian Wagner is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian & Lisa Fields is excellent. The production design by Nigel Phelps (who also did the production design to "Troy" (2004) is excellent and well worthy of an Oscar nomination.

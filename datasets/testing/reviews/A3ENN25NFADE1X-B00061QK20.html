<meta name="summary" content=""One Of The Best Films Ever""></head><body><p>I started off my day watching "Spider Man", cause I was in that mood to see "Spider Man 2" again, but I decided to see "HERO". Besides I've been waiting for this film sense 2002 when the Academy nominated it for Best Foreign Film. My mother and I wanted see it, because we thought it was going to be another martial arts film. And I bet that's the way the rest of America felt.<br /><br />I was thinking "Okay another Jet Li film, nothing to worry about, I mean think about it. "Lethal Weapons 4", "Black Mask", I mean Jet Li hasn't done good movies. Man was I WRONG. This film is probably the best film of the year. The colors of the characters clothes tell us which story is real or fake. The story is told from more than one point of view. You can't tell which story is real until the ending, an ending that I will not spoil.<br /><br />The fight scenes are the best I've seen sense "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Infact this film is better than "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", the fight scenes is  the story beneath the story, not like "The Matrix Trilogy" that has mindless, mindless action and not enough dialogue.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil anything about this film. I will always see why people would say "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is way better than "Hero", I mean that film was a milestone in martial arts, but "Hero" is done in a different way, a better way.  This film is so beautiful its scary. I almost threw up seeing the beauty of this film, I wanted to pause the film so I can contemplate on what I just saw. Of course I'm still wondering which story was real or fake, but that's just a minor flaw. I LOVE THIS FILM.<br /><br />P.S. I forgot to give credit to Zhang Yimou and Zhang Ziyi. Yimou, you are one of the best directors in the business. Ziyi, you are a great actress.</p></body></html>

There was just one superhero film I'd never seen - the original superhero film, without which we would have no "Batman Begins", no "X-Men", no "Spider-Man".  I needed to see "Superman".<br /><br />The film begins on the planet of Krypton, where Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sentences three criminals to banishment.  Jor-El is aware that Krypton is about to be destroyed, but the Kryptonian elders refuse to believe him.  Moments before the planet is destroyed, Jor-El sends his one child, Kal-El, to Earth.<br /><br />Kal-El's spaceship crashes in Smallville, Kansas, where he is adopted by the loving Kent family (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford).  We flash forward to Kal-El - re-named Clark Kent - in his teenage years (played by Jeff East).  After his adopted father's death, Clark travels north, where he discovers the Fortress of Solitude, an enormous ice fortress where the spirit of his deceased father, Jor-El, rests.  After conferencing with his father for a long time, Clark Kent (now played by Christopher Reeve) travels to the city of Metropolis to aid humanity.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this film is such a classic.  It's spectacular.  Director Richard Donner crafts a well-told, adventurous story that held my attention from beginning to end.  Christopher Reeve was an absolutely perfect choice for Superman; the differences between his portrayals of Clark Kent and Superman are truly magnificent.  Gene Hackman is at his best as the cheery, maniacal supervillan Lex Luthor, who is aided by an enjoyably foolish Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine as Mrs. Teschmacher.  Margot Kidder does a great job of showing how head-over-heels Lois Lane is for Superman.  And Marlon Brando is terrific in his nine or so minutes of screen time.<br /><br />Another high point of the film is John Williams' fantastic score.  It's easy to hear why Williams' score is so popular amongst fans of the film.  It's everything the soundtrack to a Superman movie should be.<br /><br />The script, by David & Leslie Newman, Robert Benton, and famous novelist Mario Puzo is, at times, epic.  It's well-written, funny, and it never lets up.  It also remains quite faithful to the comics which the film is based on.<br /><br />I'm mightly glad to have finally seen "Superman".  It's a fantastic film, still ranking amongst the very best superhero films nearly thirty years later.  I can hardly wait for "Superman Returns"!<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />THE DVD: I don't normally talk about the DVD in my reviews, but I've got to this time.  This DVD is spectacular.  Along with a bunch of great special features, the film looks amazing - brand new at times!  The Surround mix is really super, although the dialogue sounds a little dull and quiet at times.  "Superman" fans are in for a major treat!</p></body></html>

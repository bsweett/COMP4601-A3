After doing that, tell them to see this movie. I was not expecting much of anything since the movie got a horrible average rating. Don't let that fool you. The movie isn't great art, but it's wonderfully put together and delivers an hour and a half of innocent entertainment. A brother and sister are traveling back home for spring break. The brother's name is Darry(Justin Long), and the sister is Trisha(Gina Phillips). Their road trip seems to be pretty typical. Playing licence plate games and talking. They seem to hit on the subject that their parents' marriage is iin trouble, and that Trish's own relationship is over. Things go horrible when a big, dumpy looking truck begins tailing them on the highway. The truck scares them a little and then moves on. The siblings later see the truck parked at an abandoned church. A strange looking figure is taking objects wrapped up in sheets and dumping them down a pipe. After another cat and mouse scene between the two cars, the two go back to investigate, thinking they were bodies and that someone else may be alive. Once they find out that it was bodies that were being dumped, Darry also discovers that there are hundreds of bodies in this basement that are preserved and sewn up. From this point on, the brother and sister team struggle to contact help and to flee from this psycho. When they have an encounter with a psychic named Jezelle(Patricia Belcher), they learn of what is really going on. This monster is a regurgating monster that needs to eat body parts to stay alive. Whatever he eats, and you know what he eats, becomes a part of him. Every 23 years, he feeds. She also tells them that whenever the title song plays, something terrible is about to happen. It all ends with a climax that takes place in a locked down police station that was exciting and shot nicely. The movie was written and directed by Victor Salva, the man who did "Powder". He has a nice eye and give us some nice shots and fun angles with the camera. He really sets the setting and makes it eerie and intriguing. The film is pretty much straight terror, but there are some comical moments spread out here and there. While it's a film that can't be taken seriously, it appears to be a fillm that was taken seriously from Salva and his cast and crew. They wanted to put together an incredibly fun, thrill ride and they have done just that. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is what it is and it does it very competently. It delivers in the 'fun' category. The monster itself is very creepy, and very nightmarish. The make-up design of the creature was very good. The acting is all pretty solid. Gina Phillips, not only being beautiful in the classic sense, was a strong heroine. She was tough and ballsy. Justin Long did a decent job as her terrified brother. Veteran actress Eileen Brennan pops up as The Cat Lady, in a set piece that's one of the better ones. Jonathan Breck plays the monster. He does a good job in bringing out the creeps in the role. The film differs from horror films of the last few years. While it was praised as being away from the "Scream" era, it really isn't. There are some lines in the film that would of been right at home in any of the "Scream" films. Plus, these are two different types of films, and shouldn't be compared. "Jeepers Creepers" was a lot better than I thought it would be. If I had listened to bad reviews and the low average rating, I would have missed out on a pretty fun and entertaining film. I was pleasantly surprised. I think any fan of films like this would be too.</p></body></html>

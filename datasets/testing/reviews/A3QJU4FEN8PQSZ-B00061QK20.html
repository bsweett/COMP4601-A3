Similar to charges of imperialism leveled at the "House of Bush". All the assassins are united and motivated by their hatred. And, it would seem, rightly so, their families/peoples having suffered losses under the Emperor's grand vision.<br /><br />However, along the way, a couple of them have second thoughts, after understanding the Emperor and his aims, and getting a glimpse of his wisdom. Who is steadfast in hatred? The woman, in unpolitically correct fashion paralleling the "girlie men" derided by the Governor of California. The irrational feminine animus who refuses to reconsider, refuses to let go of raw hatred.<br /><br />So continues the debate in film over the Presidency of G.W.

<meta name="summary" content="Another Pointless Entry In The Teen Horror Genre"></head><body><p>Here we go. Another entry into the teen horror genre, this time brought to us from down under. The movie tells the tale of three friends venturing out on a road trip to visit Wolf Creek. The opening credit montage is just vast wide shots of the outback while they drive through it, all shot with a wide angle lens. They drive their car all the way out into the middle of the outback and hike to see the massive meteor crater at the Wolf Creek hiking trail. When they come back their car doesn't start (big suprise!), and they have to spend the night. Luckily a man in a tow truck finds them and he nicely tows them back to his bachelor pad, which also happens to be in the middle of nowhere. So, he attempts to fix their car and as he works on it our protagonists fall asleep by the fire. When they wake up it's a whole different situation as they find themselves being hunted by their good tow truck Aussie friend. What follows is just pointless nonsense that is not entertaining at all.<br /><br />First of all, Ben appears to be the main character yet we don't see him for the majority of the movie. When I watched the featurette and heard the director say that he wasn't the main character I was thinking to myself "well, why did you make him appear as if he was the main character and then take him out for the entire movie until the end?". Another problem I had with the movie was it's inconsistencies with time and weather. One scene it's raining and Ben says that it'll pass in a few hours. The next seen sees Liz sitting by some rocks and it's not raining and they do no transition shots to suggest a passing of time. Also, the first time Liz wakes up and realizes she has been tied up and captured, it is dusk. The sun is starting to set and is low in the sky, and she unties herself and jumps out the window. In the time she unties herself it becomes pitch black in one minute. Then there is the whole plot of the movie, which is not scary at all and really has no logical purpose to it. This is supposedly a "true" story (what isn't these days?), but still, not everything is meant to be a film. The movie ends so abruptly, you will sit there and be like "well? Is there anything else?". It really ends in such a horrible way that it doesn't tie anything together. In fact, you feel like there is a missing second half to the film somewhere, and it isn't found in the "unrated" edition, I can tell you that. The only highlight of the film is the use of scenery to establish an atmosphere, unfortunately the score didn't support it to create a tension filled atmosphere. The music was dull and at times there were few cues that sounded exactly like Harald Kloser's score to The Day After Tomorrow. Otherwise this is an empty story that just adds another waste of time to the horror genre.<br /><br />I think the problem with horror films these days is the lack of attention to character development. All the cheap gore driven horror films we see these days are usually between 90-105 minutes in length. They quickly jump into all the death and gore, and you know what? No one cares for the characters. The acting in the film was just not anything special. Any actor could have played these empty roles, all the roles call for are wide eyed facial expressions and the ability to cry and scream. The film is trash and is not entertaining. I sometimes wonder to myself if we'll ever see another masterpiece of horror like The Shining, The Exorcist, or Rosemary's Baby.</p></body></html>

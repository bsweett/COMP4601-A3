<meta name="summary" content="Excellent!"></head><body><p>With all the hype that surrounded this movie, I thought it would not be too good, especially since I recently saw a documentary on the life of Jim Braddock.  However, this is one instance where the movie actually surpassed the hype!  This movie does such a good job depicting New York City during the Depression that I literally felt transported back in time.  The acting is great and the fight scenes are the most realistic that I have ever seen in a boxing movie (including Raging Bull).<br /><br />As most people are already familiar with Jim Braddock's life, I will not give a synopsis of the plot.  There are many heartwarming scenes especially when Rene Zellweger (Jim's wife) is helpless to take care of her child who appears to be sick with pneumonia.  Another is when Jim is desperate to get his kids back, painfully goes asking for a handout and for government assistance.  There are quite a few excellent supporting actors (the actor who starred in Sideways and the actor who played Jean Claude VanDame's friend in Time Cop) as well as the menacing actor who plays Max Baer.  You can cut the tension with a knife when Jim has to step in the ring with Baer, knowing that he recently killed two fighters in the ring.<br /><br />Not to be missed!</p></body></html>

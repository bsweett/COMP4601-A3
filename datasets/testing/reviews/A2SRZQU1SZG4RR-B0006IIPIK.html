<meta name="summary" content="Eclectic Mix of High Tech, WWII, Comic Characters & Tibet"></head><body><p>This film is an interesting mix of pre-World War II characters, reminding the viewer of entertaining cartoon-like creations. It has futuristic high tech science blended with the menace and threat of an evil scientist who is bent on destroying the world as we know it. The primary settings are: a huge city, very much like New York ... a distant unnamed island where on-going research is done by the "good guys" who have captured the giant "robots" which arrive unexpectedly and threaten the population. Later the Sky Captain and Polly Perkins the reporter explore the Himalayas specifically Shambala or Shangri-La ... because of a secret map which Polly obtained ... and due to hints left by Dexter, one of the 'good guy' researchers. They are at some point rescued by "Frankie" who it turns out is an ace pilot. Angelie Jolie very adeptly plays Frankie who is really "Franceska" ...<br /><br />Polly Perkins (Gweneth Paltrow) is a highly engaging news reporter who takes great risks to get the "scoop" of a lifetime. She couragously tracks the giant robots to write the first newspaper story about this major threat facing the population of the city. She receives a phone call to meet a scientist at the theater. He hints of secret experiments which occurred somewhere in Germany done by a scientist which are similar to the high tech threats facing the city. The good scientist disappears ... she fears he is murdered for "knowing too much" and passing it on to her. Before he died, he entrusted her with some valuable documents ... their value becomes known only later after Polly combines her efforts with the Sky Captain. The Sky Captain (played by Jude Law) zooms into view while the giant robots roam the city destroying whatever is in their path ... He flys adroitly between them, among them, adn between sky scrapers and buildings ... risking his life to discover what signals make them work. Eventually, he and Polly exchange information and reluctantly become allies in searching for the truth which lies behind the baffling robotic life-threatening menace. They have a history together ... were considered a romantic item ... but do not entirely trust each other due to some perceived let downs by each. One or the other generally holds back vital information even as they pair up to seek the truth ... It is clear from their exchanges that the film will be enjoyable and sparkling. The energy dynamics of the personalities of the characters are magnetic ... The film promises to be entertaining by the eclectic mix of unique settings, creative use of sci-fi, and the unique and complex plot that unfolds. At times there is a Matrix-like feel to the film ... the Tibetan scenes are well done. This viewer was entertained from beginning to end by the odd twists and turns of the plot which led to a climax and explosive conclusion. Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></body></html>

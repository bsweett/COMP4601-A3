But for a measly $2 a rental around here, I figured I'd grab a bunch that I didn't wanna see, because the ones I really have wanted to see have been crap, and I figured the ones I didnt wanna watch would probably become new found favorites.<br /><br />Well, this is by far NOT a new found favorite, but it was OK and seeing as how I was thinking it would probably be one I'd turn off after 30 minutes, it survived a whole screening from me.<br /><br />The humor is a little weak through a lot of the movie, but some parts got me laughing.<br /><br />Just a rental/wait for TV imo.<br /><br />The high point is what Will says to San Deago that results in him getting fired. The low point is there is a small scene with Ben Stiller. I rolled my eyes and nearly puked, is there any non-stoner comedies made in the past few years that doesn't have him in it?</p></body></html>

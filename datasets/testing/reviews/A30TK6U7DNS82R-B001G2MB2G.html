<meta name="summary" content="The Famous Five"></head><body><p>We saw this in the 3-D Imax version so don't expect me to remember much about the ending, for the lasr 20 minutes produced nothing but gasps of terror and frowns of puzzlement from our row, since the editing is so rapidfire we couldn't really tell what was happening.  I know they went to the Ministry, and that's about it!  I wish I had seen it the regular way without the 3-D glasses, then I might have been able to understand it better.  We take along Mark, an expert at Harry Potter, every time we go to one of these shows, and we are the irritating ones in the row ahead of yours who are always turning to the expert and asking, "Now who is that tall girl with the red hair?  Was she in the movie before?"<br /><br />The plot is so complicated now that ordinary notions of character development must have been the first thing the screenwriters chucked out.  We know Harry is angry, angry, angry all the time, for not only is he in a funk through most of the movie but he even has a scene where he says, "I'm angry, angry all the time!"  Everyone's trying to help, but Harry just can't see that.  He's still traumatized, I think, by witnessing the death of Cedric Diggory in the previous movie.  Pity in a way Cedric didn't stick around for book 5, isn't it, because he might have raised the beauty quotient a little.  The producers must be fairly sick the way that they bet on a whole crew of child actors and now they have to watch them turn into awkward, plain galoofs of teens, barring Emma Watson, Dan Radcliffe and one or two others (like that tall girl with the red hair).  If Emma Watson loses one more ounce however, she is going to be able to squeeze through the eye of a needle no matter how much money she has.  Rupert Grint?  Well, there may be some who find him attractive, though director David Yates seems to be averting the camera every time it pans in Grint's direction--cut!<br /><br />OK, so now can somebody tell me what was so great about that prophecy?  I could have told you what it said and I've never read a Potter book in my life.  Couldn't it have been something a little bit more gripping?  THAT'S the McGuffin of the whole movie?  No, no, no, I must have missed something while in my 3-D meltdown.  Tell me that little ball thing said something interesting!</p></body></html>

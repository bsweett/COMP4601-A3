Some scenes that reviewers thought were gratuitous are really sorties into the real world. Symbolically you let the demons come to fruition by having them come to the surface. This is not nearly as grotesque as the media hype suggested. That is a shame because it kept many people away from the box-office. This film reminds me of the reactions at the time THE FRENCH CONNECTION II was released. THE FRENCH CONNECTION II was a totally different approach to the character from that in THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle was literally out of his element and out of his country in THE FRENCH CONNECTION II. Many people expected something different just as they did here with HANNIBAL. The DVD extras are interesting to see what was left out. However why are some things left in and others left out? I think only the company that releases the film can answer that.</p></body></html>

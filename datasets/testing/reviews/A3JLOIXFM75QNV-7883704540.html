<meta name="summary" content="Boring, kids wont really get it"></head><body><p>This is an adult movie. What I mean by that is children wouldnt understand the point of this film. I mean come on, culinary art? Why would that even interest kids? It didnt even interest me and I'm 24. It wasn't funny or cute it was just odd. Of course the computer work on this is fantastic, but that is where it stops. I do not understand why so many people love this film. I was utterly bored and dissinterested in it from the beginning.</p></body></html>

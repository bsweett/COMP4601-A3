FBI agent returns after capturing Lector, to be called into duty to hunt for a killer called "The Tooth Fairy." Even though Lector is one of Hollywood's great villains and Hopkins' performance fine, it fails to deliver the chils or any surpries any way for that matter this mediccre sequel. If people were influenced by the media, every time they saw a killer like this they would comit homicide. Easily the worst entry in the series though fine in many respects.</p></body></html>

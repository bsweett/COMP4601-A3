A vital piece of the human puzzle..., the survival instinct."<br />- John tells Eric how he gets jiggy in "Saw II"<br /><br />Lackluster sequel to the 2004 original, has nothing new to add & basically feels like a derivitive video game for the X Box 360, PS 2 crowd.<br /><br />A new detective is thrown on the case of "The Jigsaw" murders & as usual, Jigsaw himself figures out who this new cop is & wants to play a deadly game with him.<br /><br />This time a group of felons, the cop had underhandly put away in the past, are kidnapped & locked in an abandoned house filled with jigsaw traps. The group must come together to overcome & survive their stay. Whats worse, is they only have two hours to escape since their is a toxic nerve agent slowly being pumped into the house that, without a cure, will turn them into a bloody soup (the cure is, supposedly locked in a huge safe. Get the combination to the safe, will get you the cure.)<br /><br />"Oh yes, their will be blood."<br /><br />Adding insult to injury the detective's son is among the group, & it's just a matter of time before the felons find out why he is among them. If the detective plays Jigsaw's game, his son will live, but, with a very short temper it's just a matter of time before the detective snaps.<br /><br />"Saw II" was immediately green lit after the first successful weekend of the original in October of '04.<br /><br />The film was put into rush mode since it had just under a year for completion & release.<br /><br />"Saw II" has no real thrills to it. The characters are cardboard & a lot of what went on the house could have been handled differently, or avoided altogether. The film is way to predictable.<br /><br />Donnie Wahlberg's character is probably one of the worst detectives in film history. If he kept his cool the film would have been better for it. Shawnee Smith's character was just lame & the ending was total bulls**t.<br /><br />The only time "Saw II" comes alive is when Tobin Bell is onscreen & thats only, roughly ten to fifteen minutes of screentime. It was a bit interesting to see the origin of Jigsaw. Bell gives a creepy vibe to the character.<br /><br />I was expecting a bit more from "Saw II", but, I should have known better.<br /><br />This game, is most definitely, over.</p></body></html>

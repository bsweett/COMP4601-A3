Now after nearly two decades in what we shall call Indiana Jones and Development Hell, the man in the fedora is back in action!<br /><br />And it is good.<br /><br />Very good.<br /><br />Not great, though. But it is better than Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, though not quite as good as the aforementioned Last Crusade. It comes close, though.<br /><br />You know the plot by now. Indiana Jones goes looking for a McGuffin, while eluding the bad-guys. A simple formual that can work very, very well indeed. It worked so well with Raiders of the Lost Ark that Roger Ebert considers it one of the Great Movies.<br /><br />As for how well it really works in this movie? Well, there wasn't anything about it I specifically disliked. Shia LeBeoff does a good job of playing a rebel without a pause. It was nice to see Karen Allen again. Jim Broadbent was good, but along with Ray Winstone, his appearance was completely unneeded, though in the case of Winstone it was interesting seeing him after seeing Beowulf. Removing his character and Broadbent's wouldn't have changed the movie in any fundamental way, though it might've streamlined things.<br /><br />Basically the only real gripe I guess I have can be summed up like this: It seemed like they were trying to hard. Like Lucas and Spielberg were saying, "Look! We can still make a movie that's good and popular! LOOK, DAMN YOU!" As a result, just about everything seemed to be set to eleven. This sometimes took the form of silly things, like someone surviving a nuke by a: hiding in a fridge, and b: being hurled miles away and not dying on impact.<br /><br />There's also the fact that there didn't seem to be any real stakes in this movie. With Raiders and Crusade you had clearly defined objects. You knew what they were and what they'd do. You knew why it would be bad if the Nazis got a hold of them. That just didn't seem to be the case here. The franchise seems to work best when looking for holy artifacts. Maybe next time we can have Indiana Jones and the Spear of Longinus?<br /><br />Despite this, it made for a good movie and I was pleased to see Harrison Ford up there doing what he does best. I'm hopeful there will be another movie, and I have great confidence that it will be even better than this one!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What's happening with Mr. Shamalayan"></head><body><p>M. Night Shyamalan broke into Hollywood with Sixth Sense and was immediately considered one of the top, young directors in Hollywood.  This was soon followed by Unbreakable, a movie that cemented Bruce Willis as one of the top actors of the 1990s.  It was also a breakthrough film for the comic-book genre.  Then came Signs and the Village, two films that though still innovative and original, had many detractors.  Finally, it seems Mr. Night's magic has run out.  Lady in the Water barely broke even at the box office, and then came the outright bomb, The Happening.  Starring two familiar, but not blockbuster names, this movie adds a twist to a well-worn genre.  A plague has hit the northeastern section of the US that causes people to commit suicide.  The movie then follows a married couple's run from the plague.  Clues are dropped throughout the movie as to the source of the plague, plants.  Quite an original idea; sounds like a great premise for a great suspense, thriller, or horror movie.  This movie is none of those.  From the opening scene, the movie is quite apparent that something is up with the plants.  And of course the plants are seen swaying in the wind right before people start committing suicide - all throughout the movie.  So there goes the suspence, the foreboding, the fear of the unknown.  Even worse is the acting.  Both Ms. Daschaniel and Mr. Wahlberg look totally fake in their roles.  So all in all, a total letdown.</p></body></html>

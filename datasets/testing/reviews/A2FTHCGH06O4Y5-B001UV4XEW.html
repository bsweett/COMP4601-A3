It wasn't.<br /><br />I stuck through it because it got a series of positive reviews, at least if you check on Metacritic, and I couldn't figure out why.<br /><br />The story is well put together and well-directed, but for me it's not funny enough to be an outrageous comedy, not charming enough to be a romantic comedy, and not perceptive enough to offer any real insights into life.  Or getting married.</p></body></html>

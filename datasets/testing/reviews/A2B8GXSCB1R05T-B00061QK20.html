<meta name="summary" content="An intimate epic"></head><body><p>"Hero" is a very ambitious film, attempting to combine quiet introspective philosophy with visually stunning action and pageantry.  It is like an intimate epic.  The scope is grand to say the least, with full armies on the march as well as intense and magical personal duels, all of which serves as decoration to the Buddhist philosophy being put forward.<p>It is very beautiful, and this is probably the first thing to be noticed.  The various elements, actors, scenery and colors all combine to create a visual splendor.  It is a very painterly movie, a feast for the eyes.  Specifically, color is used to create moods and to differentiate the various storylines.  If the visuals are painterly, then the Martial Arts are dancerly, along the same line as "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," to which inevitable comparisons must be drawn.  The actors are equally beautiful as well, and "Hero, truly a feast for the eyes, could probably be enjoyed in this manner, without any dialog. <p>Storywise, it is a variation on the familiar "Rashomon" theme of "what is the truth?"  The same story is told and re-told, each time moving closer to the purity of truth, and with truth comes enlightenment.  This is an intimate tale,  a quiet verbal duel between an Emperor, so fearsome and lonely than no human can approach within one hundred paces of him, and a nameless subject, who might just be a true hero.  Between them, a story is told of epic engagements, artists and warriors, and what is actually worth fighting and dying for.<p>I won't spoil too much of the story, as part of "Hero's" strength and insight lies in discovery.  That is not to say that it is full of surprises and twist endings, but rather that, like all Buddhist insight, the answer of the movies riddle lies as much in the viewer as in the actors.</p></body></html>

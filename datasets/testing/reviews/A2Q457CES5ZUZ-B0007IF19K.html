<meta name="summary" content="An Oscar Richly Deserved"></head><body><p>Director Taylor Hackford parlayed a biography of one of the most uniquely talented singers of the post-World War Two era alongside a commanding performance by Jamie Foxx to propel "Ray" beyond the ranks of the traditional biopic into much more, a soul searching reflection of a great performer seeking to overcome the temptations of stardom and overcome an affliction that threatens to kill him.<br /><br />In the case of musical legend Ray Charles, the superstar that Foxx plays with total conviction and unflagging energy, temptations along with the road to stardom was all the more difficult due to the singer's blindness from youth.  One of the film's most inspiring scenes unfolds when Charles's mother, at the time he is going blind, tells him that she will be his eyes and give him instructions, but only once.  She reasons that this is the way life operates; you get one chance and after that you are on your own.  This is the philosophy she repeatedly drives home when he is confronted with impending blindness.<br /><br />Using extensive flashbacks, Hackford via Jimmy White's script directs us from Charles's early roots growing up poor in rural North Florida to the pivotal period when he seeks to make his mark in music.  One city where he receives an opportunity to be heard is Seattle, where he meets a young Quincy Jones and they explore the local musical world together.<br /><br />Another important element of the film is the exploration of how Charles fought back when those around him sought to take advantage of his blindness.  He learned through experience to question the process of counting out bills in payment for his musical services after having been taken advantage of by dishonest music promoters.<br /><br />Foxx's greatest challenge, which was surmounted with believability, was getting across the tortured side of Charles resulting from his addiction to drugs.  The painful process in which, by film's end, he has thrown off the monkey from his back, is handled deftly with Foxx never going over the edge or underplaying.  The sweating and trembling appear real and one can feel the pain emanating from Foxx as he transports us into the tortured world of a man under the influence of drugs.<br /><br />The compelling performance of Foxx as a man under the influence of drugs is reminiscent of the brilliant effort of Ray Milland as a man addicted to alcohol in the sober and hard-hitting Billy Wilder 1945 drama, "The Lost Weekend," for which the British actor, like Foxx six decades later, was rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar.  The arresting performance of Foxx was reminiscent of Milland's in that, in each case, we can feel the pain of the burdened individual overcome by a potentially deadly affliction.<br /><br />Another area where "Ray" pulls no punches is in the presentation of the temptations Charles confronts when he moves into the superstar ranks.  While his loyal wife stays home and takes care of their son Charles engages in affairs with singers who perform with him, including one who has his child.<br /><br />Charles's vital link to the rapidly developing civil rights movement of the sixties is also dramatically presented.  One scene presents Charles at his most admirable when he refuses to cross a picket line and perform before a segregated audience.  Pressures are brought against him afterwards by furious music promoters, including the one on whom Charles walked out, but he admirably refuses to back down even when his career existence is threatened, confident that he is standing on the right side of history.<br /><br />"Ray" is a film with heart and soul that, through Foxx's dominant performance, gives us a fascinating look into the life of a genuine performing genius.</p></body></html>

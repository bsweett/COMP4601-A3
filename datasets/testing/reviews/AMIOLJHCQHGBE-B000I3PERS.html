He was actually a conglomeration of heroes from lore. And being such, he never really boinked the princess from England. Who the hell cares. Like Rob Roy (see the Liam Neeson movie of the same name. You'll love it) it's the MOVIE that counts. THAT's what I'm reviewing. You want true to life battle scenes. You got `em. The best you'll ever see. Not for the faint of heart. There is so much truth in the struggle of Scotland vs England. If you have ever traced your family tree back to the English Isles, you will feel the indignity forced upon Mel Gibson's Scots. If any of you have read my reviews you know I am big on cinematography and soundtrack making a movie. It does that and more. The color (everything is GREEN) is so dramatic. The backround music haunts you. The battle close-ups put you in the middle of the horribly real bloodshed. The score leads you emotionally. But the champion of all this is Mel Gibson's performance. If I didn't know he was Mad Max, I'd swear he was William Wallace incarnate. The plot takes you seemlessly from Mel as a small child whose father is killed in revolt against his land bairn, to a mature adult infuriated with the injustice of regal land owners. Tops on my list is the realistic portrayal of medieval power plays, and the way William Wallace is so naively trapped within. This is not just a Hollywood hack and slash. This is an emotional film, encompassing politics and violence in search of  freedom. Anyone who cannot feel the pain of William Wallace in this film, is emotionally dead. This movie is about impact. This is not just a guy flick. Girls watching this movie with you, will end up crying on your shoulder. And I dare you to watch this film without feeling what the director (Mel again) meant you to feel. Trust me. I am never wrong.</p></body></html>

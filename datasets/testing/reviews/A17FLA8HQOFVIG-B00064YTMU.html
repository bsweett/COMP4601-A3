<meta name="summary" content="A thriller with an attempt at character development"></head><body><p>This recent film is a thriller.  But there is something slightly different about this one.  There's a good attempt at character development.<br /><br />Jamie Fox is cast as an ordinary cabdriver.  But very quickly we see he is highly intelligent as he develops a relationship with Jada Pinkett Smith, a hard-working prosecutor who just happens to get in his cab.  It's obvious that she's a person who he'd like to see again and is delighted when she leaves him her card.<br /><br />All seems very sweet and normal and then things suddenly change.  That's when Tom Cruise, cast as a sophisticated hit man, gets into the cab.  In a very short time the cabbie is exposed to murder and violence.  Tom Cruise keeps him a virtual prisoner.  He forces the cabdriver to drive him around when he commits murders.  But every time that Jamie Fox tries to flee, there is another twist to the story.<br /><br />O.K. - the plot was silly.  I even dozed off a couple of times and it didn't matter that I missed a few details.  But I did keep watching to the inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />This is not a great film but it is entertaining.  And I was impressed by the quality of Jamie Fox's performance.</p></body></html>

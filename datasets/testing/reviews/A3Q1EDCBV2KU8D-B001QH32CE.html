A waitress that has a talent for baking pies stuck in an almost unbelievably bad and gets pregnant. Then her new OB/GYN is attractive and she starts having an affair with him.  Everyone around her is having an affair.  All she wants to do is run away from her husband.  Andy Griffith is a difficult customer/owner that befriends her and helps her out at the end.  The sad part is the writer/director and actress in this movie, Adriene Shelly has her life tragically shortened near the end of this movie, which is now dedicated to her, a movie to watch.</p></body></html>

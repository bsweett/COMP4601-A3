<meta name="summary" content="Easily Could Have Been Best Picture Too!"></head><body><p>I went to this movie on a date expecting it to put me to sleep.  Boy was I ever wrong!  This movie could have easily won best picture too.  It was so well made and Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth was not overstated.  She definitely deserved the award she won.  The movie focuses on the death of Princess Diana and how the Royal family behaved during the period immediately after.<br /><br />The movie portrayed Elizabeth as someone who stuck to tradition (heavily influenced by her mother) and had faith that by sticking to tradition, the public at large would come around and see that she was right.  Unfortunately those traditions were for a time past and no longer held in the Tabloid influenced world of today where celebrities are put under the microscope and all their actions are highly scrutinized.<br /><br />Besides Mirren, there were solid performances all around especially by the actor who played Tony Blair.  The director seemed to show that the two smartest people were Blair's and the Queen's personal assistants.  Each one seemed to give the soundest advice of all and both were highly in tune with the public at large.<br /><br />Even though I basically knew the story going in, I was mesmerized by the way this film was presented.  It should not be missed.</p></body></html>

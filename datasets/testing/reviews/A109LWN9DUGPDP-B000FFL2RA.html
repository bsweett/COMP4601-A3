<meta name="summary" content="4 for the movie 5 becouse of bad press"></head><body><p>I didn't expect much from this movie after hearing what i heard about it and for about the first 45min. or so of the film i thought the assumptions were correct but after that the movie really picks up,if you liked Troy or even Alexander this movie is better than either of those.It may start slow to tell a story but hang in there you may be pleasently surprised!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will Farrell shines as Buddy"></head><body><p>"Elf," the new Christmas family film, stars Will Farrell as Buddy, a would-be elf.  It seems Buddy was an orphan who sneaked into Santa's bag, was taken to his workshop, and adopted by elf Bob Newhart.  Now Buddy is grown up, and he goes to New York City to meet his biological father (played by James Cann), and the predictable problems of an innocent elf in the big city begin.<br /><br />Parts of this movie are very likeable:  Will Farrell is charming and likeable as Buddy.  Bob Newhart is equally loveable and funny as the Papa Elf. Ed Asner was an odd choice as a grumpy, cold, and definitely not jolly, Santa Claus.  James Cann is dull as Buddy's biological father, a serious, unscrupulous children's book publisher. The middle section of the movie, which focuses on Cann's business problems, was tedious for me.  Will Farrells' scenes are joyful, however, and his fans will certainly enjoy "Elf."</p></body></html>

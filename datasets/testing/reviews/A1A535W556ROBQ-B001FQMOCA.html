The movie takes us back to the days before Cash became the Man in Black, subjecting us to an insecure man who struggled with his marriage, love for June Carter and drug addictions, while soaring to the top of the country western charts in the late 50's.  The film is visually very satisfying to watch as Phoenix and Witherspoon subsume themselves into the roles of Cash and Carter.  There are a number of fun cameos such as Jerry Lee Lewis and a young Waylon Jennings played by his son Shooter.  The concert scenes are the most fun, as we get a sense of the road shows that were put on culminating in the immortal concert at Folsom State Prison.<br /><br />A deep sense of anger and resentment underlies Phoenix's performance, but one never really gets a full sense of the motivating reasons.  All the viewer is given are visual references to Cash's boyhood years when he lost his brother in a sawmill accident and of his father who never forgave him for leaving his brother alone.  Cash seemed to carry this with him throughout his early recording years, but the movie leads us to assume that he drew most of his music from vicarious outlets, creating the impression that this was a man that had been to hell and back and lived to tell the story, with him ultimately admitting in front of Folsom inmates that he never experienced what they were experiencing.<br /><br />It seemed that what Cash struggled most with was his newfound celebrity status, the unreciprocated love he felt for June Carter and his embattled marriage.  Unfortunately, we never see the charismatic man that thrilled audiences and fans.  Instead, we see a deeply troubled man unable to cope with his life, and June Carter eventually rescuing him from the hole he dug for himself. This movie may have been faithful to his early years, but it was sorely lacking in the energy that propelled Cash to international stardom.</p></body></html>

Widescreen is definately the way to watch these movies, as in some of the action scenes you see even more dramatic moments as well as the elaborate stage sets [Especially the underground Temple of Doom] All three movies are better quality, have better sound, and to top it all off, the extras in the set are great to watch as well.<br /><br />This four disk set includes:<br /><br />All three of the original movies<br /><br />A 127 minute documentary of the making of the movies in which interviews with actors who took part in all three movies talk about their own personal experiences and other funny stories they had during the making of the movies.<br /><br />You also even hear about the stuntmen who worked in the movies as well. They talk about the risks they took as there are many fight scenes and really hazardous moments.<br /><br />Listen to Steven Speilberg as he talks about the making of the movies, how each one was inspired by certain stories that Speilberg himself heard about that intrigued him, and how he knew that Harrison Ford was the right pick for the action hero.<br /><br />Other extras include:<br /><br />The stunts of Indiana Jones<br /><br />Music of the movie and how the famous song for Indiana Jones was discovered.<br /><br />How the sound for the action scenes were added to the movie. [for example the crack of the whip to give it a really crisp sound. and the sounds of bullets wizzing past Jones in the movies.<br /><br />Plus original trailers for the movies that took place years ago, as well as some photos of the movies and behind the scenes shots.<br /><br />This is one DVD set you need to own if you are a fan of Indiana Jones. I recommend this just for the movies themselves, but believe me you will be even more satisfied with the extras included in here!<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

It was decent, but not nearly as good as I would have hoped.  This is one of those movies I watched, kinda shrug at the end and then never watch again.  The story is okay, though I have seen it before in various degrees in other films.  The acting is good.  The directions is a bit on the slow side.  It takes forever for the payoff, and the payoff is not really worth the wait.  I would rent this before considering purchasing.</p></body></html>

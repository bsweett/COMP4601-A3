<meta name="summary" content="Don't see this after seeing 28 Days Later"></head><body><p>Throughout this film, I couldn't help comparing it to the god-awful 28 Days Later, although this is loads better. It's more realistic, but I just couldn't help thinking about the 28 Days Later plotline. (The 'zombies' - a word that is never mentioned in the movie, but is batted around constantly - are eerily similar)<br /><br />Things happen very quickly in the movie, so by the first 10-15 minutes are over, you're left wondering what more could possibly happen, and whether it will just be fillers. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed, and found the movie moved fairly quickly, with minimum slow bits (mainly happening while they're preparing to leave the mall). Compared to the original (which I haven't seen, just heard about), Zack Snyder's version seems a lot quicker, and has been updated a lot more, while inventing a new take on the original.<br /><br />The cast in this include Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and the fabulous Mekhi Phifer. I found there wasn't much character development, all the characters are very stereotypical. Ving Rhames was just thrown in as the tough cop (much like the usual roles he plays, all muscles, and a sensible head on his shoulders). And Mekhi Phifer has a heavily pregnant wife, who doesn't get that involved that much. Neither of their characters do, they just get appear in a couple of scenes, and then get brought back for a spectacular finale. You got a jerk who introduces himself as one and stays one till he dies as a zombie (with a smile on the heroine's face, of course) and a more ruthless jerk (being an armed security guy) who does a complete character flip-flop for no obvious reason - if you don't count the fascination about the sudden topic of the hour: TRUST and uou got a romance without a chance (another twist you can see coming from a mile away) between a nurse-turned-heroine and a TV-salesman keeping the cool head among them.<br /><br />In one of the most memorable scenes, complete with dark humour, Andy, the guy on top of the store opposite, who hasn't yet been bitten shoots down the gathering 'undead' downstairs because they resemble celebrities, earning points with Ving Rhames every time he guesses the right one.<br /><br />The ending kind of ruined things for me, and will probably ruin it for others too. Just when you think they've escaped the madness (although there's a feeling in the pit of your stomach that something bad is about to open), the credits roll, and we see a series of shots filmed by the survivors using a camcorder they find on the boat. There are a couple of scenes of Steve (the owner of the boat they use to escape) and his girlfriend (still left on the camera), then the survivors finding a small boat with a still-animated zombie head in an icebox, and finally them running out of gas and landing on an island where they are attacked by zombies. There are then a series of brief almost-subliminal flashes of zombies "attacking" the camera.<br /><br />Apart from the disappointing ending (I should have begged to have it switched off as soon as the credits started up), I loved this movie, although it's one of those particular movies that I wouldn't want to watch again. (Along with 28 Days Later, which I wish I'd never watched!) Not because it's a bad movie, but because it's just so shocking, and gory, that it'll stay with me for a long time afterwards. Thankfully, I didn't have nightmares or wake up screaming during the night, thanks to someone who wouldn't shift over, and kept stealing the duvet, leaving me freezing! I didn't have a chance to have any nightmares! :)</p></body></html>

This year, however, he's not feeling it. After wandering the forest, he discovers a doorway to Christmasland and, falling in love with the warmth and love there, is determined to bring Christmas to his friends - by kidnapping Santa/Sandy Claus (Ivory). The new version isn't a director's cut: there's no scenes shaved or added, but the 3D makeover adds more depth and gives a wider scope to Burton's bizarre gothic world. It's also a good excuse to fork over a tenner for a re-release. The animation is short (really short), which means it doesn't outstay its welcome or leave you with a headache (it can be a lot on the eyes at times) and you'll get to keep a cheap pair of '80s style shades to boot!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a surprise!"></head><body><p>I heard one newscaster (maybe from CNN) mention BJM but I did not know who the actors were (not even sure if John was included) nor have I seen the trailer.  So when I viewed the movie, together with my husband, it was really a pleasant surprise!<p>We all know how unique the screenplay was, no need to go into details.  &amp; all throughout the movie, I did not recognize Cusack nor Diaz, just Malkovich.  Just imagine how you can enjoy watching a movie when most of the characters seemed alien to you--- &amp; you did actually enjoy it!<p>It's funny, at the same time sad, to realize how people are so dissatisfied with their own lives &amp; would even pay to be someone else, even for a very short time.  &amp; to think that the people we admire are happy &amp; content in their shell is a big misnomer as well! Is life really that cruel that noone can find contentment in themselves?<p>Another idea conveyed in the movie is man's fear of death.  We saw how the 'old folks' evaded death &amp; their continuos search for immortality by entering &amp; hiding in another person's brain/portal, or whatever you may call it.<p>Yes, the movie is really unique.  At a glance, it is funny because the characters acted weird &amp; comic.  But at a closer look, you will realize that there are lessons/values strongly registered which the writer/creator wanted to convey to his/her viewers.</p></body></html>

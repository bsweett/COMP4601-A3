Szpilman is a classical pianist whose middle-class, affluent Jewishness is not much of a liability until the Nazis arrive. From that point on, he and his family endure the slow tightening of the Nazi noose -- yellow armbands and petty restrictions -- leading up to the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto and the deportation of his family to the death camps.<br /><br />Like many Holocaust films, "The Pianist" fails to serve up the raw terror of the times. We are asked to view terrible scenes of mad cruelty, but as viewers, we are too detached to actually feel the unending sense of dread that must have been part and parcel of everyday life. It may be too much to ask a film to do this for us, but they must at least try.<br /><br />"The Pianist" is quite true to its namesake book. Both serve up hellish ad bizarre images that if they were not witnessed, would not be believed. The Polish partisan shot in the back and slumping to her knees in the street; the communion-like division of a tiny dime-candy among 6 doomed people; the Bizarre Waltz forced by bored Nazi guards on Jews waiting to cross a barred street; the young lad beaten to death trying to crawl through a storm drain; starving elderly Jewish workers fighting over a pot of beans. These are powerful images that convince because of their relative insignificance. The Holocaust and resistance were a compendium of such small yet telling moments of horror.<br /><br />While Adrian Brody well deserved the best-actor Oscar for this film, "The Pianist" is an extraordinary ensemble movie. Szpilman's family is very real -- by turns bickering, calming, worrying, sharing. Thomas Kretschmann, who plays German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, is extraordinary in his depiction of a man torn between duty and humanity. The Pianist brings to the screen the memories of a man who survived two of the most extraordinary events of the war -- the liquidation of the ghetto and the Warsaw uprising. It's a testament to the thousands and millions who played their small parts in a gigantic drama that shaped the last century.</p></body></html>

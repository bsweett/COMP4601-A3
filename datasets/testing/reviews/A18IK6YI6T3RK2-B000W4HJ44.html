It was brave of Travolta, considering all the gay rumors about him.  As for the rest of the movie, I was sorta bored, I thought the score was not very good, the songs are for the most part..bad.  The choreography was first rate, how unfortunite the songs don't do the dances justice.  The girl that plays Tracy is fine, she looks the part, all chubby and height challenged, with a bit of rhythm.  The story is uplifting, I suppose, it's all P.C. and the ending is predictable..really I recommend it for one reason and one reason only: the singular Travolta...enjoy.  FYI, rent dont buy.</p></body></html>

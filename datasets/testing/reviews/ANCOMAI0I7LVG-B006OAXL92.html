Yup, I finally got around to watching this Oscar frontrunner (and winner of 5 Oscars) and I must say that I was wholly satisfied.  It is magically and charming and entertaining and really a very fun and inspired ode to filmmaking in general, and it is easy to see Martin Scorsese the man coming through in almost every frame.  This is a family film, for sure, but it has so much maturity and depth of spirit that it doesn't feel like a children's film.<br /><br />`Hugo' tells the story of orphan Hugo Cabret.  Hugo's father passed away and since his death Hugo has been living with his drunkard uncle and working the clocks at a train station.  His uncle has disappeared and Hugo has basically been stealing for his meals and stealing for his hobby.  You see, before his father died he found an unwanted automaton and both he and Hugo were attempting to fix it.  Hugo carried on this work, stealing from a toy merchant in the train station to find little mechanics needed to complete his task.  He's soon sniffed out by the merchant and punished, made to work off his thievery, and in the process he starts to uncover a greater truth in that little automaton he held so dear to his heart.<br /><br />The `message from his father' led him to an even greater discovery.<br /><br />Visually, `Hugo' is a feast.  The Oscar winning production design is truly eye catching.  You can't help but feel consumed by the flawlessly detailed train station and the simple yet heartwarming living arrangements.  The grandeur of the movies is captured in flashbacks and set pieces alike; and the grace of center stage illuminates the film's heart-tugging finale.  I did feel that the CGI embellishments were a tad overdone.  In some of the scenes I felt like I was watching a stop motion film, and I didn't like the way it took me out of the human appearance of the film.  Some of the sequences didn't work as intended (small moments, like when Isabelle falls in the station or the sudden `belief' in Rene's eyes) but overall there is a total emersion of grace and delight that overtakes nearly every frame of `Hugo'.  The acting is hit or miss, which is sad.  Chloe Moretz acts too hard.  You can always see her thinking about her next move.  Nothing is graceful and she holds her face in an awkward way that always tells us she's `in character'.  Asa Butterfield, on the other hand, is a wonderful actor.  While this performance was not as sincere as the one he gave in `08's `The Boy In the Striped Pajamas', he really understands how to convey emotion.  I felt that he botched his first teary outburst (pleading with Isabelle's god-mother for answers) but he nailed his final one; the most important.  Sacha Baron Cohen was awful, but Ben Kingsley was WONDERFUL.  You see, hit or miss.  It really is like that for everyone.<br /><br />As many have noted, this is Scorsese's homage to film restoration, which is his big charity these days.  I back him one hundred percent.  It is a shame when great films are lost to the rest of us.  That only breeds youth who are removed from the greatness that cinema has to offer.  I'm intent on my children growing up to appreciate film of all kinds, and so I truly appreciate the stance that Scorsese is making.  `Hugo' definitely touches upon that concern, especially in the final act.  It can get a little too direct (it almost felt like a script upheaval for a moment, to be honest) but Scorsese finds a way to balance it back out.<br /><br />In the end, `Hugo' is a delightful film.  It is flawed, sure, but it is truly a moving picture that has a sparkle one won't soon forget.</p></body></html>

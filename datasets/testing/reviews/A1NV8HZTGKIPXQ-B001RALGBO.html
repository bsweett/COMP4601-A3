So, I was quite surprised when I found to be liking the movie a lot more than I had originally intended. I am a sucker for a good adventure/action film, and who doesn't love it when it is a giant disaster flick?. Director Roland Emmerich gave us the hit "Independence Day", but then again, he also unleashed the horror of "Godzilla" on us as well. Here, he delivers a pretty solid, interesting, human, and exciting tale of mother nature gone awry. Dennis Quaid stars as Jack Hall, a climatologist working for the government, who is at odds with his son Sam, who is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The strained father and son relationship is put to the test when the earth is hit by global warming that puts everything and everyone in danger. Tornados level Los Angeles, including some nifty scenes of the Hollywood sign and Tower Records, and cause a flooding of New York City and so on. Jack is stuck in Washington D.C., and son Sam is holed up with some friends and other New Yorkers in a museum in New York City. Sam being there for a school affair with his friend, and female companion who, not surprisingly, he longs for. Other typical characterizations of people litter the crowds of trapped city goers. The first hour sets up the severity of the storms and the destruction and isolation, while the second half spends the rest of the movie with our trapped cast fighting to stay alive from the ever dangerous weather. It is nice to see Dennis Quaid in such a film. I have always liked him and his work, and have always felt he was underrated and overlooked a bit in the grand scheme of things. He's a good actor. It is surprising to see smaller, indie-type actor Gyllenhaal in one. I haven't seen most of his work, but I do like him. He does just fine here. If he had done "Spider-Man 2" because of Tobey's back injury, it might of been okay after all. Both fit pretty well here. Emmerich's movies are always made for the effects and overal epic-ness of it all, and this one is no exception. The father-son storyline isn't a new one, and there is nothing here that adds to the overused plot line, or enhances it. Surprisingly, at least to me, it wasn't tne needless, thankless, lame plot ploy that a lot of people thought it was. I liked it, and it worked for me for some reason. The effects and destruction are quite a spectacle. That is for sure. The New York devastation more so than Los Angeles or anything else. Who doesn't want to see a ship harbored in a hustling section of downtown New York?. The effects are wild indeed, but seem more settled and level than those in Roland' previous opus'. If that makes any sense. While the effects and all that are great, fun to watch, and what most people are only interested in, I found myself being more interested and involved with the second half of the film. Watching everyone trying to live, and Jack trying to trek to New York to resuce his son. Ian Hol, famous from "Alien", has a supporting role here as a Professor. Also expect to see Sela Ward, who has a rather small role as Jack's ex-wife and Sam's mother, who is trapped in the hospital she works at. And Perry King also appears in the film, albeit a small role, as The President Of The United States. It's harmless fun that is definitley fun and entertaining to watch. The scariest thing about the film is that it leaves you with a question....what if?.</p></body></html>

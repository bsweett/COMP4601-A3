<meta name="summary" content="A good sequal..is the door open for  another?"></head><body><p>This was a great sequal to the 2003 underworld.  I like how this movie managed to slide in and fill some gaps in the history of the werewolve/vampire saga, the Corvinus family legend is explained, and the father of this all is revealed. I enjoyed the camera work/computer generations melded together into some good fighting seqences.  This movie seemed to drag on and was slower to develop than the other one.  And the Sex scene was just forced in, not really nessessary.  Otherwise, check this movie out.  A must have if you liked the first one.  I just hope they don't release this as a Extended unrated version like they did with the first one...they wait about a year then boom, suprise, here it is. Hollywood did the same thing with Sin City...money hungry as they are.  anyway, check this movie out.  I honestly hope their is no sequel, the storyline may get to thin and wreck what these first two movies have for reputation.</p></body></html>

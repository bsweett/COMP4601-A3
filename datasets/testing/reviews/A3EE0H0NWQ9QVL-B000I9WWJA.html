With a wisecracking detective, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) who must crack mission impossible, everything is in place for formidable entertainment.  We start with a prisoner, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), who is a bit of a Riddler in terrorist clothing.  (To keep law enforcement distracted, for instance, asks them, "Which weighs more:  All the trains passing through Grand Station Terminal or all the trees cut down to make U.S. currency?  Generously, he offers it's a trick question.)  We're not sure what he wants, but he tells us his purpose is to rob a bank "because he can".  After that, the narrative is replaced by his actions to do just that at Manhattan's Bank and Trust.  He has quite a crew and set up as he and his cohorts enter disguised as painters.  Cleverly they knock out the cameras with infra red lights.  After terrorizing the people, he takes their cell phones, has them disrobe and makes them dress in terrorist garb, like their own.  The police in a daring rescue or capturing them upon release don't know the victims from the villains.  All the bugging is trumped in one way or another.  Just when you think the situation is thick enough, the bank executives come into the fray.  It turns out the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and his close associate, Ms. White (played with steely cool by Jody Foster) have a stake in Dalton's game.  The president has a sensitive secret which Dalton can exploit, so, while the hostage taker may not seem to be playing with a full deck, he is indeed working with a full hand.<br /><br />Intriguing through much and entertaining throughout, 'Inside Man' often is played like an inside joke, one caper that we can easily follow along.  Denzel Washington has some great, witty lines that are usually associated with James Bond or roles Bruce Willis plays.  Fun.</p></body></html>

I have to say that this movie wasn't all that bad.  John Connor, now an adult, is living in fear of the events that took place at a young age.  On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit, the T-X, (Kristanna Loken) arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines.  The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, that is sent back by the human resistance.</p></body></html>

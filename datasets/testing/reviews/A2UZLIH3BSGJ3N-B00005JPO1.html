Even with the absence of Sean Connery, it was an entertaining and enjoyable film from start to finish with plenty of Indisims. Karen Allen reprises her role as Miriam from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and that is really all of the real connection with the previous films.<br /><br />  Shai Labouf appears as a kid out looking for Indiana as he receives untimely news of his employment status at the university he teaches. Indiana's latest escapades put him in the crosshairs of the FBI and on a new mission at the same time, to find the item of interest to the Soviet Union.<br /><br />  Although I am a great admirer of Kate Blanchett, I found her character kind of silly, especially when sinking her teeth into that bottom lip for all of those wubble U's. I'm not sold as a Shai Labouff fan. I personally found his character annoying, and he really isn't that great of an actor unless he is displaying "distress".<br /><br />  He plays the panicked teenager well because of his previous roles (just watch Disturbia and Transformers, neither of which are spectacular). I think he needs to go back to acting school and stop delivering his lines like he's be shocked in the A!$^&*%^? by a cattle prod. His unfortunate Disneyification while helpful in getting him roles in Hollywood has unfortunately (again in my opinion) limited his ability and is sort of type cast as the panicked/nervous mental wreck type character.<br /><br />  Anyway, not meaning to get off track (and I don't want to give too much of the film away), Indiana Jones 4 was a great film and deserves to be seen on the big screen. You are really cheating yourself if you don't. It was great to see Harrison Ford again in a role that was made from him.<br /><br />  There's plenty of action (not to mention wise cracks) and you pretty much just have to sit back and let Indiana take you along for the ride. Despite some of the flaws (and there were some) it's a good note to end the Indiana Jones films on. Hopefully Spielberg or Lucas won't get a mid life crisis or hair-brained ideas of developing another T.V series (especially with with Shai Labouff). I honestly can't handle that kid's acting...its painful to watch and experience. Maybe he should go back to the Mickey Mouse Club?<br /><br />  So, on a final note, let the trumpets sound as Indian makes his appearance, with guns blazing and bull whips cracking for another Indiana Jones adventure, fun for all and for sure one to own. Hang on tight! Indiana is back fighting the bad guys and taking names-enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Doesn't aim high, but it hits the mark"></head><body><p>This film follows in the proud tradition of its predecessors by delivering a number of satisfyingly gory deaths embedded in a plot that is just barely engaging enough to keep you from just fast forwarding to the next killing.  If you don't get any joy from watching the painful demise of numerous characters, there is no reason to watch this film.<br /><br />Although it accomplishes its mission, I can't help but be disappointed.  James Wong and Glen Morgan did some great work on TV.  They worked on "X-Files," including "Home," the single scariest episode of that (or any?) series ever made.  They seemed to pretty much take over for the second season of "Millennium," and they hit it out of the ballpark there.  The sci-fi series they created, "Space: Above and Beyond," got off to a slow start but was really picking up by the time it was cancelled.  If they could do such a good job on television, which requires them to work faster and be more prolific, why has their cinematic output been so underwhelming?  There's a mystery for you.</p></body></html>

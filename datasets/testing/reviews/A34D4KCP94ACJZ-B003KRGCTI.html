<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining but Self-Righteous Dystopian Thriller"></head><body><p>By now, I'm sure every fan of the Fallout video games knows that the book Eli (Denzel Washington) is protecting is the Wasteland Survival Guide, while every Christian thinks it's the bible.  The Book of Eli is on the surface a great action thriller, but a major bummer of a movie in terms of its view on humankind.  It's like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307476308">The Road</a> but only it assumes humanity requires religion in order to be civilized, a point I personally despise and disagree with vehemently.  Nevertheless, if we can pretend that in this little fictional futuristic world the word of god is imperative, else we all become cannibalistic sociopaths, then the Book of Eli can be forgiven.  I on the other hand will take its fundamentally preachy storytelling into account as a stern critic. For those reasons, the movie bothered me deeply.<br /><br />The year is 2043 and the world has been a post-apocalyptic nightmare for thirty years.  Tribes roam the wasteland raping and pillaging while Eli (Washington) "goes west" with his book in his backpack and divine intervention as his protection.  Along the way he meets sexy Mila Kunis, whose acting is just above modeling; big old mean Ray Stevenson, who naturally rules every scene he is in; Tom Waits, one of my favorite musicians who becomes a futuristic tinkerer; a blind Jennifer Beals, who, like most women here is constantly the damsel in distress; and of course the always awesome baddie Gary Oldman, who does his very best Jack Nicholson while still piecing together some seriously cool villainy.  Obviously there are major spoilers here so I'll keep somewhat restrained, but Oldman's character is bent on finding the bible and using it to control civilization, while Eli hears voices that tell him to bring it elsewhere, and use it for better purposes, I guess.<br /><br />Other than my huge gripes with some of the film's messages and altogether pessimistic assumptions of human individualism, I think this was a very good movie.  The action scenes are state of the art, the sound editing is not flawless but still works, the art direction and cinematography are exactly what I want to see in this kind of movie, and the soundtrack works extremely well with everything else.  The performances of Stevenson, Oldman, and of course Denzel, are all great within this kind of movie, and maybe even a little bit beyond those expectations.  Microcosmically and more specifically in terms of its dialogue, the screenplay is also worthy of some praise.  I can even say that the unlikely twists at the end were both unpredictable and effective, however the final few seconds of the movie were not only unnecessary but actually kind of silly and out of place.<br /><br />It's a good all-around package, but if there is a niche audience hoping to see bloody machete/gun fights and some good old fashion bible-thumping, then it is going to be absolutely awesome for them.  In fact, all those Church groups that got together to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JNNDGA">The Passion of the Christ</a> should reunite for some more gore and god.  The Book of Eli requires faith in god and belief in the bible to enjoy what it is fully.  I'm not so sure I can give it more than a mixed review altogether though, because if I'm troubled by these messages I can only begin to imagine what others more critical of the institution of religion might actually think.  I'd simply like to think it's much more than the authority of the bible which makes us less primal than animals.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Movie does not know what it wants to be"></head><body><p>Basic story of outcast sixth graders bonding, learning and teaching what life is about. The Disney's and Director: Gabor Csupo's version is trying to be more than the book and came up with an artsy film that is better than most of the trash that we feed our kids today. The only problem is that the professional artsy people can do it better and the people that go for mindless graphics and fairy tail endings will not appreciate this film; it is sort of pearls before swine.<br /><br />Trying to be subtle, we get nether graphics enough to make this a moppet movie or the lack of graphic making this a philological escapist story. The images are not confined to Terabithia but to Jess (Josh Hutcherson) himself. Of course Zooey Deschanel can bring out the graphics in any of us; be sure to see her again in "The Tin Man."<br /><br />Bottom line a fairly good formula movie but not designed for the mindless. And there is nothing exceptional or surprising. When Val Lawton had to use titles like "I walked with a Zombie" and made it into a physiological thriller, Csupo snuck a physiologic thriller right under Disney's nose.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Blu-ray does not add or subtract from the movie. Of course you need to watch the extras as they do add value to the story.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010X744G">Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a></p></body></html>

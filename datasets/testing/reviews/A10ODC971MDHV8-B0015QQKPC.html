<meta name="summary" content="Apollo 13"></head><body><p>A nail-bitingly tense and heroic tale of survival-against-the-odds based on the actual Apollo 13 crisis, Howard's Oscar-winning drama rekindles the exhilarating enthusiasm the nation felt during the first flights to the moon--and also draws on the collective anxiety that pooled in the wake of the Challenger explosion. Even without this context, "Apollo 13" is a grippingly authentic story, crisply helmed by Howard and superbly acted by a first-rate cast including Hanks, Bacon, Paxton, Harris, and Gary Sinise--most of whom prepared with zero-gravity flights at the director's insistence.</p></body></html>

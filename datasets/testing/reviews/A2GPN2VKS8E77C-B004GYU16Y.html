Engaging from beginning to end. Angelina Jolie is as good here as she was in the TOMB RAIDER movies, which is very impressive. There's plenty of suspense and twists & turns. The ending will shock you. Sort of like a female version of MINORITY REPORT, starring Tom Cruise, who was originally attatched to star, but he withdrew saying that his the character was too much like Ethan Hunt from the MISSION: Impossible movies, and he was right. But Ms. Jolie manages to make the character her very own. Well-written script. Had I written it, though, I would have deleted the misuse of God's name (ie. God followed by a mild profanity), as I feel it is blasphemous. Plenty of action and suspense. I recommend it. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG. A sequel looks like F-U-N.<br /><br />Review Of SALT- Director's Cut<br /><br />The Director's Cut of SALT is a bit longer than the theatrical cut, with some additional flashback sequences cut from the Theatrical Version, some more violence, and an entirely different end for the President and Michael. Good fun, though I think that the added voiceover at the end implying Salt's death could just be a cover for a possible sequel. I prefer the open ending of the theatrical version. But see which version you like better. Unfortunately, the profaning of God's name is still present.<br /><br />Both versions of the film are rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.</p></body></html>

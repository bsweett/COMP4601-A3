A heralded "cure" for cancer ends up becoming a deadly virus that wipes out most of human life.  Worse, the virus transforms its victims into rampaging vampires.<br /><br />(Don't you hate it when that happens?)  Bummer!<br /><br />Will Smith is the sole survivor, or so he thought ... until he encounters a young woman and her child en route to a rumored survivor's colony in Vermont.  The special effects of post-apocalyptic New York City are arresting, visually evocative of the recent TV special, "Earth Without People."<br /><br />Can Smith find a cure for the virus?  Can he survive to discover it?  Will the woman and child make it to Vermont?  Will they find any "survivor colony" there or is it just a rumor?  You'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />This movie was better than I expected.<br /><br />P.S.  The German Shepherd should get the Oscar for best supporting canine.</p></body></html>

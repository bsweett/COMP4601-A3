<meta name="summary" content="Good but not Great"></head><body><p>The movie opens with Richard Norton on a stage in late 1800's Austria performing some sort of magic trick when a group of soldiers bursts in to arrest him.  The rest of the movie is a "flashback" leading up to that scene.  We find Norton's character as a boy coming across a mysterious man by a tree.  You don't know if Norton actually met him or imagined him as the guy disappears.  Norton has an interest in magic and his character meets a well to do girl who he becomes friends with.  The two sneak off together so Norton can show her his magic tricks and generally hang out (like friends in a clubhouse).<br /><br />The girl's parents infuriated that she has taken up with a "commoner" come after her.  When they are about to get caught the girl begs Norton to make them disappear.  Norton tries but fails and the two are caught.  The girl is brought home forbidden to ever see Norton again.<br /><br />Years later Norton has become a famous magician with the name of Meisenheim.  He is watched by a police chief who is somewhat of an amateur magician himself.  He is fascinated by Meisenheim and begs to be shown one of Meisenheim's tricks where he makes an orange tree seemingly grow out of a flowerpot instantaneously.<br /><br />At one of Meisenheim's shows he calls a volunteer to assist him from the audience and it is the fianc&eacute;e (Jessica Biels) of the heir to the Austrian throne.  Meisenheim realizes it is his childhood friend because she is wearing the same magic locket that he gave her when they were kids.  He becomes infatuated with her and starts to pursue her.<br /><br />Meanwhile the police chief, loyal to the Austrian heir is keeping a close watch on Meisenheim, suspecting something may be afoot between him and Biels.  The police chief has his own agenda as he was born a peasant and believes through faithful support of the heir, he can rise to Mayor when then heir becomes the next emperor.<br /><br />The rest of the movie becomes a game of cat and mouse between Meisenheim, the police chief and the heir and Biels and you are not sure if what you suspect to be is true or an "Illusion" as the title of the movie suggests.  Not really a spoiler but the real facts are only revealed in the last sequence, which seems to happen so fast that if you watched it on DVD you would need to rewind several times.<br /><br />I thought that the acting of the police chief and the heir were superb but Norton and Biel's performances were just okay.  The movie seemed to drag in parts and even when you see the explanation at the end, some of the scenes seemed to not be feasible based on the explanation given.  All in all I give it between 3 ? and 4 stars and I do agree with some of the critics that said that the special effects seemed to be low budget.</p></body></html>

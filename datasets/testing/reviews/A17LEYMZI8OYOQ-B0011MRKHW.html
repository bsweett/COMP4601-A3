<meta name="summary" content="Blanchett Is Terrific!"></head><body><p>ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE may be somewhat historically incorrect, but it is still a fascinating, extremely entertaining epic motion picture.<br /><br />Why many of the nation's critics, aside from Cate Blanchett's superb performance, didn't like it, I have no idea.  Either they have no idea what they're talking about, or I have absolutely no taste whatsoever.  Indeed, there's no other possible explanation.<br /><br />Blanchett, who may very well be the finest actress working in films today, and Geoffrey Rush reprise the roles they first played in ELIZABETH (1998).  This time out they're joined by Clive Owen, cast as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Samantha Morton as the doomed Mary Stuart.<br /><br />As in the earlier film, also directed by Shekhar Kapur, this picture is filled with of court intrigues, plus a plot by the Spanish Government and Mary Stuart to assassinate the Queen, all of which culminates with a huge sea battle and the defeat of the Spanish Armada.<br /><br />On a more personal level, the movie deals with Elizabeth's romantic feelings toward Raleigh and her anger when she learns that he loves another.<br /><br />Rhys Ifans, Jordi Molla and Abbie Cornish co-star in this excellent historical thriller.<br /><br />?

<meta name="summary" content="Gunslingers' Revenge"></head><body><p>This is an entertaining film.  There aren't any shocking plot twists, no clever surprise endings - it's just good, solid entertainment.<br /><br />There are stereotypical characters that act in predictable ways, but somehow it comes off as original and you don't mind it.  The level of acting has something to do with it, for certain.  Mark Wahlberg is great at playing a crazy M'Fer, Tyrese has come a hell of a long way with his acting abilities and Andre 3000 also turns in a solid performance.<br /><br />The movie will definitely hold your attention.  It's worth a watch.</p></body></html>

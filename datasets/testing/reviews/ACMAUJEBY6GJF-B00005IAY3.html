<meta name="summary" content="Like watching a dream..."></head><body><p>...and I have no idea how many times I've watched the awesome and stunning masterpiece "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind" indeed is. The effects (still today, and not just for its' time) somehow work to make the movie timeless, and the same with the story. How many people doesn't still look to the sky for answers of the great unknown that's above us for sure, the universe is there serving us with its' giantness and all that yet undiscovered out there making our imagination go wild -and that's what makes this movie as facinating as it still is today!<br /><br />The wondeful Richard Dreyfuss in the lead, of course it is well acted -from most of the actors at least. The locations, somewhere in Montana (?) -perfect. Beautiful pictures of the nightsky, fantastic spaceship(s), the movie is sometimes witty, sometimes sad and gripping -the story being as complex yet as simple as it is. It's the story of a family falling apart, and a story of serial of un-explainable events witnessed by a father (Dreyfuss) that drives him to do things that makes it look as if he is going insane, he becomes obsessed. And much more to that of course.<br /><br />I have no idea which version I have seen, could they not just release the extended version once and for all? That is the only stupid thing about this movie, or perhaps its' makers that is.<br /><br />Great picture, great sound (dts), legendary movie!</p></body></html>

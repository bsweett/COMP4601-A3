Anyone could watch this movie without knowing anything about him and just fall in love with the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just awesome here as Johny Cash and even puts his oscar nominated performance in Gladiator to shame. I don't know what kind of expressions the real  Johny Cash made but Phoenix literly becomes someone else here almost as if he's possessed.<br /><br />  Cash has a wife and a family and his dream job is to be a singer and after that happens his money is there to support his family but he isn't. Then he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and that complicates his marriage even more since he falls for June instantly. He gets June to to  sing with him which makes his wife jealous, especially when he starts hanging June's pictures all over the walls. On top of that he becomes a pill popper that washes down the pills with beer. Which gets in the way of his marriage, his dream job and keeping his friendship with his dream girl. All that might sound depressing but you'll feel uplifted and happy by the end.<br /><br />  Reese Witherspoon is excellent here and I hear critics say that Philip Seymour Hoffman should win for Capote and that Reese should win best actress. I agree, she should win best actres but how could anyone say she should win and that Joaquin Phoenix shouldn't ? If you listen to the real Johny Cash and the real June Carter sing in the end credits, Phoenix sounds exactly like Johny Cash. While Witherspoon just sorta sounds like June Carter but barely. I'm not knocking her performance, she has a lovely voice and great chemestry with Phoenix period. I just don't see how you could watch this movie and walk away saying that any other actor deserves the award more than Phoenix . I'd love to see them both walk away with oscars. It's their best work in their entire careers. If you don't believe me, just watch this movie.</p></body></html>

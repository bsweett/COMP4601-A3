<meta name="summary" content="What a fun movie!  Over-The-Top action with humor!"></head><body><p>How does one go about describing a movie so rarely ideal in every way?  Well, I'll do the best I can.  'Once Upon A Time In Mexico' is a fun movie.  It's "over-the-top" action is entertaining and sometimes humorous.  Johnny Depp as Sands has gone over-the-top with his character also, a US agent (CIA?) infiltrating the Mexican cartels.  (Rumor has it that Depp picked out his own dorky costumes for the role)  He wants someone to kill Marquez, because Marquez is planning to kill the president, so he meets up (forcefully) with El Mariachi (played by Antonio Bandares).  El Mariachi is a nickname, a legend, and supposedly a dead man.  Sands makes a deal with El to kill Marquez, while Sands decides to kill the cook in a tiny Mexican dive because he cooks his pork dish too well - Sands has to restore balance to the country, you see.  But Sands has done well with his choice of El, because it was Marquez who killed El's wife and daughter, and almost killed him.<br /><br />Cartel boss Barillo is played by Willem DaFoe, and his sleazy sidekick Billy is played by Mickey Rourke.  They also are involved in the plan to assassinate the President of Mexico.  Sands goes after retired FBI Agent Jorge to take out Billy and Barillo.  Does it sound complicated yet?  Yes, it is - and no, it isn't.  Basically, there's a plot to overthrow the government and everyone is involved.  'Once Upon A Time in Mexico' is the sequel to 'Desperato', but can be watched separately and stand on it's own.  It's actually much better than 'Desperato', with a lot more cheap action added.  (As a note, the scene with El Mariachi and Carolina (Salma Hayek) going out the window of a five story building chained together was shot with the actual actors and NOT stunt doubles)<br /><br />The pace is fast, furious, and fun, with lots of gunfights and bloodshed and over-the-top action.  Combined with a great cast, it gives this little adventure enough 'Ummph' to make it past mediocre into lively and well-done entertainment.  'Once Upon A Time in Mexico' is pure amusement; it has no other redeeming value.  No deep messages and no artistic awe.  It's definitely a popcorn movie, a movie to gawk at and laugh and squeal with anticipation.  Go ahead, have some fun and watch 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico'.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

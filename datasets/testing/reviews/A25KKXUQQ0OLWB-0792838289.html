<meta name="summary" content="Profound, Introspective Movie on Assassination Politics"></head><body><p>The 60s and beginning in the 50s, was the age of political assassination.  So many countries including foreign governments used assassination as part of controlling world and  national politics.  This makes the movie fascinating.  There were also instances in the Korean War of attempted brainwashing.  All governments were fascinated by the potential of psychological torture and warfare.  The Manchurian Candidate is a wonderfully made film about a group of soldiers taken prisoner in Korea then brainwashed into being Communist agents without their knowledge.  The American operatives then take hold of them to carry out an assignation of a political leader to gain power.  Very clever, wonderful performances and held back from public view for years after it was released.  Great film.</p></body></html>

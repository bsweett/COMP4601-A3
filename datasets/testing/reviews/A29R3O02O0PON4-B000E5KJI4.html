<meta name="summary" content="Director's Cut coming!!!"></head><body><p>This news is about a month old as of this writing, but DavisDVD reported on April 3rd that director Wolfgang Peterson is getting $1M and his chance to go back and put out his definitive version of this historical epic film, much like Ridley Scott did with Kingdom of Heaven and Oliver Stone with Alexander.<br /><br />Apparently, this new cut will be about a half-hour longer and be much more violent along with more sex.  (Rubs hands together...)<br /><br />It'll probably be released on home video in Sept. 2007.</p></body></html>

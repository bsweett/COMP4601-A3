<meta name="summary" content="A welcome return for DC Comics staple hero!"></head><body><p>I was not even born when the original "Superman" movies were made and released with the late Christopher Reeve, plus I've been pulled towards the Marvel Comics movies historically speaking so I didn't know what to expect with the first "Superman" movie of the 21st century, 2006's "Superman Returns". I however got lucky and was invited to see this on July 1 and ultimately in the end, "Superman Returns" has truly lived up to the great reviews that I've been reading all across the net since it's release to the theatres. Benefiting from the likes of "X-Men" movie director Brian Singer, this has turned out to be a major favorite movie of 2006 so far.<br /><br /> On the planet Krypton, Superman is sent away from there and escapes just in time before it's `sun' star collapses and then explodes in a supernova destroying the planet with it's civilization perishing in the disaster but Superman escapes and reaches earth.</p></body></html>

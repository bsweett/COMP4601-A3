Filmed with the latest special effects possible, "The Day After Tomorrow" deals with the problems of global warming and its effect on the planet. Places that never get snow suddenly become frozen with blizzards and ice, and places that are never hit with tornadoes are suddenly destroyed by the wrath of nature's wind and destruction. Starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal, the true stars of this epic are the jaw-dropping special effects: the film looks so real one has to remind themself they are only watching a movie. Sure 1970's disaster movies like "Earthquake" and "The Towering Inferno" are fun to watch, but thanks to modern technology movie makers can make the most simplest form of storytelling into a real, and sometimes, freightening experience. The DVD comes with a slew of bonuses including audio commentary and deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Child of Which Man"></head><body><p>After the triumphs of Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and his two excellent movies for children, I guess I had high hopes for Cuaron's version of CHILDREN OF MEN, and to a certain extent he overcomes the basic torpidity of its source material, PD James' futuristic 1992 novel warning of the upcoming infertility epidemic.  Cuaron plays the concomitant anti-immigrant hysteria thick and it becomes pretty much the dominant theme of the film, together with the use of torture and unjust captivity.  This leaves a few holes in the plot--or rather in the mise en scene.  In the world we see, the UK has embarked on a "Britain for Britons" political campaign in which people from every other country in the world are systematically denigrated in order to better capture and eliminate them.  In such a world, would "Baby Diego" become a natural hero--an Argentine?  Wouldn't the media focus be on the youngest-born British baby?  And yet we find out that Baby Diego is revered in England same as Princess Diana, people bringing flowers and spreading them out at Hyde Park like they did for Diana, choking up at his baby pictures as they did for Harry and Wills.  Somewhere there's a disconnect, although Cuaron's restless, inventive cinematographer rarely lets his camera rest long enough for us to ponder such subtleties--yet I think they manage to stick in one's subsconscious, burrs under the saddle, that somehow interfere with our reception of the film's many strong points.<br /><br />And those include . . . Cuaron's fluid direction, so that in the middle of epic battle scenes his camera will flutter and follow the progress of a single piece of cloth torn from a dead man's shirt across the dirty Bexhill Camp brickyard, or the scene, which could have been so groan worthy, where Michael Caine explains to Kee and Miriam what happened between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore years ago (the entire exposition), while Owen listens in, his face a rugged mirror for his pain and his unwilling rise to activism.  For in some ways it's a terribly written scene, saved by some great staging and acting, in other ways, we feel like we're watching cinema being invented all over again.  I wish Pauline Kael were alive to describe the exhilaration of watching, not a film about Abu Ghraib, but a film that dares invoke the spectacle of Abu Ghraib directly while "pretending" to be about how wonderful children are and how the sight of a human baby can reduce hardened battle veterans to genuflecting and making the sign of the cross.<br /><br />The boat thing, the baby thing, the rays of "hope" that punctuate the second half of the movie don't ring true, they aren't earned in the same way as the totalizing action of anti-immigration forces in the first half.  But that's just me and others will see this very differently.</p></body></html>

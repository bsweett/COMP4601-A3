<meta name="summary" content="An Interesting Glimpse of the Mafia and Vegas"></head><body><p>I must be blind.  I just don't see what everyone is talking about.  CASINO is not (and let me emphasize "not") Scorsese's masterpiece.  I don't mean to say that it is a bad picture by any standards, but there is much more depth in Scorsese's catalog than comes to life in this film.<br /><br />CASINO provides an interesting (and long, coming it at three hours) history of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  As in GOODFELLAS, it provides us with a window to the underworld of the Mafia and allows us all to satisfy our desires to explore that world and view it from the comfortable distance of our own homes.  The story, while based on a true account, is not an unfamiliar one to filmgoer's: the tale of two men that get catapulted into the riches and glamour of money, drugs & sex, only to be chewed up, spit out, and left for dead by the business that once supported them.  In the process, they destroy all of the relationships that are near and dear to them and wind up where the story begins.<br /><br />It may seem that I am giving too much of CASINO's architecture away.  But, Scorses wisely employs the audience in this classic storyteller's technique, informing us from the very beginning about where the story will end up (as witnessed by the car bombing of De Niro's car in the opening sequence of the film).  Moreover, and this I was less thrilled with, De Niro provides a layer of dialogue that is peppered throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I did not feel that the dialogue was effective.  Rather, it served to prevent us (in some ways) from getting wrapped up in the storyline and gave the first thirty minutes of the film (where the dialogue is most obtrusive) a bit of an "amateur" feel.  After all, how tragic can the story be with De Niro providing his own reflective commentary.<br /><br />All of this being said, I did enjoy watching CASINO.  The performances by Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (in that order) are definitely worth witnessing.  Each of them brings this story alive, despite its slow pacing.  Moreover, the story is a fascinating one, particularly if you enjoy movies about the Mafia.  However, my recommendation would be to watch GOODFELLAS first, as I believe it is a superior film.</p></body></html>

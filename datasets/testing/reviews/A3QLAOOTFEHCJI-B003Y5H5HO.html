<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies of the year"></head><body><p>Last year, the Swedish version of Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name was my favorite movie of the year.  I know, it was released in 2009, but in my area it hit theaters in 2010.  In any case, it was and is a great film.  How could it be improved and why would an American director want to try?  I was very skeptical.  American filmmakers don't usually improve on originals, but there are some exceptions.  Ironically, a recent re-do from Sweden is another example.  I loved "Let the Right One In", but thought "Let Me In" was a modest improvement.<br /><br />Director David Fincher pulls it off here as well.  There are differences between the two films but they are not substantive.  What is different is the production value.  More on that in a minute.  The opening pushes you back in your seat with Led Zeppelin's "The Immigrant Song" covered by Karen O and Trent Reznor.  It plays over a series of fluid steel grey images.  It's hard to describe, but it gets your attention.  The plot differs little from the previous movie and presumably the novel (which I haven't read).  The editor of a Swedish magazine is found guilty of liable based on questionable journalism.  His finances are decimated and his magazine is in jeopardy of going under.  Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig at his best), needing income accepts the position of biographer for one of Sweden's wealthiest men and the head of a family that includes former Nazi's in its ranks.<br /><br />Mikael's real job however is to find out what happened to the niece of the ranking family head (Christopher Plummer).  The niece who was 16 at the time of her disappearance in the mid-1960's, is believed to have been murdered and Henrik (Plummer) believes family members were responsible.  He wants Mikael to investigate.  Needing help he hires Lisbeth Salander (award-worthy Rooney Mara) who had been recommended by the family's attorney.  Mikael is unaware that she had been doing a background investigation on him as part of Henrik's vetting process.<br /><br />Mara jumps into this role with both feet, as well as other body parts, and is remarkable.  She brings a smoldering fury to the character that has sociopathic tendencies, the result of abuse as a child.  We don't know the details (next movie) but it's there.  Lisbeth is a bi-sexual wisp of a young woman.  Body piercings are in seen and unseen places, she is covered in tattoos, has a spiked haircut, bleached eyebrows and dresses in black leather (goes with her motorcycle).  It's hard not to be distracted by this exterior, but later in the film Lisbeth takes on another identity, that of a beautiful blond rich socialite and Mara pulls that off too.<br /><br />The reason the film is so noteworthy is the detail.  Set in Sweden using a mixture of European and American English speaking actors, it's hard to differentiate between native Swedes and others.  The photography is astounding.  The film jumps between urban Stockholm and a remote island, 4 hours away by train.  The film has some brutal violence, not the least of which is rape of Lisbeth by her "guardian."  This is tough to watch but if you appreciate revenge, just wait.  Another modification Fincher made involves the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth.  To put it bluntly they have more sex.  Their relationship is warming.  There is a real connection.  You can see Lisbeth changing.  She's feeling better about herself.  Mikael?  He's had a long romantic relationship with his publisher Erika (Robin Wright) and it appears that hasn't changed.  Lisbeth's long disappearance in the next film will make more sense.  Earlier I mentioned the opening song, I should add that Reznor and Atticus Ross wrote the music for this film and it fits the scenes perfectly.  This is a brilliant, well made movie with some outstanding performances and is at the top of my list for 2011.</p></body></html>

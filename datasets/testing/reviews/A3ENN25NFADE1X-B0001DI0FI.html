<meta name="summary" content=""One Of The Best Films Of 2003""></head><body><p>This film reminds me an era when Director's and Producers wanted to make an epic, didn't matter what the cost was, they just wanted to make a good film that both excites you and makes you think. Russell Crowe gives his most daring performance in years, fans of the O'Brien books thought he couldn't do a real man's performance, he was known as dreamy Russell before now. Crowe is not only being compared to Tom Hanks , but compared to the greatest actors of our time, like Tom Cruise and Sean Penn, and now he's being placed in the category of Marlon Brando and Peter O' Toole. He not only brought back the sandle movies, but now he's bringing back the swash bucklers, wow.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />The film is about CPT. Jack Aubrey(known as lucky jack), and his sidekick the doctor(Paul Bettany). They embark on a journey to hunt down an enemy ship, but this isn't the test, this is a journey of finding one's self and coming together to conquer their fears.<br /><br />"Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" is an incredible film that will entrance you into the ocean and put you into the minds of the men and CPT. Jack Aubrey. But something is missing, Paul Bettany, he's great in this film but he doesn't have the same intensity that he had in "A Beautiful Mind", or maybe he's not sopose to. Even with that flaw, this is still an acheivement, and nothing can stand in the way of the new rein of actors, and I hope to see more of this cast including Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany.</p></body></html>

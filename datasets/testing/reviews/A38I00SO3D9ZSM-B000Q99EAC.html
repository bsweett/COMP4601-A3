<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, inspiring, cliche and unbelievable."></head><body><p>Rocky Balboa captures some of the drama and spirit of the first Rocky film.  With R.B., the Rocky story comes full circle.  Unlike Rocky III and IV, which were almost cartoonish, there is real emotion and drama in R.B.  The movie is entertaining and inspiring.<br /><br />Some of the acting is good (Stallone, Hughes, Young) and some is lousy (Ventimiglia.)  [Note:  Why didn't Sage Stallone play Rocky's kid?]  The script is sufficient but a some of the dialog is embarrassing.  The emotional connections and Rocky's giant heart carry the film.<br /><br />The biggest problem with all the Rocky movies (from II forward,) is that the boxing sequences are, on some level, ridiculous.  It's nice to suspend one's belief once in awhile for the sake of entertainment, but it's almost insulting to pretend that fighters could take the types of beatings Rocky and his opponents take in these movies.  The best boxers to ever step foot in the ring couldn't wildly throw punches and take shots to the head for 10-12 rounds.  Fights just don't work that way.  Watching a 50-some year old "retired" fighter go toe-to-toe for 10 rounds with the heavyweight champion of the world, a fighter in is prime, is complete and utter farce.  For me, I would have been pleased to watch a match that was more paced and deliberate, in a word: realistic.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, it is worth watching.  If nothing else, Rocky's life lessons (never give up, believe in yourself, keep moving forward, go for your dreams) give R.B. considerable value.<br /><br />[3.5 stars]</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Musical Classic"></head><body><p>I really dredded having to watch "Mamma Mia." I heard alot of bad reviews,even my Sister hated the film,but it did make alot of money,so I knew someone liked it.<br />After seeing the movie I didn't like it either,I LOVED IT.<br />First of all,Meryl Streep can do ANYTHING.If she's in a movie,you know it has to be great.She can sing and dance like there's no tommow.<br />Its wonderfull seeing actors over 50 singing and dancing,and having fun for once in a movie.Most films have actors over 50 in the background,this one has them featured.<br /> Amanda Seyfried  has the best singing voice,and she's wonderfull in the film,but Pierce Brosnan takes alittle getting use to,but he gives it his best.<br />"Mamma Mia"is a Musical Classic  I look forward to watching again.</p></body></html>

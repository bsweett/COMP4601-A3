It still hurts when I think of that day.<br /><br />This is not a Hollywood epic. There are no big-name stars to distract you from the story. There are no monologues or dramatizations to try to frame a message or tug at heart strings. No, this movie tries to tell as accurately as possible the tale of the passengers and crew of Flight 93, the airliner hijacked by the death-worshippers of Osama on September 11th, 2001. It tells the story not in long scenes or made-up dialog but by snatches of conversations amongst the passengers and by showing the story on the ground, at Air Traffic Control NYC and NORAD's local sector command center.<br /><br />The people on that plane could have been any of us... they were just ordinary housewives, business men, retirees. They didn't ask or deserve to be placed in harm's way but it is the nature of terrorist to strike at those who have no reason to fear. Yet, when it became obvious that the terrorists had no intention of holding the passengers hostage or even of landing the aircraft the passengers fought back. They became heroes the same way many people become heroes... they overcome their fear to do what had to be done. They saved many lives that day, no one can guess how many. I can't think of a better tribute to those men and women than this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A nice little thriller to end the summer movie season - more like 3 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>This flick is certainly carried by the acting performances of the two leading actors, McAdams and Murphy. Both play excellent. In a way, this movies seems like an adaptation of a stage play, but the last part of the film, off the plane in the city of Miami, changes that idea a bit. The general plot of this film which creates the threatening situations for Lisa (McAdams) is somewhat interesting, but plays a secondary role. The emphasis is clearly on the initiations, responses and reactions of the two leading actors. The soundtrack is also well done in the beginning of this flick, but becomes less prevalent as the film moves on.<br /><br />It seems as if this movie is too short and most moviegoers may desire the film to be expanded by another 10-15 minutes. The concept of "Red Eye" is very interesting and the execution is okay, although there are some loose ends. Anyway, it's a nice Saturday afternoon flick to relax and to watch an almost "classic" thriller, while watching two first-class actors do an excellent job.</p></body></html>

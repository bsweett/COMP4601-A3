<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, scarce extras"></head><body><p>There Will Be Blood is a fantastic movie featuring one excellent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  The rest of the cast performs admirably.  Daniel Plainview is an oilman, taking his son around the country to make a bit of money.  Plainview's story is clearly the focus of the movie, and while it may take some patience, it is worth the ride.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is a mixed bag; the transfer of the movie itself is excellent, but the extras are simply not there.  There's an old film on oil that was produced by the US government, there's a 15-minute slideshow/comparison to shots in the movie, and there are a small handful of deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes are the most interesting extras, and they are all worth it.  There's an especially nice end to the second one in which Plainview expresses his opinion of Eli, the preacher.<br /><br />If extras are your thing, you may want to wait to see if they ever release a special edition.  If you just want a beautiful version of the film, pick it up.</p></body></html>

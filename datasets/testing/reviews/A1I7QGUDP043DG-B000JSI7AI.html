<meta name="summary" content="Deeply heartbreaking"></head><body><p>This film about forbidden love during a time when coming out of the closet could get you killed is truly heartbreaking.  The screenplay stayed true to the short story and the actors took on their roles with maturity and dedication.  Anyone who refers to this film as 'that Gay cowboy movie' has probably not watched the entire film.  The story goes far deeper than sex.  Excellent writing and direction as well as beautiful scenery.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Mist"></head><body><p>After a strong storm in the Maine area, the local artist Dave Drayton drives from his house nearby the lake to the supermarket with his son Billy and his arrogant neighbor, the lawyer Brent Norton, to get supplies. Along their way, they see a heavy mist and later, military convoys, police and firefighter trucks, ambulances heading toward it. While in the supermarket, a frantic bleeding local arrives crying that there is something alive in the mist and the manager closes the entrance door while the place is encased by the mist. When David, another client and two employees go to the back of the store to start the generator, they open the back-door and the cashier Norm is hold and dragged by fierce tentacles. David and the two survivors succeed to close the loading door, and when they tell the people what happened, Brent does not trust on his words and believes it is a prank and the God-fearing woman Mrs. Carmody preaches the Apocalypse and that she is the vessel of Lord on Earth. Sooner the group discovers that they are under siege of blood thirsty creatures from another dimension that have reached our planet through a window open by a failed military research. Further, the crazy Mrs. Carmody has many followers and is becoming dangerous and dangerous in her speeches. Without alternative, a small group leaded by David decides to take the chance to escape from the supermarket and reach his car, hoping to get out of the mist. "The Mist" works as well as a traditional horror movie, with several genuinely scary sequences. This is a masterful suspense/monster movie that puts an ensemble cast into the untenable situation of being in a deteriorating situation they cannot escape from. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lovely"></head><body><p>This is a lovely, heart-warming, slightly off-beat little film.  I loved the whole idea of pie-making.  Who ever has a real, home-made pie in a diner anymore?  Who even makes pies anymore?<br /><br />The story is sweet and just real enough to keep you engaged.  The actors are perfectly cast and do wonderful jobs.  It was a treat to see Andy Griffith again.<br /><br />I subtract one star, however, due to the ending.  It didn't quite add up to me.  After the long build up of the excessively tender and passionate relationship of the waitress and the doctor, it seemed awfully easy for her to end it.  The film tells us that she is so in love with her daughter that she doesn't need anyone else...except her pie making.  Hmmm.<br /><br />Still if you don't expect it to be too realistic or logical, it's worth seeing.</p></body></html>

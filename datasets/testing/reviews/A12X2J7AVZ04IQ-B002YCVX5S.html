<meta name="summary" content="Another Great Tarantino Fantasy..."></head><body><p>I've read some other reviews and I can only be perpexed. Reviews can be opinions (objective) or opinionated (subjective). My objective opinion of "Inglourious Basterds" is that I was entertained a whole lot with a very clever and original script that could only be imagined by a smart and clever person. Action was good, when necessary, and suspense was ever present; occasional humor is always a plus. Acting was generally excellent, with Christoph Waltz (as Landa) the standout. He really makes you believe he loves being evil. Tarantino's dialogue is, as usual, rapid-fire, which made some of the sub-titled portions hard to follow, but the DVD format took care of that. Period detail was excellent as was the crisp, wide-screen cinematography. I was entertained and the ending is as satisfying as any I've seen. OK, Opinionated: I think Quentin Tarantino is extremely smart, not entirely crazy, and more in touch with his ideas and material than most give him credit. Credibility be damned, he knows how to spin a tale, always original, based on his experience as a film freak. At 2 ? hours, I was never bored. A fantasy about the Holocaust (that's not "Springtime for Hitler")? Ingenious! Tarantino knows how to craft a film this crazy into an entertaining whole. He has my admiration, since "Pulp Fiction", "Kill Bill", "Grindhouse", and even "Jackie Brown". Originality isn't given enough credit in Hollywood, and, yes, Tarantino has developed a style, but that's not a bad thing. I loved his tribute to "Duel in the Sun" at the end...</p></body></html>

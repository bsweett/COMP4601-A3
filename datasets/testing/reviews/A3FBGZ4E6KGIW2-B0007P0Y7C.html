Jennifer Garner is as always a great actress and here was no exception, I believe Jen fans will be pleased.  I also believe that non-Jen fans could possibly enjoy this as well.  The extras section is full.  The best part of the movie is the ending, that is where most of the action takes place.  I would say a rental is good.</p></body></html>

I Don't Think So..."></head><body><p>You know there's something seriously wrong when you sit down to a movie that's supposed to be scary and you find yourself laughing to the point of tears. This movie was definetely just that for me when I sat down and  watched it with my friends. I had never heard of Sam Raimi or Bruce  Campbell for that matter, and didn't know what to expect when my brother  pushed play, but as soon as the Necronomicon was opened and the words were  spoken, the laughs began. The talking severed head, the exaggerated terror  of Bruce Campbell and the cheesy special effects had me rolling on the  floor, begging my brother to rewind a scene so I could watch it again. The  laughs don't stop till the end, and I beg the film industry to better rate  and classify their films. This movie is not rated R and it's not horror,  either. It belongs in the comedy section of your local video store, rated  PG-13.</p></body></html>

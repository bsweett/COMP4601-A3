<meta name="summary" content=""Kutcher is sooo Dreamy...." Another Twilight Zone ripoff.."></head><body><p>Why do people in Hollywood try to take a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone and stretch it out to almost 2 hours??<br /><br />This movie is way too long. Kutcher is brought in to draw the teen demographic but he is not the real problem; the story is too slow and does'nt cover any new ground.<br /><br />Rod Serling is'nt rolling in his grave, he is probably laughing at the ineptness of the whole film.</p></body></html>

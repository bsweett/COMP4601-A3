<meta name="summary" content="Lots of Things Going on But Not Enough Story"></head><body><p>"Oceans 13" starts with the 70-ish music and slick opening credit, both making me anticipate something thrilling and entertaining is coming in the next two hours. The film's opening sequence (after Rusty's funny ringtone) quickly moves, setting up the initial part of the story. In short in "Oceans 13" Danny Ocean and the boys come back to Las Vegas, not for money but for revenge or for too trusting Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) who was deceived and suffered heart attack.<br /><br />So far the film is great. Then always reliable Eddie Izzard arrives and I thought Ocean's plans for the casino robbery would begin immediately. However, more than one hour in, the guys are still preparing for their robbery and their plans get more and more complicated and it becomes clear that more than one big contraption is needed to do what they are supposed to do. By the time they put into practice their elaborate plans, sorry, but I lost interest.<br /><br />Not that "Oceans 13" is waste of time. George Clooney as Danny Ocean and some of his friends, especially Brad Pitt as Rusty shine with charisma, but considering their talent, that is not a surprise. Al Pacino's "villainous" casino owner is more interesting as character (with possible references to real-life persons), and so are the amusing turns from veterans like Carl Reiner and David Paymer as "V. U. P."<br /><br />Still female roles are sadly disappointing (even though I am aware the film is about "Ocean's 13"), and the scene where Ellen Barkin is seduced by Matt Damon (with a false nose) with a help of "Gilroy" is embarrassing to see. Some actors like Julian Sands and Vincent Cassel are called in, but they are not given chance to show their talent.<br /><br />In spite of its great "all-star" cast, the real star of "Oceans 13" is Steven Soderbergh's camera work and the city of Las Vegas. Soderbergh fills the screen with colors like red and gold and even uses techniques like split screen.<br /><br />"Oceans 13" is much better than its predecessor "12" but shares the same weakness as "Shrek 3,""Spider-Man 3"and "Pirates of the Caribbean," other third installments of popular series released this year: lots of things going on but not enough story in it.</p></body></html>

A fourteen year-old girl dies in child birth leaving behind a diary whose contents causes mayhem within the Russian Mob in London.  "Eastern Promises" is a good film but falls short of it's potential.  The underlying mystery is OK but nothing earth shattering.  The film has good ethnic color but doesn't shed much light on the inner workings of the Russian Mob.  The film's main strengths are terrific lead performances by Viggo Mortensen as the mysterious gangster Nikolai and Naomi Watts as a mid-wife of Russian extraction who is drawn into the sordid events depicted in the film.  "Eastern Promises" is worth checking out with minor qualification.  Not for the squeamish, though.</p></body></html>

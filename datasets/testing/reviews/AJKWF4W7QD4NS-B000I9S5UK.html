<meta name="summary" content="Could have been worse"></head><body><p>For everything that this remake of John Carpenter's low budget, character driven cult classic does wrong, it manages to do a lot right, and while it's nothing special, it could have been a lot worse.  Beginning with a slam bang action sequence that introduces us to burned out sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) who finds himself in charge of a police precinct which is about to be decommissioned.  Soon enough, crime lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), who along with his thugs (including John Leguizamo and Ja Rule), en route to prison must make an emergency stop at the nearly abandoned precinct as a snowstorm begins.  This sets up the teaming up of Roenick and Bishop, against a crooked cop (Gabriel Byrne) who will stop at nothing until Bishop, and anyone else in his way, are dead.  The overall story and plot are practically the same as Carpenter's original, but the character development is sacrificed for over the top, glossy action.  That aside, the action scenes are nicely done, and the performances from Hawke and Fishburne save this remake from being Hollywood remake fodder.  Also starring Maria Bello, Drea de Matteo, and Brian Dennehy, this new Assault on Precinct 13 makes for mindless, action entertainment; but John Carpenter's classic still reigns supreme.</p></body></html>

This is not to say that director Stephen Chow's film is a collage of other styles because he adds some of his own original fluorishes to make this a highly original work.  The title of the film is kind of a paradox because it renders in your mind a polination of seventies Kung Fu and black exploitation films which may have partially influenced Chow but not wholly.  It would also be easy to characterize this film as a parody or a satire of martial arts films but Chow has such an affinity for those films that it holds it's own with them.  Chow hits a homerun here wearing the multiple hats of actor, director, and writer.  His script is rich with characterization and the story takes enough nifty twists that it would be a disservice to reveal them here.  Where he really excels is as a visualist in both action and art direction.  Before you can say, "What was that?", another imaginative sight penetrates the screen.  If you have reservations about martial arts films and you must see one this it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="We Must Not Forget Humanity's Heroes"></head><body><p>Because . . .<br /><br />1. Future generations will need men and women of selfless courage.<br /><br />2. Our children need to be able to differentiate reality from fiction.<br /><br />3. We need to take inventory of the motives of our actions.<br /><br />4. We all need to know that heroes do exist.<br /><br />5. We must not be blind to human suffering today.<br /><br />6. We need to remember that light shines brightest in the darkness.<br /><br />7. We become better humans when we feed our souls on such stories.<br /><br />This is the type of movie I can recommend for any family to purchase.  I have a friend who is a refugee from Rwanda.  He and his family lived through this time.  They lost each other for months and miraculously found each other again.  This film helped me understand their lives better.</p></body></html>

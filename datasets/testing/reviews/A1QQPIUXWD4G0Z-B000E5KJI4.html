In addition to the bad acting, uninspiring battle scenes, and mediocre direction, the whole screenplay stands in such contrast to the Iliad or even the notion of a Greek epic that it's laughable.<br /><br />In the Iliad, most if not all the characters are tragic heroes and there aren't really any good or bad characters: all of the mortals succumb to the will of the Olympian gods.  Although the film's removal of the immortal characters was not a bad idea, the dispositions of the mortals characters were changed so much that they follow neither the plot or theme of the Iliad.  In the Iliad, Achilles worried about his fate and valor as a warrior but wasn't the type to recite that fact over and over again to every other character in the story.  Helen was beguiled by Paris and kidnapped back to Troy; she was never Paris' willing lover. Another poor arrangement is Achilles' relation to Briseis.  The movie actually combines Briseis (a girl captured by Achilles' men on an island raid and given to him as a token) with the character of Chryseis (daughter to Apollo's priest whom Agamemnon captured but returned only after he had unleahed Apollo's wrath on his army.)  The film shows Achilles having intimate discussions with Briseis about the war, politics, etc.  It's as if the film forgot that the story takes place in 1200 B.C. and not 20th century era of the emancipated woman.  As the Iliad recites again and again, a woman's place was to tend to a man's bed, spindle her loom, and care for the household.  Also given that Achilles was more fond of Patroclus than women, I don't think he would have cared one bit what his female captive thought with regards to anything other than obeying his commands.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the film leads the audience to believe that the siege of Troy was a picnic lasting only a few weeks instead of ten years.  The film has both Agamemnon and Menelaus die before or during the sack of Troy which is completely at odds with the story: this was done simply to have Helen run off with Paris again in the end.  The latter is the most stupid part of the film both in terms of plot and theme.  Even in the film, Paris is the epidemy of cowardice and is anything but manly in battle: to have him live and run off with Helen into the sunset is to make the coward the hero.  It's as if Dobbs in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" kills everyone else and runs off with the gold.  This type of plot structure is anti-climactic and undermines the entire thematic arrangement for an epic.  An epic is a hero's tale, not a coward's: to make it otherwise isn't creative, it's just nonsensical.<br /><br />The battle scenes were uninspiring while the tactics and armaments were inaccurate.  The phalanx was not a tactic used in the Iliad.  The Iliad is quite descriptive in showing that the chariot dominated the battlefield while the infantry had a secondary role.  The phalanx is a product of the citizen army of classical Greece, not the feudal armies of the Mycenean civilization.  The funniest part is having Achilles' men use a Roman "testudo" or turtle formation that didn't really come into existence until 1000 years later.  The galleys shown in the film are also from the 5th century B.C. and not the 13th century B.C.: it would be the same as depicting sailing vessels of the 18th century with the crude ships of the Middle Ages.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film is appalling in both concept and execution.  I think it all starts witht he atrocious screenplay and Peterson's desperate efforts at directing this piece of trash into something watchable.  I don't blame the actors too much for their lack of inspiration since they didn't have anything inspiring to work with in the first place.  If you want to see this film because you never read the Iliad, don't bother: this film barely resembles the story. The plot is absurd and undermines the whole idea of an epic tale.  Read the Iliad instead of watching this rubbish; it's more inspiring and Homer's battle descriptions are far more graphic than any of the action sequences in this pathetic film.</p></body></html>

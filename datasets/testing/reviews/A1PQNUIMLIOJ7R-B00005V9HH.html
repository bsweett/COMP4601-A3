<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Spacey at his best"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey is amazing throughout the entire film. His performance earned him the 1995 Academy Award for best supporting actor (although he had the most lines out of anybody). Although an independent film, word-of-mouth made the movie a box-office success, and is listed as #15 on the top movies of all time list. The R rating is due to some violence, but mostly the extreme profanity, and although the extremety of it occurs mostly in the first 30 minutes, the rest of the movie still carries a substantial amount of strong language. There is no sexuality, though. Fun and thought-provoking, the movie delivers the most incredible and creative ending that I have ever seen. I give it five stars out of five.</p></body></html>

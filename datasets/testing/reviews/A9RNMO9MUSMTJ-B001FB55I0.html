I was'nt really looking for a continuation of the<br />franchise, i just wanted to be entertained.  And that's what this movie does.<br />I found the movie had great effects, good sound and some great robots. The<br />characters in the film were interesting and the acting was decent.  I find it<br />soo weird to see a digitized Arnold near the end...but a must for the movie.<br />A keeper...good to watch multiple times.</p></body></html>

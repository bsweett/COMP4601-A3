However, since it was made by Martin Scorsese, I expect a lot more. When you are among the best directors, you have high expectations...which I felt that this movie did not fullfill. This movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it did played out over it's full length.<br /><br />Most of "Shutter Island"is pretty good, as far as the casting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are great), the scenery is effective, and the sound lends to the atmosphere.<br /><br />I just thought that the story was lame (NOTE, I am purposely not going into the plot since it will impact/reveal the mystery). When the film is all done, you feel as though you watched a "Scooby Doo" ending.<br /><br />This atmospheric movie is a weak Scorsese film. It would best be compared to "Cape Fear" whic was far more effective.</p></body></html>

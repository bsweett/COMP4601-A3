<meta name="summary" content="Why can't detention be this meaningful and FUN?!"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorites. As most people already know, this film is about a group of completely different individuals, all with their own conflicts, who have to share a Saturday in detention together. Basically, they all get to know each other, they talk about their problems, gradually help each other out and become great friends while doing so. This is one of the best films of the 80's, and, in this day and age, if there really MUST be anymore teen films, they need to give them over to John Hughes. He is one of the best. <p>This movie is superb in every way. Nothing is forced or corny (except for some of the out-dated dancing sequences) but thats about it! The performances are phenomenal, and just about everything else is, too. SEE IT if you haven't seen it already.<p>Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

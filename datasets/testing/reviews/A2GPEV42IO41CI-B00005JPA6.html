<meta name="summary" content="Breathtaking!"></head><body><p>It is 1944, and 12-year old Ofelia and her mother are going to a military outpost in the Spanish countryside to live with her new stepfather, a sadistic army captain.  There, Ofelia discovers an old stone maze that leads to an underground world of fairies and adventures while above ground, the captain is closing in on a rag-tag band of insurgents.<br /><br />This remarkable movie is alternately beautiful and grotesque, cruel and fantastic.  Ofelia's fairyland is not a cute Disney version of make-believe, but a dark and scary place and this movie is definitely not for children.  The story, in Spanish with English subtitles, is intense and exciting and held my interest every moment, blending the harsh realities of war with a child's boundless imagination. Several scenes of violence were too hard to watch, but it is nonetheless an unforgettable movie.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

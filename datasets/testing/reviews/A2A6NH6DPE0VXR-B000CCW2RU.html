<meta name="summary" content="Wow, a Michael Bay film that's actually entertaining and fun throughout"></head><body><p>Ewan McGregor plays a man who lives in a futuristic society that he believes is the world today. Everyone is lead to believe that the air outside is poison. Yet one lucky person at a time wins a so called trip to a place called the Island. McGregor uncovers that it's more like a trip to the surgery room where you're sacrificed to give someone the liver they need or any other body part. When his friend  played by Scarlett Johansson wins a trip there, he realizes he needs to get the both of them the hell out of there.<br /><br />  That's when the film turns into an action packed ride. The beginning is more of a brilliant sci-fi thriller and both parts work although they're basically like watching 2 different movies. In the outside world they realize what they've been missing. They see that the air isn't poison and that they're actually the clones of people in the real world. People who are waiting for their organs in-order to survive. Since they're clones they have feelings too and while on the run they also plan to expose the cloning facility to the entire world. Since not everyone knows about the place.<br /><br />  Michael May had some clunky and pointless car chases in Bad Boys 2 and here he gives us the best highway car chase since the Matrix Reloaded. Yet this film made farless money than Bad Boys 2 or any of Bay's other bad films when it's by far better. It's even by far the best clone movie. It's way better than The 6th Day or Godsend. If there's cloning going on so people can get a liver transplant while clones are getting false hope. The movie makes you against cloning and we know there's attempts in cloning going on since we hear it on the news from time to time. The movie gives you a strong message while being entertaining and fun the entire time. Newsday just dis-missed the film with one star but no way is this a one star movie. It is a little long but I never had a problem sitting through this film, it had my attention the entire time. It was one of the summers best and I like everyone else missed out on it to see other movies that just aren't as good.</p></body></html>

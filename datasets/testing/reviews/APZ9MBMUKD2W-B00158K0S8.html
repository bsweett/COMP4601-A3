<meta name="summary" content="A great movie about a great Officer"></head><body><p>This is one of the 1st great war movies that I had seen when I was a youngster. G.C. Scott was just wonderful as "Him".<br /><br />While it was not a perfect flick (Patton had a much higher voice, Bradley was not so a great General, wrong tanks)The overall theme and spirit captures one of our greatest Generals.<br /><br />I still feel sorry for the poor Italians and Germans who went up against this man. They never had a chance!! I just hope that Valhalla is big enough for such a man.</p></body></html>

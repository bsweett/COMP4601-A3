<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious Star Trek Spoof"></head><body><p>Galaxy Quest was a very popular TV show from the late 70's, but the actors have not been able to move on with their careers and live on personal appearances. One day, they unknowingly agree to make an appearance for real aliens, the Thermians, and find themselves in space with a race that believe the shows were real. Now, they must learn to deal with each other and technology they made up to stay alive and save the Thermians from the evil Sarris who wants to destroy them all.<p>This movie is a must for Star Trek fans, but non-Trekkies will enjoy the humor as well. It manages to make fun of every aspect of the series, including the fans, while still using these elements to further the story. The cast gives a wonderful performance as actors out of their element trying not to give away who they really are to the aliens they have befriended. I find myself laughing all the way through this movie every time I watch it. And the deleted scenes on the DVD are as funny as anything in the movie.<p>This is a pleasant comedy that should appeal to all ages. Pick up a copy and enjoy a relaxing evening is space.</p></body></html>

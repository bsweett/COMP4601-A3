Having read some reviews that said it tried too hard, was too smart for its own good, etc, I just didn't know what to expect.  I didnt' know much, or anything really, of the plot.  I'm glad I didn't and I would recommend you don't either.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me while watching Sleven was that there were a number of deaths upfront that didn't make a lick of sense.  However, knowing this kind of film, I knew that eventually the webs would tighten to explain everything.  While some reviewers are correct in saying that Lucky Number Sleven ultimately is too smart for its own good, it is still a fun, dark and violent time.<br /><br />Sleven is sleekly and stylishly directed.  The cinematography uses tricks to give a quickly moving, sleek and interesting feel.  From the beginning montage, to the end, the cinematography is visually stimulating.  As is the sets.  The wallpaper in particular caught my eye.  A mixing of classical contemporary style (as seen in the Boss' penthouse) mixing with modern designs.  Visually pleasing to say the least but also helps set up characters.<br /><br />The casting is perfect.  In fact, this is one of the first times I've seen Lucy Liu in such an effervescent and bubbily role.  It was a breath of fresh air to see her playing a non-bitchy, fun-loving person.  Her banter with Josh Hartnett provides a ton of surreal humor and situations.  Bruce Willis was terrific as the mysterious Smith, Morgan Freeman playing against his usual good guy role was terrific as was Ben Kingsley--though that's no surprise.<br /><br />I don't want to talk about the plot because that's part of the fun in these films.  I will say it is basically about Sleven being in the wrong place at the wrong time, so to speak.  And he is mistaken for his friend who owes a lot of money.  From there the plot takes off and the pacing is pitch perfect.  It's kept alive by manic energy, absurd situations and hillarious banter between the characters.  I was smirking, smiling or laughing through most of the film, even when it takes a couple turns into some darker territory.<br /><br />A dark comedy, film-noir, Lucky Number Sleven was not at all what I expected.  It was a lot better, fun and insane.<br /><br />4 stars -- above the average, mostly because of the cast and the witty repartee that actually serves a point, but it tries too hard to be placed among the Usual Suspects and Mememtos of the world.  Good humor, though.</p></body></html>

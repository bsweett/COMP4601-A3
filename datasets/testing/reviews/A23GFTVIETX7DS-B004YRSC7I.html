However, if you revel in strange realities present with artsy cinematography, then Memento may be for you.  Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a "condition" that prevents him from creating new memories, and thus he is stuck only with the person he was before his wife's brutal death.  Now, he wakes up every few minutes to a new life organized only by Polaroid pictures, notes scribbled to himself, and a maze of tattoos scrawled over his body.  Leonard believes in facts, not memories, although the viewer soon discovers just how tenuous the relationship between fact and fiction really is.<br /><br />Although the film begins at what is essentially the end, the progression is as chronologically complex as Leonard's own fractured sense of time.  The vignettes, with scenes repeated and extended, gradually build on one another to give the viewer a fuller sense of what is really happening.  In this way, the characters are plastic, changing according to Leonard's latest understanding of them and then vanishing from his consciousness.  There's Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), two people who seem both friendly and malicious. Like Leonard, we have to learn anew about them in every scene.  These puzzling glimpses begin to assemble into something larger than even Leonard is willing to admit.<br /><br />While Memento falls into the postmodern realm of filmmaking, with its use of alternate realities and means of communication, it is not as riveting as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067J1H">Fight Club (Widescreen Edition)</a> nor as humorously self-referential as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation (Superbit Collection)</a>.  Nonetheless, this film is likely to grow on viewers who appreciate the unconventional.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classical high tension drama in every sense of the word"></head><body><p>I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as I watched this 2007 electrifying crime drama which moved at the speed of light and kept me alert and at the edge of my seat for its entire length.  Directed by the then 83-year old Sidney Lumet, his master's touch can be seen throughout in this debut original screenplay by Kelly Masterson.<br /><br />The story surrounds two brothers, Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a dishonest payroll executive with a drug habit who convinces his younger brother, Ethan Hawke, to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store.  Hawke needs money badly and he agrees to the heist, enlisting a local thug.  The robbery goes horribly wrong however and what follows is high drama in every sense of the word.  Marisa Tomei is cast in the role of Hoffman's wife who is having an affair with his brother and her role just adds to the high degree of tension of the film.  Rosemary Harris is cast as the mother and Albert Finny as the father, who plays a strong and touching role as a man on a mission with a need for justice.<br /><br />How this all plays out is real and violent and ultimately satisfying as a high tension classical drama which goes far beyond the crime genre.  This is a winner in every sense of the word.<br /><br />And, by the way, the title of the film is based on an actual old Irish toast at a funeral.</p></body></html>

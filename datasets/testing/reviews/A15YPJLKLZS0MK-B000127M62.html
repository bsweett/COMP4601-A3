<meta name="summary" content="The Movie We've Been WAiting For"></head><body><p>We've been waiting for this one since like 1989. They changed this from when it first came out on video, to a much more straight forward Friday the 13th film. Jason and Freddy hack up a group of overage teens before squaring off against one another with, as I could've predicted years ago, Jason wins. They tied the two series together, it was Freddy who drowned Jason. I really liked it, but someone who isn't a diehard fan of either series might rate it poorly. It's amazing to see Friday the 13th films still being made after Jason X bombed. Robert Englund does a good job of reprising his role of Freddy Kruger, in what should be his final film.</p></body></html>

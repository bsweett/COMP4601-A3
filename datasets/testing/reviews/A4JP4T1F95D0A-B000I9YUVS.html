Most everything is much worse.  The story has been altered and most of the bite has been taken out.  The director goes for a few jump scenes, rather than making the entire movie creepy ala the Carpenter version.  The original ending was so good and dark.  This one ends with a whimper that makes no sense.  As for this being unrated, it is still a PG-13 cut.  No nudity, little swearing, and very little blood.  Stay away.</p></body></html>

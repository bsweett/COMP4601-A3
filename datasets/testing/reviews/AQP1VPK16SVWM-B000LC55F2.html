Using a magician's slight of hand to direct the audience in this intricate story about the rivalry between magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) set in turn-of-the-century England Nolan constructs a drama that deals with themes as old as Shakespeare's "The Tempest". The less you know about the plot of the film outside of what I've described the better as the film will unfold its mystery just as the best magician's tricks do with showmanship and a sense of awe. ***<br />Featuring a number of stunning performances everyone from Jackman & Bale to Michael Caine & David Bowie as Nikola Tesla one of the first men to harness the power of electricity shines in the film. Although Scarlett Johansson lights up the screen time Rebecca Hall ("Wide Sargasso Sea") as Borden's long suffering wife has the better, showier part in the film and makes the most of it.<br />***POTENTIAL SP0ILERS HERE GO NO FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO BE COMPLETELY SURPRISED BY THE FILM***<br /><br />Nolan constructs his story in flashback as we see Rupert Angier die during one of his tricks and Borden put on trial for his murder. Weaving back and forth in time Nolan paints devastating pictures of two very different driven men who use misdirection as the seeds of their lives and how that ultimately costs them both in tragic ways.<br /><br />***END OF SPOILERS***<br /><br />Based on science fiction and fantasy writer Christopher Priest's novel of the same name Nolan and his co-screenwriter/brother Jonathan Nolan (who co-scripted "Memento") do a marvelous job of keeping the audience orientated as to when the flashbacks that we are seeing took place. Since the film is less than chronological skipping back and forth (using the marvelous conceit of diaries that both magicians have kept about their rivalry, magic tricks and experiences) audiences will be very involved in putting the pieces of this puzzle together. As the tagline suggest you should watch this entertaining, clever and ambitious drama very closely as there hints throughout the film that will lead clever audience members to the conclusion before it takes place. That doesn't make the film any less satisfying however as it is a good example of modern filmmaking that doesn't place technique above content. The leap of faith necessary for the conclusion of the film will put some people off--after all it is played as a straight ahead mystery thriller for most of the film but it's precisely this unusual twist that makes the film so vital and entertaining. Certainly Nolan's dark film won't be for everyone but neither was "Momento" or "Insomnia".<br /><br />I highly recommend "The Prestige". Featuring a number of powerful, confident performances, a terrific script based on a top notch novel and sharp direction by Nolan the film continues to suggest he is one of our most talented film directors working. As with all of Nolan's previous films "The Prestige" continues to demonstrate an ambitious filmmaker whose ultimate goal is to tell an involving drama that will challenge an audience's perceptions.</p></body></html>

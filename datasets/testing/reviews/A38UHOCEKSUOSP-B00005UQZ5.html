<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] I am proud of where I live now because of this film"></head><body><p>The Fugitive is a great thriller of a movie, but holds a special place with me.  Part of this film was shot in my hometown of Sylva, NC plus many of the other surrounding areas.  This is a small town not many have heard of, small enough to be used in this film as a small town somewhere in backwoods Illinois.  I didn't know there were mountains in Illinois anyways?  The train wreck scene, which is one of the most spectacular action sequences of the film, I have had the enjoyment of seeing the preserved wreckage in person on a train ride that you can take in the area.  The scene where Harrison Ford jumps from the dam is actually Fontana Dam, located about 45 minutes west of Sylva.  Anyways, enough of the details about those scenes, but in case you were wondering, thats where they were shot.<br /><br />As a whole this movie is extremely well crafted.  You've basically got an edge of your seat thriller, updated from the 1960's tv series.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones both deliever first rate performances and have great chemistry, something that keeps this movie strong till the very end.  The story is well written and executed, and is complex enough to keep you thinking on your toes, but not too complex to ever feel left out.  The action scenes are wonderfully shot, and the chases and elements of suspense are tight.<br /><br />There's little more to say about this film, it is very good in all areas.  It doesn't contain the best story written, the best cast of characters, or the greatest action scenes of all time.  But it does have a dose of all of that, and with a very solid feel in the end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You Either Get This Movie Or You Don't"></head><body><p>This is a movie that requires full attention. It is not the typical fast food Hollywood garbage that requires no thought because lots of things go boom and make loud explosions! There is a time and a place for movies with loud explosions and lots of special effects but not when they are used to cover up a bad film, as they do with so many science fiction movies. This is the thinking man's science fiction. It's beautifully acted, well written, and very thought provoking. I remember the first time I saw it, I just sat on the couch when it was over, turned off the tv and did nothing but ruminate over what I had just seen. Very, very rare a movie does that to me.<br /><br />While a plot consisting of a man who uses time travel to change the past sounds extremely basic, it's all in the execution. This time travel based movie is done extremely well. I have shared this movie with a few friends over the years and most did not like it. But admittedly most of them have short attention spans and don't like to think when they see a movie, they would rather see the "things go boom" type of movie. Thus the title for my review. I really don't think there is any in between with The Jacket, I think either you will get it and love it, or it will make no sense to you and you'll hate it. Serious, if you have a short attention span, like a fast paced movie with lots of special effects, limited dialog, and maybe even some gratuitous nudity thrown in for good measure, stay far away from the Jacket.<br /><br />I also want to add the music is beautiful and haunting, a perfect compliment to the film and composed by the great Brian Eno.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sorry to all Pitt and Jolie fans, but  a big  'yawn'..............."></head><body><p>Except for a few cute moments here and there, this was a rather poorly done action flick. I went into this with high hopes, although not a huge Brad Pitt fan, I knew the man had delivered previously, and Angelina Jolie, even with her few flops, can be a good actress, and let's face it, this chick is smokin' hot!!! But as usual with myself getting "jiggy" for a movie, I was again let down, you'd think I'd be used to this by now. But, anyway, Let's begin with Mr. Pitt, shall we? Obviously one of Hollywood's golden boys, this man has made some huge hits, and this was one of them, and he is, um, OK in this, not great, but OK. I felt that during the comedic moments in this film he was really good, he can make you laugh pretty easily and has a gift for physical comedy, but when the serious, emotional scenes play out, I found him boring and lacking. Don't worry ladies, you get to see the world famous abs and pecs, I'm a strong enough man to be able to say this guy is hot and it'e easy to see why the ladies like him.<br /><br />Now for Angelina Jolie, wow does this woman look hot in a bra, which, among other lingerie items, she seems to be in alot of during this 123-minute movie. She too has a knack for some funny moments, and her chemistry with Pitt is decent, not memorable, but decent. Let's face it, Jolie has not done a decent acting job since Gia or Original Sin, and 'Smith" is no exception, she looks  sexy as hell, but that's about all I can give her, sorry.<br /><br />Now my biggest complaint, Vince Vaughn. One of the funniest men In Hollywood, with huge hits recently like Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers, you'd think he might have a chance in saving this. Nope, didn't happen, the man can't be funny and charming if he isn't given good material to work with, and except for one funny scene when he is yelling at his mother while carrying a rather big gun in his hands, the jokes here feel forced and really don't work.<br /><br />There are a couple of above-average action scenes, but way too many shoot-outs, most of them shot very choppy, scenes moving so quickly, I was wishing they would just slow down, you know, take your time in your killing, put on a show and all....<br /><br />I'm guessing alot of people are going to disagree with my review, In talking to some of my customers at work, alot of them were excited about this, raving on how the action really worked and Pitt and Jolie were excellent together, and that's fine. I guess I just want a little more with my action films these days, maybe a little more Sin City and Punisher and alot less Sahara and XXX2<br /><br />acting.........2.5 stars, Pitt and Jolie LOOK great, Vaughn bites<br /><br />directing.......2 stars, Poorly done, little more editing OK?<br /><br />special effects.....3 stars, Stunts are pretty cool, but gun play is well over-done<br /><br />action rating......2.5 stars, Some cool action...here and there<br /><br />quality........2.5 stars, Felt like an MTV video at times<br /><br />action</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="cool new hero for today's *urban* youth market and cgi effects!"></head><body><p>I can imagine the the meetings... Did you know Hollywood producers and scum use the term "urban market" to avoid being called racist. Anyway I wasn't there when they were planing to make this movie but I know what what market they were gunning for.<br />A relative told me it reminded him of "Dune" which I scoffed at because I love David Lynch's "Dune" because<br />A) I'm a David Lynch fan and<br />B) Also I did NOT read Frank Herbert's famous book which maybe would have spoiled the movie if I were to demand it be a faithful adaptation.<br /><br />ANYways, what he meant was that Chronicles of Riddick had aesthetic similarities with Dune, which is to *some* extent partially true, but Riddick is a cgi movie and so doesn't look the same.<br />I prefer sorta fake models to sort of fake digital ships. I don't quite get how people look at cgi and think it looks real.<br />I suppose it is a very willful suspension of disbelief. Give it a few years and all these cgi movies will look fake and terrible and people will laugh at them.<br /><br />The plot is messy, the dialog not too bright. The acting campy. But it is a fun ride. I admit it grew on me. Saw some on TV and it doesn't stink as much as I first thought. It looked as if a boardroom in Hollywood had come to the conclusion they need a more urban, "hip" hero for today's youth market or something. Like the scene with the pitbull alien beast. Riddick is *bad* yo! "Ahhh hell, ya done messed up now son, Riddick gonna get ya!" I'm getting old.<br />2.5 stars.</p></body></html>

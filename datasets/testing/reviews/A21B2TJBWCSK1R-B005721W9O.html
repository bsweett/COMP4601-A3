<meta name="summary" content="Deluxe Edition Contains Extras Worth the Double Dip!"></head><body><p>When Galaxy Quest was released in 2000, it was a modest success but it certainly didn't light the world on fire. Over the years, it has quietly amassed something of a cult following who delight in the film's affectionately satirical jabs at the Star Trek franchise and its fans, specifically the first incarnation with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. With this new Deluxe Edition DVD, it is about time for Galaxy Quest to be revisited and re-evaluated.<br /><br />"Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest" is a retrospective making of featurette that has key cast and crew members reminiscing about the experience of working on the film. They take us through its origins and we see how the original concept was quite different but was tweaked over time. In a nice touch, the main cast members return and tell all kinds of filming anecdotes, clearly looking back at this project with genuine affection.<br /><br />"Never Give Up, Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector" takes a look at the cast of Galaxy Quest and they talk about how they approached their respective roles. The filmmakers talk about why they cast the actors that are in the film and everyone dishes more wonderful stories.<br /><br />"By Grabthar's Hammer, What Amazing Effects" takes a look at the film's snazzy visual effects. They had Stan Winston do the aliens while ILM do the special effects. Winston speaks about his creations in archival footage.<br /><br />"Alien School: Creating the Thermian Race" examines the alien race that enlists the help of the Galaxy Quest crew. Actor Enrico Colantoni talks about how he came up with his character's voice.<br /><br />"Actors in Space" takes a look at how the cast made fun of their profession and their character archetypes.<br /><br />"Sigourney Weaver Raps" features a taped message that she made for her agent's birthday where the veteran actress raps with help from her fellow castmates.<br /><br />Also included are eight deleted scenes that feature more with Fred Kwan as he tours the ship's engineering section with his Zen-like calmness. There is a scene where the cast are shown their quarters based on their characters' personalities from the show. And we also get more of them bickering among each other on the alien planet.<br /><br />"Thermian Audio Track" allows you to watch the entire film dubbed in the alien language, which is actually pretty funny but I don't know if you would ever watch it more than once.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Be Careful What You Wish For"></head><body><p>In a wrecked economy at least one industry seems to be thriving:  the sacking folks industry.  In this interesting field of endeavor we find spineless, litigious-leery employers turning to third-party entities to perform the firings for them.  Thus we have the bizarre premise of an excellent film, UP IN THE AIR, the adventures of corporate head chopper Ryan Bingham (an aloof George Clooney) as he travels the U.S., suavely and swiftly terminating workers--all while rapidly approaching the coveted Ten Million Mile Membership.  Accordingly, Ryan is barely home 40 nights a year. . .until his superior (Jason Bateman is priceless) calls him back to corporate headquarters, as the technology is now in place to fire via streaming live video.  Alas, Ryan is grounded.<br /><br />Or so we thought.  The inspiration for the web cam terminations, young, gung-ho Natalie (Anna Kendrick), needs valuable experience in the field, so Ryan takes her under his wing and off they go to the airport, where Ryan tutors his protege on the fine art of streamlining travel.  And as they go, from city to city, Ryan hooks up with his female alter ego, Alex (a sizzling Vera Farmiga), while Natalie discovers she's just not cut out for the stark brutality of shattering a human being's life.  These interactions of the various characters furnish the charm of this film; they're not only infinitely interesting--they're very, very believable.  There are several termination scenes, some of them humorous, some of them disturbing, all of them compelling.<br /><br />Yet the beauty of UP IN THE AIR is its delicious irony.  Ryan, so proud of his fierce independence and reliance on nothing but a departure board, finds himself falling in love.  Yet the emptiness of his life resonates when Alex can't return the love (she has a family of her own); thus Ryan, on the side a motivational speaker, no longer believes the nonsense he preaches (jettison all the burdens of your life); he realizes he's trapped in the life he so meticulously created.  (As the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for.)  Accordingly there is an element of angst as UP IN THE AIR concludes, yet aren't there aspects of life much the same?  Besides, Clooney, Farmiga, Bateman, Kendrick, and the rest of a very diverse, ensemble cast make for some very spirited movie watching.  Wrecked economy or no.<br />--D.

But if you like a good disaster film, TWISTER delivers.  Director Jan DeBont(Speed) keeps the action sequences tense and volatile, but the film bogs down when it tries to focus on the failed relationship of stars Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.  Throw in Jamie Gertz and Cary Elwes in derivative roles as Paxton's new fiancee and his self-absorbed competitor, and you have the ingredients for standard disaster cum personal crises film.  But who can argue with the awesome dynamics of the terrifying twisters; the flying cows; the eighteen wheeler oil tanker, and other SEs which permeate and validify this blockbusting movie, which has the honor of being the first movie released on DVD.</p></body></html>

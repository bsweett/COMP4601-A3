<meta name="summary" content="Birth of new film franchise never misses a step - fantastic adaptation"></head><body><p>Forgive me for not being familiar with the comic book "Ironman" - I've only put a toe in the graphic novel pool and I've flat-out missed this one.<br /><br />So perhaps my rave review of this comic book adaptation is somewhat uninformed.  But given the fact that the filmmakers went for a PG-13 blockbuster approach, it's hard to imagine how director Jon Favreau (no, not President Obama's speechwriter, but the guy from "Swingers" and "Elf") could have given us a more polished, pitch-perfect movie.<br /><br />Start with a clever and detailed "birth of Ironman" story, a pretty funny script, and a wonderful ensemble of top-notch actors, and you've got a great cocktail.  As has been widely commented, the movie starts and stops with Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance as genius weapon-designer Tony Stark.  Poking gentle fun at Downey's sordid past, "Ironman" provides a fresh perspective on the superhero - Stark is one cool dude.<br /><br />Surrounding him are Gwyneth Paltrow as secretary/love interest Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as sidekick and straight man Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges as the bombastic Obadiah Stane (the name should give you some clues).  These gifted actors breathe life into characters that not only shine in the big scenes but also in the quiet, more mundane moments in the movie.<br /><br />I won't bother recapping the plot - it's pretty by-the-numbers fare - but strongly recommend enjoying this movie for its attention to detail.  Virtually every scene has something to recommend it, which isn't always the case with comic book adaptations because there's often so much darn exposition and backstory.  The first half of the movie shows the birth of Ironman in perhaps the most entertaining form of all - a birth of necessity.  You're so captivated by the character of Stark that you find yourself ignoring the top-notch special effects and how the movie - for all its violence - stays safely on the PG side without descending into "Phantom Menace" cartoonishness.<br /><br />An excellent film that has given birth to a new franchising juggernaut ("Ironman 2" and "Ironman 3" are already in pre-production), "Ironman" is a guilt pleasure without the guilt.</p></body></html>

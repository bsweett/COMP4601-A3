Clarice attempts to gain a better insight into the twisted mind of the killer by talking to another psychopath Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who used to be a respected psychiatrist. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) believes that Lecter who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator have the answers to their questions to help locate the killer. Clarice must first try and gain Lecter's confidence before he is to give away any information.<p>The Silence of the Lambs is a clever, chilling and brain-numbing movie which just keeps getting better and better. The performances are quite simply superb, the two leads, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both pull off uniquely amazing performances, and they have a great screen chemistry, while Scott Glenn and Ted Levine back them up nicely. Director Jonathan Demme pieces everything together awesomely with Ted Tally's extraordinary script, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel. On the subject of books and novels, this is one of the few films that has surpassed the high standards of its book, and The Silence of the Lambs deserved to be praised for that alone!<p>The Silence of the Lambs is a brilliant, immediate classic that everyone should've seen after 10 years of stunning the world.</p></body></html>

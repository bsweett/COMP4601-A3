However the human race misunderstands them and kind of treats them unfairly, so a powerful good mutant named Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) have formed a school for the gift where young mutants can control their powers and help the benifit of all mankind. However there are some terrorist mutants lead by Magneto (Ian McKellen) who are hellbent on trying to destroy the human race so that mutants can rule over mankind, a runaway mutant girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) who has the power to absorb lifeforces and energy from other beings including mutants temporarily of course as she runs away from home. She meets up with a Canadian mutant named Wolverine (a.k.a. Logan) (Huge Jackman) but after being attacked by a savage brute named Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) they get rescued by a team of mutants named The X-Men lead by Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) where they live in Professor X's school for the gifted to help mankind from the bad mutants such as Magneto's minions like Toad (Ray Park) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijin Stamos) who are planning on mutating the whole human race.<br /><br />An excellent adaptation of the popular comic books from Marvel that started a different trend on superheroes created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Bryan Singer who did the excellent "Usual Suspects" was born to do these movies except for the third as he really took the comics metaphor on discrimination of different people well to the big screen after years of development hell even with Carolco originally wanting the rights but Fox came to save it. The acting is quite excellent including the action sequences as i love how this Sci-fi movie plays as a movie about racism in the future and how to try to be accepted by mankind. I love how this movie introduces audiences to a different cinematic superhero then Batman or Superman back in 2000 who is Wolverine making him the best superhero ever! it was followed by an equally awesome yet even better sequel.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set offers the movie in a glorious picture and sound quality experience that would rocket the viewer to the roof. The extras are fantastic like audio commentary, behind the scenes footage, Deleted and Extended Scenes with optional commentary, Mutant Watch featurette that appeared on FOX TV, Charlie Rose interview with Bryan Singer, Still galleries, animatics, Intro by Bryan Singer, Five-part interactive documentary, Trailers, TV spots and internet interstitials.</p></body></html>

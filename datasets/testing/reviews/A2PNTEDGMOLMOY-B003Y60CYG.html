<meta name="summary" content="Elegy for the variety show"></head><body><p>Many more people are fans of Garrison Keillor's NPR radio hit, "A Prairie Home Companion" than who can describe it succinctly.  "PHC" is a show from a bygone era, where talented writers, comedians, and musicians put on a completely original two-hour show each week.  Sure, there are some stock characters and common refrains, and the subject matter may be dated (old timey music features prominently, and the show is set in low-tech, changeless Minnesota), but each show is completely unique within those parameters.  All in all, "PHC" is a time capsule showing what was good, decent, and just a wee bit naughty in Americana.<br /><br />Robert Altman's movie, "A Prairie Home Companion," is an elegy for that beloved TV show.  In a rather unbelievable set-up, a nasty Texas corporation (of course) has bought the beloved Fitzgerald Theater in downtown St. Paul and will tear down the lovely place to put up a parking lot.  And so this show that has been a home for its fans and its cast for over 30 years must say goodbye.  Altman then films the last episode, cutting away to the priceless behind-the-scenes moments when you see how these performers are a true family, and everyone's natural reaction is that "PHC" is a national treasure to be saved.  Anyone who wants to tear down this beloved institution needs a comeuppance.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor plays himself, as "GK," and he is ably assisted by a world-class cast of Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Klein, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, and many others.  Fans of the real-life show may be a bit surprised that Keillor's regular "PHC" cast doesn't get much time to shine, but that's the way of things.  Streep and Tomlin nearly steal the show as the singing Johnson sisters - who knew they could carry these tunes?  Reilly and Harrelson are excellent personifications of Keillor's recurring cowboy characters, Lefty and Dusty, and their litany of bad jokes near the end of the show is priceless.<br /><br />Kevin Klein is a bit fuzzy as Guy Noir, Private Eye.  He's more buffoonish than his character on "PHC," but Klein pulls it off.  When describing the Dangerous Woman (Virginia Madsen, an angel), Noir waxes poetic, "She wore a Mt. Rushmore T-shirt, and those old guys never looked so good."  And Tommy Lee Jones represents the dastardly investors who want to destroy the show.<br /><br />Shot in luscious tones and with all of Altman's visual artistry, "PHC" is quite simply a beautiful film. Slow and stately, to be sure, with many ruminations on passing and death, it is not always a bright and cheerful movie.  But it is a loving one, and it is fitting that this was Altman's last film - he uses "PHC" to remind us to not spend too much time looking back or looking ahea, because there are some pretty darn good things with us in the present.</p></body></html>

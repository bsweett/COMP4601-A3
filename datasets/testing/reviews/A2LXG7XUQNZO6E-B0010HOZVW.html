Check. Hmm, this sounds like a winner, doesn't it? Well, believe it or not...it is. The Brave One is a believable and effective revenge thriller that's highly reminiscent of 1974's Death Wish. In my opinion, Death Wish is a classic and Bronson is the man's man to end all man's men but Jodie Foster acts circles around Bronson and, let's be honest, is far better looking. Does that mean this is a better film? I wouldn't say its better but it's a darn good film nonetheless.<br /><br />The Brave One kicked tail, it really did. It wasn't amazing but I let out some audible gasps while watching this as well as a "Holy Crap!" once or twice and that spells entertainment in my book. It's never going to be a classic or anything but nu-sploitation films like this and Death Sentence have really put a smile on my face. If you haven't seen The Brave One, do so. Foster may walk soft (and occasionally manly) but she carries a very lethal stick.</p></body></html>

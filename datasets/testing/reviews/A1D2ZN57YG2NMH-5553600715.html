<meta name="summary" content="Chilling... Yet Not Too Chilling"></head><body><p>This is about the perfect thriller film for me, scary, but not scary enough to keep you awake the rest of your natural life, (although I'll admit, watching this before bed wasn't the best idea I've ever had.) Anyways, basically this film comprises elements of "The Sixth Sense" "Secret Window" "The Village" and some really good mystery film, and adds an eerily supernatural touch. In my opion, this film contained one of the 5 most chilling scenes I've ever seen, and no, I won't spoil it, (just beware of old people in communion gowns.) lol<br /><br />In the end, this is a very worthwhile thriller, and I reccomend it.</p></body></html>

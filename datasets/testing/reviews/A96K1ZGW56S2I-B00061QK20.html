<meta name="summary" content="Not the Best of Movies, But an Extraordinary Piece of Art."></head><body><p>HERO was originally released in Asia in 2002 under the title YING XIONG.  The film stars Jet Li as a fighter and local lawman known as Nameless. The movie takes place in ancient times when the country of China did not yet exist and was simply a broken nation of seven different kingdoms. The King of Qin is a wise and mighty ruler and is determined to unite the warring kingdoms into one country. Nameless is sent to the King after it is known that he has killed three assassins, two men and one woman, who have tried to murder the King before. Nameless tells his story and a battle of wits ensues as the story is revised several times.<br /><br />There is some pretty darn cool sword fighting that takes place in HERO and the visual imagery is stunningly beautiful. The plot device of retelling the story several times makes the film more interesting than if it was a simple straitforward tale and the slow character development of Nameless and King that builds before our eyes augments the other positive aspects of the movie.<br /><br />However, HERO is a movie and simply as a movie, it's not as good as it could have been.  For example, some of the action sequences are drawn out way too long and come off as being cheesy (many in the theatre I attended laughed at some of the most serious battle sequences in the film). Also, because the story is retold several times, viewers can easily become confused and disinterested.  As a work of art though, HERO is magnificent and is worth watching just to admire its beauty.  Appreciate it for what it is and nothing more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tales from the not so deep"></head><body><p>This one is not the instant classic that the first and (especially) the second, but it holds up well enough as a good action movie. It is not as intense as the first. Nor is it as insightful as the second. The aim this time around is simply to have fun, and it meets that goal very well.<br /><br />Arnold is back here in his likely last appearance as a terminator from the future, and, despite the years that have passed since the first outing, he looks very much the same, as he should. Kristanna Loken is a welcome addition to the pantheon of terminator models, becoming both very sensual and very eerie.<br /><br />You may feel that the movie should have done more to deal with the concepts of fate and free will, like was discussed in the previous movie, but if you merely want to watch a movie that has great effects, great action and passably charismatic characters, you could do worse than this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mirren, yes...but a word about Michael Sheen's great TB"></head><body><p>Helen Mirren is getting the requisite kudos for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth.  But there's another portrayal in Stephen Frears' excellent film of an equally public figure that is going relatively overlooked: Michael Sheen's spot-on take on Tony Blair.  I was totally mesmerized at just how perfectly Sheen had both the look and feel of the unbridled optimism of TB at the outset of his first term.  That's key because it's Blair's intuition on  the matters at hand here that are instrumental in shaking the Royal Family out of their tone-deaf dismissal of the unfolding events across the country.<br /><br />It's interesting to see the portrayals here and see how harsh or sympathetic they are (Mirren's Elizabeth is complex and beyond analysis here):<br /><br />Prince Philip - A devastating take on him<br /><br />Price Charles - Painted very sympathetically by Alex Jennings, but obviously cowed by his mother<br /><br />Alastair Campbell - A very positive take on New Labour's wordsmith by Mark Bazeley (I'm a big Campbell fan, so it was good to see the script honor his contributions to Blair's early successes).<br /><br />Queen Mom - Yikes!  Not a very pretty picture<br /><br />Frears' delicate and respectful approach keeps William and Harry just off the picture.<br /><br />What will really take you about the movie is this: as many reviewers here note, they found themselves strangely moved and shocked by Diana's death, like she was a member of the family.  When those scenes play out here, wow, you'll be quite surprised at the emotions that well up in you.  It will happen.  Trust me.<br /><br />Frears - as pitch-perfect movie helmsman - includes the stirring end portion of the eulogy penned and intoned by Charles, Earl of Spencer (Diana's brother).  Spencer's speech is generally regarded as one of the finest eulogies ever rendered.  It has become a part of British textbooks.  Here's the part you hear in the movie:<br /><br />"I would like to end by thanking God for the small mercies he has shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant and when she had joy in her private life. Above all we give thanks for the life of a woman I am so proud to be able to call my sister, the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be extinguished from our minds."<br /><br />That will send a chill up your spine when you see it in the theater.</p></body></html>

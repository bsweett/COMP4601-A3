<meta name="summary" content="Terribly disappointing..."></head><body><p>I can't say I wasn't warned. I had been dying to see Fantastic Four for quite some time. Despite warnings from my boyfriend and my brother that this movie was a huge letdown, I had to watch it and decide for myself. On the one hand, if I'd listened to them, I'd have watched one less bad movie. But on the other hand, if not, my best friend and I wouldn't have laughed at it's complete stupidity (hence why I give it 2 stars for at least it gave us something to make fun of). It truly was one of the biggest disappointments for me in a while. Sad, because it really looked so good in the previews. If you want to see it, I'd advise renting first and then if you like it (for what reason I can't imagine) go buy it. A big BOO from me!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I know a taxidermist"></head><body><p>that's going to have a heart attack when he sees what I brung him!&quot; So says Quint near the climax of Jaws, the first summer blockbuster and one of the greatest,  most exciting movies ever made.  Face it, few other  movies can match the intensity of the narrative, or the credibility of the  characters.  The shark, when it is finally seen, looks rather fake, but the  characters seem real and that is what sells this movie and makes it surpass  the likes of Armageddon. The scene where Brody (played by Roy Scheider) is  being mimicked at the dinner table by his youngest son, the scene where his  wife calms him down about yelling at his older son to get out of a boat,  only to change her mind after looking at a picture in a book Brody was  reading, the scene where 2 fishermen hook a roast &amp; throw it off a dock  to get more than they bargained for, all are strong examples of the  verissimiltude that this movie carries with it.<p>But along with the  characters this movie also boasts scientific accuracy, at least as much as  will be permitted to let the plot function.  Territoriality, for example,  is a theory that has been applied to sharks, but there has also been  evidence to suggest that it is inaccurate.  In general, sharks do not  develop a taste for human flesh.  However, the anecdotes of the shark  experts ring true, &amp; provides insights of their different  personalities--Hooper chuckling over how a shark ripped apart his first  boat &amp; how it fascinated him vs. Quint's chilling narrative of The  Indianapolis.  <p>The picture has never been clearer than on this dvd (I  keep odd hours &amp; have roommates, so I must keep the volume down &amp;  therefore will not rate the audio quality)  The documentary is likewise  terrific &amp; makes up for the lack of audio commentary.  Some of the  deleted scenes were used in network broadcasts of the movie, others look  like alternate takes of scenes.  All in all, the only thing I found mildly  disapointing about this movie were the bloopers.  We only get 2.<p>But  still, it's Jaws, the most exciting movie released this year (excepting  North-by-Northwest) whether it be the movie theater or video. And a  quintessential popcorn muncher.  See it before you go into the water.</p></body></html>

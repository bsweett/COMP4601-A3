<meta name="summary" content="GRIM LOOK INTO THE FUTURE"></head><body><p>V FOR VENDETTA is a superbly orchestrated and well made movie, with evidence of its MATRIX lineage highly evident in the stylized feel of the movie.  Hugo Weaving does a remarkably good job considering we never see the actors face, so with his Guy Fawlkes mask always on, his character has to be accessed with his voice more than anything, and Weaving is amazing in conveying V's mission and feelings.  Natalie Portman is equally impressive as Evey, the girl he rescues from police and hides her away in his hideaway.  Their relationship develops interestingly and convincingly.  Stephen Rea as the determined Police Inspector does some of his best work since THE CRYING GAME, and John Hurt who plays the tyrannical Chancellor rises to the occasion.  The film's message is pertinent to a society where the government certainly squelches individualism and creativity, nnd the direction and camera work are brilliant.  It isn't a pleasant picture the movie paints, but it is certainly well done and worth seeing.</p></body></html>

Part of it is that a lot of times the films come across as slightly pretentious; as if the film is genuinely a classic right out of the gate and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know movies or hasn't seen it enough to fully appreciate it. However, I will admit the guy does have filmmaking talent and screenplay-wise, he writes very sharply and even in complex matters and with his latest, you can see that there is a solid filmmaker underneath here and indeed many were calling the film the best of 2007, but after 3 viewings, I still think there's promise but not a fully realized film here.<br /><br />The film takes place in the late 19th/20th century where self-made oilman Daniel Plainview has been going from place to place making promises and drilling in the ground for lucrative and money-making oil deposits. With his adoptive son, H.W., Daniel is quite ambitious and committed to his successes and amassing of wealth so when Paul Sunday of the town of Little Boston arrives with talks of an untapped oil deposit, Daniel and his son head down there only to find a problem in Eli Sunday, Paul's brother, who can sell and promote his church just as well as Daniel's love for oil and money.<br /><br />I recently saw Magnolia again, which was a film on first viewing I didn't really care for, but deciding to revisit it, I thought I'd at least give it another shot and while it still had its problems, I liked it slightly more. The same thing happened with this film where its pacing and length problems weren't as glaring and it's lack of a compelling narrative wasn't as troublesome. Ultimately, the film is more a character study than anything as we see a character get more demanding, oppressive and quite foregone. The comparisons to "Citizen Kane" are well founded and while the film did keep me interesting, there were other times where I felt it wasn't as compelling as it should've been.<br /><br />Every year there tends to be one of those performances where it's kind of obvious they're going to win so it was without shock that Daniel Day-Lewis won, who's utterly convincing and explosive who's quite comfortable slipping into his darker half. We have Paul Dano who holds his own despite the age difference (although his choking cat impression during a sermon is unintentionally funny, as well as Day-Lewis' "drainage!" line). Aside from H.W., and a role by Kevin J. O'Connor who's best known for comedic roles in "the Mummy" and "Deep Rising", everyone is kind of set dressing.<br /><br />Where the film stumbles a bit is in its score. Nothing wrong with it and some scenes work quite well but there's one sound, an irritating crescendo dissonance that opens the film and re-appears, is grating and in other scenes it doesn't quite match up. Then there's the ending scene which takes place in, of all places, a bowling alley, with unintentionally funny parts and a weird use of the word "milkshake". A subplot is needed for story and character but it still extends its length to dragging levels. But then its near-wordless opening sequence, a spectacular setpiece involving a derrick fire and Day-Lewis' performance keep you interested.<br /><br />Its less-than-stellar assortments of goodies aside, There Will Be Blood is indeed a worthy watch, however, I'm not going to call it an outright masterpiece because everyone says it is.</p></body></html>

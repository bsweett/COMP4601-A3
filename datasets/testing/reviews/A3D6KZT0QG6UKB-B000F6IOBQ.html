<meta name="summary" content="Great movie for what it is."></head><body><p>Well, if you want to see a movie with compelling characters, intricate plotlines that make sense, and big issues that make you think and uphold your political beliefs about the senseless of violence or world politics, chances are that you are avoiding this movie and seeing Munich or The Squid and the Whale (however, I'll take a B-movie over a preachy A-movie any day). If you want special effects, camera work and Kate Beckinsale in a leather-vinyl cat suit, read on.<br /><br />This movie is a confused mess, made barely comprehensible by the beginning refresher course from the first movie. I barely kept up due to a rerun of the original movie on TNT the week before and even that wasn't completely helpful. Basically a vampire (Kate Beckinsale) and a werewolf-vampire hybrid (Scott Speedman) run around Russia or Eastern Europe getting chased by Marcus, the old vampire waking up at the end of the last movie, in some convoluted attempt to either avenge the coven or find his REALLY BAD werewolf brother. Apparently the 13th century werewolves were just nasty beasts and not the club going ravers of the first movie (and may I just add that the elimination of the Goth Vampires sipping absinthe and the Raver Werewolves hanging out in sewers flexing their hard abs is a definite plus.)<br /><br />Derek Jacobi centers the movie as the head of a secret society that seems to like blowing things up and stealing bodies. He's got an agenda but it's silly (and the source of a big gaping plothole).<br /><br />Still, what distinguishes this movie from your average Michael Bay shoot-em-up? Well there's some attempt at plotting (confused and jumbled yes, but more than guy must run away from evil conspiracy) and the camera work is amazing. The special effects are great and Kate Beckinsale can sell the lines. Not everyone likes her because she's been in some crap movies (Pearl Harbor's only contribution to cinema is a song in Team America) but she's also been in some good ones (Cold COmfort Farm is great) but she is more than a woman with a great body in a leather vinyl cat suit.<br /><br />Although the leather vinyl catsuit doesn't hurt her case.</p></body></html>

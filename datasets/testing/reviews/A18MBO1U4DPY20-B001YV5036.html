DIRECTION<br />I havent been following Ron Howard's filmography but Cinderella Man is one film that catches you just when you're least expecting. Every scene in the film has a certain bit of life that leads to the climax of the film. I don't know what this man was thinking considering I never heard of Braddock before this movie. I don't think every director would dare to mingle with a story like Cinderella Man especially since it's so difficult to recreate the past and instill in the actors and their eyes the feeling of utter life induced irony. The Camerawork is astonishing most of the times and the language of the film has the kind of subtlety that classics do. This is the kind of film that brings out the yearn in me to aspire to become a film-maker<br /><br />2. THOMAS NEWMAN's Timeless Score<br />I used to think there is no man in the world that can make a score that can add to a film's divinity and sanctity like Thomas Newman can. After watching Cinderella Man, I have nothing but absolute respect for his ability to bring out melodies that recreate a time several decades back. I would actually go as far as saying that the score of Cinderella Man outdoes his previous work(Road To Perdition) The ambient instrumenal music adds to the impact the snow creates. It's ideal winter music.<br /><br />3.CASTING<br />I notice that throughout the length of the film there was a major spot missing. There is no firm spot for Supporting Actor. You'd think Russel Crowe would have someone to take care of his back but besides his half absent manager there is noone in the film that really sympathises with him. I found this queer,strange and very interesting. Russel Crowe alone carries this epic with very mature flawless performances by Renee Zewellger and the kids. 10/10 for casting really. If I could use one word for the music of this film, I'd say "UNBELEIVABLE"<br /><br />4. IMPACT<br />Although I never wept during this film, it arose a very staunch emotion and some scenes made me skip a few heartbeats. RAGING BULL was a film that I liked but it was flawed owing to overdramatic and conscious ending.Cinderella Man is confident,disquieting and unbelievable at times. Those scenes where Russel Crowe smiles at the punches being delivered to him,the scene where Renee Zewellger throws wine on his husbands opponent's face and the scene when his young son steals ham from the butcher and later cries in his father's arms were simply disquieting.<br /><br />5.CAMERAWORK<br />For this, you'll simply have to watch the film cause my comprehension fails me here.<br /><br />Now, I think that pretty much sums up this film. I only wish I had scene it in the theater though. What is also strange is how I never really respected Russel Crowe. I know he's an excellent actor but in Cinderella Man, I truly think I came over my juvenile dislike for him. He is as complete an actor as they come.<br /><br />Films I think you should watch if you liked Cinderella Man include,ROAD TO PERDITION and THE BASKETBALL DIARIES.</p></body></html>

You know where it's going from the get-go, and it gets there by the most predicatble path. The attraction between Toula and Ian is never explained; he's just a plug-in &quot;dream guy&quot; who falls into her life.  In fact, his role is so trivial that John Corbett isn't even listed in the 15 &quot;top billed&quot; cast members in the IMDB description of the movie! <p>Toula's large, boisterous family is likable enough, but there are so many of them that nobody is really well developed as a character.  Anyone who grew up in a large ethnic-American family (Greek, Italian, Polish, or whatever) -- or dated/married someone from such a family --will probably enjoy it. So will women over 30 who have been less than lucky in love. If you're not in either of those categories, you'll probably find yourself fidgeting as the movie wears on.</p></body></html>

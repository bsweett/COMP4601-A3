<meta name="summary" content="Oh so pretty and faithful, but may alienate the masses"></head><body><p>Director Zack Snyder deserves a lot of credit for sticking as close to the graphic novel as possible, yet changing just enough to not totally alienate someone who has never heard of or read the source material before taking the venture to the local theater.<br /><br />The visuals are a thing of beauty. The grimy city looks and feels like a living organism. The CGI world and other various visual effects throughout the entire movie are well done, never forcing you out of this alternate 1985. By the way, this flick holds nothing back in the blood and guts department either. Not quite Sin City level, but darn close.<br /><br />The cast is hit and miss. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach is by far the best fit of any character in the film. He is just amazing with and without the ever changing inkblot mask. I read rumors that he might play Freddy Krueger in The Nightmare of Elm Street remake. I would have said "no way" before, but now I'm convinced that he would be the best replacement for Robert Englund (though I don't think the original needs to be remade). Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, who is best known to me as the father of the two Winchester boys on the TV show Supernatural, is also outstanding even though he has limited screen time. Billy Crudup's soft and monotone voice actually fit the powerful Dr. Manhattan nicely, seeming to add intelligence to every word. I know a lot of people think that Malin Akerman was miscast, but I quite enjoyed her and thought she brought the right amount of sexiness to Silk Spectre II.<br /><br />The Comedian's death, the inspired 7 minute or so title sequence and Dr. Manhattan's whole transformation story are the true hightlights, as well as, most of Rorschach's scenes.<br /><br />Now for the negatives. Patrick Wilson was just okay as the boring Nite Owl II, but I never cared much about the character to begin with. Matthew Goode as Ozymandias was the worst of the whole lot in my opinion. Not horrible by any means, but the weak link for sure. The soundtrack features some great classic rock songs, but other than Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A'Changin" over the titles, none really mesh well with what's on screen.  Also, the first 2/3 of the movie are really good, but the last 1/3 does drag and even left me wanting to revisit earlier moments.<br /><br />Overall, as a casual fan of the graphic novel, I found more to admire than dislike with Watchmen the movie. Those uninitiated into this world may be checking their watch often, but most fans should be happy with what Snyder managed to do with this "unfilmable" material.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A director's film; the Briony trio turn in a powerful, collective performance"></head><body><p>Amazon's review gets its right here: this is a director's film.  Joe Wright's staging of Dunkirk in one extended, long shot is magnificent; it's something that will stand as a testament to his ability for decades.<br /><br />Keira Knightley - still only 22 - and James McAvoy are solid as the star-crossed leads.  About Keira, enough said.  About McAvoy, he continues to grow into a major film star.  We happened across him the other night in a small part in the BBC's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5YP1Y">The Inspector Lynley Mysteries Series 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5</a>.  That was about 2001.  He's been on a fast-rising, well-deserved, upwards trajectory since then, most notably his fantastic turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)</a>, in which he doesn't get blown off the screen by Forest Whitaker's epic rendering of Idi Amin.  Holding his own there was an achievement in itself.<br /><br />Despite the two stars, the film hangs it hat on a triumvirate of actresses who play the role of Briony.  This is where I feel the MPAA got it wrong in its 2007 Supporting Actress nominations: Saoirse Ronan got the nod for her role as 13-year-old Briony.  Surely, she gets the meat of the time on-screen, and it's a very self-assured performance for 13-year-old girl.  But, acting-wise, both Romola Garai (as the 18-year-old version) and the power cameo by Vanessa Redgrave as 'Older Briony' (that's how the credits tab her) are better performances.  I was especially taken by Ms. Garai's short but powerful rendering.  It's the point in her life where Briony begins to comprehend what she's done and cannot un-do.  That experience is clearly etched on her face and her performance.</p></body></html>

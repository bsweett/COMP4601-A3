What makes this movie especially interesting to me is the sub texture of individual characters (especially those played by DeNiro and Stone) who seem to be torn between various addictions and the demands of those addictions on the heart and mind. I almost (not quite) feel sympathy for DeNiro's character ("Ace" Rothstein) who manifests all of the requisite skills of an effective CEO amidst all the corruption he accepts and thereby condones. He wants to be a loving, devoted husband and father. Except for his feelings for the character played by Stone (Ginger McKenna), he is the absolute realist. The life he offers to her is one which, from the moment he proposes marriage, she is reluctantly willing but ultimately unable to accept. The characters played by Pesci (Nicky Santoro) and Woods (Lester Diamond) are most representative of an underworld culture of crime and corruption, addiction, violence, greed, glamor, and self-interest. The first half of the movie is essentially a documentary on the casino world, crisply and (when necessary) brutally managed by those controlled by syndicate bosses headquartered elsewhere. The fictional narrative becomes dominant in the second half as the mob eventually loses its control and most of the characters lose their lives. Corruption exists at all levels of this world, varying only in terms of degree of access to the hundreds of millions of dollars processed each day. Meanwhile, conventioneers and tourists pour through the casinos, unaware of the human darkness concealed by the sparkling lights.</p></body></html>

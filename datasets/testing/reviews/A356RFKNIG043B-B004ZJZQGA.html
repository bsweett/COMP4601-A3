It's a rare delight, but I watch films for precisely these experiences, and In Bruges delivers the goods in spades. McDonagh's script cracked me up time and again with its dark, harsh humor constantly leavened by weirdly tender moments, and his beautiful direction brings Bruges to life in a very odd yet very wonder-full way.<br /><br />I love that city and have spent some very fine days wandering its cobbled streets and gazing in awe at endless gingerbread vistas out of the 12th and later centuries, and this film takes full advantage of it all. McDonagh had a flash of genius when he set this twisted little gangster tale there, as the contrast and emotional chiaroscuro of the plot dovetails perfectly with the elegant, ancient perfections of Bruges.<br /><br />But what makes this all come alive are the flawless performances of Gleeson and especially Farrell, who I think delivers one of the funniest turns I've seen on celluloid in many years. I laughed myself silly at some of his lines here. You definitely have to enjoy Irish humor and be able to decipher the thick brogues, but if you do and can you will be amply rewarded. There are some outrageously fresh bits, and when Fiennes shows up it all shifts into overdrive and can't be stopped.<br /><br />There is endless "bad" language, lots of f's and c's to go around, but that along with the occasional violence somehow seems perfectly apt and never gratuitous. This is both a comedy and a drama but somehow not a dramedy. Perhaps a comma? In any case (dative or what have you), In Bruges worked on every level for me, even the romance. Poesy is perfect with Farrell and their romance is strangely believable, mainly due to her almost slapstick gazes of love. And the deliciously ironic ending has to be seen to be semi-disbelieved.<br /><br />There was nothing that I didn't like about this film...only that it finally ended.<br /><br />Here's hoping for many more in this vein from the fertile mind and perfectly panoramic eye of Martin McDonagh.</p></body></html>

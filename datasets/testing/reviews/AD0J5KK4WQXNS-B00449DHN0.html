<meta name="summary" content="Bloody America"></head><body><p>Shamefully overlooked in the Oscars, no one really wants to acknowledge that America was devised on the back of mass genocide, gang wars, thieves, crooked politicians all coupled with heavy doses of bitter bloody racism. Gangs of New York is all about that and then some more.<p>The film starts with an almost primordial scene as the different warring factions of a place in New York known as the "five points" come together to sort out their discrepancies using clubs, knives, swords, hatchets and claws. Its the "Native American" versus the "Irishman" or the "Native American" versus whoever else sets foot on their land. Bill the Butcher (a massively impressive, larger than life, Uncle Sam from Hell type character played by Daniel Day Lewis), leader of the Natives, wins the initial battle for the five points and soon enough the numerous other failed gangs have had to resign under his power. The leader of the Irishman is killed during the battle and his only son escapes, vowing revenge.<p>16 years later the son (Leonardo DiCaprio) is back to avenge his father by joining the natives to murder Bill the Butcher as an insider. By this stage the five points is starting to look more like New York and there are plenty of set pieces along the way including the abolishment of slavery marches, warlords feuding, gangs causing trouble in various ways, fire brigades battling each other, corrupt politicians trying to win votes, P.T.Barnum and his shows and DiCaprio's love interest (Cameroon Diaz playing... Cameroon Diaz) caught between two and even more men.<p>Historically you will love it, however the film does fail in that the premise is pretty much just your average revenge story with a whole load of "other" factual historical stuff on the outside, but it moves along at a cracking good pace and the screen time is mostly devoted to Daniel Day Lewis (wise choice from Scorsese - DeNiro is hardly missed at all!), who is an absolute powerhouse and it is his character alone that makes this movie worth its weight it Gold. For all its misgivings the movie still screams past most other historical dramas. Sure it is a little light on plot, but come on - its like the antichrist just directed his version of "Titanic" on a really bad acid trip. It is thoroughly outrageous stuff indeed. What did you expect - Oliver Twist?</p></body></html>

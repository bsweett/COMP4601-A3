<meta name="summary" content="Zombie's First Film!!!"></head><body><p>I have owned this movie for the past 2 years, but I think today I actually watched it all the way through! I think Zombie did a really good job. I love how he puts incredible detail into, like the scary props at Captain Spaulding's and all the HALLOWEEN decorations were awesome. Four college students named Bill, Jerry, Mary, and Denise are traveling throughout America looking at different road-side attractions, until they come to Captain Spaulding's who tells them about Dr. Satan. They become interested and run into the sadistic Firefly family, who act friendly at first, but turn to psychopaths. On HALLOWEEN, they torture them by using a razor on Bill's face, cut through Jerry's scalp, dress Denise up like a little girl, Mary's dad gets shot and his face torn off, etc. (It would be sad if this happened in real life.) Later, Denise must survive Dr. Satan's underground chamber. The climax was a little silly, but it's horror film. If you love HALLOWEEN, Zombie's movies and his style, you'll love HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES!!!</p></body></html>

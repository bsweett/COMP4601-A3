He's pretty tortured by it, and once, before he knew his seeing was a gift, he attempted suicide, was dead for two wags of a dog's tail, and, well, even though he lived, he's destined for hell for merely attempting a mortal sin. He's also graced with the knowledge that he's destined for hell.  The archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) tells him so. That's a helluva thing.<br /><br /> So cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) walks into John's life. Her twin sister was a mental patient who climbed to the top of a skyscraper and swan dove. That being a mortal sin - now she's in hell. Angela wants to go in hell herself, and has to immerse herself in a tub of cold water to do so. "Whatever you do,"  John says, "don't close your eyes." Eventually it's John, the cop, and Gabriel vs. Satan (Peter Stormare) and the lead singer from Bush in a holy rumble.<br /><br />Modern comic books and the movies about them are a lot more obsessed with anti-heroes - think "Spawn," "Sin City," "Blade," and "Hellboy" -  than they are heroes, and "Constantine" is firmly in that category: Good may prevail, but it does so in a way that credits evil. The world's dark, sinful and malevolent, but there's guns, cigarettes, women who look like Rachel Weisz and a couple other vices, so we got a chance.</p></body></html>

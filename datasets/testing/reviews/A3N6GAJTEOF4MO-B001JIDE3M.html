What is it about the guy that has him reading a script and saying "yeah I wanna star in that movie"? Does he have some form of learning difficulty, or does he do it on purpose to test how far he can push his fans before they say "OK that's enough"? One thing's for sure, "Journey to the Centre of the Earth" is one of his worst films to date. Not only is it a terrible story featuring some terrible supporting actors, but a film that needs to take advantage of the best CGI technology in the world, seems to fall short on its budget... or their CGI guy hates the director, one or the other. The prospect of what lies in the centre of our Earth is an intriguing one, and has only really been touched upon in a good way by the movie "The Core", however, this just falls short of grabbing my interest. I'm aware this is based on the Jules Verne novel and in some ways could be considered a 21st century sequel, however, it pales in comparison to the fantasy of the original.<br /><br />The story focuses around scientist Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) and his quest to find his lost brother. On the way his nephew, Sean played by Josh Hutcherson (that annoying kid from Zathura), and his Mountain guide Hannah played by Anita Briem... I've never heard of her either stumble across the Centre of the Earth. That's right, I said stumble, because apparently you just stumble across a portal to the centre of our planet. I know it's a fantasy film, but come on, you can't seriously expect my kids to buy the fact that a scientist, his nephew and a mountain guid stumble across the centre of our planet. What about the mountain guide? She's a guide, for the mountains. Has she not seen this pathway before? Maybe she has and she just forgot it was there, let's be honest, it's an easy thing to forget about in the hectic day of a mountain guide. I can't tell you anymore about the story because it's just infuriating to think about it in anymore detail. Just know it involves dinosaurs, really big plants and jumping piranha's that can be hit with baseball bats.<br /><br />I'm aware it's a fantasy film and they aren't meant to ascertain to any form of genuine reality, but I just found this film and it's sequences to be utterly ridiculous. I'm actually disappointed by Fraser and although I've come to expect him in terrible films, this one just takes the cake and I'm sure that to many this will be the film that will have his fans saying "that's enough." I know I've come close to saying that this time around, but I'm prepared to give him one more chance. All I know is that with a virtually unknown supporting cast and quite frankly shoddy CGI effects, there's no doubting the terrible nature of this film.<br /><br />Stay away, because you really don't want to risk seeing such an atrocity.</p></body></html>

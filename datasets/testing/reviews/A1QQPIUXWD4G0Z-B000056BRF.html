""></head><body><p>The 1959 adaptation of Lew Wallace's famous novel is the pinnacle of filming achiement: rightfully winning 11 Academy Awards for, among other things, its spectacular sets, brilliant acting, great direction, and beautiful score.<br /><br />Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a respected merchant in Judea whose people are under the yoke of Roman rule.  He soon breaks ties with his life-long Roman friend Messala (Stephen Boyd)after his family and livelihood fall victim to Roman injustice.  Condemened as a traitor to serve in the galleys under the command of Quintus Arius (Jack Hawkins), Judah Ben Hur keeps faith in his Lord and vows revenge against Messala.  Our hero is soon taken to fight Macedonian pirates and to impress the crowds in Rome's Circus Maximus.  Finally free, he returns to Judea to exact his revenge.  His woes and hatred go unabatated until the Resurrection.<br /><br />The film's theme is similar to Job's story in The Old Testament.  A devout man's faith is tested by God's taking away of all that makes him human: his family, his wealth, his sense of self.  All that remains to test in him is his faith. God will not stop plaguing Judah with woes until he's convinced of his undying faith.  The story is epic and well adapted as a film with one of Miklos Rosza's most memorable musical scores.  Although the film is rather heavy handed with its evangelical theme (Jesus scenes with choir intruductions, divine miracles, the resurrection, salvation etc.) that's the theme of the book as intended by its author and is therefore unavoidable. Despite the often overpowering biblical theme: I find the the story to be a moving epic regardless.  My favorite part is when Quintus Arius descends in to the rowers' benches in the Roman Galleys and exclaims:<br /><br />"...that's good, hate keeps a man alive: it gives him strength!  Now listen to me all of you! You are all condemned men whose purpose is to serve this ship, should you fail you will sink with this ship chained to your oar: row well and live!"<br /><br />Although his muscular anglo-saxon build hardly met the physical requirements for the role, Charlton Heston's persona as Ben Hur brings a commanding figure and presence to the story.  His acting style is consistent with the other loin-cloth characters he played in other films before and after (i.e. Moses in 'The Ten Commandments' and Taylor in 'Planet of the Apes'.)  Jack Hawkins (Bridge on the River Kwai; Zulu) as Quintus Arius also brings a commanding presence with his theatrical background as the cynical consul.  Stephen Boyd as Messala plays one of the most memorable roles especially in the part where he affirms his hatred of Judah at the end of the chariot race: one of the most memorable performances in Hollywood history.  The worst performance in the film is without a doubt that of Haya Harareet as Esther: utterly unattractive and barely proficient in English, her vapid expressions and forced acting undermined the intensity of every scene she appeared in.  Being Palestinian,  the main reason for her casting in the role was most likely political instead of being based on any standard of competence: done so to demonstrate a spirit of cooperation between the Israeli government and Palestinian authorities at the time.<br /><br />This is truly one of the greatest films ever made.  Director William Wyler did an outstanding job with this staggering film production.  The 20+ minute chariot race was a real event and it's still to this day an unprecedented spectacle in film: it involved no CGIs or studio shots of an actor riding a fake chariot with a moving backdrop.  Even for those who, like myself, don't care much for the evangelical themes that mark this story, this film presents a moving epic on injustice and a man's spiritual triumphs for which one doesn't need to be a devout Christian to enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A big mess for Wes"></head><body><p>"The Darjeeling Limited" is a flop, a retread, a bore, and another sign that writer/director Wes Anderson can't press every character and story into his rigid template of cool detachment and visual irony. It's not even disappointing, really; you could see in Anderson's previous feature, "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou," this ambition to make just about any subject funnel into his bug jar of wondrous twigs, leaves and such. Never mind if it leaves the audience stuck in first gear, perpetually sizing up leery archetypes that seem stolen from that creepy brother Dan Futterman played in the TV show "Judging Amy."  The characters in this India-by-train travel narrative are so flat and inert they become models in Anderson's moving diorama. What in the world are you supposed to do with them?<br /><br />Yeah, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a masterpiece. Was then, still is, gets better with age, one of the seminal works of the era, yessir, all that. (Spare us the anointing oil on "Rushmore" and "Bottle Rocket.") And for that, to Wes, we say thanks. "Tenenbaums" is also six years old, a perfect marriage of subject and tone, and somewhere in Anderson's wheelhouse. The guy got a bit self-satisfied with "The Life Aquatic" - not a terrible movie (endearing, even colorful) but more or less something you'd dream up in your backyard sandbox - but "Darjeeling" smacks of a half-baked idea cut squarely off at the knees (Anderson can't even be troubled to keep the titular train around for the second and third acts) crossed with the director's trademark muted sentiment and one of those hairpin turns into tragedy he likes so much.<br /><br />Does "The Darjeeling Limited" have a point? Oh, sure. It's same one Anderson's been making for years: Familial reconciliation, tinged with the complexity and bittersweetness of human nature. This time it's three brothers, one of whom is recovering from a severe car accident, on a bonding trip through the land that stopped Alexander The Great cold. The train is appropriately quirky, although Anderson's camera never lingers for too long, and there is no cuter-than-thou introduction to it. Francis (Owen Wilson) has arranged the trip for Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Peter (Adrien Brody); he runs it on a supposedly tight itinerary he has printed out by his assistant, who stays in a different part of the train.<br /><br />Jack's the cad, and a writer. Peter's the softy, and Francis is the control freak, an annoying trait that is no less so when we discover its roots.  The elephant in the room is their father's death; we can only guess at the trauma, because all three brothers hail from the "Oh. Wow." factory of emotional output. This is, in fact, the Tenenbaum family poured into these fellows - like Richie crafted picture after picture of Margot, they glumly cling to their father's possessions, such as a 12-piece set of Louis Vuitton luggage.<br /><br />The Anderson formula also includes some exotic, vaguely creepy foreign woman, smoking, the previously mentioned jarring transition, a dash of postmodern, story-within-a-story meta, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray, and some music from The Kinks. Standard Wes fare.<br /><br />In "Darjeeling," none of it works. The random sex is crass, and the depiction of India, while not phony, is not terrible complete, either, seeing that the brothers spend most of their trip in the utter wilderness, where virtually no one lives. Anderson would have us believe Schwartzman has the looks and charm to attract women while the director buries Brody's natural electricity so he can play the "precious" brother. The roles should have been switched. Wilson's performance is supposed to be affecting because it came around the time of his suicide attempt; I guess I'm not so easily moved. His Francis is a particular irritant, both boorish and completely full of crap, easing off the gas pedal only after he's been lured into a fistfight. The brothers only seem that way in Jack's story-within-a-story, and, even then, we're not sure if it's an accurate evocation of their feelings, or just the middle brother's wishful thinking. Either way - who cares? "Anderson loses any non-conditioned member of the audience quickly in the first reel, tries a stab at pathos around halftime, and simply fritters about after that.<br /><br />Note: "The Darjeeling Limited" comes with a short film entitled "Hotel Chevalier," a prologue featuring Jack and his ex-girlfriend, played by Natalie Portman. Esoteric and bewildering, it's kind of 13-minute scene a college student might write, enthusiastically graded by a fiction professor. It lacks any humor whatsoever and any noticeable warmth, but Portman quickly becomes naked and says a naughty word. For some reason, it still turns some weirdos on when a smart, bright kid like Portman shows how much she can't act against her essential nature by dragging her fingernails in dirt.</p></body></html>

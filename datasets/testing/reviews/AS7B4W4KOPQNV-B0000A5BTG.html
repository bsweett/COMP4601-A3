It was a really dumb, but I was entertained nonetheless.  Don't see this is you are expecting a good movie just because it has a good cast.  But if your looking to laugh at a bad movie, then you will find this quite entertaining.  I'll just give you a quick summary of what this movie is about.  It stars Hilary Swank as a brilliant scientist/earthship pilot.  The world is about to be destroyed because the earth's core has stopped rotating, and everything is chaos.  In order to fix this little problem, Swank and some others must go down into the earth's core and shoot it with missiles or something along those lines, and get the roatation back in business.</p></body></html>

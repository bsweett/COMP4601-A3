<meta name="summary" content="Disgustingly hilarious"></head><body><p>I'm deeply ashamed to say that I loved this thing.  I was one of only a dozen people in the theater on a Thursday afternoon and I'm the only one that laughed.  As a matter of fact, I fell on the floor.<br /><br />The film is simultaneously disgusting, racist, vulgar and idiotic.  Cohen makes fun of society [which is OK] and of people who befriended him [which isn't].  His character--although impossibly naive--is a one hundred percent revolving jerk capable of the lowest stunt.  It's difficult to not arrive at the conclusion that Cohen is a self-made man, capable of incredible self-promotion.<br /><br />So why did I love it?  I'm not sure I really want to know.  By the way, I've been to Kazahkstan and, as far as I know, there is nothing like the 'running of the Jew.'<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

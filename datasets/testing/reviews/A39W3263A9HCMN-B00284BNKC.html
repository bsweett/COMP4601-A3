It was originally rated NC-17, and We still dunno wether it's R- rated of NC-17! Though I saw the R rated one, I still liked it.<br /><br />STORY: Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn) is a widow, who has a son named Harry. He has 2 friends, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They all get hooked on such drugs as Marijuanna, Cocaine, Heroin, etc. to start a new life. Meanwhile, Sara gets a call one day from an informercial Guru named Tappy Tibbons, and so She tries a diet which you can't have Red Meat, Preserved sugar, and Orgasms. But then "no"'s drive her crazy so she contacts a doctor,and gets addicted to dieting pills. But then, these people's addictions start to destroy their lives...<br /><br />THOUGHTS: KEEP AWAY FROM THE YOUNG CHILDREN! It contains sexual scenes that don't apply "good" for ages 10-17. But then again, This is an IMPORTANT FILM, and should it be shown to every friggin' JH ans SH school kid? YES. It will show you what drugs can do to you.<br /><br />So I'm hoping that you will buy this movie. It will mess with your head for a little, then it will make you realise that DRUGS KILL! SO PLEASE BUY IT!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DESPERATE SANITY AMIDST MADNESS"></head><body><p>Based on Ken Kesey's 1962 memoirish novel, the resulting movie's a timeless metaphor for the human condition.<br /><br />Sterling performances by the entire cast mesh perfectly under Milos Foreman's precise direction.  Jack Nicholson is the everyman who discovers a desperate sanity amidst the madness, but it's Louise Fletcher who steals the show as an unforgettable nurse devoid of compassion.</p></body></html>

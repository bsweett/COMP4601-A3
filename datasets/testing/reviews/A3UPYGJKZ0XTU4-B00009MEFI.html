Poor production."></head><body><p>New York City's last actual telephone booth with walls stands at 53rd St. and 8th Ave. Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is an ambitious publicist who is in the habit of conducting business on his cell phone while walking down 8th Avenue. He stops at that phone booth at the same time every day to call a young client with whom he likes to flirt. One day, as he is finishing up his calls, someone calls him. The phone in the booth rings. Stu answers. The caller doesn't identify himself, but asks that Stu listen while the caller telephones Stu's young client and reveals that Stu is married. The caller also insists that Stu telephone his wife, Kelly (Radha Mitchell), and confess his emotional infidelity to her. When Stu refuses, the caller demonstrates his power by shooting a toy that is on the ground next to the phone booth with a high powered rifle. And the game is on. The caller says that Stu is being punished for lying to his clients, colleagues and his wife. If Stu does not confess his sins and do exactly as the caller says, the caller will kill either Stu or a bystander. When the caller kills a man who is trying to pull Stu from the phone booth, it attracts the attention of the police, who blame Stu for the shooting. Police Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) is the senior officer on the scene, and he would like very much to avoid shooting Stu, who refuses to leave the phone booth. Stu must try to communicate to the police that there is a sniper holding him hostage while doing everything he can to prevent the sniper from claiming more victims.<br /><br />"Phone Booth" has an interesting premise. And Colin Farrell does a good job of conveying the extraordinary stress that Stu in under as he must negotiate for the lives of the bystanders while his own life is constantly threatened by both the sniper and the police. Farrell's performance is the stand-out element of this film., and I recommend "Phone Booth" to Colin Farrell fans for this reason. The ability of the caller to pull off such an elaborate game of extortion is a less credible. But what I really don't like about "Phone Booth" is its production. Director Joel Schumacher's tastes seem to have shifted from the height of overproduced extravagance in 1997's "Batman and Robin" to bargain basement production values in "Phone Booth". This movie just shouts "cheap". And since the production is so self-consciously chintzy, Schumacher thinks he can pass that off as style. Being able to make a good film on a small budget is great. Making a mediocre film that looks like it was made on a shoestring isn't. And what's with those blue filters? This film is blue. Ever since those bluish automobile advertisements became popular a few years ago, Hollywood has embraced the cyan cast far too widely. Even the grungiest neighborhoods in New York don't sport odd color casts, and who would want them to?</p></body></html>

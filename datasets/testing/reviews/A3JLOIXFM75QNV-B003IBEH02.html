I'm not entirely sure what Peter Jackson was trying to accomplish but in the end, The Lovely Bones is just a plain, weird film with fantastical elemets that seem entirely out of place.<br /><br />I have not read the book the film is based on, but from what I do know, it was changed up quite a bit. Either way, movie-wise, it is a big dissapointment. For a film that deals with a murdered child, a distraught family and a perverted serial killer, there isn't that much drama or mystery surrounding it.<br /><br />Saorise Ronan plays said murdered child, and she narrates the story from a heaven-type of place. She watches over her confused family and wishes for a life she can never have. It SHOULD be depressing and morose and painful, but I felt nothing of that. Is the movie a fantasy? Is it a mystery thriller? A redemption tale? It is very hard to place and the pacing really throws everything off. The killer is revealed, purposefully, pretty much in the beginning so suspense-wise, there isn't much there.<br /><br />The main problem, I think, lies with the fact that too much time was spent in the fantasy world which doesn't do much for the rest of the picture. It is two different worlds and they didn't mix all that well. I felt dissapointed as I had high hopes for this, especially after utterly adoring the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Even Jackson's earlier and brilliant Heavenly Creatures mixed elements of fantasy with perfect drama and it worked beautifully. Here, it falls flat and just feels plain odd. And the ending didn't help matters either. Hopefully, Jackson will get it right the next time around.</p></body></html>

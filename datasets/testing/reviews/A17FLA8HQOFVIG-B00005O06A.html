It is also the story of a period of time in American history beginning in the 1890s when it seemed that all was possible.  Its innovative film techniques also raised the standard to which the world of film would forevermore have to aspire. <p>The film begins with the death of the rich man, Charles Forster Kane.  The audience sees newsreel footage about his life and so the general outline is established early.  But when a newspaper reporter now interviews all the people who knew him well, the flashbacks tell the real story.  Orson Wells plays Kane in an outstanding performance, the use of makeup as well as his voice and body language making him age before our eyes.  Joseph Cotton plays his best friend.  And Agnes Moorehead has a small role as his mother.  The rest of the cast's names are less familiar today:  Ruth Warrick is cast as his first wife; Ray Collins as a corrupt politician; Everett Sloan as his business associate; Dorothy Comingore as his second wife.  They were all young unknowns then, and it was Orson Wells' skill that brought out outstanding performances from all.<p>The Turner Classic Edition of the video I watched included a short piece about the technical aspects of creating the film, which I found fascinating.  According to Robert Wise, who did the film editing, shooting though cheesecloth filled with sand to get a grainy effect created the newsreel shots.  Some shots were done from a camera that was actually placed below floor level and aimed upwards or a ceiling camera aimed downwards. The dominant characters had camera angles aimed upwards at them; the weaker characters were shot with camera angles aimed downward. The film is shot in black and white with high contrast, often having the foreground characters completely in shadow. Often, the features of a character are indistinct and shadowy and it is the voice that carried the action.  Other times, the entire scene is in what is called "deep focus" with every bit of it absolutely clear.  It was Wells' genius that made it all work so well.<p>The film moved fast and held my interest throughout.  There was never a lull or a dull moment because of the technique of overlapping dialog, which moved the viewer from one scene to another with maximum effect.  No detail was left out to make this a perfect film, which can be watched over and over again, just to see its unique composition.  I give this video my highest recommendation.  If you've never seen it, don't miss it.  If you've seen it before, see it again.</p></body></html>

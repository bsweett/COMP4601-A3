<meta name="summary" content="Insomnia Will Keep You Awake - Clever Film"></head><body><p>Director Christopher Nolan hit artistic and cinematic paydirt with his underappreciated, &quot;Memento&quot;.  This latest effort is different in style and story, but repeats all the same mysterious character flaws in a landscape that's as beautiful as it is foreboding.<p>Pacino, Williams and Swank all deliver spectacular performances and Pacino is incredible as the &quot;respected&quot; high ranking detective who has terrible secrets only to accidentally get in deeper.  His consience keeps him 'awake' and his craggy face and tired eyesacks show it.  Williams is just as creepy and frighteningly clever in his role, never reminding you that he is also a comedian.  Swank plays the young, awe-struck cop with ease, who also faces a problem of conscience as she gets to know her mentor, Pacino.  This secrecy and disallusionment seems to be the motif Nolan sets into the characters.<p>The scenery is spectacular, but also, as shown in several scenes, not to be trusted - just like the main characters.  <p>It's a tension filled, medium action film that will keep you mesmerized until the end.  It doesn't matter if the ending is slightly predictable, it's the ride that matters.<p>DVD includes all the typical Director's commentary (very interesting), making of documentary, theater trailers, etc.  Best of all is a sequence into the life of an 'insomniac'.  It gives the story all that more credibility.</p></body></html>

And whereas in those films we have the likes of Kirk Douglas, Richard Burton and Tony Curtis, in "Troy" we have Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. And it is a toss-up who is more gorgeous and glamorous: Pitt, Bana, Bloom or Kruger. All four are beautifully photographed as to defy description especially since so much of this film is shot as set pieces, tableaux.<p>Wolfgang Petersen directs in such a stodgy and stoic manner that much of the good acting work is lost amidst the sand and sandals mise en scene. We had hoped for a "Fall of the Roman Empire," instead we got "Cleopatra."<br />Nonetheless, there are a few scenes of uncommon grace: Peter O'Toole (as Priam) begging for the body of his slain son of Achilles (Brad Pitt), Thetis (Julie Christie) pleading with her son (Achilles) to remain uninvolved with the inevitable conflict between the Trojans and the Greeks. But these moments are few and far between.<br /> Unfortunately, "Troy" is ultimately a lost opportunity to say something important about the world. What it is is a limp flaccid comment on the ancient past: more concerned with surface, rather than interior beauty.<br />"Troy" goes on way too long for its own good: it could have been cut by at least twenty minutes. But the main problem is one of focus and point-of-view. Yes, these are beautiful people involved with life changing experiences but why should we care? What is it about their experiences that we can embrace now, hundreds of years later? Director Wolfgang Petersen has taken the easy road: he's shown us the glitz and the glam but he's left out his point-of-view. Wolfgang: we need to know how and why we should care beyond why Brad Pitt has forbidden your showing his toes on camera. And unfortunately that's about all we can think about when we watch "Troy."</p></body></html>

Ignored, for example, is the fact that his wife, the initially spunky and forceful, Alicia, is El Salvadorian, and while Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of her was well-done, she could have adopted a more Spanish-sounding accent for the part.<br /> While a bit beefy for the lead role, Russell Crowe submerges himself nicely into the character of the eccentric, socially inept John Nash, complete with a Southern twang. The film features the usual cornerstones of a Crowe performance: Displays of brute strength, moments of violent rage, pensive charm, subtle glances from his very expressive heavily-lashed blue-green eyes, quick and pleasant witticisms, a wry smile, and of course, his excerising his "right to bare arms", that last of which should keep the ladies interested.<br /> The story of course, revolves around Professor Nash's bout with schizophrenia, his major contribution to the world despite his illness, and his ultimate triumph as a Nobel Laurate.<br /> We first meet Nash as a loner at Princeton University about to work on his thesis, but not succeeding at doing so at first. There isn't too much emphasis on math itself, the least favorite subject of many of us in school, which was perhaps done to keep most of the audience interested in the film. But the palpable distance between Nash and the elderly faculty member being honored by the ceremony of the pens can be measured in light years, as Nash stands in the hallway, a lone and solitary figure once again on the outside.<br /> His life is made even more complicated by his roommate (Paul Bettany) and his roommate's adoptive niece who never ages(Vivien Cardone), as well as Government agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), who never changes his clothes.<br /> Christopher Plummer's Dr. Rosen appears on the scene to treat Nash, giving a calm intellectual, but slightly smug performance as the once esteemed Professor falls from grace and into his care.<br /> The scene on Nash's recipience of shock treatment is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's undergoing the same procedure in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". But while there is debate about how meticulously<br /> schizophrenia and the events of Nash's life are portrayed (his otherwise unmentioned son, whom he had out of wedlock plays an orderly in the film), Crowe makes Nash a very sympathetic character, and perhaps the film has led more people to empathize with the plight of the mentally ill.We feel somehow, that Alicia was meant to be the guiding force in his life, although in reality, the couple were divorced for a time.<br /> Later in the movie, there is another pens ceremony, but happily Nash is not at a distance from it this time.<br /> The make-up job of the Nashes as an elderly couple could have been better. But Nash's address of the Nobel Academy, which in fact never happened, gives the film a final, romantic flourish.<br /> The stately and haunting anthem sung by Charlotte Church is one of vigilance on behalf of those in need of guidance.<br /> While sparing us many gritty realities of the Nashes' life together, Ron Howard's movie is one of hope and triumph, with only a muted kind of joy because despite Nash's great achievements, the battle for sanity continues.</p></body></html>

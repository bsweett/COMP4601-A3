<meta name="summary" content="Fast-paced, well made zombie flick"></head><body><p>I don't care for most horror films except for a few from the 1930's and 40's. Most horror films today are little more than slice and dice butchery videos. This one is well made, fast paced,  suspenseful, and scary. It rises far above the genre because of good acting and directing. It is still little more than a zombie flick - but one that shows craft.</p></body></html>

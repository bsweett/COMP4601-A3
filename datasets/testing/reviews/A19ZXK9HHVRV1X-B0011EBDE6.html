As he did in his previous (though better) films, "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore," Anderson creates a slightly off-kilter world populated by benignly eccentric characters - only, in the case of "Darjeeling," the comedy is muted and the vision bland (making it more on a par with "The Life Aquatic" and "The Royal Tenenbaums," two of Anderson's lesser films).<br /><br />The price of Anderson's subtlety is that not a whole lot really seems to happen in the movie and the characters never get much of a chance to differentiate themselves from one another.  Each of the brothers is assigned a peculiarly defining quirk or eccentricity, but neither the actors nor the filmmakers (the movie was co-written by Schwartzman and Roman Coppola) seem to know quite what to do with them.  The result is that the comic bits fall flat, while the "meaningful" moments seem tacked on almost as an afterthought.<br /><br />Wilson (sporting a full head bandage throughout), Brody and Schwartzman do what they can with their roles but the monotonously deadpan tone of the comedy keeps them from breaking out on their own and engaging the viewer.</p></body></html>

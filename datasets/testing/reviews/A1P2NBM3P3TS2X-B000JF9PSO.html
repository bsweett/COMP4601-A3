<meta name="summary" content="Heartwrenching and horrifying"></head><body><p>I spent a great deal of time over the past 5 years since 9/11 speculating about what might have happened on the United 93 flight after the passengers found out about the morning's events.  Mostly, I questioned whether I would have had the courage to take action as some of the passengers evidently did, or if I would have cowered in a corner, a snivelling coward waiting to die and crying quick and hot tears over a life not lived to its fullest.<br /><br />Among the many emotional responses I had to this electrifying film when I saw it in a shamefully empty theatre the day it came out, "United 93" made me face that question again in a very aggressive and in-your-face way.  This isn't just a story of tragic events.  It is a story of human character.<br /><br />Equally terrified during the day's events were the various civilian and military airline control center employees.  Forced to act quickly and decisively when dealing with partial facts and a rapidly-unfolding terror timeclock, they were having to take action while the vast majority of people in the world were standing around dumbstruck and speechless.<br /><br />"United 93" covers the day's events in docudrama style from multiple agencies' perspectives and every single one of them draws you in and grabs you by the throat.<br /><br />I could hear people in the theatre stop breathing several times.  There was more than a little crying.<br /><br />Much was made in the press about how it may have been "too soon" to tell this story again in such a frank and brutally honest way.  Well guess what -- it some ways it will ALWAYS be too soon, but that doesn't mean the story shouldn't be told.  We all need to watch this to remind ourselves of how it felt to be so scared and emotionally raw.  Don't wait until you've let Time numb you to the day's events.<br /><br />This movie works on every level it intended to.  The fact that it is both difficult to sit through and impossible to turn away from is a testament to not only the powerful nature of the events themselves but also to the filmmakers' unflinching and honest presentation of them.<br /><br />This could have been a sappy melodramatic TV movie that pulled punches and glossed over painful details.  Instead, this film feels more "real" than any film in recent memory.<br /><br />When you watch it at home, please maximize the impact of the experience by recreating the Theatrical experience as best you can:  Turn off all the lights, unplug the phone, go the bathroom in advance, and keep the chatter down.<br /><br />This is too important an experience to treat like just another Weekday Night on the Couch.<br /><br />**** In spite of the fact that I am more convinced with each passing day that the conspiracy theorists about 9/11 may actually be telling the ugly truth, I still will re-iterate that "United 93" is a stunningly powerful work of dramatic cinema.  Whether the significant details are even remotely true or not, it doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the story as told by this film.  Is that disclaimer objective enough? ****</p></body></html>

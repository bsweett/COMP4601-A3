Top drawer acting by Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi. A few lapses in logic creep in here and there, but you'll still be gripped by the rest of the film. Kinda functions like a play, most of the movie takes place in one location,where everyone involved in the robbery tries to figure out what had gone wrong. Everyone who is in the movie dies except for maybe seven people. No women in at all in the film, either. Just slick villains who lose control over a tense situation. Strong stomachs are advised for certain scenes, and an ability to not be offended easily might help. The kids would love it, but this is a very adult affair. A keeper, worth buying.</p></body></html>

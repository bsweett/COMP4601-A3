<meta name="summary" content="Funny, good original story, but a bit long for a comedy."></head><body><p>I liked shawn of the dead, and so this one was a no brainer to buy. Well, its good, but a bit long. I really wanted to see how the movie ended, so the story was good, and the humor was there, but about mid movie, I had figured it out and just wanted to see the ending.  The movie revolves around London's best police officer getting transferred to Samford because he's to good, I.E. he makes the rest of the cops look bad.  Well, little did he know he was going to walk a nice country villiage and discover a hidden secret about the population and the smoke and mirrors the town is built on.  Anyway, if you liked Shawn of the Dead, then the humor in this one is perfect for you.</p></body></html>

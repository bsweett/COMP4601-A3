I was aware that Ian McEwan is a celebrated modern author but little else.  In short, I saw this film with absolutely no preconceived ideas.<br /><br />"Atonement" is an absolutely captivating film.  Initially, it seemed like an English period piece.  Yet, gradually it revealed an enthralling plot.  A young girl's misconstrued evidence before the police results in life changing events for the film's main characters.  The backdrop is the 1930s and then the Second World War before the full story is revealed in the current day.<br /><br />Keira Knightley and James McAvoy are brilliant as the lead characters.  Their<br />two characters are the love interest of the film.  Although they both come from<br />very different backgrounds, their attraction to each other is obvious.  The outset of the film, in particular, has real sexual frisson.  Their lives, however, are soon torn asunder.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the film there is a wonderful cameo piece by Vanessa Redgrave.  It is her character that ties up all the loose ends.  And these ends are very sad indeed.  I'll say no more for fear of spoiling the film for others.<br /><br />"Atonement" won the Golden Globe Award for best film.  This was well warranted.  The film is a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

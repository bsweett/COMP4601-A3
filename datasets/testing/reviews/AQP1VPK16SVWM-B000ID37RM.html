<meta name="summary" content="Peck's finest performance in a role that fits him like a suit"></head><body><p>The word "classic" is liberally applied to just about any film that made any list or won any award over the past 100 years of cinema. It's a word that has been cheapened by its overuse in marketing. "To Kill a Mockingbird" defines the word classic. It's not because of the top notch production although that's part of it. This film belongs to an era when craftsmanship was an important part of storytelling. In our world of rapid fire cutting where bodies pile up faster than the credits pass by, we've lost touch with the sensibility that informs this classic film. Robert Mulligan's sensitive direction, Gregory Peck's iconographic performance and a literate, intelligent script by Horton Foote ("Lonesome Dove") that doesn't pander to the audience makes "To Kill a Mockingbird" one of those rare films that deserve the term classic and also deserves to be  on every best list for films made during the 20th century.<br /><br />Based on Harper Lee's popular novel, "Mockingbird" tells the story of widower Atticas Finch (Peck) a small town  southern attorney who tackles the difficult defense of African American Tom Robinson (the late Brock peters) accused of raping the Caucasian daughter of a racist father (James Anderson). The film doesn't just focus on the rape trial though as it also chronicles the little things in Atticas' life that go right and wrong; his daughter Scout (Mary Badham) faces criticism at school for defending an African American and also her shift from tomboy to young lady. She and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) tell tales of the local bogeyman Boo (Robert Duvall)who lives down the lane and sharing their views on the adult world that passes them by. The film is informed with the southern atmosphere but ironically was shot entirely on Universal's backlot in Southern California. It would have been very easy to portray Atticas as a paragon of virtue. He's well meaning but just as flawed as everybody else in the town and that includes missing cues during the trial that could prove Tom's innocence early on. The fact that everyone-from the children to the adults-all treated with respect as to their view of the world makes "Mockingbird" an enduring classic that aged incredibly well. Like the best wines the rich themes in this film continue to resonate and intoxicate an audience nearly fifty years after the film was made. That's a testament to great filmmaking. While director Mulligan and producer Pakula would make a number of other notable and powerful films, this is the first pillar in their long careers and because of its strength the rest of their best films could be made.<br /><br />Universal has taken a lot hard knocks lately about the quality of their DVD releases and lack of extras. They should also be recognized for the exceptional job they've done with this re-release. The black and white images are truly startling with rich fine detail, an exceptional gray scale and sharp image quality. The soundtrack is equally good with a top notch 5.1 new transfer as well as the original 2.0 mono soundtrack..<br /><br />The features on disc one include Peck's acceptance speech for his Academy Award for the role of Finch, Peck's remarks at the American Film Institute Award ceremony honoring him. There's also an excerpt from the Academy tribute to Peck with Cecilia Peck remarking on the passing of her father. Finally there's "Scott Remembers" an interview with Mary Badham about working with Peck as a child actor.<br /><br />The second disc features the bulk of the extras with two marvelous documentaries one of them brand new to this edition. "A Conversation with Gregory Peck" directed by Barbara Kopple and produced by Peck's daughter isn't the usual intimate one-on-one chats were used to seeing. Instead, Kopple films an appearance by Peck in Boston to discuss his work as an opportunity to look at his life and career. Peck comes across with his usual sense of sincerity and is engaging. The documentary "Fearful Symmetry" about the making of the film was available on the previous DVD. Director Charles Kiselyak interviews everyone from director Mulligan to the now adult child actors that appeared in the film discussing not only Lee's world but how it was reflective of the world they grew up and lived in when the film was made. Interweaving that footage with location interviews with the people of the town that Lee wrote about in the book (where she herself grew up) , it's a fascinating glimpse into the fantasy vs. reality of Lee's world and how they intersect. We also get reproductions of the original posters for the film as part of the package from its exhibition around the world. Universal has done a truly spectacular job with this re-release to commemorate this classic film.<br /><br />Luckily Mulligan and Pakula (both now deceased) did a commentary for an earlier edition of the film. That commentary appears yet again on this edition. While there's long passages of silence, that's OK; neither man blabbers on instead making very focused precise comments about the making of the film and their intent.<br /><br />A truly outstanding release from Universal, I'd highly recommend "To Kill a Mockingbird" for purchase. If you have the earlier edition, this edition does offer the advantage of a new documentary, the lobby cards as well as a brilliant transfer of the classic film while retaining most of the extras from the previous edition. It's well worth visting with Atticas Finch and his family again.</p></body></html>

I can hardly see things clearly. That makes it's very difficult for me to enjoy it. There are a lot of fighting and bloody scenes but there's no suspense at all. The first installment of Predator and the second of Aliens are much more engaging and suspenseful.<br /><br />It's worth renting for curiosity.</p></body></html>

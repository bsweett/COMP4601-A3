<meta name="summary" content="The ins and outs of sibling love..."></head><body><p>Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is a naughty party girl. We first meet her when she's throwing up in the rest room of a nightclub, a young hunk hovering over her in disgust. Insecure and neglected, she's been coasting through life basically on her looks. But time is steadily catching up with her; she can no longer rely on her tarty beauty and her ability to beguile men as much as she used to.<br /><br />Her more introverted sister Rose (Toni Collette) is Maggie's mirror opposite: She's superficially a mess - a slightly overweight workaholic who settles for finding love in the pages of romance novels. She buys shoes because they are the only item of clothing that fits her properly, and marvels at her handsome boss' presence in her bed, even taking a photo of him to prove that he is actually there.<br /><br />Both these sisters are insecure, but in different ways and about different things. With Maggie passed out drunk, Rose needs to come pick her up. When she tries to take Maggie back to their father's house, however, she's barred at the door by their evil stepmother, who insists Rose take her sister home with her. Maggie steals from and betrays Rose, she helps herself to her sister's expensive shoes, ice cream, and other stuff that she knows she's no supposed to take.<br /><br />Rose is obviously angry with her sister's laziness and lack of ambition, yet she is reluctant to evict her, when Maggie betrays Rose in a moment of thoughtlessness, a gigantic rift is caused between them. Finally evicted, she boards a bus to Florida without a word to anyone, hooking up with her long lost grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine). Ella helps Maggie get back on track, finding her a job as a hospice worker and helping her start a business as a personal shopper for the assisted-living set. Rose meanwhile comes to terms with her insecurities by quitting her job and becoming a part-time dog walker and even gaining a new boyfriend (Mark Feuerstein) in the process.<br /><br />In Her Shoes is all about the ups and downs of sibling love between injured and self-doubting opposites. And while this issue has obviously been movingly explored in other movies, rarely has it been tackled with such emotional honesty. Although In her Shoes may be earnest, and contemporary, and it certainly highlights the needs and insecurities of women; the film is not that ironical - apart from the fact that Maggie and Rose are apprehensive about different things, and it's interestingly un-cynical; there's definitely no room for cutting-edge, or clever hipness in director Curtis Hanson's world.<br /><br />Instead we have a heart felt and well acted drama that is more interested in flirting around the mysteries of a love-hate relationship and selling the message of the importance of family and that everything's probably going to turn out alright in the end. For Rose, salvation and deliverance comes in the form of exotic food and a man who disregards her propensity to put on the pounds and can finally love her for whom she is, and for Maggie it comes in the form of newly found confidence, insight, responsibity, and even poetry!<br /><br />The acting is generally top-notch, with the incredible Ms. Collette, with her horsy laugh and wide, puppy dog eyes proving that she's one of the most versatile actors around. And Shirley MacLaine does a nicely understated turn as Grandma Ella, but it is Cameron Diaz who is the real find here, giving one of her best performances in years as the irresponsible, good for nothing vamp Maggie.<br /><br />In Her Shoes lacks originality and is fairly formulaic fare, but it builds to a surprising level of emotional power, and makes up for its shortcomings with its understated intelligence, sensitivity and finely attuned sense of character. Hanson is a restrained but confident director who knows that an audience will remain engaged to a story, no matter how prescribed, as long as people they care about populate it.

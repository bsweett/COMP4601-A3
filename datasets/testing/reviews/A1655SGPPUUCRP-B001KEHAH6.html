<meta name="summary" content=""A comedy for the kid in all of us.""></head><body><p>"13 Going on 30" is a slightly-above average tween-targeted romantic comedy/"Big" rip-off/star vehicle for the up-and-coming Jennifer Garner.  I suppose that there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching the adorable Garner pretend, and quite believably I might add, to be a teenager.  For "what it is", "13 Going on 30" is a cute, enjoyable comedy that just may bring some tears to your eyes during its surprisingly emotional climax (depending on your personal life, I suppose.)  Despite the hokey musical montages and some inevitable chick-flick "cheesy stuff", such as a bunch of adults joyfully dancing to Michael Jackson's "Thriller".<br /><br />Anyways, it's not like my opinion, or any professional opinion for that matter (not that I'm a professional by any means!) matters when it comes to this sort of movie.  "13 Going on 30" is the kind of movie you're going to see despite the reviews just because you love chick-flicks.  Or maybe your daughter will drag you along to see it.  Or maybe you're a big Garner fan.  Or a Mark Ruffalo fan.  Or maybe you're just feeling nostalgic for more innocent times.</p></body></html>

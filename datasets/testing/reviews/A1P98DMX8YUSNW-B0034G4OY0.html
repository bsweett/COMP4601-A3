They keep the religious overtones on the down-low. They ask why we wonder what happens when we die. It's a million-year-old question that started with the Egyptians, or probably before. There are no answers. The film takes its time to build. Some may say it's slow. I think it's paced just right. There's a great opening sequence that shows the Indonesian tsunami in frightening realism. Great CGI work there. I was worried we were in for some gory deaths early on, but that's not the case. Worth watching.</p></body></html>

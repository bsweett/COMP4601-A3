<meta name="summary" content="Really Good Movie"></head><body><p>I really enjoy Ron Howard's "The Da Vinci Code". Its intresting, thought provoking, and thrilling. Decent performences, great direction and a well thoughtout story make this a good film in my opinion. I am glad to own the DVD and the Special Edition does the film justice. If you are intrested in religious themed films (though the events and history in the film are fake) or into conspiracy films, you will enjoy this.</p></body></html>

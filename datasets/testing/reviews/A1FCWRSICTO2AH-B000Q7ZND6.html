The sheer laziness of director Francis Lawrence is amazing.  The editing of the film makes the story nearly incoherent.  And the script?  At one point Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) tells John Constantine (Reeves) that she fears demons have killed her (twin) sister.  Less than five minutes later she tells Constantine that she doesn't believe in the Devil!  Whoa! Doesn't someone, while filming or editing, red flag such inconsistencies?<br /><br />As far as the twin sister goes, that's one red herring among many - like the Spear of Destiny, insane angels, brainless "soldier" demons (what's the difference?), and voodoo magicians.  Much is made here of Weisz's (the "Mummy" lady) performance.  I don't know why.  She simply doesn't have the lines to deliver her from the mess she's in.  Reeves?  "Constantine" is just further evidence that he's an earlier generation's Ben Affleck.  He can't act.  And with "Constantine," and its loads of special effects, he can't be insulated (this time) from that fact.  Interestingly there are two characters that do make an impression.  Tilda Swinton as gender bent angel Gabriel, who has you wondering if Gwyneth Paltrow and David Bowie have morphed into one person, and Peter Stormare's Satan.  Stormare's performance is a particular hoot.  He looks like he wandered in from the set of "Caberet," and he clearly elevates things at a moment when I seemed past caring.  For that alone I'll give "Constantine" two stars.  The rest can go to Hell.</p></body></html>

What's not to like about this movie??? Based  on the classic book- a boy who has begun to doubt Santa exsist and is slowly losing the magic of Christmas hops onbroad the Polar Express and travels to the North Pole.<br /><br />On the train meeting kids who truly believe or having Christmas doubts themselves.<br /><br />Arriving at the North Pole in an unbelievable holiday scene he slowly realizes that believeing is seeing what you can't. Upon meeting Santa and making some friends on the Polar Express. This precious little boy realizes Santa exsists in the hearts of all who believe.<br /><br />Tom Hanks as always in OUTSTANDING performing in mulitply roles in the movie. The animation is simply beautiful better than "Finding Nemo" or "Shrek" for each scene and frame looks like your watching an moving oil painting.<br /><br />The songs are beautiful and will get you into the holiday spirit.<br /><br />In short this movie is PURE genius... but, to my surprise the kids in my family did not like the story that much-probably because they could not relate. As an adult- I totally understood the emphsasis placed in the movie- that as you get older the magic slowly dies and the spirit/excitement about Christmas does as well. So when I saw the final scene I couldn't help but cry for I knew that I will NEVER again be able to hear the sound of that precious bell-that rings for those who believe.<br /><br />This movie is a rare Christmas movie- that is solely focused on the true nature/spirit of Christmas. If your an adult you simply MUST rent or buy this movie this season you'll find yourself-wishing you could still believe. 5-Stars All the Way!</p></body></html>

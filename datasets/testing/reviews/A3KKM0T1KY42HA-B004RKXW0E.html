I know this for sure because at the top of the Amazon Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack product page it says, "You purchased this item on November 28, 2001." Wow...how time flies.<br /><br />So it was to my surprise that when my son, now 11, stayed home from school with a cold earlier this year, I found him watching Toy Story. He had just put the DVD in the player, so I sat with him for a second before I headed off to work. Then the second turned into a few minutes; then a few minutes turned into a nostalgic hour; which of course turned into, "What a great, classic movie, Dad; Let's watch Toy Story 2!" So I obliged. (I hope my boss isn't reading this.)<br /><br />I'd forgotten what classics Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are. And it turns out that Toy Story 3 is just as classic as the first two. Not only do these movies deserve just a viewing, they deserve to be added to your movie collection. Watched the Blu Ray version last night with the entire family, and had to buy the standard DVD today, because my 7 year old daughter insisted that she needs to be able to watch the movie several times...but "upstairs" where i don't have a Blu Ray player set up. No problem. I may be biased because of the strong emotional attachment that I found that I had and have renewed with these movies, but I say that all three Toy Story movies truly are collectors' items.<br /><br />While watching Toy Story 3 last night, just as when I watched the first two again earlier this year, I was laughing out loud, holding in the sobs and just plain enjoying perhaps the best animated movies ever to come out of Disney.<br /><br />The first is about Andy's (6 - 8 years old?) toys and what happens when Andy introduces his new Buzz Lightyear to the group of toys that he grew up with. But the toys better be sure to stay out of the hands of Andy's next door neighbor Sid, because Sid's idea of fun is toy torture! Then in Toy Story 2 it's spring cleanup time, and the toys better hide if they don't want to end up in the yard sale; especially if you're a rare toy and there are greedy toy collectors that would just love to have...er..I mean...sell you. Finally in Toy Story 3 Andy is all grown up and the Toys have to deal with wondering if Andy will take them to college (a bad bet), keep them in his room (probably not or....Donate them or....Throw them out in the trash?!?<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are once again magic together in Toy Story 3 and they are joined by a cast of many many A-list voice talents...Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head is my favorite (ya hockey puck!).<br /><br />And one more note, if you've ever seen the Buzz Lightyear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004T2SJ">Disney Channel spinoff</a> but not the movies, don't be dissuaded by the spinoff because it was silly in comparison; the movies are head and shoulders above the spinoff in acting, animation and storywise.<br /><br />I'd grab the whole collection and see Toy Story 1 & 2 before 3 if you haven't already...it really puts things in perspective to watch it chronologically. Either way, get it into your cart then enjoy...with or without some kids!</p></body></html>

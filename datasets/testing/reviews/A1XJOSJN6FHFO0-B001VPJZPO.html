Ben has just suffered a stroke which has left him mute and crippled.When Caroline arrives she finds the entire atmosphere cloaked in mystery and is reluntent to stay, but the lawyer of the family talks her into it.  As time moves on Caroline finds out that Hoodo is practiced there, only to protect the house from secrets of long ago, or at least that is what she is told.<br /><br />I'm telling you I never saw the ending of this movie coming. I thought I had it all figured out but the conclusion was shocking and downright spooky.  If you want a mystery, thriller and a real 'creep me out,' movie this one is for you. I still think about it from time to time and shudder.</p></body></html>

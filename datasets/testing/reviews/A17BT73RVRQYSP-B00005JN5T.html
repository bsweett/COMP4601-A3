<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Funny"></head><body><p>Dustin Hoffman plays off DeNiro even better than in Wag the Dog and Barbara proves that whatever her shortcomings in political opinion, she can act and produce laughs in this wonderful sequel to Meet the Parents.<br /><br />There is very little to not like in this movies as once again Ben Stiller underplays himself and lets everything around him shine.  There are too many funny moments in this film and it would be a crime to give spoilers to any of them, so I would just suggest watching it.<br /><br />All the cast from the first movie continues to shine to the point that there isn't much left to add.  Only the totally expected ending makes this movie lose its last star.</p></body></html>

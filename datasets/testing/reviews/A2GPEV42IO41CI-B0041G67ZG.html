<meta name="summary" content="Kidman and Penn shine in political thriller"></head><body><p>This complex thriller concerns U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), who grew up in a war-torn African country, now ruled by dictator Dr. Zuwanie.  She overhears (or does she?) a plot to kill Zuwanie at the UN in three days.  Secret Service agent Keller (Sean Penn) is assigned to protect her and to see if she has any involvement in the plot.  He learns Silvia was active in the anti-Zuwanie movement back home, where her parents and siblings were killed by him.  As the day of Zuwanie's appearance at the U.N. approaches, several attempts are made on Silvia's life.  But is she an innocent caught up in a political storm or is she an assassin?<br /><br />Kidman is great as the mysterious interpreter who is filled with her grief and her ideals, and maybe is not what she seems.  Penn gives a refreshingly understated performance as a dedicated agent and recently-bereaved husband.  The script avoids a clich&eacute; romance between the two stars, but shows their connection to be heartfelt, nonetheless.  Filmed entirely in New York City, there is a constant sense of danger, helped by an intense and energetic soundtrack.  This movie is not particularly scary or violent, but succeeds because of the fine acting of the two stars and a script that makes you pay attention and think about what you are watching.  Heartily recommended.</p></body></html>

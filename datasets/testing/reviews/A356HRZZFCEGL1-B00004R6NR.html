You don't have to be a paleontology or prehistoric animal or dinosaur buff (as I am), or have seen JP in the theater after waiting at 10 p.m. in insanely snaky long lines (as I did) or own the VHS video or Michael Crichton novel that inspired JP (as I do) to appreciate the movie's special status in movie lore as the source of realistically animated extinct beasts. Yep, JP is immortal. But it is not perfect. Why? Well, it's the insidiously asinine and anticlimactic climax!<br /><br /> Our intrepid team has cleverly eluded the velociraptors throughout the extended chase sequence at the island center culminating in the atrium with the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. However, the cunning theropods have surrounded the team. How does the team escape? One more brilliant plan? No! The T-rex which battered and spit out the tour jeeps earlier in the movie materializes behind them out of nowhere to chomp on and spit out the raptors and smash his skeletal relative, and provide the necessary distraction for our crew to flee!!! Our toothy savior! Wow, how does a 3-7 ton salivating monster sneak up behind you unnoticed? How did he get into the atrium anyway? Presumably, he must have broken through a back wall. But why? What is his motivation? Why chase puny humans when he has his pick of fleshy hadrosaurs, ornithomimids, or ceratopsians to hunt? Admittedly, the sequence is exciting, but it really is just a dumb version of the "god (dinosaur) in the machine".<br /><br />I understand Spielberg was so impressed with the T-Rex that he couldn't resist bringing it back for the JP climax. Shame on him! He should have resisted the urge. Even the center exploding would have been a better climax.<br /><br />Is it too late to make or discover an alternate ending?<br /><br />P.S.:  JP does not have many illogical scenes, but another one recently came to mind.  Of course, everyone remembers the glass of water rippling from the T-Rex's vibrating footsteps.  God knows I love monsters that can make the ground vibrate with their footsteps.  However, the T-Rex stomping around like Godzilla really does not make much sense.  Everyone knows that if a predator wishes to capture prey, it does not announce its presence until the very last second, when the prey has no chance of escape.  Any unusual noise, like STOMPING, would scare the prey away.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Very Talented Group of Women in a Very Funny Comedy"></head><body><p>The latest film from super-producer Judd Apatow seems out to prove that women can be just as funny, and raunchy, as men. Starring SNL-veteran Kristen Wiig (who also co-wrote the script with Annie Mumolo), Bridesmaids isn't much of a departure from other Apatow-produced comedies, containing the same improvisational, gross-out humor that typically characterizes his films, with the only difference being it has a cast lead by women. I saw the film in a theatre that was about 95% full, with about 85% women, and the other 10% husbands that were dragged to the show by their wives. There is a target audience for Bridesmaids and while it can be enjoyed by both sexes, the women laughed hysterically at every joke I didn't laugh at...Or perhaps it was just every joke. If you fall into this target audience, you may enjoy the film more than I did...And I actually quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />Wiig plays Annie, whose personal life is in a state of turmoil. Her cake shop has gone under, leaving her to slave away at a jewelry store, she's low on money, and the only man in her life (an uncredited Jon Hamm, who, if you'll excuse the pun, is hamming it up and seems to be having fun) is a little too honest about their relationship status. In the midst of all this, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), Annie's friend since childhood, has recently become engaged and has asked Annie to be her Maid of Honor. She also selects four bridesmaids; Helen (Rose Byrne), Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), Becca (Ellie Kemper), and her fianc&eacute;e's sister Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Adding to Annie's personal troubles is her insecurity over Lillian's friendship with Helen, who takes charge of nearly all of the wedding details. Meanwhile, Annie meets a sweet Irish cop named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) while the stress of Lillian's wedding piles on.<br /><br />The six women that lead the ensemble each have a different style of humor that both fits in with and complements the film perfectly. There is, however, an unspoken and rarely discussed rule of ensemble comedies that dictate two things: (a) no less than one character will be underutilized, in this case Becca, the na?ve newlywed and (b) one character must stand-out from the rest due to the way they contrast with the main characters, in this case Megan, the odd, overweight sister of the groom. Each actress is very funny in her own way, with Wiig convincingly embodying Annie and scoring many laughs throughout. McLendon-Covey as Rita, an unsatisfied wife and mother, has a hilarious deadpan that seemed to really click with the audience. If I were to speculate I'd say that Rita touches on the things that mothers would never say out loud. The whole cast had me laughing at various points in the film, but it is McCarthy whom I would call my personal favorite and, in my eyes, is the star of the show.<br /><br />I admit to being easily amused and I have found terrible comedies passable because of my lack-of-resistance to amusement. It's easy to make me smile, chuckle, or even laugh a little bit. What doesn't come easily to me is full-on, gut-busting, teary-eyed laughter. From the first moment McCarthy appears onscreen as Megan, she had me in tears and, to my surprise, this happened again and again nearly every time she appeared onscreen. Yes, she plays a character not unfamiliar to the world of comedy, but she brings such a unique charm and comedic presence to the role. There are moments with her character that are built on gross-out gags, but, shamefully, I laughed. In fact, McCarthy made me laugh harder than I can ever recall laughing in a theatre. This is not hyperbole; she had me in stitches.<br /><br />The gross-out humor in Bridesmaids does not go anywhere we haven't seen men go in thousands of comedies over the years. There is one particular scene at a dress boutique that sent most of the theatre into riotous fits of laughter. I wonder to myself if Wiig included the scene to make a point about double-standards in film, as no one complains when men do the same thing in movies. Well, I do; I'm not a fan of humor that revolves around flatulence and bodily functions. To me, it's nothing more than lazy writing and, while my theatre seemed to place me in the minority, I found it more repulsive than funny. As, by Hollywood standards, the cast is made up of average-looking women (a good thing, as it's easier for an audience to connect with Wiig and Rudolph, who look like normal people), I do wonder if this scene would have elicited the same laughter from a cast of big-star, Hollywood bombshells. Either way, I would have no complaints about this scene being left on the cutting-room floor.<br /><br />While the film starts off strong, I feel it loses steam in the second half when it veers towards a more dramatic route and becomes weighed down by its own seriousness. Apatow films seem to follow this template often; a first hour of non-stop hilarity and a second of turgid drama. I am being a bit rough on the dramatic elements here, as they have a good message and are essentially well handled, just not as effectively as the comedy. I attribute this to the writing; the comedy is improvisational and spontaneous, which leaves the dramatic stuff feeling more scripted. Annie's romance with the Irish cop, for example, is cute and sweet, but overly predictable. Fortunately, the film is kept consistently entertaining by this very talented group of women, but a little more consistency in the storytelling wouldn't have hurt.<br /><br />It's not perfect and with a 125-minute running time (with trailers, you're looking at a theatre experience of 2 hours and 20 minutes) it could have been trimmed a bit in the editing room, but Bridesmaids is still one of the surprise comedies of the year. I knew women could be raunchy, but I doubted their ability to carry a raunchy comedy themselves. Wiig, (especially) McCarthy, and the rest of the girls outdo themselves, bringing both charm and consistent hilarity to the proceedings. Far exceeding my expectations, Bridesmaids is the funniest film I've seen this year.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best and most inspired American Comedy of the Nineties!"></head><body><p>The amazing introduction in which we watch two puppets conducted by versatile hands works out into perfection because the best is yet to come.<br /><br />This is one of those few films you love from the first five minutes running time. This a genial cross between Terry Gilliam, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and Woody Allen. Surreal and irreverent; caustic and astonishing; unexpected and provocative.<br /><br />In the seven and a half floor of a building ( a hidden homage to the desperation and troubles of Marcello in 8 ? perhaps?), the people is obligated to walk like a hunchback and this several deviation leads to unexplored realities. This bizarre office encloses a secret; a portal - an illegal but unexpected device - who lands in the intimate territory of John Malkovich 's mind. During fifteen minutes. Interesting cipher: Do you remember my kind reader about the famous fifteen glory minutes of every human being must live according Andy Warhol?<br /><br />Three different attitudes will turn around that surprising discovery : admiration in first instance and then a clever vehicle to get his unstoppable desire by John Cussack, a gold mine to make easy money by his job partner and the unexpected reaction of his beloved wife who discovers - a Woody Allen typical lure - behind her exaggerated devotion for the animals (their home is almost a zoo) the true sexual vocation.<br /><br />As  you may expect the existential anguish, delirious obsession, greed and the cruel torture that means for Malkovich when he feels invaded his intimacy for outer Peeping Toms will make o you to break the logic links and enjoy and plunge in those weird but not least funny and hyper original script.<br /><br />Two previous movies come to my mind that may be close in this sense: All of me and Zelig, both films deconstruct the ego and rebuild them, but demanding its prize (nothing is free).<br /><br />John Cussack is terrific in his role. He is nowadays, one of the most versatile and talented actors of the American Cinema. Cameron D&iacute;az is brilliant as the neurotic wife and finally a sincere ovation for the artistic direction.</p></body></html>

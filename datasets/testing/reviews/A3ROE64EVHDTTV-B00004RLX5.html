Some of it is quite memorable.<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*Storyline is great; an interesting departure from the story-arc of the last two films that ties everything together nicely.<br />*Characters are still good.  You get to learn one or two more things about them all.  Good acting.<br />*This is mostly a comedy, so there are loads of funny scenes.  Lots of memorable dialogue.  Good writing.<br />*Strong themes about the environment and saving the whales from extinction.<br />*Music is good (uses a different, more upbeat theme).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Ummm...<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It almost seems too different in a way; can be good or bad.<br /><br />This is definately the funniest and most light-hearted of the bunch.  Aside from the continuing "Star Trek" storyline and a number of great special effects, the story is dominated largely by hilarious dialogue and scenes as the crew travels back in time and tries to fit into an urban environment.  On top of it all, it has some  very strong messages about preserving our environment.  Altogether, it'll leave you smiling.<br /><br />The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality.  The two-disc version has good quality and a number of featurettes and trailers.</p></body></html>

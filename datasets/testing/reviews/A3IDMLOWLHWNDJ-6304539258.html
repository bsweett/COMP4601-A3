Luke doesn't know who the girl is, but, who she refers to in the message might refer to an old wizard/hermit that lives beyond the "Dune Sea". Luke and the droids go in search of the old man & find him after having a savage run in with the local scavengers. Luke finds out that the old man is indeed Obi-Wan Kenobi and informs Luke that he's also a Jedi Knight and fought alongside Luke's dad in the Clone Wars, as a General.<br />Artoo replays the message for Obi-Wan. The message is actually a desperate plea for help from Princess Leia Organa of the planet Aldreaan. Her message states the Galactic Empire, led by the sinister Sith Lord & former apprentice failure of Obi-Wan's, Darth Vader, has a secret weapon called The Death Star (a space station that can destroy an entire planet) that is ready for use, & can bring great upheaval to the galaxy, certain victory for the evil Empire & certain death to the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom amongst the galaxy. However, stored in Artoo's memory banks are the schematic plans to the Death Star, that contains a major weakness that ultimately can destroy the station. Kenobi's mission is to bring the R2 unit to her father, Senator Organa, on Alderaan so the plans can be secretly delivered to the rebels. Unfortunately, Vader finds out about the missing droids ("Star Wars" opens with the memorable and spectacular space battle above Luke's homeworld of Tatooine with Artoo & Threepio escaping there captured vessel and landing on the planet) and sends hundreds of Imperial Stormtroopers to search for them. The Troopers follow the tracks and inevitably follow them to Luke's homestead (Luke returns home to find the homestead burnt to the ground and the charred remains of his aunt and uncle). Luke, now an Imperial fugitive, decides to help Obi-Wan and to be trained in the ways of the Jedi & The Force, just like his father. The boys head to the local spaceport and book passage with Han Solo, Captain of The Millenium Falcon & his Wookie co-pilot, Chewbacca.<br />But, upon arrival to Alderaan the crew finds out that the planet is the first victim of The Death Star & Alderaan is reduced to nothing more than a meteor shower. The Millenium Falcon is then caught in a tractor beam by The Death Star and is pulled into the massive space station. Through some slick manuevering, the boys go undetected by the Imperial Forces and find out that in order to escape the battle station, the tractor beam needs to be shutdown. Obi-Wan volunteers to shutdown the energy beam at its source, while Luke, Han, Chewie, and the droids remain behind. That plan falls apart as Artoo discovers that Princess Leia is on board, being held as a prisoner with a stay of execution. Luke convinces Han, & Chewie to rescue the endangered princess while the droids stay behind awaiting Obi-Wan's return. The rescue is a success, but, Obi-Wan's past catches up with him as Darth Vader tracks him down through usage of The Force and through, the now legendary, lighsabre duel (a trademark in every "Star Wars" film) Obi-Wan Kenobi falls (and becomes one with The Force) by Darth Vader's blade. The boys with Princess Leia all meet up on board The Millenium Falcon and blast off from The Death Star. Unfortunately, a homing beacon is secretly stored on board the Falcon and leads the battle station to the rebel's hidden fortress. Through the classic final battle Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and learns that The Force will be with him always. <p>An awesome film and always a standout, "Star Wars" revived its dying genre (put it this way if it wasn't for "Star Wars", "Alien" would be first thought of as an illegal Mexican, instead of the space creature, "Star Trek" may have been a success but only limited to television, & "The X Files" would still be locked in a filing cabinet just to name a few). The film is steeped in mythology from around the world & has tons of characters (everyone has a favorite "Star Wars" character). <p>"Star Wars" was released on 5/25/77 in 43 theaters,  has grossed 460 million dollars in the U.S. alone, has a place in The Library of Congress, is #16 on The American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time, & has been nominated for 12 Acadeny Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor & won 6 of those awards including Best Score, Sound, Editing, Set Direction, Costume Design & of course, Visual Effects. The Force is forever is putting it mildly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Never dig something out of the ice."></head><body><p>First off, the movie is a classic based on the story, Who Goes There?, and is as timeless as you can get.  A group of men are trapped in a remote Antarctic research station after finding out that among them is a shape changing alien.<br /><br />The special effects hold up, mostly because they are rarely used.  This movie is about the story and the twelve male characters who interact together, trying to survive.<br /><br />The DVD has a commentary track with Kurt Russell and John Carpenter, a 80 minute documentary about the making of the movie, lots of extras in the form of photos, outtakes, behind-the-scenes location footage and more.<br /><br />A must for any sci-fi fan or Kurt Russell fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Visually stunning -- however, the plot...uh, the plot...?"></head><body><p>Yeah, I can't recall why I missed seeing Sky Captain in the theaters when it first came out, and after waiting to rent it, I can safely say I made the right decision.  As Sky Captain began, I had the distinct feeling I had walked into the movie 10 minutes after it had already started.  The Director wastes no time whatsoever in explaining absolutely anything regarding the plot, what year it is and most importantly, why nobody seems to question the sudden, unexpected arrival of Super Gigantic flying robots in New York.<br /><br />While this bothered me on the outside, I was completely amazed at how visually stunning the movie was.  I was upset that any kind of set-up had been totally ignored, but I was also intrigued by what I was seeing.  There was plenty in the way of special effects, and I can see they spent more on them than they did plot development -- or even description OF the plot in general.  Why does the Sky Captain's genius inventor have access to what looks to be a ray gun?  How is it the plane he flies also has the ability to turn into a submarine as well?  Sure, I realize to accept certain movies with a fantasy/sci-fi element to it you must suspend your belief -- but usually SOME kind of explanation is given or is already apparent at the film opening.  Not here.  My questions is WHY?  It could have made the movie much more interesting and quite a bit more entertaining.  Are we dealing with an alternate past where science has grown by leaps and bounds but the rest of the world is trapped in 1939?  I wish I had the answers to these questions, but I don't.<br /><br />When all is said and done, IF I had known about some of the films problems before starting it, I honestly believe I would have enjoyed it more.  In fact, I believe I would recommend the movie for sci-fi buffs, along with a pre-explanation of a few things first.  As for the visuals in the film, they were first rate.  The cinematographer captured the essence of the late 30's and early 40's with perfect accuracy -- at least they did in MY eyes...however, the plot and so many unexplained details made an otherwise enjoyable experience fall slightly flat.</p></body></html>

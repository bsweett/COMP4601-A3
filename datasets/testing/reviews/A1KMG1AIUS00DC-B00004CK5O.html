<meta name="summary" content="Orson Welles, Vienna & a Cool Zither Score"></head><body><p>It's heartening to see that more and more classic films are being released in the Blu-ray format, which offers a crisp, sharp, High Definition picture and greater clarity of sound.  The latest is "The Third Man,"  the 1949 film about post-World War II intrigue set in a Vienna divided into French, American, British, and Russian zones, each containing its share of suspicious characters.<br /> Alcoholic pulp Western author Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) has come to Vienna at the invitation of his friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), who has offered him a job, but Holly arrives just as Lime is being buried.  The film is based on the question, "Who killed Harry Lime?"  We hear contrasting opinions of Lime.  A British officer, Calloway (Trevor Howard), states unequivocally that Lime was a black market profiteer and deserves to be dead.  Lime's girlfriend (Alida Valli) tells Holly that Lime is not the man Calloway has described and sets out to clear his name.<br /> "The Third Man" was made by a team who experienced firsthand the war-torn devastation of Europe.  Director Carol Reed worked for the British Army's wartime documentary unit and writer Graham Greene not only wrote about spies but sometimes was one.  Reed filmed entirely on location in a Vienna still strewn with rubble and bomb craters four years after the war ended.<br /> One of the film's most memorable features is its all-zither score by the Austrian Anton Karas.  In fact, "The Third Man Theme" became one of the biggest hits of 1950.  The music is certainly unique in the annals of film scoring and gives the film both an upbeat feel and an old world quality.  In addition, the movie features a beautifully staged chase sequence that leads to the city's sewer system.  The photography by Robert Krasker in this sequence is especially impressive, as long shots with bright light sources just out of sight throw elongated, distorted shadows, a characteristic of film noir.<br /> The Blu-ray edition contains a restored high-definition digital transfer; a video introduction by writer-director Peter Bogdanovich; two audio commentaries; a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film; "Graham Greene: The Hunted Man," a 1968 episode of the BBC's "Omnibus" series; a 1951 episode of the radio series "The Lives of Harry Lime" written and performed by Orson Welles; archival footage of postwar Vienna; and a booklet featuring an essay on the movie and its impact.</p></body></html>

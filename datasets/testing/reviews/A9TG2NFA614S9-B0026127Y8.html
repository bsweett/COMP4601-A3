<meta name="summary" content="Neeson Becomes Superman"></head><body><p>"Taken" defies the viewer's credulity as Liam Neeson dispatches scores of the Albanian Mafia in the quest for his kidnapped daughter. He's a tech-savvy, hand-to-hand fighting expert trained in security work by the U.S. government. It's a violent movie with some vicious, gory moments. If some U.S. security experts operate the way this guy does, we are in deep trouble.<br /> The movie is well-made, well-acted, and it grabbed me because I'm a sucker for clever detection and suspenseful plots. The motivation behind this kidnapping plot is far-fetched, but don't let that stop you. The car chase scenes are well-executed even if they are incredible. The movie's beginning will get your attention. Early on there's an exciting scene with Liam saving a pop singer from harm as a part-time security man.<br /> At times Neeson seems to have super-human powers, a super-hero impervious to bullets. Why are the bad guys after firing off fusillades of firepower unable to hit their target? Bad aim? Neeson's car is riddled with countless bullet holes, yet he emerges unscathed. He's Superman without the tights.<br /> I think you'll get carried along even though it's hectic, bloody and kind of goofy. The Paris background is absorbing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor who draws you into the plot.</p></body></html>

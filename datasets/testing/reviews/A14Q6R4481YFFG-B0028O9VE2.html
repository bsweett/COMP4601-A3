<meta name="summary" content="More than just a chick flick"></head><body><p>Many of the other reviews obsess over some of the film's minor flaws, like the writing out of the Clasky's son and the sotto voce guilt trip that Brooks is playing on American audiences.  Content yourselves with this folks: he could've ruined the race-and-class issues inherent in a film like this, the way "Grand Canyon" and "Crash" butchered race issues and "Maid in Manhattan" butchered class/ethnic issues.<br /><br />That said: great acting, great morality play.<br /><br />Acting. Shelbie Bruce as Cristina Moreno stole the show.  The simultaneous translation provided in the confrontation between Flor Morenoa and John Clasky is a classic.  Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler, and known quantity whether you like him or not.  I like him.  Tea Leoni: loved her every since the short-lived Fox sitcom "Flying Blind."  I guess that dates me.  She gives 110% and plays her role at 110%, just below the caricature of an Anglo housewife-overachiever.  Sarah Steele was very good as well.<br /><br />Morality play.  Any film whose moral basis is strength in the face of adversity is OK by me, and very refreshing.  The film makes this point time and time again: the flight to Mexico, Flor's decision to devote time to Cristina, returning money for fear of its corrupting influence, non-consummation of a desired relationship because of marriage commitment.  All these themes are worked in to Spanglish with wit and grace.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A classic antiestablishment tale"></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson was born to play this role, a rebel incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital who realizes he won't get out at the end of his 'jail sentence' because he was committed, i.e., he didn't enter voluntarily - so he's stuck there until the high mucky-mucks determine that he's "cured." Nicholson is not the kind of guy to play by the rules, not even to get out of this place, and the more he acts out against the cold attitude of the authorities (Nurse Ratched, in particular, whose name has become synonymous with cruel and implacable persons in authority), the more his fate is sealed.<br />This fantastic movie, which swept the 1976 Oscars in every main category, is based on Milos Forman's book of the same name. Like the book, the film is filled with memorable characters, and it's hard to believe that they're even acting. In many places, the movie takes on the feel of a documentary; it's that realistic and well-acted.<br />An iconic and classic movie that will last forever. Its themes are timeless and universal: one man's reaction (with courage, pride, stubbornness, and sacrifice) to a repressive institution .<br />Marvelous. Ten stars.</p></body></html>

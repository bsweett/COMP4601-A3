<meta name="summary" content="Nick Cage is in his element as prescient stage magician whose ablitites are exposed by a selfless act"></head><body><p>I am a big Nick Cage fan.  And where better to enjoy him as an actor than in a film which he plays an eccentric character with otherworldly abilities?  To be more specific, Cage is cast in the role of a Vegas stage magician with a peculiar power: a gift that allows him to see a couple minutes into the future.  Sadly, or fortunately, depending on your point of view, Cage's character is not able to limit his options to enhancing his magic act.  By stepping in as a good Samaritan, however, his abilities are brought to the attention of federal authorities, who naturally seek to use them to enhance national security--a good example of the old adage "no good deed goes unpunished."  Julianne Moore plays the determined federal agent seeking to enlist him in her cause--whether he likes it or not!  At the same time, the life of Cage's magician is further complicated by the realization that a pretty girl he spots at a diner (played appealingly by Jessica Biel) seems to serve as a focus for his powers that may enable him to see much father into the future!</p></body></html>

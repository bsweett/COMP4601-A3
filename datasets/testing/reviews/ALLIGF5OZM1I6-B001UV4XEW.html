But it's the unique and vivid style in which it's delivered to us, that makes The Hangover not only the funniest comedy of 2009, but also the best comedy of the last few years.<br /><br />Going in, I expected it to be exactly what it could have very easily been: the movie described in the previous paragraph. However, we don't even see the bachelor party.<br /><br />The film opens with Phil (Bradley Cooper) and his two pals on the side of the road in the desert. Between them they have a busted lip, a missing tooth, a hospital bracelet and filthy clothes. Phil makes a dreadful phone call informing a would-be bride, that they are unable to locate her groom. When she reminds him that they are to be married in a few short hours, he apathetically replies, "Yeah... that's not gonna happen."<br /><br />We jump back to before they left for Vegas and meet the characters. Phil is a school teacher who sees nothing wrong with lying to the kids about a made-up field trip, and using the money they hand over, to fund the bachelor party. Stu (Ed Helms) is a dentist who calls himself a doctor, and has his entire life ran for him by his moody and severely overly strict girlfriend. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is beyond strange and is only invited to come along as a favor to the bride, as he is her brother. And we meet Doug (the groom), played by Justin Bartha.<br /><br />We follow them on the road to Vegas, where they check into an insanely expensive room and everything seems to be going a-ok. Then they toast to the first drink and... wake up the next day, seriously hung-over and used and abused by God knows what happened. When Stu asks "Why can't we remember anything from last night?"; Phil delivers one of my favorite lines in the film by responding, "Obviously because we had a great f***ing time."<br /><br />The room is absolutely destroyed; a bowling ball stuck in the middle of the wall, a tiger in the bathroom, and a chicken walking around aimlessly. Oh, and did I mention the infant they find in the closet? And of course, Doug is no-where to be found.<br /><br />From there they begin to use what little clues they have, to help point them in the right direction as to where Doug might be. It's wildly entertaining and devilishly funny. The movie never misses a laugh or skips a beat. Having recently seen The Hangover for a second time; I can tell you it only gets funnier with additional viewings.<br /><br />The amazing Todd Phillips directs this comedic masterpiece as brilliantly as he has done with his treasures of the past, to include: Road Trip, Old School, Starsky & Hutch and School for Scoundrels. There is an excellent soundtrack, and the cinematography is top-notch, to boot.<br /><br />The film is dirty at times but it is never tasteless or witless. It's beautifully and cleverly written and contains at least a dozen one-liners that will live on forever. It may have several clich&eacute; elements found in numerous similar films of this genre, but it does marvelous things with them.<br /><br />For instance: the scene where Doug is given the keys to his future father-in-law's prized car, to take to Vegas. You know it's gonna be all smashed to hell or blown up by the end of the movie, but what they do with it here was genius. Or how about the fact that Stu lied to his insane girlfriend about going to Vegas. Think she might find out? Who cares - everything ties together all the way from the first act to the third, and we appreciate the effort the writers put forth. If they are half as talented at writing action / sci-fi as they are at comedy, Michael Bay should hire them for the third Transformers film.<br /><br />The casting was perfected to a T. Everyone nails their character dead-on. Bradley Cooper is sincere as a guy who just wants to have a good time and can keep his cool when things don't go as planned. Ed Helms makes an excellent worrier when nothing goes as planned. And Zach Galifianakis was born to be the guy to cause everything to not go as planned.<br /><br />The Hangover will undoubtedly do for Galifianakis' career, what Tommy Boy did for Chris Farley. The man is already practically a comedic icon. He plays Alan exactly as Stu describes Alan's character, "Don't let the beard fool you. He's a child." Alan doesn't swear, he goes out for a night of partying in Vegas wearing a T-shirt with a painting of a wolf and he explains to the guys he won't be able to hang with them when they get back, because the Jonas brothers will be in town. We believe that Alan would behave the way he does and say the strange and sometimes moronic things he does, in every scene. Perhaps the best example of this would be when Stu tells him that his grandmother's holocaust ring is missing and Alan replies, "I didn't know they gave out rings at the holocaust."<br /><br />That's just one of many, folks. See it. After all, The Hangover has made cinematic history by becoming the highest grossing R-Rated comedy of all time.</p></body></html>

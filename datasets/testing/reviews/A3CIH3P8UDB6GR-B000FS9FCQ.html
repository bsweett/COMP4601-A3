<meta name="summary" content="Disappointed but had its Bright moments!!"></head><body><p>First of all, I thought it was kind of cheesy and how it was just not much as what I expected.  I will say at the end with all the masks. "cool part!"  Although, i will buy it in HD DVD format but I think it's a movie that will grow on you if watched more than once. . . or twice. . . for that reason I just think that it felt like Zorro meets Revolutionist meets Batman Gotham City.  It had its moment but I thought the Natalie Portman character was kind of stupid, and I like Natalie. . . but oh well......  Should Rent it and atleast give this movie a try.  I'm buying it lol with just 3 stars but thats because i'm builting an HD DVD Collections and think this movie would look great!!! But if i hated the movie lol . . . forget HD lol rather buy Muppet Show HD DVD than this, but it wasn't BAD!!!</p></body></html>

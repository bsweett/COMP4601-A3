Sure you have choices but the choices are brought about with one purpose in mind and surrounding events cause you to make the only plausible decision.<br /><br />Lady in the Water offers a classic tale about a battle between good and evil. A group of close-knit tenants whose purpose in life comes down to a single moment in time where they can work with one another to bring two worlds long separated, together. Their one purpose, to protect the lady in the water.<br /><br />The lady in the water is a waiflike nymph who inspires writers to write, men to be brave and love to bloom. Her mission is to be the bridge between the land and water dwellers with the hope of opening the lines of communication that have been broken for centuries.<br /><br />As can be expected from M. Night Shyamalan, there are lots of twists and turns as you try to decipher each character's role. The film is sublimely shot and truly suspenseful, counting on the viewer's mind to increase the intensity instead of over the top blood and guts.<br /><br />I was expecting to learn more behind the scenes secrets in the special features but still highly recommend.</p></body></html>

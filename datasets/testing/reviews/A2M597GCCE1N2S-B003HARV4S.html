<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant movie, wonderful ending!"></head><body><p>I must admit I had no idea what to expect when I watched this movie, but when it was over I was very impressed with what I saw. This is one movie that will make you question just what is really a trick, and what has happened in the story itself.<br /><br />The Illusionist tells the story about a young man simply named Eisenheim [Edward Norton] who leaves audiences of his shows in total amazement and awe at his spellbinding tricks and illusions in many shows in Vienna. His shows are so well acclaimed that he sparks the interest of the crown prince, Leopold [Rufus Sewell] and his fiance. [Jessica Biel]<br /><br />At first the crown prince believes that Eisenhiem is no threat, but after his fiance and Eisenheim realize that they were once childhood friends [maybe even more] Leopold believes his marriage is in danger. Paul Giamatti costars as the city's chief inspector who at first believes Eisenheim is a great magician who is there just to entertain, but starts to question his own judgement on the magician, especially after a terrible crime is committed and he has to judge between what the facts are and what he truly believes is the truth.<br /><br />This is a dark film through most of the 109 minutes of this film, in more ways than one. Not only do the characters talk in hushed and toned down voices through most of this movie, but a lot of the magic acts take place in a darkly lit theater, with candlelight and hushed voices adding to the dramatic effect of one of Eisenheim's acts. There are also a few clues to the past of Eisenheim as a boy, which are just as interesting and curious as one of his fantastic acts, such as how he really became a magician in the first place.<br /><br />As for the ending, I will not give it away, but I will say I was absolutely caught off guard with how it ended. Perhaps you will be able to see what I did not, but maybe thats because i absolutely suck at predicting endings of movies, its a big weakness for me!<br /><br />There are also a couple of reviews below mine that rip into this movie and how the characters cannot act with one another...I disagree with that 100%. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are great as always, I dont think there is anyone who can deny Norton as a great actor [just look at Fight Club and American History X] as for Paul Giamatti, Cinderella Man anyone? Jessica Biel also passes with her performance, and Leopold was good too, although I found his outbursts of anger a little laughable [just my opinion]<br /><br />Extras on this DVD include:<br /><br />Feature Audio Commentary by the director Neil Burger<br /><br />The Making of the Illusionist<br /><br />and a segment with Jessica Biel who talks about the movie herself.<br /><br />This is a great movie to see at least once, it has drama, even humor, a great cast of actors and actresses, and an ending that will show you as it says on the DVD cover...Nothing is what it seems.</p></body></html>

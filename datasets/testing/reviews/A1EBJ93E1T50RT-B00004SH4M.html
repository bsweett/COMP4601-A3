"Goldfinger" represents the artistic nirvana of the James Bond series, before Connery lost interest in the role, when his powers as 007 were at their greatest.<p>"Goldfinger" has an interesting two-part plot structure in which Auric Goldfinger is not actually revealed to be a mega-villain until the second half.  The first 55 minutes involve luscious locales, a couple of shocking death sequences (most notably Tilly Masterson's death by hat mere minutes after her entry into the film), and the funniest golf game in history (until the advent of Tony Soprano).  Once the scene shifts to Kentucky, and Goldfinger's plan is revealed, Bond has little to do except lounge around in polo shirts or say things like "He blew a fuse".  Thanks to the new DVD box set, even 40 years later it's instantly understandable why half the world's men want to be Sean Connery.<p>The special edition DVD is one of the best in the series.  Unlike "Dr. No" and "From Russia...", there are two audio commentary tracks.  The first, produced years ago for the laserdisc, features edited sound bites from director Guy Hamilton and other cast members.  The second, made for the DVD, has clips only from crewmembers (beware the misleading print on the back cover), and thus there's plenty of time for Bond expert John Cork to make some interesting scholarly points about how dated the Ian Fleming novels are, and what elements of Bonds character did not survive the 1970s.  Indeed from this track you learn a lot more about the original "Goldfinger" novel, and you'll hear opinions as to why the story works better as a movie.  These are worthy points and they set the commentary track above the cut-and-paste variety.<p>The two "documentaries" are also above-average.  The making-of feature, narrated by Patrick Macnee, features the fall-off-the-couch laughing screen test of Theodore Bikel as Goldfinger... evidently playing the role as a college professor!  The second feature is all about the marketing of "Goldfinger".  There are some awesome finds in here, such as the picture of a fat Prince Charles riding in a toy Aston Martin DB-5, or the Vicks commercial featuring Harold Sakata demolishing an American suburb with his persistent cough.  There's also a truly dreadful 1964 US promotional film, with grainy black-and-white footage from the movie and the snarkiest voice-over ever.  "Looks like he passed the audition."<p>And the real great moment here is Connery's well-timed 1964 jab at the Beatles.  Final proof that the Bond movies are, in fact, still as relevant as ever.</p></body></html>

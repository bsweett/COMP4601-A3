<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Thriller!!!"></head><body><p>This is a really good action/suspense film! the Government thinks a big terrorist deal is going down in another country, so the Government wipes them out, because they can do whatever they want without caring. But they're wasn't a deal going down, everyone was innocent. Then we meet Jerry Shaw with his problems. He comes home and a whole bunch of illegal guns and passports are in his room, then he gets a call from a woman. The woman tells him to leave before the police arrive. He is captured and interrogated by Billy Bob Thornton, who plays Tom Morgan. Jerry gets another call and he escapes. Meanwhile, we meet Rachel Holloman, who soon joins Jerry in the deadly game. If she doesn't do what she is told, her son will die. Throughout the movie, Jerry and Rachel are forced to evade the police and steal things. They find out that they are being forced by a super computer. Rachel's son is going to play music for the President, and he doesn't know that there is a deadly crystal in his instrument. Jerry and Rachel must stop it from happening by all means necessary. Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton, and Michael Chiklis all did an awesome job! If you love suspense and action, you'll love EAGLE EYE!!!<br /><br />p.s. Happy New Year!!!</p></body></html>

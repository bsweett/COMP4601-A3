<meta name="summary" content="Two Weeks in Bruges"></head><body><p>Quite frankly, In Bruges is a well done film. It took me a little while to process it, but it really does leave an impact. I had to rewatch it a couple of times as well, just to fully grasp it and appreciate its subtlety. The acting is phenominal. Colin Farrell was surprisingly great. He has never made me laugh much at all, but he was pretty funny in this film. Brendan Gleeson was phenominal as always. He may just be my favorite actor that isn't a household name. A few years ago, prior to seeing this and then going on to recognizing him in many more films afterwards, I only knew him as that weird professor from The Order of the Phoenix. But he has certainly moved up my list with each subsequent film I see him in. Ralph Fiennes had a fairly short amount of screen time, but he made the most of it. Very menacing, and dare I say ordinary villain. Not to mention, he delivered the film's absolute best line. Without going into detail, it's about inanimate objects.<br /><br />The performances absolutely make this movie, but there are many other good feats to mention. The script was very well written. It's not exactly a laugh out loud comedy, but there are some tongue in cheek moments that made me pause, smile, then after processing what I had heard, or seen, bust out with laughter. This is dark comedy at its best. It really is funny. That doesn't take away from the dramatic elements at all though. It does get very dramatic. The worst part is that you don't even expect to get hit with an emotional scene directly after a funny one. It's a great combination. I did like it a lot, but it's not something I'd recommend for everyone. I'm not sure if I'd call it polarizing, but it's the definition of "see it for yourself, and you be the judge." Obviously, there are better dark comedies out there. This movie actually has a bit of a Coen Brother feel to it, which is always a major compliment, at least to me. In fact, quite a few of their films are the better dark comedies I was referring to.<br /><br />I had a little trouble getting past some of the music choices. I think the composer and music supervisor could have done better jobs. That said, I got past the music pretty quickly once the characters and story itself sucked me in. I also think there are definitely questionable moments. Therefore, a little suspension of disbelief is required. In other words, you can't be one of those nitpicking people who know how to ruin the experience and immersion. Despite my complaints, the good very much outweighs the bad. There are plenty of redeeming qualities. I think this is still a movie that everyone should see. It's well worth the time, and money (if you have to spend it). I highly recommend In Bruges.</p></body></html>

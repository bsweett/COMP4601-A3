Macy) hit the road in a bid to recapture the free-spirited glory of their untroubled youth.  While en route from Ohio to California, the group does battle with a leather-clad motorcycle gang (headed by Ray Liotta) that regularly terrorizes the small Midwestern town through which the boys are passing.<br /><br />Though the credits state that the screenplay was written by one Brad Copeland, we suspect that it might actually be the product of a precocious seventh-grader banging away on his personal computer while feeling his first stirrings of puberty.  That might account for why every single joke seems to have originated in a junior high school locker room.  With its nonstop gay-bashing and rituals of male-bonding, it's often hard to tell whether the movie is actually more homophobic or homoerotic in nature.  Add to this an overabundance of genuinely uninspired slapstick routines as well as a raft of midlife crisis cliches, and you have one of the worst least-common-denominator comedies to come our way in a long time.</p></body></html>

But I've never read the comics, never seen the old movies, never watched Lois and Clark or Smallville... my life was devoid of the man of steel. Now that I've been exposed to his world, I'm addicted. I thought nothing could be better than Spider-man and Batman, what other superheroes do you need when you have Spidey and the caped crusader?? I had no idea how complex the character of Superman actually was, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I could, indeed, become crazily obsessed with another superhero.<br /><br />Superman Returns stars the amazing Brandon Routh as Superman/Clark Kent. Superman is back after having been gone for five years. He's lucky to get his old job at the Daily Planet back, where Jimmy happily greets him and gets him up to speed on everything he's missed, particularly the life of Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth)-- Superman's man squeeze who has since moved on. She even has a son and a permanent fiancee to prove it. But she really hasn't moved on; she's completely hung up on Superman, of course! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is planning to use crystals and kryptonite in his next scheme, hoping to kill Superman and create a new continent that will belong solely to, who else, himself.<br /><br />There's lots going on in this movie, as if the filmmakers were trying to make up for lost time in the Superman franchise. It loses points there. And the mis-use of Lane's child also loses points. The kid could've been an excellent plot device, as well as an engaging character, but he does little but sit and stare and look kinda creepy. But it's still a great movie. Full of action and romance and tortured souls.<br /><br />Routh is practically the poster boy of All-American goodness-- his bright smile and eyes, that perfectly coifed hair, that manly physique. He plays the role of Superman with just enough torture, just enough charisma, just enough cheesiness, that it works to perfection. Bosworth should've played the role of Lois with a bit more spunk. I love Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He's menacing and cold, but idiotic and funny. And Lex's girl Kitty (Parker Posey) is just plain hilarious, delivering the movies more lighter and funnier moments just when you need them.<br /><br />Awesome summer fare. Awesome anytime fare. One of the best superhero movies I've ever seen! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

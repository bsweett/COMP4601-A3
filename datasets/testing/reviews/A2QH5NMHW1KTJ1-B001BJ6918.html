<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first"></head><body><p>I could hardly wait to see kill bill, luckily I got tickets for the first screening. It is amazing. It really is better than the first. Lest bloodier, but still a triumph. It is the last volume of the kill bill saga. <p>Volume 2 takes place where volume 1 left off. After the killing off Vernita Green (Vivica Fox), the bride (Uma Thurman) is looking for number 3 on her list, "Budd"(Michael Madson) she finds herself on Buds trailer in the middle of the desert. Budd is warned by Bill (David Carradine) that she is coming, the bride then simply realizes she has to go through Budd and Elle to go to Bill. Then as you would remember in the end of volume 1 Bill gives a message that her daughter is still a live, then the bride suddenly realizes her daughter is still alive. Quentin Tarantino delivers an astonishing film. This volume I like better than volume 1, but that's me. <p>In this film you see the training the bride had to go through. And in this volume they reveal the brides name. In the first volume it takes place in Japan, in this film it's a mixture of China, Mexico, and America. This film has some scenes that are really hard to look at like volume 1. There was this one particular scene I looked away, when you watch this film, I'm pretty sure you can guess what scene. This is a definitely must see film especially if you loved the first.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superbly acted and directed action/adventure classic"></head><body><p>"Jaws" is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film. It's not really a horror film although it contains horror elements. Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters played by Robert Shaw (old sea dog), Roy Scheider (local police chief), and Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme - this is a film classic. Don't bother with any of the sequels.</p></body></html>

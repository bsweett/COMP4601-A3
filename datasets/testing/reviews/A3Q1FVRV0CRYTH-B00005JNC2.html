My wife hated this movie because it was slow and at times seemingly meaningless but in the end I was floored at how much I enjoyed the normalicy of a plot revolving around real life and the fact that there was nothing remotly fictinal about the charactors.  These people could be my neighbors and I liked that about the film.  Andrew (Braff) is an actor hopped up on meds his shrink father prescribed for him.  His mother just died and so he's back homefor the first time in 9 years for the funeral.  WHile he's in town he hangs out with friends (Sasgard) and Sam (Portman in an amazing role for her!)  The movie is just that...4 days of Andrew being home, off meds and away from the pressures of playing a retard on TV (literally)...anyways...I thought that it was a great, coming of age film and is worth a watch by anyone interested in exploring the reality that is life, no matter how boring you find yours to be.</p></body></html>

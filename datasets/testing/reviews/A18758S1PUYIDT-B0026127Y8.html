<meta name="summary" content="Stars for Neeson and Grace"></head><body><p>The stars are for Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace, but not so much for the film.  It's a standard action/international thriller--nothing that has not been done a thousand times before.  Shooting an innocent woman in the arm to make her husband talk does not make me admire the so-called hero in the story, and neither does his leaving a man to be electrocuted repeatedly until the power eventually goes off.  Yes, I get that he is trying to rescue his daughter, but if it were so easy, there wouldn't be so many women still hidden away, as they are right now.<br />There's also no indication that he was going to notify the French police or Interpol about all the captive women he saw.  Sure, they could be moved, but at least there would have been some leads and perhaps DNA left behind.</p></body></html>

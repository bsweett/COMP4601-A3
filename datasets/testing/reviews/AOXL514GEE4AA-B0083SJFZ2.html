<meta name="summary" content=""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!" Blu-ray Review!"></head><body><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you Sam Worthington! The next great action hero...who can act! I mentioned in my Terminator Salvation review that there was something special about this guy and this remake of Clash of the Titans should solidify that! This is saying a lot considering how short on character development this film is. Imagine if a lousy actor played Perseus? This would've been a complete bomb.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans is an adrenaline rush! Fans of the original should love this. It follows the myth of Perseus and the Gods of Olympus with some new twists along the way. The short of it is simple. Perseus (Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Neeson)and as the last remaining demi-god the city of Argos looks to him to save them. Feuled with rage against Hades (Fiennes) for killing his earthly adopted parents, Perseus takes up the quest to stop the revenge of the gods. The task, capture the head of Medusa, kill the Kraken and send Hades back to the underworld! Sounds like fun? It is! A complete romp and action fest.<br /><br />The movie does fail on one level, and it is an important one: character development. The storyline is wonderful and the great actors in this film do much with little. If only they would have spent 15 extra minutes on the band of soldiers and the royal family of Argos, we might have found a little more emotional investment. You just don't care when people start dying and that is never good.<br /><br />All in all, this movie still packs a wallop and is totally enjoyable! Even with it's flaws, this movie is pure entertainment and a wonderful remake of a classic!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Clash of the Titans was made for BLU! This movie gets 5 brilliant stars for video and audio! SPECIAL FEATURES: Wonderful and copius. Check out the deleted scenes and alternate ending only found on BD. You will appreciate the ending they chose even more. FINAL THOUGHTS: A DEMO DISC, OWN IT, SHOW YOUR FRIENDS!</p></body></html>

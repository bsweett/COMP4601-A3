<meta name="summary" content="Moore Please"></head><body><p>I personally would not call myself a HUGE Michael Moore fan, - which is rare seeing that people seem to either completely despise the man OR totally idolize him. I am not biased what so ever ... and I believe that his previous films tended to try to bash you over the head with the same topics over and over again until you found yourself walking out of the theater with a bit of a headache. Don't get me wrong though, - at times - they can prove to be thought provoking Documentaries with just the right touch of satire.<br /><br />In my eyes Mr. Moore is alot like Rolling Stone magazine - the way that he is SO liberal and SO against the direction the Country is headed. Yet I still seem to find myself with a Subscription to Rolling Stone and a Opening Day Ticket for ANY of his films.<br /><br />The bottom line is that he is a gifted Director with ALOT of built up feelings that is .... interesting ... to see unfold unto a screen. Even though he does get a bit carried away ...<br /><br />All that being said - I think I enjoyed "Sicko" more than his previous two films ... ahhh heck ... I liked them as well.<br /><br />Is it to much to ask for Fourths?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Every Little Thing Is Gonna Be Alright"></head><body><p>Back in 1954, Richard Matheson wrote a 'Legendary' novel that inspired many authors and film makers. Stephen King often gives partial credit to Matheson for his categorical success (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425104338">Stephen King's Danse Macabre</a>). Three film adaptations have been made of this "Legendary" novel. None of the three have ever done the novel true justice. But the most recent adaptation of Matheson's novel called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">I Am Legend</a> is perhaps the best movie of 2007.<br /><br />It's no secret that 2007's I Am Legend centers around the exploits of Will Smith playing the last man on Earth. And Smith is absolutely phenomenal as this modern day (2009 - 2012) survivor; he deserves an award for his portrayal as Dr. Robert Neville. The movie runs for 101 minutes and Smith occupies the screen pretty much solo for about 3-quarters of the movie...but rest assured...he's not alone.<br /><br />Fans of Matheson's novel should go into Director Francis Lawrence's 2007 film adaptation with an open mind. The key word is that this is an 'adaptation' inspired by the original novel. In fact, 2007's I Am Legend seems to not only be inspired by the novel, but also by the two prior film adaptations (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>; the 2007 film has elements of all three as well as some very cool original aspects.<br /><br />Lawrence does an excellent job at keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with taught suspense. Smith keeps you captivated from start to finish. The story is terrific. The action scenes are very well done. But the superhuman abilities of the 'night seekers' is a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I look forward to the DVD release of I Am Legend, because I will certainly add it to my cart.<br /><br />DVD RELEASE UPDATE - 3-20-2008 -- The DVD release of I Am Legend includes an alternate ending option to the theatrical release. Watch it. It is dubbed the "controversal ending", but it is actually more true to the theme of the original idea created by Matheson that the title of the story is derived from. Is Nevelle (Smith) a "Legend" for his work in science or is he a Legendary monster among the world's new society?</p></body></html>

Though I personally enjoyed `Insurrection', many hardcore fans despised the movie, citing it as being too romantic and humorous and way too light on the action.  So, with that response to their previous installment, Paramount wanted to make the next movie be much darker, more action-packed, and featuring an even more intense storyline than previous films.  For the previous two films, Paramount was happy with actor Jonathan Frakes filling the role of director as well, especially with his extremely entertaining and successful effort with "Star Trek:  First Contact", but with the somewhat lesser performance of "Star Trek:  Insurrection", the executives at Paramount felt it would be safer to go with a fresh perspective to direct the newest film.  Enter renowned film editor Stuart Baird, whose talent for finding the perfect blend of action and drama has served him well throughout his career in film, and Paramount felt it was time to give this long-time editor the chance to put his skills directly behind the camera.  Would this choice prove to be a wise one, or merely another nail in the coffin for this slowly dwindling franchise, only time would tell.<br /><br />"Star Trek:  Nemesis" begins on a joyous note, with the wedding of Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis).  On this wonderful day even more good news arrives when Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives word that the Romulans want peace, and that the crew of the Enterprise-E are to be the emissaries of the Federation.  Just as the Enterprise makes its way towards the Romulan Empire, a brilliant villain named Shinzon awaits them, harboring an evil plan of destruction for the Federation, and a dark secret linking him and Picard.<br /><br />Prior to the release of this 10th film in the long-running `Star Trek' movie franchise, I felt that "Star Trek:  First Contact" was probably the best `Star Trek' movie made; however, after viewing "Star Trek:  Nemesis", I believe a new best of `Trek' movie has been named.  The hardcore fans of the franchise, or `Trekkies' as they prefer to be called, who were less than thrilled with `Insurrection', were without a doubt unbelievably impressed with `Nemesis'.  Even though "Star Trek:  Nemesis" was by far one of the best `Star Trek' films ever made, it sadly didn't do too well at the box office.  This was caused by the poor reception to "Star Trek:  Insurrection" and that the current TV series "Star Trek:  Enterprise" was receiving poor ratings, so support for the franchise was at an all-time low.  I also believe a big problem the `Star Trek' franchise faced, and the result was evident for this movie, was that the market had been oversaturated with the series, because pretty much for the last 20 to 30 years there has always been some form of `Star Trek' that could be seen either on TV or in theaters.  Perhaps, if more time had gone by between the release of `Insurrection' and the release of `Nemesis', the latter would have fared better at the box office, but now we'll never know for sure.<br /><br />The acting, as always in these movies, was top-notch due to the cast being so familiar with their characters that they all are second nature to them.  The director, Stuart Baird, a newcomer to the `Star Trek' franchise, did an excellent job helming this film, and delivered a high-octane thrill ride that delivered on so many levels.  All of the special effects in the movie were outstanding, and by far the best in the entire series, which added to the overall greatness of this movie.  Without a doubt, this movie should have done much better at the box office, and it's a shame it didn't because it truly is the best in the series, and is one `Star Trek' film that should not be missed!<br /><br />"Star Trek:  Nemesis" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief sensuality.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Take a Chance On Dot, Dot, Dot"></head><body><p>While my two-year old great nephew was derailing a runaway Lionel train around the Christmas tree and had totally wrecked a ranch-style plastic home, my other great nephews and great niece were exhorting me to open the presents they brought me. Knowing I had seen the play on Broadway three times and once in Toronto, it was no surprise that "Momma Mia," the DVD was behind the decorative Christmas paper. "Oh, can we watch it, Uncle Ed?" (If ever a gift could keep on giving right back to the givers)!<br /><br />Even though Meryl Streep is old enough to be a grandmother (and probably is), the camera never gets too close to her face, as she plays a barely middle-aged mother of a love-struck daughter on the verge of marriage. The daughter discovers that Mom was a bit wilder in her youth having made love to three men at approximately the same time. The plot unfolds when she decides to invite her "fathers" to the wedding without her mother's knowledge. MOMMA MIA!<br /><br />This is loosely based on a late 60's movie titled "Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell," where the twist is that Gina Lollabrigitta tells three American World War II veterans that they are the father of her son. Their guilt and money provide for the same. Only here, the setting is an unnamed Greek isle instead of Italy, and mom is barely scraping by running what can be charitably called an inn.<br /><br />An unabashed ABBA fan, I enjoy each hit over and over again, and could play them all day. I play them when I am in a good mood, and when I need to get in a good mood. The music from this can be found on the CD for the movie (d'uh), or ABBA Gold, which has every one but, "I do."<br /><br />So, love me or leave me, but please don't deceive me, because I won't deceive you. Meryl Streep reveals her absolute depth in her performance. Her ending with her co-stars is a triumph of harmony on stage or at Waterloo where Napoleon did surrender. Pierce Brosnan's bellowing efforts might make you want to suck on a lemon while someone is running steel fingernails across a blackboard, but the movie is fun even in a rich man's world, or for a super trouper. The supporting cast was superb. I was particularly impressed with Julie Walters who played one of Meryl Streep's adult sidekicks. Christine Baranski was predictably good. I never imagined that Stellan Skaarsgard could kick up a storm the way he did.<br /><br />My gift included a trailer that allowed the viewer to see the making of the movie, and the songs being replayed in the movie with the words appearing, but without the bouncing ball. It helped me learn a lot of the correct words that men seem to have a harder time identifying them than women do when it comes to song. (Up to age 50, I thought Popeye was strong to the "pinach" cuz I eats me spinach).<br /><br />Do I recommend this DVD? I ask in all honesty, without a song or dance what are we? So I say thank you for the music, (and the DVD,) for giving it to me. Just remember there is no comparison between this and what you would see on Broadway, in Toronto or Peoria at Route 24, Junction 8, for that matter. The movie could only leave you disappointed. It is entertaining especially if you are forgiving of Streep and Brosnan not being singers.<br /><br />Thank you, Christian, Gabriella, Samuel Adam, and Emmanuel.<br /><br />Uncle Ed<br /><br />For Barrie Bracken.</p></body></html>

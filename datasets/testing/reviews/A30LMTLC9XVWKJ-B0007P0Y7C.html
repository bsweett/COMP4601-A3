<meta name="summary" content="What a Mess"></head><body><p>Although forewarned, I was not totally prepared for just how staggeringly bad this thing actually was. But in fairness I had to actually see it to believe it, because the suck level is beyond anything I could have imagined. Think about the producers of the second "Charlie's Angels" movie doing a remake of "Enter the Dragon" (with the Angels cast) and you get some idea of "Elektra". Wherever the $40 plus million budget ended up, it was not on the screen.<br /><br />Even from its inception the idea was suspect. Since "Daredevil" occupies pretty much the lowest rung on the superhero ladder, that makes "Electra's" status subterranean; they truly were scraping the bottom of the barrel. Add to this a really lame script (most cartoons have more subtle story lines and better dialog), uninteresting production design, poor lighting, and really bad direction and you can at least figure out why it is so bad.<br /><br />But that leaves the mystery of why a studio, whose goal is to make (not lose) money, ever gave a green-light to the project. In may be that since comic titles like "Elektra" are basically sexploitation, the money people looked at the casting of Jennifer Garner and Natassia Malthe and saw huge sexploitation potential. Unfortunately someone forgot to tell this to the director and the DP because the filming of the two actresses is totally sterile (and they wonder why this thing lost money).<br /><br />The movie's fight scenes suffer from ADD; each shot is a nanosecond long which negates any need for stunt work. choreography, or effects. There's even a showdown sequence where a bunch of laundry fights with the actors. At least this is original although it might have been used once in a "Charlie Chan" movie.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner looks confused most of the time. Like they did a lot of tight shots on her face in the studio and then cut them randomly into action footage produced by the second unit. These reaction shots just make her look totally clueless. I was  surprised by how old she looks, hard to believe she is only 33. She has clearly outgrown this type of role and I felt embarrassed for her.<br /><br />It seems inconceivable that "anyone" would find this entertaining although apparently a few people actually liked it.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.</p></body></html>

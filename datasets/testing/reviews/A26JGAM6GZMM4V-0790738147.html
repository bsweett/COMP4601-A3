<meta name="summary" content="Who isn't corrupt?"></head><body><p>Almost every character in the is film is corrupt. Reasons vary, of course, but there are the usual suspects: money, power, ego, greed, sex, ambition, and fear. This film probably launched Russell Crowe's career in the role of always cynical and sometimes dangerously violent Detective Bud White who has his own concept of justice just as Detective Harry Callahan does. White's partner, Detective Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), is far more calculating and self-serving, willing to advance his career at whatever cost. Detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is their associate and to me, the most interesting character in the film. He maintains a high level of efficiency without ever placing himself in harm's way. He serves as technical advisor to a television series and has a payola deal with Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito): let him know whenever a celebrity is about to be arrested so that Hudgeons can obtain an on-site  photo exclusive for his tabloid, Hush Hush. Meanwhile, having fallen in love with Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) who bears a striking resemblance to Veronica Lake, White learns about a unique prostitution ring whose other members also resemble other film stars. (One awkward scene in the movie suggests that Lana Turner was unaware of the ring.) Separately, White and Exley eventually penetrate more deeply and more dangerously the corruption in Hollywood during the 1950s, corruption which includes the L.A.P.D. And then....<br /><br />This is a classic, in some respects "noir" police film, ably directed by Curtis Hanson. Some have compared it with The Big Sleep, Chinatown, and even Training Day but I think there are more differences than similarities between any them. Basinger received an Academy Award for best supporting actress and Hanson shared an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay (of James Ellroy's brilliant novel) with Brian Helgeland. Years from now, this film may have more historical than dramatic interest but, so far, it has held up well as first-rate entertainment for those such as I who enjoy this genre of film.</p></body></html>

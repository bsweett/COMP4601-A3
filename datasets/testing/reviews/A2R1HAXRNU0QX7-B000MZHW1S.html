<meta name="summary" content="A cumbersome script more than redeemed by great action and special performances!"></head><body><p>BLOOD DIAMOND wants to illustrate the tangled, multi-national, disgraceful state of "Conflict Diamonds"...diamonds that are mined in war-torn countries, where countrymen are randomly killed or thrown in slavery, all over the desire by one warring faction or another to control the diamond trade.  They are supposed to be illegal in most of the world, but the movie reminds us that it's a pretty simple matter of paying a few bribes to the right folks after smuggling the diamonds to a "legal" country.  This is where the movie stumbles the most.  It's political messages are presented in little speeches peppered throughout the film, in a manner that stops the pace of the film.  One need only remember how well THE CONSTANST GARDNER wove similar subject matter into the very fabric of its being.  Take politics out of GARDNER and there'd have been no film left.  Take them out of BLOOD DIAMOND, and you'd have a rip-roaring action movie (and a MUCH smaller role for Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, an amoral diamond smuggler, pretty much willing to kill anyone who stands in his way (he was a mercenary, so knows his way around guns).  Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vendy, a poor fisherman whose path crosses with DiCaprio when Solomon finds a rare, huge "blood diamond" and DiCaprio gets wind of it.  Solomon's son has been kidnapped by brutal rebels, and his only interest is to get his son back.  DiCaprio convinces Solomon he can help, but only agrees to do so if Solomon will lead him to the diamond.<br /><br />Accompanying them on their journey is journalist Jennifer Connelly, who gets to spout much of the political rhetoric of the movie, especially early on.  The three travel through a brutal and violent landscape.  In many ways, the movie is like a Saturday-morning movie serial, moving from one close call to another...but it's all extremely violent.  Lots and lots of women and children callously cut down in the film.  We see children killing and being killed.<br /><br />As I said, I found the political "message" to be less than compelling as drama.  But the drama of the movie...the action, if you will, is well staged and makes up for much of the rest.  Edward Zwick, who did such a great job with GLORY and a pretty good job, I thought, with THE LAST SAMURAI, is clearly aiming for an "important" film here...but in the end it's a violent, gory, terrifying, exciting action film.  I don't mean to dismiss the plight of the people in Africa.  It IS very disturbing to be aware of what's going on...and that's good.  However, as filmmaking, the filmmakers didn't quite work out how to dramatize the message.<br /><br />I would say the script probably failed them.  The editing, cinematography, landscapes and especially the actors and the ACTION are all first-rate.  But the words the actors have to spout are often wince-inducingly non-human.<br /><br />DiCaprio is all the way back now as one of our great actors.  After TITANIC, he briefly fell into the role of hard-partying idiot and somewhat fell out of favor.  He returned to serious filmwork in GANGS OF NEW YORK, but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN was more successful for him, but his acting chops were somewhat dismissed due to the frivolous nature of the film.  THE AVIATOR got him an Oscar nod, but somehow the public didn't really embrace it.  But this year, with THE DEPARTED and BLOOD DIAMOND, there is no doubting anymore that he is an actor of considerable skill.  His spotty South African accent aside (it's one of the toughest accents to replicate...seriously), he is first rate.  He's really a bad guy with charm, and the fact that we feel mostly on his side through the film, even though he's killing people left and right, is a testament to his charm.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly, in a poorly written role, always looks great, and staring with roughly the middle of the film, her character begins to connect with the audience, and we start to like her.  Her final "scene" with DiCaprio would have been cloying in the hands of other performers, but they both pull it off.<br /><br />And Djimon Hounsou is always a mighty presence.  He was great in AMISTAD, Oscar nominated for IN AMERICA, and truly in his element in BLOOD DIAMOND.  He's an African born actor, and in this film he's truly in his element.  He has a real sense of the pace and lifestyle of the region, and it comes across very well.  His role is written to make him a very saintly character, and again, in less able hands, might have been truly one-dimensional.  I wish more people were seeing this film, if only to see him.<br /><br />So, overall I recommend the film.  It's never boring, though occasionally frustrating.  It is NOT for the kids, though. The violence is graphic, constant and inflicted on truly innocent people.  But if you want adult entertainment with lots of action and don't mind a sheen of "message," you'll be pleased.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Astounding Creativity"></head><body><p>What would you do if you were a weapons developer; find out that the weapons you manufacture are used to kill innocents and then learn that you have shrapnel near your heart that could kill you at any moment?<br /><br />If you are anything like Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) you'd build a mechanical suit and fight to end your own weapons. And, to prevent your death, you'd create this little gizmo based on a new energy source to prevent the shrapnel from entering your heart. It's this energy that powers your suit.<br /><br />But of course, the bad guys don't want you to succeed, so they'll build a gigantic robot to stop you.<br /><br />This movie is packed with fabulous actors: Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Howard, and Paul Bettany as the voice for Stark's butler, Jarvis.<br /><br />I think this film is better than the Spider-man movies and just up there with Batman Begins. Everything about it is top-notch: acting, writing, chemistry, etc... Some of the best comedic moments are between Tony Stark and his robot assistance as he builds his updated Iron Man suit.<br /><br />The bottom line for my experience of this movie was creativity. The creativity found in this movie was astounding. Everything is crisp and great looking.<br /><br />This is going to join my DVD collection. Can't wait for the sequel!</p></body></html>

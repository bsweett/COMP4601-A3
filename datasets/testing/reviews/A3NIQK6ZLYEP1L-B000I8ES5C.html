<meta name="summary" content="A manga come to life?"></head><body><p>Kung Fu Hustle has the humor, plot and characters of a silly manga.  Kung Fu fighting, dancing mobsters, silly cartoon style chase scenes and slum lords.  What more could you want?  How about commentary by the director and some of the cast, a behind-the-scenes feature, outtakes and bloopers along with some deleted scenes?  If that isn't enough we get an interview with Stephen Chow himself.  Remember, it is not for kids and the English dubbing sucks, so watch the subtitles.<br /><br />Get it used or new, but do get it.</p></body></html>

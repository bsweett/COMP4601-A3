However, now that I've seen it on DVD a few times, I can honestly say I like it a lot better. It still feels like half a film, the action sequences still seem kind of pointless, and it lacks the punch and innovation of the original - but as long as you're prepared and know where everything is leading and how this chapter in the Matrix saga ends, it all seems to flow and overall work a lot better than it really should. The thought puzzles surrounding &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;free will&quot; are still good for a ponder, even if they haven't been as nicely integrated as the philosphy in the original. It also helps to have seen The Matrix Revolutions, which should really be viewed as one combined film with Reloaded.<p>Normally I give DVDs another star if the extras add value to the overall package, but there's not that much extra stuff here. You get the funny MTV awards spoof and a good documentary on the freeway chase, but everything else feels promotional. There's also something funny about the audio-mixing too; music is cranked up while speech is softer than it should be. Overall it's a competent DVD, but there's supposed to be a much better box set coming soon. As for the movie, it's still flawed but gets better with repeat viewings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Robert Zemeckis, I'll admit is a genius in what he does"></head><body><p>My daughter has defiantly enjoyed this film. Robert Zemeckis is one of the most creative movie minds in the business. He has always been way ahead in movie technology. Whether it was Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has always been where the future technology is. And the same goes for The Polar Express, which is a visual masterpiece... and an okay story.<br /><br />As stated earlier, the visual effects are amazing in this movie. Zemeckis used a motion capture device, the same thing that video game creators use in sports games. Everything from the train ride to the design of the North Pole (which is the best visual part of the movie) is purely amazing. Also, Tom Hanks plays five different characters. Everyone from Billy to the train conductor to Santa Claus himself, are Tom Hanks' facial and body movements. The major problem to me is that Zemeckis tried really hard to stretch a book that was only about 30 pages long into an hour and forty minute long movie, and some scenes are really stretched out to fill in time.<br /><br />My overall opinion is that this was a good movie, but nothing particularly special. "The Polar Express" will probably become a children's' holiday classic. I would not call it the best Christmas movie ever, but more likely than not, children will find enjoyment in the story of a child who learns to believe again.</p></body></html>

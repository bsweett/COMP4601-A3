<meta name="summary" content="Che's Journey to Self-Discovery and Personal Wisdom..."></head><body><p>Education usually relates to schools, universities, libraries, and books, however, often it is forgotten that society itself can be perceived as a source for information of deeper enlightenment.  Through society and the environments in which people coexist information can be acquired that furthers notions in regards to personal values, beliefs, and morals.  These concepts are seldom taught in academic settings besides spiritual and philosophical classes.  A person's beliefs and moral values illustrate the persona of an individual, and it is often how people connect to one another.  Motorcycle Diaries offers some insights to how these beliefs and morals might have been acquired on a long journey through the South American continent.<br /><br />The 23-year old Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal ) who has gained the nickname El Fuser and later became renowned through the name Che plans a long motorcycle trip with his friend Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna).  The trip is expected to bring them to Venezuela for Alberto's 30th birthday, and on the journey they anticipate meeting several beautiful women to sway.  The two friends do not look at life too seriously, as they expect this journey to become a fantasy come true where they get to do things they have dreamed of for years.  When the day comes they pack up on the "Mighty One", a leaky motorcycle from 1938 that is to bring them to their destination.<br /><br />Carelessly Fuser and Alberto begin their dream trip while almost getting into an accident before they leave the block where Fuser's family lives.  Not thinking of it too much of it the two young men continue their adventure into uncharted territory.  There are several small incidents where they fall with the motorcycle, which could have had dire consequences.  These moments offer a strong opportunity to look into how these two young men observe the world, as it gives some insights to the securities and comforts in which they were brought up.  It also gives a perspective on how ignorant these two young men truly are about the world, despite having advanced degrees or almost finished doctoral degrees.  Furthermore, the name of the motorcycle, the Might One, offers a perceptive analogy with some irony as it gives more detailed depictions of how reckless and absent minded they are in regards to their journey.  Their preconceived notions and dreams have also distorted their perception on how they approach their long journey.<br /><br />The first stop on the long journey is a visit to Fuser's girlfriend, Chichina (Mia Maestro), who lives in an idyllic Alp mansion that seems to be completely out of place.  Even Alberto comments on the mansion's appearance.  However, this first stop visualizes the two friend's dreamy vision of the venture.  This visit to Chichina offers a deeper development of Fuser's personality, which depicts a righteously romantic character.  When they leave it is hard on both Chichina and Fuser, but the trip is something he has to do for himself.<br /><br />Slowly the two traveling companions begin their true journey through the harsh, yet beautiful terrain of Patagonia while ascending the southern portion of the Andes.  They face adversity through weather and wind, hunger, and mechanical breakdown, but they persist on without the idea of ever quitting. Fuser has 15 dollars in his pocket that he received from Chichina, but he does not intend to use it.  Lividly Alberto expresses that the money could help them get out of trouble, but Fuser remains firm on not using the money.<br /><br />The film's turning point arrives when Fuser receives a letter from Chichina, which evidently causes Fuser to feel emotional pain.  The sound in the following scenes brings the audience a thundering murmur, as if Fuser is about to explode.  The scene that shows an elevator going down until the screen turns black visualizes Fuser's emotional state.  This is followed by Fuser sitting in complete silence on a beach by the Pacific Ocean and while in deep contemplation he rereads the letter.  All Alfredo can do is sit and watch his friend, as even his talkative nature does not know how to approach the situation.  When Fuser breaks the silence he behaves more seriously, as if his previous idealistic perception had been shattered and he had been forced to rethink his approach to the world.<br /><br />The rest of the journey slows down as Fuser begins to take his time to get to know the people and the land through which he is traveling.  Through the people Fuser and Alberto begin to see the injustice in the world-something they never could have imagined, as it is not written in the books they have read.  It seems as if they begin to question the foundation upon which they have been brought up, and begin to criticize rules and regulations.<br /><br />Walter Salles who also directed the critically acclaimed Behind the Sun (2001) makes Motorcycle Diaries, which depicts Che Guevara before the years when he led the coup in Cuba.  The film does not glorify Che's political achievements as a communistic revolutionary, but depicts how he might have acquired his values and ideas that made him the man he later became.  This is what makes the film accessible for all viewers, as it is not a political film. It is a film that depicts how a man might have changed, and acquired wisdom to make the decisions he made later in life. In essence, it is a film about learning.<br /><br />The cinematography that Salles employs through cinematographer Eric Gautier is marvelous.  An example is the way camera is used during movement, which brings the audience a jerky and bumpy experience, which brings the film a more authentic feel in the same way as a private home video filmed with a handheld camera.  There are also many other scenes that elevate the cinematic experience, for instance, the many close ups of Alberto and Che's faces.  Those unaware should know that this film is based on a true story; however, it does not point this out in the beginning as most films based on reality do.  This is a clever way of making the film even more enjoyable, which in the end will offer much for the viewers to contemplate through the many hardships that Che and Alberto face.</p></body></html>

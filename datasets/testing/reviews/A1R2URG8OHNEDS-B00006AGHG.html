<meta name="summary" content="Traffic Trouble!"></head><body><p>This movie was simply about a war between two people.A lifeless war with thrills and chills and profanity.The movie was a little different then the movies that I normally see.The cast has big time actresses and actors.Ben Afflick(The Sum of All Fears,Pearl Harbor)Sam L Jackson(Shaft)and Amanda Peet(The Whole Nine Yards,Saving Sliverman)It is decent but I didn't like it enough to give it a 5 star like my other reveiws.<p>The Story:Gavin Banek(Ben Afflcik)and Doyle Gibson(Sam L Jackson)are two men in a hurry to get somewhere.Gavin is heading to court whist Doyle is getting to court to get his wife to stay in the state from a divorce settlement.When the two men are driving Doyle and Gavin are involved in a minor traffic accendent with each other Doyle asks for insurence card so they could settle this.Gavin who is in a major hurry leaves the accendent scene saying "Better Luck Next Time."At Gavin's case he learns that in his haste he forgot an important file that could help settle his clinets case at the scene.But of course Doyle(who loses his case because he was 20 minutes late)is angry at Gavin and will not give him the file back.The war begins.....<p>Changing Lanes was a good movie but it was not the greastest movie that I have ever seen.The preveiws looked so good that I thought that it would be better then it was.But that is only my state of mind.<p>ENJOY!!!!!...</p></body></html>

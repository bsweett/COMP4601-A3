<meta name="summary" content="Interesting film that ultimately falls short of its goal"></head><body><p>In the aftermath of a terrible train wreck, a man finds himself with nary a scratch in the midst of all the devastation, the corpses and the detritus. The only survivor, this seemingly ordinary man David Dunn (Bruce Willis), living a crumbling marriage and working mundanely as a security guard, comes to realize that he is very different from other people. He has never been hurt in his life, has never even had a cold. He meets an intense, strange, brittle-boned man, Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), who informs him that superheroes have always existed in one guise or another, and that David is one such - that David is, in fact, an archetype. David undergoes a  journey of self-discovery as he strives to challenge the limits of his powers, and figure out where he fits in, in a world that has become suddenly eschewed. But Elijah Price also sees himself as an archetype, and not that of a superhero...and that the roles of superhero and -villain must be played out.<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan unveils his love for the genre with the film's implementation of his very heady concept: what if superheroes walked the earth? Unbreakable plumbs the comic book mythology and delves into the pop psychology of the superhero phenomenon. M. Night's conceit is that the archetypes of the Hero and the Villain have always been around, but now have been channeled into contemporary comic book superhero sensibilities. Shyamalan has his "superhero" follow the classic pattern as David Dunn runs the gamut of shocking discovery, the search for existential meaning, the quest for his rightful place in the world and finally, his acceptance of his unique seemingly pre-determined role. In the climactic scenes, David's shapeless poncho somewhat becomes a symbol of this acceptance, becoming, in fact, his superhero costume.<br /><br />The dependable Bruce Willis invests his role with his trademark, career-making everyday man persona and brings home a sense that, yes, this is how a Regular Joe would react to such unusual circumstances. I always relish when he takes the minimalist road as his acting choice (though his mouthy and brash Moonlighting and Blind Date persona is also fun). Either way, he's believable. Samuel Jackson's assured Elijah provides a very good foil for Willis's stoic David. The ever cool Jackson can be relied on to always bring in the noise, the funk and the bravado. Robin Wright Penn's character is nicely miserable but hopeful and should've been more involved in the proceedings. And, while I understand Shyamalan's need to inject a kid character into the story - to symbolize and convey the innocence and wonder of the comic book theme - the kid actor he finds ends up being cloying and annoying.<br /><br />Good or bad, Shyamalan goes the gloom and doom route. There is a sense of prevailing glumness to Unbreakable, a certain somberness to the music, a moroseness to the look and the atmosphere of the film. It infects David's dreary, humdrum life and his on-the-outs relationship with his wife. The pace is plodding, the action pieces far apart. In the special features, M. Night mentions that he had originally conceptualized the film in three stages: David's discovery of his inhuman abilities, his  several encounters with sundry crooks and villains, and, finally, his mega face-off with a worthy supervillain. But M. Night admits he didn't "feel" the last two segments and altered the storyline to this more bleak version. Shyamalan is earnest in his writing and directing effort but *sigh* I wish he'd found a happy medium between his original concept and the version with which he ended. He shoots for the grandiose moments and almost, almost gets there. But not quite. Still, I admire his sincerity and great effort and I was entertained enough to recommend this film: 3 and a half stars.<br /><br />Unbreakable's special features include:<br /><br /> - Additional scenes with an intro by M. Night.<br /> - An in-depth "Behind the Scenes" feature.<br /> - "Comic Books and Superheroes" - a fascinating feature delving into the superhero/comic book mythos with avid fan Sam Jackson, the great Will Eisner, Scott McCloud, Alex Ross, Denny O'Neil, Michael Chabon and Frank Miller (Eisner talks about the origin of his Spirit hero).<br /> - A multi-angled feature on the train station sequence.<br /> - An excerpt from "Millionaire" - an amusing early film endeavor of a younger M. Night in a fight scene with two kids.<br /> - 2 collectible but forgettable illustrations by comic book artist Alex Ross.</p></body></html>

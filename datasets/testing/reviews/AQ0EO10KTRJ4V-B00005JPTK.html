<meta name="summary" content="Hmmmm..... I'll stick with Vincent Price version"></head><body><p>I AM LEGEND could have been a classic film.<br />But it fell flat.... a terrible loss of potential.<br /><br />First the good....<br />1) The scenery work making New York look like a wasteland deserves an oscar. Very well done.<br /><br />2) Will Smith has matured into a very good actor and did well in this film.<br /><br />3) The film borrowed heavily from the Vincent Price film version of this sci-fi classic which is a good thing.<br /><br />Now the BAD..........<br /><br />1) CGI "dark seekers".<br />Hollywood needs to put away the "gee-whiz" gimmickery and sometimes focus on real film making again.<br />These cartoon-looking "monsters" looked so goofy and like the Zombies in the old SEGA video game "House of the Dead" that any feeling of dread and gloom that were established by the great scenery was lost.<br /><br />CGI is still not to the level technologically where it can be used for humans or characters meant to strike a chord of reality or feeling.<br />That's what killed the HULK, recent remake of KING KONG and some other recent films.<br /><br />You simply can't connect or feel "what I am seeing is real" when they are visually divorced from reality.<br /><br />Smith's other film "I-ROBOT" suffered that same problem.<br /><br />2) SPOILER ALERT -<br />...<br />...<br />....<br />....<br />....<br />...<br />When Sam, the dog dies...... so does the apparent pacing of the movie.<br />Others have had the same comment on here.... It seems the 2nd half of the movie pales in comparison to the first.<br /><br />The plot device used to get rid of Sam, was too contrived.<br />ie.... Smith's character get's snared in a trap.<br />Then awakens just at sunset.<br />When he gets down... you ask yourself ............... Okay Buddy why don't you hop on your one good leg ??<br />But NO.... he drags  across the ground until the dark seekers come out and attack them.... THEN afterwards of course when the damage is done, he is able to limp on that same leg and even carry Sam.<br /><br />My wife kept complaining.... "Great the dog dies because he is too stupid to hop on his one good leg and get out of there. They should have re-shot that scene differently".<br /><br />In summary it seems they had the budget to work with, but somehow the film fell FLAT and was OK..... but it is not memorable and will probably be forgotten with time.<br /><br />Even allowing for it's old age.... We feel the 1956 Vincent Price version of this film "Last Man On Earth" actually had a stronger feeling of pathos than this remake.<br /><br />But this new film COULD have been a classic if they maintained the mood of the first 40 minutes and did not turn the movie into a CGI fun-fest<br /><br />PS...<br />The ALTERNATE ENDING is FAR SUPERIOR to the theatrical "Happy Hollywood" ending and while not identical to the message of the novel, does both capture the general message best and also matches the mood of the rest of the film.<br />The theatrical ending really weakened the film and seems like a mismatch tacked on at the end.<br />The "alternate ending" alone boosts the rating of this film 1-2 stars.</p></body></html>

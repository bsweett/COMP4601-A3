<meta name="summary" content="A slightly vulgar yet poignant treasure"></head><body><p>Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis outdo themselves in a movie that manages to be incredibly funny, a moving statement on the value of life as one goes older, a fine horror flick, and a bit foul mouthed for my own tastes.<p>  Campbell plays an Elvis who traded places with an Elvis Imitator back 30 years or so ago having grown sick of the life etc...  Davis plays a JFK who was dyed black by LBJ after the assassination &quot;attempt&quot; in Nov 1963.  The movie is told from &quot;Elvis'&quot; perspective so he believes in himself (but has doubts about JFK) For us both possibilities would seem unlikely, as is the chance of both the King and the President being in the same nursing home in East Texas in 2002.  The film leaves us to decide that.<p>  However it is even more unlikely that an undead Egyptian Mummy is sucking the souls of dead people at the nursing home while writing graffiti on the bathroom walls in hieroglyphics.  Of this the film leaves no doubt.  Since this is even less likely then the Elvis &amp; Kennedy bit it all ends up working smashingly.<p>  We see Elvis reflect on his life, we see time dash by without change until Elvis manages to fight off an attack by the calling card of the Mummy.  <p>  As he becomes useful again his self respect returns and both old men resolve to defend the only home they have.<p>  The film make good use of the supporting cast particularly Ella Joyce as the nurse.  It also plays all the characters seriously.  The battle between the Mummy and our heroes is very much a fight between an undead creature and two very old men and is played totally straight.  <p>  This movie works on every level, Campbell should have gotten a nomination for this role.  It's one of the best movies you will have never seen.</p></body></html>

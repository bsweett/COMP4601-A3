<meta name="summary" content="for once... OSCAR got it right"></head><body><p>Every year I sit back and watch the OSCARS and realize that politics, popularity and past losses play into the equation too much. Yet, this time, I believe they got it right.<br /><br />In the DVD special features, the director of THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND said that the script for the movie had been in lingo for a long time because it relied so much on casting. They had to have the right man to play Idi Amin. He had to be charismatic, youthful, large, larger than life and able to tap into a tremendous evil that erupted at appropriate times. Boy, did they find the right man.<br /><br />The movie is based on a novel written by Giles Foden. The novel depicts a fictional account of a Scottish doctor who manages to get in with the powerful leader and become his right hand man. He's blindly drawn into Amin's world, oblivious to the cruelty Amin is amassing all over the country.<br /><br />The only unfortunate thing is that IT IS a fictional account, but amazingly it gives an indepth look into a side of the man that has never been seen. The Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy), was created based on a collaboration of hundreds of stories, myths and inside tales that have circled over time.<br /><br />The unmistakable truth about THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND is the death count and the carnage that the man is accountable for. 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives under Amin's ethnic cleansing and struggle to maintain power, including Kay Amin, and many other family members. THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND and Amin's wrath is a testament to what can happen when power and ego corrupt a leader.<br /><br />Forrest Whitaker is amazing and the movie is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

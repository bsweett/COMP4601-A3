Fans of the two franchises thought that this movie would have arrived to theaters much sooner than it actually did, since at the end of "Predator 2", audiences got a glimpse of an alien skull in the predator's trophy case, hinting that the two races had already met in combat. For some reason 20th Century Fox had trouble getting the movie off the ground, more than likely the scripts for the film were never good enough to do any kind of justice to either of the two franchises, so the execs at Fox decided to put the film on the backburner until a proper story could be crafted that would please fans of the series'. Eventually Fox found the right man to bring the two monsters together on screen, a director that has had plenty of experience with the science-fiction genre, none other than Paul Anderson (director of "Resident Evil" and "Soldier"). With the cast assembled, a talented sci-fi director behind the camera, and a story that would hopefully do justice to these two hugely popular franchises, it was time for the battle to begin.<br /><br />"AVP: Alien Vs Predator" begins when a team of archaeologists are brought together by Charles Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the co-founder of the very corporation that Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley worked for in the `Alien' series, to explore an ancient temple hidden under the Antarctic. When the team arrives they discover that this is no ordinary temple, it is actually a proving grounds for young predators to hunt the most dangerous prey alive, the xenomorphs (aliens). Now, the archaeologists are in for the fight of their lives as they are stuck in the middle of a war that no matter who wins, we lose.<br /><br />Director Paul Anderson has skillfully crafted an exciting monster smackdown that lives up to the quality of both character's respective franchises. It was interesting to see how this movie set into motion events that take place in the `Alien' franchise (which occurs many years after this movie), by setting up Charles Weyland's interest in the aliens. The movie also takes time to explore the rituals that the predators must go through to become the ultimate hunters, by showing how they achieve their vast array of weaponry and skills. There are other aspects of the story that links into each franchises established storylines, but I don't want to ruin everything for those that may have not seen this movie or any of the other films from the two franchises either.<br /><br />The movie featured a solid cast of character actors led by veteran actor Lance Henriksen in the role of Charles Bishop Weyland, a nod to his character Bishop from James Cameron's impressive film "Aliens". Along with the talented cast, the film also boasted impressive visual effects and costumes that brought the aliens and predators to life, and made their brutal fight scenes incredibly entertaining to watch. Even though it took 14 years for this film to finally be made, the wait was definitely worth it, plus, any sooner may have been too soon, because the technology of the film industry was finally advanced enough to bring this epic war to life in a realistic fashion that will make the creators of the series' proud and entertain fans worldwide.<br /><br />"AVP: Alien Vs Predator" is available in both PG-13 and unrated editions, both contain violence and language.</p></body></html>

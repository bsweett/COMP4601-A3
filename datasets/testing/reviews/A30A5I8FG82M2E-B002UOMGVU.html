<meta name="summary" content="What stinks?  Oops, it's this movie"></head><body><p>Look, I like Marty Scorsese more than most people.  He has made some of the best movies of the past 50 years, like "The Age of Innocence".  But the only good thing about "Goodfellas" is Lorraine Bracco's performance as a strong-willed Karen Hill (they should've called the movie "GoodGal"! Wink!).<br /><br />Joe Pesci won the Oscar for an overly-showy role (I think it was the "Whaddya mean I'm funny?" bit that won it for him).  The statue should've gone to Graham Greene in "Dances with Wolves", which rightfully beat "Goodfellas" for Best Picture and Best Director.  Marty deserved an Oscar for "The Age of Innocence" but unfortunately wasn't nominated that year.  Costner's movie was recognized as the heart and soul of 1990, while "BADfellas" became synonymous with the horrendous ordeal America was unwittingly about to endure:  The Clinton Administration.<br /><br />Lots of ink has been spilled over the violence in this movie.  Yes, it is violent, but Marty would outdo even himself with 1995's "Casino".  Remember, "Taxi Driver" was once controversial for it's violence, but these days any child over 8 can recite Travis Bickle's "You talkin' to me?" routine.  "Goodfellas" dubiously opened up the floodgates for heathens like Quentin Tarantino to turn the silver screen red.  My problem is, as with Tarantino's work, the violent acts in "Goodfellas" are celebrated.  The consequences are not explored.<br /><br />The other troubling aspect of this visually-interesting film is the cocaine that Henry Hill becomes involved in.  The second half of the film is obsessed with drugs, and practically endorses dealing narcotics as a valid way of making a living!  Scorsese should've known better.</p></body></html>

Why don't we take a classic sci-fi flick and remake it?<br /><br />HACK PRODUCER #2: BRILLIANT!!! ALso, let's have Keanu Reeves as Klaatu, add a bunch of random cool sci-fi CG effects and add some random green propaganda?<br /><br />DIRECTOR: Cool, but "green propaganda"...?<br /><br />HACK PRODUCER #3: I know what he means! Why don't we have some totally bulls--t subplot that involves humans being removed from Earth so that the earth will live!!<br /><br />DIRECTOR: THAT'S AWESOME!!! Dude, I never knew how creative some people are!! I haven't even seen the original movie!!! Let's go do that and get some inspiration shall we?<br /><br />HACK PRODUCERS (in unison): NO!!!!!<br /><br />HACK PRODUCER #1: There's a magical little device called Wikipedia. We don't even need see the movie! Why don't we just read the plot and then play around with it! You know, sort of twist it OUR way.<br /><br />DIRECTOR: I'm sold. LET'S DO IT!!!!!<br /><br />*Movie is made and released in December 2008. Nobody cares. Movie flops badly.*</p></body></html>

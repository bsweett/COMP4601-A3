Only now I somehow understood how ingenious and perfect it is. Directing is great (as Robert Rodriguez admits in commentaries it was done with much of a help from Quentin Tarantino), cast is awesome: George Clooney is right on his place here, this was the first movie I saw him in and was pretty imoressed by his acting. For Tarantino as I think this was just the best work ever. Harvey Keitel is amazing as always. Not to mention Juliet Lewis, Denny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini and cameos by John Saxon and Kelly Preston. The film's done perfect technically and visually the plot is hilarious, call it whatever you want - comedy, horror, action, thriller, criminal film - it's all there. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a unique movie made by talents of many people involved. Such set of circumstances happens rather seldom like a solar eclipse. So enjoy!<br /><br />And on the edition itself I'd say it's one of the best I've seen speaking of amount of bonus features. Many deleted scenes (that are really interesting unlike in other movies' editions) with commentaries, on the set features, outtakes that are so funny they worth the whole picture... Anyway you won't be disappointed by this 2-disc edition. I guess I'll watch it again in a couple of weeks :)</p></body></html>

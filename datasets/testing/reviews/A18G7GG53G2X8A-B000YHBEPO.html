<meta name="summary" content="Who Would Choose to Accept This Mission?"></head><body><p>For a moment, I'd like you to visualize the following scenes as depicted in an action movie. First scene: the hero uses a plethora of weapons to fire at a continuously moving target. Second scene: he has to scale a tall structure in order to break into a restricted area and gather information. Third scene: he faces death when the area of the building he's trying to escape from explodes in a blaze of eardrum-shattering glory. And finally, forth scene: the hero has to try to rescue a very important person, namely, the woman he loves.<br /><br />As far as anyone is concerned, I could have been describing sequences from any number of action films. But in this case, they came directly from "Mission: Impossible III," the further adventures of Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) on his quest to save humanity from the ever elusive bad guys and their plot to destroy the world. The formula this film follows is so conventional and uninteresting that I found myself bored out of my skull halfway through. It doesn't help that the eventual outcomes are predictable and ultimately unsatisfying. Isn't the point of a sequel to present something new, something that isn't a virtual copy of the previous story?<br /><br />If you live for this type of entertainment--the type that relies solely on wall-to-wall action sequences--then I'm sure you'll get your money's worth out of it. There's certainly no shortage of action in this film, from exploding cars to shootouts to daredevil stunts on skyscrapers. In this sense the film "works" because it delivers exactly what it promises; anyone who has seen the trailer will know what to expect. And that's the problem, especially since the trailer offers a mere taste of its stunt work. I should think that even the most dedicated action film buff has a limit. Exactly how many stunts can a person watch in one sitting without feeling jaded? I don't think the filmmakers ever once took that into account when making "M:i:III"; the adrenaline pumping moments are so abundant that the film practically drowns in superficial eye candy.<br /><br />As far as the story is concerned, it centers on needlessly sadistic arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). He is in possession of a top-secret item called the Rabbit's Foot (so top-secret is this item that the audience doesn't even get to know what it is). The Impossible Mission Force (IMF) wants Agent Hunt on the job, despite the fact that he's engaged. This particular mission--led by the quarrelling Theodore Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) and Musgrave (Billy Crudup)--is enough to convince Hunt that he needs to rejoin the team. Apparently, Davian has kidnapped Hunt's former student (Keri Russell as Lindsey Farris).<br /><br />The problem with Hunt's job is that it requires him to be a liar, something he'd prefer not to be if he wants to live happily with his fiancee, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). For this mission, he gives her the classic I'm-going-away-on-a-business-trip routine, something she's rightfully suspicious about. In the sole moment of humanity the film has to offer, Hunt asks her to trust him. She ultimately does, but it was given under intense trepidation. It's enough of an answer for Hunt, who then teams up with a dedicated group of professionals to find Davian and his Rabbit's Foot. They include Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames), Zhen (Maggie Q), and Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), all of which seem to share the same skills and know how to get by using the same techniques.<br /><br />Their search first leads them to Vatican City, which prompts them to make use of a multitude of super spy methods (all of which only pass muster in over the top comic book stories). At one point, Zhen takes a picture of Davian's face using an ultra sophisticated camera (it's hidden within a makeup mirror). The image is then electronically transferred to Strickell's makeshift mask factory. Within a matter of minutes, Hunt is transformed into a doppelganger Davian, complete with a voice-altering chip placed on his throat. It was a technique utilized in the previous two films, and frankly, I never once bought it. Even for a work of highly stylized fiction, it was a little too unrealistic for my taste.<br /><br />The scenes continue to go from one to the next as smoothly and expectedly as anyone could hope for. But when Davian kidnaps Julia, things suddenly get complicated. Not surprisingly, this sends Hunt into the depths of panic and fear, almost to the point of losing his edge. What makes matters worse is that a certain member of IMF isn't who he or she seem to be; hidden amongst the ranks is a saboteur who has been in league with Davian all along. Despite the desperate situation, Hunt and his team are sent to Shanghai to continue their mission. It's there that Davian gives Hunt an ultimatum: deliver the Rabbit's Foot in forty-eight hours time, or Julia will be killed.<br /><br />And there you have it: the basic plot description of a cookie cutter action/adventure flick. If it wasn't enough to pique your interest, then it's best to just save your money on "Mission: Impossible III." All you'll experience is two hours of nonstop frenetic activity, enough to last you more than a couple of trips to the theater. However, if I've managed to make you salivate in sheer anticipation, then by all means, go and see it (but be aware that I'm not making a serious recommendation). Is it a bad film? I wouldn't quite go that far. But I will say that it's an unnecessary film, presenting nothing but a collection of cinematic devices that we've already seen many, many times before. It's an uninspired, unoriginal work, and it represents an idea whose time has already come and gone.</p></body></html>

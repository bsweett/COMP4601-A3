<meta name="summary" content="A Genuis that Suspends Belief!"></head><body><p>An old and senile Salieri sits at the piano playing some of his tunes to a young priest.He asks him whether he recognises any of the melodies he is playing. With a polite smile and a blank expression, the priest responds that he did not.Then Salieri stops for a second, and then asks, what about this tune? He plays another, and suddenly the priest's eyes light up in instant recognition and shouts: oh yes I know this one, is this yours?<br />Salieri with a very bitter sigh responds: this is Mozart!<p>What a way to start a film and what a scene to introduce that masterpiece that is Amadeus.<br />A genuis child prodigy that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart took Europe by storm, and success,fame,admiration,sponsorship and financial protection was the natural result.But there was a  darker side to that fame: the excesses, the gossip, the conspiracies, the politics of the court, Mozart's own inner demons, and his peculiar relationship with his father, respect that hides fear. And of course there was Salieri!<br />A veteran at the royal courts, a mediocre composer who has found a secure place for his limited talent,only to find its very foundations threatened by this newcomer..Jealousy and  bitterness were the natural outcome, but carefully hidden by the guise of friendliness and protective wisdom, while Mozart still retaining a trusting naivity that would eventually hasten his downfall.<br />This is the story of THE best musical biography ever filmed(Period!), from a director who is no 'hired hand' but an artist in his own right. It is a very ambitious film, very lush, beautiful to watch and hear, an epic of dramatic and musical propotions.<br />There are good music biographies,like Ken Russell's Music Lovers (Russell has a life long passion for classical music), his own unique version of Tchaikovsky's life, in addition to Lizstmania and Mahler. Beethoven had an excellent and underrated biography in Immortally Beloved, but still Amadeus remains in a league of its own.<br />This status comes from the fact that the director and writer successfully manage to give an equal treatment to the music,the genuis of Mozart, and to the human drama, the essence of Mozart. The opera/concert scenes are not hurried but remain an integral part of the plot.(more of these scenes were added for the extended version)<br />F Murray Abraham won a deserved Oscar for playing Salieri so perfectly, but I would have loved for Tom Hulce to have won his nomination too: a pity since he has brought so much life and creativity to his role.<br />Now another scene,<br />A dying,weak and delirious Mozart lying in his bed is dictating his latest composition to Salieri (pretending till the end to be the trusted friend)..<br />Mozart is slow at first, but then as if suddenly possessed by the demon of music, the notes started flowing, faster than Salieri could write them, and not only flowing but the Italian composer is in a state of sheer disbelief at what he is actually writing, music  that would become the most haunting classic piece ever composed, the Requiem.<br />You too will stare in disbelief at this creativity unfolding in front of Salieri's  eyes and yours too!<br />Now how many films manage to do that??<br />Hmmm..let me see.....</p></body></html>

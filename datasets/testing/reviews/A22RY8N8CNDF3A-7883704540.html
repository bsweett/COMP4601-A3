<meta name="summary" content="Ratty Funny!"></head><body><p>Ratatouille is a sweet and funny animated film.  This is a story about Remy, a young rat, living in the French countryside, who wants to be a famous chef.  Now who wants a rat in the kitchen?  Remy has high hopes and follows his dream. He watches a TV show, "Anyone Can Cook," that features his favorite chef.  Somehow he arrives in Paris, looking for the plump French Chef he saw on TV.  Remy is shocked to find that his amazing chef is dead. Remy has a wonderful memory for recipes and a "taste" for good food and knows how to make it.  Somehow, he and a clumsy new garbage boy get a job at a French restaurant.  Because people don't like rats in the kitchen, Remy controls the garbage boy while under his chef's hat.  He knows cooking and competes with the other chefs for the best meal.  The interactions and jealousy of the chefs and restaurant owner are a delight.<br /><br />Wonderful characters throughout, however, the restaurant critic is absolutely perfect!<br /><br />Many smiles and laughter, great artistry with animation, and the plot had many twists and turns.  The time went fast and an excellent film for all the family.</p></body></html>

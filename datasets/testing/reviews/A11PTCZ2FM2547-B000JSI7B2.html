<meta name="summary" content="Chasing the Dragon"></head><body><p>After watching the first few minutes of this spellbinding film, I pushed away the meatlover's pizza.  Suddenly lost my appetite.  But that's quite all right:  FROM HELL's fascinating story--along with its mercurial cinematography--rapidly overwhelms and consumes all the muck and the gore of London's notorious Whitechapel district of the late 19th Century.<p>Yes, this is (yet) another film about Jack the Ripper, yet it presents the brutal murderer with a most bizarre twist, along with a plot suggesting a motive for the crimes as farfetched as an elephant swimming the Atlantic.  But the zany story works--a story about a small click of Whitechapel prostitutes harboring a secret and subsequently murdered, one by one--in part due to the ingenious visual devices employed by directors Allen and Albert Hughes, and in part due to the spine-tingling acting of Johnny Depp and Ian Holm.  Depp portrays Inspector Fred Abberline, a Scotland Yard detective who, aided by his dependency on opium, laudanum, and absinthe, has an uncanny ability to solve crimes.  Through his drug addiction, Abberline is &quot;chasing the dragon&quot;; when the fragile vulnerability of his character is exposed, the viewer learns the detective is chasing much, much more.<p>Holm plays Sir William Gull, an aging physician of Britain's royal family.  The good doctor is so calm, cold, reserved, detached, and calculating I'll wager he could freeze the mercury on a thermometer.  Holm and Depp easily carry this movie, augmented by haunting images of avarice, brutality, and a less than complimentary portrayal of the freemasons.  FROM HELL is a seat-squirming, stomach-twisting thriller.  And the film gave me an added bonus:  I now have plenty of cold pizza for breakfast.<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

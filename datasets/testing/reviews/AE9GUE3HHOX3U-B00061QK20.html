<meta name="summary" content="Holding Out 4 A Hero (dumb title!)"></head><body><p>I jumped on the bandwagon late for martial arts films.  "Crouching Tiger..." was pretty much my only exposure to this genre of film but it kick started an extreme interest and appreciation for the art.  "Hero" is fantastic, I've only seen the first half, I'm looking forward to seeing the rest since I finally bought it on DVD. I am also eagerly awaiting the release of "House of Flying Daggers".</p></body></html>

Collin Farrell is held hostage in a phone booth in manhattan until he makes amends for his dishonesty.  By who, well, I guess it is the world's best observer with lots of time on his hands (kiefer sutherland).  It was amazing how the movie did a good job at covering the bases to make it so this the main character couldn't leave the booth. Often times in badly written movies within a few minutes you figure out how they people are going to escape. You do here as well, realizing it will have to be the police that figure out what is going on, but it was interesting and at least entertaining how they got their.  Worth a rental, but not really a great thriller for the collection, at least in my book.</p></body></html>

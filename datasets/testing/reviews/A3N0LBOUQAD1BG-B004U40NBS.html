Well for a ballerina named Nina (Natalie Portman, "The Professional") it starts as a great wonderful feeling but jealousy and perhaps some insanity leads to her feeling everyone is out to get her. Once she lands the role in a retelling of Black Swan her director (Vincent Cassel, "Brotherhood of the Wolf") seems to take even more of a liking to her, which a former ballerina (Winona Ryder) tries to warn Nina about. Of course a new upstart comes in (Mila Kunis, "Friends With Benefits") and Nina's obvious mental grip loosens as she is determined to make this role happen and give her greatest performance.<br /><br />While this sounds like fairly typical writing in normal circumstances, director Darren Aronofsky ("The Wrestler") handles it quite well as he presents a true obsession by nina gone horribly wrong as it all seems to be in her head, or is it? It is quite creepy in parts, there is the much talked about scene between Kunis and Portman which doesn't actually take away from the film like some of those type of scenes do.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about Black Swan was it was fairly relentless in it's portaying of Nina's descent into madness, also showing some aspects of her life that show how it isn't too shocking she was mentally unstable even more so as the movie went along. The performances are great, Cassel does well as the director, Kunis does well also as does Ryder but to me the two standout performances are by Barbara Hershey as Nina's mom and of course by Portman herself as this is a career defining role for her. Its well worth watching and doesn't disappoint. **** out of 4 stars.</p></body></html>

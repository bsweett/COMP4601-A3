<meta name="summary" content="We're dreaming, aren't we?"></head><body><p>The general public just doesn't understand this movie.  They were expecting something flashy and maybe action as we were going to look at Tom Cruise and Nicole Kiddman and their "star power" was going to draw audiences unlike before.  But there were no explosions, no car chases, and literally not a lot of action.  This was not meant to be one of those movies, it was a train of thought with a heady, dreamlike atmosphere.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is on a sort of spiritual journey, as he gets it into his head that he wants to cheat on his wife.  He is presented with several situations in which to cheat, but something goes wrong each time and he never physically does.  It's about temptations, having that wonderful little bauble dangling before you and it's just beyond your reach.  A part of us wants it, wants it so badly, but we have to practice some discipline.  Don't be greedy, don't be selfish, and don't talk yourself into thinking that just this one time won't hurt.  It might be deeply satisfying to eat that candy bar now, but in the end it's just a candy bar, you'll be jogging many miles to burn it off, and you're better off not eating it.<br /><br />Some criticism?  It's a LONG movie, and you get very restless throughout.  I wish they had given Nicole Kidman more of a part, as I think her cream long since rose above Tom's even before they broke up.  Due to lighting and camera shots, the movie also has somewhat of a dreamlike feeling.  Everything's a little fuzzy, your buzz never quite wears off, and it leaves you a little nausious from time to time.</p></body></html>

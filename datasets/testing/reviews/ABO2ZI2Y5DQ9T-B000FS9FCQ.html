<meta name="summary" content="V for Visuals and Very Stylish Ones: Masked Musketeer in Totalitarian World"></head><body><p>Whether you may like him or not, `V for Vendetta' is produced by Joel Silver, one of the strongest players in Hollywood, the one behind the successful `Matrix' trilogy, and the script of `V' is written by none other than Wachowski Brothers. First-time director James McTeigue worked as assistant director in three `Matrix's and one `Star Wars' and yes, the titular `V' is played by Hugo Weaving. This time, however, you never see his face hidden behind a mask - like Agent Smith wearing glasses. And fewer action scenes.<br /><br />`V for Vendetta' is set in the totalitarian society of England in the near future, where one masked anti-hero shakes up the nation's political system which is controlled by one Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). To do so, `V' employs a Guy Fawkes method - well, blow up the Old Bailey, you know - and he does it with accompanied music, before an accidental witness Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who becomes the suspect of the case, chased by the secret police.<br /><br />[NATALIE PORTMAN as BALLERINA?] The far-fetched story contains as many elements as possible - actions, humors, imprisonment, and even romance - and there is always something right in front of you that is interesting to see, like the interior of `V''s room, his penchant for using theatrical manners, or believe me or not, one pinkish ballerina clothes Portman wears. The film certainly has several good action sequences, but what is fascinating may be the character of `V' himself, and the far-reaching effects that changes the life of other characters including Evey.<br /><br />To me, however, two actors from UK are more impressive than `V' and Evey. They are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Stephen Fry as popular TV show host. They both represent the ordinary people who attempt to follow their conscience even under the fascist regime without using the terrorist tactics that `V' employs. And they know they are very weak, like Jonathan Pryce's hero in `Brazil.'<br /><br />Compared with them, the acting Portman looks sometimes weak, with the British accent that appears and disappears. The film's reference to one Dumas novel is too obvious, and even detracting. There is one big twist in the middle part of the film, which is not convincing, and most of all, John Hurt's `Sutler,' always yelling before the monitor, is not my idea of the fascist leader in the 21st century. And as to the film's explanation about the emergence of UK's dark totalitarian society, it is as credible as the big secret of the `Matrix.'<br /><br />`V for Vendetta' is absolutely a `love-or-hate' film. Its unmistakable message is represented by the words of `V,' but some of you may find it shallow, and say no one in the truly totalitarian society can act like `V'. It is a curious mixture of the childish (anti-)heroism of musketeer and the sinister image of terrorist. The film tries to mix them, but is not always successful. Still the film's stylish actions and images with unexpected humor are undeniable.</p></body></html>

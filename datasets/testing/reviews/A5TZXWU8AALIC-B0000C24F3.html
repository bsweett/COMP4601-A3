<meta name="summary" content="An Ugly, Depressing Sequel"></head><body><p>I don't know if I've ever seen a sequel that makes so many bad decisions so fast and so early in.  Even before the opening titles were over, I had no idea how this film was going to win the viewer back.<br /><br />Face-huggers get loose in the ship escaping the second rousing film, ALIENS, do their dirty deeds, then die and bleed acid to breach the systems and hulls.  The survivors are jettisoned without ever waking up.  Newt, the adorable little girl from ALIENS, is killed.  Michael Behn's heroic Marine--killed in the crash.  The droid--tilt.  All that's left is Sigourney Weaver and she crash lands on a dreary, dirty prison planet populated with dirty, repellent inmates.<br /><br />All of this in the first five minutes.  Ugh.  On top of all that, they shave Sigourney's hair off and turn one of her eyes blood red.<br /><br />It's almost as if they had a pre-production meeting and asked, "How can we ruin the ALIEN franchise?  Let's ugly up the star, fill the movie with the scum of the galaxy...."<br /><br />There's a reason this is "the least successful in the ALIEN series."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Col. Shaw of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment"></head><body><p>GLORY is a fictionalized account of the 54th Massachussetts Volunteer Regiment (only Mathew Broderick's character really existed).<br /><br />After distinguishing himself at the Battle of Antietam, young Robert Gould Shaw is promoted to colonel and put in charge of a 700 man all-colored infantry regiment-- the first organized in the Civil War (an all-black unit, the 1st Rhode Island fought in the Revolution). Shaw and his drill sergeant prepare the recruits for war unaware that their superiors have no intention of using these troops in combat.<br /><br />The frustrated manual laborer-soldiers were eventually given the chance to engage a Confederate patrol and acquitted themselves well. They next spearheaded an assault on South Carolina's Fort Wagner. Shaw and over 100 of his men were killed in this action and more than 150 were wounded and/or captured.<br /><br />This film's strength is the depiction by a sterling cast of friendships between the men, their struggles with a bigoted military, and the at times uneasy interactions with an empathetic white commander. The battle scenes, culled from two sources (including a 1988 Gettysburg reenactment) are secondary to the human story.<br /><br />(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000051YMQ">DVD version</a> of GLORY is here)<br />Also recommended: the 4-hour epic, GETTYSBURG-- one of the greatest war movies ever made.

Wahlberg (looking more Matt Damon like) is a government agent whose special talent is as a shooter with a rifle that allows him to reach a target a mile away.  Wahlberg explains that there are many things that affect the shot from that distance such as wind, etc.  Glover approaches him saying that an assasination threat has been detected against the president and the government wants Wahlberg's expertise to tell them how the shooter will do it (they tell him that the shooter has Wahlberg's talent to be able to strike from a mile away).<br /><br />Wahlberg scouts out the locations the president is to visit and tells Glover where he thinks it will happen and when.  They go to the location on the day the president arrives to supposedly catch the shooter before he gets to the president.  As this happens very early in the movie, it is fairly easy to guess that Glover is just using Wahlberg to perform the assasination himself and then blame Wahlberg.<br /><br />Glover's plan to eliminate Wahlberg after the shooting fails and most of the movie after focuses on Glover and his corrupt government men trying to get Wahlberg before their operation is blown.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of great action and makes the viewer think that going forward, no political leader may be safe from assasination if he could be easily hit from a mile away by someone with Wahlberg's gun.</p></body></html>

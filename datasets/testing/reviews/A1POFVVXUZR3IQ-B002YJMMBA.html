<meta name="summary" content="3.5* - action-packed and engaging thriller"></head><body><p>Firstly, this is a review of "Angels and Demons", the single-disc theatrical edition. The rating on this movie is PG-13, distributed by Sony Home Entertainment (2009). The extras included are:<br /><br />"Rome Was Not Built in a Day" (17:30) - this featurette covers the amazing effort that was put into recreating the Vatican, St. Peter's Square, the Sistine Chapel, and all the other landmarks in Rome. Lots of interesting information regarding set design.<br /><br />"Writing Angels and Demons" (10:00) - this segment deals with the actual adaptation of Dan Brown's novel from print to screen, and the resulting changes.<br /><br />"Characters in Search of the True Story" (17:00) - this examines the major players in the movie, and includes interviews with cast members.<br /><br />"Cern: Pushing the Boundaries of Knowledge" - here, director Ron Howard visits the Cern Super Collider and viewers get to 'see' what the facility is about.<br /><br />There's also the A&D soundtrack info and movie previews of "Julie and Julia", "2012", "The Maiden Heist", "An Education", "Year One", and "The Da Vinci Code".<br /><br />Subtitles are in English and French.<br /><br />Movie Review<br /><br />The movie diverges from the book quite a bit, enough I think to annoy ardent fans of the book. Though I enjoyed both the DVC and A&D, I also enjoyed both movie versions. I think in A&D, the essence of the story was preserved, and so I have no major grouses with the movie adaptation. The main theme explored in A&D is the perennial battle between religion and science. A canister containing anti-matter (and highly volatile at that) is stolen from a super collider facility where scientist Vittoria Vetra is working (played by Ayelet Zurer). Meanwhile, in Vatican City, the Pope dies, presumably from a stroke and the College of Cardinals gather in Conclave to elect the new Pope. Things become complicated when four of the Cardinals (who also happen to be prime choices for the Papacy) are kidnapped. Here is where our beloved symbologist comes in - Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, looking a lot better than in DVC, and also with a better hairdo) is roped in by the Vatican to investigate some mysterious symbols that point to an ancient foe of the Vatican, the Illuminati. Soon enough, both Langdon and Vittoria find themselves trying to desperately unravel the clues so that they can help save the kidnapped cardinals. They find obstacles in the form of a taciturn head of the Swiss guard , Commander Richter (played by Stellan Skarsgard), and things are also made difficult by Vatican politics, embodied in the tension between the deceased Pope's Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl).<br /><br />The acting was well-done by all accounts in this movie - due to the fast pace, there really is no in-depth character development. Hanks plays a credible slueth/symbologist and though his miraculous 'saves' defy credibility at times, he puts on a credible performance for the most part. Ms. Zurer is also suitably intelligent in her role as the scientist, and Skarsgard puts on a good performance as the enigmatic commander of the Swiss Guard. Both McGregor and Mueller-Stahl are wonderful as always, and I thought McGregor's role was the most well fleshed out in this movie.<br /><br />So, in the final analysis - this is an enjoyable thriller with plenty of twists and will please fans of the genre. It is not altogether faithful to the book, but it does retain its essence. The cinematography is exquisite - the glorious wonders of Rome's architecture is a delight to watch on-screen, and the score suits the religious themes in the movie quite well.

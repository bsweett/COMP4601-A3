This is a phenomenal piece of cinema.  Christopher Nolan and Dody Dorn improve upon many of the startling editing, structural, and narration techniques they solidified for Memento, but here serving the story rather than the other way around.  The character arcs, call-backs, and use of dialog are thrilling.  Magic, and all the concepts surrounding it, including the double meaning of "the prestige", are intertwined intrinsically.  This may have come from the novel, but it's a feat to translate anything so complicated with such purity when adapting forms.  I found this film to mesh organically into itself with nary a self-conscious or contrived air to be found.  While there were a few times I wished there was a tad more fire, spark, or intensity to the delivery in key scenes, the tone was always dead-on from the talent and I never found it unbelievable.  David Bowie and Christian Bale, in particular, give remarkably nuanced performances...right down to one of the final whispers.  I was also impressed with Hugh Jackman's final scene in the film, and how earlier he made such a perfect showman.  The cinematography & lighting no doubt had a lot to do with it, but I'll give him credit for really filling out the role.  Make sure to see this before it leaves the theaters, in an auditorium with good, loud sound, tight fine focus, and a bright lamp.  You'll regret it later if the first time you see it is at a cineplex run by incompetents or, god forbid, on DVD.</p></body></html>

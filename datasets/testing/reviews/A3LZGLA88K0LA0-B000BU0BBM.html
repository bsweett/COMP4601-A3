THE BROTHERS GRIMM is like watching a more sophisticated version of the old TV Fractured Fairy Tales, using elements of several Grimm fairy tales but giving them sardonic twists and turns.  In this film, the titular brothers are con artists roaming villages of French occupied Germany, allegedly ridding the villages of evil enchantments.  Things take a dangerous turn when they are captured by the French and forced to find out what is happening in a small village where ten children have mysteriously disappeared.  This leads them to the Mirror Queen, who has cast a spell on the village and is using the children's blood to return to life; she is now an old crone, and wants to be beautiful again.  Production values are excellent with superb effects and moody settings.  The tongue in cheek humor instills the movie with its sense of fairy tale wonderment and the acting is generally good.  Matt Damon plays Jakob, the more mature brother who is like a keeper to his rather nerdish younger brother, played by Oscar hopeful Heath Ledger.  They play off each other very well and seem to be enjoying themselves as well.  Lena Headey is the fair Angelika, whose two sisters are among the missing children, and she acts as a tracker for the brothers.  Peter Stormare gives an over the top performance as the General's aide.  Stormare surely gives his role 100% per cent, although his accent is sometimes very hard to understand.  Gilliam alumni Jonathan Pryce plays the General and he is very good as well.  The lovely Monica Belluci plays the Mirror Queen quite seductively.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is an entertaining take on fairy tales and was overly blasted by many critics, but I think you'll find it enjoyable.</p></body></html>

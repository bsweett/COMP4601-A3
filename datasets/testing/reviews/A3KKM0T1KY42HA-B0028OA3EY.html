Singer lead Marvel's X Men and X2...ummm...marvelously. So turning the helm over to Singer for DC Comic's Superman Returns was a big buzz.<br /><br />Perhaps Singer has been watching too much Smallville? Don't get me wrong, I think that Smallville is excellent. However, with Superman Returns my expectations were not set for a slow moving love story between Superman and Lois Lane...which is what 50% of the movie is; I would expect that kind of filler from Clark and Lana in the TV series Smallville...lot's of episodes to fill.<br /><br />Plus based on how action-oriented Singer's two X Men entries were, I had very high expectations for Superman Returns. The action was indeed good in Superman Returns, but it was predictable. There were no surprises. The special effects were good; the flying looked better than any Superman movie ever. But nothing that made me say out loud, "Oh, cooool" or "That is awesome!"<br /><br />And the story really fell flat. In fact, it was almost a re-do of Lex Luthor's quest for real estate in Superman 1. I've seen much better stories in the Justice League animated series than Superman Returns. Much better.<br /><br />Some of the situations in Superman Returns were very far fetched, i.e. (without revealing any spoiling details): Superman crashing via meteor back to earth with no public fanfare; Richard White rescuing Lois in a sea plane; Luthor Waltzing right into the Fortress of Solitude. I'd have liked to have seen more realistic scenarios like the excellent job David Goyer and Chris Nolan did with Batman Begins...just...more realistic.<br /><br />So perhaps Singer should have stuck with X Men 3 and let someone else have Superman Returns...but that is not the way the cookie crumbled. In fact, Singer has signed on for Superman: The Man of Steel scheduled for release in 2009.<br /><br />Brandon Routh was a pretty good Superman preserving the Christopher Reeve portrayal almost mirror image. Kevin Spacey was a good Lex. And Kate Bosworth was a bit young looking for Lois.<br /><br />After saying all this, I didn't think it was a bad movie. It just fell far short of what I expected. And that basically took a smile and turned it upside down.</p></body></html>

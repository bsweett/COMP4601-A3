This time Harry Potter is a in a competition for the goblet of fire. This competition is a battle between 3 schools. Hogwarts, Beaubaton and Durmstrang. The special effects are amazing and the music is also quite brilliant. Some parts might scare small children so a grown-ups hand or a teddy bear can come handy. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

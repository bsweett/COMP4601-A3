<meta name="summary" content="Not so blown away"></head><body><p>I was blown away when I saw the Matrix for the first time and still rank it among my favorite movies ever. I was looking forward to the sequel and again it is good. <p>The story continues about Neo fighting in the Matrix with Morpheus and Trinity. The enemies are now more, hundreds of Smiths and a very scary albino twin. There are however too many fighting scenes and sometimes it is very obvious that computer graphics have been used, even for real people. The scene with Neo fighting hundreds of Smith is absurd.<p>But still, the graphics are amazing, the choreography is very worthwhile and the story keeps you thinking as well. I wasn't dissapointed, not at all, so watch it if you liked the Matrix I</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="undistinguished sci-fi action flick"></head><body><p>Like its 2004 predecessor, 2007's "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem" aims to determine which of the iconic sci-fi creatures would come out on top in a mano-a-mano, winner-take-all battle - as if anybody cared.<br /><br />Before getting to the creatures themselves, it should be noted that a number of familiar faces from TV headline the cast.  In a role much different from the endearingly clueless fireman he plays in "Rescue Me," Steven Pasquale stars as a tough-guy law enforcement official whose small Colorado town is being overrun by a bunch of pesky, bloodthirsty critters from outer space, the townsfolk being pretty much just collateral damage in what is, clearly, a much more epic battle being waged around them.  And Sam Tremmell from "True Blood" and Reiko Aylesworth from "24" also get some big-screen time to add to their resumes.<br /><br />Not that the human characters in this kind of story matter much anyway.  And after decades of overexposure (remember how truly terrifying the first two "Alien" films were?), the bloom is clearly off the rose when it comes to both these creatures - and since neither ever speaks, it's not exactly a duel of wits that's going on between them.  And, besides, the movie is shot so dark, it's virtually impossible to see what's taking place onscreen anyway.  That doesn't do much for the coherence of the storytelling, but what does it really matter when it's all just about guts, gore, gadgets and goop, after all?</p></body></html>

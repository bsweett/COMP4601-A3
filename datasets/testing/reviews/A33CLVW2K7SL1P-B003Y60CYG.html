Subtle and funny at times, it also displays a remarkable depth in both story line and characterizations. Metaphors abound, and I have no doubt that if I sat down to watch the movie again I would find things that I missed the first time around. The most interesting character was the theater itself - and by extension the theater's ghost. Often when an all-star cast such as the one in this movie is assembled, the resulting production often feels like a mess of egos. With Robert Altman's sure hand in the director's chair, and the nearly awed respect that all the actors had for him, that would never have happened here. And it didn't.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Long and boring and much too long.  Don't waste your time!"></head><body><p>I understand that the story of Alexander the Great has been told many times.  Alas, though, this 2004 Oliver Stone version just doesn't work.<br /><br />Collin Farrell is cast as Alexander.  His acting is fine, if not exceptional.  But the material he has to work with is awful.  First of all, Angelina Jolie just isn't convincing as Alexander's mother.  Second of all, there is an overriding theme of Alexander and his male companion, Jarad Leto, having an intimate relationship.  This is only hinted at however and as far as romantic scenes are concerned, a lot more time is given to Alexander and Rosario Dawson, cast as his wife, Roxanne.<br /><br />The film is full of pomp and wise old men, such as Anthony Hopkins, cast as Aristotle, saying wise things.  Naturally, there are a lot of long and boring battle scenes.  And, worst of all, the film is almost three full hours long.<br /><br />I wish I could say something nice about this film but I can't.  My advice is just don't waste your time.  Not recommended.</p></body></html>

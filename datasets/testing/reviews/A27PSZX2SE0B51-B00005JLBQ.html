On The Road To Perdition"></head><body><p>For those of you confused by the title, this is not Hope and Crosby's version of the Faustian myth.  It's Sam Mendes follow-up to "American Beauty".  It's Tom Hanks most internalized acting performance.  It's Paul Newman making a rare, and much needed, return to the big screen.  It's Jude Law with bad teeth and a balding patch, Jennifer Jason Leigh with almost no lines, and Conrad Hall with another virtuoso example of how to light a movie.  It's all these things and more.  But somehow, it also manages to be all these things and less.  But more on that later.<p>Like in his previous film, Sam Mendes gives away the fate of his main character within the first couple lines of dialogue.  The wheel has been set a-spinning, and the only question is how it all plays out.  Mendes is a director less interested in the final destination than in the road taken to get there ("Road to Beauty" might have been a better title for his first film; then again, "American Perdition" would be quite apt here).  Although, to be fair, the final outcome appears more in doubt here than in that last effort, even with all the gangster talk about "the life we chose" and "none of us will see heaven."<p>Visually, Mendes knows how to frame a scene.  Mostly, we see things from the point of view of Michael Sullivan, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), the eldest son of Mike Sullivan, Sr. (Tom Hanks), lead enforcer for town boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  Mike Jr. stows away in his father's car one night, in the hopes of finding out how the old man pays the bills.  Through a hole in the wall, at feet level so all he can see of his dad are his shoes, he witnesses the brutal, tommy gun murder of a bootlegger.  This is the moment that sets the film down its road.  Mendes handles it perfectly, allowing the audience to experience the scene as Young Mike does: the visceral destruction and the sorrow of it all, the sonic boom of guns going off in unison, twinkling as bullet shells hit the floor.  Watch how this scene, with its over-the-top cacophony of sounds, is contrasted by a later shooting.  Scored only by the powerful rhythm of the ocean, which sounds like the breathing of a giant, and bathed in white light, whereas the earlier scene was set on a rainy night, the emotional resonance of this scene is heartbreaking.  It's a skillful cinematic moment, made more impressive when one realizes it was filmed by a man making only his second movie.<p>Hanks is quiet and reserved as the cold-blooded mob killer.  It's not a very glamorous role, though.  Sure, he shows prodigious talent at his job.  And he gets to stomp around armed with a cool noir get-up: fedora, overcoat, tommy gun.  But he looks worn down, dirty, unshaven, and, quite frankly, pudgy for the majority of the film.  No matter.  Because even when he's not saying anything, Hanks manages to say everything.  His eyes do much of the work here, replacing the charm that he usually uses to get through big parts.  It's not as fine a piece of work as his best performance, "Saving Private Ryan", but it's got many of the same characteristics, and is surely in the same ballpark.<p>Newman, relegated to playing supporting character parts these days, proves he still has the chops to rise to the occasion.  Rooney must be a lovable old coot (he is), a distant father (he is), a feared dictator (he is), a man capable of menacing anger (he is; to my surprise, Newman still has the force of will to bang on a table and make the whole room feel it), and one who can just as easily resign himself to his own fate (he does).  The silver in his hair and the wrinkles on his face may age him, but that low, tremulous voice help him deliver another in a long line of vintage Paul Newman performances.  He's still a treasure.<p>Jude Law has a fairly enigmatic part.  Best known for works where he is the definitive male object of desire, here Law sports a thinning hairline, unkempt fingernails, and rotting brown teeth.  I question the choice of casting Law for this role, like I question the choice of casting the gorgeous Cameron Diaz in "Being John Malkovich": why not just get an uglier actor?  But, like Diaz, Law acts his way into my good graces (just like he always does).  His photographer/killer moves like an agitated cat.  Even though the character is somewhat two-dimensional, Law manages to bring him to life.<p>Sadly, these three actors, some of my favourites, don't get many chances to shine together.  But when they do, you aren't going to find anything better.  A cast full of fine actors supports them.  Stanley Tucci is reserved and business like as Capone right-hand man Frank Nitti.  Daniel Craig does well showing the envy and pettiness of Connor Rooney, a son tormented by a father who'd prefer he was a different man.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, an actress of stunning power, has absolutely nothing to do here.  If I counted right, she has but three lines.  Shame, that.  And young Tyler Hoechlin doesn't do anything outstanding as Young Mike, but that's probably for the best.  Inexperienced kid actors who try too hard get on my last nerve.  Hoechlin plays it close to the chest and it works.<p>Although greatly marred by an opening and closing narration, which felt forced, tacked-on, and unrealistic in a film rife with harsh reality, "Road to Perdition" is a fine technical piece of work.  While something intangible keeps it from becoming a great film, one that you can clutch to your bosom as an example of the human condition writ large, it still manages to be very, very good.</p></body></html>

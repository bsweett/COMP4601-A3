So you can expect to see in this movie the same humor and irreverent jokes that gave fame to the show. The idea for this movie came up as a way to make fun of the Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which everything is action and we get to see things exploding all the time, and in the most crucial moments of the film, action is interrupted with a sentimental thing; well, all those things are here and believe me, you'll never see a Jerry Bruckheimer film the same ever again (if you get Parker and Stone's sense of humor) The idea of using puppets came from the creator's hate to actors, something they explain in the additional documentaries on this DVD.<br /><br />The story opens with Team America saving France from a terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction, one the members dies and it is time for them to find a replacement: an actor (wait till you listen to the reason, hilarious)<br /><br />From the very beginning the movie surprises with the level of detail of the scenarios and the characters, the production is unbelievable. Also we get to see that behind all the fart jokes and the simplest humor, there is always a sharp critique to the so called `American way'. Team America decides what's best for the world, even if that implies destroying every place they visit. Also the `Film Actors Guild' takes its share of critique, actors trying to pose as figures of influence are not an invention of these guys (Matt Damon is simply one of the funniest characters in this film); Michael Moore is also present in a fatal moment for the team. But the most interesting thing is to see Kim Jong Il portrayed as the villain (the song he sings is one of the most memorable moments of the movie); it is told that he is an avid movie collector, it would be interesting to know if he owns this movie and his opinion about it, but hey, these are the same guys that gave Jesus Christ a TV show! Can we expect them to respect someone? I don't think so.<br /><br />The musicals are present (even Broadway appears on the movie), the way the use the dramatic music is amazing (check it out when Gary vomits) and makes these moments even funnier, the dialogues are crazy (the foreign characters don't talk a thing and instead say things like `Ping pong' or `Derka derka muhamed ali') and the voices are as funny as the ones in South Park (most of them performed by Trey and Matt)<br /><br />The awkwardness of the puppets is the best humor resource used in this film, the way the puppets walk is way too funny (and this is done intentionally), the characters pointing at things and then missing, the `help signal' Gary has to make when he is in danger, all of those are quite simple things that will make you laugh it up.<br /><br />The movie is presented with English 5.1 surround, English and French 2.0, subtitles in English and Spanish. The documentaries included in relation with the making of the movie complement perfectly and explain the reasons behind the making of this movie and the whole creative process. The uncensored edition has a couple of scenes added to the sex sequence between the puppets, somehow resembling of the video of Cartman's mom in `South Park the movie'<br /><br />Bottom-line, a very interesting film in the way in which it was produced and a hilarious piece of comedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Same Heroes, Changed Villain"></head><body><p>The Fantastic 4 are very close to what they were in the comics (although Reed is far less confident) but Victor Von Doom is very different.  His origin is now the same as the Four and his powers are very different.  He could really have been a new villain altogether.<br /><br />As this is the first movie, we get the full origin tale as well as an adventure.  Our four heroes were on a space station during a storm and received amazing powers due to genetic changes.  Victor Von Doom is also on the station and receives powers.  First our heroes have to come to grips with their powers as they try to find a way to return to normal.  But their powers become very useful when they realize they have to stop Doom.<br /><br />The writers did a very good job of transplanting the Four into a modern setting.  Johnny Storm is more of a celebrity than before but it is within bounds.  There were quite a few interesting scenes with Ben Grimm (The Thing) and how his change affects his ability to do things.  Many of these seem to have been taken from another comic hero, Concrete, but still fit.  All in all a pretty good adaptation but I really did not like the changes done to Doom.  He is no longer the honorable villain and is just an evil bad guy.  Still, it is worth checking out if you are a fan of the Four.</p></body></html>

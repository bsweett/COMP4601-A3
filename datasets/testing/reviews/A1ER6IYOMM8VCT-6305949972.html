<meta name="summary" content="GREAT DVD AND MOVIE  ....BUT"></head><body><p>This movie is a visual treat! Tim Burton can certainly come up with all the visual elements in a film, but he lacks in his story telling sometimes. The music in this film is mediocre at best and is one of it's biggest flaws. Please don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but it is not one of the greatest movie ever made as many have claimed. The music is boring and drags sometimes especially if you copmpare it to 'James and the Giant Peach' where the songs are very good and drive the film. "James" is much more entertaining on a story level too. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a beautiful looking film and has great characters, it also has fantastic animation and who doesn't love monsters?, but it just doesn't quite live up to the cult status it has achieved.</p></body></html>

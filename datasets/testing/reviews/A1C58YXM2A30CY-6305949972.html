<meta name="summary" content="Merry Halloween!"></head><body><p>For me Tim Burton had been an on & off success - he did an awful job with Planet of the Apes but really soared with Ed Wood.  So renting this movie was with some trepidation.<br /><br />But it's not so!  Henry Selick directed and Burton produced a great stop animation feature, something you don't see much of today, nor in 1993 when it was produced.  With a technical team that took three years to make, the film is really the sum of its parts.  Great film!<br /><br />The story is a simple one with a simple theme.  Jack, the Pumpkin King in Halloween-town has just pulled off another great Halloween complete with vampires that look like Nosferatu and a few horror icons from old films and weird wickedness!  But Jack is bored of the whole thing and wanders around and bumps into doors that lead to holidays - a big heart door for Valentines', an egg-shaped door for Easter.  What's this?  Christmas-town?<br /><br />After much analysis of what makes Christmas, Jack decides to make Christmas in his own Halloween-obsessed image to hilarious results.  A ragdoll girl, recently created, has a crush on Jack and tries to stop him before her premonition comes true and both holidays are lost.<br /><br />favorite scenes:  I like all the wild and crazy characters but especially the Boogey man who rolls those bones (literally) and takes Santa captive.  Another is the mayor of Halloween-town who has a spinning head - one with smiles and one with a fearful frown.  Could this be a metaphor for those who change faces when things don't go well?  Nah!<br /><br />Memorable themes by Danny Elfman!  And a great "making of" feature where we meet the director, producers and tech personnel and all the hard work they put into this film.  Quite impressive.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I had heard a criticism on this film that children would confuse Christmas with Halloween, which is nonsense.  The film is light-hearted, makes fun of itself and has great themes of trying something new and if it doesn't work out, at least you tried!  Good work Tim.<br /><br />Other Animated Burton Products:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UAKE9Y">Coraline</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C3L27U">Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

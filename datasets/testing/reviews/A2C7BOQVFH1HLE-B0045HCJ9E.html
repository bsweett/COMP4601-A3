<meta name="summary" content="Extremely Enjoyable and My 2nd Favourite Hitchcock Film! Now In Blu-Ray Book Format!"></head><body><p>I'm not sure about why the more recent reviewers are having so much trouble with their dvds and I can only assume that the recent batch out of the factory has got major product quality issues as my copy works just fine albeit I bought mine at least a couple of years ago.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound quality as well as the picture quality of my dvd is excellent too.<br /><br />People have to recognise that most of Hitch's films combine elements of humour together with suspense and thrills and what makes this film great is the nice balance of these that's apparent.  The witty dialogue and snappy one-liner jokes delivered by the brilliant Cary Grant still hold up well today.  The Kafka-esque storyline is meant to be so outrageous as to be funny and if taken in that spirit many of the scenes are very entertaining indeed.  The ludicrousness of trying to kill "George Kaplan" by filling him with alcohol and then helping him drive off a mountain's edge, being chased by a crop-duster in the middle of nowhere, etc make fans of Kafka's works like "The Trial" and "Metamorphosis" who can appreciate the genre truly appreciate and enjoy this film masterpiece.<br /><br />Granted some of the scenes do not make much logical sense such as when Eve Kendell talks to Martin Landau's character from a phone booth while he is doing so from another phone in the same line of booths and the strange way the crop duster slams into the oil tanker but that's just the point with Kafka-esques situations in that they are supposed to be ridiculous.  Despite these screenplay "shortcomings" the acting is very good and I liked the camera angles very much for an overall very good film.  Great combination of humour, thrills and spills, tension and drama makes this a classic film for the ages.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 11 May 2011:<br /><br />Amazon will not let me review the 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray Book Edition separately and so I'll have to append it here.  This film does benefit from the 1080p treatment picture quality-wise although the improvement is not a vast one as compared with the DVD release that I wrote about before.  There are also a few frames interspersed here and there which are poor but overall it is still an improvement albeit not massively so over the DVD.  The sound quality however is an improvement worth shouting about coming in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround sound although there are some weak audio spots at certain parts especially when it comes to dialogue.  The picture book is nice to behold and will please collectors and fans alike.  The special features are what really make this reissue worth shouting about as we have various directors like Friedkin, Scorcese and Spielberg talking about how Hitchcock influenced them and you even see spots in their movies where they borrowed from elements of Hitch's work.<br /><br />Overall, this is a worthy upgrade of the film more so for the great special feature documentaries than for the picture and sound quality which despite being still better in 1080p than the dvd release is not a great leap better in my opinion.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

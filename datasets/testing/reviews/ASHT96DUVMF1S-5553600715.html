On top of this is a cast of actors who work seamlessly together.  Nicole Kidman brings to life her role.  What I loved most about The Others was the little use of special effects.  The unknown is much more fearful than a 50 million dollar FX budget.  Place this movie among the classics like Halloween.  This type of film will make you jump and cringe at what might be around the corner without losing your interest in the middle.  I loved The Others and think that any horror movie freak will also have a fond enjoyment of it.<br />Apart from the film the DVD transfer is excellent.  Most of the movie takes place in a dark house.  Colors are dark and deep.  I recommend to turn out the lights taking away the reflection which might occur.  In Digital 5.1 I heard an array of sounds perfectly placed to enhance the experience.  I felt as if I was in the house.</p></body></html>

Yes, the first half hour of this movie is a little corny and could have played out better, but this movie is very good.  The locations, characters, battles are all stunning and contribute to Ridley Scott's vision of the crusades in Jerusalem.  Unfortunately this DVD doesn't have a commentary by Scott, but some of the procuction footage is cool to watch and the 2 seperate documentaries about the real life crusades are interesting.  This movie might not be perfect, but it's still very good and worthy of at least one view by any Ridley Scott fan.</p></body></html>

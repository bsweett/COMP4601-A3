<meta name="summary" content="Affleck, the wooden face."></head><body><p>Affleck is simply one of the worst actors of his generation. His pal Matt Damon is miles and miles ahead of him in terms of acting capability.<p>Add this to a book that was not translated into the screen: it was &quot;butchered&quot; into the screen!<p>Clancy's novels are always seven hundred pages or more of highly technical details and hundreds of subplots: it's almost impossible to adapt them properly (that's why some of Stephen King's novels are adpated to mini-series; that's why Peter Jackson adapted The Lord Of The RIngs into three films).<p>A waste of time, but you can still rent it for a laugh. Just don't buy it.</p></body></html>

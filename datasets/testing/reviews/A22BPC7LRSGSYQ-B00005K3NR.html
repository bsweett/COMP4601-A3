<meta name="summary" content="A very unique kind of horror film"></head><body><p>Carrie (1976) is one of the more unique horror films, based on the novel by Stephen King.  It has a down-to-earth feel to it, with the upcoming high school prom and a girl named Carrie White (played by Sissy Spacek) who is always being picked on by her classmates.  Carrie White possesses telekinetic powers that few people know about.  Her mother, played by Piper Laurie, is a religious fanatic who is extremely strict with her daughter, even to the point of physical abuse.  Carrie grows to hate her mother as time goes on.  This movie suddenly makes a sharp left turn and goes from being basically a teeny bopper high school prom movie to a horror movie filled with blood and destruction.  This movie can be summed up like this:  It is a movie about getting ultimate revenge on the people who have hurt you both physically and mentally.<br /><br />Spacek and Laurie both received Academy Award nominations for their roles.  This movie also stars John Travolta as a partying slacker named Billy Nolan who is in on the ultimate prank against Carrie White in this movie.  It also stars William Katt as Tommy Ross, who is Carrie's prom date, and PJ Soles as Norma Watson.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best performances were by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, the two Academy Award-nominated actresses.<br /><br />This DVD has good special features, including a documentary called "Acting Carrie" with Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving, Betty Buckley, etc., and a documentary called "Visualizing Carrie" with director Brian DePalma.  There is also a featurette called "Carrie The Musical", an animated photo gallery, and a biography called "Stephen King And The Evolution".<br /><br />This movie has good special effects for its time.  I highly recommend this movie to all horror movie fans.  A must see.</p></body></html>

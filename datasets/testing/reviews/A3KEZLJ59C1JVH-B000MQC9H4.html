<meta name="summary" content="A cute little romantic comedy"></head><body><p>"The Holiday" is a cute, romantic movie about two women, Amanda and Iris (Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet), who both find themselves royally screwed over by the men in their lives. Amanda and Iris connect via a housing-swap Web site and agree to switch houses for two weeks in order to escape during the holidays. Amanda heads to England, where she is immediately swept off her feet by Iris's charming brother, Graham (Jude Law). Meanwhile, Iris arrives in L.A. and is blown away by Amanda's posh lifestyle. She befriends an elderly neighbor (Eli Wallach) who is a retired Hollywood screenwriter, and ultimately finds an unexpected new love interest in Miles (Jack Black), a film composer.<br /><br />This is a fun little movie. I enjoyed the Amanda/Graham scenes most of all. Diaz and Law have excellent chemistry and make a great on-screen pair. I am a huge fan on Winslet and she did a great job in the film as well, but the scenes with her really dragged on a bit in the beginning. There were too many scenes where Iris was just sitting around lamenting about her cad of an ex-boyfriend. My other major beef with this film is that I do not understand why Jack Black is in it. Was no one else available? I have no problem with Black, but this just isn't his type of role, and there was absolutely no romantic spark of any kind between him and Winslet.<br /><br />In spite of its few flaws, I still enjoyed "The Holiday" very much. It's a sweet romantic comedy that will make you laugh and smile.</p></body></html>

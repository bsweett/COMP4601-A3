I guess if Rwanda had wells of oil perhaps the great west could more readily recognize a true axis of evil.  However, it never cease to amaze me the evil men can do.  While watching this I kept wondering where was I and what was I doing when this horrible event was happening...and quite honestly I don't know.  The writers and director of this movie performed an excellent job in telling this story and I highly recommend it.  Perhaps we can all learn from it and see to it that nothing like it happens again.</p></body></html>

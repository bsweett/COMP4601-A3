It never tries to be anything but that and hits right on the old heart strings. It is suppose to be based on a true story which in todays world might have meant that a white guy applied for a job and was a track star and they got this movie out of that story. I think that Will Smith was going for Tom Cruises record of being the greatest runner in the history of cinema. Smith, who I don't think is a great actor but who does an adequate job runs, runs and runs some more thru this entire movie. His little kid is perfectly cast again as the 'little cute kid' who tugs those tear ducts and pulls at your heart.<br /><br />Not a great movie but a good feel good movie.</p></body></html>

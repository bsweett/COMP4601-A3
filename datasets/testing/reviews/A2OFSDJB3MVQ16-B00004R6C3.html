<meta name="summary" content="Carpenter's 2nd horror classic"></head><body><p>Largely ignored at the time of release, Carpenter's "The Thing" has grown in stature in years to become a cult classic. With his compatriot, Kurt Russell and a great cast (Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley, David Clennon, Keith David in one of his first film roles, Donald Moffat, Richard Masur, etc), Carpenter fashioned a film that is closer to the original story, "Who Goes there?". This was one of my first HD's that I purchased, and it is definitely a test on the audio/visual aspects of your system. Along with the original "Halloween" and "Assault on Precinct 13" this should have put Carpenter in league with Spielberg and Lucas but unfortunately his work has been mediocre in recent years.  Definitely a must see for horror/sci-fi fans and Carpenter buffs!!</p></body></html>

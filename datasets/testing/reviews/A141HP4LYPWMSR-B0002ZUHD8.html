Not since `The Magnificent Seven' in '60 has there been such an exciting film about a courageous and valiant band of warriors facing insurmountable odds on the field of battle.<br /><br />Synopsis: Seven knights are all that remains of the feared Salmacian fighting forces in servitude to the Roman Empire. The time of Rome's departure from Britain has come and the surviving warriors now await their long promised release from duty. However their appointed time of freedom is withheld until they undertake one last mission, a mission that will bring them face to face with a massive army of invaders from the North. Freedom is in the balance, both for themselves and the British Isles. The choice they make will make them legends.<br /><br />The legendary seven are; Clive Owen (Arthur), Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan), Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Joel Edgerton (Gawain), Ray Winstone (Bors) and Ray Stevenson (Dagonet). This is an epic tale with an unforgettable cast. I never get tired of watching this film.<br /><br />Also outstanding performances by Stellan Skarsqard and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere.</p></body></html>

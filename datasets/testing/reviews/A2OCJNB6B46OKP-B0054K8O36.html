<meta name="summary" content="Same Ol' Pirates."></head><body><p>After 7 years we return back to the days of Captain Jack Sparrow and the swashbuckling mayhem of Pirates of the Caribbean. Under new leadership of Rob Marshal and replacing Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightly (For now) with Ian McShane & Penelope Cruz it makes for another action packed, laugh filled Pirates adventure.<br /><br />Simply put, if you have seen the first 3 and you liked the first 3, then 'On Stranger Tides' will be movie you will like as well. I was glad that they went back to the first film and realized that a simple easy to follow story is better than something overly complicated. Having Johnny Depp & Geoffrey Rush do what they do best as Jack and Barbosa, it's a winner. Still, the fact that it is just another 'Pirates of the Caribbean', well it may not always be a good thing.<br /><br />So apparently there will be a possible Pirates 5 & 6 as a "New Trilogy" I am wondering where the next adventure will be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""One Of The Best Movie Trilogies!""></head><body><p>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd star in this sci-fi adventure<br />trilogy directed by Robert Zemeckis. This classic trilogy focuses<br />on Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown's time traveling adventures.<br />I've always loved these films and glad to have them together on<br />dvd. All 3 films have nice picture and sound plus amazing extras.<br />I highly recommend this set because it's one of the best movie<br />trilogies.</p></body></html>

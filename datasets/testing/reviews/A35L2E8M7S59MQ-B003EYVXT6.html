<meta name="summary" content="Please say what I saw in theaters was NOT the real ending to this great film"></head><body><p>I hope there is a director's cut of Splice.  I really, really, REALLY hope with the DVD it will be like 2007's I Am Legend and have on a bonus disc the film's original ending.  Why do I say this?  Well, I haven't researched much, but Warner Brothers once again - just as in I Am Legend - has a decent sci-fi movie that ends on a low-note.  I'll put it this way: up until the final 15 minutes I thought Splice was one of the best science-fiction films I'd ever seen.<br /><br />Just about everything in Splice works up until it reaches a generic, action climax.  Great acting from the cast and a sympathetic creature make the film a compelling sci-fi drama.  One of the best I've ever seen.  An easy 5/5 movie....until suddenly some executive seems to have decided the film needed to transform into a horror creature-feature in the last fifteen minutes.  It becomes so generic and predictable in these last 15 minutes and....terrible.  I can't see any explanation for this other than Warner Brothers repeating I Am Legend.<br /><br />Dren (the creature) was NOT a monster.  She was a fascinating individual creature that I could feel sympathy for.  The way Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) interact with Dren is very powerful.  You can tell that the characters come to love Dren and that Dren cares about them, making for a tragic, yet powerful ending to the film...until the before mentioned last 15 minutes appears which almost completely ruins this drama.<br /><br />Now, seeing as the film will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray I'm hoping to see an addition with "Controversial Original Ending!"  (by controversial they of course mean the GOOD ENDING).  I will re-evaluate the film at such a time as an alternate cut is released.  I refuse to believe that Guillermo del Toro, the writer of Pan's Labyrinth (who is the executive producer of Splice and someone who praised the script) could have supported a script that shoots itself in the foot in the ways that Splice manages to in its final 15 minutes.<br /><br />When Splice is released on DVD/Blu-Ray please, please, PLEASE hold out for a cut with the "original ending".  It may save you some money to buy a single-disc theatrical cut but please do NOT support WB's altering movies to make them "more marketable".  Splice is a great sci-fi movie that is destroyed by a lackluster ending that is entirely inappropriate given the dramatic nature of the rest of the film.  Tell Warner Brothers, and other companies that we want movies to have the endings that work FOR that particular movie.  Splice was NOT intended to be a horror movie and as such WB/producers shouldn't have attempted to transform it into one with 15 minutes of sub-par creature-feature footage that destroys the poignant beauty of the rest of the film.</p></body></html>

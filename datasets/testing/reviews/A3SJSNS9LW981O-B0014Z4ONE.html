<meta name="summary" content="A terrific Trilogy!"></head><body><p>Indiana Jones arrives, DVD style.<br /><br />My purchase worked perfectly, no technical problems or peeling labels.<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark is a great script, full of intrigue and ominous mystery. The Ark of the Covenant reigns as a frightening artifact,  one even the Agnostic Jones is forced to respect.<br /><br />Small touches of humor are also well done ... "Asps. Very dangerous. You go first!"<br /><br />The Temple of Doom is a less intriguing story, and more outlandish... but it's a manic and entertaining ride. Again, the humor will make you laugh out loud...  although it is a bit insulting to woman (the Kate Capshaw character).<br /><br />The Last Crusade is also well crafted, and Sean Connery plays a terrific senior Jones. The Father and Son dynamic is the best feature of this film!<br /><br />The enigmatic feats needed to reach the inner sanctum of the "Petra" fortress... where the Grail is hidden... are ingenious. The centuries old Crusader knight does stretch believability beyond the norm, however.<br /><br />These are tremendous films. Enjoy!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

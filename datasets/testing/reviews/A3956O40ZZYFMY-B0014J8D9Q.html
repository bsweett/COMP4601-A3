<meta name="summary" content="Second greatest western?"></head><body><p>I wrestle with my mind wondering whether this is the second greatest westerb ever made or just where it sits or whether one should divide quality ratings by time period.<br />I'll just go the simple route and say that in my opinion Clints movie, The Unforgiven, sits only behind Fords, The Searchers, as the greatest western ever brought to film.<br />I screwed up and bought the DVD after seeing the movie "in house". I should have forseen the development of Blu Ray and waited. Now I am fighting with myself over whether to spring for the bucks to buy the Blu Ray version as well. Might not. Might just wait until Dish brings it to Hi def television and trap in on Tivo.</p></body></html>

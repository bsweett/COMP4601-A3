<meta name="summary" content="Stars for the BD options and quality..."></head><body><p>I had really high hopes for this one in wanting MNS to make a popular and successful film that customers will want to see. Every once in awhile I do an in-store sampling (random customers watch the films on the HD display and give feedback) prior to release to see how the release might fare (big mistake with this one).<br /><br />Out of 136 customers who filtered through last night whilst displaying the movie, 100 said they will not be renting or buying it now, 25 outright walked away laughing and several kids liked it. Needless to say, this movie was very disappointing. The lead performances, storyline, special effects, and writing were all sadly poor and subpar. Those stories I heard about in theaters of people laughing when the movie had meant to scare you or make you feel sad rang true here too. What I did notice was an unplanned target audience materialized - 12 to 14 year olds. Each kid liked it due to either the corny scare factor or the fake gore. Seven or eight 15-16 year olds walked through that had already seen it and all stated the movie sucked.<br /><br />So anyway, technically the BD has some nice offerings. All the featurettes and extra tidbits are as they are listed here, and most are in 1080. The trivia track actually turned out to be boring on the facts, but it does allow you to incorporate all of the extra features on the disc while watching the film. The deleted scenes were mercifully removed as they were atrocious, and as MNS admitted in the intros to them - they detracted from the film he had wanted people to see - especially all the extra gore. One thing on this BD I had not seen before was the ability to mute the main menu music (if left idling). The wind effects sound great on the DTS HD, and the transfer looked flawless; so much so that the CGI effects looked really bad.<br /><br />I can see why this movie fared poorly, and I know ZD and Marky Mark are way better actors than they show here. The best summary I can come up with is: that volumes of people kept laughing as they listened to the film (while shopping in the store); Mostly due to how corny all the acting/lines/character interaction sounded, let alone how bad it looked while watching it. Watch it for the sound and clarity - skip it for every other reason thinkable.</p></body></html>

Tony Scott's flashy cinematography and quick jumps only served to derail the action, and key plot devices are lost in the cinematic mayhem.  The use of comic book graphics throughout the film, even when you knew what people were saying was another distracting element.  All this flash and artsy fartsy nonsense overshadows good performances from Denzel Washington as the assassin/bodyguard; Dakota Fanning, marvelously realistic in her role as Pita; Radha Mitchell as the child's tormented mother; and Christopher Walken's role as Washington's buddy.  Mark Anthony needs to stick to singing, and the almost unrecognizable Mickey Rourke's role was useless.<br /><br />The movie is graphic in its portrayal of violence, and also sadomasochistic.  Sure, these guys deserved what they got, but Denzel's relentless revenge is not satisfying to watch.  The ending...well, it was to be expected, but didn't serve this viewer.  It's all too long, as well; but if Scott had shown more restraint in his overblown direction, it may have moved faster.  Not a diamond in Washington's career, but it's not his fault.  Give Tony Scott some Zoloft or something, and maybe he'll become a director again instead of an MTV clone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE BLUEPRINT FOR DARK COMEDY"></head><body><p>Kubrick's enduring masterpiece on the insanity of nuclear war, made a few years after the Cuban Missle Crisis, still holds it bite. Peter Sellers in three equally hilarious roles is at his absurdist best, but Sterling Hayden as Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, and George C. Scott as ultra-paranoid General Buck Turgidson encapsulate the words ' military intelligence ' in epic fashion. DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB is still the grand farce to end all farces, and it is a must have for anyone with a funnybone.</p></body></html>

Those infected with the virus are called hemophages, or vampires.  In this movie, however, the hemophages don't literally suck the blood from people, they use other sources, such as blood banks or what not to retrieve their fuel.  Violet is a hemophage, who has decided not to take it anymore, and she joins up with a hemophage resistance group.  When the humans discover a "weapon" that will destroy all hemophages, the hemophages send in Violet to retrieve the weapon before the government can use it.  When Violet discovers that this weapon is really a young boy, she decides to betray everyone she's ever known for some random child that she knows nothing about.<br /><br />First, let me start with the positives of the film.  Firstly, the film is visually stunning.  It looks very similar to Wimmer's previous film, Equilibrium, but Ultraviolet is a lot more colorful than the dark environment of Equilibrium.  Secondly, the action scenes in the film actually aren't all that bad.  The first 20 minutes of the film is straight up action, and after that point, I actually had my hopes up a little bit.  Yes, the effects look fake most of the time, but the film was obviously trying to look like a comic book, and it succeeds in that aspect.<br /><br />Now, the negatives, which are fairly numerous, so I will try to be brief.  The first, and worst, negative of the film is the acting.  Simply put, it is horrendous.  Milla Jovovich has never been known for her acting ability, but that is why she is normally in films that really require no emotion from the leading lady.  Unfortunately, the writing in this film requires Violet to actually show emotion and caring for this boy that she is protecting.  It isn't just Jovovich's lack of acting ability, though, it is also the inept script that Kurt Wimmer put together.  One second, Violet is portrayed as an extremely lethal, uncaring vampire, who will kill anyone in her way.  The next moment, and for no reason, we are supposed to believe that Violet would betray everyone she's ever known just after seeing the boy,  not even talking to him or finding out exactly why he is considered a "weapon."  The "Archcardinal," the villain, is also a horrible actor.  I don't even know this guy's name, and I never want to.  Portrayed as the classic movie villain, he has so many cheesy lines that just make you want to laugh, no matter how serious the film is trying to be.<br /><br />It is also amazing how the film drags in the middle.  Even though the film runs a meager 85 minutes, it seemed like it was at least two hours long, and that is really unbelievable.  When there isn't action occurring onscreen, it is pointless dialogue about a plot that the viewer knows absolutely nothing about, except for a brief overview by Violet at the beginning of the film.  Ultimately, I just found myself sitting in the theater, just waiting for the film to finally come to the end, and when it did, I was overjoyed.<br /><br />The really sad thing about the film is that the basic setup could actually be used to make an interesting, possibly good movie.  I think that Wimmer was trying to send a message through the film, as he did with Equilibrium, but he failed as a filmmaker on just about every level in this film.  Whatever message Wimmer was trying to send, it was completely lost in the grade-school acting, boring dialogue, and ridiculously overdone (but enjoyable) action scenes.  Her name is Violet, and she is in a movie that you definitely won't understand (or like).</p></body></html>

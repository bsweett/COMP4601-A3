<meta name="summary" content="Excellent movie..."></head><body><p>I didn't like this movie on my first viewing.  I was pretty depressed at the end of it because I was thinking of these motivated soldiers that were being screwed by the politicians from the beginning.  Then I went to see it with my mom and I saw it in a different light.  It is not your typical Vietnam War movie.  The soldiers are actually motivated.  The officers are not portrayed as glory seeking medal hunters (except for one).  The soldiers aren't high on dope.  The Vietnamese actually were portrayed as humans.  All in all, a very well done movie.</p></body></html>

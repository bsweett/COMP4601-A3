<meta name="summary" content=""There's nothing wrong with you Katherine!""></head><body><p>Proof is all about the urge to reach out to someone, the painful fragility of both creativity and personal relationships, and the unnerving propinquity of madness and genius. It's a stagey and talky film, that offers up some excellent performances from its lead cast, and gives them some terrific opportunities to indulge of unabashed histrionics, but too often the film feels strained by its propensity towards fussiness, earnestness, and self-importance.<br /><br />The film begins on a rainy night in Chicago in the home of Robert (Anthony Hopkins). Robert is a groundbreaking mathematician, a prodigy who made major contributions to three fields and revolutionized one of them twice before he was twenty-two. His unstable 27-year-old daughter Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) now inhabits the house and as she sits absent-mindedly changing the channels on the TV, Robert comes in and engages her in conversation about her forlorn state.<br /><br />From the moment Robert opens his mouth, something is not right, and in fact it's immediately revealed that Robert has just died, setting the film's plot in motion. Catherine is soon visited by her New York-based yuppie sister Claire (Hope Davis), who begins to take over he life, but also visiting is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Robert's who has become a professor in his own right.<br /><br />Soon we learn that Robert's mind was devoured by dementia; Catherine who is afraid of following in the footsteps of her father is certain that she'll inherit the mental illness that laid him low. Robert was not just a genius; he also was someone who increasingly went in and out of sanity. He'd had lucid periods, one lasting a full nine months, but the last three years had been marked by bouts of madness that included filling 103 notebooks with compulsive writing.<br /><br />Haunted by her father's past, Catherine becomes increasingly paranoid - she begins to believe that Hal may be using her to gain access to a new proof, whilst she also comes to the recognition that her controlling sister Claire is fully prepared to sell the house and move her back to New York for "treatment."<br /><br />The Proof of the title means two things: the specific mathematical proof that either Catherine or her father may have written, as well as the human need to offer proof, to demonstrate to others our value, our worth, the truth of our talents and the sincerity of our emotions. Mr. Madden and Ms. Paltrow do a fine job of bringing these urges to life; and they do an even better job of dramatizing the internal barriers Catherine must break before claiming her life as her own.<br /><br />Depressed and inert, prone to long-winded episodes of conversing with her dead father, Catherine is convinced she'll spiral down if she accepts her own considerable mathematical talents. Clare sees her as a discomfited, somber, and wary woman with few social graces and multiple hard edges. And although Claire might come off to somewhat of a b*tch, she really does have her younger sister's best interests at heart. Both her and Hal, each for their own reasons, desperately wants to help Catherine regain her footing.<br /><br />Brilliant acting aside, the film's stage-bound qualities seem problematic, with director John Madden's tendency makes the characters and the story feel unduly predictable. It doesn't help that the overall conceit of the plot - the discovery of who really wrote "the proof" gets tied up in circles; did Catherine write it or didn't she? With this section of the movie just going on a little too long. Overall though, the film is largely successful, perhaps due to Madden's and Ms. Paltrow's obvious familiarity with the material - both help increase the film's intensity to the point it trumps the underlying earnestness.<br /><br />But the best thing about Proof is Gwyneth Paltrow's formidable performance as Catherine. When she unleashes her emotional range and carries Catherine's internal conflicts on her face and in her body language, she shows why she remains an actress now capable of taking on any role. Her performance is so psychologically naked, her on-screen uncertainty and insecurity so piercing, that the raw pain at the core of this story never fades from view; hers is a performance that redeems everything else about this film.

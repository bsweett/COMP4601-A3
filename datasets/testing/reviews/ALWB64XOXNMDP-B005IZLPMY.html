<meta name="summary" content="Captain America The Best Super Hero Movie This Summer!"></head><body><p>Captain America was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby back in the 1940's.  This was one creation that didn't involve Stan Lee.  Stan was responsible for the Captain's revival back in the mid- 1960's.  Ironically, a  1990 feature film version of the Captain prominently displayed Lee as the creator.<br /><br />Captain America was one of the first to show the element of genetic engineering or "super serum".  The movie shows character actor Stanley Tucci as the German scientist who recruits Steve (Chris Evans) Rodgers for his experiment. The scientist wants a humble man who "knows the value of strength".  He wants a man who knows failure and weakness. He doesn't want an ego maniac who could turn into another Adolph.<br /><br />On the other side of the globe, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)is preparing an attack on the U.S.A. and overthrowing Hitler.  The Cosmic Cube, which is a device in Stan Lee's 1960's Captain America revival, holds the key to his power.<br /><br />The movie places all it's elements together at a fast pace. We even get to see Bucky, Cap's partner. Although in this version he doesn't have the costume.  The Howling Commandos make their appearance.  Sans Nick Fury in this movie, because he's alive in the 21st  Century.  Neal  McDonough has a few moments as the ever popular "Dum, Dum Doogan, Fury's burly and  mustached right hand man. If you're a fan of the comics; you are in for a special treat.<br /><br />That's the advantage of Marvel producing this film. I would have to say out of all the super hero movies this summer, this is the best of them all. You won't be disappointed if you're a die hard fan like myself.  The directors commentary provides lots of unknown information on how the film was made. You get to hear the director, Joe Johnston  talk about how the movie was developed from the ground up.  This has to be the most plausible version of the character I have seen.<br /><br />There were four attempts to bring the Captain to the screen. In the 1940's there was a mediocre movie serial, that didn't follow the  Captain's mythology. In 1979 there were two TV movies with actor Reb Brown. That version brought him into modern times. However the script was very slow to develop.  The 1990 feature film starred Matt Salinger  son of the famous author) as Captain America.  It also featured Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox in supporting roles.  That too was also painfully slow to watch.  What the current producers see was the fact that fans want to see action on the screen. Not two hours of talking heads.</p></body></html>

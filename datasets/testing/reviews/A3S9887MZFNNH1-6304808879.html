<meta name="summary" content="The best British horror film ever made!"></head><body><p>What can I say? This is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. It's so clever, both script and characters. This original spawned 3 sequels to date but none of them live up to this mordern masterpiece of horror. I  strongly recommend HELLRAISER (Not for the faint hearted.)</p></body></html>

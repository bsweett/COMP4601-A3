<meta name="summary" content="Wrong river but great story"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies worth re-watching. All the things you expect from the British when they are captured by the Japanese and forced to build a bridge.<br /><br />This movie was shot in Sri Lanka as it best fit the story. However the real river was not the Kwai. That just happened to be a better name for the river. And the real bridge was not wooden.<br /><br />My favorite character was William Holden as Shears, The only pragmatic charter in the movie. Shears did not have to keep a stiff upper lip or save face or any of that sort of stuff. Where as Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito, had to go face to face with each other's interpretation of honor.<br /><br />This is best depicted in one statement from Shears:<br /><br />"You make me sick with your heroics. There's a stench of death about you. You carry it in your pack like the plague. Explosives and L-pills -- they go well together, don't they? And with you it's just one thing or the other: destroy a bridge or destroy yourself. This is just a game, this war! You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like a gentleman... how to die by the rules... when the only important thing is how to live like a human being."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADD5">Lawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition)</a></p></body></html>

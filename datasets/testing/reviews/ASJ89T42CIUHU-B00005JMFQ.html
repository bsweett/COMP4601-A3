<meta name="summary" content="Actually All That Love Should Be!"></head><body><p>"Love Actually" is the perfect feel good movie for anyone who has ever felt the innocence and pitter-patter of butterflies in your stomach as you fall in love.<p>This British film starts out a little shaky until you get involved with the stories behind all of the eight couples who will weave their way into the hardest of hearts. The movie contains many well known actors like Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth as well as a few cameos. It is well written and somehow all of the interesting characters end up just as they should.<p>Hugh Grant plays the British Prime Minister who falls in love with his assistant and as usual he is adorable and quirky, especially during his solo dance scene. Emma Thompson plays a wife who exists in a 13 year marriage believing it to be perfect until an unexpected Christmas gift from her husband ends up being for someone else. Your heart will break as she pulls herself together while Joni Mitchell sings softly in the background, "Both Sides Now." Liam Neeson is a recent widower who spends the film helping his adolescent son cope with his first case of puppy love....really adorable and holding all of the innocence that young love somehow always contains. Laura Linney is the ever responsible sister of a handicapped brother who is never able to break herself away from her duties in order to pursue her love interest, although she reaches that pinnacle of greatest accomplishment in unrequited love, that perfect moment where it all appears to work. Colin Firth is a writer who falls in love with a foreign maid while trying to work. His pursuit is both funny and touching as he learns another language and obviously does not master it while pulling an entire little town into his pursuit of love and relays the fact that love really can cross those awkward barriers. All of the rest of the stories are just as intriguing and often times gut wrenching for romantics.<p>A perfect film to watch when love treats you wrong and you need to feel right. You will be reminded of all those simple treats that come with love. From innocent starry-eyed puppy love all the way through to a lengthy marriage that is safe and secure despite the wretched boredom. It shows you that love can work and even if it doesn't another flicker will always come along if you let it. The soundtrack is its own character as great background music influences many of the scenes. It is corny, campy, silly, touching, at times stiff and then again provocative....its actually all that love is in all of its various shapes and forms.</p></body></html>

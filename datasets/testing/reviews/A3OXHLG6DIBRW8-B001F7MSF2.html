<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Sequel - Recommended"></head><body><p>I liked "Hellboy II" quite a bit and found it to be surprisingly entertaining.<br /><br />No spoilers from me. The plot follows the continuing adventures of Hellboy as he deals with more supernatural menaces (fairies, elves, and worse), odd friendships, a change in management, and girl troubles.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, the special effects are *VERY* good, and the acting is on par with the first movie. This is a worthy sequel!<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

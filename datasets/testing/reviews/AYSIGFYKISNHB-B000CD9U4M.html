<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's Remake Is A Smash"></head><body><p>I had a very good feeling that Tim Burton was gonna make a great remake of this classic story. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is definitley one of the year's best films.<br /><br />This version of Ronald Dahl's famous story is more closer to the book than the first film based on his book. But, I still love the original film.<br /><br />Both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder play different types of the character Willy Wonka. Depp was more wackier, more comedic and also twisted. Wilder's is more meaner, more saecastic and twisted too. Both actor's did a very good job play Wonka.<br /><br />The Oompa-Loompas in this film were cool, too. But, I still like the original Oompa-Loompas in the original film better.<br /><br />Tim Burton brings out a very cool style of the Chocolate Factory and brilliant visuals. This is a fun film for everyone, and definitley a film for the whole family to sit down and have a great time.</p></body></html>

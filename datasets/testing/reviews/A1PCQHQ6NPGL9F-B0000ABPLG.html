<meta name="summary" content="Good Film"></head><body><p>Equilibrium isn't perfect by far, but it definetly will entertain you at times.<br /><br />Certain parts of the movie are wonderful. The fight scenes are awesome. The gun parts are cool, but there are also sword scenes. Although there aren't as much of those as guns, they are awesome. Christian Bale does a good job, as usual. Taye Diggs is perfect.<br /><br />Now for the bad. Certain parts of the movie are real slow. It seems like the beginning of the movie isn't that inspired. As the movie progresses it gets better, but the beginning just doesn't have that much substance. Certain parts throughout the movie are slow as well, such as the scenes with Emily Watson. I think most would agree that although many of the characters don't show emotion(that's part of the plot), only certain people can pull it off and still seem captivating. Emily Watson just seems too lifeless, and she formed a bond with Christian Bale that feels uninspired every time I watch the film. I think they could of made a reason for their love, but instead she just seems like a way to tack on a romance to a film that doesnn't need one.<br /><br />This film is really good at times, but it could have been done better. Still, I would reccomend any fan of the Matrix or the book 1984 to watch it.</p></body></html>

Bruce Willis returns as "Detective John McClane" in this fourth and hopefully not the last "Die Hard" film. Bruce Willis proves he still has it.<br />  Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) is into math-based security, but also is a young computer hacker at his home, meanwhile at the same time, a woman, Mia Linh (Maggie Q) is in a warehouse with a group of professional hackers. Their plan with the evil Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is to wipe out all utilities and The Federal Investigation Bureau.<br />  Meanwhile, our hero John McClane (Bruce Willis) is spying on his estranged daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), because he hasn't heard from her in awhile.<br />  John gets the call to find the hacker Matthew Farrell. When John finds Matthew at his apartment, it turns out the bad guys are also out to kill Matthew.  John saves his life and takes him to Washington DC to turn him in to the F.B.I, however they soon realize this unintentional accessory may be of some help.  John takes Matthew along for the ride in search of the evil Thomas Gabriel and Mia Linh.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Cliff Curtis, Jonathan Sadowski, Andrew Friedman, Zeljko Ivanek.<br /><br />  Special Features: Audio Commentary with Bruce Willis and Director and Producer. Behind-the-Scenes and music video.<br /><br />  This film is the best "Die Hard" film we have seen in a long time, although some of the special effects stretch the reality realm abit, but all this makes a great "Die Hard" movie we would watch again.<br /><br /> Update: A Good Day To Die Hard will be released February 14, 2013.</p></body></html>

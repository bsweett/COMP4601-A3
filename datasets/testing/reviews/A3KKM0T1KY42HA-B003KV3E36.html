<meta name="summary" content="Fourth Blood"></head><body><p>I can honestly say that I remember nothing about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHP3G">Rambo - First Blood Part II</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHP3Q">Rambo III</a>, and that's a pretty good indication of how far apart the quality of those two movies were in comparison the awesome 1982 original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5TVKI">First Blood</a>.<br /><br />What made the original so good was that it was the story of a guy wronged by prejudice that brutally fights back against a corrupt system. In First Blood, John James Rambo went from a regular guy to a viciously skilled ex-green beret that you do NOT mess with. In the next two sequels, there is no more regular guy...just "Rambo"...the mercenary-like tough guy that's here to do some damage.<br /><br />Rambo 2008 gives Rambo back a little of the regular guy feel. Rambo is living in what appears as a small fishing village in Thailand where he is approached by some missionaries seeking transportation up river to atrocityville (Burma). Rambo gets the do-gooders to their destination, but things do not go well at all for the missionaries when they come under attack and are captured by the Burmese Army. And it's Rambo to the rescue.<br /><br />The action is great (sometimes a bit over the top, but hey, that's what we're here for, right?) and, as fully expected, Rambo deals out some major just desserts to the bad guys. The fun is packed into a movie that only runs for only about 85 minutes...which is a welcome relief from Hollywood's binge of 2+ hour films.<br /><br />But the nature of knowing that Rambo is going to be this hired gun (again) to get the bad guys versus the victimized loner from the first movie made Rambo 2008 as predictable as they come for me. Nonetheless, I was thoroughly entertained by Rambo 2008 (and I'll certainly remember it versus the forgettable former sequels).<br /><br />Rambo 2008 is required viewing for action movie fans.</p></body></html>

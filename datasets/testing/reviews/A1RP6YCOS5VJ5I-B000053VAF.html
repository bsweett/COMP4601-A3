As a matter of fact, I didn't find it offensive at all. This is entire film is in good humor and there are many laughs to be had in this movie! Jay and Silent Bob make the film when they are on, but there are many other characters just as funny.<br /><br />Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alank Rickman, Chris Rock, Jason Lee and all of the others come through and make the characters they play really come to life and be believable. Ben and Matt are great as the two angels killing those they say are sinners to bring the fear of God back into peoples lives. Alan is great as the angel who isn't allowed to drink, even though he isn't on that much, he's really cool. Everyone is great! Overall, this movie is really worth seeing if you are a fan of Kevin Smith.</p></body></html>

In only a few moments the movie gets rolling and never lets up.  Mixing action with a pretty good storyline to get any non-comics reader up to snuff on Iron Man history, this movie really does a good job.  Not overly gory and mild language make this movie okay for teenagers.  One quick sex scene without any nudity does make this a parental decision for anyone with younger kids.  After Fantastic Four I was really surprised by the quality of this film.</p></body></html>

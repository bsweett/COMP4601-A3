<meta name="summary" content="Will He Discover the Dead Woman's Secret?"></head><body><p>All one has to do is read the first few chapters of a pulp detective novel to understand what Brian De Palma's "The Black Dahlia" is like. The trailers and television ads are in no way accurate in terms of conveying the kind of movie it is. They led me to believe that it was a realistic and incredibly dark period piece. In reality, it's a heavily stylized reinterpretation of Film Noir classics, so much so that it almost comes off as campy. A fictionalized world is represented, one in which every character smokes and speaks in overly dramatic tones. I should have known it would be like this; it's based on a novel by James Ellroy, the same man who wrote the equally stylized "L.A. Confidential." But the fact that "The Black Dahlia" is commercially misrepresented doesn't make it bad. Quite the opposite; it's incredibly well made--so stylish and engaging that it refuses to let the audience off easy.<br /><br />The story is a carefully crafted mystery, mixing a real event with fictional characters and circumstances. This real event is the murder of Elizabeth Short, a young aspiring actress (played in the film by Mia Kirshner). Her body was found in the vacant lot of a Los Angeles neighborhood in January of 1947. Not only was her mouth sliced open from ear to ear (making her look like an insane clown), her body was also severed in two at the waist. On top of all that, her blood was drained and a couple of her vital organs were removed. Such a disturbing crime has remained unsolved to this day, a fact that made the film's story that much more interesting. This is in spite of the fact that the actual murder is just one piece of the puzzle. Again, the ads sell this movie short; the Elizabeth Short case is not the sole focus of the plot, despite being prominently alluded to. The truth is that many mysteries are interwoven.<br /><br />I suppose this may not suit those of you expecting a purely factual experience. It won't much help that the story is maddeningly complicated, pretty much to the point of utter confusion. It's not the kind of film you can passively experience. It demands your full attention right from the get go, with one crucial point after another piling up until it becomes a massive heap. This is problematic for me, a humble viewer; describing the plot will be very difficult, not only because it's loaded with details and twists that I can't give away, but also because I'm not sure I caught every detail and twist.<br /><br />It begins with a voiceover narration, specifically that of Officer Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett). Already the tone of the film is set; specific shots are encased in shadow and smoke, and the music is heavy with smooth saxophone solos. In terms of dialogue, his pacing is as deliberate and colloquial as that of a classic private eye detective (I half expected to hear him say, "That's when five-feet, seven-inches of trouble walked in"). When not on duty, he spends his spare time as a boxer, as does Sergeant Leland "Lee" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). While the two are fierce competitors in the ring, their everyday relationship hints at a close friendship. At least, it's close enough for Lee to trust Bucky around Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), a former prostitute who's now Lee's girlfriend. Eventually, Bucky begins to suspect that he does have feelings for her.<br /><br />The two cops initially focus on the impending release of Bobby DeWitt (Richard Brake), Kay's severely abusive ex-pimp (look for his initials on her backside). As the film progresses, the audience will come to understand that DeWitt is but one of the many contributors to a tangled web of circumstances, all of which interconnect in some form or another. What makes the situation even more complicated is that many--if not all--of the characters are duplicitous, some more than others. As the film winds up, many of these characters are exposed during a replay of key scenes. Here's an example: there's an early scene of a shootout, one that initially seems straightforward. While I can't get too specific about it, I will say that it's replayed at the end, and at that point, some of the most important figures are shown in a different light.<br /><br />Everything comes to a head when Elizabeth Short's body is discovered. Lee and Bucky are assigned to the case despite their concern over both Kay and the release of the dastardly Bobby DeWitt. It ultimately proves too much for Lee, who's obsessive need to bring Elizabeth's killer(s) to justice is all-consuming. He stares at her photos with horrifying intensity, as if he believes doing so will actually point to a solution. Not only does this put extra strain on Kay, it also puts extra strain on Bucky; he now has to continue the case alone, and with little to go on. Questioning a handful of other aspiring actresses is all he initially has.<br /><br />But after a while, his investigating yields to some possible leads. For one, he discovers Elizabeth's screen test-footage as well as her underground nudie film (both of which are effectively uncomfortable to watch). But more importantly, he discovers a high-class lesbian nightclub. Here enters Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), an edgy Hollywood socialite who once had a pretty intimate encounter with Elizabeth Short (heightened by the fact that one looks very similar to the other). Linscott is portrayed as a sultry femme fatale caricature: over the top, yet completely appropriate, especially since the character has more than a couple of skeletons in her closet (as does everyone else in this film).<br /><br />She predictably gets close with Bucky as he attempts to extract information. He eventually meets the rest of her family during an interestingly choreographed dinner scene. Her father, Emmet (John Kavanagh), is a wealthy construction tycoon. Her teenage sister, Martha (Rachel Miner), enjoys drawing (and wait until you see what she makes for Bucky). Her mother, Ramona (Fiona Shaw) is perpetually loaded with medication and alcohol, so much so that every word out of her mouth is a slurred rambling. It's this character in particular that adds an unexpected dimension to the film. At first, the audience sees her as mere comedy relief. But as the crucial details gradually reveal themselves, her role veers further and further away from humorous. It gets worse when some shocking family secrets are brought to light.<br /><br />How does this all connect with Lee? With Bucky? With Kay? With Elizabeth Short? I'm still asking myself these questions, despite the fact that a solution is given. With so many subplots, it's easy to understand why "The Black Dahlia" is difficult to fully absorb. But a film of such style and precision has to be given credit; it's a fascinating story that delves into the deepest, most disturbed recesses of the human mind. All the while, it maintains the best elements of Film Noir and paperback detective stories without unintentionally becoming a parody. I can't say whether or not this film in any way, shape, or form accurately reinterprets the facts of the Elizabeth Short murder, but to be perfectly honest, I don't really care. The story was made to stand on its own, much like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "The Amityville Horror," or "An American Haunting" (all of which are said to be inspired by "true" events). If all you historical purists out there find this unacceptable, then I'm sorry I wasted your time with this review.</p></body></html>

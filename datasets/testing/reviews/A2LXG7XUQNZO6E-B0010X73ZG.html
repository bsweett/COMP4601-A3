I believe a 5 star film is a film that will be discussed, analyzed and even debated years after we're long gone. A 5 star rating, to me, doesn't mean a film has to be perfect, it just means it's about as entertaining and as well-crafted as you can get for that particular subject matter. That being said, imagine my surprise after watching this when I blurted out, to nobody in particular, "That's a 5 star movie. No doubt about it."<br /><br />The Mist is the undisputed heavyweight champion of Stephen King adaptations bar none. Not too many years ago I was convinced nothing could top Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption until I saw 1408, which I felt was the best King work I'd ever seen on the big screen, but I was wrong on all counts. The Mist takes the prize as the best King work I've EVER seen adapted for cinema. It had everything a viewer could ask for including a hero, a villain, a conspiracy, creatures, gore, love, anger, hate, innocence and even human sacrifice!<br /><br />Thomas Jane isn't what I'd call an acting powerhouse but he is good at what he does and some of his best roles are the "everyman" character. I think he shined even more in this film considering the large majority of the cast in this were relatively unknown and therefore incapable of upstaging Jane and chewing the scenes he was meant to chew. I think the only other person that was able to match Jane's intensity was Marcia Gay Harden as the head honcho religious nut.<br /><br />I've heard quite a few people mention that some of the CG featured here wasn't as great as it probably could have been and I would have to agree to an extent but it's nothing intolerable, just a few small issues here and there. Aside from that there are all sorts of amazing monsters and disgusting gore to entertain fans. I highly recommend this film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="from the makers of possibly the worst movie ever made..."></head><body><p>...comes arguably the best zombie movie ever made. 28 weeks later is great in almost every way shape and form, blowing the god awful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a> out of the water. The first ten minutes alone were scarier and more action packed than 28 days in and of themselves (and let's not forget that in those opening 10 minutes we see more infected than we see in the entire first movie).<br /><br />Set 28 weeks (duh) after the original infection the US army has declared England free of infection and has begun moving British refugees back into the deserted wasteland that once was the British Isles. A kid named Andy and his older sister are the first children to arrive back in England and are happily reunited with their dad who managed to survive the original outbreak by being a really big wimp (really, you will hate this guy). the army has managed to set up a safe zone, where civies can live (almost) normal lives while, while at the same time continue to clean up the thousands of dead bodies lying all over the place in London (by the way, where did all these bodies come from when in 28 days latter we didn't see any in the streets at all?).<br /><br />Anyway, after about thirty minutes of gawking at all the dead bodies and military build up, we finally get introduced to the infected. A woman is found that carries the rage virus but doesn't suffer from its symptoms. Hurray, now they can finally find a cure for the virus. But... of course the virus manages to break out, call it bad security and horrible luck, but it does. At this point the movie really starts getting good, with tons of gore (oh my god, there wasn't anywhere near this much gore in the first movie), action, and scare your pants off moments. The infection spread like wild fire, and this time WE GET TO SEE IT. Remember in 28 days when that one guy that gets chopped up by the black girl explains how he was in a crowd when the infection spread and that the only way to get out was to go up? Remember? Well that scene is played out in this movie and boy is it creepy. Its great to see how one infected person, just one, can infect hundreds, no, thousands of people. It spreads so fast that in a matter of hours the military is forced to fire bomb the city and use chemical weapons to stop its spread.<br /><br />If you like zombie movies than you will love this one. It beats Romero by a mile (blasphemy I know, but just see the movie) and puts to shame everything else. Finally I got what I wanted to see, a zombie infection as it spread. No other zombie movie I can think of showed the spread of the plague anywhere NEAR as good as this one did. One minute everything is all hunky dory and the next BOOM, everyone's dead, and all because of one person. Wow.<br /><br />So if you like action, see this movie. If you like gore, see this movie. If you don't get embarrassed when others hear you gasp in horror, see this movie (and if you do, just see if by yourself). This is the zombie movie of the century, beating out the Dawn of the Dead remake, Romero's Land of the Dead, and the first 28 movie. I would even go so far as to say it's the best zombie movie ever, period. so if you like zombies, and I'm sure you do if your reading this review, than drop whatever it is your doing and go see 28 weeks latter now. I know the first movie was trash, but this one isn't. if you read this review, please leave a comment.</p></body></html>

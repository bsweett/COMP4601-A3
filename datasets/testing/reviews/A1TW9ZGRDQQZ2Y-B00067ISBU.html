But have no fear because the movie is really good. No other actor I can think of is more perfect for this part and I was happy to finally see him get a starring role in a movie, rather than the side-kick or bad-guy part of norm. His eyes, voice, and sarcastic personality really shine through all those layers of awesome make-up. Rick Baker did the make-up effects and that alone promises greatness in that department. The love story between Hellboy and Liz was funny and sweet, not sappy like the one in Spiderman. Everyone cast seemed like they fit the part, especially John Hurt (the mentor) and Liz (Selma Blair). The special effects for the most part are great, with only a few scenes standing out as just average (the underwater egg hunt & the blue fire). All in all, I had a blast with the action scenes and remained interested in the plot, which was fresh and new for this type of movie. Not being one who has read the comics, I still haven't figured out all of the plot or who some of the bad characters were suppose to be. But since I plan on seeing it again real soon, I will be sure to pay more attention to the story rather than just the overwhelming visuals. This is easily one of the better Super-Hero films of the last few years! "Second Date...No Tongue."-Hellboy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Misunderstood Shyamalan Film"></head><body><p>Their are many theories as to why this film failed to have the impact that "The Sixth Sense" did with audiences.  I will be the first to admit that there was no way that M. Night Shyamalan could have caught lightning in the bottle with this film.  "The Sixth Sense" was a phenomenon and audience expectations were too high for this film.  I remember this film had a targeted Thanksgiving release date and it was probably rushed to theatres before the kinks in the story could have been ironed out.  It's obvious from the get-go where the story was going and the abrupt ending didn't help matters.  All that aside, I like this film alot.  Shyamalan is a master at mood and developing tension and it is apparent in this film.  Shyamalan does not so much copy the masters(Hitchcock and Spielberg) but pay homage to them.  Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give superb performances here.  This is a good time to revisit this film now that it is divorced from the hype and expectations that it engendered on it's initial release.</p></body></html>

To have all that info and put it all together in a way to not just keep the viewers attention but have us become mildly obsessed ourselves for the 2 hour and 37 minute run time that for me flew by.<br />At first I analyzed Zodiac a bit, when Robert Downey Jr.'s character Paul Avery let's Jake Gyllenhall's Robert Graysmith in on the fact that maybe the Zodiac wasn't responsible for all killings being linked to him, and he said to Robert you look disappointed.  I thought to myself here is a lonely divorced guy bored with his job and a serial killer is filling some sort of void and for him he sees adventure.  I abandoned that though, definitely all the crazies pretending to be the Zodiac obviously are desperate troubled people but I don't think Robert Graysmith.  In my opinion this bored divorce e saw this as a way to do something in his life, something important and make a difference, the light bulb went off for Graysmith when he again visits Downey Jr's character, which i felt was a less trippy version of Johnny Depp's character in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and he say's to him what have you done?<br />The movie has great suspense and the killings are not bloody but done in an eerie effective way.  Zodiac is also witty and funny when it is supposed to be.  For example when Paul Avery (downey) gets a Halloween card via our killer everyone at the station wear buttons that say I'm not Paul Avery including him.  This is again a must see.</p></body></html>

Inspiration dabs of Tony Perkins [as Norman 'u know who'with that killer smile] and Jerry Lewis [the gait!]  [This boy is literally rail-thin - without being emaciated - defining Spartan life as luxurious when we discover his circumstances].<br /><br />The look, texture, feel and humor of the film [although in English] is essentially French, and what a period of devine filth - one can only but imagine the stench of the big cities during summer, although Veni .... [another story]<br /><br />The girls have their special glow - especially the first accidental 'apricot' seller victim and the final fatal attraction.<br /><br />We're not quite sure why the Academy chose to overlook this exquisite film, but then again the subject matter might have left the members somewhat stunned?  Whislaw has our votes as Best Actor, followed by Hoffman and Rickman as supporting. yet very pivotal characters.<br /><br />Wave upon wave of brilliant images flow over the audience, the editing, art direction, costumes, lighting - everything meshes and comes together.<br />This concept is so picture perfect one would expect Valmont to walk into the perfumarie, as well as characters from all the recent period movies as well as Mozart or at least Salieri [snooping for ungents].<br /><br />*Hoffman is delightful as the eccentric master perfumer living in his 'lively' little maison on the bridge - fairietailish in concept vs. Alan Rickman's chateau on Grasse [which brings new meaning to the hidden dangers of a maze  .... or a contemporary mall .... during rush hour .... or a crowded birthday party ...]<br /><br />*[Wouldn't it be incredible to see him as Tartuffe on film?  What a delicious sense of comedy this actor has].<br /><br />ALAN RICKMAN is always brilliant in his creations, this is an intelligent and also tortured character.  Rickman never disappoints - is always spot on with his unique choices.<br /><br />It's a very seductive movie ..... and quite imformative about the 'perfume industry' - worth more than just a sniff.<br /><br />...by the way ...... another taste-treat would be the big screen version of "THE COOK" [no, not the other one about "The Cook, The Wife ...etc." - this was once filmed as "Something for Evebody" - was it?  Didn't quite work..]</p></body></html>

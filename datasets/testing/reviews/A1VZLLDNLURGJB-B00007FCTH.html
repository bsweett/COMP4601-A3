The movie certainly was technically well done, but what helped it the most was the story.  Not to excuse his behavior, but Kane tried to control everyone while trying to make them love him because he had no control when he lost his parents as a child.  The mysterious "rosebud" was the name of his sled which he repeated several times in the course of the film at times of stress. He also recalled his most happy time of life which probably occurred just prior to being sent away by his mother.  He was playing in the snow just before he was traumatized by being forced to go away with a total stranger. The scene depicted in the glass ball of a snow scene he obsessively fondled and the word "rosebud" were his last thoughts at death.  With a lifetime of adult memories as a powerful, wealthy man and the lost love of a beautiful woman, what did he think about at the moment of death?  I think it was his lost youth and family that "rosebud" represented.</p></body></html>

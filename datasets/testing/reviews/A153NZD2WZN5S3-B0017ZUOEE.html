<meta name="summary" content="Movie of Nothing"></head><body><p>As any film on unexplained or horror, a story of former orphan's plan to renovate her former closed orphanage building into a family-run seaside hotel, is lacking of any practical logic and far remote from reality as everything else occurred during run of plot rather psycho-delusive than worth being created at all.<br /><br />There are much worse movies of such gender and if some wasted time and money to watch, it is good for producers anyway.</p></body></html>

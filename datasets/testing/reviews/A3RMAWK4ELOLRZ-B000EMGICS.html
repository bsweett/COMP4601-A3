When there, Sarah finds out from her grandmother Katharine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine) that a guy named Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) slept with Sarah's mother and grandmother.  After the wedding, instead of going back to New York, Sarah stays in Pasadena and meets up with Beau.  Beau confirms with her that he did sleep with her mother and grandmother.  Sarah finds out that her mother, who died when she was young, had had an affair with Beau Burroughs before getting married to her dad (as a last fling!).  Beau intern did it with the grandmother, and now granddaughter (Sarah).<br /><br />I had to watch this movie twice because it didn't make sense to me.  But overall it was a good movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classic detective movie!"></head><body><p>Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) is your typical San Fransisco detective who just lost his partner Archer (Jerome Cowen). Beautiful dame Brigid O'Shaunghnessy (Mary Astor) walks into his office and wants protection for two criminals such as Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jr.) and Kasper Guttman (Sydney Greenstreet) would do anything possess a priceless object called The Maltese Falcon.<br /><br />Brilliant timeless crime classic that is also a remake of a 1931 crime movie that was very loose to the classic novel only done better here. During after the success of "Casablanca", Bogart made another memorable as hell role known as Sam Spade and this is the directorial debut of John Houston which earned him some oscars for this remarkable motion picture. Peter Lorre here gives off his best performance as you can see this movie with the character he played was an inspiration to Ren in the popular cartoon "Ren and Stimpy" with his famous "You stupid, you bloated idiot!" line. What also works is the brilliant performances of everyone else even the lovely Astor who is stunning, the excellent black and white photography and the storytelling as it's faithful to it's source than 1931's attempt giving us a winner.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is stunning for an old movie it really has improved picture and good sound quality such as commentary, featurettes, newsreel, short, 2 classic looney tunes cartoons, trailers and audio-only bonus such as the adaptation of the book from radio show that includes Edward G. Robinson with 2 of the original stars of the film.</p></body></html>

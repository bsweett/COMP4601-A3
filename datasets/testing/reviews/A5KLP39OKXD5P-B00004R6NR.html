Excellent direction, good editing and a well chosen cast makes the film worth a watch. The film hasn't lost its spice in all these years, its entertains me today as much as it did then. I had always wanted the movie on Dvd and finally glad to get it. The dvd is perfect with great picture quality and sound and has some interesting features like 'the making', etc. In other words, if you loved "Jurassic Park" wholeheartedly, this is the Dvd for your collection.</p></body></html>

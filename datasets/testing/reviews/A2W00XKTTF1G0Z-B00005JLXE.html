One of the main and most interesting characters gets the kicked out the picture half way through. Conceptually it kept close to the original comic but it lacked the story. The film's visual style was also a little confusing in parts. It is one of those films that tells the origins by starting with an event at the beginning that isn't explained until the end. Very disappointing when you realize it was nothing special.<p>Directed by Mark Stephen Johnson (Jack Frost, Ghostrider) the film is a little slow and dark in the beginning. The story doesn't start to get interesting until the main temptress played by Jennifer Garner (Pearl Harbor, Catch Me If You Can) shows up and has some great fighting sequences.<p>The most interesting character is Collin Farrell (S.W.A.T., Phone Booth) interpretation as Bullseye. He is exciting and evil and really seems to be the only one who is having fun in the film. He is energetic and exciting.<p>The story is that of the making of the Vigilante known as Daredevil. The beginnings are shallow and short and the accident not really explained much and the father is played by David Keith (Office And A Gentlemen, Firestarter) who gives a short but meaningful performance.<p>Now as for Ben Afflect (Sum of All Fears, Pearl harbor, Armageddon) as Daredevil, he was week. He was more interesting as the alter-ego Matt Murdock. Even that was a a little shallow. <p>Overall it is an okay rental movie and certainly watchable on cable - but nothing to write home about. I think they rushed the script to ride the tales of the Brilliant production of Spider-Man. That was good writing and production. 5-20-03</p></body></html>

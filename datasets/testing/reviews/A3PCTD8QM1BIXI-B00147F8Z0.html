<meta name="summary" content="Another by the numbers sequel"></head><body><p>AvP-R is another by the number sequels that has cool special effects ut easily could have been released direct to DVD instead of coming to the big screen. The film has no A-list stars to speak and script that is very weak. However the film does supply action and a good scare or two.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Maltese Falcon (Three-Disc Special Edition)"></head><body><p>The Maltese Falcon (Three-Disc Special Edition)~ Humphrey Bogart is one of the best detective movies of all time. The character Sam Spade is a legend and every detective ever since has been modeled after this. Bogart is absolutely stupendous in his role and he should have won some kind of award for it. I might even say that the academy award would have been justified for this movie. The music is minimal but it is very effective. The script is very well written and I would have to say it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></body></html>

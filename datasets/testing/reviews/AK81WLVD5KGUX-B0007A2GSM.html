If you didn't grow up reading comic books, you'll think this one is much ado about nothing. But if you still have a box of Marvel comics stashed away somewhere ('in your heart' will do), you'll love this film. Kids will like it too, but don't mistake it for a 'children's film' just because it's animated and has superheroes in it.<br /><br />The eye-popping animation is Pixar's finest to date, and that's saying a lot. The voice characterizations are consistent and believable throughout as well, especially (but not only) Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />The storyline is wildly, exuberantly inventive. There's lots of gentle spoofing of comic-book conventions, but it never descends into mockery; this film takes itself seriously, plays by its own rules, and delivers a surprisingly powerful story within those rules. Writer/director Brad Bird (of _Iron Giant_ fame) is obviously familiar with superhero comics in a way that only someone who loves them can be. (And the script passes the sternest test: it would have made a fine live-action movie too. In its way it's every bit as good as the _X-Men_ films.)<br /><br />The family's superpowers are, at a literal level, lifted directly from the comic-superhero world. But Bird puts them to sly metaphorical use as well, invoking well-known 'familial' archetypes: the super-strong dad, the pulled-every-which-way mom, the hyperkinetic little boy, the teenage daughter who turns invisible and isn't yet very good at putting up shields. Adults will enjoy this stuff if they notice it, but it's handled in such a way that everybody (including kids) will grok it intuitively whether they're consciously aware of it or not.<br /><br />The film doesn't moralize or preach, but its universe is one in which good and evil matter. To the extent that it has a moral, it's healthily individualistic and even anti-egalitarian; for example, the villain is motivated primarily by soul-deforming envy and resentment (and quite needlessly, since his own talents are clearly remarkable even though they're not superpowers). It shows genuine teamwork in action and doesn't confuse it with conformity or collectivism. It suggests very strongly that there's something wrong with refraining from displaying and using one's gifts just because not all other people share them. It illustrates that when heroes aren't permitted, the result is mediocrity.<br /><br />It may even stimulate older viewers to ask ourselves what _our_ special powers might be and whether _we've_ stopped exercising them (and if so, why); are we sure _our_ glory days are really over? Why, in short, did we put those comic books away? Have we forgotten why we liked them?<br /><br />You don't need me to tell you the plot; the other reviews have already done that. If you have an ounce of comicbookery in your soul, you'll love this grand, rollicking homage to the genre. See this one in the theater and _then_ buy it on DVD. Trust me.</p></body></html>

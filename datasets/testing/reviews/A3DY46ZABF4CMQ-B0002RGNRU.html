<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies of the past ten years!"></head><body><p>There hasn't been a movie ever since Pulp Fiction that has really made me watch with full attention not knowing what to expect in the next scene. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a genius form of storytelling.<br /><br />The movie is simply a love story but with an original plot and excellent performances by the two lead stars Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) and Kate Winslett (Titanic), Sunshine is an instant classic.<br /><br />The movie might be a little awkward, but the detailed direction of Michael Gondry gives you no excuse not to be able to follow along understanding what is going on. The film is about a shy man named Joel who meets an eccentric girl named Clementine (like the song!) and immediately they fall in love.<br /><br />Clementine's behavior takes a toll with Joel who begins distrusting her, so Clementine leaves him and erases him out of her memory with the help of Doctor Howard Mierzwiak, played by Oscar winner Tom Wilkinson. Joel goes crazy as a result and ends up at the same doctor's office to have his memory cleaned up of all memory of Clementine.<br /><br />Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind from here on. The essence of the picture is that Joel realizes, as his treasured memories of Clementine begin to fade away one after the other, that he still loves Clementine and attempts to get out of the procedure before it's too late.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is quite surprising in his dramatic, but funny, turn. A turn that will most definitely earn him Hollywood praise (and a golden statue!) in the future. Winslett, who was nominated for Best Actress for her work here, is incredibly convincing and proves to be perfect competition for Carrey.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is by far one of the best movies of the past ten years.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br /><br />A+</p></body></html>

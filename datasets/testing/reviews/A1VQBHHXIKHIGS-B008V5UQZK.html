<meta name="summary" content="My Big Fat Greek Wedding"></head><body><p>I'm  not known as a person who sits around watching romantic comedies. There's a reason for that. But I've shown this one to half a dozen classes and it hasn't grown stale. Witty dialogue, comic bits that work, and a fairly rapid pace that acknowledges we've seen this story before. The author didn't dumb it down, and the result is so universally appealing that I can show it to Chinese students and watch their shoulders shake with laughter. I can also see some weepies, which is always funny. Get this one and watch it when you want to relax.</p></body></html>

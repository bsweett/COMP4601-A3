This film stays with you, you can't help but think about it, it is that powerful. Heath Ledger is so good in this film that i almost forgot this is the same actor who made his acting debut in 10 things i hate about you. Jake Gylenhaal is wonderful as well, i loved him in the good girl and october sky. Their love for each other is so real and passionate, that i believed in this story from the getgo. Two actors pretending to be in love, they sure pulled it off effortlessly. Ang Lee's direction is so beautiful with the sheeps, it looks like a cloud floating in one swing. Gorgeous, intense, and courageous acting is what you will get when you engross yourself in this oscar-nominated film. I think it should have won best picture but some of the best films of all time never win. Rent this, buy it, it will leave a profound effect on you, highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

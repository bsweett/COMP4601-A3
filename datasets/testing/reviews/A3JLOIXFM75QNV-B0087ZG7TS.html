The characters really appeal to you, the acting is incredible, the imagery, lush and realistic. But then, it all falls apart. The middle and especially the end parts all feel disjointed, almost as if they were an entirely different film. Now, I love romantic, tragic dramas and was really excited to see it. But I must say, I left feeling dissapointed. I am not saying I was looking for a happy ending, or a grand conclusion, however, I was looking for a solid gut-wrenching, awful-in-a-good-way type of ending. And after it ended, I just didn't feel anything. I truly felt nothing for any of the characters after everything was said and done. I am giving this film 3 stars however, because I really loved the first part of the film, and the musical score is actually outstanding. Its one of the most beautiful scores in any film. Too bad the movie didn't really match it.</p></body></html>

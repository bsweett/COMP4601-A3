<meta name="summary" content="A great cast makes this a great movie"></head><body><p>Wild Hogs is a typical midlife crisis movie.  Four men, who have been friends for years and who suit up in leather and ride to the local bar and grill regularly to hang out, suddenly wonder what happened to their lives.  They all realize, one by one, that they've hit middle age and fallen into a rut, and they decide to take a cross country trip on their bikes to get out of it.<br /><br />This is one of the more entertaining movies I've seen in a while.  What made it for me, however, was not the plot or even the comedic moments but rather the excellent performances by a great cast.  John Travolta plays the cool-guy-in-a-midlife-crisis role perfectly, and Tim Allen pulls off his when-did-my-life-get-so-bland part flawlessly as well.  Throw in great performances by Martin Lawrence, a man desperate to get out from under his overbearing wife's thumb, and William H. Macy, a geek who hopes he can FINALLY do something that will make him cool, and you've got a great group of main characters.<br /><br />Macy's performance is probably the most surprisingly good of the bunch.  He's downright hilarious in this movie as the 'rebel nerd.'  And Ray Liotta is excellent as the villain, the antagonist who tries to refuse this group of "Wild Hogs" their right to ride on the grounds that they're not real bikers.<br /><br />This is a very funny movie and is sure to keep you entertained.  With a relatively unoriginal plot this may not have been a great film if not for the excellent cast, but these guys will have you cheering for the middle-aged suburbanite and longing for the open road yourself.</p></body></html>

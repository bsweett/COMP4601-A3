<meta name="summary" content="Not as Good as the Original"></head><body><p>The original Manchurian Candidate, starring Frank Sinatra, is an excellent thriller, one that had me scared for months.  I was looking forward to the remake.  Unfortunately, while the film holds your attention for the duration, and is a worthy effort, the movie is eminently forgettable.  The chills don't last.<br /><br />Meryl Streep does not play evil well.  The insinuation of incest between her and her grown son is just embarrassing and takes away from the story.<br /><br />Stick with the original for a classic yet timely political conspiracy thriller.</p></body></html>

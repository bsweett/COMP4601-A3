<meta name="summary" content=""Super" Fun"></head><body><p>I went into the theatre really not expecting alot, after seeing the trailers of the movie I found that it was very limited and honestly the only real thing that I knew about "Returns" was that Kevin Spacey plays the notorious villian, Lex Luther.<br /><br />Bryan Singer obviously took an advantage of his large budget of - 260 million and really put it to outstanding use, the special effects, visuals and Technology was obviously advanced from the beginning credits. I would say that it is up there with Peter Jackson's "King Kong" and George Lucas's "Star Wars: Episode 3".<br /><br />The only flaw that I really noticed from this film was the acting - not that it was bad but I thought that lacked a certian Chistopher Reeve. It's not that Brandon Routh was a "Bad" Superman, but I thought that he lacked the heart and overall emotion that Christopher Reeve brought the charactor. I thought that they might have brought in a more experienced actor to play such an important role, but I have to admit that he sure did LOOK like Superman. I think that I am just such a Reeve fan that I would be saying this about anyone who played the part. I just think that it was a hard path for Routh to follow after Reeve had the uniform on for so long. Other than that the acting by everyone else was by far up to par,Kate Bosworth played a very good Lois Lane, Parker Posey was absolutly flawless in playing Kitty and of corse Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was a perfect fit. Even the smaller roles were very well played. Overall though I do believe that this last installment of the Superman film series does lack the heart that it showed in the first couple of films.<br /><br />Overall the story was just like any Super Hero movie should be, you know how they go. Villian wants to destroy the world, good guy fights bad guy to SAVE the world, good guy wins. So I just told you the VERY short version, the actual version is about two hours and thirty minutes long. Every Minute is worth watching.<br /><br />This very well could be the Biggest Blockbuster film of the summer. You dont want to miss "Returns" it is alot of fun to watch on the big screen.<br /><br />P.S This movie, though PG-13 is not rough what so ever and it is most definatly appropriate for Children of about 6 or 7 and above. It is possibly the lightest PG-13 film that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

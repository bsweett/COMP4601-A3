<meta name="summary" content="Personal power, not religion, was the basis for this 12th century holy war."></head><body><p>I've had a stuffy nose and head cold all week and I didn't want to watch anything too serious.  Some people would reach for a romantic comedy at this time.  Not me.  To me, there is nothing like a silly swashbuckler with a big theme, huge battle scenes, and a bit of romance.  This 2005 film, Kingdom of Heaven, met that goal perfectly.  All I had to do was sit back and watch heroes and villains and lots of pomp in a rather contrived story about good and evil.  And whether the film is historically accurate or really happened this way makes little difference.  After all, the only reason I was watching it was so I could sit back, relax and kill a few hours before going to bed.<br /><br />The film is set in the 12th century and it's about Muslims and Christians fighting for control of Jerusalem.  Orlando Bloom is cast as the young blacksmith in France who is the illegitimate son of a knight, played by Liam Neeson.  He teaches his son to fence and to be honorable and then gets murdered.  The young man now has his quest in front of him.  He will go to Jerusalem and fight for the forces of good.  Of course there are challenges along the way - like getting shipwrecked in desert (yes, the desert) and saving the life of an Arab who we all know will show up later in the film.  The king of Jerusalem is Christian and is trying to keep peace in the land.  However, he is dying of leprosy and soon there will be a fight for his throne. He has a beautiful sister though, played by Eva Green.  Alas, though, she is married to a Christian bad guy.  And after Orlando Bloom falls in love with her,  he refuses to have her divorce the bad guy and marry him because he feels it is wrong.  She's a terrible actress but she has beautiful blue eyes and wears great costumes.  The one romantic scene surely could pass any censor.  Maybe that's because the producers wanted to attract a Muslim audience.<br /><br />Anyway, the film plays out as I expected.  It's very politically correct and tries to show that the fighting was more about personal power than religion.  Jeremy Irons is cast as the good king's advisor.  He's a good actor as were most of the others.  There was good cinematography too.  But the battle scenes were very similar to every other battle scene I've ever seen.  And the story seemed to lack an electric charge.  I did like it though because it kept my interest.  But it really is boring.  So don't bother.</p></body></html>

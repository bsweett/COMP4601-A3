<meta name="summary" content="Stupid, Inane, Worthless, Crass, Crude & Over-The-Top Big-Screen Version Of A Comic-Book Character, Turned Television Series."></head><body><p>Note: I have NOT seen the entire movie, nor do I intend to. I just saw the last 20-30 minutes on TV.<br /><br />From what I've seen of this film, it's really bad. Though I know next to nothing about the character, except that it was later made into a popular television series starring Van Williams and Bruce Lee-launching Mr. Lee into superstardom herre in the U.S.-I can say that this movie does NOT do justice to the series, though I remember little about it. My idea of the character, be it right or wrong, is that it's supposed to be a straight-up story with absolutely little to no comedy (and if there is humor, it should NOT be crass, crude or vulgar humor), no cursing and minimal, non-graphic violence with a solid story that has plenty of action, suspense and drama. And absolutely NOTHING over-the-top, ala this idiot Rogen or Robin Williams (though he mostly does comedies and when he does drama, he's strictly serious, which is the mark of a good actor). I do NOT recommend this movie. This is a film that screams, "REMAKE." But it HAS TO BE a good one, faithful to the character.</p></body></html>

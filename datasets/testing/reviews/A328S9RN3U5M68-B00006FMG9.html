<meta name="summary" content="The Trilogy is Complete"></head><body><p>For the past several years we have been treated to the bizarre tales of Hannibal Lector.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (Part 2 of the Trilogy by Thomas Harris) surprised the public with a formidable tale well acted by Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster.  That film was excellent.  The second installment HANNIBAL (Part 3 of the Trilogy) was a sequel to SILENCE and while it veered a bit to the excesses of Hollywood it was still a good film with Julianne Moore stepping in very well for the Jody Foster role of Clarice.  Now RED DRAGON (Part 1 of the Trilogy) completes the appetite for the tale of horror of the life and misdeeds of Hannibal Lector.  In many ways this is the strongest of the three films, due in part to the fine performances by Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, as well as Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Some liberties were taken with the original story, but this incorporation of what we already have learned about Hannibal only adds to the spectrum.  A well cast, edge of the seat thriller, RED DRAGON is  a must if you've followed the other parts.</p></body></html>

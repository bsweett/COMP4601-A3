<meta name="summary" content="It&#65533;s All Eye Candy"></head><body><p>"Charlie's Angels" brings the 70's cop chick thriller to the big screen.  Overall, the movie is lean on storyline but BIG on eye candy, be it the special effects or of course, the three lovely leading ladies.  While the movie may leave some to be desired the DVD features are abundant in solid extras.<p>THE MOVIE:<p>The Story:<p>Natalie, Dylan and Alex (Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu respectively) are secret undercover operatives for a mysterious benefactor named Charlie.  Together the girls try to balance their undercover lives and normal lives.  This time around the girls must find a kidnapped computer scientist and keep the powerful technology he's developed from falling into the wrong hands.  The girls go under deep cover (under various disguises and in various locales) to get to the bottom of the case using both their sex appeal and their kung fu to take out the bad guys and save the day.<p>The Cool Stuff:<p>While the storyline and storytelling are easy to lose track of (the movie moves at breakneck speed), you should be really entertained by this flick.  The various locales, costumes and situations the girls get themselves into are hilarious.  The action sequences (very much Matrix and Hong Kong Kung-Fu inspired) are passable.  Overall, the film is very much enjoyable if not blow away.  The movie works as an action-comedy flick.<p>Best Scenes:<p>1. The Matrix-inspired alley fight<p>2. Massage therapy scene<p>Movie Grade:  3 stars out of 5.  Decent action and comedy.  So-so story.<p>THE DVD:<p>Where the movie is just alright, the DVD itself more than makes this a great viewing experience with a bounty of extras.  Among the goodies included here are:<p>1. Commentary - always insightful<p>2. "Getting G'd Up" - 6 minute feature on the director McG.<p>3. "The Master and the Angels" - 7 minute feature on how the girls trained for the fight scenes plus wire work.<p>4. "Welcome to Angel World" - 4 minute feature about the movie in general<p>5. "Angelic Attire" - 3 minute feature on all the costumes the girls wore.<p>6. "Angelic Effects" - 6 minute feature on all the cool CGI effects.<p>7. "Wired Angels" - 2 minute feature on the alley fight<p>8. 3 Deleted Scenes<p>9. Outtakes - this is basically the video that roled during credits, w/o the credits<p>10. 2 music videos:  "Independent Woman" by Destiny's Child and "Charlie's Angels 2K" by Apollo Four Forty<p>11. Cast and Crew Bios<p>12. Trailers:  The theatrical and teaser trailer plus trailers for other movies.<p>THE VERDICT:<p>Overall the movie makes a decent rental.  The action, FX and comedy are decent.  Indeed, the movie is probably way more comedy than it is an action thriller.  Fans of the women should be pleased with the movie (chicks who kick butt, oh yeah!!!).  The movie isn't a total blow away, but it's fun.<p>The DVD extras definitely put this over the top.  For myself, the features were probably way more interesting than the movie itself.  Again, the features are a great insight into Hollywood and how films are made.<p>Final Grades:<p>Movie:  3 stars<br />Extras:  5 stars<p>Total:  4 stars<p>Recommended</p></body></html>

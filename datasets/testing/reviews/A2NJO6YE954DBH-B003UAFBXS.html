<meta name="summary" content="Elvis and JFK take on a soul-sucking Egyptian mummy"></head><body><p>The idea here is quite simple. Elvis (Bruce Campbell) is not dead; he switched over with an Elvis impersonator and was living a carefree life (as an Elvis impersonator) when he broke his hip. Now he is in a rest home in East Texas, concerned with an abnormality on a particular part of his anatomy, and hobbling around on a walker. But then giant scarab beetles start showing up and he learns from John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis), who is also in the rest home, having been dyed black by the assassination conspiracy, that there is an ancient Egyptian soul sucking mummy named Bubba Ho-Tep killing off the members of their less than happy little home. <p>Is it really Elvis? After all, it is not really JFK. But then there really is a Bubba Ho-Tep, so at least it is a fifty-fifty proposition. If only there had not been that barbeque accident that destroyed the only proof Elvis had in his possession about the switch. But the important thing is that this 2002 film works either way. When Elvis talks about his regrets over running out on Priscilla and Lisa Marie or about how bad his films were, there is some resonance. Besides, there is something heroic about the King heading out to do battle with a mummy puffing along behind his walker while JFK zips along in his motorized wheelchair. <p>Campbell's performance as the aged and infirmed Elvis avoids caricature; the accent is never laid on too thick, which is key. Like the short story by Joe R. Lansdale on which it is based, this film from director Don Coscarelli has an affection for the character of Elvis. The point was not that Elvis disappeared, but that by pretending to be an Elvis impersonator he could perform without having to put up with the rest of the circus (it reminds me of the Elvis from his television comeback special, where he sits in a circles with the guys playing his guitar and singing his music, long before the became the bloated figure in the white star spangled jump suit). <p>You keep thinking that &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; is going to be a camp horror movie, but it does not go this way. Yes, this film is actually on the conservative side of things like &quot;Men in Black,&quot; which had tongues more prominently in cheeks. But then these two old codgers have lots of problems besides the soul-sucking mummy and this film ends with a knock down drag out fight between our heroes and the title character. Campbell and Davis take their characters serious, as does the film, and that is why it works as well as it does, which is a lot better than you would ever think. At the very least, you have to celebrate the film's audacity and say, as would the King: &quot;Thank you. Thank you very much.&quot;<br /><br /> As you would expect the extras on this DVD are above average. You have two commentary tracks, the first by Coscarelli and Campbell, with the second being by &quot;The King.&quot; Lansalde reads from his original story and you also get theatrical trailers and TV spots, deleted scenes, and several featurettes.</p></body></html>

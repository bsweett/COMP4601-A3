I have to give the Director credit for coming up with a logical plot to link Predator and Alien together.  Humans in this movie bring it home to the meaning, "at the wrong place, at the wrong time".  The entourage of explorers entered into the "forbidden zone" is an alibi to add to the headcounts and to keep the movie rolling along.  I really have to say that the nature of this movie is to make money and everything seems to be well-thought off by the studio.  One of the reviewers said it well that the age is pushed down to thirteen so that it would entice more audience and thus, profitability.  Then, you think of the additions of cast such as Lance Henriksen, who is there to entice and appease the original Alien's fan and then, there's Raoul Bova, arguably one of the more famous Italian actor and is certainly there to appeal to the European market.  Sanaa, the African American lead character and a younger and more dynamic version of Ripley plays quite an okay role but she doesn't have Sigourney's charisma and weight to carry the movie upon her shoulder.  Anderson, the director is good in making a straight up movie and he doesn't have the gravita of James Cameron, the moody appeal of David Fincher and Ridley Scott.  In the interview, he said it himself that the earlier versions of Alien and Predator franchises are classics and the last thing he wants to do is to bastardising the franchise and because of that, his reservation can only produce a half baked and unsatisfactory AVP movie.  His poster shots and the close up shots of Alien and Predator hitting on with one another are commendable but they don't make the total sum of the whole movie.  Overall, a could have been movie.  I find the making and the interview more intriguing than the movie itself.  However, on a wet and cold day, it's quite a nice way to spend an afternoon all alone.  Commendable effort.</p></body></html>

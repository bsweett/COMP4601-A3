<meta name="summary" content="Check your head Mr. Travis Bickle"></head><body><p>Travis Bickle is a cab driver. A cab driver because that is all he can do. In New York he feels the heat. He does not like what he sees in the back of his cab. He listens to it, and sees it, but he does not like it. He does not like it because everything is false. He believes that the world is not a good place. He believes that the America he lives in is one big fake. Maybe this is because Travis does not do anything more than drive a cab, but soon he will change all that. He will change it all for the better.<p>Travis is a man of morals. Travis is a taxi driver. Travis drives his taxis at night because he prefers that. Travis wants to do more but Travis does not want another job. Travis is not happy with what he does but it is all that he can do. Travis sees a woman who he likes. She is working for a Presidential candidate. Travis stalks her. Travis meets her. Travis does what anyone else would do when they go out with a girl. He takes her to see a blue movie.<p>Travis is dumped. Travis does not understand why. This is all further proof that everything is wrong about America. Travis sees a way to change all that. <p>This is the world according to Travis. A world that Travis will pack some heat with. Travis will have his revenge on them all. Travis will show them who is who and what is what. Travis will practice his lines in front of the mirror for that final confrontation that will show the world who he is and what is right and what is wrong.<p>"You talkin' to me?"<p>No one will stop Travis from completing his new found objective. If they do he will find another way to solve it all. The problem is not with Travis it is with the world. Travis knows he can make a difference. Travis will go out and do what nobody else will do. Travis will be the hero in the end... you'll see... oh yes you will...<p>*This is simply one of the all-time great classics about urban paranoia, isolation and redemption. De Niro practically holds the whole film on his own from start to finish. The ending is still one of the most shocking endings you will ever see. This is A+ drama with powerhouse acting. Unmissable.*</p></body></html>

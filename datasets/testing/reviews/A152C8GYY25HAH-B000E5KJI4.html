It has all the right moves in the epic area - great battles, great sets, etc. On the human scale, it succeeds barely at all. Still, it has an overall grandeur and sweep that is both entertaining and interesting. It succeeds in spite of its flaws.<br /><br />In the great epics - from "The Ten Commandments" to "Spartacus" to "Gladiator" - there is a balance between great battles for great causes and the love between a man and a woman.<br /><br />"Troy" doesn't succeed on the human level. The legend is that the Greek Paris [Orlando Bloom] took Helen of Troy [Diane Kruger] away from her husband, the King [Brian Cox], which caused the Trojan War. But nothing in the relationship between Paris and Troy suggests a great passion that would cause a great war. The subplot about the great warrior Achilles' [Brad Pitt] love of a Trojan priestess is much more involving, but it hardly explains reasons for the war.</p></body></html>

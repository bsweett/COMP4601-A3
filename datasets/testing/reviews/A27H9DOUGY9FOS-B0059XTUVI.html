<meta name="summary" content="Streep Makes A Fine Thatcher But This Bio-Pic Tells You Almost Nothing About Her"></head><body><p>Love her or loathe her, there is no denying that Margaret Thatcher is a subject worthy of a grand bio-pic treatment. She is a one-of-a-kind historical figure and her story is both epic and controversial. Hearing that one of the screen's living legends, Meryl Streep, was going to take on this complicated and powerful woman: it was like a dream pairing! So much story to tell! And yet, in a bizarre choice, the screenplay of "The Iron Lady" tells us almost nothing. At best, I thought the film had the potential to really dig into the heart of what made Thatcher tick. At worst, I thought the film might be a Cliff's Notes journey through the highs and lows of Thatcher's reign. And yet, for me, there is so little actual content that I'm absolutely speechless. Nothing is put into context. This gives you almost no idea of Thatcher's career, her family life, her politics, or England's history. Instead, the movie focuses on a retired Thatcher speaking to her deceased husband (an always welcome Jim Broadbent) and reflecting back at random moments in her life. I have NEVER seen a biographical movie that has left me so unconnected with ANYTHING having to do with its subject matter! I know that's a big statement, but absolutely how I feel.<br /><br />I remember all the previews of "The Iron Lady" with Streep really burning up the screen. When Streep faces down her adversaries in those previews and proclaims that she's had to fight every day of her life, it's a sweepingly dramatic moment. When that scene finally appears in the movie, I literally laughed out loud. Why? Because up to that point, the film had shown us nothing to make me believe it was true. We never know how Thatcher started in politics, how or why she achieved early success, how she was even considered for higher positioning, or anything at all that made her noteworthy as an up-and-coming political figure. Instead, the most background we get is that she's a shopkeeper's daughter. Then how did she get involved in politics? At one point, many years into her reign as Prime Minister, her closest advisors (and they are all interchangeable without one second's thought to developing them as characters) sneer that she's just the aforementioned "shopkeeper's daughter" in her presence. Really? It's patently absurd. She's one of the most powerful women in the world at this point with decades of leadership under her. Years fly by, sometimes people like Thatcher, sometimes they don't. You can't really care, because the screenplay is so thin. The only historical moment that gets the least bit of explanation or screen time is the Falkland Islands.<br /><br />Streep, though, does an uncanny impersonation. Oh, the movie that could have been made! She picked up her third Oscar (the first since 1982's Sophie's Choice, WOW!) and her make-up man received a golden statuette as well. But rarely has such greatness been expended for so little pay-off. I feel like I am exactly the target audience for "The Iron Lady" and I was so frustrated by its presentation. In all truth, I'd give this picture only one star for missing everything that made Thatcher such a noteworthy historical leader. But for Streep and Broadbent, I'll add one. An enormous missed opportunity! KGHarris, 4/12.</p></body></html>

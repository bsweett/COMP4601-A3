It also featured the Borg, while they were still cool and menacing - before they were made absolutely pathetic and neutered by the Voyager series which I think was the worst of the newer Treks, even worse than Enterprise.<br /><br />Anyhow, the premise is your classic time travel to save the Earth from having its past altered. Of course, it did seem silly, that the borg would go to all that trouble when technically, they should be able to take Earth quite easily if they really wanted to.<br /><br />Still, the story of first contact is great cannon wise, because it shows the first time humans meet the vulcans. It's nice to see this part explained, although you will end up wondering, so, it was only because of Picard and his crew that the Federation was born? If you start dealing with time travel, then one usually gets into the muddy parts, like how their part in the past had already happened and they were merely replaying history, so technically their winning was already decided all along.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of action, and was pretty well directed by Jonathan Frakes. I've seen some of his other movies, and he's a decent director, when he's given a good script and a fairly sizeable budget.<br /><br />The Data subplot is interesting too, since it really plays out the paragon between your deepest desires and whether one has the fortitude to reject them for the good of friends.<br /><br />Overall, a very good movie that deserves to be in your collection, especially if you are a TNG fan.</p></body></html>

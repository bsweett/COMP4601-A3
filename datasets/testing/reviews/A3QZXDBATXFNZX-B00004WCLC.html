Its so brillent in everyway its long but it holds you there just long enough intell you don't want to see anymore. The ending is one of the most unpredicable ending's in movie history. thats what movies are all about unpredicable,good acting,good story,good cinematography,and good direction and magnolia has it all.</p></body></html>

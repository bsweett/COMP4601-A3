<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Will Smith and Another Inspirational Real-Life Story Told Slightly Different Way"></head><body><p>"The Pursuit of Happyness" is a based-on-truth story about Chris Gardner, freelance salesman of portable bone density tracer. But carrying a heavy machine around in San Francisco is a hard work especially when he has to send his son to the daycare center, and not every doctor is interested in his `gismo.' Down on his luck, he accepts an unpaid job in the training program of a stockbroking house, but in spite of (or because of) his eagerness, his wife become more estranged, giving a cold shoulder to him.<br /><br />Will Smith is perfect as Chris Gardner, who eventually has to sleep in a public restroom in the subway with his son, making him believe that this is a `cave.' Because of the warmth and humor in Will Smith's performance and the visible rapport with his son (played by his real-life son Jaden), the film is not depressing as you might believe. Still some people (not me) might feel so looking at Chris doing jobs as unpaid intern, hit by a car in the street, and still going back to work even though he is uncertain of his future (only one applicant will pass the test).<br /><br />Italian-born director Gabriele Muccino avoids sugary sentiments in this Horatio Alger-like tale, and at times Chris' zealous attitudes look pathetic (don't miss one scene where Chris is seen dragging his son to catch a bus). It is clear that Muccino is trying to present his own version of American dream. The film gets really credible and its satire becomes biting when the company's bosses casually ask him to do things like lending five dollars. The bosses are not bad people (no `villains' appear), but they just don't see the vast gaps (financial and otherwise) between them and Chris even though they are both wearing suits.<br /><br />However, like many major studio films made by non-American directors brought in Hollywood, we can see director is trying to be different in contents, but we don't see in what way exactly. I read many reviews on this film, and though many used such words as inspirational and uplifting, some people said the film is depressing. The fact is `The Pursuit of Happyness' could be both, not content with being either of them. After all, what made Chris apply for the stockbroker's trainee course first? Was it a red Ferrari or his son's happiness?<br /><br />We are not sure of that. We are sure of Will Smith's heart-warming turn, however, and that is probably the greatest thing in `The Pursuit of Happyness' which is a feel-good movie, but there is somewhere in the film an untold part you can vaguely sense.</p></body></html>

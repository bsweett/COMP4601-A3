<meta name="summary" content="A Few Days In A Ghost World"></head><body><p>Being a fan of Hocus Pocus it was kind of hard getting use to Thora Birch go from that little girl with a big mouth to this teenager with a dirty mouth but hey everybody grows up. Ghost World is just that, you don't know too many people with a life as weird as Enid's or someone that is has a best friend that is the total opposite of everything they are. And you really don't see a lot of teens that fall in love with middle-aged men that have a life revolving around old vinyl records.<br /><br />You get a look in the life of a young girl with no life but at the same time she has a secret one that involves her dating a middle-aged loser. The loser also known as Seymour doesn't know that Enid and her friend Rebecca are playing with his head and they're only using him for comedy. Seymour is so weird and such a loser that Enid actually starts to like him for being different from the world like she is. And there's your Ghost film but somewhere it catches you and you can't stop watching it.<br /><br />To some people it may be boring and pointless but you have to know that HBO does play it at crazy hours in the morning and it does seem to be a better movie when your half dead. The acting is very good and I must admit that I didn't expect Thora Birch to outshine Scarlett Johansson but she played her odd character very well and that's what made the movie. The film turns into one of those stupid comedies with a dash of weird and you get a lot of laughs out of this one so it's definitely worth at least one view.</p></body></html>

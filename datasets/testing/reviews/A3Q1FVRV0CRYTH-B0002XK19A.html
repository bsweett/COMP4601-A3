<meta name="summary" content="A sequel that lives up to the original and paves the way for a brilliant trilogy!"></head><body><p>To quote the tagline from the first `Spider-Man' film, "With great power comes great responsibility", and in this case that is very true.  After the sheer brilliance that was `Spider-Man', Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had a great responsibility to make at least an equally impressive film.  Well, if you've been privileged to have seen `Spider-Man 2' (yes I did say `privileged') then you know that they succeeded in delivering a top-notch sequel!  Giving us sharper graphics, deeper story lines and excellent acting, `Spider-Man 2' is utterly fantastic.<br /><br />With the origin of Spider-Man out of the way, the second chapter has more time to explore how Peter Parker (Maguire) will deal with his new `responsibilities', including whether or not he should pursue a relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) or stay alone in order to protect the ones he loves.  His decision is almost solidified by the appearance of the evil Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina).  Once a great physicist, Otto Octavius was transformed into the monster known as Doctor Octopus after an experiment went haywire.<br /><br />Not only does Peter have this new atrocity to contend with, but his very best friend Harry (Franco) is bent on avenging his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man, and thus is determined to hunt him down and kill him.  When the very lives of his love ones are put in jepordy because of his newfound powers Peter is troubled with where to turn, and what to do.  Should he continue to fight the crime plaguing the streets or should he hang it up for good to protect those around him?<br /><br />`Spider-Man 2' serves as top-notch entertainment, ready and willing to please any who watch it.  I really don't see a down side, and with `Spider-Man 3' on the horizon there is sure to be plenty more to praise and look forward to as another chapter is unfolded.  Here's to hoping Sam and company can keep this up!</p></body></html>

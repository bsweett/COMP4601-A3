<meta name="summary" content="One of the best of 2005!"></head><body><p>Bill Murray gives another stunning performance in this film, as does the rest of the wonderful cast. Jim Jarmusch is such a talented director. His originality never ceases to amaze me, and this film is wonderful! Everything about it is great! It's the "Lost in Translation" of 2005, and you don't want to miss it! Some people may be put off by the ending. It's not a conventional ending. This film doesn't adhere to a typical Hollywood formula, so no, nothing is spoon-fed to the audience. We need more films like these!<br /><br />RENT IT. NOW!</p></body></html>

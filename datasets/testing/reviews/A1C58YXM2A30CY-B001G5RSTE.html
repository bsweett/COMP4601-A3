<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Family Film -- Gotta Move It, Move It!"></head><body><p>Caught Madagascar on TBS, sadly complete with commercials.  Great entertainment about city bred animals, and one particular zebra who wants to escape to the Wild, which might be just south of Connecticut!<br /><br />It's collision of friendship and predator instincts makes for an unusually gripping conflict.<br /><br />The most fun for me was the allusions to TV shows and old movies.  If you watched Twilight Zone and Planet of the Apes, even Chariots of Fire and Wild Kingdom, you'll know what I mean.  How many can you spot!<br /><br />It would be a fun Lunch game to see how many allusions you can spot.<br /><br />The story is  cute, kids will like it.  And adults will recognize a lot of music and movie allusions.  Great way to waste a couple of hours.  Can't wait for Madagascar 2.<br /><br />Also recommend:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCDFTW">Madagascar - Escape 2 Africa (Widescreen)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVKGQC">The Shrek Trilogy (Shrek / Shrek 2 / Shrek the Third) (Full Screen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

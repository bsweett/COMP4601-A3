Maybe I'm just soft on Jennifer Garner. She portrays her characters so well and with such a great heart, she elicits sympathy and support. You really, really want her to win every fight. And she does!<br /><br />In comparison with recent comic book films, Elektra is not quite as good as Spidey 2 but much better than Daredevil. I didn't miss Ben Affleck a bit. The film is on par with Xmen 2. In fact, the viewer will recognize very similar handling of both special effects and special "super" powers of the villains: Stone, Typhoid Mary, and Tattoo, courtesy, I suppose, of the same director for both films.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner is a heart-winner. She is beautiful, talented, and winsome. And so sweet. I must admit, playing a cold-blooded assasin like Elektra is a bit of a stretch for her- even her solid acting skills can't cover up that great heart and sweet spirit.</p></body></html>

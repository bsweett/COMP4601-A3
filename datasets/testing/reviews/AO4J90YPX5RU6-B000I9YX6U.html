<meta name="summary" content="Robin Williams is effective, in a creepy role."></head><body><p>An interesting story of obsession and being alone. Although oddly paced and somewhat dull at times, &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; keeps you watching till the shocking conclusion. Williams plays Sy &quot;the photo guy&quot; who becomes obsessed with a family who brings their film to the photo center he works at. He's so into them, because it's like the family he never had. Williams' character turns out to be quite the sick individual, due to a bad childhood that the screenplay briefly touches on. I didn't know what I was in for when I sat down and hit play on my DVD player. I'm sure this isn't what I expected though. I don't recommend this to those that can't step outside of the Robin William's comedy box. On the other hand it's a pretty good movie for most adults. And Williams is 100% watchable in an unlikely role for him.</p></body></html>

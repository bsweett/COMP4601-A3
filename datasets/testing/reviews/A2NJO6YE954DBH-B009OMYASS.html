<meta name="summary" content="Eli Roth ups the ante in the current wave of revulsion films"></head><body><p>In his treatise on horror, "Danse Macabre," Stephen King establishes the genre exists on three more or less separate levels with "terror on top, horror below it, and lowest of all, the gag relex of revulsion." In the wake of "Saw," and with "Wolf Creek" and now "Hostel," it seems clear to me that we are in the heyday of the low card in that particular set. The goal is to make the weak flee the room, before or after they throw up, and to make the strong put their hands over their eyes, but still sneak a peak through their fingers.<br /><br />"Hostel" is what writer-director Eli Roth did with the freedom Lion Gates Film gave him after his success with "Cabin Fever." As you probably know, hostels, usually called youth hostels, are what young people use when they are backpacking around Europe. As you can easily anticipate, "hostel" is real close to "hostile," so you can easily anticipate that this is going to be about one of those places where kids check in, but they do not check out. Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are backpacking across Europe, but have only made it as far as Amsterdam and are only having a good time and not a great time. Then they are told about a hostel near Bratislava in Slovakia where women will have sex with any guy with an American accent. Since Paxton and Josh are from the United States, they immediately head for Bratislava so they can have sex.<br /><br />Now, at this point the idea that the three are going to die horrible deaths sounds like a good thing, because we are talking two Ugly Americans and a freak from Iceland. These people are asking for it and the only fly in the ointment is that Roth delivers on the horrible deaths to the point that we are forced to admit that even these people do not deserve what happens to them. "Hostel" really has two distinct halves, with the European sex trip that opens the film giving way to the giant torture sequences. Roth even toys with his audience, relying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff. At this point no not feel terror, forget about feeling horror, and just go right for the revulsion.<br /><br />Even though it really takes too long to get to the blood and gore, and even though the film ends up taking its foot off the pedal at the end, I rounded up on "Hostel" for one reasons. That was because when I got to the point where both I as a viewer and the last character standing were wondering what the hell was going on, Roth came up with an answer that rather that surprised me ("Hostel" is actually inspired by soemthing that really happens, albeit in the Far East rather than Eastern Europe). I even felt more horror than revlusion as well.<br /><br />In terms of the current crop of revulsion films, there is s more blood and gore in "Hostel" than in either "Saw" or "Wolf Creek," but that is due in part to the fact the cast of this movie is several time larger. The other key distinction is that while "Hostel" obviously is set up for a sequel, which Roth is working on this year, it is really the only one of these films to offer any sort of catharsis in the end. That actually works against this type of film, and you might be surprised that "Hostel" is the most lighthearted of the three. So "Saw II" has the best squirming scene with the pit o' hypodermics, "Wolf Creek" will leave you the most empty, and "Hostel" will give you the most blood and laughs. Do not say you were not warned.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perfect Movie...Pristeen DVD"></head><body><p>CASABLANCA....The name alone conjurs up visions of World War II, Clandestine meetings, Romance and Exotic places.This film has all that and more. To  sum up this wonderful story(I'm so thrilled about the DVD I want to get to that too), it is the eve of WWII, the Nazi's are moving their way across Europe, forcing thousands to flee.  Many find their way to Casablanca, Morroco, which is under French rule and as of yet is unoccupied by the Nazi's. Most are looking for exit Visa's to get to America but it is easier said then done. Victor Laszlo(Paul Henreid)and his wife Ilsa(Ingrid Bergman)are among those people and it's harder for him then most. He is on the Nazi's most wanted list for leading the Czech Resistance. Rick Blaine(Humphrey Bogart)is his best hope.<br />  Rick, American ex-patriot,doesnt stick his neck out for anybody, until he sees Ilsa. His old flame, that mysteriously left him in Paris,("We'll always have Paris"). Rick still feels the sting of that day,but  as Ilsa's story unfolds he does stick his neck out for both Ilsa and Victor to help them get away, even though he loves her still.<br />This movie has some unforgetable music. including "As Time Goes By",("Play it Sam") and some unforgetable characters. Included in this marvelous cast are Claude Rains, ("Louie, I think this is the start of a beautiful freindship"), Peter Lorre,Conrad Veidt and Sydney Greenstreet. And don't forgot all the unforgetable lines, I've tried to mention a few here. It was directed by Michael Curtiz, and won the academy award for best picture of 1943.<br />  The DVD(Warner Bros) is a Pristeen transfer. The black and white cinematography with all it's shadows and lights that make film noir so dramatic is crisp and clear.I saw no signs of the age of this film.  Ingrid's eyes sparkle as much as her diamond earings.The sound is perfect. The disc includes a documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall with commentary by various people involved with the film. There are theatrical trailers for this and other film noirs and there are English and French subtitles for those in need of it.<br />"Here's looking at you kid"............Laurie<br /><br />also available in 3-pack of oscar greats:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EYC">Best Picture Collection - Epic Dramas (Casablanca/Gone With the Wind/Ben-Hur)</a></p></body></html>

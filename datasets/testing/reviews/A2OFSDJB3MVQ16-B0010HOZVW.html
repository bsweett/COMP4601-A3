<meta name="summary" content="Neil Jordan and Jodie Foster go down a dark alley"></head><body><p>Many people have compared this female vigilante film to earlier films like "Ms45" and "Death Wish" yet the fact that the sensitive Irish director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game, Interview with the Vampire) and Jodie Foster are involved plus the excellent Terrence Howard should make this a cut above those films. In many ways it is since instead of exploiting the violence that the main character creates--we get a sense that the closure will never come to that individual.  There is no catharisis, and Foster's character realizes what she is doing is wrong but she can't stop it? This element plus the superb interaction between Foster and Howard make this an above average action flick much much better than that terrible film which came out weeks before this one did ("Death Sentence" with Kevin Bacon).  What you make of the ending will depend on your perception of it but I believe it was disturbing and yet in a way, it was the best one available.  Recommended if you especially enjoy Ms Foster's work.  The HD DVD version which I bought for under  $6 is superb and a value at that!!</p></body></html>

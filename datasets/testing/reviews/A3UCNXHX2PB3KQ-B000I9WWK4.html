<meta name="summary" content="Utterly Terrifying"></head><body><p>This movie is successful in every sense of the world, full of scares and pulse pounding thrills, it never lets up and to this day is one of Carpenter's best. Its just a shame that the critics in 1982 didn't feel the same way.<br /><br /> In 1982, a group of American scientists are in Antartica, set for a long winter full of poker games. One afternoon, a Norwegian helicopter flies into the area. A gunman is chasing a seemingly cute and innocent huskie through the snow, but both men in the helicopter soon die. The dog wanders into the American base, and proceeds to morph into the Thing one night while in the dog kennel. Don't want to spoil the fun however.<br /><br /> This movie has some great effects for the early 80's, and never lets up or lets the viewer down. The gore is used in appropriate spots, but is stomach churning. This movie has its violence, but it doesn't need the violence to scare the viewer. This movie never get's overly predictable, is never boring, has a huanting score, and keeps you guessing to the identity of the lifesucking Thing for the entire film.</p></body></html>

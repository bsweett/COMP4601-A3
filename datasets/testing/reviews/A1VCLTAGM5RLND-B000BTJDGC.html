The courtroom scenes were interesting but ridiculous, mostly because the filmmakers try to convince us by any means that this possession really happened. The exorcism sequence is scary (sort of) and thrilling yet too long in my opinion. Jennifer Carpenter does an okay job screaming and making idot funny faces, while Laura Linney's talent is once again waste in a movie that doesn't do her justice.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A BRAINY ACTION-PACKED, SATIRICAL , CLASSIC"></head><body><p>Peter Weller is excellent as the nearly indestructible title character in Robocop, and the direction by Verhoeven in this sci-fi shoot-'em-up is equally effective, but it's the brilliantly twisted humor in the script by Edward Neumeier, and Michael Miner that make this film more than just another TERMINATOR clone movie, and even though the action is almost non-stop, the satirical asides ( such as the television ads for the 'family game' called NUKE 'EM, and the latest in car theft protection ) are deliciously warped. This is definitely a 'guy' pic, but what a great one it is!</p></body></html>

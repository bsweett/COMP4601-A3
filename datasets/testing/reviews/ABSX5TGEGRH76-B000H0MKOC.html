Tobacco companies, gun manufacturers, alcohol producers and distributors, fast food chains.  All of these businesses are enormous and often villified (often times for good reason).  The lobbyists' job is to spin the facts into positive arguments for their employers or to make the opposition look bad.  Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is one such lobbyist, and he sure is good at it.<br /><br />Thank You For Smoking is narrated by Naylor, who refers to himself as a coked-up version of "that guy who could pick up any girl at a party".  Talking is what he's good at, and it seems to be the greatest job imaginable.  He didn't need an advanced degree to get his job, and yet he makes a considerable amount of money defending Big Tobacco from health organizations and the US government.  Naylor's boss is known simply as B.R. (J.K. Simmons), a tough-as-nails Vietnam veteran who gets results from his constant insults to his employees.  Nick is divorced from his wife (Kim Dickens) who is sick and tired of him always sweet-talking her, and, in a bit of irony, is now seeing a doctor.  Nick's son Joey (Cameron Bright), an impressionable young boy, begins to take an interest in his father's work, and shows that he may have inhereted his father's flair for persuasion.  Every week, Nick meets up with his two friends who are also lobbyists.  Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) work for the alcohol and gun lobbies, respectively.  Their conversations tend to focus on whose product kills the most people and the best ways to get around negative press.  The thing about Nick is that he knows that he's BSing people, but he needs to pay the mortgage somehow.<br /><br />The great thing about this movie is its shameless satire.  No one is safe; yeah, the tobacco company has a lot of shots taken at it, but it also skewers the government, Hollywood, and reporters.  Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) is made a fool of numerous times, and Naylor's "cheese defense" is priceless.  What's even more amazing about the film is that, due to the way he spins things, many of Nick's arguments for cigarettes really work (the car/airplane one he uses right before the cheese one don't work in my opinion though, but most of the others actually do, which is pretty scary).<br /><br />It's a shame that this movie is only getting a fairly limited release, which means that not a lot of people will see it.  I think that this is a movie that everyone should see at least once.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't so that people can learn from it, because it definitely does not preach, but because it's such a great satire.</p></body></html>

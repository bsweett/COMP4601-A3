<meta name="summary" content="gripping story; slightly weak ending"></head><body><p>This film shows Robin Williams in a shocking and effective departure from his frequent comedic roles.  As Sy the Photo Guy, he obsesses unhealthily about one family whose photos he has developed for ten years, keeping a set of prints for himself and his collection every time.  He intrudes further into their lives, until things start to unravel as he discovers a secret about them and also loses his job.<br />In the last half hour, he tries to teach one of them a lesson, then ends up with a rather contrived scene which implies some shocking things about his own childhood and how he ended up so mentally unbalanced.<br />The photography and production design give a polished yet sterile feel to the environments in the film, showcasing Sy's lonely, pitiful existence.</p></body></html>

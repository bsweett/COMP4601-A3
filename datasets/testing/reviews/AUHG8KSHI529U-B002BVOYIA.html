<meta name="summary" content="How one man made a real difference in the Rwandan horror"></head><body><p>This is a powerful and moving film that tells the story of the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people through the attempts of one man to save a few from death by machete.  It is not an effort to tell the whole story of the Rwandan tragedy, nor is it an attempt to shove our faces into the horror of what happened in those months of 1994.  The protagonist is a simple hotel manager, a real person whose name is Paul Rusesabagina.  He is an intelligent and resourceful man working at a four star hotel in Kigali.  He knows how to use petty bribes to grease the wheels in order to get things done in this small and corrupt country.  He is a Hutu and a member of the majority, but his wife and therefore his children are Tutsis and are part of the resented minority.<br /><br />The movie doesn't spend much time explaining the dynamics of this situation except to point out that these distinctions are purely arbitrary and were created by the Belgians.  There are rumblings on the radio and in the streets that a slaughter of the Tutsis is going to happen, but Paul does not believe them.  The events erupt when the President of Rwanda dies in a plane crash and the agitators blame it on Tutsi rebels.<br /><br />Paul has no intention of saving anyone beyond his family when this all begins.  However, as it hits closer to home he makes noble choices and uses his skills in bluffing and bribery to keep his family and the ever growing band of refugees at the hotel alive.  It is poignant how these people are abandoned to the mobs by the West, but also significant how their private campaigns to their well connected friends in other countries buys them time.<br /><br />And the difficulty of working with those in the killing machine outside is not all there is, there are also those Hutus on staff that resent the Tutsis and buy into the lies urging them to exterminate the cockroaches.  It is an awfully precarious situation that Paul is trying to keep from tipping into extinction.<br /><br />The movie does show a few stark images without getting horribly graphic.  Don Cheadle gives a wonderful performance and deserves his Oscar? nomination and probably should have one the award for this performance.<br /><br />I think this is a movie that everyone should see and think about, especially with mature young people who need to know what happened not so long ago.  Then we need to think about what is going on right now in the Sudan and write our representatives about what we think should be done to help end that horror.  After all, that is really the point of this movie.  We can stay uninvolved because it happens so far away, but it sparks our conscience to ask us if we should.</p></body></html>

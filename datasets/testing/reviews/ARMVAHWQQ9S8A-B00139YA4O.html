<meta name="summary" content="Finally, a Popular Show That Deserves The High Ratings It Gets"></head><body><p>Lost is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545044251">Harry Potter</a> of television.  With its intricately planned plots, fully fleshed out characters with well-thought out back stories, and a wild premise that is brilliantly executed, this is a show with truly universal appeal.  It's enough to entertain the "we love action!" crowd, but there is also a deeper level to this show, which often works on metaphor as it connects the `main story' of Lost to the characters' histories, utilizing flashbacks in each episode.<br /><br />Unlike J. J. Abram's last series (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5V8DG">Alias</a>), you won't be checking the time while you're watching the first season of "Lost."  Every one of these twenty-two episodes is completely enthralling, focusing on the history and current situation of one character at a time.  Even the less interesting characters are easily able to hold up their own episodes.  There is always more to find out about each character as the seasonal arc builds, never giving the audience too little or too much.  Because that's what this show is really based on: mystery.  Be warned, Lost is not, I repeat, not for the impatient.  The arc of this series is based on the mystery of this island and the people who have landed on it, and every single time one of those nagging questions is answered, we are given a new question.  From the mystifying hatch, to the captivating character of John Locke, to the island itself, the sheer need to find out `what the heck is going on' will drive you through this season.<br /><br />Take all of that good stuff and add a cast of actors with rare talent and the most beautiful on-location scenes you'll find on network television, and you have the phenomenon that is the first season of "Lost."  Along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QDLSR0">Heroes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SULWJA">Veronica Mars</a>, this is one of the strongest television series we've seen in recent years.<br /><br />9/10</p></body></html>

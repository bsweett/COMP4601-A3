<meta name="summary" content="Technically interesting, but no heart"></head><body><p>Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Miller. The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity). As an experiment in aesthetics, it works - it's fun, it's technically interesting. As a film for an audience of more than two? Well, that's something else. The three narratives are insufficiently connected for this ever to gel as a single piece, and whatever chance you have of immersing yourself in the Sin City universe is constantly undermined by the insistent use of voiceover narration. You're never allowed to fall into the world, but are instead distracted by a never-ending string of "hard boiled" one-liners that describe precisely what you're seeing on screen or could reasonably deduce from the performances if the camera were ever allowed truly to capture them. These could be interesting stories about complex, damaged people, but Rodriguez fails to get the most out of the material because he doesn't seem to trust it - nor himself. In his obsession to replicate the precise look of what's on the page, he fails to use more of the power of the screen - strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual style. It leaves me wondering why he bothered. If you're not going to use the power of the other register, why bother with a transposition? The result is a film that's technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core.  And violent. Violence is justifiable in the context of a story, but this whole piece seems overly cruel as a way of masking its lack of character, humanity and meaning.  And rather than growing out of the long noir tradition, it feels like a postmodern hijacking of it.  Worse, it isn't even hijacked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it, nor refresh it by flipping it into an unexpected context (as Rian Johnson did so effectively with "Brick".).  Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love.  But in a town this self-indulgently violent and artfully superficial, it's hard to take that claim seriously.</p></body></html>

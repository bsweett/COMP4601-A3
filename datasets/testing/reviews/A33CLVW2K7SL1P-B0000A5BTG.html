<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected, but disappointing in some areas"></head><body><p>There's no question that the science behind The Core is unconvincing and absurd. Of course, the outer core *could* conceivably stop spinning because of a device invented by a madly genius  and egotistical geophysicist, and this *could* cause a disruption in the electromagnetic field that protects us from the sun, but the manner in which it happened in the film is bizarre and unlikely. Also, the likelihood that the "savior" who built the machine and developed the hull of the ship that protected it under the tremendous and heat as they bored through the earth is, well, silly.<br /><br />However, the science behind Star Wars is similarly unbelievable. Why is Star Wars exciting then? (And I'm not referring to the first two films, which aren't terribly good - the word is still out on Revenge of the Sith.) Because it presents a scenario that is exciting and edgy, replete with suspense.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, I believe that The Core has received undue negativity because of the improbability of the science behind it. However, it's not the science that is the driving force of the film. As viewers, we need to do the same thing we did with films like Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: we need to suspend disbelief with regard to this quixotic undertaking . Once we successfully do that, we have a taut, engaging film with good performances, even if some of the dialogue is trite, and the interpersonal relationships rife with clich&eacute;s, as well as the actual characters themselves. What causes the film to rise above the scientific anomalies, the dialogue, and the relationships is the solid acting and the exciting race to the center of the earth.<br /><br />Hilary Swank was criticized as being miscast for her role in this film, and upon watching it, I was puzzled as to why. Certainly, choosing her character to be second in command was perplexing, even if she did manage a seemingly unnavigable landing in the beginning of the film. Nevertheless, her acting was solid. She has been miscast in other roles, but not here. Her humane resiliency seemed ideal for her character.<br /><br />One thing that I particularly enjoyed about The Core was that nobody was safe. At any given moment, anyone could die. This is a risky undertaking. Too many films have all of their heroes happy and fine at the end, but here there were no guarantees. High props for that.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from the film, and was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed it. While I am writing what certainly comes off as a highly favorable review, I can't ignore the problems I mentioned above when coming up with a final rating. The overabundance of unimaginative characterizations brings this from a potential four-star film to a three star film.</p></body></html>

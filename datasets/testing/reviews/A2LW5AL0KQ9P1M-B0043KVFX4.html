<meta name="summary" content=""It Really is the End of the World ...""></head><body><p>This is a SERIOUS niche film: the third installment of a zombie film based on Capcom's "Resident Evil" games. Talk about a narrow audience! And, even as a member of this small group, I entered the film with low-expectations (it is always difficult to please this type of viewer). Sure, I was thrilled to see the addition of Ali Larter (Final Destination, Final Destination 2 and "Heroes"), but I refused to allowed myself hope.<br /><br />Maybe this is why I found the film a pleasant surprise (yes, it had its rough areas ... I'll address that in a second). The premise is relevant (the world has been completely ravaged by the T-virus, the entire planet is an acrid wasteland of undead). The writing is clever (plenty of unpredictabilities ... even down to a guy who can predict the contents of label-less canned-goods ... odd talent). The acting is convincing (some reviewers here found Jovovich's acting "wooden" ... I feel like they may have forgotten that the storyline dictates she is no longer entirely human). The setting is fantastic (so perfectly desolate). The cinematography is impressive (gorgeous color! very saturated!). For me, there is very little TECHNICALLY about which to complain. In fact, I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish. For me, it was gratifyingly tense (especially the scenes in Las Vegas)!!<br /><br />Rough areas. Okay, let's delve into some of the deeper issues. I was a little perturbed that the heroes of the film were all women ... especially when these women are desperate to transport a group of children to an uninfected area. It is, perhaps, a little too obvious. Yes, Oded Fehr reprises his role as Carlos, but it is pretty clear that Claire (Larter) and Alice (Jovovich) are the leaders (I mean, Claire's team is NAMED after her AND she is their tactician). Likewise, that all members of the Umbrella Corporation council are male is equally as frustrating. I would have liked to have seen a little balance here. Similarly, the treatment of the sole black male lead (L. J. played by Mike Epps) was disconcerting. Rather than provide huge spoilers, I will only note one small aspect of his character that may prove disappointing: his "smoking" habit. At first blush, this seems amusing, but ultimately it can be viewed as little other than stereotypical (still, Epps does wonderfully in his role ... I do not want there to be any confusion about that!) But, these troublesome areas were not glaring enough to pull me out the film. These were thoughts for the ride home.<br /><br />All of this aside, maybe I'm not the best person to persuade you one way or the other. I've been a gamer since I was five, I've been a zombie (zombi) enthusiast since I was eight, and I've always loved Capcom's "Resident Evil" series. So, I guess I'm not particularly unbiased. What you need to do to enjoy this film: you should have seen Resident Evil and Resident Evil - Apocalypse (for your sake and those around you), you should love zombie films (hey, who doesn't?!), and should dig gaming (so that you can look at your friend and say "BOSS FIGHT!"). If you fail to meet this criteria you may still enjoy the work, but I have a feeling you will only be frustrated.</p></body></html>

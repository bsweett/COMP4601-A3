Never mind that "Dreams" sounds a lot like "Supremes." Forget that the name "Deena" sounds terribly close to "Diana" or that Beyonce Knowles has an uncanny resemblance to Miss Ross and sounds like her. And the last song the women sing as a group has the same sentiment as "Some Day We'll Be Together."<br /><br />The story line is a little thin; the film gets off to a slow start but gathers a lot of momentum as it progresses. By the time Jennifer Hudson sings her incomparable rendition of "I Am Not Going," the most skeptical viewer is hooked. Besides Ms. Hudson's knockout performance, the other surprise for me was Eddie Murphy who in this film is not to be believed. He plays the character James Earley (a James Brown reflection?) with grit and passion and dominates the screen when he is on-- and he isn't a bad singer either.<br /><br />In the end it's all about the music. The production numbers are quite wonderful. It's worth whatever you paid to see this film to see and hear Jennifer Hudson. Finally the dedication to the late Michael Bennett, involved in the stage version, was touching.<br /><br />A film not to be missed.</p></body></html>

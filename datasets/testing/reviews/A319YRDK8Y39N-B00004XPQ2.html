<meta name="summary" content="Only some minor flaws mar this otherwise splendid film."></head><body><p>The Bridge on the River Kwai is a fantastic film account of one man's misguided but honorable attempt to rally his men together in the midst of troubling circumstances.<p>When British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and his men willfully surrender to the Japanese army, they are sent to a prison camp where they must work on an enemy railroad bridge. But Nicholson won't stand for it, eventually having his men do it on his terms. Soon he's virtually running the prison camp, but his misplaced duty has him doing his best work for the enemy.<p>Though at many times it seems ludicrous that a British Colonel would really be so out there that he'd think he was doing a good thing helping the enemy, stranger things have happened. Once you let yourself believe it's possible, the film becomes extremely engrossing, entertaining and splendidly produced. Though it doesn't come close to the masterpiece that director David Lean later created in Lawrence of Arabia, this is still a great film. Guinness as always is wonderful, standing out from the cast as a gifted actor.<p>However, I can't dismiss certain flaws I felt the film had. The sub plot of an American escapee (William Holden) doesn't begin to mesh well with the colonel's story until the second half when he's sent back in with a team on orders to destroy the bridge. Also, the use of Asian women on that team is almost laughable. In the midst of the hot, humid jungle, they're always smiling at the men while serving them. When one was placing mortar shells into a weapon while smiling during combat at the end, she reminded me of the Price is Right girls showing off a prize. Though this depiction of women was standard in film for the time period it was made, it only comes off as silly now.<p>But by and large, this is a wonderful film that easily allows you to overlook these flaws. And worth multiple viewings just for Guinness excellent performance</p></body></html>

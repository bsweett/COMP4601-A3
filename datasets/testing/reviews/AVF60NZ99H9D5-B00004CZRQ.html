<meta name="summary" content="the Devil made me see it again--thirty-some years later"></head><body><p>Friedkin's scare flick still has legs--thirty-plus years later. Get it. The making-of doc is interesting.<br /><br />I thought some of the dialogue Detective Kinderman had to say (liking to go to movies and discus same) just didn't sit right. Also, the idea that Regan's mom was an actress (in a movie) didn't fly with me...but other than that, the film works--all the way. Cobb, Burstyn, Jason Miller, Linda Blair...et al...make for a solid cast.<br /><br />I think William Friedkin is one of the finest directors around, if not the best, when it comes to creating atmosphere and using extras.<br /><br />Lastly, if you're the religious type and believe in demons...you just may want to stay clear of this fright classic.</p></body></html>

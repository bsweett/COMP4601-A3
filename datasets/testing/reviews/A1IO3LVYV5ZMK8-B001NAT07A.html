<meta name="summary" content="Bad script entertains"></head><body><p>Catwoman isn't a movie but more of a flashy music video that features raw special effects and is littered with cheesy dialogues with a lack of emotional core. Clearly this movie has deviated from the portrayal of the dark feline heroine to a lame exercise in waxing empowerment in women. Halle Berry is the lone bright spot in the movie, playing Catwoman with a sensual grace and giving us a convincing transformation from the silenced mousy designer Patience Philips to the heroine who battles an over-the-hill cosmetics mogul (Sharon Stone) out to destroy beauty. Seeing her prancing around in her tights and wielding the whip should be worth the ticket price for some. Catwoman clearly aspires to be a C-grade popcorn movie with high camp value. In this aspect, it succeeds - the bad script and exaggerated cat-fights really left me unexpectedly hysterical and even embarrassingly at times purring in delight.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HINTS OF --- "DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER""></head><body><p>IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />The first two films of the Austin Powers series were filled with fresh ideas and silly lampoons of James Bond, Flint, Matt Helm and others. The results were very giggly, silly, vulgar, and irreverant, but mostly sappy humor all in good fun that most viewers enjoyed. Goldmember is different in that it is not as universally enjoyable.<br /><br />WHY GOLDMEMBER IS NOT AS UNIVERSALLY ENJOYABLE - HINTS OF "DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER":<br /><br />"Goldmember" can be seen in the same light as "Diamonds Are Forever", resorting to overused and recycled ideas which yielded flat performances, obvious cliches, and limited enthusiasm from the movie-going public. Like the Austin Powers franchise, the James Bond franchise was incredibly popular and it appeared impossible to go wrong with the same ideas, plots, and, of course, Sean Connery as Bond.<br /><br />WHAT ONCE APPEARED FUNNY NOW SEEMS VULGAR AND AT TIMES PAINFUL TO WATCH:<br /><br />I recall, in 1971, feeling very restless and uncomfortable watching many of the scenes in "Diamonds Are Forever". Jill St. John just did not fit and I wondered why she was so scantily clad throughout the film. Certainly we had seen that before in 007 films! Then, we had those two ridiculous "hit men", "Wint" and "Mr. Kidd". Were they any more ridiculous than "Odd-Job" or "Random Task" or "Fat B******"? Probably not. The dialogue in both films were pretty much standard and the plots had the usual evil, crazy, eccentric-villian-extorts-the-world scenarios.<br /><br />SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF -- WHERE DID IT GO?<br /><br />In both earlier Austin Powers features, as in Connery's earlier 007 flicks, we had very far-fetched plots, gadgets, superhuman abilities, time for female companionship even as the world is about to be destroyed, but most of all the "suspension of our disbelief" was achieved --- SOMEHOW!<br /><br />We bought the idea of a repellent [Miss Kensington's word] Austin Powers sweeping a gaga Vanessa off her feet in the end, bad teeth, nerdy retro-caveman behavior, and goofy clothes notwithstanding. But in "Goldmember" this type of leap of faith just didn't happen on the part of many in the audience.<br /><br />LACKING THE LEAP OF FAITH - GOLDMEMBER SEEMS IN BAD TASTE<br /><br />I found scenes like Goldmember and his skin to be truly disgusting, and had to fight the urge to just turn the movie off. The same thing happened to me while I was watching "Diamonds Are Forever". So, if you were among those who were able to make it over the hurdles and achieve that leap of faith that allows one to believe in the film, then "Goldmember" was a worthy addition to the Austin Power's franchise. If you were like me, and couldn't, then you may find yourself happily viewing the first two Austin Powers' offerings while ignoring "Goldmember". Let's just hope that if they make another, they infuse some fresh ideas into it as was the case for the 007 franchise after "Diamonds Are Forever".</p></body></html>

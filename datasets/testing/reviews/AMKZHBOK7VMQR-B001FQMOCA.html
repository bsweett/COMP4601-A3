<meta name="summary" content="Very Entertaining Biopic with Great performances from both actors."></head><body><p>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both wonderful in the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter. This is basically a film about their relatonship viewed through the lense of Cash's career and struggles with family and drug abuse. The film is extraordinarily entertaining from beginning to end and the musical sequences are very well done. Both actors deserve a lot of credit for doing the singing and making the performance sequences realistic. No doubt Witherspoon deserved her Oscar and Phoenix was equally deserving in a tough field.<br /><br />Having seen Capote and this I think it would be a close call but I'd have given the award to Phoenix.<br /><br />Overall this is an uplifting story about a love between two people who were obvious soulmates and survived in an environment that makes long term marriages a challenge at best. Very enjoyable film.</p></body></html>

As much as you want to declare that these people just have problems and move on there is more than a healthy dose of reality.  For me Clive Owens and Natalie Portman stole the show and truely earned their Oscar nominations.  I expected more out of Roberts and pretty much felt Law was the same character we met in I heart Hucklebees and that Captain Tomorrow thingy.  The script was disturbingly brilliant and even manages to pull off a final surprise at the end.  Recommended but not to the faint at heart.</p></body></html>

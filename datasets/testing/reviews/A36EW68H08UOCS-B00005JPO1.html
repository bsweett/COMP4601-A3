<meta name="summary" content="Count me a disappointed Indy fan"></head><body><p>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull might have been a favorite of mine if I had watched it a quarter of a century ago - before seeing the first Indiana Jones films and much of the rest of the Spielberg canon.<br /><br />Unfortunately for my enjoyment of THIS movie, I couldn't help but compare it to what came before.<br /><br />Without spoiling it for those of you who want to see the film, how can I convey to you, gentle reader, my disappointment?<br /><br />I see many "spoiler" reviews posted here, and I don't want this one to join the ranks.<br /><br />There is much to like about the film.  There is perhaps no living actor who so embodies the fictional character they portray as Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.  Indy is twenty years older, but undeniably Indy.  Seeing him gives you the same comfortable feeling as putting on a favorite pair of jeans or pouring a glass of your favorite beverage.<br /><br />But part of the appeal of the Indy of the previous films was his apparent real human fragility in the context of near super-heroics.  Near the end of "Raiders", after Indy has been beaten, dragged, shot and near exhaustion (in the time frame of the movie he's been awake for three days at least), he finally gets to lie down.  Karen Allen's Marion tries to jump his bones, but he is too tired and hurts too much to respond.  We similarly see Dr. Jones recoil realistically from beatings, draggings, etc administered in "Temple of Doom" and "Last Crusade". This AARP candidate no longer seems vulnerable to trauma because "Indy, Revision Four" takes several hits that would kill a strong person and barely flinches.  The "human" Indy is interesting - the "indestructable senior citizen" Indy is a cartoon character.<br /><br />The early plot is interesting in a movie serial kind of way - updating the convenient screen villains of circa 1940, the Nazis, with convenient screen villains circa 1957, the commie Russians.  Along the way we get to see Jim Broadbent as a surrogate for the late Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody and Shia LaBeouf in a Brando "Wild One" homage.<br /><br />The last part of the plot is a mess, and though I'd like to say more about WHY, let's just say it felt like a blatant ripoff of at least two OTHER Spielberg movies from a five year period straddling 1980.  If you see "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List" you have a certain expectation.  If you see an Indiana Jones movie you have a certain expectation, and the final part of the plot simply does not belong.  I felt disappointed in a "what a rip-off!" kind of way.<br /><br />Excellent stuntwork fills the frame in one thrilling set-piece after another.  If not for the "you've got to be kidding" ending and the newly indestructable nature of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., I would have rated this movie MUCH higher.  As it is I can only recommend it for people who can't imagine missing an Indiana Jones movie - and you've probably already seen it.</p></body></html>

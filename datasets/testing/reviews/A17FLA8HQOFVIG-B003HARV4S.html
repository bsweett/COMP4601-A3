But then again, I should have known that any film with Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti would be something special.  I've been following the careers of both of these actors, and they have always chosen excellent roles.  I had never seen Jessica Biel before, but she also showed up as an imposing film presence.<br /><br />The film is set in Vienna around the turn of the 20th century.  There's a dreamy quality about it, and the gaslight and candlelight feels absolutely authentic.  Edward Norton and Jessica Biel are childhood sweethearts.  But, alas, she is royalty and he is the son of a carpenter.  They are forced to separate and he travels the world for 15 years.  When he comes back to Vienna, he is "The Illusionist" and we meet him onstage as he impresses his audience.  His fame grows.  And soon the crown prince wants to see his show.  Jessica Biel is now the crown prince's fianc&eacute;.  But as soon as she participates in a trick with the illusionist, she recognizes him from her childhood.  The scene is now set for romance and intrigue.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is cast as a police inspector.  He is the glue that holds the story together as we view the action through his eyes.  He is perfectly cast in the role.  He too, is lowly born, but the wicked crown prince, who is likely to fly into a rage when challenged, holds the key to elevating him to a much high position in court.  But first, the police inspector must prove his worth.<br /><br />A murder investigation is central to the plot.  And we all know that The Illusionist knows more than he is letting on.  When we look into Edward Norton's eyes, we know he is hiding something.  But we can't tell what it is.  He is the master of every scene.  I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Many of his scenes are onstage.  And we know they are illusions.  But how does he do it?<br /><br />Wisely, the filmmakers kept away from computer graphics.  All the illusions seem real.  And we, the film audience, experience them the same way an audience in 1900 would have.  I was absolutely caught up in the plot and the mystery.  I knew there was a secret and my mind was constantly trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />And then, in the very last minute of the film, it all becomes clear.  Fascinating.  Well done.  And thrilling.<br /><br />I loved this film.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

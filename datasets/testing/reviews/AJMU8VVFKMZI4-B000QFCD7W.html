I don't think too many people would have thought about this combination of actors and surprisingly they all work well together.  Lawrence was somewhat tamer than normal and believe me that is a good thing.  Travolta gets caught over acting quite a bit, and Macy and Allen were spot on.  Together though these four actors find their mojo and create one fun movie.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

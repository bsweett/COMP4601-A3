<meta name="summary" content="A Good Movie Made Better With Great DVD!"></head><body><p>. I really enjoyed it!  It has a very creative story that rolls out very well-done, with plot twists here and there. The ending is very thought-provoking; it's what you'd call a "thinking man's sci-fi".<p> Now, it is definitely true that the movie overemphasizes on special effects.  This is VERY evident in three main scenes:<br />a) The scene in which Mr. Scott flies Captain Kirk all around the Enterprise is soooooooooooooooooooooooo long! The only thing that saves it is the beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith, but I still have to fast forward.<br />b) When the Enterprise sloooooooooooowwly floats out of dock, once again takes forever. There's a beautiful shot of the Enterprise flying towards the camera, and slowly revealing the sun, but nothing more.<br />c) The scene where the Enterprise is flying through V'Ger, though showing off some very impressive and creative backgrounds, is absolutely endless, and I REALLY have to fast forward.<p> But aside from that, the only thing I can think of that I don't like is the uniforms: everyone looks like they're at a PJ slumberparty! (Paramount wisely threw them out and replaced them with the really cool uniforms used throughout the rest of the original movieseries.)<p> The new "Director's Edition" DVD is an absolute must-buy for any Trek fan!  The best things are the all-new special effects and sound mix.  You get to see a more clear view of the inside of V'Ger, as well as a full view of the outside of the huge V'Ger ship (which looks really cool)!  The new sound truly expresses the magnificence of Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score!  The special features are passable, but not great (mainly consisting of three documentaries).  The real gem of the two-disc set is the restored film itself...</p></body></html>

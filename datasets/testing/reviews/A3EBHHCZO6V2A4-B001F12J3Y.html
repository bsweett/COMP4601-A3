<meta name="summary" content="Bipolar Express"></head><body><p>Chris Van Allsburg's "The Polar Express" is a beautiful little book about the magic of Christmas and faith. When it got to the big screen,much was lost in translation. Instead,it's a triumphalistic ode to commercialism,and is depressing at several points. Despite its amazing animation,it's a soulless Christmas film.<br /><br />In the beginning,the Hero gets welcomed onto the magical train. Later on,the Lonely Boy from the poor side of town comes onto the train-but he gets shoved into the back&is ignored by everyone except by the Hero Girl,who's really the heart of the story. There's a pointless musical number about hot chocolate. The Hero questions his belief in Santa Claus,and a spectral hobo tries to "help" him. After some exciting scenes with the train running over ice and dodging elk herds,the children arrive in the gloomy North Pole,where scratchy records play classic Christmas songs in empty factories. The North Pole scenes are incredibly eerie,evoking the Twilight Zone's famous "Where is everyone?" episode. In the end,there is the Triumph of the Santa rally,complete with entertainment from an ugly Steve Tyler lookalike elf. Aerosmith is for the Armageddon movie,NOT a Christmas movie.Ugh. Josh Groban has a beautiful song called "Believe";quite a contrast to the movie. The Hero gets his present,while the Hero Girl,who has shown courage and compassion,is treated dismissively by Santa himself. No good deed goes unpunished.<br /><br />"Polar Express" ends up being a creepy Tom Hanks vanity project. If you want to be in the Christmas spirit,skip this movie. Avoid it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The VIKING movie of the year!"></head><body><p>... there lived a boy who couldn't quite live up to the bar his father set for him in his life. Despite his efforts, he usually failed to the chagrin of the town and the man (his father) who was its leader. Hiccup (a quite apt and funny name for this lad) one night decides to prove himself by launching a trap for the nefarious "Night Fury" dragon, and surprise, he snags one. Finding it wounded in the forest, the boy learns not only how to care for and train his dragon, but also, how to find his own unique footing in his life. Such is the tale of the heart warming and wonderfully vivid family family, "How to Train Your Dragon."<br /><br />Created by Dreamworks, which always seems to be in the shadows of the superstar Pixar, has finally come into its own with this cinematic experience. One of the first things you might notice is the spectacular flying sequences between Hiccup and Toothless. The magic of the animation is spotless, and what even makes it more breathtaking is the fact that there is little to no dialogue in these scenes. That adds to the splendor of seeing Hiccup fly, both literally and symbolically, over his village and life.<br /><br />Dreamworks concentrated on the usual Pixar strengths, of story, of character, of heart. This movie has all three, and all three in spades. The ending of the movie, which shant be revealed here, is one worthy of a few Kleenex. I, a somewhat cynical and hardened viewer to sentimental scenes, was totally taken off kilter by the enchanting surprise of emotion embedded in the context of the film. Dreamworks nailed it.<br /><br />Parents, be wary of very young kids seeing this film. I would have no problems having my second grader on up seeing this film, but anyone younger may have trouble with some scary dragon scenes, especially towards the end, warranting the PG rating.<br /><br />However, what lingers with me after seeing this movie is the strong relationship threaded throughout, esepcially between our hapless hero Hiccup and his man-killing dragon Toothless. For "How to Train Your Dragon" is in itself a wonderful metaphor, for never judging people too harshly before one gets to know them a little bit, and the benefits reaped when one does. A bit adventure, a bit fun, a bit emotional, all makes for a wonderful time at the movies.</p></body></html>

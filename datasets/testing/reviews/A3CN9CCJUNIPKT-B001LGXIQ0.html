<meta name="summary" content="A successful modern spoof"></head><body><p>This modern-day update of TV's classic "Get Smart" spy spoof is an entirely successful comedy film, and definitely better than I would have thought. Steve Carell's Maxwell Smart isn't as nebbishy as one might expect, based on either the original role, or on Carell's other roles -- indeed, this Maxwell Smart is much more capable than the earlier incarnation, where he usually won over the forces of evil by sheer dumb luck. This film is a savvy spy parody with a light, sure touch -- it drags a little in the end (the inevitable chase scene) but overall, it's quite intelligent and genuinely funny. Worth checking out!

Ok, then you'll be in your glory.  Bruce takes this film to all new levels of, well, who knows what.  Campbell is still fun to watch, and his rendition of The King is flawless.  If it wasn't for his performance, this film would rate only one star.  Campbell saves it...and it achieves a solid two star review.  Horrible in every sense of the word, but, yeah baby, you still wanna watch don't you?  Well, thank you, thank you very much.</p></body></html>

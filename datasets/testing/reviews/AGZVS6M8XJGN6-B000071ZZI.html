He's instructed to go and kill somebody... In the movie, he is given the diagnosis of selective dissociative amnesia...What they did is, they had him forget who he was but they allowed him to continue to remember all the training and the things that he learned over time...<br /><br />Damon's character, Jason, has been trained in self-defense, weapons handling, high-speed driving, disguise, and secret writing communications... He knows that he's very attentive, and very observant...I really enjoyed the scene in the diner when Jason is telling Marie he doesn't know who he is but he knows that he can name the license plates of all six cars outside, and the clothing that people were wearing...<br /><br />Marie's character is very helpful to Bourne's character... Based on his unconscious clash of feelings and what he was doing, and being a killer he would've made strenuous efforts to create a new identity if he didn't have a penchant for love...And it was his development and his journey into finding the power to feel that was a big part of this movie...<br /><br />Jason and Marie's love is a not a classic love...It's definitely a relation of two people who walk next to each other, interact and cross only several times but not all the time...Jason is definitely taken by her, by her forcefulness and her vigor as she's very much alive where he isn't, where he feels lacking any strong emotion... At that point he was still struggling to try to get his memory back...<br /><br />When you see the sequel or the two parts together, it makes sense because evidently Jason is still haunted... He still has nightmares from things he'd endured... While on the contrary, Marie probably is more the active force trying to set up a home for them...He's definitely the one who still feels on the run because he still is under constant restraint...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yep, missed it by that much..."></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of the original series. It had it all: comedy, romance, political satire, physical comedy and action. The humor was both broad and subtle. The movie captured the broad strokes, but missed the subtle humor. Carrel made the role his own and was very good. Hathaway as 99 worked pretty well. Arkin's role as the chief was good. The physical comedy was good. The romance worked. The relationship between Max and the chief worked. The cone of silence and the other gadgets were excellent. Some of the scenes fell flat. The homage to the car and the shoe phone of the original show was good.<br /><br />In summary, the movie was good. It missed some of the political satire and subtle humor of the original show, but for a movie made from a TV series it was very good. My wife and I laughed a lot, which is the major test of a movie like this.</p></body></html>

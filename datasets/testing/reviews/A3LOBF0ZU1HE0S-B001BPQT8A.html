<meta name="summary" content="The best pyschotic thriller since Kalifornia"></head><body><p>A serial killer (Spacey) is on a mission to kill seven people that commit the seven deadly sins, gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and  lust. Brilliant acting from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freedman, Kevin Spacey's  performance as the serial killer is absolutely suberb, and fantastic  directing from David Fincher. A definate must see for any serious horror or  thriller fans. Not for those who are easily grossed out.</p></body></html>

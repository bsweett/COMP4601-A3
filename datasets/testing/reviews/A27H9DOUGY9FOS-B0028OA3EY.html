<meta name="summary" content="A Welcome Return--A Savvy and Emotional Superman Holds Strong"></head><body><p>I came into "Superman Returns" with moderate expectations.  I'm not one of those people who have been yearning for the revitalization of the franchise.  The original "Superman" with Christopher Reeves was a good movie all but destroyed by one of the biggest "cheat" endings in film history.  I hated it when I was a kid, and I still hate that ending--heck, if you can turn back time, it really negates all drama.  "Superman 2," however, was more to my liking--good villains and a nice mix of romance and comedy.  And the less said about the other films in the series, the better.<br /><br />So, "Superman Returns" was a very pleasant surprise.  While still retaining the innocence and cheesiness of tone, the tale has been updated with modern day sensibilities.  Starting five years after "Superman 2"--everyone has moved on in Superman's absence.  Most notably, Lois has a new man and a child.  But not to dwell on the plot, let's just say that it's brisk and amusing.  There are some nice action set pieces--the most memorable being Superman saving a doomed airliner.  I saw this film on the IMAX screen and this was most definitely a highlight in 3D.  And I really enjoyed the way elements of the original film (Brando, anyone?) are incorporated into the film's framework.<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a fine job filling the shoes of steel.  Kate Bosworth is surprisingly effective--oh, but why does she have to be so neglectful of Clark?  James Marsden actually has a much better role here than in the final "X-Men"--what a disappointing send off he got there.  As Lois's other man, he is a credible alternative to Superman as a romantic lead.  One of the pleasures of the film is that he's a fully fleshed out and worthy rival--not a boob or a villain!  And Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey have a grand time overplaying the villains--it's especially good to see Posey in a major film.<br /><br />The success of "Superman Returns" is that it honestly develops the relationships--there is a real emotional resonance, real longing, real passion.  It's a smart script that doesn't betray the characters, but richens them--it really adds to the Superman lore.  "Superman Returns" is a sophisticated and solid entry--it's always a great surprise when you don't have to be ashamed of liking a big summer blockbuster.  KGHarris, 11/06.</p></body></html>

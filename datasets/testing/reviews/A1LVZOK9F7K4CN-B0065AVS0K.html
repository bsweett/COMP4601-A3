Most of the audience that I saw it with loved it, but my friend thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen.  Of course, he's not into comic books.  The real significance of this film is that (with the possible exception of the Hulk) this is the movie that most captures the feel of a comic book.  Not only does it feel like "a comic book" - it feels like THE comic book, Sin City.<br /><br />Sin City is a series of black and white graphic novels in the "noir" style by Frank Miller.  Miller shares directing credit on this film, along with Roberto Rodriguez.  Not only was Miller on set every day but the film IS ALMOST A SHOT-FOR-SHOT TRANSLATION OF THE GRAPHIC NOVELS.  I've only read the first in the series, but I don't really feel the need to read the other two that this film is based on because I believe they will be exactly the same.  Rodriguez has used the panels from the comics as storyboards and re-created them as faithfully as possible.<br /><br />The film of Sin City is also the first film to capture the modern conception of comic book violence.  Remember the good old days when the term "comic book violence" referred to superheroes like Captain America duking it out and never suffering greater injury than a black eye?  Not any more.  In the adult, gritty comics, the emphasis is on pain, torture, sadism, and especially dismemberment - I lost track of how many characters get dismembered.  This is possibly the most violent and goriest movie I have ever seen.  Because it is mostly in black and white, blood shows up white.  Characters take and dish out more punishment than could ever be possible in real life.<br /><br />Possibly, the people who do not like this film are put off by its gruesomeness.  I don't know if the audience is meant to take pleasure in the torturing of the bad guys simply because they are villains.  Certainly, there are no "good guys" in this movie - just anti-heroes (with the possible exception of the Bruce Willis character).<br /><br />Also, people who are not into comic books may have a hard time with the film.  Most of talking in the movie comes from voice-over narration because 1) it is a nod to film noir and 2) it is an almost direct transcription of the comic book.  However, I've never seen voice-over used this extensively, and - as the movie Adaptation tells us - voice-over is a cinematic no-no.  Some people may be put off by it.<br /><br />Regardless, I've never seen a movie ANYTHING like this before.  If you're into graphic novels, film noir, or over-the-top comic-book violence - or just movies with an original voice - check it out.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE: This is NOT a movie for little kids and I was horrified to see parents taking their toddlers into the theater.</p></body></html>

This Indy movie takes place in the 1950's and Dr. Jones(Harrison Ford) must stop Soviet Russians from getting their hands on a powerful Crystal Skull. This is the first Indy movie to be packed with CGI! The scene where Indy survives a nuclear explosion was laughed off the screen and it coined the phrase, "Nuke the Fridge". Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen) from Raiders is back, thank goodness. The subplot with Indy's backstabbing friend is just plain confusing. John Williams' music score is decent and he writes a good music cue for Mutt Williams(Shia LaBeouf).<br /> Crystal Skull got some bad reviews, but it still made money at the box office. Teenage kids in a muscle car listen to Elvis Presley's 'Hound Dog'. This could be an homage to George Lucas' American Graffiti(1973). The scene where Indy escapes from the warehouse is the best action scene in the film. One of the fun moments is where a statue of Marcus Brody flies through the windshield of a car! There's a picture of Dr. Henry Jones Sr. on Indy's desk. Indy tells Mutt that Pancho Villa took him hostage in 1916. This happened in the pilot to The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles(1992). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has many flaws, but it's still worth watching with a bucket of popcorn and some soft drinks.</p></body></html>

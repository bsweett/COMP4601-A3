<meta name="summary" content="Mixed emotions from Greece"></head><body><p>Troy is a very good movie that brings to life the director's version of how he would have liked Homer's story of the Trojan War to have been.  The movie does not faithfully follow the original, rather it is INSPIRED by Homer's Iliad, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the original story. One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied the Iliad, you know the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...  From this very long list the most important alteration of course was when Achilles enters the city of Troy, which he never actually did.  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is the Iliad in question and not some modern twentieth century novel.  Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read the Iliad) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually did occur according to Homer.  Consequently, due to the distortion of Homer's work, the movie poses a very serious danger of producing armies of misinformed people who think they know Homer when they really do not.  Not good!<br />Lastly, special emphasis must be made on the point that the Trojans are Greeks too, with the same language, the same gods, the same names etc, which is another thing that the movie does not stress enough, leaving relations between the combatants vague/open to any theory.<br />On the positive side, the movie is action packed, the special effects are great, the acting is very good and the cast are wonderful.  Peter O'Toole, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, and the rest of the actors have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.  Hopefully, more movies will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.<br />In short, it is my belief that the movie deserves 4 stars for the top quality and entertainment it provides, but falls short of 5 stars for deviating so much from the original and creating a sense of confusion among viewers.</p></body></html>

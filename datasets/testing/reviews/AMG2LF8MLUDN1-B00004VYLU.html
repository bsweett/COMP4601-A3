<meta name="summary" content="Maybe the best gangster film of all time"></head><body><p>There are many gangster films that rank high ratings but this one may just top them all.  We all love to see films about the bad guys and even root for them at times (what's up with that anyway?).  Martin Scorsese gives us an insider's peek at the way gangster life is.  It's full of realisms that you may not find in other crime dramas.  While this film is full of violence, it does not glorify violence but shows you what happens to those who lilve that life.  Live by the sword, die by the sword.<br /><br />Goodfellas could have been named The Rise and Fall of Henry Hill.  This film is based on his recollections of his former life.  You actually get to see Hill and hear him speak of those days in the special feature section of this dvd.  He does not look at all the gangster we see portrayed but looks are deceiving are they not?<br /><br />Paul Sorvino is positivley deadly in his role here even though you never see him lift a finger to anyone.  He states that he wasn't comfortable with the role because he wasn't sure how to portray a killer the way he needed to portray him for this film.  The outward appearance was easy but the inside of the man was more difficult.  After having dinner one night he got up to check his face in the mirror and saw a look on his face that literally made him jump back from the mirror.  It was then that he found the look of a killer he was seeking.<br /><br />Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci are, as usual, brilliant.  Pesci's character is especially disturbing because he is violent and 100% grade A nuts!  His best seen is probably the one in the bar when he, Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) and others are laughing and telling stories and then suddenly the mood changes on a dime just because Hill tells him that he is funny.  "What's so funny about me?  What the @#@#@# is so funny?  Do I amuse you?  Everyone is frozen with fear because they don't know what to expect from this lunatic.  It's a very intense, powerful scene.  Finally, Hill laughs because he realizes that it's a put on and then everyone laughs.  In the special feature section it is revealed that this very same incident really happened to Pesci and Scorsese added it to the film.<br /><br />Goodfellas contains first rate performances from the whole cast.<br /><br />It's a must see for those who love the genre.<br /><br />Parents please be advised that this is not a movie for children.  There is a lot of violence and foul language.  I advise a viewing age of at least 18.</p></body></html>

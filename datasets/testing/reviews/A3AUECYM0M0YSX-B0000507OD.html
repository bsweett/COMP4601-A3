<meta name="summary" content="Stunning transfer--maybe best yet any B&amp;W film has received"></head><body><p>Even if you have this already, even if you've seen it a million times and feel the film holds no surprises, you should still get this DVD.  There's never been this much grayscale in a print of Kane.  The restoration team actually went to the best sources for each reel (the original negatives do not survive) and then digitally-removed each and every scratch from the final composite print (except in the newsreel sequence, where some of the footage is supposed to look scratched).  The sound is rich and full but has no phony exaggerated hi-fi characteristics.  Chapters are easy to access.  Packaging is first rate.  In short, there isn't anything to gripe about.<p>The first disc also has the original theatrical trailer (as original in its own way as the film itself, and a hoot), production stills, bios, newsreel footage of the 1941 premiere--in short all the stuff you'd expect.  Then it has a couple of terrific bonuses in the form of running commentary from Peter Bogdonovich, who knew Welles and wrote a bio on him, and everyone's favorite sweatered film critic, Roger Ebert.  You might think a total of four hours' of lecturing on Kane while the film plays would be tedious in the extreme, but you'd be wrong.  The second disc is a real treat: an Oscar-nominated American Masters documentary from 1995 entitled The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which parallels the life stories of Hearst and Welles as they rose to prominence and fell from influence.  I had taped this show off TV when PBS aired it, but I was thrilled to get this bonus disc of the same documentary here, razor sharp and in superb sound.  Younger folks who don't know much about Citizen Kane beyond the fact that it's considered a &quot;great film,&quot; or who don't know about Welles' many other accomplishments, or about the life of Hearst and the evolution of muckraking journalism, can watch this 2-hour documentary and then have a deeper appreciation of the movie.  The documentary makes a great companion disc and was a wise choice.<p>At the price this is a steal (essentially the second disc is free), the transfer superb, and of course Kane is great, still stunning after all these years.  (A lot of the camera tricks would be hard to pull off even today, in this age of advanced optics and computers.)  There are some really thrilling sequences, snappy dialogue (&quot;I lost a million dollars running the paper this year.  I lost a millon dollars running the paper last year.  I expect to lose a million dollars running the paper next year.  You know, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in sixty years.&quot;)  and terrific performances from everyone save Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, who in my view wasn't quite up to the complex role.  (On the other hand George Coulouris as Mr. Thatcher and Ray Collins as &quot;Boss&quot; Jim W. Gettys are terrific even though they occupy relatively short screen time.)  The cinematography and editing were literally 20 years ahead of their time.  Whether or not Kane is &quot;the greatest film of all time,&quot; it is certainly one of the most influential, and interesting in that it ultimately ended up being more about Welles than about Hearst.  (Which one of them wound up dying alone and lonely and embittered like the character of the film?)  This was the first DVD I bought and a cornerstone of any movie collection.</p></body></html>

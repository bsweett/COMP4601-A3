<meta name="summary" content="A Good, Not Classic, Sports Movie"></head><body><p>Based on the book of the same name, Friday Night Lights is an honorable addition to sports movies.  To say that the fans of Permian high school in Odessa, in west Texas, live for their team could be the understatement of the year.  It makes for a ton of pressure on 17 year old boys, but then, none of these "boys" look anywhere near 17, a standard Hollywood problem with teenage character movies.<br /><br />The movie runs around two hours; you don't notice the time, a very good indicator.  It has excellent cinematography, including some superb setting shots that wonderfully capture the vast emptiness of West Texas.  Billy Bob Thornton as the coach is as good as I've seen him and singer Tim McGraw as the bullying father of one player launches a second career.  The football action, particularly the close-up tackling, approaches NFL highlights for realism.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are problems besides the overaged "boys."  Some of the story lines get pretty short shrift.  For example, I never did figure out just exactly what the weirdness was with the quarterback's mother, failing health? kind of wacko?, who knows? And Permian's opponents in the state championship are painted in such ridiculous villain colors that it virtually invites the audience to hiss.<br /><br />While not nearly as good as its thematic cousins Hoosiers and Remember the Titans, Friday Night Lights is still definitely worth one of your own Friday nights.</p></body></html>

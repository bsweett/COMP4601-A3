<meta name="summary" content="Better Than The Original"></head><body><p>Hostel II continues the story of the underground torture ring where rich businesspeople pay large sums of money in order to kill someone.<br /><br />The film starts out with Paxton (Jay Hernandez) recovering from his wounds inflicted in the first movie.  He is also suffering terrible flashbacks.  Soon, his girlfriend kicks him out of their house.<br /><br />In this installment, three young girls; Beth (Lauren German), Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), and Whitney (Bijou Phillips) decide to take a break from their studies in Italy and go to Slovakia for a vacation.  While on their way, they meet another girl, Axelle (Vera Jordanova).  Axelle convinces the others to change their plans and instead go to a relaxing outdoor spa.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two American businessmen; Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart) have heard about the Elite Hunting Club.  Todd has "bought" his friend Stuart a girl to kill.  Soon, the two guys are flying to the torture chamber.<br /><br />Unknown to the girls, Axelle is working for the Elite Hunting Club, and soon, Beth, Lorna, and Whitney are captured and placed in the chamber.  However, Stuart is having second thoughts about his involvement with Todd.  Will anyone survive this time around?<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie more than the first one.  There is less sex in this one.  Instead, director Eli Roth has focused more on the blood and terror, which he accomplishes perfectly.  There are some truly memorable scenes, such as the scene where Lorna is suspended, nude, above another woman, who systematically cuts and slices her, while bathing in Lorna's blood. But, the ending is the best, and male viewers will most definitely want to cross their legs.<br /><br />I recommend this scary and terror-filled film.  If you liked part one, then you'll enjoy part II much more.</p></body></html>

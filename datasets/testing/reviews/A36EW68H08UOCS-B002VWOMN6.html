<meta name="summary" content="Lush and Magical Mozart - Best Picture of 1984"></head><body><p>I see many reviews comparing the various formats, but I wanted to write about this movie, a thrashing good one.  Amadeus tells us the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from the perspective of contemporary Salieri, and the device makes for a richer viewing experience because the Mozart depicted in the movie is a divine musical genius, but an immature, prideful man-child in his life.  The film makes the point that he died in poverty, unthinkable today for an artist of his stature.<br /><br />Tom Hulce was nominated for Best Actor as Mozart, not only a musical genius but taking a joyful pride in his music.  This Mozart is presented as an 18th century rock-star, chasing skirts and drinking wine the moment the music stops, in addition to having a certain disrespect for all who are musically beneath him - in other words, pretty much everyone.<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham won the Academy Award as Salieri, who is vastly less talented, but at least understands and appreciates Mozart's music.  Salieri's music is a calling, and we're shown early in the film that Salieri has become a kind of musical priest - asking God for enough ability to rise out of his working class background to be able to hobknob with royalty.  He lives an otherwise monk-like life, and when he sees the irreverent Mozart showing scarcely a care for anything, yet apparently touched with an ability that could only come from Heaven, something in Salieri snaps - he vows to crush God's favored musical son. (The film is based on the 1979 play by Peter Shaffer.  The thought to depict the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri is based on one of Mozart's letters in which he wrote that he thought Salieri was so jealous he might poison him, but there appears to be no evidence that Salieri was involved in any way with the early demise of Mozart.)<br /><br />Prodigiously prolific, Mozart composed 41 symphonies (to 9 by Beethoven) and 23 Operas (to 1 by Beethoven), along with a horde of genius concertos, chamber pieces, piano works and sacred music.  Genius musicians cannot comprehend the creative gift that would allow Mozart to do all this before dying at age thirty-five.<br /><br />There are a few framing devices in the film - we first see an elderly Salieri many years after Mozart's death, consumed with guilt that he killed Mozart.  Most of the story is told in flashbacks with old Salieri confessing to a Priest.<br /><br />We see the boy genius Mozart, playing piano and violin for royalty as a toddler.  We see the first meeting between Mozart and Salieri - Mozart has been invited to Vienna to perform for the Austrian Emperor Joseph.  Mozart works for his patron, the Bishop of Salzberg, but Mozart is irreverent and disrespectful.  Emperor Joseph (played in a comic turn by Jeffrey Jones) sees an opportunity to woo the promising Mozart to stay in Vienna and commissions an opera - The Marriage of Figaro.  This causes some consternation among the royal house since the opera is based on a play that has been banned in Vienna (due to its satirical view of aristocracy just prior to the French Revolution). Many of Mozart's other unconventional methods are scrutinized and criticized.  After the eventual premiere of Figaro the Emperor comes back stage with his entourage and offers lukewarm encouragement.  When the Emperor can't think of a musical term to characterize his lack of enthusiasm he turns to his Kapelmeister who admonishes Mozart that there are "too many notes".  Mozart asks "which would you like me to remove?"<br /><br />Milos Forman won the Oscar for direction, one of eight academy awards for the film.  I saw attempts to recapture the epic proportions of Amadeus later in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008RV1S">The Red Violin</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TN">Immortal Beloved</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MV8AE0">Copying Beethoven</a>, but Amadeus still stands atop the heap of artistic film interpretations of musical greatness.  Amadeus is immense in scale and ambition, but also intimate in moments, serious and light.  Forman's balancing act may take historical licenses, but it engages our attention, our sympathy, and our enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

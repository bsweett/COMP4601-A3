He has no memory of who he is or anything about him.  He ends up being in some very tight spots and demonstrates that he has a wide variety of impressive fighting skills.<br /><br />In his quest to figure out who he is, he connects with a young German woman, Marie (Franka Potente) who assists him throughout much of the show.  As it goes along, he (Matt Damon) discovers that his name, or one of them, is Jason Bourne.  It turns out that he is a CIA assassin.  While he has amnesia, his employers think that he has gone rogue and are attempting to kill him.<br /><br />All of this makes for a story with lots of action.  The events take place all across Europe.  It is really a very entertaining film that is a good one for any fan of action flicks.</p></body></html>

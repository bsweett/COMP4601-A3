Reviewers and critics made it seem as though this movie had the plaque. I must admit Oliver Stone did not sugar-coat the story or makes Alexander too heroic. Believe me; you may never see a major motion picture that tells the story like it is like this again. Oliver Stone took a different approach with this historic figure and he really didn't capture the real spirit of Alexander the Great the way it was written in history books.<br /><br /> Anthony Hopkin's as Ptolemy is one of his weakest and least interesting roles he's ever played and would have been better left out of the movie. I think the film would have been better had Stone told Alexander's life straight out, ditching the narrator and focusing on the life of an amazing warrior. Stone leads the viewer to believe that Alexander, though married three times, also enjoyed the (sexual) company of men----Hephaestion, his long time best friend (played by Jared Leto) and Bagoas, a Persian eunuch. The scenes are vague and leave a great deal to the viewer's imagination. If he was going to include this point of view about Alexander's life, he should have not been afraid to explore these relationships. The sexual tension between Alexander and Hephaestion was much more interesting than the relationship between Alexander and his first wife, Roxane (played by Rosario Dawson). Their violent first night of love making was unbelievable and completely void of any chemistry. As for Colin Farrell I thought he did fairly well with the poorly directed role he was given. By far, the most interesting was Angelina Jolie's (minus the accent) scheming Olympias, a woman determined to see her son become king, at any cost.<br /><br />It's obvious much of the film's budget went into the sets, costumes, and their authenticity which was great. I wouldn't mind viewing the uncut version to this. My theory is that people should not be reprimanded for telling a true story in its raw form. Oliver Stone and Mel Gibson are among those people. I don't recommend it to everyone, but if what I've written above strikes a chord with you, or you truly love history and would like see what the world circa 326 BC might have looked like don't pass on Alexander. It might not be `Alexander the Great,' but it truly is Alexander the Colossus.  One should just approach it for what it is and not what one would expect a historical epic to be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as it could've been 6/10"></head><body><p>This was probably the weakest of all the X Men movies. I do not hate this movie like say Spider Man 3 but still it's not good. Directed by Gavin Hood stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth, Danny Huston as Colonel William Stryker, Taylor Kitsch as Gambit & Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox. I 'm going to be honest this movie has a lot of problems. Like Wolverine & Sabertooth are brothers. Basically they join Team X & later due to questionable actions & disregard for human life Wolverine leaves moves to Canada goes under the name Logan he's lived there for 6 years with his girlfriend Kayla. Colonel Stryker tells him that people are killing members of Team X ok this could be like a Commando version of X Men. Kayla is murdered by Sabertooth Wolverine gets pwnd by Sabertooth & he's offered a way to beat him to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium. Logan overhears Stryker say erase his memory. Wolverine fights his way out & hides at a farm. Stryker has his men track him down they kill the owners of the farm. Then were introduced to Remy LeBeau or Gambit he mangles to convalesce him to take him to Stryker's main headquarters at 3 Mile Island. There Wolverine finds out Kayla wasn't killed she's been working with Stryker all along so he will release his sister. It has too many problems the stuff with Wolverine & Sabertooth being brothers wasn't needed cause all we need to know is they have this history they hate each other. Wolverine's woman working with Stryker it was 1 of those left feild things but it just didn't work for a movie. The PG 13 rating didn't help cause in Wolverine's past it's dark & violent it should've been rated R. The CGI for the claws look so fake. CGI or pactical effects when the claws came out in the other 3 movies it looked good. Wolverine losing his memory by an adamantium bullet is lazy script writing. Deadpool looks like Baraka from the MK games. I liked some of the action it has some ok fights. Gavin Hood wasn't the best choice for this movie maybe Bryan Synger could've done a better I don't know but Hood isn't capeable. Hugh Jackman was good. Danny Huston was a bad choice I'd rather had Brian Cox come back. Liev Schtaiber I didn't care for. Lynn Collins was ok. Taylor Kitsch was ok as Gambit but they should've done a better job I mean 4 movies & this was it. There going to do a 2nd Wolverine movie I hope 20th Century Fux are far away from it & it's R rated. I'm not looking forward to The 1st Class mostly cause I'm not a fan of prequels. I'd say rent it to see if you like it.</p></body></html>

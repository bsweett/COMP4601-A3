I especially liked the actress that played Toula's mother, and her saying of how the man is the head, but the woman is the neck and the head cannot turn without the neck is classic and a refreshing attitude to hear from a woman. There's lots of funny situations as Toula's fiance has to contend with her (huge) family. It is more of a 'chick flick' for people who like sports movies or movies with lots of guns and explosions, but it truly is a memorable and fantastic film that never gets old.</p></body></html>

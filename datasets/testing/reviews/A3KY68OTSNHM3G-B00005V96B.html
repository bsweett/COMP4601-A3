The two work for Monsters, Inc, a company that produces power by scaring children in their rooms and capturing their screams.  However, children are extremely dangerous to the monsters.  One touch from a child can kill a monster.  Boo, a little girl, manages to sneak through her closet door and into Monsters, Inc unnoticed.  She is soon discovered by Mike and Sully, who must find a way to get her back safely in her room while keeping her out of sight of the other monsters, especially Randall (Steve Buscemi), who is Sully's biggest rival.  What follows is numerous laughs and close calls as Mike, Sully, and Boo try to outsmart the others.  <p>This is a fun movie for adults as well as children.  Boo is your typical toddler; curious, funny, and always trying to get into trouble while Mike and Sully take on the role of surrogate parents as they try to keep Boo from the others. The outtakes at the end of the movie are funny as well.  Overall, this is a very funny and touching film.  The animation and acting are excellent, and the story line will definitely keep both children and adults laughing all the way through.</p></body></html>

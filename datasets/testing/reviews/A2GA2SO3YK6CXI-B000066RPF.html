<meta name="summary" content="AAAArrrrgggghhhh!!! Talk about silly... but funny..."></head><body><p>This movie starts with some clips that make you feel you are lost, or took the wrong DVD to watch... soon enough you realize that even the opening lines, and the credits have been written to keep you laughing... not sure if at the plot... or at the fact that you are watching one of the silliest films ever made.<br /><br />But... we watch from beginning to end... The movie starts with King Arthur of the Britons searching throughout the land for brave men to join him to form Camelot... the Knights of the Round Table.<br /><br />He finds the pure Sir Galahad... the daring and brave Sir Lancelot...  As the movie opens, you hear the distant clapping of horses hooves, only to realize that what you are indeed hearing is only  a servant, banging coconuts together to pretend... and you know you are in for an ever ending sequence of rather funny and definitely silly recreations of history... where famous characters spend their days and nights overcoming obstacles in search of the Holy Grail.<br /><br />King Arthur is played by Graham Chapman, while John Cleese is seen as the Second Swallow-Savvy Guard, The Black Knight, Peasant #3, Sir Lancelot, the Brave, the French Guard who taunts King Arthur's group, and finally as Tim, the Enchanter.<br /><br />In the end... King Arthur finds the Castle of Arrrghhh... where the Holy Grail actually is... and we had no choice but to say to ourselves.... Arrrghhh!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="violence and fairy tales......."></head><body><p>As you probably know, this movie is like 2 movie, a kinda dark fairy tale, and<br /><br />a very dark war story, with its dark characters..  The darkness and violence<br /><br />from one destroys the other.  i viewed this movie, i admired the very nice<br /><br />photography and effects of the fairy tale portion, which was slowly destroyed<br /><br />by the other story.  Even if everyone loves this movie, i shall never view it<br /><br />again,and shall not buy it....why...the world is dark enough, and i dont feel<br /><br />i have to be reminded with dark war characters, the world has enough of them.</p></body></html>

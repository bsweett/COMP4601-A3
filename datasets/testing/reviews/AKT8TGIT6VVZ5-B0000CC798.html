<meta name="summary" content="X2 Definitely Better Than The First"></head><body><p>Without question, &quot;X2&quot; offers more exciting, action-packed sequences than the first &quot;X-Men&quot; film. It's one of the best films I've seen based on comics superheros. Bryan Singer deserves ample praise for his crisp direction. To his credit Singer does an admirable job delving into intolerance with the X-Men mutants providing a fantastic allegory with racial and religious intolerance. And of course Patrick Stewart is brilliant once more as Professor Xavier, with his old friend and nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen), assuming a more important role in this installment, and McKellen's portrayal nearly as riveting as his Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. However, Alan Cummings almost steals every scene he's in as Nightcrawler. And I agree with a previous reviewer that it is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, which provides the emotional heart of this film. I was never a fan of the X-Men comics, so I am surprised that I found this film quite engrossing and memorable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Twice the budget.. half the movie of the first"></head><body><p>With twice the budget, this movie is only half as good as the original Resident Evil.<br /><br />The problem ?<br /><br />Resident Evil like most "Zombie"-related films get their appeal from the feeling of dread derived by being pursued relentlessly by massive hordes of living dead.<br /><br />In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we get about 8 minutes of zombies at the beginning and 2 minutes at the end.<br /><br />The rest of the movie revolves around our band of heroes fighting the Umbrella Corp. Security Team.<br /><br />Call it "Matrix Meets Resident Evil".<br /><br />Not as entertaining as the first by any means.</p></body></html>

With Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) frog father on his deathbed, Shrek has had to serve as king of Far Far Away in the interim.  And uneasy lies the crown.  We have some knee-slapping good times watching Shrek to his level-best to be the king to the people, but even an ogre with a good heart just isn't cut out to be the king.  He messes up nearly everything he dies, and he stinks at being the king.  Shrek is the first to admit this.<br /><br />Thankfully, Eddie Murphy is back as Donkey and Antonio Banderas returns as Puss In Boots. The movie just wouldn't have been the same without them. Their constant bickering and commentary helped move that plot and the characters along quickly. Plus they got some of the funniest lines in the movie.<br /><br />Prince Charming returns as the villain in this one. The opener showing him working dinner theater in a low level pub is just hilarious. The effort so fits the character, and so does all the grief he takes at the hands of the audience. Of course, he's trying to exorcize his demons by starring in a play where he triumphs over Shrek, which is what he thinks he should have done in the first place.<br /><br />Then, and I'm going to use a line here that was painfully obvious in the movie that was never used, Fiona's father croaks (he's a frog, remember?). But before he does, actually after several false alarms, he tells Shrek that there is one other heir to the kingdom of Far Far Away: a young boy named Arthur.<br /><br />Shrek resolves to go find Arthur and crown the boy king. All Shrek wants to do, all Shrek ever wants to do, is get back to his beloved swamp and get on with sharing his life with Fiona. But when he boards the ship to begin his voyage, Fiona tells him she is pregnant. It's all too much for Shrek. The nightmare he has about having ogre children is absolutely side-splitting. Not only that, but the movie double dips on the whole nightmare premise and caught me flat-footed on one of the quick twists.<br /><br />In the meantime, back in the heart of villainy, Prince Charming retreats to a pub where all the evil characters in the fairy tales hang out and begrudge their existence. The scene where Charming rallies the troops really works. I was ready to vote for him myself.<br /><br />After that, we're treated to a series of eye-popping adventures as Shrek goes back to high school to get Artie, which is how Arthur is known among his peers. Shrek also discovers that Arthur is the much-maligned prey of the school bullies and butt of all practical jokes. No one likes him.<br /><br />With nothing there to stay for, Arthur decides to join Shrek and go back to be the king. Along the way Shrek ends up playing the father role to Arthur, which could have been predicted but still played well.<br /><br />With the end of the movie in sight, everything is up for grabs. The visual comedy in the combat scenes is amazing. The twists and turns the plot makes as it follows a much-trod path are brilliant. It's the little things in the Shrek films that add up to big laughs.  Like the pay-for-play window Pinocchio dances in while Shrek is trying to get information about the location of Fiona. Like Arthur throwing himself on the ground and crying his eyes out to get Merlin to help them get home. Like Donkey, while possessed by Puss In Boots, when he tries to make all his fur stand on end like a cat. Like Donkey's kids when they spelled out the smoke message that tells him they love him.<br /><br />One of the best things to come out of left field, and there were several, was Fiona's speech to the princesses of Far Far Away to rally them into a combat force. Sleeping Beauty's attack on the tree guards at the gate to the city is simply amazing, and I found myself lifting my jaw off the floor and laughing out loud. Music is so much a part of the Shrek movies, and there's plenty of it on the soundtrack.<br /><br />I always go see the Shrek movies on the big screen, and I have a hard time waiting for the DVD release so I can watch them again. Despite my attention to the screen, there's always something I miss. Plus so many of the laughs can be enjoyed over and over. Like the Gingerbread Man's Six Million Dollar Man run through the fields. I can't wait for the DVD, and I can't wait to see if there will be - hopefully - a SHREK 4.</p></body></html>

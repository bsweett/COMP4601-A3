<meta name="summary" content="Elizabeth I, The Virgin Queen"></head><body><p>Our fascination with British history continues as we watched the gorgeous sequel to Elizabeth I, "The Golden Years." Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called "The Virgin Queen" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.<br /><br />Elizabeth I, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, is more moderate than her father. The movie continues to create great suspense as we learn more about the latter years of her reign. Her loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, continues to help the monarch to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and Elizabeth is able to check mate all attempts against her.<br /><br />The extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur added amazing detail to provide authenticity as to the battle between England and Spain, and they build a ship that is half Armada, half British, then PC replicated, providing awesome battle scenes. The architecture and decorations of the time are exquisite, filming where construction is actually taking place, and dressing in period clothing all construction workers, so the reality is magnificent.<br /><br />In this film we see a monarch that is now experienced but confronting great challenges because her Catholic cousin, Mary Stuart is after her throne and upon her death, Spain sees the opportunity to attack England under the disguise that she has executed an anointed queen. We see the relationship the queen has with Sir Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen, who brings unique gifts from the new discovered lands of Virginia, named in honor of the Queen. His masterful knowledge of the seas provides great insight to Elizabeth during the defeat of the Spanish Armada.<br /><br />One of the most spectacular scenes is where the Queen is on her horse, encouraging the people of England to fight to death if necessary to keep England free from foreign domination.  As with the first installment, Elizabeth is simply superb, don't miss seeing this movie!</p></body></html>

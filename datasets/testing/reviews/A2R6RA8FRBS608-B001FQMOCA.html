<meta name="summary" content="great acting with energy--a fine biopic"></head><body><p>Walk The Line is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. We get outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Look also for a strong showing by Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian. Waylon Payne also acts well as Jerry Lee Lewis. The plot moves along nicely even though there is little time spent on Johnny's childhood and his stint in the military; and the cinematography is well done.<br /><br />When the film begins, we get a brief glimpse into the main themes that ran through Johnny's life when he was a very young boy growing up in the South. His father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was rather cold toward him and became even colder still when Johnny's younger brother Jack (Lucas Till) died after an accident with a chainsaw. After what seems to have been a brief period of time in the military, Johnny marries his sweetheart Vivian and tries to make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. However, Johnny's efforts in sales just didn't work out--but when he and a couple of his buddies get a chance to record a record for Sun Records things finally begin to look bright for Johnny and his young family.<br /><br />Of course, complications ensue. Johnny spends time on the road--in fact, he spends a lot of time on the road and after he meets June Carter on the road his marriage to Vivian slowly but surely begins to crumble. Vivian tries hard to get Johnny to stay at home more and focus on his children; but Johnny never seems quite able to do that and after quite a few years they divorce.<br /><br />Johnny pursues June Carter even though she marries another man; and he never quite gets over his poor relationship with his father. After time, Johnny's addiction to amphetamines also takes a toll on his career.<br /><br />Will Johnny be able to finally convince June Carter to marry him? How does his relationship with Columbia Records go while he has all his personal problems? Just in case you're not familiar with the story of Johnny Cash, I'll leave these questions and more for you to find out as you watch this excellent flick.<br /><br />I certainly think the storyline should have continued after 1968; Johnny lived and did much more with his life and career between the years 1968 and 2003 when he passed away. However, the story is quite strong and the ending titles do give you a pretty good idea of what happened to Johnny and June Carter in general.<br /><br />The DVD comes with quite a few deleted scenes and there is an optional running commentary with co-writer and director James Mangold. Great!<br /><br />Johnny Cash fans will love this biopic which is rather good despite a minor flaw here and there. I was very impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon performed all of their songs without any dubbing! Johnny Cash was a good human being and an exceptionally talented man who deserves to have his life portrayed in a biopic. People who like biopics will also enjoy this film. It's a keeper!</p></body></html>

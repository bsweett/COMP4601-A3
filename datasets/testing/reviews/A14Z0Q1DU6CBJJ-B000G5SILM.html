<meta name="summary" content="Nothing that one episode of 24 won't show you"></head><body><p>THE SENTINEL was, all in all, pretty run of the mill, unchallenging, forgettable and offered nothing more that what you could find in one single episode of the show 24.<br /><br />The SENTINEL explores the life of a Presidential Secret Service Agent. When an off duty Secret Service Agent is gunned down outside his home, talk begins to circle about a plot to kill the President and a potential MOLE among the Secret Service. So, when SSA Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) fails a polygraph, the heat is not far behind.<br /><br />All sounds very intriguing, and it is, but the problem is with the delivery. Watching the film, it seemed like an entire season of 24 crammed into a 2 hour movie. There was SO MUCH going on. Bad guys. Possible bad guys. Moles. Possible moles. Affairs. Suspected Mole on the lamb. Informants. Assassins. A shoot out in a public place. Murders. Secrets. It all seemed too choppy.<br /><br />The movie sort of has an empty feeling. People do heroic things, but they didn't grab my gut. Shocking things happen, but the movie is so hyperactive that you never truly get the desired feeling from it. Characters are established, but not really fleshed out... like Jill Marin (Eva Longoria). We meet her. We see how swift she is and why she has gotten this new job, but by the end of the film, we realize that she wasn't all that necessary cause she didn't do much.<br /><br />But the main gripe I have is the lack of exploration and explantion given to the BRAINS behind the assassination plot. You never truly feel the danger from them because you don't know them. Why are they dangerous? Why are they doing what they're doing? There personalities are only highlighted but not given enough attention.<br /><br />Finally, there are a couple of VERY questionable incidents involving the bad guys. Why would the assassin open fire in a crowded mall where everyone can see him? Not only that, but why would he instigate it? They didn't know who he was. What's he shopping for anyway? The second incident would give away too much of the ending, but the brains behind the operation seemed to leave his brain in the trunk when he got there.<br /><br />Then of course, there was the cheesy 80s music ending. I was completely expecting Michael Douglas, as he walked away from the capital, to jump into the air, kick his heels together with glee which would be captured in freeze frame glory.<br /><br />The SENTINEL could have been a good film. Kiefer Sutherland is his solid self, playing David Breckinridge, a variation of Jack Bauer from 24. Michael Douglas is real, sympathetic and solid. Yet, the rest of the characters are one dimensional, not unlike the story and the execution.<br /><br />It's not a horrible way to spend a couple of hours, but had I spent money to see this at the movie theatre, I would have REALLY been disappointed. I expected more than what we got with the talent that was involved.</p></body></html>

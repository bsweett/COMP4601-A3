<meta name="summary" content="Clasic film, great animation"></head><body><p>The CGI animation in this film has been beautifully rendered, especially with the action and kung fu scenes. The story itself is also great, with some truly funny dialogue and memorable lines. Even though one shouldn't judge a movie solely on its visuals, it's hard to ignore them in this film since they were so beautifully rendered, especially with the motions of the characters since they move so naturally. Overall it truly is a memorable film, and stands out as a classic storyline and animation-wise.</p></body></html>

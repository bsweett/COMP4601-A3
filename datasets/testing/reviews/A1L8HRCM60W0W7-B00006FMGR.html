<meta name="summary" content="Inspiring, even interesting at times, but.."></head><body><p>8 mile's a flick bout shae ... in da hood,<br />Rapping to be cool, fairly understood,<br />Pseudo-rhymes, music crimes,<br />Lotsa rapping lotsa times<br />Man in da house, expect nuttin great,<br />A story of grit in da face o' cruel fate<p>Sorry about that, but it'll prepare you for this flick. People who are about to see it are most likely carrying a heavy baggage of expectations. And to such folk, here is a spoiler: 8 Mile is an absorbing movie if you like hood flicks, even an insiring tale at times, but I wonder if it commanded the supposed accolades that critics squandered upon it. Indeed it may be the 'Purple Rain' of our decade and is similar on several levels to the famous 80's movie starring Prince who battles his way from an alcoholic family and his own childhood demons to master the villianous musicians played by Morris Day and the Time. <p>That said, 8 Mile is shot well and the performances are actually quite good in parts. Eminem bags special mention -- he is in surprisingly confident form given his first attempt on the silver screen. Kim Basinger is so good as the ... mom that it makes you wonder how she channeled that performance without a little trailer park in her blood. Brittany Murphy is an exception (as usual) who fumbles around in her role like Ray Charles strapped in a Tilt-O-Whirl.<p>Although I hate rap  with a capital C, I am glad to note that the music throughout the movie is fairly enjoyable and the "rap battles" are even funny at times. Some of the scenes that have the "good guy" Eminem "winning" are actually quite engaging. <p>All in all, not a bad nightly rental given that it could have been much, much worse (think of "Cool As Ice" starring, gulp, Vanilla Ice).</p></body></html>

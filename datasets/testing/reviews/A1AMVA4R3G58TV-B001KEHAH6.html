<meta name="summary" content="I Loved This Movie !!!!"></head><body><p>Jennifer Garner is wonderful in 13 Going on 30 ! She is so believable as a young girl who wakes up to find she's turned 30 over night.<br />  The storyline and script are really funny and enjoyable, with a very heart-warming ending. This is a great movie for a Mom and young daughter to go see together - both will be able to relate to it.<br />  Even the guy I dragged along, said he was amazed at how good the movie was.<br />  Also, if you are into 80's music - this is the movie for you ! The soundtack is Excellent !</p></body></html>

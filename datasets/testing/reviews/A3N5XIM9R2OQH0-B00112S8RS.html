<meta name="summary" content="One of the decade's best thrillers"></head><body><p>Sidney Lumet's Serpico/Dog Day Afternoon heyday may be several decades behind him, but with Before the Devil Knows You're Dead he's crafted a smartly written, complicated, and ultimately gut-wrenching suspense film that doesn't pander to its audience with cheap plot twists or manufactured happy endings but instead resides squarely in the real world throughout.  If you're watching this movie in a dark frame of mind, you're in for a treat--its cynical, uncompromising view of the world and of human nature make it about as heartwarming as a Joy Division album.  Relentlessly exploring the way unintended consequences can pile up on even the most seemingly well-thought-out schemes, the movie makes a compelling case that the perfect crime is nothing more than a fantasy.  Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a welcome rarity in that it's an almost entirely character-driven thriller, a trick it manages to pull off because while it follows many of the conventions of the thriller genre, the movie remains firmly rooted in the dysfunctional relationships and day-to-day financial pressures that are a reality for all too many people.<br /><br />After a brief intro, the movie jumps right into the meat of the plot, as an attempted robbery at a mom-and-pop jewelry store in suburban New York ends up with mom and the would-be robber shooting each other to death.  It quickly emerges that the robbery was engineered by mom and pop's sons, yuppie d-bag Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and slow-witted, Fredo-esque Hank (Ethan Hawke), who mistakenly believe the family store will make an easy target and a quick fix for their respective troubles.  Each has a compelling reason for wanting to get rich quick--Hank is drowning in child-support payments to his shrewish ex-wife (Amy Ryan, excellent as always in a minor role), while Andy dreams of escaping to Brazil with his unsatisfied wife Gina (Marisa Tomei, still hot even in her 40's), who just happens to be carrying on a side affair with Hank.  Focusing mainly on the two brothers, the movie tells the main characters' stories in parallel, jumping around in time to cover the days both leading up to and following the robbery, and while this isn't exactly an innovative device at this point Lumet brilliantly exploits it to build dramatic irony and parcel out the revelations in the most organic fashion possible.<br /><br />Even if it's not always the most ambitious movie ever made, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead manages to more than get by on the intelligence and depth of its writing, directing, and acting, especially from Hawke and Hoffman as the almost comically mismatched brothers.  At times it's hard to decide which brother I wanted to punch in the face more--the weak, whiny Hank or the smug, repressed Andy--which is a testament to how believable both actors are in their roles.  While Hawke certainly holds his own, Hoffman as usual is the star of the show as Andy, a drug-abusing snake and unavailable husband who exploits people and violates the law with no apparent reservations.  In spite of his occasional moments of introspection, at bottom Andy is just a calculating, self-interested sociopath, as the movie's devastating final act makes perfectly clear, and Hoffman is perfect at making you almost feel for Andy in spite of his repugnant actions (also, his non-reaction to one of the big revelations late in the movie is beyond priceless).  In the other central role, Albert Finney turns in a legitimately moving performance as Hank and Andy's father Charles, who suddenly finds himself aimless and obsessed with revenge in the wake of his wife's death.  Finney's role doesn't appear all that substantial at first, but it eventually turns into an examination of the plight of the marginalized elderly on par with Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis's performances in the great Bubba Ho-Tep.<br /><br />Overall, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is an extremely impressive effort in a thriller genre whose releases seem to be getting increasingly interchangeable these past few years.  There's a palpable sense of foreboding that hangs over everything, which is brilliantly enhanced by Lumet's stark, unstylized direction.  The violence is pretty minimal, but what there is is suitably blunt and unflinching, and attempts to soften the characters or the world they inhabit are thankfully rare.  Best of all, it carries with it a strong moral about the folly of trying to find a quick fix for your troubles, especially when it involves trying to steal from your own family.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Groundhog Day!"></head><body><p>Harold Ramis's excellent film remains one of the best comedies of the 90s. Bill Murray is at his best as Phil Conners, a man stuck in Groundhog Day, taking his comedic routines to new heights and making the film rib-ticklingly funny. Both Murray and Ramis haven't found something as good as this since, especially Murray, whos'e wide comedic abilities are wasted in films like Charlie's Angels. But this one allows Murray to go crazy. Great film.</p></body></html>

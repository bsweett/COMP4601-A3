The DVD version with the extra disc shows how much care and thought went into developing each shot sequence.  Spielberg hired a team of futurists to help project what might be the reality in 2054 when this film is set.  As a result, we have magnetic cars that can climb up the sides of buildings and park right next to your living room.  Tom Cruise does a good job of working as the precrime director, until the precogs detail that he will commit a murder.  The supporting roles are well done.  Samantha Morton who was in Woody Allen's "Sweet & Lowdown" with Sean Penn does an excellent job as the elf-like precog Agatha whose "minority report" regarding the death of her mother is the trigger to make the plot spin apart.  TV stars have great supporting parts as "The Practice" has both Steve Harris and Spielberg's stepdaughter Jessica Capshaw as crime cops as well as Boomtown's Neal McDonough.  Colin Farrell who blew me away in "Phone Booth" does a great American accent as Danny Witwer.  Kathryn Morris has a multi-leveled role as Cruise's wife.  Lois Smith who was Aunt Meg in "Twister" does a spooky job as Dr. Iris Hineman; although why she kisses Cruise on the lips remained a mystery to me.  Max von Sydow's Lamar Burgess is brooding and deceiptful.  Philip K. Dick's short story brings interesting themes about personal privacy, identity theft and intrusion into our homes to the fore which make this a film with issues that affect us in the present.  Spielberg attempted a film noir style which he achieved with the stark cinematography.  Hearing the detail of air boosters the cops wore to fly makes you appreciate the complexity of the staging.  My impression is that this is an Alfred Hitchcock-style thriller set in the future with a high-tech film noir look.  This is a great rainy day film to have in your collection.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More adventures of Ernest "Chili" Palmer"></head><body><p>In October 1995,John Travolta delighted audiences as Ernest "Chili" Palmer in the megahit GET SHORTY. Nearly a decade later,in this film,we see Chili moving from the movie industry to the music industry. The only other GS cast member to appear in this film is Danny DeVito as film actor Martin Weir. The first encounter between Chili and Martin is at a nightclub called the Viper Room. Chili was on his way in and Martin was on his way out. At the club,Chili discovers a singer named Lynda Moon(Christina Milian) with her group called The Chicks. Chili personally appoints himself as Lynda's new business manager. But Lynda's current manager(before Chili's self-appointment) and his bodyguard are at the club also watching The Chicks in action. Lynda is currently under contract which will not expire for another five years. But Chili revokes the contract and has Lynda under a new one. Throughout the film,Chili discovers various R&B,rap and hip-hop artists and manages them. Chili's love interest(Uma Thurman) has an Aerosmith tattoo between her back and buttocks. Vince Vaughn plays Lynda's old business manager. In a later scene,Lynda is singing CRYIN' with Aerosmith(Steven Tyler,Joe Perry,Tom Hamilton,Joey Kramer and Brad Whitford). That song was one of the band's hits in 1993. Thurman's character told Chili in one scene that she once played tennis with Hamilton. She never met the other four Aerosmith members until Lynda's performance with the band. Tyler appeared in several scenes by himself. Previously,Aerosmith appeared as themselves in 1993's WAYNE'S WORLD 2. This movie was filmed over a year before its March 4,2005 theatrical release. The late Robert Pastorelli,late of TV's Murphy Brown,plays some kind of tough guy in this film. Pastorelli committed suicide in early 2004. His previous film credits include BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 and FOLKS!. Also in one of the last scenes,Lynda wins a Grammy for a song she wrote and recorded. Great performances by Cedric The Entertainer and The Rock also. I'm sorry to say that this film unlike GS,was a box office disappointment. I think it's because no one from the first film except DeVito appeared in this film. Gene Hackman,Dennis Farina,Rene Russo and David Paymer,who all appeared in GS,were all written out(their respective characters). There should be another sequel where Chili goes into the television industry. Personally,I enjoyed the film and it deserves another sequel.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The one that started it all!"></head><body><p>This is the movie that kick started the Marvel Universe Phase One. This is a awesome movie and Robert Downey Jr is the one and only Iron Man. This will be the role he is remembered for. He does a excellent job playing Tony Stark. I had this movie on DVD, but it was on sell at Walmart for 10 dollars on blu ray, so I picked out up along with The Avengers 3D blu ray, and if you haven't seen The Avengers yet be sure to do that, it is a can't miss movie. Back to Iron Man, the blu ray version looks very nice and was well worth the upgrade. I enjoy the story line of IM1 a little more than IM2. I am not saying IM2 is a bad movie, cause it is not, I just enjoyed seeing how Tony Stark progressed into Iron Man. The action in this movie is fantastic and the CGI is incredible! I think the CGI along with Downey's performance is what really makes this movie believable. If you haven't seen this yet, make sure you do, you don't want to miss out on this blockbuster, and if you are wondering if you should upgrade, if you can find it for a reasonable price go ahead, you won't be disappointed!</p></body></html>

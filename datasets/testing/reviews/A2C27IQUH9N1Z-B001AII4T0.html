<meta name="summary" content="cautionary tale about nuclear terror -- with a GREAT cast"></head><body><p>Yikes, I'm really surprised at the negative reviews here.  I haven't read the Clancy books so I had no preconceived notions, but I have enjoyed the earlier Jack Ryan films with Harrison Ford, and I HAVE seen many supposed thrillers lately that were extremely disappointing.  This is the first thriller I've enjoyed in a long time.  I thought the script was very good, the acting from top to bottom was superb, and the editing kept the many plot threads clear.<p>After Harrison Ford dropped out of this project and Ben Affleck expressed an interest in playing the lead, the script was revamped to show Jack Ryan at the beginning of his career.  In that capacity, as an intelligent neophyte, he meets his CIA mentor (Morgan Freeman), first ventures out with a seasoned field operative (Liev Schreiber), begins courting his future wife (Bridget Moynahan), advises the president (James Cromwell) for the first time, and meets the Russian president (Ciaran Hinds).  This is a very interesting time in the career of a beloved character, and the writers got it right and Affleck does a very good job here.  The villains are played by Alan Bates and Colm Feore.  What a fabulous cast!<p>Special features include two commentary tracks - one with the director and cinematographer and one with the director and author; meaty featurettes about the casting, production and special effects; a trailer; an on-the-set featurette.  The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available only in English.<p>If you like exciting techno-thrillers and are not a Tom Clancy or Harrison Ford purist, give this film a chance.  It's terrific, and I hope they'll make more.  I'm not sure why some people didn't like it but I respectfully, and heartily, disagree with them.</p></body></html>

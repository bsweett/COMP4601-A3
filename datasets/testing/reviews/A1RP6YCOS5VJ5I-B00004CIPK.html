The action is fast-paced and there is no stoping it once it gets started. Bruce Willis does an excellent job in this film as the hero, it's easy to see how he became a huge success after this film. My hat's off to Alan Rickman as well, his portrayal of the villian was as equally impressive. This film is the definition of exciting and after all of these years, the movie is still as fresh as it was when it was originall released. This isn't your typical 80's action flick, this movie has a staying power that will be popular for generations to come! It's very well made, exciting adventure that you have to see if you haven't already!</p></body></html>

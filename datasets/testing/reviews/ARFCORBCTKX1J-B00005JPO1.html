But I understand why so many fans were disappointed.<br /><br />As others have said, it's not fair to condemn Indy's "refrigerator escape" without also criticizing all the other silly gags in the films (they are, after all, supposed to be tongue-in-cheek homages/parodies), most notably the "life-raft escape" in #2. Indy, Willie, and Short Round /should/ have been killed (or at least had their hips rammed into their jaws), * but it /looked/ plausible. Sort of. The "refrigerator escape" so obviously crossed the line of plausibility that audiences rejected it. (I have no problems with CGI prairie dogs, however.)<br /><br />"KCS"'s main problem is that, unlike the other films, there is no specific item -- the Ark, the stones, the Grail -- to drive and motivate the plot. Instead, he and the others are headed someone to find something that might be of interest. We've already seen the powers of the Crystal Skull, so why should we remain interested? And we're told so much about what to expect that the climax isn't much of a payoff. (And it isn't very exciting, either.) The result is an adventure film lacking the tension such films need. The whole thing has a set-piece "concocted" quality.<br /><br />The Blu-ray Disk comes in a nice little hard-back book with production photos. It's not a big deal, but it's nice to see this sort of deluxe packaging, which other companies seem to be adopting. (Maybe they're trying to maintain the price of BDs.)<br /><br />Now, how about the first three disks in good BD editions?<br /><br />* I recently met a retired Army man whose chute failed to open -- and whose legs were so badly injured he's now 3" shorter than he used to be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Actually, yes!"></head><body><p>This is a different sort of Romantic comedy that tends to take one by surprise.  Featuring the talent of Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightly, it is also more star-studded than most RC movies I have seen.<br /><br />The film is like a collage of stories of several couples.  The way the plot progresses reminded me a little bit of the drama PLAYING BY HEART.  We are able to view myriad short-stories that are all interwined (in one way other) to form a cohesive whole.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of flicks in the RC genre, this one is not afraid to engage in political satire.  Set in Britain, the writers taken some not-so-subtle "shots" at both the Clinton and Bush(jr) administrations.  Fans of either Clinton or Bush are likely to be miffed, while detractors of both are sure to be gleeful.<br /><br />If you want to different kind of heartwarming drama / comedy, you might actually find some love here.  It's worth taking the chance, anyway!</p></body></html>

He's charismatic, intelligent and something of a major bad-ass. He's also now, after three appearances in the X-Men films, showing his claws in his own movie, X-Men Origins: Wolverine.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman tears up the screen as the title character, proving that he's more than capable of driving the movie by himself. He brings some real screen presence to the film, and that's good, cause if he didn't it would likely have sunk under its own weight and not been even watchable. As it is, the film is actually pretty good, though not great.<br /><br />The movie starts with young Logan in 1840's as he comes of age in the Northern Territories of Canada (though as Roger Ebert pointed out, neither such entity existed in the 1840's). He's a sickly lad made somewhat better by killing his father. He then embarks on a dramatic opening credits sequence showing him and his brother, Victor, as they fight their way through virtually every major war (on the American side, oddly. I guess Canada doesn't have enough wars for them to be interested. Also, this may be the only movie I've ever seen where large parts took place in Canada but were filmed elsewhere).<br /><br />After the credits we see Logan and his brother (now played by Liev Schreiber, who is almost as compelling a presence as Hugh Jackman), teaming up with a bunch of other mutants to... I'm not entirely clear what they were supposed to be doing, actually. They seem to end up being a private army for one Major Stryker (played by Danny Houston, who isn't nearly as interesting as Brian Cox). After some nastiness in Nigeria, Logan decides to part company with his team and goes back to Canada. He settles down there until the movie decides it's time for him to get back into action and then, as they say, hilarity ensues. Or something.<br /><br />We do get appearances by various characters from the Marvel universe, including Wolverine and Sabertooth, but also Deadpool, Silverfox, the Blob and Gambit, as well as a young Cyclops and a young... well, that would spoil a surprise.<br /><br />The plot isn't really much of much here, though it does do a good job of establishing where Wolverine came from. The action scenes are serviceable (although I have to say two immortals trying to fight each other to the death seems really, really pointless), and get the job done, though the SFX is mediocre at times (and Wolverine's metal claws look really fake compared to what he had in the X-Men films). The acting is decent by pretty much everyone (though the guy who plays Gambit has a very unconvincing accent. Really hot, though).<br /><br />The setting of the film is also somewhat confusing, since most of the movie takes place in the late 1970's, but you wouldn't know that unless the movie told you. Several of the shots, especially with crowds, look like they take place now rather than then.<br /><br />This isn't a great movie, but it is a decent one and a good enough way to pass the time. If you go in with fairly low expectations, you'll likely have a good time. At the very least, it's much, much better than X-Men 3.<br /><br />Now next let's have an Alpha Flight movie!</p></body></html>

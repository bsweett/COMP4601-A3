<meta name="summary" content="Good film, slowed down a bit"></head><body><p>I think the concept of this film was interesting.  I enjoyed the film but at times I felt it was a little slow.  It was good, I was expecting something different the way some of the critics panned the film but it was a good film.  It's one of those films you might want to watch once or twice to really get it.  I enjoyed it although after Evan made the first altering change the film slowed down a bit.</p></body></html>

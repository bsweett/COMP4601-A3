<meta name="summary" content="Needlessly incoherent , and corny-heroic"></head><body><p>I really thought I would like this movie, based in part on its supposed expose of evil corporate workings (I am of the belief that the main reason the world is getting more dysfunctional and self-destructive by the day is because the corporations have pretty much taken over most of the global power apparatus), and on its nearly 90% positive rating on rottentomatoes dot com.  In fact, I really WANTED to like this movie.<br /><br />Instead I found myself increasingly frustrated with the needlessly incoherent/circular/fragmented plot presentation of the first 2/3rds of the movie, and the sudden and implausible hero-making of the last 1/3rd of the movie.  Very clumsy, uneven storytelling that relies on a non-linear plot structure to create suspense and retain viewer interest, then whacks you with a happy ending that is way too neat and easy.  Tilda Swinton is excellent as usual, though in this film she seems deliberately made to look like a stuffed cadaver as befits her character, rather than her exquisite natural beauty.  Clooney, Wilkinson, and Pollack all put in solid performances too.<br /><br />It reminds me a bit of "Good Night, and Good Luck" which Clooney both starred in and directed.  Good intentions + weak storytelling = dull, preachy movie.</p></body></html>

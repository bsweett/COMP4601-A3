One sequence, probably one of the most memorable in all cinema history, is the "Layla" scene. For those who have seen it, no explanation is needed. What one sees on the screen is repulsive, disgusting, but at the same time, it is beautiful. The movie has too many cuss words and too much violence, but all of that can be forgetten because the director keeps such intensity that one is simply swept off their feet.</p></body></html>

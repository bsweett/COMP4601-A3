<meta name="summary" content="This Flick Needed Mink Stole"></head><body><p>This version of "Hairspray" is a pleasant enough diversion but it doesn't hold a candle to John Waters' original version from 1988.  Waters, with a lower budget, was able to deliver high octane entertainment on a grander scale.  What this flick lacks is any coherent style from director Adam Shankman.  It seems to be a paint-by-numbers affair that barely rises above the mundane.  What's also glaring is Shankman bludgeons the film's anti-segregation message to the point of noxious preachiness.  Waters was able to get the point across in the original with more subtlety.  Imagine that:  John Waters accused of subtlety.  The songs are generally good but are no match for the r'n'b chestnuts that Waters scored his film with.  What elevates the film is the highly energetic turns by the cast assembled here.  John Travolta, as Edna Turnblad, makes the character his own and makes you almost forget Divine's superb turn in the original.  I smell at least Oscar nomination here.  Though Christopher Walken has limited screen time he makes the most of it particularly in a number performed with Travolta.  Michelle Pfeiffer drips malevolence as the whitebread TV station manager.  Nikki Blonsky is a revelation who opens the film on a promisingly energetic note with her rendition of "Good Morning, Baltimore".  Not bad but not all it could have been.</p></body></html>

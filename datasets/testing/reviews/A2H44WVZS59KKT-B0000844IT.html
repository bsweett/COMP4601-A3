When I'm feeling the need for a popcorn and beer nuts lollapalooza movie night, I pull out "Army of Darkness" and invite over my demented friends, neighbors and family for a good laugh.<br /><br />Groovy Bruce is at his kookiest best as Ash, Housewares, S-Mart, battling the Deadites and trying to stay alive in the 1300s, after dropping into the past with his beat up Oldsmobile, his chainsaw prosthesis hand and his Remington shotgun.<br /><br />He fights skeletons carrying swords, saves himself with his chainsaw hand, has a whirlwind romance with Sheila, played by Embeth Davidtz, and just generally drops some of the funniest one-liners ever and works on creating gallons of blood and guts.<br /><br />Looking for a movie that will bring a grin (albeit deranged) to your face? This is it.</p></body></html>

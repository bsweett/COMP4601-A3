The lost time was caused by Banek cutting off Gibson on the FDR (I'm a former NY'er and I've had this happen to me!!!)  Doyle wants to do the right thing and exchange information, while Banek just wants to give him a blank check and be gone.  Banek is in such a rush he does not realize that he lost a file for the court case he is on his way to.  To get back at Banek Doyle holds the important file hostage!!!  This starts a series of events that just sets of a domino effect of I'm going to do you worse!!! Closing accounts, threatening phone calls, and possibly worse!!<p>The movie is about morals, and doing the right thing.  The movie was not great, but it held my interest.</p></body></html>

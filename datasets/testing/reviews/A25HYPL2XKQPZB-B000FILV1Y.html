<meta name="summary" content="Movie funny inspite of its flaws..."></head><body><p>In spite of the fact that Sarah Jessica Parker is not an attractive woman, the plot is uninspired, and the romantic leads have no chemistry, this movie was still funny.<br /><br />Flipp (Matthew McCaugheny) still lives with his parents, and they want him out.  His parents hire Sarah Jessica Parker to get him out.  She specializes in this kind of service and has a funny scene with a star wars fan who still lives at home.  Parker meets flip and she falls for him, so he tries to dump her and the movie goes around and around.  There isn't much romance here, but the quirky supporting cast and inspired scenes of comedy (the mocking bird in the house is my favorite)<br /><br />The cast is actually good, so they carry the movie through the weak parts.  The friends of Matthew McCaugheny and Parker are the best.  Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha all have moments to shine.<br /><br />This is one of the better romantic comedies recently.  It is stronger on comedy than romance, but you should get some good laughs out of it.  The language was kind of rough for a PG-13 and it does have nudity (of Terry Bradshaw's backside) so this movie may not be good for kids.</p></body></html>

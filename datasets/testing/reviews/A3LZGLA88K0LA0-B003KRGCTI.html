<meta name="summary" content="ELI'S COMING"></head><body><p>A bleak post-apocalyptic world provides the backdrop for this competent film.  Well-directed by the Hughes Brothers, the movie relies on essential goodness of mankind and an effectively balanced performance by the ever reliable Denzel Washington.  Also the strong support from villains Gary Oldman and Ray Stevenson; Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals and an uncredited cameo from Malcolm McDowell.<br />The sepia tone enhances the barren landscape and Eli's mysterious secret is well preserved.  One of the better films of this genre in recent years.</p></body></html>

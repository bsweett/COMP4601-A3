<meta name="summary" content="Astonishing, Terrific Musical Raises the Bar..."></head><body><p>For a generation, the only Beatles-themed musical was the abysmal "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", and, truthfully, I feared director Julie Taymor's "Across the Universe" wouldn't be much better...but happily, I was wrong. This is a remarkable, multi-layered rock tribute of an era that not only homages the music of the Fab Four, but may just be the finest musical in years!<br /><br />Closer in spirit to Milos Forman's "Hair" and Ken Russell's 70's extravaganzas, the story of Jude, a lad from Liverpool (Jim Sturgess), his American friend, Max, a footloose anarchist Ivy Leaguer (Joe Anderson), and Max's sister, Lucy, a pampered rich girl (Evan Rachel Wood), echoes Forman's exuberance in recapturing the spirit of revelation, experimentation, and disillusionment that was the heart of the 1960s. The trio winds up in a Bohemian, free-spirited Manhattan, bonding with Joplin-esque singer, Sadie (Dana Fuchs), Hendrix-inspired rocker, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy), and sensitive lesbian, Prudence (T.V. Carpio). This opening third of the movie is so exuberant and heartfelt that you may catch yourself singing along to Beatles' anthems like "A Little Help from My Friends" and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand".<br /><br />The film nearly loses itself in Russell-like visual overkill as it slides into the psychedelic drug culture, personified by acid guru Dr. Robert (Bono), and counter-culture showman, Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard), but Vietnam, race riots, and the anti-war movement restores a balance to the story, with a moving rooftop finale reminiscent of the climax of the Beatles' final film, "Let It Be".<br /><br />After the grim, off-kilter musical, "Chicago", it is refreshing to see a film combine music and story in a celebration of life and love. The cast sings Lennon/McCartney and Harrison superbly, the choreography of the big production numbers is inventive and often amusing, and, best of all, there is a youthful optimism and energy in every aspect of the production that is infectious.<br /><br />"Across the Universe" proves movie musicals aren't dead, they only need the right inspiration...This is a film you can cherish!</p></body></html>

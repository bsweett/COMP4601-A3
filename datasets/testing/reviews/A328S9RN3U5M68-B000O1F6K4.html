Despite the fact that there is an incredible amount of violence, blood, explosions, and other forms of daring-do, Robert Rodriguez has such a good time galloping along on this adventure that it is difficult not to enjoy the ride. The sets and special effects are a terrific background for this hero adventure of El Mariachi, played to sheer perfection by Antonio Banderas.  His sidekicks  are the underused Marco Leonardi and Enrique Iglesias, the female pulcritude is handled with panache by Salma Hayek and Eva Mendes, and once again stealing every scene in which he appears the multitalented Johnny Depp proves that he is one of the finest sophisticated comic actors on the screen today.  All of the cast members (including Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Willem Defoe, Mickey Rourke, etc) offer excellent cameos.  Everything about this &quot;Mexican style&quot; 'Italian Western' of Sergio Leone's style works. Yes, everything is in excess, but that is the joy of the spoof of it all.  Sit back and just enjoy!</p></body></html>

However, thanks to King's brilliant storytelling, a human element is introduced into the mix that takes the film to new psychological heights.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Mist" tells the tale of a small American town suddenly attacked by a variety of bug-like creatures.  After a terrible windstorm causes the town's residents to gather in the general store for supplies, they all find themselves trapped in the rather confined space as a curtain of mist blankets the entire city.  Whenever someone ventures out into the mist, however, they do not return alive.<br /><br />There are two reasons why this film is so interesting/entertaining:<br /><br />First, the special effects and alien creatures will have you on the edge of your seat.  One almost has to wonder if they did not inspire JJ Abrams' creature in the later "Cloverfield" picture, as the films are very similar in that regard.<br /><br />What truly sets the film apart, though, is that it is as much about humanity as it is about monsters.  As the bewildered townspeople struggle to determine their next move, all their personalities begin showing in crisis mode.  There is the religious zealot, the rednecks ready to fight at the drop of the hat, the natural leaders, and the "lemmings" willing to follow the loudest voice in a mob-like mentality.  In typical King fashion, it is a tale of humanity's struggles more than the paranormal aspect.<br /><br />Overall, then, "The Mist" is a great "monster flick" also including large doses of human drama.  It was a great Stephen King story, and the transfer to the big screen is almost impeccable.  Unless you are a bit squeamish, you will find this interesting on both the "horror" & "psychological" levels.</p></body></html>

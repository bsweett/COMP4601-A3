<meta name="summary" content="Average + Anticlimactic = Dull"></head><body><p>The Forgotten is a psychological conspiracy thriller about a mother's quest to find out the truth behind her deceased son from whom the rest of the world tells her never existed. At best, there's a few "thrilling" parts to it, including probably the best and most effective car crash I've ever seen in a movie, a couple of kinda freaky parts with people being sucked into the sky and an alright idea for a story. At worst, a lot of the dialogue in the movie just flat out seemed phony to me, especially in the early scenes where Telly (Julianne Moore) is freaking out on her husband for changing the picture and freaking out on her psychiatrist for telling her that her son Sam never existed. This rather cheesy dialogue in this early of the movie made the rest of the film hard to take seriously.<br /><br />The biggest drawback in the movie for me was its anticlimactic ending. Very non exciting and predictable. I watched the ending of the extended version with the alternate ending hoping that maybe it was just the studio's fault for producing such a weak ending, but I honestly couldn't tell any difference between the theatrical ending which I just watched and the alternate ending. So all in all, offers a couple of okay moments for a thriller, but is just too dull and anticlimactical for my taste.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Takes the vampire genre to new levels"></head><body><p>I was going to say refreshingly new levels, as in the creative sense, but the word &quot;refreshing&quot; might not exactly work in this movie.  For this is a bloody, gory, sadistic piece of art that gets down and dirty from the starting gate, and never lets go.  It's really a terrific movie.<p>Why?  Two reasons.  First, the special effects.  I've written in other reviews how I can give or take them.  Sometimes they help, sometimes I find them annoying.  A good movie still depends on plot, and if it's all special effects, no matter how good, there will be always something missing from the movie.  In this movie, they are not only good, as in the fight scenes, which convey the speed and agility of super beings fighting each other.  But they are also essential to the plot, which is reason two. <p>We are used to vampires being the bad guys, and this also remains for this flick.  But the story takes a plot twist when Blade and his mortal vampire enemies find themselves uneasy allies.  Why?  Because an even more terrifying and powerful breed of monster has evolved.  This new breed is kind of like a vampire, but, and this is where it becomes art, has powers and physical abilities that make the &quot;regular&quot; vampires look wimpy.  Part of these physical abilities are very realistically shown via the special effects, and therefore essential to the plot.  <p>I will not reveal what these new abilities are, but if you like you vampires gory, sadistic, and bloody, this one's for you.  And yes, there is even some good plot thrown in, as the previously mortal enemies are forced to work together.  There is also the return of Kris Kristofferson, who has been rescued from the vampires, but must be watched to see which side of the fence he's going to be playing on.  <p>Overall, one of the best action sequels ever made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Strong third and final entry in franchise review of 1 and 2 disc editions"></head><body><p>***Warning the first paragraph might contain some spoilers***<br /><br />Ethan Hawke (Tom Cruise) stands at the crossroads in "Mission : Impossible 3". He's left field work but gets pulled back in when Lindsay (Kerri Russell) one of his former students is captured by arms dealer Owen Davian (a deliciously nasty Phillip Seymour Hoffman). It seems that Lindsay discovered that there may be a mole helping Davian within IMF. Now Hawke once again finds himself in the field trying to bring down Davian, discover who the mole might be and protect his fianc&eacute;e Michelle Monaghan) from torture and death.<br /><br />Regardless of the fall out from all of Tom Cruise's issues and antics J. J. Abrams'("Lost", "Alias" and writer of the film "Regarding Henry", writer/director of the forthcoming "Star Trek XI" prequel) crafts a spy thriller almost worthy of Hitchcock with its use of the McGuffin (the "Rabbit's Foot" a dangerous weapon of war that Davian plans on selling to North Korea) and a number of marvelous set pieces that would make Brian De Palma and John Woo proud. Interestingly the third film in the series combines elements of the first two films with Hawke's search for the mole within IMF and the scenic stylish almost surreal action pieces created for the film.<br /><br />We get almost as much variety for this release as you get donuts in a donut shop. The single disc edition features a limited number of features including director Abrams and star Cruise in a commentary track. Abrams discusses everything from his McGuffin (which he considers something of a joke) to Cruise's stunts during the action sequences. It's a solid commentary track.<br /><br />The single disc edition also includes "The Making of the Mission" featurette, deleted scenes, and the indulgent BAFTA "Excellent in Film" montage allowing us to see why Cruise deserved to be patted on the back as well as a selection of trailers.<br /><br />The two disc edition includes everything the single disc edition has plus "Inside the IMF" and "Mission Action: Inside the Action Unit" that run nearly 40 minutes. "Visualizing the Mission", "Mission Metamorphosis" and "Scoring the Mission" give insight of the production of the film from pre-production through post-production.<br /><br />The 5 part "Launching the Mission" provides an excellent overview on the production of the film. "Moviefone Unscripted: Cruise/Abrams" features the two discussing the movie from an internet "event" while "Generation: Cruise" really is nothing more than an indulgent ego stroking montage from the MTV Movie Awards. Things are rounded up with trailers and TV spots for the film. We also get four Easter Eggs that are pretty easy to find on disc two.<br /><br />Paramount does a nice sent off for the swan song mission of Cruise and the studio together. Although the business and quality of the film was overshadowed by Cruise's idiotic behavior "Mission: Impossible III" overcomes these obstacles with an enjoyable thriller. Hoffman is top notch and the return of Ving Rhames as Luther is always welcome. Perhaps Paramount can built a fourth franchise film around Rhames and bring in another actor to replace Cruise. Either way Abrams crafts an enjoyable adventure for fans and reinvigorates the slumping series by returning to a style that is reminiscent of De Palma's first film on steroids.</p></body></html>

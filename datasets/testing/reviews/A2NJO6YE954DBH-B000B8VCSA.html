I am not sure if the credit for the pluses goes more to novelist Robert Ludlum for the novel "The Bourne Supremacy" or to Tony Gilroy for the screenplay, but I know that the writing is the best part of this summer 2004 thriller. I have not read any of Ludlum's books, but I know Gilroy did the adaptation of "Dolores Claiborne," so it could be either of them. I also know that the parts of the film that take away from "The Bourne Supremacy" can be laid at the feet of director Paul Greengrass.<br /><br />The one thing we know about a Jason Bourne film, as opposed to a James Bond film, is that somebody is always out to see him dead. Bond as least has a mission that has people trying to kill him; Bourne is on a hit list just by breathing. Matt Damon plays Bourne with a understatement that marks him apart from the rest of his secret agent brethren, and which also serves to emphasize the strength of the script. Introduced to the character as a badly wounded body floating in the Mediterranean who did not remember who he was, Bourne survived his first film never finding out his real name, just his identity as Jason Bourne, and dropped off the face of the earth to try and live happily ever after with Marie (Franka Potente), his unwilling ally and now only confidante.<br /><br />Of course, they are doomed, and Bourne goes off to get the people who are trying to get him. This becomes somewhat confusing because the people out to get him on one continent are not same people trying to get him on all the other ones. But the important thing is that Bourne goes off to deliver payback and what is great about this character is his economy of effort. Jason Bourne can create a time bomb in thirty seconds using only three things and in his hands a bottle of vodka has a multitude of uses. Every time he gets into a sticky situation you know he is going to doing something smart and he is going to do it quickly. The intelligence of the character and the script is the strongest part of the movie.<br /><br />But at the same time the script is delighting my brain director Paul Greengrass is trying to turn my stomach. Too much of this film is done by a hand-held camera, rarely to any great effect. Then there are the smash cuts and heavy editing of the fight scenes. What is the good of choreographing a one-on-one fight scene if all we get are quick impressions of what is going on. Then Greengrass starts throwing things together, so that we have hand-held shots of moving people cut at warp speed. This gets a bit disorienting at times and can provoke feelings of queasiness. But Bourne's intelligence overcome these visual liabilities.<br /><br />Bourne is also the smartest person in the film, something it take CIA station chief Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) a while to understand, even though Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nicolette (Julia Stiles) both explain this to her repeatedly. The end game of the film actually has a series of levels, so that it is not a simple thing to get everything resolved, and Bourne does have a hand in everything that happens. There is a strong thread of realism going throughout the impossible situations, but that is why the future of the Bourne series is different from the fate of the Bond flicks. "The Bourne Supremacy" also gets points for the scenes in the movie that we see in the trailer are better in the movie than they are when cut together in the trailer.</p></body></html>

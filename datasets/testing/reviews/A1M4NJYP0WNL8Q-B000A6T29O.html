Lord Croft's disappearance and presumed death had hurt her badly, and she had spent her life so far in a desperate quest to be what her father wanted her to be, a great field archeologist, Britain's answer to Indiana Jones.<p>Within the clock is yet another, this one the key to unlock the two pieces of the Pyramid of Light.  And the holder of the Pyramid can warp time.  Lara can return to her father and discover the cause of his disappearance.  Or the Illuminati can take over the world.  To prevent this Lara must outwit and outmuscle Powell (Iain Glen) the conspiracies agent.  And keep her old friend Alex West (Daniel Craig) from selling her out.  <p>Based on the computer game series by Eidos Interactive, Jolie's Lara is smart, sexy, and tough as nails.  The actress spent three months in hard physical training for the part and performed many of her own stunts.  Of course, this isn't the kind of film where great acting is to be expected.  But all the characters, from Lara's eccentric assistant Bryce (Noah Taylor) right through to the star herself turn in solid, professional performances.  If the dialog isn't brilliant, at least it isn't stupid.  Of course, the real stars of the film aren't the humans but the technical teams.<p>I hardly thought that, when I first read Shea and Wilson's 'Illuminatus Trilogy' some thirty years ago, that I would find myself watching astonishing adventures of at heroine of a computer game in a race against time to save the world.  Completely new technologies would have to come into being before this was possible.  Back then, the closest thing to a real time game was an anemic version of Star Trek, and the only adventure game had you chasing (very slowly) through a few dozen 'twisty little passages.'  Taken from that viewpoint, the spectacular visuals of 'Tomb Raider' are a testimonial to the state of animation and special effects.  <p>The film is meant to be fun, and a recreation in 'reality' of a computer game world, and does that perfectly.  Lara, as a woman, succeeds in a world where we once thought only men had a place.  Even so, almost every other actor in the film is male, the next longest female role being the bit part of a Cambodian girl (Ayla Amiral), who points out the entrance to one of the lost tombs.  Angelina is literally 'without competition.'  Even with a new Lara Croft film in the offing, this one will be tough to beat.<p>The requisite extras are provided on the DVD.  Features on visual effects, Angelina Jolie, the computer game, Angelina Jolie, the director's commentary, and (of course) Angelina Jolie.</p></body></html>

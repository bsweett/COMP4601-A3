<meta name="summary" content="A Surprise...of the Good Kind!"></head><body><p>Reviewing films encourages following the opinions of fellow reviewers whose thoughts nail movies dead center: often reading reviews by certain reviewers encourages or discourages this reviewer regarding a controversial film.  Reading some thoughts about how particularly disappointing this film  almost precludes watching it: happily a coincidence encouraged viewing such a film that for this viewer was fascinating and satisfying.<br /><br />The production crew of this thriller worked overtime to make a style: the film is filled with metaphorical circles in the wallpaper, the decor, the steps, the room designs - each pointing a sturdy finger to the story's meaning from the very beginning.  But along the way the writing and pacing of this high-octane film zoom past the eye with twists, turns, interlocked relationships, and character development that waits for the end for the payoff.  To say more would probably alter the good chase fun the movie provides in its ending.<br /><br />The film is one of the bloodiest and goriest of the season, but it all serves the purpose of exposing crime at its pinnacle. The good guys are difficult to separate from the bad guys in this case of mistaken identity that spurs mayhem.  But the cast is at all times stylishly active: Josh Harnett, Lucy Liu, Danny Aiello, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Chamberlin, Dorian Missick, Mykelti Williamson, and of course Bruce Willis.  There are some holes in the plot but the action is so well paced that they are inconsequential,  and for this viewer the end justifies the means.  A surprisingly and unexpectedly good evening's entertainment!  Grady Harp, September 06</p></body></html>

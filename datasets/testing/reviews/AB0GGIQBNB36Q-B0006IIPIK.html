This movie deserves more than five stars, I was reminded of the serials of the 30's and 40's. Like "Spy Smasher" and "The Phantom". Some people say Jude Law was overacting, well in a moving like this. Which is an obvious homage to those serials, guess what. Overacting is expected, this movie is pure popcorn fun, I won't go into the plot since that's already been done a thousand times. I was surprised to see the Titanic make an appearance in this movie, again I liked it. I wish they would make a sequel, and just like Spy Smasher. Sky Captain saves us from the evil Doctor, Or was the evil doctor behind it all. You'll have to get the movie to find out, I can assure you. You won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

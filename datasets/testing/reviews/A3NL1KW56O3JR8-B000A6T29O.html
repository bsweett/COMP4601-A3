<meta name="summary" content="What can you expect?"></head><body><p>I guess you can't really expect much from a movie based on a video-game. There are plenty of fanciful actions scenes (how do they always seem to miss point-blank with automatic weapons?...) but not much of a plot to speak of. Silly story; sub-par movie.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

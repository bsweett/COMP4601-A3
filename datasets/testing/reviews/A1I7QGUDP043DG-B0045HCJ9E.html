His kidnappers are good at covering their tracks and even Thornhill doesn't realize that George Kaplan doesn't really exist! Thornhill (played by Carey Grant) must find out who Kaplan is, what the bad guys want with him and how to clear his own name in a murder he didn't commit. There are great 'one-liners' and an unforgettable plane/human chase that helps this movie stand out as one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

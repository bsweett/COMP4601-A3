<meta name="summary" content="Half Satisfying"></head><body><p>Some things made this movie OK and some things made it kind of annoying.  Bad first.  Christian Bale, what a boar.  His whole presence is kind of loathsome and false.  If there was a sympathetic character it would be Hugh Jackman's character.  So I found it rather disappointing in the end that he loses and not the other way around.  A rather unsatisfying ending that lacks justice, considering that Bale's character starts the whole feud initially by carelessly causing Jackman's wife's death.  Gonna have to throw Caine's performance in with that of Bale's as well.  I was not impressed by the acting and the crappy English accents.  The story however has moments of interest of the kind that decent science fiction is likely to arouse.  David Bowie actually put in a pretty good performance as Dr Tesla.  If there was a was a hero I'd have thought it to be Jackman's character.  I actually could stand watching him (unlike Bale and often Caine whose characters just seemed so "put on" and finally just annoying).  Anyway, 3 stars for acting.  The story (minus the lame ending) I actually give 4 stars as I liked the injection of real sci-fi (in the name of "science" of course) into the mix and it raised philosophical questions about the ethics of "murdering an immediate and exact replica of yourself" - do you have the right to do it?  The movie seems to tell us no and perhaps they are right.  Fortunately science hasn't advanced to the stage where immediate clones are a possibility, but it does make you think a little (and only a little).  So the flimsy concept of the movie is half entertaining though still a bit longish at times.  I'd have forgiven the longishness if the acting (and accents) had been more worthwhile, but there was only so much of the Christian Bale character's nonsense that I could take which made those longish moments all the longer.<br /><br />It's a half decent film with some entertainment value, but if it won any awards for acting I would be extremely surprised.</p></body></html>

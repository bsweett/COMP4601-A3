<meta name="summary" content="One of the most succesful films made"></head><body><p>Star Wars was a film that not only succeeded as an entertainment but was a breakthrough. It was film that brought Science Fiction into the main stream. It also changed the role of female leads. Before Star Wars the role of the female lead in an adventure flick was to be rescued. To hang around looking tense until a male character sorted things out. Star Wars had a heroine who not only grabbed a gun and started shooting, but who was no stranger to control and exercising authority. The film also had one of the more original villains, Darth Vader.<br /><br />At the time the films success was seen to be the result of state of the art special effects. But the reality is that on top of the effects there was a tightly written script with dialogue that contained some humour and wit. The musical score was also important in developing the mood of the film. It has one of the most effective scores since Siegfried.<br /><br />Yet the success of the film lies in the plot density and the degree of invention and originality of scenes. If one looks at modern science fiction or action films it is unusual to see the degree of invention that occurred with Star Wars. Consider for instance the franchise competitor Star Treck. Star Treck films usually show a mock up of a space craft and then scenes set on something which looks like earth. Blade runner used the one set. Star Wars opens up in space but after that it does not stop. Lucas is a director who excels in tableaux.  With characters we open with Darth Vader but we quickly move on to two robots who will be the main vehicle for developing the plot. Shortly after we have a race of dwarf mechanics, sandmen and their animals, a bar full of strange musicians, a weird enforcer. The settings move from space to a desert planet and back to space. The visual variety of the film and the plot density more than cover any of the weakness of the dialogue.<br /><br />The film is also set in a rational universe. A central government is trying to exsert control over what was once a less authoritarian system. It is using military force to subdue the parts of what was a republic so that an empire can be consolidated. The plot is centred on the deployment of a weapon so powerful that it can decisively tip the balance in favour of the emperor who we do not see but only hear about.  Of course it was unusual that the events which occurred so long ago in a galaxy so far away so mimic out history. The term emperor for instance was one invented by Rome's first emperor Augustus. He used it as a propaganda move to avoid the hostility to the term king. Princess is another one of Augustus' inventions but developed later to refer to an emperor in training after the Empire was split into a Western and Eastern Section. However one should not be to picky in looking at the semantics of a film.<br /><br />It is interesting in the light of subsequent films that Darth Vader at this point does not seem that important. He takes orders from a character called Grand Moff Tarkin. Darth Vader has certain supernatural powers. He can strangle people through a thought process. However he is a person who appears to be on the way out. The other characters ridicule him in one scene and it appears a world in which technology is dominant and his skills are no longer in demand.<br /><br />The end of the film was based on the battle of Britain. Lucas apparently used historical footage of second World War aerial dog fights to set up the last scene. It is a ants v elephants battle in which the ants through the use of careful targeting are victorious.<br /><br />At the end of the film the empire's special weapon has been destroyed, one of he main characters who appeared initially somewhat self-centred has shown his devotion to a higher duty and all the plot strands have been tied up except for Darth Vader who has lived to set up a sequel.</p></body></html>

In the meantime, an ancient Egyptian demon wants to suck the souls out of the old and sickly folks, so it's up to Elvis and Jack to stop the demon.<br />Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are great.  But somehow, the story lacks the sense of urgency that a horror tale should have, and although there are many funny lines, it could have been stronger comedically.  The writer/director also seems to borrow heavily from the works of the Raimi brothers and their friends the Coen Brothers instead of being more original.<br />Okay for a few laughs, but not as good as it might have been.</p></body></html>

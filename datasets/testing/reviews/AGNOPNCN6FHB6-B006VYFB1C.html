Billy was right about only the last game counts.... the way the players are traded so easily like their card counterparts created compassion as well as how underrated athletes were used to average team weakness, amazing insight for a simple fan on the cold hard statistics to finely tune a winning team...  I craved more coverage of the details as they only hinted at the complexities, i.e. one simple equation in initial report and smash cut scans over 2D tables, just a few more discussions citing correlations for player selection would provide compelling insight into the significance of changing the game forever...  the crazed phone trading scheme was over the top to appreciate, can't imagine this scene represented much difference in negotiations but perhaps an omage to the old ways? not sure if this information improves my appreciation for a game that has drama, personalities, surprises, etc.  hence, to optimize sabermetrics may lose that intrinsic love of the game and move inherently towards a more robotic emotionless competition, trying to compare with another sport, oh yeah pro football...</p></body></html>

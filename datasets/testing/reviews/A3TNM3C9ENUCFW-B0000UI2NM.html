<meta name="summary" content="Underrated Slick Thriller"></head><body><p>This film was fairly heavily panned by the critics when it opened in September 2003 and I feel undeservedly so, for it is a highly watchable, if uninventive piece of cinema.<br />Kate Beckinsale plays a Vampire whose job is to hunt and kill Lychens (Werewolves) the sworn enemy of her coven, and her kind. The film has a distinctly European feel, not only in the locations, but also direction but moves at a good pace, keeping the viewer awake and for the most part enthralled. A little heavy on the Matrix style fight sequences, with the usual ammunition flying in all directions, it is however, more than a reworked vampire tale of good vs evil, or eveil vs evil (whichever you take) - with a reasonably original storyline in what one has to say, is a highly competetive, and previously visited genre. Without giving too much away, the art direction is gothic but modern and the new Sfx meets old world macabre well, even if there aren't too many suprises along the way. A major plus is the non cliched and well defined beginning middle and end, and the very well handled &quot;human touch&quot; portrayed by the main characters in their fantasy roles. Highly enjoyable romp, with some nice extra's on the DVD, and certainly worth a second look.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Devil Really Does Wear Prada!"></head><body><p>Boy, if you thought that Meryl Streep was a meanie in 2006's The Devil Wears Prada, she took mean to the extreme in 2004's The Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />A bit too far-fetched at times, The Manchurian Candidate still delivers a 2+ hour, twist filled thriller. I am surprised that Director Jonathan Demme didn't keep a better hold on reality with his great track record for doing so in movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Philadelphia under his belt.<br /><br />Credibility gets a bit lost in The Manchurian Candidate by the suggestion that access to a vice presidential candidate would be so easy in order to execute the evil deeds that need to be done by his conspirators. Even more ridiculous is the notion that a vice presidential candidate could escape surveillance in order to commit heinous crimes...let's say for example...a double-murder.<br /><br />Regardless of the sensational conspiracy, the movie is quite entertaining. Good story. Good story-flow. Good actors. Meryl Streep does a terrific Mommy Dearest. Denzel Washington is, as always, on target. And Liev Schreiber plays a zombie well.<br /><br />Definitely a worthy rental.</p></body></html>

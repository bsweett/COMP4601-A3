<meta name="summary" content="Skip It If You Can"></head><body><p>After the excellent &quot;Minority Report&quot;, Spielberg returns with something completely different in &quot;Cath Me If You Can&quot;. Given that I wasn`t expecting much from it, this isn`t a big letdown. Unfortunately, this stylish story about a burglar (Leonardo Di Caprio) and his persecutor (Tom Hanks) isn`t all that appealing and becomes just another popcorn flick with a few nice twists. Sure, the direction and acting are great, the soundtrack cool enough and overall it`s a decent time-capsule picture, however it`s way too long and gets predictable and repetitive. The characters aren`t as deep as they want to be and as a whole the movie lacks substance. Anyway, it still is watchable, there`s a lot worse out there.</p></body></html>

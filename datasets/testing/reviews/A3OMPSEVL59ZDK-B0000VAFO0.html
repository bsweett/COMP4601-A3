<meta name="summary" content="Underworld: It's under something all right."></head><body><p>The Trailer was inspired, the posters were eye candy, the concept was brilliant. The only strike against it's add campaign was the horrific title the movie chose as its monicker. So where did this little-movie-that-could go wrong? Lets investigate shall we.<p>Set Design: No problems from this angle. Besides being a bit cliched everything felt right at home.They were dark set pieces that helped set the mood for the battle of the century. Vampires Vs. Werewolves!! "Only in America".<p>Cinematography: Everything is pretty much soaked in this blue-gray color. It has been done many times before. I wish that just one of these movies would just show some color, it's dark, I get it. <p>Writing: Here, ladies and gentlemen, is the first strike. Many of the lines that these poor thespians must speak are, to say the least, atrocious. It was almost comedic how many cliched lines were just spewed forth. And their was no farce to support these lines, they are spoken with the most serious of tones it becomes almost like a running gag. Unfortunately this is not a comedy and the audience never "gets" the joke. Terrible job. <p>Acting: Strike two! You must care for all of these characters for one reason and for one reason alone: they look really cool in black. Kate runs around emotionless and dull, motivated but strangely lifeless. The rest of this cast just follows the acting 101 lesson of basic emotions. "Grrr I'm angry." "Sniffle I'm sad." They breathe no life into any part of this sad sad production. Not one vampire ever acts like a vampire. Not one werewolf ever acts  like a werewolf. This shoulda been "Humans in black leather Vs. Humans without shirts." Much like the Matrix Reloaded we are merely  teased with the prospect of a true supernatural war of  fantasies most inventive creations.<p>Direction: This movie had a director? Strike three. The plot goes into all the good cliches of having these creatures really interested in science and technology, yet never show some of the good old methods of killing. These scenes try to fill up the spaces between the times of talking and when things go boom. The action scenes never become exciting. While cloning the matrix it never tries to find its own voice, instead it becomes  the echo of the tried and true nature of todays action where wire-fu and guns equal big box office.  Even equilibrium created the "gun-kata" which made it very enjoyable to watch.<p>I have no vendetta against movies that take inspiration from alot of todays most popular films. But when it chooses never to break out  into an original creation is where I find it boring and a complete waste of time to watch. Their is no satisfying aspect to this movie besides the alluring idea of watching vamps and wolves duke it out. Instead we get boring gun fights that could have been just humans fighting it out in the subway.</p></body></html>

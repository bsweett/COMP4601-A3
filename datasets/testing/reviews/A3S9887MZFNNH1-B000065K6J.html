Even that fact ruined it for me, always bloody teenagers getting murdered! The only thing that saves this film is the twists and the fact there is no serial killer just fate/death pure and simple, which works well, but how many more 'Scream, teeny-bop slashers' are they going to make? It gets boring. And as for this film being a make-u-jump kind of film -  what the hell? Ghostbusters made me jump out of my skin more than this overrated movie. One of it's better moments comes when we meet good 'ol Candy man Tony Todd as a  coroner. However with this film, don't expect too much.</p></body></html>

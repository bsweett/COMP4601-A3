<meta name="summary" content="Highly underrated entry of the living dead Saga."></head><body><p>After the events of "Day of the Dead", a community of humans live in a secured city where they are safe from the zombies outside. The ruler of the city who is a wealthy and greedy tycoon named Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) wants to have control of the city to himself with the upper class citizens in nice buildings and poor people on the streets, two renagades named Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizomo) with a team and two friends Slack (Asia Argento) and Charlie (Robert Joy) would sometimes go outside the city for survivors and destroy zombies but unknown to them, the living dead are evolving and might have a plan to get into the city.<br /><br />After years of rumors of a 4th entry in the Living Dead series, George A. Romero finally delivers a spectacular, entertaining and gory as hell entry that might surpise fans of the trilogy. Too bad it didn't too well at the box-office, luckily i saw this at a theater and loved it! it's got new life on DVD and cable even among some fans of Romero's zombie series. Tom Savini does an amusing cameo as the blade biker from "Dawn of the Dead" (1978) and this movie is loaded with gore but more in the unrated cut, it's good bloody fun for zombie fans that i recommend.<br /><br />The Unrated DVD contains more violence then the theatrical cut and good extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, storyboard comparision, music video, and 6 featurettes.</p></body></html>

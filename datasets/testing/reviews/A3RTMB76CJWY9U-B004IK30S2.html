<meta name="summary" content="A Pretty Good Stupid Comedy"></head><body><p>Stupid comedy is an art.<br /><br />Like with any art, sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.... On the top end of the stupid comedy scale, we have films like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the Wedding Singer, Spaceballs and Mystery Men. On the other end of the scale, we have all of the Rob Schneider movies and a few of the Pauly Shore ones. Dodgeball is closer to the bottom, There's Something About Mary is closer to the top.<br /><br />Anchorman is right about in the middle. The humor works... sometimes... like the gangfight scene. That's pretty funny. But sometimes Anchorman falls flat, like the "jazz flute" sequence. The jazz flute bit is kind of lame.<br /><br />People who don't usually like stupid comedy probably won't like Anchorman much at all; the humor relies on Ferrell's mugging and obnoxious overacting. Some of the casting is good, some misses the mark--Steve Carell is comedy gold, and usually Fred Willard is, too, but he looks a bit miscast in his role, here. The cameos are awesome, bringing in Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Ben Stiller and others.<br /><br />Overall, this is an inconsistent film. Some people are going to absolutely love it, others are going to hate it. Me? I was a little disappointed, but it's still an okay movie. It's not Ferrell's best work--he's better in Zoolander, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and the Producers, for instance--but he does a fine job nonetheless. Among stupid comedies, it's of a comfortable, middle quality.</p></body></html>

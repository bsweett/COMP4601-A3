<meta name="summary" content="Bruce can still get the job done and looks good doing it--yippie!!!!!"></head><body><p>Die Hard 4.0 with Bruce Willis's teenage daughter becomes an unwilling bargaining chip to save the world. Her kidnapper is an insane state-of-the-computer-art terrorist. They have the computer codes to bring America to its knees. But you don't mess with the daughter of John McClane you are screwed big time. Non stop action, pissing people off, car chases, train wrecks, 18 wheeler wrecks--what fun on a huge, huge budget that can bring a hollywood movie, and CGI of course, all the way up to an A+. Justin Long, (Jeepers Creepers) plays a computer geek who is John's sidekick throughout the movie.(good job-he is funny) The bad guy --- a psychopath dressed in black with no sense of humour.</p></body></html>

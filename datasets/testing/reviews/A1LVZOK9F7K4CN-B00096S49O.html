<meta name="summary" content="An OK rental..."></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie, but it went on for about a half-hour too long.  All the stuff at the beginning was good: the conceit of Will Smith being a "dating consultant" who has the secrets of letting "any" guy get "any" girl he wants.  What is good about the film are the performances from Will Smith and - surprisingly - Kevin James.  Everyone can relate to that awkward feeling around someone you like, and how good it would be to have an expert coach you through it.  It was also cute how Will Smith, as the expert, looses his cool around the girl he likes.<br /><br />Where the movie falls apart is when it gets into the standard cliches at the end.  Of course, Will Smith will meet an "evil" guy who will misrepresent him, and his girlfriend will get the wrong idea.  Couples will get together, break up, and magically reunite.  This is an OK rental, but I'd be mad if I saw it in theaters.  Not worth owning.</p></body></html>

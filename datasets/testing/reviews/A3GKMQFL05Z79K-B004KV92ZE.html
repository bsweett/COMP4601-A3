<meta name="summary" content="Kung fu Panda......."></head><body><p>Po is a panda who works at his family's noodle shop with dreams of doing kung-fu alongside The Furious Five(a legendary five that is comprised of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Praying Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey (Jackie Chan)). Po is afraid to share his desire with his father who wants him to take over the restaurant when he retires. Everything changes one day when Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) has a premonition about Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his who's gone bad. He fears Tai Lung will escape from prison and come back to the region for revenge. In accordance with prophecy, Oogway stages a ceremony to name a Dragon Warrior to defend the kingdom. He is supposed to pick from among the Furious Five, but error leads to his picking Po. It is left up to Shifu, kung fu master, to teach Po what he needs to defeat Tai Lung but will he be able to in time? That's pretty much what this movie is all about.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, Kung Fu Panda is awesome. It's even more entertaining than any recent CGI movie I've seen on DVD recently. Given, the movie is played a little more seriously with laces of humor throughout, it is definitely a movie the whole family will enjoy.<br /><br />Special Features include: Directors' Commentary, "Meet the Cast" (13:00)- The cast recording the audio for the film,  "Pushing the Boundaries" (7:00) - The computer animation and the creation of the characters,  "Sound Design" (4:00) - The creation of the sound for the film,  Music Video of Cee-Lo singing "Kung Fu Fighting",  "Mr. Ping's Noodle House" (4:00) - The Food Network's Alton Brown goes to Mr. Chow's in L.A. to see how they make noodles,  "How to Use Chopsticks" (3:00) - Instructional video,  "Conservation International: Help Save Wild Pandas" (3:00) - Jack Black talking about the importance of saving pandas, "Dragon Warrior Training Academy" - Game played with the remote.<br /><br />All in all, Kung Fu Panda is a movie that the whole family will enjoy watching over and over again. Definitely recommended.</p></body></html>

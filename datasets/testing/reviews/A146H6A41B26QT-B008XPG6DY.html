<meta name="summary" content="Blackmail with a twist"></head><body><p>"Derailed," a fairly standard adultery/blackmail/thriller sort of film, features some good performances in an otherwise predictable format. Clive Owen as Charles is the well-meaning, over-burdened husband who can't believe his good luck when he meets the lovely Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston) on the train. They barely get their clothes off in a seedy hotel when a crazed blackmailer bursts into the room, beats Owen up, rapes Aniston, and escapes with money, wallets, and the keys to the pair's personal lives. Lucinda begs Charles not to go to the police, and he rather inexplicably complies, putting his family and most importantly his sick daughter, at great risk. Unlike some other viewers, I found it hard to swallow Charles' failure to go to the cops and end the nightmare--why is he putting the wishes of a woman he barely knows above the safety of his family, whom he truly loves? Vincent Cassel as the blackmailer is truly menacing, and gives the best performance of the film.<br /><br />There's a twist about two-thirds of the way through that I didn't see coming and otherwise rescued this rather ho-hum story. There's lots of violence, and the rape scene was way too graphic for my taste; I suppose that would liven it up for some. But I think "Derailed" is a cable TV/rental-only sort of film, especially if you don't want to think too hard, but most definitely not for children or teens.</p></body></html>

The pace of the film was (MUCH) slower than I expected, but couple that with the relentless, bruising heartache it inspires ... well, this work may have been just too painful for me (personally).<br /><br />The acting was spot-on. Murray is playful and tender in his role as Don (Juan) Johnston. Though he has made (and makes) some bad decisions, the viewer is never pitted against him (if we were - if hating him were easy - this film wouldn't be as potent). Likewise, Stone is fantastic in her small but memorable role. In fact, I didn't even notice that she was playing "Laura" until several minutes of her being on-screen. She was just "Laura." Finally, Jeffrey Wright is wonderful as Winston ... Johnston's best (only?) friend. His quirky role is well-written and excellently played.<br /><br />The music is stark. Even much of the soundtrack is diegetic in nature (we hear the music to which Johnston listens). This dramatically contributes to the overall sense of crushing bleakness. It is just so quiet ... contemplative.<br /><br />There are many inside-jokes for lovers of film and literature (which I found entertaining). Lolita's giant heart-earrings (framing her face) were clever (see the poster to Kubrick's adaptation). Likewise, the notion of her wanting to share Popsicles with Johnston is equally amusing. And just when you thought the joke would stop there ... it goes OVER THE TOP (no spoilers from me). But, unlike some, I found this moment neither offensive nor distasteful ... I found it outrageous and hysterical.<br /><br />Still, watching Johnston look for his child in the eyes of every teen-age boy that passes him (the "model," the boy outside the airport, the kid in the car ...) it becomes more than poignant ... it becomes (again) too much. And all the cosmic-collisions and "coincidences" ... it begins to feel like the universe is conspiring against this relatively harmless man (and I mean "relatively" in the grand-scheme ... since the impassioned reaction of two of the women reveals Johnston's guilt).<br /><br />I think that Jarmusch has created a truthful film ... but it may be more truth than I (personally) am prepared for (but this is me ... I felt similarly about Reed's "The Break-Up" ... night and day comparison, I know). But kudos for creating a sensitive, engaging film which breaks from mainstream dreck. I will continue to experiment with this director's work.</p></body></html>

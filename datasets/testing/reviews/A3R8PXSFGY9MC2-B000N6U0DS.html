I tend to feel that after his performance in Ali, he only seems to be getting better. This has some really touching on-screen moments with his son (which are all the more poignant knowing it's Smiths real son) and shows how far a man will go to provide and care for his family. You feel his frustrations as he faces each new setback with strength and determination and you feel yourself rooting for him the whole film. The relationship between Chris snr and his wife are hard to watch as you see their marriage breakdown and unless you've been in that kind of situation I guess you'll never know how hard it can be. This film also has some lighter moments that will raise a smile and I have to say it is a film i enjoyed way more than I expected to and would recommend to anyone out there. Give it a go and judge for yourself.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

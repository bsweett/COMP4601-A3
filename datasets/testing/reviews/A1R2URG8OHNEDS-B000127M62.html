<meta name="summary" content="Yeah...It was Good....."></head><body><p>I saw Jason X.......why?<p>I never saw a Nightmare on Elm Street movie. I never saw ANOTHER Jason movie. But I saw Freddy vs Jason, only because I was interested in finding out who won, and how. When I went, I was expecting to see a scary, interesting movie. After being freaked out by a Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I was ready for the worst. The first time I was truly scared was during a scene in the boiler room where Freddy has one of the main characters cornered, in her dream. The last time I was truly scared was during a scene in the boiler room where Freddy has one of the main characters cornered, in her dream. I was disturbed by a few of the ways that the characters were murdered, but wasn't enough to get me jumping in my seat. <p>I did like the idea. The plot. I only wish the screenwriters and the director tried to take advantage of the good ideas in the movie and made it better. Freddy, looking to kill a man, gets an idea hatched in his evil head. The town where Elm Street is(Freddy's victiums) has locked away survivors that have come in contact with Freddy in the past. They also give them dream retarding drugs, as to destroy any memory that they may have of Freddy, so that he cannot come back to preform movre evil deeds. Freddy's idea is to bring back killer Jason. Jason could kill people on Elm Street, thus making the people around there believe that Freddy has returned to killing. They would bring back the memories that they have tried to forget, allowing him to actually return. In bloodbath sequences, Jason kills a small group of people, and everything after that happens exactly to Freddy's plans. People are dead and he is now strong enough to return. <p>Meanwhile, Lori, Kia, and Gibb are stuck with the memories of Jason killing thier friends. That is untill Lori has a nightmare, where she sees a man named Freddy, the name of the person that the police said as a potentioal killer. Things become more strange when he old boyfriend Will and his friend Mark, return from the psychiatric ward(she doesn't know where he's been) to find out what was going on. <p>When Freddy corners one of them in a dream, up in the real world Jason comes and kills Freddy's future victium. Instead of Freddy killing the person, Jason does. Freddy misses killing and gets angry at Jason. He demands for Jason to return back to the dark shadow world, but Jason says no, leading the two well-known killers, into a battle that goes from the dream world, straight to where Jason was first made...Camp Crystal Lake.<p>But throughout the film I was constantly asking myself, what is with all of this useless stuff, like profanity, the drugs, the sexually situations. Why could we not have a plain horror movies without all the add-ons. A scary movie, like The Ring, with the slasher film quality like scenes in the summer blockbuster 28 Days Later...(another film I had a problem with)<p>Did I hate Freddy vs Jason? The answer to that is no. I enjoyed it very much. After struggling through the first thirty minutes or so, my money was finally paid off with the last hour. When Freddy finally takes command. If the movie had a little more detailed plotline, and some more non bloody action taking place instead of all of the teen partying scenes, etc, this would have robally gained  fourth star. It wouldn't have gained a fifth star because it wasn't excellant. It wouldn't even be great with all the things I mentioned above. My next stop though is to watch the orignal Freddy and Jason films. They have to be better...<p>To watch this movie was not torture. I have no idea what the critics were talking about, saying that it was a terrible dry film. It was good....I liked it. In the word of the 60's generation...mellow out, man. <p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence/gore, gruesome images, sexuality, drug use and language.</p></body></html>

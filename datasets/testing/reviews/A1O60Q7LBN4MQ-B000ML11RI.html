<meta name="summary" content="Violence with a thin plot"></head><body><p>That was a strange yet intriguing film. But I have to agree with my husband, it could have been shorter. It became dull after awhile. Maybe I'm just too old to really appreciate such movies. It just seemed to be a violence filled gore fest. I like a little more plot than a live action comic book film noir.</p></body></html>

I must say that it is a highly entertaining, atmospheric, and intriguing thriller that focuses on ten people, ostensible strangers to each other, who, through a seeming twist of fate, meet one dark and stormy night at a seedy motel in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />There, a strange fate begins to over take them, as one by one they meet up with a mysterious killer. No one knows who amongst them is the killer. No one knows who is next. Yet, there is apparently a link that binds them all. There is also a parallel story involving a convicted killer that opens the film and continues to be interjected at odd moments throughout the film. It is a story that is also interesting and becomes more so as the film continues.<br /><br />There are subtle clues along the way that point the viewer in the right direction, in terms of what is really going on. The viewer, however, will generally realize this in hindsight, which is, of course, always twenty/twenty. The pace of the film is relentless. The tension is palpable. The acting is top notch. The direction is first rate, and the ending screams out, "Gotcha!".<br /><br />This is a surprisingly effective psychological thriller that all those who love films of this genre should enjoy. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep even the most jaded viewers on their toes. While the performances of the entire cast are uniformly excellent, special kudos go to John Cusack for a truly powerful, memorable performance. Bravo!</p></body></html>

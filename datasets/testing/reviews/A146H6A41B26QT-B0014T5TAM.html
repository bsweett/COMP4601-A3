The first half of the film is set in 1935 on a hot summer day on the lush country estate of the Tallis family. Cecilia (Keira Knightly) is the gorgeous, sensual, but bored older daughter of the family. James McEvoy is the housekeeper's son, who works on the estate in the summer but is clearly going places, after a Cambridge education paid for by the mysterious Mr. Tallis, whom we never meet.<br />Cecelia's 13 year old sister, Briony, is an aspiring writer, and is trying to stage her first play that evening for the guests of the house. But there's a lot more going on, as the pounding score by Dario Marianelli suggests. Briony witnesses a mysterious scene by the fountain between Robbie and Cecelia, and we suddenly realize the undercurrents of passion and emotion thick in the hot summer air.<br /><br />Looming in the background are thoughts of the war to come. Through flashbacks and replays from different points of view, the tension builds, and in the space of one boring summer day, the lives of the Tallis family and of Robbie are shattered.<br /><br />For those who haven't read the book it's hard to say more without being a spoiler, so I won't. For lovers of the novel, rest assured that director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton have stayed faithful to the novel, with amazing results. It's hard to think of another instance where the film so perfectly complemented the novel, deepening my understanding and suggesting new interpretations. The war scenes are filmed with all the chaos and horror McEwan writes of, and the final interview with the elderly Briony, played by Vanessa Redgrave, just makes a bit more explicit the shattering climax of the book. With seven Academy Award nominations, including the three biggies, this film is a must see. One of the best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino at his best!"></head><body><p>"Kill Bill Vol. 2" is a movie that will surprise you. As a big fan of 2003's "Vol. 1," I was eager to see the final chapters of the total film. After the film began, I was pretty much in complete shock during the entire viewing. As fast, kenetic, and high energy as "Vol. 1" is, "Vol. 2" slows down the pace enourmously. Tarantino's decision to decelerate the second half of his "Kill Bill" opus was both necessary, and masterful. At the end of "Vol. 1," the audience learns that The Bride's (Uma Thurman) daughter is still alive, while The Bride has believed her to never have been born. This is a clever device which serves two purposes: It gives the audience a terrific cliff-hanger at the end of "Vol. 1," but also sets an appropriate pace for "Vol. 2." Not only do we now that The Bride is on a collision course to finding out the truth about her daughter, but that there's no way she can prepare for said revelation. However, Tarantino brilliantly gets both the audience and The Bride ready for this confrontation through a more dramatic and heart-felt "Vol. 2" of his epic. By slowing the pace and theming of his second film, most of which takes place in the barren desert of the South-West United States as opposed to frenetic Tokyo, Japan of "Vol. 1," Tarantino forces The Bride, relax and take time to realize the path of revenge that she has chosen. In the end, it's an astonishing piece.</p></body></html>

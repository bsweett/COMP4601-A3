The characters themselves are annoying and you actually wish they'll die because who in the hell is dumb enough to chase a tornadoe anyway ? lol. Bill Paxton plays a guy who can sense when a tornadoe is coming and when it's gonna strike when I heard that's not possible. Helen Hunt plays a nutball who's obsessed with chasing a tornadoe because one killed her father when she was little. Paxton and Hunt try hard but their roles are dumb as is the script. Also annoying in supporting roles are Philip Seymour Hoffman "who's a much better actor now and Jamie Gertz (Lost Boys) as Paxton's g/f. The Tornadoe itself is what makes the movie worth watching. The scenes with flying cows, tractors and gasoline trucks help make the movie more fun. The movie would've been better if was about just normal people trying to survive through a tornadoe that's hitting their town.</p></body></html>

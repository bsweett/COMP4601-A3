<meta name="summary" content="A HILARIOUS COEN BROS. FILM DUDE!"></head><body><p>When I first saw this movie I really did not know what to expect or what I was going to see in the next scene and that don't happen to me much. This movie is totally mesmerizing and the characters are absolutely injected with life making the viewer fall in love or hate the characters involved in the plot. This movie is good in the way how 'the dude' tries to just get his carpet back but does as screwed up as his life already is. This movie is a total classic!</p></body></html>

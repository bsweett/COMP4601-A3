And so well done!  Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has lost the ability to form new long-term memories, but that doesn't stop him from going after the man responsible for both his condition and a brutal attack on his wife.  The story unfolds in reverse so that the viewer is able to share Leonard's dilemma; he constantly finds himself in situations that he does not understand with no idea of what preceded.  It is fascinating to see the events leading to scenes that we have already witnessed.  It all culminates in a shattering revelation which Leonard, unfortunately, is doomed to forget...<p>Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss deliver excellent supporting performances.</p></body></html>

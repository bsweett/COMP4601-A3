It is, in most respects, a very good film.  But (and there is that pesky `but') there are elements of this film, key elements at that, that seem off-kilter.  Often referred to as that little Indie that could, `Winter's Bone' has achieved a lot of praise and accolades this Awards season; in fact, it's sitting pretty for some key Oscar nominations, including Actress, Screenplay and Picture.  For me though, this film kind of boils down to one person; Debra Granik.  With a script that can become repetitive and obtuse, to acting that runs the gamut from unapologetically stereotypical to downright sincere and believable (so, in other words, uneven), it all comes together thanks to Granik's marvelous direction.  She understands the chills needed in the atmosphere to get under the audiences skin and create something unforgettable out of a story that is, to put it bluntly, rather forgettable.  `Winter's Bone' has a lot of fans, and I am kind of one of them.  As much as I rag on some of the films generalities, I did enjoy it and certainly would recommend it.  Jennifer Lawrence has some very good moments as the determined Ree, even if I found her handling of some lesser scenes to be awkward and unbelievable.  John Hawkes is the star of the show, for he really creates someone phenomenally centered and conflicted and haunted from start to finish.  It's the dark and spooky climate the makes the movie though, and Granik manipulates it with stellar results.  While it doesn't emotionally connect like it claims to (it is notably cold and distant, but I feel that was intentional and even commendable, to a degree) it does leave an impression thanks to Granik's attention to detail.</p></body></html>

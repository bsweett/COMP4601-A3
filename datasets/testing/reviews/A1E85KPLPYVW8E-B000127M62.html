Jason kind of seemed like an urban legend in the horror movie genere for a long while before it finally decided to become a reality. The movie industry finally realized the potential marketing value of putting the slasher movie genre's most popular and loved villains face to face. It was always a good idea from the start. Yeah, I would say that it was a little outlandish. But outlandish is what made the sequels to Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St. If you didn't expect outlandish by now then you need to watch more Jason and Freddy sequels. Yeah, sometimes it was corny and stupid. I'm use to that when it comes to these two guys. But in the end, the movie was really fun and entertaining. I did think the whole set up to the two fighting was a little slow. And I do think that there could have been 15 to 20 minutes more of Freddy and Jason actually fighting, but this film is loaded with carnage candy and some really cool fight scenes. The film didn't feel like another addition to the lengthy line of sequels that we have had for a while. It felt like a whole 'nother thing happening. This film really is how these two classic killers will be carried on in the 21st century.</p></body></html>

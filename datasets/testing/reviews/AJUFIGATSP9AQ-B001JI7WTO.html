<meta name="summary" content="Best 3-D Image for Home Theatre so far"></head><body><p>I know a little bit about 3-D and 'Journey' is the the best I've seen for current home systems. Using colored lenses that use tints that are more 'opposite on the color wheel; the picture seperates better. Not perfect, but better than most and of course the picture neutralizes; but you got a 3-D movie in the house!<br />The Dolby track needs to be turned up to compensate for the lack of HD track as there are a lot of 3-D sound effects that whooosh, click or boom with the film. The story is perfect for a light adventure; but it is best enjoyed in 3-D. It's like a rollercoaster ride on your couch.</p></body></html>

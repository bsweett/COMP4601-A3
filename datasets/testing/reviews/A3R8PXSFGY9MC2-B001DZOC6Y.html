<meta name="summary" content="The Happening"></head><body><p>`The Happening' is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. I hate to start any review with this kind of sentiment, but there's no getting away from how bad this film is.<br /><br />The original premise seemed pretty promising, I.e. the worlds plants feeling threatened by the encroaching human population, so it releases a neurotoxin that induces people to commit suicide, but the execution of this idea is dire.<br /><br />The writing is simply terrible, with poor story development, lack of full explanation and unnatural dialogue. The acting is terrible, with cringe making wooden performances, Zooey Deschanel is especially bad, when I`ve seen her act so well in the past. The direction is terrible, with inaccuracies (such as someone shooting themselves with a gun and then the camera pans forwards to see the gun metres in front of the person) and annoying full face to camera angles. The plot started off by being intriguing, but the ending is so lack lustre it leaves you feeling severely let down, there isn't even the clich&eacute; M. Night Shyamalan twist ending to even partially redeem this film.<br /><br />What more can I say? I think my glut of the use of the word terrible pretty much sums up my thoughts on this film. Don't waste your time and give this film a seriously wide berth.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

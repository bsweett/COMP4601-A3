The whole thing is a puppetpalooza as the entire film is composed of puppets who are able to do everything that real people do including projectile puking. There's not much of a superficial South Park feel to this film as the plot more closely resembles the old Maxwell Smart vehicle, "The Nude Bomb" than anything offered weekly on Comedy Central.  The Mission Impossible backdrop goes so far as to even have a even a master computer named "I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E." and a Mount Rushmore command center for Team America.<br /><br />Yet, the satire will be quite familiar to those who watch South Park and more amazing than anything one can readily imagine.  The war on terror is a great vehicle for these guys to make fun of just about every one on the planet (humanity can be broken down into the simple framework of a--holes, p-ssies, and dicks here).  There are silly songs and killer lines throughout.  Their send up of the play "Rent" is one early example.  Now it's entitled "Lease" and the theme song is "Everyone has AIDS".  We hear such lines as "come on everybody we've got quilting to do." More jingles like, "America: F--- Yeah!", round out the film and it becomes the Team America theme song.<br /><br />Obviously, any story these guys tell is just a surface mechanism for them to ostentatiously display their unworldly wit which is just fine with me. The gratuitious romantic plotline is present; although, the resultant puppet sex is something beyond description and is more like something from a German scat trailer than anything you'd see from Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Overall, I found Team America/World Police to be masterful. The Screen Actors' Guild is now called the Film Actors Guild which lends itself to the uproarious acronyn of F.A.G.  It is led by the king poseur himself, Alec Baldwin (who, by all rights, should be a Canadain citizen by now).  Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Jeanne Garafalo also figure in heavily.  They are all self-righteously opposed to Team America and become the unwitting dupes of the terrorists and the totalitarian dictator of North Korea...much as they have in real life.  F.A.G. is quite similar to the Hollywood organization, "Not in Our Name."  Parody becomes dangerously close to reality in this film.<br /><br />My favorite part was the skewering of the fat b-stard, Michael "Giant Socialist Weasel" Moore.  He turns into a suicide bomber which is something that many of his ideological opponents would have wished upon him years ago.<br /><br />The portrayal of Kim Jong-il is nearly equal to that of Parker and Stone's 1999 efforts with Saddam Hussein. He's a singing, screaming, plotting dictator right out of Austin Powers.  It's great fun and might be the only punch that the world ever lands upon the North Korean menace.  I'm grateful to the makers of Team America and hope that they create a follow up at least half as politically damaging as this one was.</p></body></html>

I wonder if playing pirate was a boyhood dream, for he gets into it so very well. This sequel is a smooth transition in keeping with the lineal plot of the first film while creating vivid, new characters to spin off on their own. The result is the fresh fringe of fantasy that Disney does so well. I especially love the bizarre sea creatures/sailors that serve the dead Davey Jones, captain of the ghost ship, the 'Flying Dutchman'. Though the end is clearly devised to set us up for another sequel (a trick that makes some viewers go 'Arrgg!'), the tension and absorbing sword fight scenes will satisfy action film seekers, and especially pirate fans, of all ages!<br /><br />Chrissy K.

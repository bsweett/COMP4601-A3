Whole bunch of different kids end up in Saturday detention and learn a lot about each other, themselves, with a lot of laughs, tension and tears. Has some interesting characters, and some pretty intense moments, great opening/closing song too. Hadn't seen it before, but it's gone pretty quickly up to be one of my favorite films.</p></body></html>

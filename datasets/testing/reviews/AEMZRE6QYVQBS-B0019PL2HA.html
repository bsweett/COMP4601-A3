<meta name="summary" content="Don't say those words."></head><body><p>There's only a handful of words you hope never to catch yourself saying without a due period of reflection: 'I love you.' 'That dress makes you look fat.' 'Have you put on a few pounds?' 'Nobody will notice.'<br /><br />And then of course: 'This is the funniest movie I've ever seen.'<br /><br />I can hardly stop myself. I'm gonna' say those words about Will Ferrell's TALLADEGA NIGHTS. THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY.<br /><br />I live in a town that titles itself 'the racing capital of the world'. In fact, I was out at the Brickyard yesterday to watch McLaren continue its resurgence via a Hamilton-Alonso one-two finish in the United States Grand Prix.<br /><br />There are three big races each year at Indy: The 500, Nascar's Allstate 400, and yesterday's F1 race. Each draws a completely different audience, each dismissive of the demographics of the race that came just before theirs and the one that comes after.<br /><br />That's the dynamic upon which Ferrell's Rick Bobby and Sacha Baron Cohen's irrepressible F1 convert to Nascar Jean Girard play. They rightly play to howls of laughter.<br /><br />Ferrell's and John Reilly's Cal Naughton, Jr. (even the name is perfect) hilariously draw out the bisyllables of Southern Fried culture. Even their motto - 'Shake and bake!' - is uproariously Southern.<br /><br />The movie's humor is a bit crude and may push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating of the in-theatre version.<br /><br />But it really doesn't get any funnier than this.<br /><br />I'm gonna say it!<br /><br />The funniest movie I've ever seen ...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark message in classic western flair"></head><body><p>The dark message comes through in this Eastwood creation of classic western genre.  It is a foreboding and frightening tale of a bad man turned good then returning to his past - or is it that his past is coming back to drag him down again?  The cynicism is thick in the theme that there is no one good.  And even the bad are in for more than what they bargained for in this hard-hitting gun-slinging action drama.  If you enjoy the do-good classics, you may not like this film which is a little heavy-handed in its realism concerning the use of violence to settle scores.  Like most cynical statements, it is difficult to swallow and leaves you uneasy whether you enjoy the realism or dislike the taste it leaves behind.  The story is moving and you cannot help but uneasily relate to the main character in all his violent flaws.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Did you ever have a house that you thought someone else was living there with you but you couldn't see them?"></head><body><p>This is an eerie ghost story that will entertain you and scare you.  A young mother is waiting for her husband to return from WW II.  Even though the war is over she has not heard from her husband.  She moves into an old mansion and hires three servants to help her take care of her children and the home.  They have a rare disease that makes them very photosensitive and they can never be in the sunlight or even bright light as it can cause burns and blisters and kill them.<br /><br />Strange events begin to occur in the home and the children claim to see ghosts.  Their mother does not believe them but as time goes along she too is having and seeing strange occurrences.  She is even carrying a shotgun to protect the family from whoever is in the house....<br /><br />This is a multi-twisted plot with a lot of events coming together to make the story especially spine-chilling in the end.  Nicole Kidman does a very good job in this movie in the lead role.  The story has a surprise ending that will shock you.<br /><br />This is a good movie and it is very entertaining.  It is spine chilling at times and that's what good ghost stories are supposed to be like.  I recommend it to you.</p></body></html>

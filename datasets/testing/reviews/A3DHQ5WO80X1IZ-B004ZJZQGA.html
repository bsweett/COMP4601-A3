<meta name="summary" content="One of this year's best!"></head><body><p>One of my favorite movies of the year so far, this is a great little tale of two hitmen who have been exiles to Bruges (a nice little town in Belgium that no one seems to have heard of before, either in the movie or in real life). The ending drags on a little long for me, but for most of the movie the leisurely pace matches the beauty of the town, and there's some terrific acting, especially from Brendan Gleeson.</p></body></html>

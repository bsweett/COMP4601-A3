<meta name="summary" content="Slow and Steady Wins the Race"></head><body><p>Middle-aged businessman finds himself in the middle of a variety of humbling and surprising events, and the superb Dennis Quaid brings life to this character who handles everything that is suddenly thrown at him with a maturity, grace and dignity to be admired. His Dan has lived and learned to roll with the punches and take change in stride as life and its upheavals are like a pendulum. The gravity of his character as well as the stability of his home life and professional humility and loyalty serve him well in the end and guide a very young (and misguided) executive (Topher Grace) into a more human and humane direction. This isn't a BRILLIANT film but it is tasteful and entertaining, showing the generation gap problems faced in today's workplace. The film handles real men at their best and worst and does so skillfully.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tastes Like Good Wine; Bitter-Sweet Tale of Getting Wiser"></head><body><p>Many say 'Sideways' is a funny comedy, and that is not without truths.  But for anyone who knows something about so-called mid-life crisis, this film means much more than being a well-made comedy.  In short, 'Sideways' is a bitter-sweet tale about the life -- life with regrets and a little bit of hope -- and as that it is fantastic.<br /><br />Nothing remarkable happens in 'Sideways.'  One English teacher (and recently divorced) Miles (Paul Giamatti) travels with his friend Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) around California tasting good Californian wine, playing golf, and having a double date with two women Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh).  Jack was a popular TV star (and an occasional TV commercian narrator) who is getting married in a week, and for him this is the last chance to be really 'free.'  In the menawhile, Miles has his own concern because he wants to be a writer though none of the publishers he submitted his manuscript wouldn't accept it, not even give a call to him.  And Miles vaguely senses that success is eluding him.<br /><br />Nothing more attractive than the written story, but these characters and their emotions are so real, so amusing and often so painful that the film becomes a tour to get to know these people, whose virtues and even flaws start to look very adorable.  Jack is a hopeless case of womamizer, but we understand his personality, if not tolerate.  Miles ia haunted by the perpetual self-loathing habit, and we know it when he calls his ex-wife, asking if there could be a second chance.  Of course, there is not, we know it, and he knows it.  But he had to phone, and ask, and hates himself for doing that.<br /><br />Though wine plays the integral part of the film, it does so not with some knowledge about vintages, but with a slyly concealed allegory about life.  I cannot reveal the part in detail, but at one scene, which virtually brought an Oscar nomination to Virginia Madsen, Miles and Maya talk about something in the candle-lit room.  Apprantly Miles talks about wine.  But we soon know Maya's answer to him means much deeper Miles initially suspected.  Don't miss this part, for this is one of the most touching moments in the movie history.  Surely Ms. Madsen deserves an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />As every good comedy is ultimately talking about life, 'Sideways' is also about life.  A life that you think could be different, which could be still OK.  This film is such a precious experience to teach us that.</p></body></html>

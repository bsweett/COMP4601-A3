In "Love Actually," he lets his writing and directing talents run wild as he gives us seemingly dozens of interlapping tales of romance -- mainly comic, some farcical, others poignant -- all based in London in the five weeks before Christmas.<br /><br />Where does one start with a movie that stars (and gives quality time to) such luminaries as Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, and has inspired cameos by Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President, and numerous American beauties such as Shannen Elizabeth and Denise Ricahrds?  I'd probably start with the guy who nearly steals the show, Bill Nighy.  In the movie's most original subplot, Nighy plays Billy Mack, an aging pop star reduced to rewriting one of his hits ("Love is All Around," from the "4 Weddings" soundtrack, naturally) in a shameless bit of exploitation as "Christmas is All Around."  Mack knows he's doing this just for a buck, and he tells everyone (including the listening public, to the horror of his long-suffering manager) what horrible dreck the song is.  But it's his chance to become popular again, and that's what a pop star needs.  Nighy personifies the aging rocker to the hilt in a movie-defining performance.<br /><br />The Billy Mack sub-plot kind of stands to one side in this movie, as its only connection to the rest of the stories comes through the other characters listening to Mack's "hit" on the radio or watching the video, a horribly sexist monstrosity directly descended from Robert Plant's "Addicted to Love" video.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is more or less inter-related, whether by employment, marriage, or birth.  Take your pick for charming subplots.  Colin Firth discovers his wife's affair with his own brother, and he falls for his Portuguese housekeeper -- leading to a romance that overcomes a hilarious language barrier.  Liam Neeson's wife has just died, and his adorable 11-year old stepson is tormented both by the loss of his mother and the fact that he is in love with the most popular girl in school.  The solution - become a talented musician, and the girls will fall for you (just like Billy Mack!).  Or there's Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister, who becomes a national hero after publicly chastising the U.S. President (Thornton, so very creepy) for lording its superpower status over its friends.  Sure, he's a national hero, but he's also got a crush on his catering manager, and he's not sure if he can ask her for a date.<br /><br />And so on, and so forth.  One could go on describing sub-plots (and there are many other worthy stories here), but it would take longer than it does to watch the movie.<br /><br />Curtis' greatest achievement is the magnificent interweaving of these various tales.  Each has a slightly different emotional heft to it -- there's the melancholy tale of Alan Rickman's tepid experimentation with an affair at the expense of his wife, Emma Thompson, but there's also the absurdist adventure of Connor, self-proclaimed "sex god on the wrong continent," who goes to America to meet girls, and in Milwaukie, Wisconsin, he hits the mother lode.  But the stories flow together naturally, and that's no small trick.<br /><br />This is an ultimately silly-yet-heartfelt movie that contains a several laughs and outright guffaws, and you will also probably find yourself tearing up during a few scenes, as well.  But be warned -- this is definitely an R-rated movie, both on the language front as well as with the "skin."  Some movies are rated 'R', and you're not really sure why - but this one's clear.  I'm not criticizing, but you may want to think twice before watching this movie with prudish friends and family.<br /><br />Check it out.</p></body></html>

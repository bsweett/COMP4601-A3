<meta name="summary" content="A Real Horror"></head><body><p>"Van Helsing" (2004) should have been an enjoyable homage to the classic Universal horror films of the 1930s. Unfortunately, the finished product is an overblown, effects-laden disaster. Not even Hugh Jackman can redeem this sordid enterprise. It's enough to make Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan (the ORIGINAL Professor Van Helsing) spin in their graves.</p></body></html>

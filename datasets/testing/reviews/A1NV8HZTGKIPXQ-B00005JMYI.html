And what exactly do they say to each other when they break for commercial and we can't hear what they say?. Or when it's over and the credits roll?. Well, we find out here, and it's one of a number of deliriously silly and funny moments that fill up this goofy, but funny satire. Will Ferrell, who can do no wrong by this reviewer, continues his streak of making funny, enjoyable little pieces of comedy fluff. This is probably his most inspired creation so far. The film is narrated by Bill Kurtis, an A&E staple who hosts such shows as "Cold Case Files", and "American Justice". Will plays Ron Burgundy, a local 1970's anchorman in San Diego(or San Diago as he has called it), who seems to be riding high on all fronts. He is an insanely childish and pompous, and the lights are pretty dim in that well coiffed melon of his. He's treated like an important celebrity(or at least he think he is)and he is living the high life. Along with his buddies. Champ Kind(David Koechner), is the cowboy hat wearing sports guy, and has an unhealthy interest in Ron. Roving reporter Brian Fontana(Paul Rudd), is the big mustached ladies man. And then there is weatherman Brick Tamland(the hilarious Steve Carrel), a simpleton who has been declared "mentally retarded". The guys' male dominated lifestyle and world is shaken up when the station hires Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate), a hot young lady who aspires to be a top anchor herself, and throwing a wrench in what the men, and life at that time in general, thought of as an "only men" kind of thing. A time when women didn't have the power they have now. When they were assistants or secreteries, and were seldom seen, and heard even less. As the movie shows it as being. Once she arrives, the comedy really kicks in, especially when the two result to petty pranks and name calling to make it to the top. The always great Fred Willard co-stars as the station's boss. There is no great plot or meaning here, except for Will and the gang to have fun with their characters and make a silly little comedy that is only meant for pure fun and entertainment. They succeeded. It is no surprise that Applegate is funny and holds her own. She practically comes from an entire life of comedy, and her ditzy work as Kelly Bundy on "Married With Children" was an inspired bit of comedy buffoonery acting, and was not appreciated in the right way. She has come a long way from that role with tons of other parts since then. Ferrell is the kind of comedian who will just jump right in there and do it. No matter what. Burgundy can get a bit tiring after a while, but he is always ready to pull you back in with a funny line or scene. Carrel, as Brick, gets the most laughs here. There is a great scene where our reporters are confronted by the other channel's news teams in a hilarious "battle" scene. The moment is only made better because of the cameo appearances from stars who plays the other top anchors. I won't say who. That will spoil the fun. The design of the film works real well and has that 70's look and vibe, and the outfits and facial hair are hysterical. As is the use of The Starlight Vocal Band's hit, "Afternoon Delight". The DVD claims it is the unrated, unedited version, but I never saw the original theatrical release, so I couldn't tell you what is newly put in and what is there. The special features are a delight. There are bloopers, which can also be found during the end credits, and outtakes, and lots more. Plus a hilarious video of the already mentioned song above. Bill Kurtis himself appears in a feature that has him having a 10 minute talk with Ron Burgundy. All in all, it's a riotously silly and cheeseball comedy that will leave you with nothing more than a smile on your face and the knowing that you saw a completely mindless film that only wanted to have fun for an hour and a half. And what fun it is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Great Movie!"></head><body><p>A truly great "cops and robbers" movie has to have a strong plot, plenty of suspense, tough guys on both sides, a love interest, good directing, sharp dialogue, and enough twists and turns to keep us off-balance.  We don't always have to understand every step but we have to be able to put it together in the end.  Icing on the cake is when the acting is top-notch as well.  There have been a number of such movies over the years and I was very happy to see in "LA Confidential" the evidence that Hollywood can still make them.<br /><br />The term "Film Noir" is somewhat overused these days but it applies to "LA Confidential".  What makes it all the more interesting is how the film noir motif is coupled with modern-day perspectives on such things as race, vice, and ambition.  This movie would have been a good 30 minutes shorter if made in the 1950's but it is a better film for its' extended analysis of its' surroundings.  The mystery becomes more personal as we get a better understanding of the characters.  That, too, is aided by the quality of acting.  For me, the top kudos go to Kevin Spacey (who hasn't always impressed me in other movies) and Kim Bassinger.  Newcomer Guy Pearce was probably a bit mis-cast and James Cromwell may have had too much trouble trying to shake off his character in "Babe".  Russell Crowe gives one of his better preformances and is more audible than he is in later movies.  The ubiquitous Danny DeVito got to be a bit much at times but we were supposed to dislike him anyway.  Altogether they keep us rivited to the action on film all the way to the very end.  In the process we get comments on racial injustice, police corruption, immorality in high places, yellow journalism, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />This is a movie I enjoy seeing again.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Country that gave us Truffault gives us blood spattering effect, too"></head><body><p>I bought this one cheaply and it looked like enjoyable fare--a foreign slasher flick set in a familiar place (middle of nowhere).  It also has a bunch of extras, and numerous sound and subtitle options so you can watch it as you please (all subtitled with French spoken on the soundtrack or the half-half approach of the theatrical version, etc).  Oh, and it's the unrated (re: more gore) version.<br /><br />Two university friends in France head out to the remote farm house of one of their parents to get some peace and quiet to study.  That night, a hulking, crazed handyman killer shows up and butchers most of the family.  We have one of the most ridiculous killings I've ever seen, a guy gets decapitated by a dresser--the killer just moves it across the floor and...knocks his head off!  Right, I don't get it, but hey, there's a totally grisly effect because, you know, this is a 'horror' movie.  In case you weren't aware, a severed head causes a lot of fake blood to spurt all over the floor, etc, etc.<br /><br />Er, anyway, the daughter is bound and taken in the killer's van, which looks like some kind of evil ice cream truck, and our 'heroine' hops aboard in an attempt to save her.  There's a failed escape, an axe, a car chase, some stalking, more stalking, barbed-wire beatings, a tremendous buzz-saw thingee that yes, causes a lot of blood to just spraaaaaaaaaay all over the audience, etc, etc.<br /><br />But...unfortunately, our Franco filmmakers can't leave well enough alone.  Look, I like slasher movies, I can deal with the usual, the demented male killer chopping people up, I know where it's coming from and going.  But something happened here...they had to be cute and include a 'twist'.  And not a good twist, either.  No, this is a baloney twist, a makes-no-sense twist.  According to this twist, every bit of logic is thrown out the window.  Seriously, the twist just doesn't make any sense--it's on the 'it was only a dream level' of 'twists' (ie LAME) but it's not 'only a dream', so I didn't spoil it for you.  In one of the extras, the filmmakers start discussing it and 'the clues' (which in hindsight are pretty lame) but it's not even worth trying to dissect it.  It's just a cheap story device.<br /><br />So for most of the flick, we have an old fashioned insane madman on the loose killing people.  Fair enough.  We have some impressive gore, done by the dude who used to spray the red stuff for Lucio Fulci, and we see some of those old stylistic touches (the gruesome murder in front of the slatted-door closet is one, the relentless spray in the car with that crazy buzz-saw is another, the overall love of gore, period).  There is some good high tension, actually, including the killer stomping around the farm house, looking for victims.  There's also some of the stupidest slasher-movie behavior I've seen in a long time, I mean, very stupid.  There's a high demented factor, of course, and the filmmakers were even nice enough to make sure that a little kid gets it, too.  So tasteful are the French and their American slasher counterparts.<br /><br />Overall, most of the ride is decent.  But the twist really negates so much of the film and makes you feel like, well, an idiot, even though it's the filmmakers who should feel idiotic since the whacky surprise ending is completely unnecessary.  (Even worse, the twist assumes a level of character development that the film simply does not bother with, so again, why?)<br /><br />Looks good, sounds good, multiple options for listening, a bunch of extras, blah blah blah.</p></body></html>

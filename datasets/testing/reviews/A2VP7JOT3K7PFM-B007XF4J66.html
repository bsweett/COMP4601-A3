<meta name="summary" content="Have you ever been in a cafe like this one??"></head><body><p>+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on a play entitled "Everybody Comes to Rick's."<br /><br />This movie starts with the following narration:<br /><br />"With the coming of the second world war many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully or desperately toward the freedom of the Americas.  Lisbon became the great embarkation point.  But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.  And so a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.  Paris to Marseilles, across the Mediterranean to Oran.  Then by train or auto or foot across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco.  Here the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.  And from Lisbon to the New World.  But the others wait in Casablanca: and wait and wait and wait..."<br /><br />The story that can be described as a "romantic thriller" begins from here and takes place about a year after the Germans invaded France.  Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) wander into Rick's caf&eacute; in Casablanca.  The two are on the run from the Nazis and have come to Rick's to obtain exit visas or letters of transit.  But the German-controlled local government, headed by a "poor, corrupt official" Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) is on the move, and Laszlo has to act quickly to get the exit visas he came for, then escape.  Ilsa doesn't know that the "saloon-keeper" who runs the cafe is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), the one true love of her life whose heart she broke.  When the two meet again sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back.  So when Ilsa offers herself in exchange for Laszlo's safe transport out of the country, the bitter Rick must decide what's more important: his own happiness or the lives that hang in the balance.<br /><br />This movie is famous, among other things, for the song "As Time Goes By" played by Rick's piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) and first encountered by the lovers Ilsa and Rick.  Ilsa when she enters Rick's caf&eacute; asks Sam the following:<br /><br />"Play it once, Sam...Play it Sam.  Play `As Time Goes By'...Sing it Sam.  (The line "Play it again, Sam" never appears in the movie.)  Here are some of the lyrics:<br /><br />"You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply, as time goes by.  And when two lovers woo, they still say I love you, on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings, as time goes by."<br /><br />The dialogue uttered by all the actors, especially by Humphrey Bogart is unforgettable.  Here are four of my favorite Bogey lines:<br /><br />(1) "Here's looking at you, kid."<br /><br />(2) "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."<br /><br />(3) "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."<br /><br />(4) Rick is asked by an official what his nationality is.  Rick's reply: "I'm a drunkard."<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal especially by Bogart and Bergman.  Special mention should also go to Clause Rains as the Captain.<br /><br />The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD (the one by Warner Studios, released in June 2005) is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has three extras: (1) a documentary hosted by Bogart's widow Lauren Bacall (35 min) (2) original theatrical trailer (3) other theatrical trailers of famous Bogart movies.  I found all these extras interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie has it all: good background music, great dialogue, an interesting story, good acting, and interesting cinematography.  Be sure to see it and discover why it was voted by the American Film Institute the second best movie of all time and why it won three Academy Awards (including Best Picture)!!!<br /><br />(1942;  105 min;  black and white;  36 scenes;  full screen)<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

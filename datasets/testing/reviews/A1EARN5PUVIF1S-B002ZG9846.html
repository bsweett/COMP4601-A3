<meta name="summary" content="What a Kick"></head><body><p>This film was certainly a pleasant surprise: a smart, funny superhero movie. What a concept!<br /><br />Really, the sharp script sets the tone here, but the acting and direction carry it along as well.<br /><br />Some of the digital effects look a little cheesy, but the headlong pace hustles the viewer past them in a blink.<br /><br />Otherwise the fight scenes are first rate, and little Hit Girl makes Go Go in "Kill Bill" look like a piker!<br /><br />A great villain, likable hero, and interesting secondary characters all make an impression as well.<br /><br />I have deducted a star only because this DVD has NO extras -- no commentary, making of, casting discussion, nada.<br /><br />This film deserves much better, and with any luck a tenth-anniversary edition will make amends.  I'm sorry I'll have to wait ten years to add this to my collection!</p></body></html>

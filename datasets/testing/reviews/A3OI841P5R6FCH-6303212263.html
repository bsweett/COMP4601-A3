Well, it's not just because of the extra features included in the Special Edition presentations. In the case of SUPERMAN The Movie, I decided to make a direct comparison between the DVD and the regular cut VHS edition. I got the disc, rented the tape, and then played both simultaneously on my TV, trying my best to keep them synchronous. I constantly switched back and forth between the VHS and DVD to see exactly which scenes were restored to the Special Edition. Yes, folks, this is my idea of a good time. Sad, isn't it?<br /><br />But, thanks to my little side-by-side comparison, I was blown away by the amazing differences between the picture & sound qualities of the two formats of the first flick I ever saw in a theater. I was able to hear all of those subtle little background noises that are harder- if not impossible- to perceive on VHS. The tinkling of broken glass and the upheaval of Krypton's crust following the movies' opening credits is a wonderful example of the DVD's excellent sound variety & clarity. Of course, it also helps when the folks who released the DVD edition decided to enhance the sound as well!<br /><br />Another great benefit of the superior audio is a better-sounding musical score. The opening titles theme is by far my all-time favorite piece of John Williams-composed movie music. No previous or subsequent Superman movie or TV show soundtrack score has even come close to capturing the essence of the character like Williams did for this movie. Ofttimes I'll watch the opening credits sequence several times in a row just so I can listen! There's even a music-only track where you can just kick back and play the DVD pretty much like it was a soundtrack CD!<br /><br />The picture quality, aside from having a bit of a solarized glow during dissolves, was way sharper that its VHS counterpart. It was so sharp, in fact, I could see the matte borders around Kal-El's geode-cradle space ship-thingy as it flew through the psychedelic cosmos, as well as other limitations of the special effects of that era that were somewhat hidden in the muddier magnetic media. Hmm... perhaps having superior picture clarity isn't all it's cracked up to be, eh? Still, it's kinda cool to look back at the FX of the times and see how far things have advanced since then. Even director Richard Donner gets a bit nostalgic about the "good ol' days" of special effects on the commentary track. He also points out a few less-than-magic moments that he and co-commentator Tom Mankiewitz (sp?) get a bit of a laugh out of.<br /><br />Then there are the new scenes, many of which passed by without me noticing much o a difference. It's likely due to the fact that I kinda remember them, since many of these bits were restored to the network TV broadcasts of the movie back in the 80s. One weird extra smidge of footage was the Kryptonian Council sending an enforcer to stop Jor-El from launching his sons' ship. Strangely enough, this little moment was never followed up; the enforcer was never seen again, save a brief appearance at the beginning of SUPERMAN II. Another cool addition is Superman running through Luthor's gauntlet of bullets, flames, and frost on his way to the criminal genius's lair (in the commentary track, Donner and Mankiewitz discussed the debate they had about whether or not they should have left the gauntlet scene in the theatrical release; they considered it too much of a "the-audience-already-knows-about-Supes'-invulnerability-so-why-repeat-ourselves?" thing, and ultimately dropped it). My favorite new moment, however, was an extension of the scene where young Clark Kent outruns the express train running through Smallville. This addition is one of those strange co-inky-dink-twist-of-fate-type moments that classic superhero books seem to have in spades. There's even a couple deleted scenes that weren't reincorporated into the movie involving Miss Teschmacher and Luthors' "babies". Fortunately, no footage was shot that made references to Ned Beatty's (Otis) performance in 'Deliverance.' Speakin' of Otis: the interplay between Hackman and Beatty's characters added a great touch of lighthearted humor to counterbalance Luthor's scary scheme to... well, let's just say it involves Luthor's obsession with real estate.<br /><br />Included in the bonus features section (aside from the stuff I've already brought up) is a three-part "making of" documentary hosted by Marc "Jimmy Olsen" McClure, a teaser trailer, and a couple screen tests featuring a laughably skinny Christopher Reeve in the Big Blue togs before he got himself beefed up for the flick (in the commentary track, Donner mentions that Reeve's personal trainer was David Prowse, better known as the guy inside the Darth Vader suit) . While I've been a bit jaded by DVD bonus features and extras lately, a few of them were almost as entertaining as the movie itself! The part where Richard Donner was confident that Reeve would walk again was kinda sad, however...<br /><br />Before I wind this review up, I'll leave you with a totally useless and time-wasting activity for you to perform while watching this film. There's a not-so-magic moment where you can see director Richard Donner's reflection on a pane of glass! He also has an intentional cameo later on in the movie. His brief performance isn't exactly Hitchcockian or Tarantino-esque, but I think he makes out okay. Oh, and no fair listening to the commentary track (he points out both moments) while you're looking! Happy hunting!<br /><br />`Late<br /><br />UPDATE 7/20/2006: Ya might wanna hold off on buying this particular edition `til `round Thanksgiving 2006. I've a sneaking suspicion that Warner will be rereleasing this movie as well as all the other ones in super-mega-tricked-out special editions to coincide with the DVD release of "Superman Returns." Hey, they did the same thing with the "Batman" movies when they put "Batman Begins" on DVD; I wouldn't put it past the Warner guys to do it with the Supes flicks, as well...<br /><br />`Later</p></body></html>

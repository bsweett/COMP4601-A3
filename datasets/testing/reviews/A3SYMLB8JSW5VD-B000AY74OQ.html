However Alex and the rest of Marty's friends enjoy the life of luxury at the zoo. Marty decides to venture outside the zoo. And his friends go after him. Subsequently get caught and is sent away. After that it's gets really interesting. I enjoyed the Lemurs. But my only disappointment is that David Schwinner and Jada Pinkett  characters was minuscle at best. The penguins were more annoying that cute and cuddly.</p></body></html>

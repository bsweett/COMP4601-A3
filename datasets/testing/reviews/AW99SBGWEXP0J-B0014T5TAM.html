<meta name="summary" content="Atonement"></head><body><p>In 1935 England, 13-year old Briony (Ronan) lives with her family in the countryside.  Her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) is developing a relationship with Robbie (McAvoy) the servant.  Cecelia herself has a crush on Robbie and is a bit jealous.  She does see him as a seducer and wants to protect Cecelia.  When a friend of the family is raped on the grounds, Briony offers up a lie that will change the three of their lives forever.<br /><br />"Atonement" is an interesting, if tragic, movie.  It straddles a thin line between youthful misunderstanding and jealous maliciousness.  Briony is a tragic figure, played well by Ronan, Garai, and Redgrave, who spends her life trying to make up for a wrong that may or may not have been intentional.  McAvoy is solid as Robbie, the person whose life is most directly affected by her actions.  Director Joe Wright does a good job bringing war torn Europe to life.  The problem with "Atonement" is that, aside from having a main character in Briony that is mostly unlikable, the film is a bit of a downer.  This will not be a hit with mainstream audiences, and really was the weakest of the Best Picture nominees in 2007.  This is definitely not a film for everyone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A sad and moody movie that ends up being the wrong story"></head><body><p>"The Forgotten" is a strange movie to review.  I really like the performances in the movie and most of the scenes are very effective (although there is much more running and car chasing than a psychological drama really needs).  However, the premise of the movie completely undermines the actual story presented on the screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't really talk about the plot twists because I don't want to give anything away.  However, let me say this.  Given what is finally revealed in the movie, if that is the real universe this movie inhabits, the story as presented is actually meaningless.  Yes, Telly Paretta's (poignantly played by Julianne Moore) story is sad and we feel for her.  However, there were several characters in this story, given the final state of things, whose story would have been much more interesting and central.  This story is like focusing on a farmer whose pig goes missing in Stalingrad in December 1942 and treating the Nazi invasion as incidental because the farmer gets his favorite pig back.  I mean, aren't there bigger issues here?<br /><br />Anyway, the disk provides an "extended version with alternate ending".  There really isn't much extended here, but the alternate ending is better, but still is not enough to really save the movie.<br /><br />So, ok if you like Julianne Moore and if you like sad, moody tales.  However, if you leave your brain turned on please remove any hard throwable objects from your immediate viewing area or you could end up losing your television.</p></body></html>

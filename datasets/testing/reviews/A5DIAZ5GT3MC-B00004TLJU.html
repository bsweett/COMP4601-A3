More than just the average spaghetti western, this cinematic mastepiece has been regarded by everyone from Quentin Tarantino to Robert Rodriguez as one of the greatest films ever made. With this new double-disc special edition, this film has been fully restored in an extended three-hour version that features over eighteen minutes of new scenes that have been dubbed in English for the first time for this release. <p>Our three title characters are all after one thing: a large helping of Confederate gold hidden in an unmarked grave. They all go back and forth in forging false alliances with one another in an attempt to get what they need. Wallach knows the name of the graveyard where it's hidden and Eastwood has the name of the grave while Van Cleef is ready to kill at will to find the treasure. This all makes for an intruiging adventure as the three travel on their own respective paths through the burning desert, the war-ravaged towns, and the vast mountains. The only common ground they share is their journey for the prize and their willingness to shoot and kill anyone including each other who stands in their way. <p>This DVD edition of &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; is about as good as it gets for longtime fans of the movie. While some might be able to notice the difference between the newly-dubbed scenes and the original U.S. version, it's well worth it to finally see the movie the way Sergio Leone wanted it to be viewed. In additioned to finally getting the fully-restored extended cut of the film, there is another disc of added bonus features. There is a featurette explaining all of the hard work that MGM had put into reconstructing the new version of the film. There is also a featurre and accompaning commentary on the spectactular Moricone score. There are two &quot;deleted scenes&quot;, a longer and more violent cut of Van Cleef's brutal interrogation of Wallach, and a detailed video outline of the incomplete Socorro sequence. You're also getting three documentaries, one on the making of the film, one about Sergio's film style, and another one titled &quot;The Man Who Lost The Civil War&quot;, which has nothing to do with the film itself but is more of a historical reminder of where the movie came from.  <p>Having grown up in the 80's, I was never a huge fan of Westerns and in fact, I had never seen this film prior to purchasing it but after seeing it, it joins the ranks of such films as &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot; in becoming an instant favorite after just one viewing. It has clearly influenced so many of the films that followed it with its groundbreaking visual style. Eastwood's quiet but cool stranger was obviously used as the blueprint for many action heroes that followed. Even if you've never seen or heard of this movie, you will recognize Ennino Moricone's infamous musical score. If you are the type who has never cared enough to pick up a Western film, I encourage you to drop all preconceived notions about the genre and pick up this DVD. &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; isn't just some cliche-driven cowboys and robbers movie, it is a stylish and well-photographed action adventure. I think a lot of you will be pleasantly surprised in what you find.</p></body></html>

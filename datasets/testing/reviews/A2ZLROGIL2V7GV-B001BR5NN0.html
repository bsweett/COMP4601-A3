That's what happens to five high school students who are forced to spend a Saturday detention together.  None of them have anything in common and none of them are friends.  Each is an opposite from the other.  The group consists of a brain, a prom queen, a jock, a basket case and a trouble-maker.  A unique and unexpected bond is formed by the five teens as the day goes on, with all sorts of different states of emotion going on for each of them.  No matter happens on Monday, all five of them will always that one Saturday together; therefore, forever labeling them &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot;<p>Not only is this a classic film, it's one of my personal favorites.  I loved it when I was little and I love it now as I am in my twenties.  It's so refreshing to have a brutally honest film that plays on all of your emotions as this movie does.  And even though this was shot in the eighties, people can still relate to it now in 2000.  This is why it is so effective and powerful.<p>The movie is so memorable that you will most likely repeat every single line during each viewing.  The actors do a terrific job of portraying their roles flawlessly.  The script is funny and touching at the same time.  Everything that is shown in the movie is crucial and significant; being that there isn't a single minute in the movie that goes wasted.<p>This new DVD edition, while it may not be the most spectacular of DVDs, is a lot better than the previous version.  They did an excellent job of producing a successful remastered version of the movie that looks and sounds excellent.  You can even watch it in DTS; that is, if your system carries it.  I'm afraid there's not much to offer in the special features department.  It really is a shame, being that this is such a classic movie.  Still, the way the film looks and sounds is worth the price alone.<p>&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a terrific movie that still has the same effect on us as it did years and years ago.  It's funny, tragic, touching and honest.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, please, make sure that the next time you are at a video store that you pick this up and check it out.  You have no idea what you're missing if you don't.  Still a favorite after so many years, this film surpasses so many movies that we see today.  An excellent achievement on all fronts.</p></body></html>

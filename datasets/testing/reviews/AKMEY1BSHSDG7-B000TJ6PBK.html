<meta name="summary" content="What horror films are supposed to be."></head><body><p>If you are in the market for slash, gore and stupid dialogue, pass up 1408. This film ranks as one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The story is well-constructed and John Cusack's performance is outstanding.<br /><br />Guaranteed that you will find yourself pondering the meaning of this film's content for some time to come. Very highly recommended!</p></body></html>

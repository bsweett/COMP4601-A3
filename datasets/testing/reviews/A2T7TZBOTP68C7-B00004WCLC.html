<meta name="summary" content=""Magnolia" Blooms"></head><body><p>This odd and touching movie by Paul Thomas Anderson is a treat for anyone who is willing to give up three hours and apply themselves (yes, that is the word) to this at times disjointed, disturbing, and ultimately enlightening film.<br /><br />Acted by a score of extremely talented actors, some known and some not so well known, the movie is a series of scenes from the lives of several people.  They are all supposed to be connected by fate in some way, which is supposed to be revealed by the end.  A narration at the beginning of the film talks about strange coincidences and connections, alleging they are facts.  Let it be known that they are NOT facts, especially the most promoted one, the one about "the jumper" who was fatally shot as he fell past a window by his own mother aiming a gun at his father is pure fiction.<br /><br />There is dying, wealthy, elderly Earl Partridge (Jason Robards)and his young, beautiful wife (Julianne Moore).  Linda is clearly on the edge as she goes to hunt for liquid morphine for her husband.  Sensitive and caring nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wants to grant his client's wish to see his estranged son, perverted toadboy extraordinaire Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), who has an empire in "self-help" for men to learn to "Seduce and Destroy" all the p***y they want.<br /><br />Then there is Irish cop Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly, looking for love as he whistles along his merry beat.  His annoying chatter belies a sincere and kind heart, and he meets Claudia Gator (Melora Walters) on a noise disturbance call to her apartment.  He asks her on a date as she is snorting cocaine behind his back.  Claudia's father is famous game show host Jimmy Gator.  Jimmy is dying, but his daughter refuses to see or speak to him.  Jimmy is hosting a show called "What Do Kids Know?" and boy genius Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is going to make or break his father's fortune on the show.<br /><br />Former 1960's quiz show kid genius Donnie (William H. Macy) is having a nervous breakdown as he is fired from his job at Solomon Solomon (Alfred Molina) furniture store.  In fact, most of these characters have a nervous breakdown of some kind.  The story is riveting.  There are many more amazing and enjoyable characters, literally too many to mention here, although I would like to.<br /><br />At some point in Magnolia, you will quietly break down and cry.  It is a different point for each viewer.  It is just that kind of movie, the kind that can be a cathartic experience.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes about Magnolia.  One of the best acted and most gripping scenes at the beginning is never followed up on!  And toward the end of the film, a surreal, post-modernist event unrelated to anything in the film, unexplainable and unexplained, distracted from the brilliant scenes before. I feel this was personal on the part of P.T. Anderson, who wrote, directed, and co-produced Magnolia.  It lent NOTHING to the film.</p></body></html>

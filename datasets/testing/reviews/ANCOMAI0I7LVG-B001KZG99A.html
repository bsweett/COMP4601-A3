My wife and I were talking recently about how the whole concept behind superhero movies has really shifted focus in recent years.  The major studios have realized that more than just teenage boys go to see these movies; and while there are still critical clunkers and high octane action popcorn munching fluff films thrown into the mix; there are also a slew of very intelligent and dramatic superhero films to come out recently.  While `Iron Man' may lack the moral dilemmas that made `The Dark Knight' one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, it definitely earns a spot next to `Spider-Man 2' as one of the most exciting and most watchable superhero movies in recent memory.<br /><br />We can all get on our knees and thank Robert Downey Jr. for that.<br /><br />From the opening scene, where Tony Stark is conversing rather charismatically with soldiers while crossing the desert, Downey Jr. embodied his character with so much natural charm that we were sucked in.  He was funny, he was touching, he was bold, he was confident, he was vulnerable, he was angry; he was all of these things throughout the course of this film, and each emotion was portrayed effortlessly.  He understood each avenue of his characters development and he worked very hard to create a man out of Iron Man.<br /><br />The film starts with a savage attack that leaves Stark in the hands of terrorists that want him to build for them his newly designed superweapon.  Instead, he builds himself a supersuit that enables him to escape with his life.  After witnessing the atrocities that his company has helped create (he builds weapons for war) he decides that he doesn't want his legacy to be mere death but he wants to do something meaningful with his life.  That's when Iron Man is born.<br /><br />The film, much like `Batman Begins' and the first `Spider-Man' film, focuses mostly on Stark's transformation from man to hero.  We see him struggle with his secrets and his plans, not knowing who to trust since everyone who appears to be on his side also appears to be using him for their own gain.  His decision to stop making weapons comes as a blow to the company and to his partner, Obadiah Stane, and it places him on a rocky path with his friend Rhodey, so Stark finds himself secluded and alone as he attempts to create something huge from his very noble idea.  We get to see Stark grow as a person, and thus become a hero on the inside before truly becoming one in the flesh.<br /><br />The performances here are all wonderful, each and every one.  Downey Jr. owns this movie (this was such a great year for him) but he is helped along by a wonderfully talented cast.  First, we have Jeff Bridges.  This man is gold to me, and here he is just brilliant.  Not only is he dashing in every scene (I really want his wardrobe) but he is also engaging and intriguing (and he has the best character arc).  Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous here as well.  She has received lots of good press for this performance, and rightfully so.  She is the typical conflicted best girl to the hero, but she plays it with such fresh spunk.  Terrence Howard is also very good here.  I'm not a usual fan, but he sold me and I'm actually a little upset they are replacing him with Don Cheadle (I am a huge fan of Cheadle by the way) for the sequel.<br /><br />The film is not as `important' as say `The Dark Knight' was.  `The Dark Knight' was a rare gem in the genre, exposing raw humanity within its scope; but Batman is a much different breed of superhero than Iron Man is.  Marvel comics were never as dark as DC, thus the colorful and action filled approach taken to films like `Spider-Man' and `Iron Man'.  Director Jon Favreau (who also co-stars) does a splendid job of making every scene bounce, giving it this vibrant energy that keeps the audience hooked from the very beginning.  This is a truly enjoyable and memorable superhero movie, filled with effortless charisma, engaging action and truly inspired performances.<br /><br />This has been a great year for superheros.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie!"></head><body><p>Given the spate of disappointing superhero movies over the years, I wasn't terribly excited about "Iron Man."  I probably would never have watched it if my wife hadn't wanted to rent it.  I'm glad she did, or else I would have missed a fun and entertaining movie.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. really made this movie shine.  It's a measure of the writing and direction that film could have succeeded with a different actor as Tony Stark.  But Downey really took the reins and put an indelible mark on the character all his own.  He completely owned every scene he was in.<br /><br />"Iron Man" successfully walked the fine line of taking itself seriously enough that you actually care about what happens without becoming so serious that the whole movie collapses under its own weight.  Favreau and Downey deserve equal credit for that.  And Favreau does a great job of keeping "Iron Man" moving.  Who would have thought back in the day of "Swingers" that Favreau would become a big-time A-list director?  Hollywood often fails to notice talent, so it's great to see him succeed.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent, and the special features are enjoyable.  Perhaps the most special feature is after the end credits, a la Ferris Bueller; be sure to watch until the very end!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to fans of action movies, superhero films, SF movies, or anyone who just plain enjoys a good movie.</p></body></html>

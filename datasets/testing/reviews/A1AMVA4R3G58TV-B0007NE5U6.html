<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Cute"></head><body><p>Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is absolutely adorable as Bridget Jones. She is funny and completely believable with her english accent. Renee's Bridget is "Every Women" - and I can certainly relate to her.<br /><br />Colin Firth is amazingly sexy and handsome in this movie. He was the best thing in the move. Every Woman's Dream man.<br /><br />I loved the sequel, and I hope they continue making more.</p></body></html>

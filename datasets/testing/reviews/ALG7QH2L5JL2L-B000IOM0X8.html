But if you do that, you should be cool with it. Despite the enviro-theme and dastardly, greedy corporations polluting the African continent (or part thereof), this isn't a political thriller. It has the save-the-planet message for good measure and to add a layer of the less-than-trivial, but ultimately it's a from-here-to-there-and-back-again action flick. My entire family, consisting of all grown-ups, enjoyed it. What more can you ask for, really?<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP</p></body></html>

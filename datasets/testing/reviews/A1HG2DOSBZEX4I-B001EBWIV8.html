The problem was that I felt that I had left the world of the original film and entered a video game. The characters are all there but somehow they became Superman clones overnight. <p>What little of the plot there is becomes increasingly confusing due in large part to the fact that what the audience gets is half a movie. Maybe things will be revealed when the final chapter of the trilogy comes out in early November. As the movie opens the machines are drilling towards Zion and Neo must find a way to prevent this attack. We go through the usual machinations of surface plot: Neo must find and rescue the Keymaker who will show him the way to the door to the core of the Matrix where he will be forced to make a choice to save the world or to act in his own self interest.<p>For the most part however the film presents fight scene after fight scene each more elaborate and CGI created. While the wire-fu is interesting I get the feeling that I've seen it all before and don't really need to see it again. The centerpiece of the film is a freeway chase scene that seems to go on forever. The movie is not bad but in the whole is not as great as the sum of its parts.<p>The DVD I viewed presented a crisp picture and soundtrack. Credit once again must be given to director of photography Bill Pope and composer Don Davis. While the set boasted of many special features they really did not amount to much more than extended promotional materials. Particularly bad in this respect were &quot;The Matrix Unfolds&quot; and &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; game promos. The usual making of feature &quot;Preload&quot; was worth a look and so was the detailed Freeway Chase Scene featurette if your interests are inclined that way. Perhaps the best part of the special features section was the spoof of the film for the MTV Movie Awards which is  presented in its entirety.<p>All in all woth a view but we're keeping our fingers crossed that the third chapter will be as great as the promise of the first film.</p></body></html>

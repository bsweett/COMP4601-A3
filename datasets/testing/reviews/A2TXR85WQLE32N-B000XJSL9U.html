<meta name="summary" content="Live Free or Die Hard: The Return of McClane..."></head><body><p>It has been awhile since the last "Die Hard" movie, but this enjoyable summer thriller shows the franchise still has life.  Bruce Willis is surpisingly effective in reprising his role as John McClane, now a lieutenant of detectives in the NYPD, divorced, and trying to run herd on a stubborn teenage daughter.<br /><br />McClane is still a blunt instrument-style cop with a bad habit of turning up at the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, a cyber attack on computer networks in D.C. prompts a request from the FBI, a quick pickup of a geek computer hacker named Ferrell that turns into a fire fight in a quiet neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey. McClane and Ferrell surive the firefight to discover they are caught up in a cyber "firesale", designed by disguntled former DoD cyber security genius Thomas Gabriel (played with youthful menace by Timothy Olyphant) to shut down critical infrastructure all along the Eastern Seaboard.  McClane and Ferrell (appealingly played by Justin Long) humorously work through a generational cultural gap while figuring out Gabriel's plan.<br /><br />The movie is a series of spectacular and increasingly improbable action sequences stitched together by McClane and Ferrell's pursuit of the bad guys from New Jersey to Washington, D.C. to the Maryland countryside and finally to the Baltimore waterfront.  Along the way, McClane's daughter and Ferrell are taken hostage.  The final showdown between McClane and Gabriel is in keeping with the traditions of the franchise.<br /><br />The producers were wise to honor the backstory of John McClane; his characteristic mutterings to himself while about to perform some dangerous act will draw knowing laughs from fans of the franchise.  The basic storyline is ripped from today's headlines, but the solution in this case is a dinosaur, die-hard cop.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as summer entertainment to fans of "Die Hard".</p></body></html>

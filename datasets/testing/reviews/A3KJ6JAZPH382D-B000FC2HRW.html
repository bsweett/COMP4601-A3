<meta name="summary" content="Love Rollercoaster, Ride On It."></head><body><p>Let's face it, roller coasters are one of those terrifying thrills that many of us have a attraction/aversion to on a primal kind of level. It makes the first 15 minutes of "Final Destination 3" truly scary in a white knuckle kind of horror way. It is easily the best thing about this movie, and the bonus disc shows just how much effort they put into making that tiny sequence as authentic as possible.<br /><br />Thus, when Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has her premonition and then starts divining clues from her digital pictures, the blueprint for the very determined force of death offing the survivors (ala the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780631684">Final Destination</a>) is in place. FD3 does so with humor and verve (putting the infamous scream from The Ohio Players' "Love Rollercoaster" was a great touch) while devising increasing grisly and freakish ways to kill off the seven survivors. Trust me, you'll want to swear off tanning beds after this one.<br /><br />The bonus features are what help elevate this DVD to the 4th star. The "Choose Their Fate" option offers both alternative takes and some really funny bonus clips (Frankie Cheeks' in particular) and a cool documentary about the "Dead Teenager Movie," featuring Roger Ebert. For a thrill ride movie, it takes a good perspective on itself.</p></body></html>

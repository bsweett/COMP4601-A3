<meta name="summary" content="A Well-Done Movie With Overwhelming Grisly Scenes."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Seven" starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. It's the story of a vicious sadistic serial killer. Brad Pitt plays a rookie (in this particular police division) and Morgan Freeman plays a veteran detective who is scheduled to retire in a week and both, together, are in pursuit of the insane killer as he selects his victims according to the seven deadly sins. It's a strange mixture of insanity and religious fervor, I suppose. Will they track him down and put an end to his grisly practice?<br /><br />The movie is exceptionally well acted. Morgan Freeman does a convincing job, as I would expect from viewing him in other movies. The surprise was Brad Pitt. I have viewed him as a lightweight and in this movie he does just a splendid job of acting. The other characters are competent. The filming is rather good. The sound is just so-so as the background noise tends to drown out a lot of conversations.<br /><br />Well, it's a quite good movie, but I didn't care for it. There's just an overwhelming amount of gore and grisly scenes. Some of the footage is just stomach churning. What' the point? If a person is dead and shown to be dead, why examine the rotting corpse in detail? I suppose in some instances it might make sense, but with this movie it went way, way over the line. Even though it's a good movie, I would not want to watch it again. Furthermore, I would advise people that if they are sensitive to really grisly scenes, perhaps this is a movie to ignore. But, it's your dime, and it's a worthy movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

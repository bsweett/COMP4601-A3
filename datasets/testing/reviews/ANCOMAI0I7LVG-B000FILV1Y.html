<meta name="summary" content="This film fails at just about everything..."></head><body><p>If ever a films title should persuade you to walk in the other direction, `Failure to Launch' is truly telling.  I am so tempted to give this an `F' and be done with it, but I find that there is at least one redeeming factor in this big pile of unrealistic, clich&eacute;d garbage; the stars.  Yes, no matter how ridiculous and unintelligible and utterly preposterous this lazy mess of a film really is, each and every actor involved does all they can to make it watchable.<br /><br />So, for you Zooey, Matthew, Kathy and Jessica; I give this horrible film a D.<br /><br />The film revolves around Paula, a professional motivator who is hired by Al and Sue, parents of man-child Tripp.  Tripp is approaching his middle-age years and he has yet to move out of the house; causing his parents to resort to Paula as a way to get him out the door.  Of course, as you probably could have guessed, Paula falls in love with Tripp, Tripp finds out that she is scamming him and breaks things off, everyone's life falls apart and then they make up and things are happy again.  The issue I have with the film isn't the formula, because it's become apparent that there really is no other formula available to screenwriters today.  My issue is the reckless abandon with which the screenwriters chose to formulate the formula.  It's just very mediocre, and when it tries to be original (there are far too many animals here) it winds up being so preposterous that it is almost insulting to the audience.<br /><br />Thank God Almighty for the charm and comedic timing of Zooey Deschanel and Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Matthew McConaughey does his usual schtick and looks `super hot' (according to my wife) and so bonus points for him or whatever, but really this movie is not about him.  No, if it wasn't for Parker's undeniable charm and comedic chemistry or Deschanel's flawless timing and sensual draw this movie would have been a complete waste for me.<br /><br />Kathy Bates is generally good in everything, so bonus points for that.<br /><br />In the end though, I hate to say that I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.  In fact, when anyone I know that has seen this finds out that I've seen it they roll their eyes and ask why I didn't turn it off before it started; it is that bad.  There is nothing new, nothing remotely memorable and nothing that warrants repeated viewing at all.  I love you Zooey, and you really worked your cute little buns off to make me enjoy every moment you were on screen; but even your quirky charm cannot save this disgrace from my trash bin.<br /><br />Seeing her made me realize that I NEED to get to the movies and see `(500) Days of Summer' though!</p></body></html>

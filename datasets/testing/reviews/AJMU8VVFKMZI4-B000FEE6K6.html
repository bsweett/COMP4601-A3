Nicholas once again takes control of another character piece.  The problem is a lot of his eccentric characters feels and looks like each other.  Plus, I think he and Morgan Freeman are in some unknown competition of who can narrate the most movies.  First it was difficult to suspend disbelief about Nicholas Cage being Ukrainian--but whatever.  I was quite impressed with Eammon Walker (a dancer turned actor)-quite a commanding presence.  As for the story--it's a pretty descent story, however, hard to believe-Yuri was a one man operation.  As far as the problem with the arms dealers which this film was so eager to point out, is that there is no solution.  None.  This film was basically made to tell you to be afraid--be very afraid.  Oh, yeah...and purchase a gun.  Heaven forbids that you be the only sucker walking around who isn't armed.</p></body></html>

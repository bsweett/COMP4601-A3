<meta name="summary" content="Great Middle East War Film"></head><body><p>When it comes to war movies, alot of the good ones are about WWII and Vietnam. "The Hurt Locker" is the first good war movie that is about "The War on Terror".<br /><br />"The Hurt Locker" is about bomb squad unit that deals with roadside bombs, car bombs, ect. This is a very realistic, because as we all know, the suicided bombings are a big issue for the war.<br /><br />"The Hurt Locker" is a very realistic and entertaining film. Also, you don't have to be a huge war movie fan to enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So wildly derivative, I lost count ."></head><body><p>I especially liked the Butch & Sundance & War of the Roses bits. This is a star driven flick. Unbeknownst to each other  they are rival paid assassins. They have been married for five (or six) years. When they find out & are going after the same target, you know what will happen next. An action movie with lots of laughs. The only thing serious is the amount of $$$ they made to do this. The chemistry between Brad Pitt & Angela Jolie is genuine since they were getting to know each other real well off screen. What a deal. It's not art, it's a flick. Enjoy</p></body></html>

I enjoy this movie loads and watch it time and time again.  I never get tired of the movie no matter how many times I watch the movie Beetlejuice.  The actors did such an amazing job and musical score perfect timing on the exact scenes.  But if you love a good comedy movie and talented actors and a very talented director then pick this movie up and enjoy laugh after laugh time and time again.</p></body></html>

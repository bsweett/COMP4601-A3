From the features, we can sense that the Director is young, dynamic, &amp; enormously talented; a Director that likes to get his hands dirty and be involved in ALL aspects of the production if he manages to find time to do so; a Director that is experimental and willing to embrace changes especially his fling with the digital high density technology that is used in Star Wars prequel; a Director that has a whimiscal sense of humour by introducing a cooking class and in the not long future, fornification class (believe it or not!); a shrewd Director who believes that a profitable and enjoyable movie can be made in the shortest of time by thinking outside the square and willingness to try something new; a Director who still works from his own house and away from Hollywood.  It's obvious he gets so much joy doing the movie &amp; his thoughts are simply rambled through the interview.  He told us the inspiration behind the movie, the connection between this movie &amp; Quentin Tarantino, how El Mariachi came about, &amp; it's also interesting to hear from the actors &amp; actresses of reasons why they would love to work with this new generation Director.  If you have watched Desperado before, you would know what to expect but it's the additional features in this DVD collection that packs a punch. Highly recommended!  Last note, it might be forgettable but Rodriguez reminds us all that movie making needn't be a chore!</p></body></html>

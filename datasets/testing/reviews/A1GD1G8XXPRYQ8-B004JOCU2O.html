It was almost 2 hours long without any death scenes, with a good amount of explosions, and not enough anxiety for me. Not bad, however before I started watching it, I expected a terrorist attack, not just an uncontrollable train by a mistake. So it was a little less action. Still, this is the movie that I was looking forward to see and it was OK.</p></body></html>

Wouldn't you agree?"></head><body><p>This has got to be one of the most powerful (and most visually disturbing) movies to have ever come out of the 2000's. It's more than just a film; it's a piece of reality. Dreams are formed, desired, and shattered (hence the title of the film). It's a stunning piece of work, and a depressing one. Those who have weak stomachs (or had just had a rough day on the job) should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. I personally wasn't depressed by it, but I did care for the characters as they force themselves to make some very bad decisions in life (I'm not going to give the ending away, I promise). All of the actors (especially Ellen Burstyn) are terrific; they are perfectly cast for their roles, and nothing affects their performances. Director Darren Aronofsky has done splendidly with this one. He knows how to create a hardcore drama with his use of quick shots and lighting. All in all, this is a powerful film, and it deserves the high praise that it's continuously receiving as of today. Congratulations to Aronofsky, the cast, and the crew.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

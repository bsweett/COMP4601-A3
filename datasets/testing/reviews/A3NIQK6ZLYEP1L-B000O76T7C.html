<meta name="summary" content="A classic movie..."></head><body><p>Alien is a classic, but it is hard to pin down as what kind - sci-fi or horror or is it set apart from the rest of the movies, a original that set itself higher, above any of the other films, before or after.<br /><br />The Nostromo and her crew are gritty, realistic people, not just characters.  Even the ship is a character in its down right, from the dripping walls, the shaking chains and main computer.<br /><br />Tons of extras and a very interesting commentary from Ridley Scott, who directed it.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is sexy and strong all at the same time.  A must for any Sci-Fi library, right up there with Outland or Silent Running.</p></body></html>

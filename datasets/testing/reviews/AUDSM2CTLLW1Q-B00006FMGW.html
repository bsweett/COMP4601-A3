<meta name="summary" content="Catch this movie if you can!"></head><body><p>December is typically the time of year that movie studios release all of their 'serious' movies just in time to be considered for Oscar nominations.  While this invariably leads to wealth of excellent films to see, most of them are exactly 'fun' to watch.  "Catch Me If You Can" is a welcome break from the dour natures of the films this time of year and is a very entertaining viewing experience.  In fact, if it were not for the Academy of Motion Pictures disdain for comedies and multi-genre films (this would qualify is a 'dramedy'), "Catch Me..." might have a shot at a few Oscars, too.<br /><br />  "Catch Me If You Can" tells the real-life story of one of the most unlikely, accomplished con artists in U.S. History, Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio).  Abagnale was responsible for impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, an assistant attorney general, a history professor, and forging $2.5 million in counterfeit checks.  The real kicker is that he did all this before he even reached the age of 18!  Ironically, Abagnale currently is one of the most sought after experts by banks and business when it comes to check fraud and developing methods to guard against it.  Although there are likely some embellishments to enhance the dramatic value of this movie, "Catch Me..." by and large sticks closely to facts of the story.<br /><br />  In the movie, Abagnale (DiCaprio) first realizes his gift for the con when, at a new school, he takes advantage of a substitute teacher's tardiness and impersonates being a teacher, himself.  It's not important that he didn't have that much greater knowledge over the class material than they other students.  What was important was that he had the charisma and charm to make the rest of the class think he did.  A key scene early in the movie takes place when Abagnale's parents are called to the principal's office because the school found out about Frank's scam.  Instead of coming down hard on Frank, his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (played with understated grace by Christopher Walken), jokes with his son about it and almost seems proud of it.  Frank Sr., unfortunately, is one of those lost souls in life, who seems to have the perfect American family, but is really more of a loser who is watching all he worked for come unraveled (a failing business and a failing marriage).  Frank Sr. seems proud of Frank Jr. because the younger has the ability to actually pull off the scams that the older tries and fails to do.  It's a very telling moment, because it foreshadows the motivation for the path in life Frank Jr. would take because Frank Sr. chose to be a cheerleader rather than a father.<br /><br />  After his parents divorce, Frank Jr. decides to run away and use his 'skill' to make a living.  This is where "Catch Me..." takes the audience on a long journey through the various professions and scams of Abagnale's mentioned above.  To be able to fund his 'adventures', Frank uses his intelligence and charm to discover all manner of ways to get false checks cashed.  As he becomes more adept at this task, he also attracts the attention of FBI Check Fraud division and agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Abagnale begins to move across the country and pick up new professions while managing to stay one step ahead of, but still in contact with, agent Hanratty.  The irony of Hanratty's pursuit of Abagnale is that Hanratty understands Frank better than Frank does, at least in terms why he is doing these scams.  In trying to stop Frank and help him rehabilitate himself, Hanratty becomes the father figure that Frank Sr. never was.<br /><br />  "Catch Me If You Can" is simply one of those funs movies that make the movie going experience worthwhile.  Hanks plays agent Hanratty well as somewhat clumsy, stodgy, and determined pursuer.  Walken gives what could (and should) be an award-winning performance as Frank Sr.  The true pleasant surprise here, though, is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Jr.  After years of self-important behavior and an almost total disappearance from big screen in the aftermath of "Titanic's" massive hype machine, it's nice to see DiCaprio back as a likable character in a good role.  He has probably learned his lessons about what fame can do and, combined with his role in "Gangs of New York", has likely signaled a return to the successful acting career many people expected of him from his earliest days.  In concert with the other fine performances, DiCaprio helps make "Catch Me If You Can" a cinematic treat.</p></body></html>

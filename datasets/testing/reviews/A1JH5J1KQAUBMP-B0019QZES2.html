In this film, they take Pam's uptight parents (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner) to Florida to meet Gaylord's new-age, counterculture, free-thinking parents (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) with predictable consequences.  This film coasts almost entirely on the goodwill generated by its talented cast, but the screenplay doesn't really give them a lot to work with.  Still, it's a pleasure to see DeNiro and Hoffman working together, and the film does manage to generate some good laughs as well as featuring one of the most astounding performances by toddlers (Spencer & Bradley Pickren) that I have ever seen. Was that kid a CGI effect?</p></body></html>

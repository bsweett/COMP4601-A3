<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Borat"></head><body><p>"Borat" is a mockumentary comedy of a fictional Kazakhstani journalist who is seeking cultural enlightenment for his country by visiting America.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen stars as Borat and provides one of the most uproarious performances of his career to date.<br /><br />Some viewers may feel that this film heckles America but it is important to consider that Borat's naivety in displaying acceptable conduct is the essence of the narrative, and his own misguided philosophy makes a fool out of many people, yet he is the butt of all the joking even though he pulls some unwitting people in with him.<br /><br />This movie does have a lot of crude and politically incorrect humour, yet in a world that at times can be too sensitive for its own good, it's a different experience to see a film that breaks all the rules and throws the viewer off their seat with a combination of disbelief and laughter.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

<meta name="summary" content="Wanted: A Director with a Clue (or if that won't do...a script)"></head><body><p>Like an old episode of Starsky and Hutch, The Devil's Rejects  tries real hard to be 70's retro-hip. In reality, this film is nothing short of an abomination. Rob Zombie is without a doubt the worst director (since Ed Wood) to hit the big screen. His use of sound is a joke, every song on the soundtrack has been used in one commercial or another and his side swipe transitions are so past lame. Zombie still has not found his own trademark style. He seems perfectly content ripping off other director's techniques and patching them together as if no one will notice. The Devil's Rejects is totally devoid of a script, a purpose and a reason for being made. If Zombie is trying to relay a message, I guess it would be that "Hey, serial killers are people too". Zombie's attempts to humanize Captain Spaulding, Baby and Otis simply serve no purpose. These people are animals, plain and simple. I don't want to hear a sermon when I go to a horror film, I just want to be scared. Unfortunately, this film is not scary in any sense of the word. Freddy Krueger, oops! I mean Dr. Satan makes a few cameos during the course of the film in the most trite and predictable ways. The Devil's Rejects essentially has no plot and centers around the 3 surviving members of the clan trying to escape from the sheriff (William Forsythe). Wrestling fans may recognize Diamond Dallas Page as one of the bounty hunters that the Sheriff hires to find the gang. I really thought that this film couldn't possibly be any worse than House of 1000 Corpses, but that film looks like Citzen Kane compared to this train wreck. Anyhoo, I'd just as soon burn my $10 then see this film again. This is quite possibly the worst film of the past 10 years...Avoid at all costs.</p></body></html>

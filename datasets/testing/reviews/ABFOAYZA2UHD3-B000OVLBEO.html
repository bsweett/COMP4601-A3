<meta name="summary" content="loved it"></head><body><p>i make a point of seeing any and every movie based on a comic book cuz i'm a fan of both movies and comics.<br /><br />and i have seen how hard it can be to transport the stroy, characters, feelings and mood of a comic book onto the screen.<br /><br />this one (some will say reasonably) succeeded at it - in both overall mood / atmosphere and in great special effects.<br /><br />story?? eeee, stroy is another matter, but in this particular case it doesn't hurt as much as it did in some other comic-based films.<br /><br />cast? cage real good, eva mendes painfully overacting it (but being drop dead gorgeous, so it doesn't matter so much).<br /><br />if you love comics, go see this one.</p></body></html>

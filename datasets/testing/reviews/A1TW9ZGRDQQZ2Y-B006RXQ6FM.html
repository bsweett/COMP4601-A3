The acting by Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams is outstanding as expected, but the movie itself didn't really amount to much at all. It was shorter than I thought it would be (around 100 minutes) and the resolution while realistic, made the movie feel more like a waste of time. Call me crazy, but Viola Davis didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for less than ten minutes of screen time. I had high hopes for this one and even though I did like the film (thanks to the acting), I can't say that I would watch it again or encourage anyone I know to go out and rent it.</p></body></html>

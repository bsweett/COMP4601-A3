<meta name="summary" content="The Rumors are True: This Movie Isn't Very Good"></head><body><p>"Rumor Has It" is a family movie about a woman in search of clues from her past- clues that will help her sort out why she is so different from her real father and give her the wisdom she needs to decide about marriage in general and whether or not it's the right move for her. Rumor Has It, while not a sequel, has similarities to the classic film "The Graduate" and the latter is mentioned several times in this movie.<br /><br />As everyone knows, The Graduate centered around a young man who falls for the seduction of an older woman named Mrs. Robinson and then later falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. In Rumor Has It, a similar situation occurs, except this time around it's Kevin Costner playing the role of ladies man and this time the main character nabs three different generations of a family rather than only two. Jennifer Aniston- one of the few bright spots in this film- falls for the charms of Costner's character and she continues the trend, in spite of the fact that just moments earlier she thought he was her biological father.<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is a little bit interesting but I don't like the way Rob Reiner pulls it all together. The film starts out with good intentions as Aniston's character goes off on a manhunt, hoping to discover that a total stranger is her real father so that she will finally understand once and for all why she is so different from the rest of her family. But rather than make this into an intriguing movie full of personal drama and suspense, Reiner decides to make it a light hearted comedy that starts out running and then slams into a concrete wall about midway through. Once the question about whether or not Kevin Costner is Jennifer Aniston's father has been answered, the movie really loses steam. Reiner doesn't do much else with the movie at this point, allowing it to fizzle out for the next thirty to forty minutes.<br /><br />This movie has been classified as a romantic comedy but it really isn't that funny. I think I counted one funny line through the entire movie (a toast made by Shirley MacLaine to her soon to be married granddaughter Annie). But at the same time, this isn't really a drama either because it lacks the involvement and seriousness one would expect in a good family drama. Again, Reiner let this aspect of the movie get away from him. I'm quite surprised by this, because usually Rob Reiner can be counted on to make some good, solid movies whether they are comedies or serious in nature.<br /><br />Among the performances, only Jennifer Aniston and Shirley MacLaine are up to snuff. The other performances are not very memorable and Mark Ruffalo's character doesn't have much chemistry with Aniston's at all. They don't seem like a good couple and I didn't find myself cheering them on or hoping they would work things out in the end and become the happily married couple that Aniston's parents were not. I really didn't care at this point.<br /><br />Overall, Rumor Has It is a sub- par film that ranks among Rob Reiner's weaker efforts. I wouldn't say it's a total dud because I have seen worse films during the past year. But with an all- star cast like this and with someone with Reiner's experience behind the camera, I expected it to be much better than it turned out.</p></body></html>

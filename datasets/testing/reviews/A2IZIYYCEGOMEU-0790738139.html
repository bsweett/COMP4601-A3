<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST NOIR SINCE CHINATOWN"></head><body><p>This Curtis Hanson flick was sunk by TITANIC at oscar time ( though, I personally, much preferred this gritty, suspenseful, crime-thriller ). The movie has a dream cast, a tight-as-nails script ( by Hanson, and Brian Helgeland ), and fabulous cinematography. The dialogue crackles, and the characters include heroes in varying shades of gray ( Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce ), a fragile femme fatale ( Kim Basinger was never better ), and suave, to coldly monstrous villains. The action is well-paced, and the tension mounts steadily. I loved THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but L.A. CONFIDENTIAL blew me away.</p></body></html>

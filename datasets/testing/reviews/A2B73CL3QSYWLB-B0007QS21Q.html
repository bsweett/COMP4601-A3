If it's primarily an action film then director Alex Proyas has achieved his primary goal of entertaining the audience.  If it is a serious exploration of the nature of artificial intelligence then it suffers somewhat in comparison to films such as "Blade Runner" and "A.I.".  Will Smith continues to grow as both an actor and an action-star here.  His down-to-earth quality helps to cut through alot of the pretenses of the film.  The CGI effects are excellent here.  I feared at some point that the robot animation would overwhelm the flesh-and-blood actors on the screen.  This film is not destined to be a classic of the genre but that should not detract anyone from accepting it for what it is and have a good time.</p></body></html>

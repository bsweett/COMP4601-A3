That's pretty much the case with Source Code.  And why not?  Trying to change the past to improve the present sounds mighty appealing these days.  Anyhow, it's surprisingly fun.  The actors are likable, the pace is reasonably fast and the ending is pretty uplifting for a "brain in a jar" movie.  Originality?  I kept thinking of what happened to Captain Pike at the end of the Star Trek TV episode.  But that's ok.<br /><br />I should also mention that even on my ancient tube television the opening shots of Chicago are just friggin spectacular.  I'm guessing this has to do with the use of a Red camera about which I know little except that it's state of the art.  Either that, or the weather in Chicago has improved dramatically since when I lived there.</p></body></html>

It could be just one additional scene, or a few seconds added here or there.  Either way, this really didn't seem like the movie that was crying out for a extended addition.  We have already had the original release, then the superbit, and now this one.  I guess next it may be the superbit extended version, then the HD/Blue Ray version.  I hate when the studios double and triple dip.  I would rent this one first to see if the extra 11 minutes are worth another purchase.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="On a quality scale of Passion to Braveheart, this one gets an Apocalypto"></head><body><p>I think the fact that people aren't streaming to the theatres to see Apocalypto is proof enough that Passion of the Christ wasn't actually the "modern masterpiece" Christian groups made it out to be. People loved that movie out of religious fervor, not actual cinematic quality. Apocalypto falls somewhere between the brilliance of Braveheart and the Patheticness of Passion. It's just an alright movie.<br /><br />The sheer novelty of a movie about the Mayan civilization, in Mayan, with subtitles, is a draw for some people. And the trailer is beautiful. The movie itself has many beautiful moments, but it never really rises above being a chase movie / supernatural thriller. If it weren't for the awesome locations, costumes, and acting, this movie would be a typical thriller. But it DOES have all those things, so it's actually pretty enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />At times the violence and gore is difficult to deal with, but it can be argued that it's pretty historically accurate. It also makes the entire situation more heightened when you see what's truly at stake and the real ferocious nature of the Mayans.<br /><br />Aside from the violence, I didn't really find anything about the movie to be controversial. Honestly, it's not that deep of a movie. Without revealing too much, here's the general plot: a small village is raided, the villagers are taken for slaves and sacrifices, one of them escapes and is chased through the jungle. That's basically it.<br /><br />I'll leave it up to others to say Mel Gibson is bashing paganism, or drawing comparisons with the war in Iraq, or signalling aliens. I say he made a pretty cool movie that is worth a one-time viewing.</p></body></html>

Everything about this movie is a laugh riot, even the bits of dialogue that aren't punchlines.  The cast is perfect, the writing is perfect... this movie has both Julianne Moore and Flea in it, what other movies can you say that about?  Well, there was the Gus Van Sant "Psycho" remake, but that doesn't count.  I found this movie by accident and I haven't let go of it since.  I may not be a stoner but I will say I've found more happiness since I embraced my inner Dude.<br /><br />Every time I go back to "Lebowski" I come away with something new that wasn't there before.  Like the realization, this time around, that Jeff Bridges is not seen to throw a single bowling ball in the entire movie.  And that Steve Buscemi's character rolls a strike every time we see him... except for the very final scene, for reasons that become clear a few moments later.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is just superb.  Remember Philip Seymour Hoffman as an unctuous PR man?  I'd forgotten about that.  Jon Polito (late of "Homicide") shows up as a P.I. in a familiar-looking purple VW bug.  Even Aimee Mann is in one scene, speaking German.  Oh, and Tara Reid, before her career completely and utterly collapsed.  Top supporting honors go to Sam Elliott, who according to the DVD documentary wasn't even sure what he was doing in the movie, but his opening narration gets funnier every time out ("And in English, too!").<br /><br />Another great thing is the dialogue.  You'd think the whole movie was done by improv, the way the dialogue is so natural.  Every character has their own particular jargon, and just like in real life, people keep repeating phrases they've heard elsewhere.  Jeff Bridges can't seem to finish a sentence, and neither can Steve Buscemi, although that's because John Goodman won't let him.  George Bush gets quoted a lot ("This aggression will not stand, man").<br /><br />Finally, I love the totally unglamorous portrayal of L.A. and Hollywood, limited to tiny theaters, a seedy bowling alley, a weapons store in the barrio, and the In 'n Out Burger (on Camrose).  The actor and artist type characters who show up are all obnoxious or pathetic, particularly David Thewlis's "video artist", and the chubby dancer/landlord who forgoes collecting rent from the Dude so long as the Dude shows up for his performances.  Not to mention Karl Hungus and the great Ben Gazarra cameo.<br /><br />But in the end, Jeff Bridges is the glue holding this movie together... and John Goodman... and John Turturro... and... and... aah!  Lost my train of thought here.  But... ah, [...], I've done introduced 'em enough.</p></body></html>

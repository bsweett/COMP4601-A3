<meta name="summary" content="See It for Streep's Master Class Artistry"></head><body><p>That Meryl Streep would be brilliant in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is a given and should be enough to justify a film's existence, but this sympathetic 2011 historical biopic does not give the actress enough to work with in what amounts to a charitable and cursory view of a controversial figure. Director Phyllida Lloyd had directed Streep in one of her lighter recent efforts, 2008's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GKJ2DY">Mamma Mia!</a>, where caricature and fleet footing worked together to keep the bouncy ABBA-penned score from touching ground. This time, however, a more definitive grounding would have been beneficial to provide Thatcher's story with much-needed perspective. Unfortunately, screenwriter Abi Morgan's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FXLZ9K">Shame</a>) episodic patchwork of a script takes no sides in presenting the life and career of one of the most influential world leaders of the 20th century. Instead, amid moments of genuine poignancy, her story is tethered to the ravages of old age and the onset of dementia, presenting the still-living Thatcher as an almost Dickensian character dependent on the ghost of her eccentric late husband Denis for personal support.<br /><br />In fact, the film opens circa 2008 with Thatcher in a semi-senile state venturing out to buy milk at a local convenience store. Even though she is immersed in imaginary conversations with Denis, she is preparing to dispose of his clothes eight years after his death at the behest of her daughter Carol. After this lengthy introductory sequence, the story starts to traverse back and forth between extended flashbacks and her present-day solitude. We see her as the devoted daughter of a Grantham grocer, worshipful of her father but distant from her mother as Thatcher takes an interest in national politics starting at the lowest rungs of the Conservative party. From these early-day scenes, it's difficult to tell how or why she climbed to the top of the party because there is barely a glimmer of the ruthless ambition and savvy positioning that must have been Thatcher's forte to get ahead. Instead, we get the Cliff's Notes version that cuts to the high points of her career, so significant turning points come across as little more than a dramatic checklist.<br /><br />Running a blessedly brief 105 minutes, the film tackles in quick succession her Conservative stand at Parliament, her pointed challenge to Edward Heath for leadership of the party, her unfettered decision to send troops to defend the Falkland Islands, and her forced resignation in the face of hubris and waning popularity. Interspersed throughout is archival footage of the real Thatcher (with her face hidden, of course) during her twelve years as Prime Minister, the longest of any in the last century. Had Lloyd and Morgan reined in the breadth of Thatcher's life and zeroed in on a defining moment like the Falkland Islands war, the film would have been more dramatically effective in revealing the true figure. There is, however, no faulting Streep (with seamless assistance from her long-time make-up assistant J. Roy Helland) whose uncanny resemblance and authoritative performance commands attention most willingly. The surrounding cast barely has time to make any vivid impressions with the exceptions of Jim Broadbent's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067J3R">Iris</a>) sprightly, familiar turn as Denis and Alexandra Roach's wide-eyed impersonation of the younger Margaret. Otherwise, the pacing feels off due to Justine Wright's choppy editing and Elliot Davis' overly artful camera angles. See it purely for Streep's artistry.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Entertaining & Action-Packed Dark Sci-Fi Adventure"></head><body><p>In 2000, writer/director David Twohy introduced the world to his dark hero character named Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) in the sci-fi/film noir film entitled "Pitch Black".  Four years later, he wrote/directed the sequel that was entitled "The Chronicles of Riddick".  In this action-packed film noir sequel, Riddick, after having been on the run for five years, has been captured by a group of bounty hunters lead by a man named Toombs (Nick Chinlund).  While en route to the planet Helion Prime (where the bounty on Riddick was initiated), Riddick escapes and takes over Toombs ship.  He lands on Helion Prime and goes in search for Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David, a returning character/actor from "Pitch Black").  Unfortunately, Helion Prime has also become the latest target of conquest for a group called the Necromongers that are essentially the living-dead (not vampires though).  The Necromonger attack fleet wreaks havoc upon the population of Helion Prime, whose survivors are then given the "opportunity" to become Necromongers themselves by their leader known only as Lord Marshal (Colm Feore).  Many refuse this "offer", including Riddick who is also present.  Riddick is taken by the Necromongers for further questioning at the request of a woman named Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton), who is the wife to a leading Necromonger general named Vaako (Karl Urban).  Using Necromongers conditioned to be powerful mind-readers, the Necromongers quickly discover that Riddick is a Furian, which is a race that Lord Marshal fears most.  Though Riddick is able to escape from the Necromongers, he is again captured by Toombs and his latest crew who decide to take him to an extremely inhospitable penal planet called Crematoria.  It is there that Riddick comes across the prisoner Kyra (Alexa Davalos), but Lord Marshal is determined to recapture Riddick, so he sends Vaako and a group of Necromonger soldiers in pursuit from Helion Prime.<br /><br />With a combination of elaborate sets, CGI special effects, dark cinematography and good costuming, "The Chronicles of Riddick" is visually very entertaining.  The plot is interesting and the dialog is fair; but the editing was not as good as it could have been. Overall, though, it's an entertaining and interesting film that I rate with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other notable characters include the elemental human Aereon (Judi Dench), the Necromonger Purifier (Linus Roache), The Guv of the Crematoria prison (Yorick van Wageningen), Lajjun (Kimberly Hawthorne), Ziza (Alexis Llewellyn) and Eve Logan (Christina Cox).</p></body></html>

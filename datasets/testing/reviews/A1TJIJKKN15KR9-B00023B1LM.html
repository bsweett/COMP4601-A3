The action scenes, brief and scattered as they may be, are very well done and (mostly) grounded, especially by Hollywood standards. It's not quite as smart as it would like you to believe, but is intelligent enough to avoid becoming a stereotypically brainless puncher, and I enjoyed the constantly-flipping roles of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between Bourne and his handlers. The ending was too abrupt, tying everything up into too neat of a package and omitting a lot of vital details along the way, but I guess that's what the sequels were for.</p></body></html>

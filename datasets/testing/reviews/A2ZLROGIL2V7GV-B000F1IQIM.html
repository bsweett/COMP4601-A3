Is it a Shakespearian masterpiece?  Of course not.  Is it a shoot-'em-up and go-for-broke adventure filled with power and entertainment?  Heck, yeah!  This is a film that proves to be a good time--especially for those who want a real action movie that has a unique touch to it.  While it may be over-the-top at times, it's a breath of fresh air for those who have been disappointed with some of the latest action blunders.<p>The film is Robert Rodriguez's final chapter in the &quot;El Mariachi&quot; saga, completing the trilogy.  Antonio Banderas returns as the lone gunman who has a passion for guitars.  Unable to escape his horrific past, he gets an opportunity to get revenge against the person who has caused him so much dread.  The person who offers him the job is a crooked CIA agent--a man who does not hesitate to get his hands bloody in order to get what he wants.  A simple meeting between the two unleashes a complex and even sometimes downright confusing story with twists and turns around every corner.  You don't know who is playing who until the very end in this exciting thrill-ride that is both exhilarating and humorous.<p>I really enjoyed watching &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico.&quot;  I've been so disappointed with some of the most recent action flunkies that have been released in the past few months.  It's a highly entertaining movie that resembles a hi-tech western filled with top-notch action sequences that are absolutely exhilarating.  The movie is most certainly violent and gory, so it is not recommended for the squeamish.  However, I must point out that a good majority of the violent sequences are cartoonish and purposely over-the-top.  I also must point out that even though this is the end of a trilogy, it doesn't mean that the only way to enjoy this movie is if you have seen the other two movies, &quot;El Mariachi&quot; and &quot;Desperado.&quot;  I can say this with confidence, as I have yet to see those two movies (although I did see parts of &quot;Desperado&quot;).  This may not be the best one in the series, but I have a feeling it is the most entertaining.<p>The movie has an impressive roster when it comes to casting.  It's been awhile since I've seen so many big names in one movie.  You have Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, Mickey Rourke and William Dafoe.  And that's only naming a few.  Everybody is really great in their roles, although I have to confess that Johnny Depp is what really makes the movie.  He steals every single scene that he is in.  His character is a great creation and is a joy to watch.  The downside to the movie is that the story tries too hard to be too complex at times.  You really are confused through more than a good half of the movie when you first see it.  This is in no way a major flaw, but it is a flaw nonetheless.<p>The DVD has a ton of goodies to offer for you DVD fanatics.  The first thing that has to be brought up is the glorious picture quality!  The film was shot in High Definition--and it really shows.  It's crystal clear and beautiful.  The picture looks ten times better than it would have if it were shot on plain film.  The sound is pretty decent, although I think they could've stepped it up a notch.  Extras included are deleted scenes, featurettes, commentary, trailers and more.  The featurettes are really interesting to watch.  A great suggestion is to watch them after you've seen the film, and then watch the movie again right after you do that.  Chances are that your appreciation for the movie will grow.  I know it did for me.  A very impressive DVD package, I must say.<p>&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; is a great time if you're looking for an exciting action-packed event.  It's not one to choose if you're looking for a movie with a deeper meaning to it all.  This is one to choose if you simply want to have a good time and want to be entertained.  This is certainly a film that I will be watching numerous times.  The end result is a thrilling joyride from Robert Rodriguez that stands out from most of the other action flicks.  Strap in and enjoy the ride. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

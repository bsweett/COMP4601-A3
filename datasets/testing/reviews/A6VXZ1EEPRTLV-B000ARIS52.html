The result of his dedication and vision, is a stylistic, visually striking, technically impressive, near perfect homage, to Miller's world of crime, violence, romance, revenge, women, and vice.  Miller had no plans for a Sin City film, but when Rodriguez demonstrated to him what the film could be, Miller got onboard the project as a co-director.  Using the graphic novels as the source, Rodriguez clearly envisioned technically how the film could be made, and transformed that concept into a reality that even exceeded the expectations of Frankie Miller, authentically capturing the look, style and atmosphere of Sin City.<br /><br />Another major contributor to the film's success is its amazing cast.  From top to bottom, Rodriguez enlisted a parade of top flight talent that is quite unique.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Torro, Jaime King, Carla Gugino, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, and Elijah Wood, head what is one of the more remarkable casts in a film of this decade, one that also includes Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett and Marlee Shelton in minor roles.<br /><br />Presented predominantly in black and white, the original version of Sin City cleverly blends several stories together in a fashion that holds together pretty cohesively, although the tonality of The Big Fat Kill incorporates a  bit more humor than the rest.  The performances are all strong, particularly considering the challenges of acting against a sterile green screen.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke, both rise to the top with gritty, powerful, and emotional performances.<br /><br />There are a ton of extras in this edition, including several commentaries, and numerous featurettes covering various facets of the production.  Lots of cool secrets are revealed in 'Fifteen Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez'.  Shooting against a green screen, enabled scenic elements to be inserted in post production.  The extent to which this cool technique was employed, can be seen in 'The All Green Screen Version'.  There is also a short documentary about how Frankie Miller was convinced to greenlight and join the production.<br /><br />The film has been recut, with some additional footage added, into the four separate stories, The Customer is Always Right, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye, and The Big Fat Kill.  They appear on Disc 2, and can be viewed in any order.  Also included is a copy of The Hard Goodbye graphic novel.  The recut, extended version (DVD or Blu Ray), costs more, but if you enjoy Sin City, this is certainly the one to get.<br /><br />Amazon should revise their policy of regarding different versions of the same movie as being equivalent.  This two disc recut version, not the same as the regular edition single disc release.  This situation widespread, and leads to confusion for those seeking specific information about what special features and extras may be included in any particular edition.  This policy not realistic, and does not serve the best interest of consumers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you open Pandora 's box, then do not mourn yourself!"></head><body><p>It has been told so many times: we have withdrawn so far from Mother Nature that we tend to forget it. So, intrenched in our own modern Trojan world, we are trapped in our words `s jungle: even we dare to believe in certain imported mind terms with such strong that we use to think they exist.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is in last instance, the tempting Pandora `s box, the final choice and golden opportunity to recreate thanks our undeniable genetic advance, a part of the lost world in the night of the times, in our ancestral genes and the minutely investigation of scientists, investigators and Historians. Once more Michael Crichton  retook the ancient myth: to look behind , immersed in Orpheus punishment respect his wife,  Eurydice,  Lot `s woman in the Holy Scriptures and finally in Goethe `s Faust.<br /><br />The script is a bitter vision about the eternal and never satisfied love for the knowledge, to challenge the question: what if I ... ?  The final result was an admirable exercise of vivid and unconscious terror respect our antipodes, the recreation of a primitive world; a entry through the tunnel of the time to experience the primordial fears with its logical consequences.<br /><br />Perhaps the film made no use of the mythical load immersed within this post modernist tale.

After all, most sequels that come along this late are usually pointless and can't capture the magic of their predecessor or just flat out stink. "Hannibal," though surely a different film, does not stick to routine sequel formula. This film stands by itself. Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter and Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Both actors do superb jobs, especially Julianne Moore (who I have always liked) who had a lot to live up to. Clarice, having just been accused of botching a drug-bust, is temporarily stripped of her duties as an FBI agent and is put to the task of revisiting an old-case of hers: Hannibal Lecter. She is given the job of tracking him down, and after receiving a letter from "H," she slowly, but surely, pinpoints his location: Florence, Italy. Problems arise as another detective in Florence is on Hannibal Lecter's trail after receiving word of a large award granted by one of Hannibal's victims, who wants nothing more to see "H" suffer and who will pay any price. The movie relies on a lot of gore. Gallons more than "Silence of the Lambs" did. Exposed brains, exposed intestines, exposed skulls, it's all here and it's about as nasty as it's R-rating will allow it to be. But still, the movie maintains it's dignity, despite being an all-out gorefest. The movie is both beautiful and terrifying. Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) did an excellent job directing. Like the title says, he does a superb job of balancing style with substance. Purists will hate it because it is a lot different from "Silence of the Lambs" and even "Manhunter." But, really, the movie is it's own movie, and if you keep that in mind, you too will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

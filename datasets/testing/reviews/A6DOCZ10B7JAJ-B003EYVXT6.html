It had a fairly large budget.  A top-notch acting crew.  It was co-produced by the awesome Guillermo Del Toro.  Plus it's been praised by critics and audiences alike.  There was no way for me to expect such a horrific disaster.  Seriously, there were so many serious developments in this film that I was constantly cracking up at inappropriate times.  Some just unbelievably silly stuff.  The filmmakers had high hopes here but really created a monster turd.<br /><br />The problems with this film start from the onset and just metamorphosize from there.  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are never too convincing as the top-notch genetic scientists.  It's not really their fault though, as this script makes them out more like underground hobo science nerds.  They drive a ramshackle 70's Gremlin and live in a cruddy apartment.  I guess with the bad economy they were forced to take their jobs making minimum wage.<br /><br />So these two drastically underpaid researchers have fun splicing and dicing around in the billion dollar lab they work at.  They make an incredible medical breakthrough as they create a new life form.  The wormy creatures they conjour up look like cute little Tremors babies.  These slimy little buggers are strangely interesting, but really amount to nothing more than a scientific stepping stone.<br />The two genius gene doctors realize they are on the edge of something so much more.  With visions of possible cures for Alzheimer's disease or cancer, they want to incorporate human DNA into their experiments.  Unfortunately their boss shuts down this plan real quick.  So not fair.<br />Well, this doesn't slow the mad scientists from their medical pursuits.  Heck, it's for the benefit of mankind.  Luckily the pharmaceutical company pays little attention to their work or the resources they use.  So they buckle down for the rest of the night and are able to create a new half-human life form named Dren.  Boo-yah!  Dren rapidly develops some breasts and a lethal stinger tail, causing all sorts of unexpected problems.<br /><br />I really thought this story sped through all the scientific developments way too fast, making this questionable outcome even more implausible.  The making of Dren seemed way too easy.  Not to mention the fact that keeping this mutant baby a secret was way too far-fetched.  Still, at this point the story was holding my interest.  It was not until the couple smuggle their creation out of the lab that it reaches new levels of absurdity.<br />Dren's new home is in an abandoned farmhouse.  Instead of running more tests on this creature, both of the doctors become emotionally attached to their project.  Hugs, kisses, dressing it(her?)up, applying makeup, teaching Dren to slow dance...it gets so dang preposterous.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but the nonsense here gets even more shockingly bizarre and flat-out stupid.  So many ludicrous moments, this movie derails like a bad train wreck. I couldn't help but glare at the screen with utter disgust and disbelief.  SPLICE has a very interesting premise, as it juggles scientific discovery with ethics and consequences.  I also enjoy seeing the horror genre receive critical acclaim.<br /><br />But I can't hop on this goofy, deranged bandwagon.  It violates a very serious genre of sci-fi horror with unforgivable missteps.  I'm telling you, it's bad, bad, BAD!  SPLICE has high aspirations but ends up being unintentionally funny.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as funny as it should have been"></head><body><p>I think my expectations were set too high since I was told it was "like The Hangover" - they are similar in some respects but Bridesmaids lacks the clever plotting, carefully planned payoffs and inherent likability of the broken characters.<br /><br />Bridesmaids has a couple of extremely funny scenes linked together by a very predictable story but it never really delivers on the promise of the premise. Kristin Wiig's character is a mashup of the SNL roles she's played in the last season and comes across as annoying and unbearable. Maya Rudolph snoozes her way through the film and doesn't really have any funny scenes to play to. The Unrated edition has some over-the-top dialog that doesn't really add anything to the film.<br /><br />Still, in a year of pretty bad films, it's not a terrible film - just not a particularly good one.</p></body></html>

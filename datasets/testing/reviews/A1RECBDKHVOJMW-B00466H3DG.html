<meta name="summary" content=""Why remember a destructive love affair?""></head><body><p>Meet Joel Barish, a "nice," shy, unassuming man, played by a much understated Jim Carrey. Meet Clementine Kruczynski, a wacky, spontaneous, uninhibited woman who colors her hair as often as she brushes her teeth. Kate Winslet is brilliant here. She bounces with energy as the vibrant Clem. And Carrey gives one of his most mature, deeply felt performances as Barish. Joel and Clementine meet each other. Sparks fly. It's love. The conventional and the eccentric collide. More sparks - a veritable conflagration. And then the inevitable. Kaput! Abruptly. Painfully. Clementine wants to "wash that man right outta her hair," so she literally has him removed from her mind. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, (Tom Wilkinson), invented a procedure to erase isolated, unwanted memories. He provides this process through his company, Lacuna. Ever unpredictable, Clementine decides this is for her. The next time the ex-couple meets, Clementine acts as if she has never seen Joel before. Joel is astounded, confused. A friend, (the very funny David Cross), finally tells Joel that he has been erased. Devastated and depressed, Joel decides to have the same procedure performed.<br /><br />Most of the film's action takes place inside Joel's head. Hooked up to the memory-erasing apparatus, which pinpoints each Clementine-related memory in his brain and zaps it, he relives every moment before it's wiped-out. The emotional sense of loss is magnified, as one memory after another is visually annihilated. Unconscious, Joel realizes these moments are far too precious to destroy. Is it too late to save them?<br /><br />"Why remember a destructive love affair?"  So asks, Dr. Mierzwiak, who presides over a hearty-partying Lacuna staff, which includes: Patrick, the unethical technician, (Elijah Wood), who uses ill-gained information to court Clementine; Mary, the ditzy receptionist, (Kirsten Dunst), who fools around with senior technician, Stan, (Mark Ruffalo), while her heart lies elsewhere. This off-beat gang of unprofessionals is responsible for the comic relief. They bring unlooked for depth to their roles also.<br /><br />Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman takes us on a roller-coaster ride through the remarkable landscape of Joel Barish's mind. This unbelievable visual collage of memories, and shifted, twisted realities, is absolutely brilliant and most memorable. The cinematography, (Ellen Kuras), is amazing! Dreams morph into reality then fade back to fantasy, while people disappear in mid-stride, as Joel's brain cells are destroyed. There are no boundaries here.<br /><br />WOW! What a whimsical, delightful, poignant, refreshing gem of a film! I laughed out loud at times, and my eyes teared-up at others. Jim Carrey and Ms. Winslet really shine and emphasize, with their performances, our very human need for love. Eternal Sunshine's premise is that we need each other, even during those periods when being together interferes with being happy. As someone once said, "love is hard." And "Eternal Sunshine" is, above all else, an original love story. The movie's title is a quotation from Alexander Pope's poem "Eloisa to Abelard:" "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind/ Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."<br /><br />Kudos to director Michel Gondry, and Charlie Kaufman. This is one of the best films I have seen in ages!<br /><br />JANA</p></body></html>

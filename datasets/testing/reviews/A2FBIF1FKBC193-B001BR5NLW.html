<meta name="summary" content="An action Sci Fi movie at its best ... non stop visuals ...."></head><body><p>Even though it would be best that the viewer see 'Dark Fury' and animated film, with Van Diesel as the voice of Riddick, to give you an insight into the background of 'Riddick' the dark character, it is not critical however to enjoy the live movie 'The Chronicals ....'<br /><br />To say that the movie is 'action packed' would not do it justice since many of the so called action packed flicks that I have seen recently only displsy action at the box office ticket counter! Same thing with 'special effects' .... trust me ... you havent seen special effects until you pop this DVD into the player.<br /><br />I understand that Van Diesel was very much involved in the creative process of this movie and most certainly it's his acting that makes it both believable and work. Unfortunately I can't say that I'm an 'aficionado' of the series or the genre and I was lucky enough to have my son with me when we watched to film to explain some of the undercurrents ..... The DVD itself has numerous bonus tracks for those of you that have to see this film 'cold' ..... The extra tracks are superb and you'll be able to call yourself a Riddick 'expert' in a flash .....<br /><br />Since it's not the kind of movie that spoon feeds the viewer, slapping you in the face with the obvious, I have a fear that it may be a while till the next of this series is cut. Too bad cause I think that this is a must have DVD .....</p></body></html>

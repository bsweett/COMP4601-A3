<meta name="summary" content="A satisfying, exciting film with two nice performances"></head><body><p>Normally, I can barely tolerate Tony Scott's frantic, even frenzied, directing style.  He's all about fast cuts, swooping angles and cursory character development.  He's often a bit like Michael Bay, with at least with a better visual sense.  His films often indicate changes in time or mood through a change in color saturation.  You CANNOT see one of his films and not constantly be reminded that you're watching a movie.  Films like MAN ON FIRE and TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 give me a headache.<br /><br />UNSTOPPABLE is a film that finally has Scott back on track (pun intended).  His directing style hasn't changed...heck, it even stars his constant collaborator Denzel Washington.  But the story matches his style.  A runaway train, however scary such a thing might be, can pretty much only go straight and predictably...but Scott's over-baked sound mix, crazy editing and challenging camera angles make this hurtling train feel like a living monster.<br /><br />The story is set in Pennsylvania.  At one end of the state, a bunch of useless railyard workers, through a series of bad choices, send a train pulling a large load of toxic chemicals on its way with the throttle down and no one on board.  Coming in the other direction are various obstacles...and another freight train carrying experienced railman Denzel and rookie conductor Chris Pine (from the recent STAR TREK).  Eventually, these two guys find themselves needing make some difficult choices in order to try to stop this crazy train from killing thousands of people.  That's really about all the film is about...yet it is very gripping.<br /><br />We learn (or feel like we're learning) a lot about the workings of trains and rail systems.  Rosario Dawson, in a thankless role, is the person in the control booth with all the lights and microphones and computers around her (you know, sort of like the room Washington sat in for most of TAKING OF PELHAM...).  Her job is to spout statistics and physics, and to get into ridiculous yelling matches with the corporate suits, who can't make a single reasonable decision.  It's one thing to try to cast scorn on corporate types...it's another to make them behave about as brightly as a teenager in a slasher movie.<br /><br />But the movie rests very comfortably on the shoulders of Washington and Pine.  Washington is in coasting mode, relying primarily on his still considerable charisma.  But he's smart and funny, and is simply a professional doing a great job of playing another professional in another profession.  But best of all is Pine.  I liked him a lot in STAR TREK (as Captain Kirk), but I worried that he was getting by on good looks and a smart mouth, coupled with a spectacle of a movie.  But here, he's still "hunky", but he feels blue collar and convincing.  When called upon to act bravely, he doesn't come off as a hero, but as a guy making tough choices in order to protect loved ones.  The two men have good chemistry...there's a little bit of the "old timer giving the new kid a hard time" banter...but less than I would have expected.  I wouldn't say their scenes are particularly well-written; they simply do a nice job with what they've got.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the two trains hurtle, helicopters fly, mishaps and crashes occur all leading up to a remarkably tense and exciting final 15 minutes.  UNSTOPPABLE is not a classic action film...but it is a very worthy effort and it made for an excellent evening at the movies.  I also liked that it is a comfortable PG-13...there was plenty of noise and crashing, but no gratuitous death and gore.  It was a good blue collar film about some great blue collar guys.</p></body></html>

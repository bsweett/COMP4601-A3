After all, it could very well be the last Star Trek film ever.  However, this film has such major problems that it can't be viewed as more than a mediocre Trek entry.<br /><br />The entire first hour of this film is borderline boring.  Star Trek film usually take a while to get going, but "Nemesis" takes this to absurd lengths.  Other than a shocking opening scene, very little happens in the film's first act, with the exception of the car chase (more on that atrocity later).  With the exception of Stewart, none of the actors here stand out.  The Trek regulars are obviously trying because they knew this would be their last gyst, but they still come off as dull, and Worf is turned into a comic sidekick.<br /><br />The guest list in "First Contact" and "Insurrection" was impressive- Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Kridge, F. Murray Abraham, Anthony Zerbe, Donna Muprhey.  Here, we're instead stuck with Tom Hardy and Dina Meyer.  Hardy obviously tries as the villain Shinzon, but he's hampered by the fact that he bears no resemblance to Picard (who's supposedly his doppleganger) and that he spends half the film trying to imitate Khan (Trek villains really need to stop that; no one will ever again match Khan).  Meyer shows no energy whatsoever.  The only good guest star is Ron Perlman, but he's criminally underused (see "Hellboy" for what this guy is capable of).<br /><br />The greatest flaw of "Nemesis" is that it is, at heart, a dumb action film.  This is Star Trek Lite.  I suppose it was inevitable.  Star Trek films have always been about ideas over action, but in the age of loud explosions and mindless thrills (after all, Jerry Bruckheimer is now one of the most successful producers ever), this formula has come to look like a dinosaur to mainstream audiences.  The Star Trek producers would inevitably try to make the franchise appeal to mainstream audiences again by sacrificing Star Trek's very soul, while at the same time trying to keep hardcore fans on board.  The result is a film that is still too talky and slow for mainstream audiences, but is dumbed down just enough to piss off Trekkies.<br /><br />Case in point is the "car chase" early on in the film.  It has little importance to the plot, and it's downright stupid.  Of course, it is competently done, but you never get the feeling when you're watching it that this is a Star Trek film- it could have been pulled out of any Bruckheimer picture.  I'm not even getting into the flaws that geeks spot, such as how the Enterprise crew in this sequence basically ignores all Federation protocol.<br /><br />If it sounds like I'm roasting "Nemesis," let me say that it's not a BAD movie in the sense that "The Final Frontier" was.  Indeed, "Nemesis" can be lauded for doing one thing right- saving its best for last.  All of its memorable moments happen in the final 40 minutes, which contain such impressive and tense space battles that you almost forget everything stupid that's happened before.  Almost, that is.<br /><br />I gave both "Insurrection" and "Nemesis" three stars, but "Insurrection" is the superior film, if only because it tries to stick to the Star Trek formula.  "Nemesis" is a misguided attempt to reshape Star Trek into an action franchise, and it simply doesn't fit.  Star Trek is supposed to be about more than space battles and explosions.  I don't know if there will ever be another Trek film, but "Nemesis" shows what happens to good franchises when their producers decide that they must be dumbed down for mainstream tastes (see the 1989-1997 "Batman" franchise for another example of this).  It is an enjoyable film with some great action scenes, but it has little else.  And Star Trek deserves better.</p></body></html>

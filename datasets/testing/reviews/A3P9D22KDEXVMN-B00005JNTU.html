<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Four worth Three Stars"></head><body><p>The bar for comic book movies has been set pretty high with the success and quality of films such as the Batman and Spiderman series; not to mention Superman.  The greaat thing about this movie is that the Fantastic Four gets the star treatment here rather than some B movie that does not do the comic series justice.  Admittedly, I was only a casual F4 fna as a kid.  This movie was very entertaining and is never dull.  The actors are compelling and the story is decent.  There are some fun scenes with nifty special effects.  A couple of cool scenes include a time where the team comes together in a fight with Doctor Doom and they all use their powers collectively, and a scene where the Thing and Doctor Doom fight at the bottom of a pool.  Enjoy this movie for what it is... a solid three star fun flick that looks great on DVD.</p></body></html>

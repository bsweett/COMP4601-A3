<meta name="summary" content="Organized-Crime Saga"></head><body><p>This is the chilling saga of the Corleone family's rise and fall from Sicilian crime roots to powerful criminal ties in the United States. Representing one of the leading crime families, two generations of Corleones struggle to maintain their grip. 'The Godfather', Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), is portrayed as an older man with sons Sonny (James Caan) and Michael (Al Pacino) taking an equal family position to non-Italian adopted son Hagen (Robert Duval).<br /><br />Part I is a prequel to The Godfather Part II, yet stands as a completely independent story.<br /><br />The story line comes across as extremely believable and provides a history of organized crime in the United States.</p></body></html>

Then seeing the film adaptation spurred me on to reading MRS DALLOWAY yet again.  Now the DVD is out and I rank THE HOURS with my top five movie favorites.  Cunningham's genius-quality response to Virginia Woolf's novel, MRS DALLOWAY, successfully admixes one day in the lives of three women from different times - Virginia Woolf in 1923 as she devises her novel and the characters' fates; Laura Brown a fragile housewife/mother teetering on self destruction, and Clarissa Vaughn in 2001 an editor and mother in a longterm lesbian relationship - planning a &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;-type party for her AIDS ridden poet friend Richard. David Hare has written a screenplay that seamlessly weaves these three women's lives through the hours of one day: Virginia Woolf inhales, Clarissa exhales, Laura Brown stares into the same type space as both Virginia and Clarissa.  The result is a wondrous, intimate exploration of the value of living, a value than can without censure include taking one's own life.  The dialogue is mesmerizing, a script (and book) that leaves you wishing you could memorize each word and line.  Every one of the &quot;company&quot; roles is acted (and directed) with uncanny finesse - Toni Colette, Ed Harris, Allyson Janney, Charles Reilly  - all of them.  The Phillip Glass music score is the perfect choice to meld these ingredients into an unforgetable film.  Another great joy of buying this DVD is the additional history of Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group, the enlightened (for once) dialogue among Nicole Kidman, Myrl Streep, and Julianne Moore, and the comments by composer Glass, writers Cunningham and Hare, and director Daldry paying homage to a project which all began with Virginia Woolf.  I cannot recommend this movie/DVD more highly. It is simply and uniquely  exquisite.</p></body></html>

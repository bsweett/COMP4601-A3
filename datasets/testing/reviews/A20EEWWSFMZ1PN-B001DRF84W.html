Now to compound the problem he passes a trait onto his offspring Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Add a little lab accident and et voila instant hulk.<br /><br />This is not the best integration of real, animation and CGI. Blu-ray can not mask the fact that this is mostly cartoon. Yet the story is told and you have fun watching. There is a father / son conflict and a misunderstood Hulk dismantles a lot of military equipment with extreme prejudice. This film does not try to follow the TV series and is not so dated. The only real drawback is that Jennifer Connelly is just too cute and you forget to keep track of the story line.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AWYOGE">Dark Water (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A 5 Star Performance by Foxx in a 3 1/2 star Film"></head><body><p>Jamie Foxx was either holding out on us or just waiting for the right platforms to display his amazing talent.  His two Oscar nominations this year - Best Supporting Actor for "Collateral" and Best Actor for THIS movie - are well deserved.  The man can ACT.  He is so successful at inhabiting a role here - I wouldn't bat an eye if I heard he were playing Ronald Reagan in an upcoming film.<br /><br />Ray Charles was also a stunning once-in-a-lifetime talent, and the combination of Foxx's ability working with the Charles' material is extremely pleasurable.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx so completely inhabits the personna of Ray Charles that disbelief is totally suspended.  In our minds he IS Ray Charles.<br /><br />All that being said - it's impossible to make a coherent "story" from 20 years of disconnected interludes and anecdotes from Ray's life.  We see young Ray growing up with a mother who wants more for her son than the poverty he is born into.  She challenges him in ways that border on cruelty after he becomes blind, but the movie suggests that it is the hard lessons he learned while young that drove him to greatness later.<br /><br />We see the young musician Ray, winning the respect and adulation of fans and musicians alike while playing Country, then blending Blues and Gospel to make Soul music.  We see Ray the long-time heroin addict who doesn't think it is a "problem" as long as he keeps his musical engagements.  We see Ray the womanizer who doesn't think it is a "problem" as long as it only happens on the road.  We see Ray the astute businessman who learns to accept his early cash payments in ones - so that he won't be underpaid - and later negotiates a recording deal "better than Sinatra's".  We see the Ray that understands that his music plays well in the south, and continues to play in venues that more progressive black musicians like Quincy Jones won't play.  We also see the Ray who finally understands the wrongness of segregated music halls and takes a stand that no musician before had made - resulting in him being banned from the big money state of Georgia.  We see the proud Ray who is invited back to the Capital of Georgia for an official apology.  (The film glosses over the fact that the Georgia legislature changed the official Georgia state song - not just to "Georgia on my Mind", but specifically to Mr. Charles' version.<br /><br />An excellent introduction to Ray Charles' life and music, highlighted by an Oscar caliber performance by Jamie Foxx as the Man himself.</p></body></html>

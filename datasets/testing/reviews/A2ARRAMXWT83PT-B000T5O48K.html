<meta name="summary" content="Another awesome play adaptation!"></head><body><p>For some reason, I love film adaptations of plays. The most effective ones involve two-four characters in one setting, such as WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF, TAPE, and OLEANNA. You can now add BUG to that list. Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, and Harry Connick Jr all deliver excellent performances in this film.<br /><br />From the title (and the way in which it was marketed) you would think that this would be another cheap, disgusting horror film. You would be wrong in making that assumption. It is a horrifying tale of paranoia, and how contagious it can be. If that does not seem unsettling to you at all, then go ahead and watch the film. It is quite disturbing.<br /><br />There are a few moments where the acting is a bit stagy, but that did not bother me much. It's a good thing to see actor's working to the best of their abilities, and this film delivers three fine examples of that. Some loved this film, others hated it. Yes, it's one of THOSE films, but I recommend that if you have not seen it, give it a try...especially if you're a theatre and/or film buff.</p></body></html>

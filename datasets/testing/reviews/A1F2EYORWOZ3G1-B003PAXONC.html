<meta name="summary" content="Really good movie"></head><body><p>I've read some of the other reviews here and disagree with a lot of them. I have never read the book and I saw the Vincent Price version of this movie when I was very young. So, I came to this version with basically a clean slate. And I liked it.<br />There are so many things I liked about it I don't know where to begin. The special effects were great, although a number of people dissed the CGI, I thought it worked well. The story follows a logical line for the situation, I liked that a lot too. Will Smith.... 'nuff said there.<br />The first half and the second half of the movie did, for me at least, fit together. In his travels one day, Will Smith notices one of his mannequins where he did not place it. He is distraught and investigates. While he is investigating, he's pulled into a trap similar to one he used on one of the vampires. As evening closes in, his watch beeps and wakes him up. A battle ensues between him, his dog and the 'night seekers'. During the battle he's rescued by a stranger who takes him to his home unaware that the 'night seekers' watched and now know where he and she are. They come back later that evening for the final confrontation.<br />So, there is a transition that takes place. It takes the movie from a peaceful but lonely route into a dangerous one. The vampires that Will Smith had been able to avoid can now locate him.<br />The moral and ethical implications this film stirs up are tremendous. Scientific experimentation to cure cancer seems to have been the cause of the transformation in this story. That in itself brings up endless wagers and exhaustive arguments over right and wrong. Will Smith's character states 'God didn't do this. We did.' Placing the blame for the destruction of mankind onto mankind in a way that's different from other similar movies.<br />Although this is not really a classic film, it is indeed a fine film and well worth watching. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or movies that can be debatable afterwards.</p></body></html>

Sure, relationships did develop and the characters changed but it was really a snooze.  Helen Hunt should not have won the Oscar for Best Actress that she stole from Kate Winslet.  Jack did deserve, but this definately was not his best performance of his career by any standard.  The movie wasn't bad, it was just OK.</p></body></html>

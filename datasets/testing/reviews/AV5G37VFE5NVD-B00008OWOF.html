It's the true-life story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a successful con artist who managed to escape numerous attempts at jailing him by an FBI agent (Tom Hanks), the only person who truly understands him.  Spielberg's directing is superb, making the film a very realistic one indeed; there's an extremely entertaining script by Jeff Nathanson; then there's a very fine score by John Williams.  To add to that, there are also great performances from DiCaprio (in one of his few very likable roles) and, of course, Hanks, along with Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, and Christopher Walken.  It may not rank among Spielberg's greatest films, but CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is surely one of his most entertaining.</p></body></html>

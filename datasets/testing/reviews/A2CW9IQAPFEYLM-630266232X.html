<meta name="summary" content=""A dame in Washington Heights got a fox fur out of me.""></head><body><p>Dana Andrews is the detective Mark McPherson who falls in love with the portrait of the beautiful Laura Hunt (played by Gene Tierney), apparent victim of a homicide - only halfway through the picture she comes walking in very much alive. Someone else had been killed, of course, and McPherson has three suspects: Laura herself; Shelby Carpenter, the man she was thinking of marrying (played by Vincent Price); and Waldo Lydecker, an oily, conceited jealous coot played wonderfully by Clifton Webb. After rounds of questioning, etc., the finger points to Waldo.<br /><br />The story is excellent and very tight, but that's not what makes this film noir so special. Great dialogue, wonderful atmosphere, and the constant use of the haunting theme music do. Only one punch is thrown in the whole picture, a mild one at that, which is almost unique to the genre. Tierney is beautiful with her pouty mouth, and nobody except maybe Bogart wore a fedora as well as Andrews. There were production problems galore with this movie, but none of them shows in the final product. A great, sophisticated murder mystery.</p></body></html>

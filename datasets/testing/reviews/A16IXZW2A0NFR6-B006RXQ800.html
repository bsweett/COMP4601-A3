Dicaprio and Diaz however are laughably bad in this, and the movie is meandering and often seems lost in it's own murk. I would only reccomend this to Day Lewis fans, Scorsese fans should skip it because it doesn't add anything to what he has done, this one is kind of an embarassment. Scorsese has had his great films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, that's why I've been confused with his recent stuff, The Aviator wasn't that great either. My advice is simple...Dicaprio, DeNiro you are not.</p></body></html>

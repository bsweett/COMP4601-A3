Honestly I think Brad Bird must be a magician to have crafted something so beautiful and subtlely complex.  I am in awe of this Pixar creation.  Best film they have done so far by a longshot.  Everything about it is perfection.  Can't say enough good things about it except to say anyone who says Shrek is better than this needs to get a life and a brain.  It is also in my opinion better than most of the superhero films we have (i.e. xmen, spiderman etc...)See this film if you want to remember what it feels like to be truly entertained by a moviegoing experience.</p></body></html>

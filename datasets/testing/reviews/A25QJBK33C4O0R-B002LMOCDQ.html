<meta name="summary" content="As a musical, it's a'iiiight"></head><body><p>I like musicals.  There I've said it.  Someone will surely come by and take my 'man' card for having said so, but I don't care.  I'm man enough to admit that I actually enjoy musicals.  At least in most cases I do.  With Mamma Mia!, at least the movie version (as found on Blu-ray and DVD), well, not so much.<br /><br />Mamma Mia! has been 'a worldwide phenomenon' for as long as I can remember... going back to TV ads blaring for the broadway type show.  Not quite as far back as the days when the band that the music came from was making music, but still for quite a long time.  Inspired by the music of ABBA (sorry, I can't make the backwards B character there), Mamma Mia! uses many of those songs to provide the sound track and even dialogue for a story about a daughter that is getting married, from a single mother who isn't sure which of 3 men fathered that daughter during a magical year many years ago.<br /><br />As a story Mamma Mia! is entertaining enough, and the actors in the film actually do well with their roles except.... well, except for the fact that they have to sing and need to be convincing enough to not have viewers feeling that they're watching a bunch of lip syncing.  It is in this area that Mamma Mia! fails for me, thanks to singing that seems out of sync with the songs that I remember, and worse, thanks to singing from an actor or two that were cast in the film who frankly shouldn't be allowed to sing at all.<br /><br />As a singer, lets just say that Pierce Brosnan shouldn't consider changing his line of work.  It may not be totally horrible, but it's enough to make you wish that Brosnan was busy working on a Bond film or something similar.<br /><br />Meryl Streep does ok with her vocal stylings, but again the pace of some of the singing she does just seems completely off when compared to the radio played songs that they were taken from.<br /><br />Watch this if you feel inspired to, but think carefully before purchase.  For as much 'fun' as this is supposed to be, you may find yourself regretting a purchase and wishing you rented instead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fairly enjoyable"></head><body><p>For me, this was one of these films that's enjoyable the first time - and that's it. I'm not sure what the creators of this film were thinking when they came up with the idea of a hot tub as a time machine, but this movie failed in some parts. I can appreciate the time travel aspect and trying to fix one's past, but there were way too many stupid and lowbrow jokes in this film to make it truly memorable. If you like any of the starring actors in this film, you might enjoy watching it. But this is a film better for renting, not buying.<br /><br />The ending was decent - one of the better parts of this film, that's for sure. If more thought had gone into this film, it would have been a more memorable one.</p></body></html>

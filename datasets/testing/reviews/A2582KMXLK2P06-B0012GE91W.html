<meta name="summary" content="potter finale"></head><body><p>The final chapter of the Harry Potter movies was delightful, imaginative, adventurous and magical.  More importantly it left us feeling satisfied with a great and proper ending.  While Harry Potter was growing and getting older, his films continued to give us the proper enjoyment we were craving since the first movie.  Over the years, we learned more about the story and the movie creators never failed to give each and every movie the right amount of detail, and they gave us the ability to give us more juicy storyline bits with each new film.</p></body></html>

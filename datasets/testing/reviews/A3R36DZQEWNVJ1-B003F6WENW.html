<meta name="summary" content="Wedding Crashers is hilarious....the best comedy so far this year"></head><body><p>Vince Vaughn (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Be Cool) plays Jeremy and Owen Wilson (Starsky & Hutch, Life Aquatic) plays John. The two of them are Wedding Crashers and they go to any wedding, be it a Jewish wedding and so forth and they go there to pick up women and sleep with them. The boys take a preticular wedding as they crash the wedding of big shot Christopher Walken (upcoming Domino, The Prophecy). There, Wilson meets Claire, played by Rachel McAdams (Red Eye, Mean Girls) and falls madly in love with her but the only thing is, is that she is engaged to pompous jackass played by Bradley Cooper (Tv's ALIAS) and on the other line, Vaughn gets involved with McAdams sister who is a real horn dog. Very funny...the Wedding Collage where Owen and Vince go to all those weddings I thought was funny....the two of them make a great comedy team...the comedy team of this era, just like Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and all those guys did back in the 80's...these guys are doing it now. Also starring Jane Seymour (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Live and Let Die)....hm, when Seymour was seducing Wilson in that one scene where she forces him to touch her breasts I was like, Dr. Quinn was doing a Mrs. Robinson. Will Ferrell (Melinda and Melinda, Bewitched) appears because he's part of the clan, Wilson and Vaughn are in, in which they appear in a lot of the same movies<br /><br /> (Zoolander, Royal Tenenbaums, Anchorman, Dodgeball, Old School)<br /><br />"Mom, Meatloaf!!" This is probably the funniest movie so far this year. Wilson and Vaughn score again.</p></body></html>

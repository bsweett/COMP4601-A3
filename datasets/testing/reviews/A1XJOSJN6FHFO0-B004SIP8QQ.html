<meta name="summary" content="Is Revenge Sweet?"></head><body><p>After seeing the first movie, of course I had to see the second. I was somewhat apprehensive since I didn't want to see all that blood and killing again, but I had to know what happened.  Actually, I was surprised at this one. This movie brought everything together, answered so many questions and actually had a pretty good ending. Yes, of course there was killing in it, but it also showed clearly the reason behind them.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if it was a happy ending or not and I have a feeling somehow this movie will have a part three.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson</p></body></html>

I mean, I am not a vampire aficionado by any means, but I have seen a few of the more well regarded vampire films and this one blows them all away for me.  There is just such raw and sinister relevance to this poignant story that I can't help but hold it in high esteem.<br /><br />I really, really need to read this novel!<br /><br />The film tells the story of a young boy named Oskar who meets a young vampire named Eli.  Oskar isn't aware right off that Eli is a vampire, but they bond due to a mutual feeling of exclusion.  Eli, being a vampire, is reclusive almost impulsively and has no real companions outside of a man named Hakan who takes care of her by killing men and bringing her blood.  Oskar is a small and wimpy young boy who is constantly picked on and finds himself internalizing his rage in wild fantasies of killing the boy who is harassing him.  That is how Eli and Oskar meet.  One night while acting out his frustrations on a defenseless tree, Oskar is approached by Eli and they soon strike up an unlikely friendship.  This relationship takes them through mutual hardships and helps the other to grow in areas they are struggling.<br /><br />This is very much a love story that is far less about love and more about affection.<br /><br />When one dissects the core of this film they find so much more than they bargained for, or than they initial thought they'd discover.  This is far more than just a monster movie, this is a beautiful depiction of adolescent angst and the need to find someone to share in and thus alleviate your pain.  There is also a lot here that is so subtle and merely hinted at.  I have read on some of the novel's broader scope and I love they way that this film insinuates a lot while leaving the majority of the back-story to your imagination.  Eli is a mysterious character, but there are plenty of hints to her story dropped for us to nibble on.  These tidbits add to the layers of pain in her eyes and the emotional depth we see in her undead soul.<br /><br />"If I wasn't a girl...would you like me anyway?"<br /><br />The subject of revenge and childhood alienation and subsequent domination is given proper and enlightening treatment as we consider Oskar's situation as well as the similar yet contrasted state that Eli finds herself.  Eli is very much like Oskar, yet she is a matured variation of him (beings that she is 200+ years old) and yet she maintains the same need for vengeance that he feels at his young age.  This detail tragically shows that pain etched on the skin of the young very rarely fades with time.  Oskar's undeniable desire to be older himself (he knows his age to the day, which is a tell tale sign of someone counting the days until something better) is also a tragic detail, showing the loss of youth in today's society.  With all the pain and all the heartache, our young ones are chucking away what should be crucial years of their development for adulthood.<br /><br />The title of the film alone (English translation being `Let the Right One In') is a testament to the level of emotional relevance this film carries.  The title refers to the emotional bond between Eli and Oskar, a statement referring to letting one in emotionally.  Throughout the film Eli makes it known that she must be invited inside, and this is metaphoric for the need she has to belong and or be wanted.  The same is true for Oskar, and once Eli begins to share her truth with Oskar it becomes apparent that she has `let him in' just as he has `let her in'.<br /><br />Carrying the film's heavy themes, young Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson (both making acting debuts here) are astonishingly effective.  It doesn't hurt that director Tomas Alfredson baths them in a sea of rich metaphoric light.  Alfredson allows his actors to become one with the imagery, creating a beautifully complete film.  The attention to detail is simply breathtaking.  From the score to the cinematography to the script to the acting, everything is a perfect compliment of the other.<br /><br />This film is truly haunting, but not in that generic horror way.  `Lat den Ratte Komma In' is far from generic.  It is intoxicatingly real, a film that shies away from the clich&eacute;s presented in this overdone genre (the characters are real and gritty as apposed to sexed up and artificial), giving us something with a purity rarely seen in a film containing this much bloodshed.</p></body></html>

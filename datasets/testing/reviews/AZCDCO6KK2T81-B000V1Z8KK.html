<meta name="summary" content="Shooter hits it's mark."></head><body><p>Okay, the mark isn't very high, but this film still delivers what one expects from an action/conspiracy film.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**  I don't think I give anything away that Amazon and others haven't already, or even the DVD box itself, but I'd rather play it safe in the event I do give away more than one might like.<br /><br />Amazon's review is accurate and to the point, so I won't belabor all the points of the plot here.  Here is what works in this flick: Mark Wahlberg is wholly believable in this role that bares some resemblance to Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and Danny Glover of the "Lethal Weapon" franchise fame makes a great villain along with Ned Beatty as a crooked senator.  Michael Pena is cast perfectly as the FBI agent who sees more to the story than he's getting from his bosses.  In addition, the direction is fast-paced and professional by the man who brought us Denzel Washington's Oscar performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKED">Training Day</a>.  The action is exciting and fun as these kinds of films are expected to have.<br /><br />What doesn't work too well:  The plot, which takes considerable "suspension of disbelief", goes down smoothly enough, but has holes you can drive a truck through.  Wahlberg's girlfriend in the film is totally unbelievable, completely miscast, and poorly written.  We are expected to believe that a girl who never saw a day of violence in her life can just pick up a shotgun and shoot a man to death while never blinking an eye.  She even does so in her underwear.  I think it's safe to say she is nothing more than eye-candy.<br /><br />Okay, now why 4 stars and claiming it "hits it's mark" then, Steve?  Well, it isn't aiming very high.  It's a generally well-acted and executed action flick and should be judged as such.  It isn't out to save the world, make a statement, enlighten us in any manner, and nor is it looking for Oscar nominations.  It's simple popcorn fun.</p></body></html>

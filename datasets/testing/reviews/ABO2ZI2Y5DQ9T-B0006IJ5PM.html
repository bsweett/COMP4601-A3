<meta name="summary" content="High School Football, or American Way of Life"></head><body><p>Five years after "Varsity Blues," another film about West Texas high school football comes with Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines who must lead his team to the championship, no matter what it takes.  Based on the real games and the real people, who participated in the 1988 season, 'Friday Night Lights' is more authentic and often alarmingly realistic than 'Varsity Blues' (which I like), in describing the glory of being the star players, and revealing the reality surrounding them.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg (The Rock's successful 'The Rundown'), perhaps inevitably, spends most of the films on the life on and out of the field of the high school players -- THE star of the team 'Booobie' (Derek Luke), team leader Mike (Lucas Black), and Charles (Tim McGraw) whose abusive father keeps on telling how he is disappointed with his son.  So far, things are not new.  If you think one of them is too confident, you already know what will happen to him.<br /><br />To see the life of Coach Gaines, with good acting from Billy Bob Thornton, is more intersting to me, for his life in the city of Odessa, Texas, could be very intense, nearly life-or-death matter.  The townspeople come to the Coach, and then, quietly tell him that their team must win -- if not directly, with uninvited suggestions.  And as far as the football goes, when they wish something, that something must be realized.  Like winning the State.<br /><br />[CONVENTIONAL BUT SOLID] Despite the semi-documentray touch of the slightly shaky and grainy photography, the film is made with an orthodox approach.  At first the film has some moments showing the players' doubts about their way of life, or even the way of the football itself (and the community that suppport with enthusiasm), but gradually the heroism takes them over, with the exciting scenes of the bone-crunching games and dedicated football players.  The story is very conventional, but the presentation is solid and well-paced.<br /><br />Like his previous 'The Rundown,' Peter Berg conducts everything with confidence, and the results are very satisfactory even though you don't particularly like the world of American high school football.  Even if you don't come to like the sports itself, you come to understand the people in this small town where the Friday Night Lights mean everything to them, the glory, the life and all.</p></body></html>

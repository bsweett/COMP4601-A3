<meta name="summary" content="Faith versus proof"></head><body><p>Religion is built on faith. By definition, it must be, for it cannot prove its claims and most of what we know about science refutes most of what's said by religion.<br /><br />It is using faith that Sister Alloyicious (Meryl Streep), bases her entire case against a charasmatic new priest (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He's the embodiment of Vatican 2, and she's... well, probably Mel Gibson's grandmother.<br /><br />The priest is doing things like giving sermons in English, that talk about peace, compassion and tolerace. He's taking sugar in his tea. He's even using a ballpoint pen! His ideas and his way of doing things are vastly different from those of the good Sister, so she's willing to believe, on the slightest, flimsiest theory, that the priest is molesting one of the boys in his care.<br /><br />It's fascinating to watch as she builds up this case in her own mind, eager to believe it is true. She talks with the priest, with the boy's mother (who is, btw, one of the most pragmatic characters I've ever seen on screen), with another nun, with just about everyone, and though everyone defends the priest against her, she refuses to listen, cause she has certainty. She has faith. She has no doubt.<br /><br />The character studies here are fascinating, as are the contrasts in this very important time of the Church's life, as is the rush to judgement and the power of rumor. Merely by raising the suspicion in people's minds that this priest may be molesting a child, she makes it real, no matter if it is or isn't.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and one I'd highly recommend. See what can happen when faith takes the place of rational thought.</p></body></html>

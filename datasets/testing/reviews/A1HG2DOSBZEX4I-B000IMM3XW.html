<meta name="summary" content="Great Beginning To the Series"></head><body><p>Bryan Singer has created a great opening to the X-Men movie franchise. The key to this type of film is not to play it too comic bookish and also not to play it too seriously. Singer does a good job on both counts. With great casting and a quickly moving plot line the X-Men movie is a pleasure to watch and as Singer puts it in his commentary a good trailer for the next movie in the series.<br /><br />There are many characters in the X-Men universe but the film wisely introduces the viewer to a small group of them who will be essential to the story. In the America of the not too distant future a debate rages as to whether mutants (those with special powers) should be made to register with the government. To Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) this is just too close to his childhood which was spent in a Polish concentration camp. He has gathered his Brotherhood of Mutants in order to battle this registration scheme. He intends to use a special radiation emitting device which will turn all into mutants. His group includes Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) the Toad (Ray Park) and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn).<br /><br />Opposing the Brotherhood's Plans id Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who believes in a peaceful existence between mutants and the humans. He runs a school for mutant children that preaches inclusion rather than fear and exclusion. His star students who teach at his Academy have not rejoined the world. They are the X-Men. The X-Men that are featured are the weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry), the lasar eyed Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Into his group comes a teen who cannot touch others, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and a man who has been equipped with claw like weapons named Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).<br /><br />To give away more of the story would ruin the fun. This is the best type of action movie both intelligent and quick moving. One can only hope that future movies in the series will follow the same outline. I viewed this film in the special two-disc edition that includes the director commentary, an extended viewing mode with 17 incorporated branching featurettes and a number of special features introduced by Singer on a second disc.<br /><br />Of the many comic book movies released in the last few years this is one of the best that I've seen. See it and enjoy.</p></body></html>

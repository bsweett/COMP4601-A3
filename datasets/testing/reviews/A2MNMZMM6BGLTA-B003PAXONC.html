<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good"></head><body><p>I am not a big Will Smith fan but I must say I thought this movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the action and the concept (and yes I saw it already in Omega Man with Charlton Heston). The movie was well done and the CGI was pretty good. I liked the build up to the zombies and also the flashbacks weren't too annoying. Also loved the man dog friendship and how it was portrayed.</p></body></html>

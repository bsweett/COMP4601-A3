They have been suckered in by so many pretentious 'art' films these days, why can't an ordinary horror film be included in their pantheon? The critics' level of self-deception is so high on this film that there were zero negative reviews, only one mixed and 29 positive reviews on Metacritic (the mixed one was by Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly; unfortunately, it's only a capsule blurb).<br /><br />For the majority of internet posters with dissenting opinions, their main objection was that the film was too slow-paced to be worthwhile. There are plenty of films that are slow-paced but they still hit the mark, so to criticize the film merely on the grounds that it's tedious, misses the point as to why 'The Right One' is so reprehensible.<br /><br />It begins in a Stockholm suburb and it looks like this is going to be another tired serial killer retread. The killer (Hakan) has slit the throat of a young man walking in a park, hangs him upside down, dangling from a tree, and then attempts to collect the blood into a gasoline can as it drips from the victim's neck. Soon, however, we learn that Hakan is actually a vampire (or rather an assistant to a vampire who appears to be 12 years old). The 12 year old 'female', named Eli, actually has been alive since the middle ages (the book that the film is based on includes more graphic details on Eli's origins--that she, rather he, was castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman).<br /><br />Some critics (such as Roger Ebert) became enamored with the relationship angle between Oskar, the lonely 12 year old protagonist, and his new found vampire friend. Oskar already has a fascination with crime to begin with, cutting out articles from the local newspapers detailing sordid murders occurring in nearby localities. While Oskar seems to have a nose for crime, the local police in 'Let the Right One In" seem to be oddly absent during the investigation into the killings initiated by Hakan and his juvenile master, Eli.<br /><br />One wonders why Eli suddenly takes a liking to little Oskar since she has no guilt feelings about draining the blood out of various other upstanding members of the community. Since those community members all seem to depicted as a bunch of louts or buffoons, I guess it's okay that Hakan and Eli can do whatever they want to them with impunity. Eli further displays her 'sensitive side' when she advises Oskar to strike back at the local bullies who have been harassing him.<br /><br />There are very few films that will feature a murderous monster who is depicted as not being so bad after all. Somehow it doesn't bother Oskar that his gal pal goes around dispatching whoever she feels like it. Not only is Oskar's acquiescence condoned, but the film's scenarists have no guilt feelings about promoting the idea that it's good for a 12 year old to take the law into his own hands. Even worse is the idea that it's okay for a boy who's been bullied, to take revenge, acting just as sadistically as his tormentors did toward him (Recall how Oskar takes delight in whipping the school bully across the face with a pole).<br /><br />I suppose the reason why Eli is supposed to get a free pass here is because somehow she can't help herself (after all, she got bitten back in the Middle Ages). The moral of the story is that you can commit all the horrific murders you want but as long as you counsel a 12 year old boy as to the proper etiquette in dealing with a group of stick figure, cardboard cut out bullies, then you can continue traipsing around Scandinavia, committing additional atrocious crimes.<br /><br />As for those of you still looking for true scenes of horror, 'The Right One' offers only slim pickings. In addition to the aforementioned opening scene where Hakan does his blood draining bit, you also get (hold on to your seats!): Eli (channeling Spiderman) scurrying up the side of a hospital building, Hakan disfiguring himself by pouring hydrochloric acid over his face, in order to escape being identified by the police and Eli returning to rip off the heads and arms of the school bullies who are about to make mince meat of Oskar at the school swimming pool.<br /><br />Nothing really makes sense in 'Let the Right Thing In' including the blood sucking vampires and morally challenged 12 year olds. One can't really blame John Lindqvist, author of the book the film was based on, as well as its screenwriter, for the ultimate successful promotion of this claptrap. That honor goes to the film critics, always seeking their next great 'work of art' along with the teenage audience that went to the movie theaters in droves and (unfortunately) bought all those tickets.</p></body></html>

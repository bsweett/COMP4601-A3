In Odessa, Texas, the Permian Panthers, the high school football team, reign supreme over the town.  Players are treated like celebrities, and every Friday night is like the Super Bowl for the citizens of Odessa.  Because this is the only team they have, Odessa places incredible pressure on the Panthers to win the State Football Championship.  Things are no different in the 1988 season as Coach Gary Gaines hopes to lead the Panthers to victory.  When the team's star running back goes down with a serious knee injury, it looks like their season is in trouble.  This movie, directed by Peter Berg, shows very accurately just how important the football team is to Odessa.  Incredible amounts of pressure are placed on Coach Gaines and his players to win.  A season that does not end in a State Championship is a failure.  Highly recommended sports movie.<br /><br />  Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Coach Gary Gaines, who must lead his Panthers to the State Championships or else.  This has been quite a year for Thornton who also gave great performances in The Alamo and Bad Santa.  The movie focuses on six players on the team who all give very good, believable performances; Lucas Black as quarterback Mike Winchell, who wants to get out of Odessa but at the same time must support his mother, Garret Hedlund as fullback Don Billingsley, who must live under the watchful eye of his alcoholic father, Derek Luke as tailback James "Boobie" Miles, the cocky, extremely gifted star of the team, Jay Hernandez as free safety Brian Chavez, the gifted student, Lee Jackson as the strong, silent defensive lineman Ivory Christian, and Lee Thompson Young as Chris Comer, the small third string running back.  Tim McGraw is almost unrecognizable in his excellent performance as Charles Billingsley, Don's alcoholic father.  The movie also stars Connie Britton, Grover Coulson, and Connie Cooper.  For a great high school football movie with an excellent cast and a great story based on the 1988 season of the Odessa-Permian Panthers, check out Friday Night Lights!</p></body></html>

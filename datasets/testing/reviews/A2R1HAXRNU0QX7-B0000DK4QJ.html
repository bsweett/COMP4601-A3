Yes, just about any film that explores time, time travel, the future, etc. is going to have flaws in logic.  It is impossible to travel through time, change the future, etc.  If you think about it too much, you can always come up with a flaw.  If the flaws require deep thought and don't just leap at you as obvious, I have no problem suspending my disbelief and going with where the storyteller wants to take me.<p>Spielberg tells a great story here. I won't rehash the plot, but let's just say that not only is the story a zinger, but there are lots of great scenes.  My favorite was the scene when Cruise is hiding out in a VERY sleazy apartment, waiting for his transplanted eyes to heal, and the cops release these electronic "spiders" that can get into just about any place and then they find people and scan their retinas.  The sweeping camera work, as though the whole complex had been cut into a cross section, was absolutely terrific.  In about two minutes, we get the entire social / political climate that now exists in this country at the time of the movie, at least for the poor.  And it is suspenseful.<p>The empaths are very creep creations, lying in their pool forever and ever. When Cruise awakens and steals one of them, the movie takes a very interesting turn, as we see the world through the eyes of this empath, Agatha, who has a hard time telling if what she is seeing is the present or the future.  Samantha Morton plays her, and she DESERVES AN OSCAR NOMINATION, ASAP!  She is reviting.<p>Colin Farrell makes for a cool adversary for the hot-tempered Cruise.  Max VonSydow is terrific as Cruise's mentor...he has such a great voice.  And Cruise, who has never been one of my favorite actors, is very good in this...one of his best.  He keeps himself from overacting in most scenes, and doesn't seem too self-conscious about looking good or charming.  <p>The whole vision of a not too distant future, coupled with some great scenes of suspense, good performances and even a tear-jerking moment or two make this one of the best movies of the year, and certainly the best sci-fi of the year.  I highly recommend it!</p></body></html>

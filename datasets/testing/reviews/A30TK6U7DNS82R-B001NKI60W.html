Just about, though everything else carries with it the least little hint of could have been better.  When they announced the movie and said that Olivia Newton John might be playing Donna, we all cheered, and then when it seemed like Michelle Pfeiffer was getting the nod, we were even happier.  Frankly, Meryl Streep gets everything nowadays, can't they give it to someone whose career could use the boost?  But she can sing and of course she can act up a storm.  Donna never seems to think twice about what she is going to the Greek coastline with her enormous tourist hotel and employing all the Greek islanders as her gofers.  How does she pay any of them I wonder, if the business is as bad as she claims?<br /><br />How did Amanda Seyfried get to meet those two bridesmaids who seem to have wandered in from a movie like BLOW-UP--tall, leggy, older supermodels indistinguishable from each other, not a single personality between them.  They just make Sophie look like a midget, can she really be that short?  I used to like Seyfried, but her goofy swoons every time her mother sings are too forced.  I like exuberance, but hers is cooked up like heroin sizzling in a spoon.  And yet, she's not awful, and in fact she does a pretty good job convincing us that she really wants to find out who her father is.  This must speak to a lot of people who don't know their fathers, I guess, but for the rest of us, it is not motivation enough--it is the opposite of motivation--countermotivation perhaps.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic what's his name have chemistry during their big number Lay All Your Love on Me, possibly ABBA's sexiest tune, but otherwise I'm looking at him wondering what the big deal is.  A star of tomorrow, I don't think so.<br /><br />What a missed opportunity for Meryl Streep to have introduced Abba's "JUST LIKE THAT" to the world.  ABBA fans know that "MAMMA MIA" the stage musical actually had a "Just Like That" scene which was trimmed during out of town tryouts.  Here she does a fine job with "The Winner Takes It All," but no one can actually perform that one better than the original by Agnetha Faltskog... maybe Meryl Streep is too levelheaded a person really to put that song over.  Is she ever really down, or does she find a little bit of hope even in her darkest hour?  With Agnetha we knew that everything in the universe was and is and remains doomed, for the gods, cold as ice, throw a dice and decide our fate.</p></body></html>

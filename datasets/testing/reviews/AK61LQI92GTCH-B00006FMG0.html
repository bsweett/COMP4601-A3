<meta name="summary" content="Road to Perdition"></head><body><p>Wow, is THE ROAD TO PERDITION a slow moving movie.  Deliberate, ponderous, lugubrious.  Take your pick, this is one slow flick.<br /> It's 1931 and Tom Hanks plays Chicago hit-man Mike Sullivan, The Angel of Death, and surrogate son to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman.)  When Sullivan's son Mike Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) observes his father and Rooney's son Connor (Daniel Craig) bump off a clutch of gangsters everything changes.  Connor, motivated by a mixture of sibling jealousy and a need to keep the killings a secret, decides to wipe out the Sullivan family.  He succeeds in murdering Sullivan's wife and youngest son, but misses Mike and Mike Jr.  The surviving Sullivans escape and embark on a journey of revenge and survival.<br /> THE ROAD TO PERDITION was taken from an illustrated novel, and I understand the filmmakers responsibility to the source material, but I would have dropped the kid and abandoned the notion of telling the story of the son's point of view.  At this point in Hanks' career it's difficult enough to accept him as a physically imposing, inarticulate brute.  Viewing him through the eyes of his emotionally distant son doesn't help.  Hanks is an incredible actor, but he's also a movie star cast against type in this one.  The story doesn't allow him the opportunity to convince us of his character.<br />  It looks great.  Cinematographer Conrad Hall is a genius, especially when it comes to filming rain.  The sets are gorgeous, the feeling of depression-era America is well captured.  Unfortunately the movie takes forever to sprout wings, and even then it doesn't fly.  The wonderful Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely seen and largely wasted as Sullivan's wife.  There's are whole scenes that go nowhere in particular (the wake scene, for instance) and seem intended to do nothing more than establish atmosphere.<br /> I could go on, but I'll simply say that considering the talent involved this was a big disappointment.</p></body></html>

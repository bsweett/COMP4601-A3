Saw some commercials for it here and there, but I wasn't sure if it was something that I had to see right away.  It wasn't until I went to a store and saw that this was directed by none other than the brilliant Christopher Nolan (who directed my all-time favorite movie, "Memento").  That's all it took for me to buy the DVD without even really knowing what the movie was about.  I didn't care.  It had Nolan's name on it, and that's all I needed.  I watched it the next day and couldn't believe how great this movie was.  Not only that, but I ended up watching it again only a few hours after my first viewing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are so many twists and turns in this wild ride that I'll have to be brief in describing what it's about so I don't end up giving away something crucial (yeah, it's one of those where you give away one little thing, and it could possibly ruin the movie for the other person).  As simplistic as I can put it the film concerns two magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.  The two were quite the team and worked together splendidly until one night one of their well known tricks goes wrong and ends up costing Angier a loved one.  He blames Borden for his loss and becomes obsessed with finding any means to out-show him, learn his secrets and destroy him.<br /><br />I know, this sounds like a typical "thriller," but that's really only a small outline of the movie.  I had to keep it short and simple to avoid giving away too much.  "The Prestige" works more as a drama/thriller/mystery.  The entire theme of the movie is to "watch closely," and there's reason for that.  You're not entirely sure what is going on until the very end, and even then you feel like you have to watch it again right away to verify what you've just witnessed.  Nolan's great at playing head-games with you, and it's nice to see him dive intos that area of film again.  Even though you're always trying to piece together what's going on, none of that takes away the enjoyment of watching these characters and how they interact in the environment around them.  The look and feel of the film is very dark, but it looks so gorgeous.<br /><br />The performances from Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine are perfect.  Bale never ceases to amaze me in the roles he takes, as he commits himself a hundred percent every time.  David Bowie even makes a small appearance in the film, and trust me when I say this, you do not see him as David Bowie on the screen.  You buy into his character completely.<br /><br />It must be said, even though this is a PG-13 movie, it gets pretty disturbing and the overall tone of the movie is dark and cold.  I wouldn't recommend it for children.  The DVD doesn't offer a whole lot of features, which is a shame because I have the suspicion that they will re-release it in a "fully-loaded" edition later on (which I will have to go and buy).<br /><br />"The Prestige" is a total success, and then some.  It's one of those movies that you have to watch more than once, and each time you see it (just like with "Memento"), chances are you're going to pick up on something that you didn't see the first time around.  If you're looking for something different and unique, I strongly suggest giving this a try.  It ranks up there as one of my top favorites of 2006.  Nice to see that Christopher Nolan has made another fantastic movie and has proven that he's not just a one-trick pony.  The movie may have a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested, but they never take away from the great story and characters.<br /><br />Are you watching closely?  -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

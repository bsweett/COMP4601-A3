While watching this movie at the local $2 theatre, the answer came to me: Design by committee. A bunch of Hollywood execs got together to create this movie. Why else would they cast Jessica Alba as Sue Richards?<br /><br />This also explains why Doctor Doom looks like a big green, corny dialog spewing Van Der Graf generator.<br /><br />Fantastic Four was supposed to be this big blockbuster but hype can only carry a movie so far. If the makers of this loud movie bothered to pick up and read one FF comic, I think that the movie would have been alot better.</p></body></html>

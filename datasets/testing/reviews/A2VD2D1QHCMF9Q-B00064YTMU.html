<meta name="summary" content="Ridiculous!"></head><body><p>Tom Cruise was very interesting to watch in a real bad guy role, but the movie just didn't keep up with him.  The chance occurrence regarding two random fares in a taxi winding up having very much to do with each other is ridiculous.  Having the taxi driver pretend to be a hit man and getting away with it was another incident that left credibility behind, as well as the insertion of the mother into the film.  This film was an excuse to portray Tom Cruise in a particularly nasty role, but that was just not enough of a reason to sit through it, at least not for me . .</p></body></html>

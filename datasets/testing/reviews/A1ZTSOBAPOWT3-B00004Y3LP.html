Too bad they couldn't do something more resourceful by finding cures to diseases. Man! Oh well, the most brilliant people in the country flock to Jurassic Park to be the first to walk through the park. Everything seems fine and dandy at first, but a big, fat jerk tries to steal D.N.A. samples to sell it to a smuggler. He ruins everything because he's not in shape and the dinosaurs break out of their quadrants. A Tyrannosaurus Rex eats a guy off of a toilet, chases a speeding jeep, and then eats other dinosaurs/animals. What's the matter kid? You don't like lamb chops? Little Timmy is smarter than the adults. Alan Grant doesn't like children, I can see why. Ian Malcolm talks funny and he looks like my friend. Too bad they didn't use Arnold Schwarzenegger to save the day. Can you imagine? However, Steven Spielberg did a fine job of directing and fans won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

I haven't felt this visceral since the first movie, it's that impressive and Sly looks great at Sixty. Once again John Rambo is fighting injustice, this time in Myanmar (previously Burma). Apparently since we last saw Rambo he has spent years in Thailand and Myanmar catching snakes and miscellaneous other jobs to get by. When Rambo takes a church group up river to give medical aid and Christian teaching to people suffering the religious cleansing he feels they won't make a difference and he leaves. The village and the group is later ambushed by soldiers. Most the village is killed but several in the Church group survive. Rambo finds out and feels he must return to rescue them.<br /><br />The problem is a mercenary group has been sent in to extract them and they don't want Rambo's company past the point on the river he dropped off the Church group. Once again John won't take no for an answer and after he polishes off a few enemies with his trusty bow they are happy to have him. John proceeds to blow enemy soldiers up with Claymores and anything else he can get his hands on. When he gets his hands on a .50 caliber machine gun he cuts them to pieces literally. The effects and stunt people did a masterful job of making it look realistic. So be prepared for some major carnage that shouldn't be seen by younger viewers. One slight complaint is I would have liked it a little longer to develop the characters just slightly more, not to mention I didn't want it to end so quickly. I still think the first movie is the best in the series because of the story and characters, but this one is probably second because of how well it shows real events with realistic effects. Good quality DVD with reasonable replayability. If you enjoyed this catch the other "Rambo" movies or "Ruckus" for a lighter take on this story that came out pre-Rambo First Blood. - C.

Also, some of the original crew from the first two are back for the second sequel, as well. Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker / Spider-Man), Kirsten Dunst (as Mary-Jane Watson), and James Franco (as Harry Osborn / The New Goblin) are back and lead an incredible cast that includes Thomas Haden Church (as Flint Marko / Sandman), Topher Grace (as Eddie Brock / Venom), and Bryce Dallas Howard (as Gwen Stacy). The directing by Sam Raimi (who also directed the first two "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The screen story by Raimi and his brother Ivan & the screenplay by Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Alvin Sargent (who also wrote the screenplay to "Spider-Man 2" (2004) is great. The music by Christopher Young (who also did the music to a movie that was released as counter-programming to "Spider-Man 3" (2007), that movie is "Lucky You" (2007), which was directed by Tobey Maguire's "Wonder Boys" (2000) director Curtis Hanson) is great. The cinematography by Bill Pope (who also did the cinematography to "Spider-Man 2") is great. The film editing by Bob Murawski (who also film edited both "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The casting by Kathy Driscoll & Francine Maisler (who also did the casting to "Spider-Man" (2002) is great. The production design by J. Michael Riva & Neil Spisak (who also did the production design to both "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr, David F. Klassen, David Swayze, & Dawn Swiderski is great. The set decoration by Leslie A. Pope is great. The costume design by James Acheson (who also did the costume design to both "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The visual effects by Scott Stokdyk (who was also an visual effects supervisor to the last two "Spider-Man" movies) are impressive and should get an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. This is a great movie that ranks in between "Spider-Man 2" & "Spider-Man". This is thrilling, impressive, and smart.</p></body></html>

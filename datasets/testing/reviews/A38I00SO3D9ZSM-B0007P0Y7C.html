But, I  rented it as part of a two-for-one deal at my local videostore and was glad I did.<br /><br />Is Elektra a great movie?  No.  But it's good.  Make no mistake, Batman Begins was a better film all the way around, but Elektra had similar elements, particularly in the back stories (both heroes lost parents when they were young, both were trained in ninjitsu and other martial arts.)  Elektra was a bit darker, for lack of a better term, than other Marvel comics-turned films such as The Hulk, X-Men or The Fantastic Four.<br /><br />In essence, Elektra is a martial arts film.  It has many asian elements and themes.  While many comic book superheroes acquire their powers by mutation, radiation or some other technological disaster or circumstance, Elektra's powers are mystical and learned, giving the story an eastern, not western, flavor.<br /><br />The action sequences are well done.  The scenes are nicely shot.  Very little of what takes place is so unbelievable as to be silly or ridiculous.  Jennifer Garner brings much of Alias to this role but it works.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would buy this movie but it's worth a rental, especially if you like action/adventure films.</p></body></html>

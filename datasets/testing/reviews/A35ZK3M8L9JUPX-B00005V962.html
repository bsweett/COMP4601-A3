<meta name="summary" content="Ocean's Eleven (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Danny Ocean wants to score the biggest heist in history. He combines an eleven team member, including Frank Catton, Rusty Ryan and Linus Caldwell. Their target? The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. All casinos owned by Terry Benedict. It's not going to be easy, as they plan to get in secretly and out with $150 million. This is a movie that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking, that was really clever. Just sit back and enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Monroe is Magnetic"></head><body><p>It is no wonder Monroe is a legend and it is no wonder this movie remains a favorite. It is set in 1929 with clever lines in the beginning telling what is to come later in history like mentioning the stock market crash and the divorce of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. Marilyn is magnetic and sexy despite that fact that she was pregnant during the filming and heading toward her mental instabilities. This is probably her best film because it combines both her enormous appeal with a truly great script and supporting cast.<br /><br />This movie is lighthearted and innocent, with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dressing as women to run from the mob and falling for the beautiful blondes in the Sweet Sue all female band. They each instantly fall for Sugar, played by Monroe, but it is Curtis' character who dresses as a rich oil tycoon strangely similar to Cary Grant's screen persona, who wins her over.<br /><br />Don't miss this incredible film, one of the last of the golden age of Hollywood!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You Don't Have to Know the Comic to Enjoy This!"></head><body><p>While I love Superhero films (and am as knowledgeable about Superman, Batman, and most of the Marvel heroes as any comic book fan from the 'Silver Age'), I admit I was unfamiliar with Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' graphic novel "Watchmen", before watching the big screen version. I only knew that it was a different 'spin' on the 'Justice Society/Justice League' chronology, involving a unique set of heroes and an alternate version of our reality.<br /><br />"Watchmen", the movie, is much, much, more, and stands, with "The Dark Knight", as the most provocative, unconventional, and brilliant reinventions of the genre, since Tim Burton 'reinvented' Batman, in the eighties.<br /><br />First off, it debunks the classic superhero 'origin' story. These are not noble scientists or rich philanthropists, who don costumes to hide their indentities and achieve their 'higher calling'...many of this group were cops, who, when criminals discovered wearing masks and costumes made it impossible to identify and prosecute them, donned masks, themselves, to do what the courts couldn't: exact justice. Most of these 'costumed heroes' had no 'special skills' other than as brawlers, and the confrontations with masked criminals had more of a carnival sideshow 'feel' than anything really heroic. And these 'heroes', being regular people, had all the human foibles; some were sadists, one heroine was a lesbian, another would be raped, and all had some degree of ego problems. Yet the public loved them, and when, in the 40s, a group banded together, they achieved the same kind of public adoration as the Justice Society would, in their world. As time passed, however, age and changing mores would create a 'changing of the guard'...one hero, Nite Owl (a variation of Batman), would retire, replaced by a technology geek (Patrick Wilson), who added 'toys' large and small, to enhance his skills; another (Carla Gugino) would be replaced by her daughter (Malin Akerman); the world's richest, most brilliant intellectual (Matthew Goode) would use his resources to enhance his abilities and create a nearly superhuman persona; a child abuse victim (Jackie Earle Haley) would don a cowl with ever-changing patterns, and become a hard-core 'Dirty Harry'-type vigilante...and the world's first true 'superpowered' hero (Billy Crudup) would appear, a man who, when accidently bathed in nuclear energy, lost his physical form, becoming a nude blue creature of nearly limitless power, but a fading understanding of humanity. Joined by the one 'carry-over' from the first generation, the handsome, if disgusting 'Comedian' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a new team is created...which is really where the movie begins!<br /><br />It is 1985, a caricatured version of Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden), is in his umpteenth term as President, the world is at the brink of nuclear war, and the 'superheroes', with the exception of Crudup's 'Dr. Manhattan', have been ordered to retire, following a carnage-fueled American 'victory' of the Vietnam war. Other than Haley ('Rorschach'), who went into hiding, everyone has complied, willingly...but when the Comedian is brutally murdered, and other ex-heroes are targeted, Rorschach suspects a far more sinister purpose than simply revenge, and tries, unsuccessfully, to get his former colleagues to join him in a search for answers. He was right, of course, and as we learn more about the heroes' lives and backstories, a truly riveting tale of ambition, morality, and 'greater good' emerges, that kept me 'hooked'. While I saw elements of Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" on several occasions, I'd never seen a universe so carefully and logically 'fleshed out', onscreen, and it was simply stunning.<br /><br />I won't give away anything else about this remarkable film...only to recommend it, enthusiastically, if you love this kind of film as much as I do...You won't be disappointed!</p></body></html>

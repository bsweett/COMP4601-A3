<meta name="summary" content="Awesome.  But only for the second disc."></head><body><p>This is a fantastic film.  I don't know when it became cool to diss Spielberg and his movies but I see why it was included as the 24th greaest American movie on AFI's 10th Anniversary list.<br /><br />Such a powerful movie.  It works on so many levels and Henry Thomas gives a wonderful performance.<br /><br />But the first disc ruins the classic.  CGI takes away that realistic feel to movies.  No matter how wondeful the advancements are, there's something about CGI that ruins a classic when it's retouched in an unneeded way.<br /><br />E.T. did not need retouching.  It's a perfect film.  One of the best I've seen.</p></body></html>

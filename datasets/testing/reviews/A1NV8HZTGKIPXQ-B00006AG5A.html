If, by now, those people don't understand a fun 'popcorn' movie like this, they never will. However, I'm not praising The Mummy Returns. Not by a long shot. First of all, let's get into the story. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are now husband and wife with an 8 year old son. They are sort of a Mommy-Daddy Indiana Jones like adventurers. They find a magical bracelet once owned by The Scorpion King(played by The Rock, who shows the most charisma in a very brief role). He died 5,000 years ago, and is waiting to be brought back. The mummy Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo)is resurrected again(yes! again!), and kidnaps our heroes son who put the bracelet on. The bracelet shows where to go to find The Scorpion King, and then it goes into the usual mumbo jumbo about the end of the world!. Bet you didn't expect that. Okay, so maybe you did. There's so much going on in this film that the plot doesn't really matter. The action scenes are, of course, a lot of fun. The effects are good as always and, in some cases, better than in the original. Brendan Fraser is actually believeable in his role. Watch him in anything else and you would think differently. Rachel Weisz is a gorgeous beauty. I hope to see her and her loveliness in far better material in the future. John Hannah is also back as her annoying brother. This is pure cotton candy folks, and it isn't meant to be taken any other way. It's Indiana Jones light. These movies are pretty fun and harmless. There's nothing wrong with that. This one, however, could of been better. A part 3 is inevitable.</p></body></html>

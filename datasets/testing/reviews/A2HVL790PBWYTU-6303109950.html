Its theatrical release came six months on the heels of TOMBSTONE, which is hands down better and my favorite film featuring lawman Wyatt Earp. TOMBSTONE is not as contemplative as MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or HOUR OF THE GUN or GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, but its sheer bravado and energy kept my eyeballs glued to the screen. TOMBSTONE breathes thunder and swagger into an old western legend.<br /><br />Tombstone, Arizona in 1879, and the territory is lorded over by over 100 exiled Texas outlaws calling themselves the Cowboys, identified by their red sashes and led by Curly Bill Brocius and the fast-draw killer Johnny Ringo and numbering the Clantons in its roster. And then Wyatt Earp came to Tombstone, retired from his days as a Kansas peace officer and intent only on a fresh start as an entrepreneur with his brothers. Except that Wyatt Earp was never meant to go down in the history books as a businessman.<br /><br />Who knows how accurate this adaptation is? I don't know. Word is the first half of TOMBSTONE is more or less true to the real life account, is fairly faithful to what led up to the blood feud between the Earps and the Clanton gang, but that the second half deals in sprawling malarkey. All I know is that I'm always hugely entertained when I see this movie. History buffs of the Old West may beg to differ. I just like to see bullets fly with impunity.<br /><br />I am bowled over by the bristling machismo and attitude. If nothing else, TOMBSTONE pound for pound has to boast more aggressive facial hair than any other film in recent memory. Familiar faces dot this landscape, quite a bit of these actors being of the manly persuasion: Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton, and even Robert Mitchum drops by to do some narrative voice-over. But Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer carry this baby. Russell is bedrock solid as the centerpiece, playing Wyatt Earp with unrelenting intensity and boring holes with his icy stare. His brooding interpretation easily dismisses Kevin Costner's own take as inferior stuff. Russell's defining moment comes early when he braces the bullying faro dealer at the Oriental bar casino. "Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens," he ominously dares the bully, and we immediately know this cat is not to be effed with. The faro dealer is properly cowed, and keep in mind that this is Billy Bob Thornton playing the faro dealer.<br /><br />It's Kilmer, though, in his best role ever, who walks away with the universal plaudits. Val Kilmer is magnificent and magnificently sly in a performance that manages to simultaneously convey terminal sickliness and a detached, reckless flair. Doc Holliday, unrepentant sinner and cough-ridden, cuts a tragic figure, and yet he delivers the most memorable lines, cool customer that he is. I really don't know how many times I've quoted "I'm your huckleberry" or "You're no daisy" to friends, but I'm now pretty much hated for it. A marvelous bit of cinema surfaces when Doc Holliday and Johnny Ringo (a mad dog Michael Biehn) bait each other in Latin and then there's that inspired contest of braggadocio immediately following. No man could've ever struck down THIS Doc Holliday. Only tuberculosis could fit him for a casket.<br /><br />Did we need to see Wyatt Earp's floundering marriage and his subsequent romance with the stage actress? Not really, not in a testosterone-driven revenge movie like this. TOMBSTONE is all about slick black coats and lawlessness being tamed, about Russell's fierceness and his handlebar 'stache, and Val Kilmer looking like death warmed over and yet still expertly dealing in lead. Law comes to Tombstone and it's keeping an eye out for red sashes, mustache combs, and maybe some cough drops.</p></body></html>

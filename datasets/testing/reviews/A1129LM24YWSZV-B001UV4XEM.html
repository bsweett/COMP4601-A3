<meta name="summary" content="Crazy Vegas movie"></head><body><p>The Hangover tells the story of a group of four friends: soon-to-be-married Doug, wild man Phil, sedate dentist Stu, and Alan, the brother of Doug's intended.<br /><br />For Doug's bachelor party, the guys head to Vegas for a night on the town. The next thing we know, three of the four friends wake up in their trashed hotel room with absolutely no memory of the evening prior. Doug's missing, there's a live tiger in the bathroom, and judging from the evidence in their pockets, members in their party both got married and went to the hospital during the evening's shenanigans.<br /><br />The rest of the movie finds Phil, Stu, and Alan trying to retrace their steps and find the missing bridegroom. The convoluted plot has them gambling to earn Doug's ransom money and doing everything they can not to wreck a loaned Mercedes.<br /><br />Hubs and I laughed and laughed and laughed.<br /><br />Be forewarned - this movie is NOT for the easily offended. There are tons of absolutely horrible language, VERY adult situations, nudity, and everything else you would expect to see when four guys are up to no good in Vegas.<br /><br />But if you can get past that, the script is hilarious (You will be quoting the one-liners for WEEKS.), there are some really fun cameos, and the whole thing feels like a bawdy and thoroughly enjoyable adult romp.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood & company create a million to one classic"></head><body><p>Actor Martin Landau whom I usually respect, casually dismissed this film as just another boxing movie.  Boy, was he far off the track, for boxing is just the background for a drama about how one committed person can affect the other's lives.  Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman clearly deserved the Oscar for their roles and Eastwood turns in one of his most heartfelt performances--he was also nominated for an Oscar and the pic itself won Best Picture along with Best Director (Eastwood). I admired Clint's restraint of the material never forcing the material to feel syrupy or sentimental like a Spielberg or a Garry Marshal--he allows it to come out of the writing and the acting.  In the end, if you're not moved by this picture then you must be made of stone or from another planet.</p></body></html>

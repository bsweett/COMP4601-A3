<meta name="summary" content="Just not as good as some other animated movies, but still worth a watch."></head><body><p>This is a story about a penguin who doesn't fit in.  Amongst a family of singers, he has no voice.  However, his energy get's transferred elsewhere, and he can dance.  This movie features a great cast of voices such as robin williams, elihja woods, nichole kidmann,and britney murphy, but that just can't get you through some of the droneing that this movie seems to have in it.  It feels a lot like March of The Penguins at the beginning, but animated. But when they start to sing, it really gets boring after a bit, and makes the plot thin.  The ultimate thing is the spoiler of the political undertone.  It's not just a fun kid's movie, it is one that tries to make a big statement about humans changing the envioroment, a good message, but it's just sort of forced in here.  Overall a decent film to see once, borrow it if you must, so someone else who may have bought this can claim they got their money's worth.</p></body></html>

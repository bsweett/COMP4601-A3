<meta name="summary" content="Well paced and characterized"></head><body><p>This is a great movie with action, drama and mystery as Richard Kimbal (Ford) escapes from legal custody and must figure out not only who has stolen his life, but why.<br /><br />The action and direction are very well done here, but the real achievement is the characterization. The people inhabiting this world feel real and identifiable. We understand the reasoning behind their actions, "good" or "bad". If that were not the case (as in the sequel, "U.S. Marshals") we couldn't care what happened.<br /><br />Ford is perfect. He is appropriately intense and sympathetic.<br />Jones is excellent. Appropriately acerbic, sarcastic and caring.<br />Jones' team of marshals is perfect. The characters are distinct and fleshed out. No unnecessary redundancies in characterization.<br /><br />One satisfying twist on the "chase movie" cliche is that the antagonist, Gerard, is not actually the bad guy. He's after an escaped convict, but he's not the one who murdered Kimball's wife or framed him for the murder. More than anything, he wants justice. Even if it means he may have to change his mind about what that entails.<br /><br />Great movie. A must have for any complete library.</p></body></html>

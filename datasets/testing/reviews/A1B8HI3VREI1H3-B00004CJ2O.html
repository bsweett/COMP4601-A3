<meta name="summary" content="Friday the 13th(1980)"></head><body><p>Friday the 13th(1980) is a classic slasher horror film. The reviews for the film have been good and bad. One of my movie books gave it a "turkey"! This first film in the series is directed by Sean S. Cunningham from a script by Victor Miller. The music score by Harry Mandredini sounds just as good as any Bernard Herrmann score. The "bad guy" in the film is Pamela Voorhees(Betsy Palmer). She goes insane after the Camp Crystal Lake counselors abuse her son Jason and let him drown in the lake. Jason Voorhees doesn't start killing people until Friday the 13th Part 2(1981). Adrienne King plays Alice, the film's heroine.<br />Robbi Morgan plays a cute, bubbly brunette who is killed off 30 minutes into the movie! Tom Savini(Dawn of the Dead) did a good job designing the make up and gore effects. Friday the 13th has a fair amount of blood and guts, but it's tame compared to the sequels, the 2009 remake, and the recent "torture-porn horror movies". Friday the 13th is full of creepiness and atmosphere. It was well-made considering its low budget. It tries to emulate films such as Psycho(1960), Carrie(1976) and Halloween(1978). Nothing supernatural happens in Friday the 13th(1980) until the climax. A young Kevin Bacon plays a camp counselor. Siskel and Ebert were big detractors of the Friday the 13th film series. They showed a clip from this film on their TV special Women in Danger. Around 1980, they were sick and tired of reviewing slasher/horror movies on a weekly basis. Friday the 13th does have some filler scenes such as Alice making a cup of coffee or someone fixing a car. The film is honest about the fact that it didn't have any "A-list movie stars" at the time. Most of the credits are saved for the end of the film.<br />Paramount Pictures distributed Friday the 13th in the U.S.A. while Warner Bros. distributed the film in foreign countries.<br />Friday the 13th(1980) is a solid horror film that spawned many sequels, a remake, and a bunch of rip offs.</p></body></html>

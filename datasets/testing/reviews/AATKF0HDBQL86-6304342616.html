<meta name="summary" content="Independence Day ROCKS!!"></head><body><p>I've always loved alien invasion stories, and Independence Day is the best I've ever seen!  From the first scene to the last, this alien invasion story is a veritable feast for the senses, with flying saucers, "kewl" explosions, and aliens that make even the classic movies' aliens look like pussycats by comparison.<p>What makes Independence Day so wonderful for me is the fact that there is also a genuine story to it that gives it dimension and depth.  It tells the tale of President Thomas Whitmore (the always charming Bill Pullman), a man who is suddenly forced to confront something he'd always thought was a figment of science fiction writers' imaginations--an alien invasion force that could possibly wipe out the entire human race.  He finds himself forced to enlist the aid of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), his former nemesis and the estranged husband of his White House aide, Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), and David's father, Julius (Judd Hirsch).  As the survivors drift toward Groom Lake and the mysterious Area 51, Whitmore meets up with Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith), a young Marine who lost his best friend Jimmy (Harry Connick Jr.) in the initial attack, and Hiller's girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) and her son; Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a Vietnam vet and alien abductee; and Brackish Okun (Star Trek: The Next Generation's Brent Spiner), the crackpot head scientist of Area 51.  He is also reunited with his wife and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore (Mary McDonnell) in one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed in a film.<p>One of the things I liked most about this DVD was the fact that it allowed me to choose between both the theatrical release and the director's cut, which has some scenes cut from the theatrical release.  There is also a second DVD that is chock-full of extras, including a Russell Casse scene that was ultimately left out of even the director's cut, but which was pretty cool nonetheless.  Ultimately, I have to say that this is a DVD that was worth every penny I paid for it.</p></body></html>

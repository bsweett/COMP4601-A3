<meta name="summary" content="A very moving film"></head><body><p>There are essentially three very moving tales in this excellent film. Viewers hoping to learn about what happens to people after death, whether there is something or nothing, will be disappointed, because this is not the film's purpose. The hereafter is a backdrop to the three tales that Clint Eastwood directs and Matt Damon acts in very well.<br /><br />One story is about the character played by Damon. He discovers that he has the ability to see and hear a dead relative of a person who he touches. But he has no idea where the dead person is or what life is like after death. He is traumatized by this ability. He feels that it is a curse rather than a blessing. He realizes that his ability helps others and makes them feel good, but he feels that it ruins his own life. He wants to live like other people. He doesn't even want others to know about his ability. We see an episode where he is virtually compelled to use his ability and the effect that it has on him. He is searching for a normal life and we watch to see if it is attainable.<br /><br />The second story, which, as the third, ultimately entwines in Damon's story, is about a highly successful French female reporter who is pronounced dead after being drowned in a tsunami. She experiences the well-known phenomenon of a person seeing a white light and moving towards the light. However, she recovers. She has difficulty getting over what she has seen and it affects her life.<br /><br />The third tale is about two male pre-teen young twins. They are unusually close; very loving toward each other. This is especially so because their mother, who they love dearly is an alcoholic and uses drugs. One of the twins is killed when a truck hits him, and the other mourns him greatly. He searches for someone to help him communicate with his brother.</p></body></html>

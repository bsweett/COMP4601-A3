I tried to ignore the Razzie people's seven nominations for this film but they seem to have gotten it right.  Halle Berry should fire her agent.  The Academy is asking her for it's Oscar back.  Where to begin?  Bad direction.  Never trust a director with a one name monicker(i.e. McG of "Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle" fame).  Pitof seems to have gotten his start in making bad music videos and translated it to the big screen.  Bad script.  The writers of this drivel have never met a cat joke it couldn't resist.  My personal fave is when Halle is revived from the dead by the cats it looks like she's coughing up a hairball.  Bad acting.  Halle looks ridiculous playing the frump at the beginning and doesn't have a clue as to how to play Catwoman.  The best part of her performance is when she sports the leather catsuits.  The gymnastics are impressive but it's obvious that they were done by stuntdoubles and computer graphics.  Sharon Stone is not entering middle-age gracefully.  She comes off more shrill than villainous.  Only Benjamin Bratt as Halle's cop boyfriend escapes this fiasco with any dignity.  I would give this film one star but I don't truly hate it.  I had fun picking apart the film's faults.  Besides, with the purchase of this DVD I can get two free issues of "Suede" magazine with the option to subscribe.</p></body></html>

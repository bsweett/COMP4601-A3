<meta name="summary" content="Law Abiding Citizen"></head><body><p>Ten years after his wife and daughter are brutally murdered, returns to extract justice from the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case against their killers. His vengeance threatens not only the man who allowed mercy to supersede justice, but also the system and the city that made it so. This movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the main character Clyde really makes this movie something memorable and just extraordinary. Jamie Fox also does a great job playing his character, a heroic yet corrupt lawyer. This movie has a few twists and turns and will always keep you guessing. If you want to see something that is highly suspenseful, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and includes two very unique and questionable characters, then you must see this movie. "Law Abiding Citizen" will not disappoint.</p></body></html>

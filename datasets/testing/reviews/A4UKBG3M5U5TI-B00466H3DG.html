Teaming with Director Michel Gondry for the second time (they made the semi-flop "Human Nature" in 2001), they have made a great film, perhaps the best from a Kaufman script.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the unlikely stars, both cast against type.  Carrey excels as a withdrawn and depressed man who meets a free-spirited neurotic, played by Winslet, who's never been better.  The two have a fling and seem to bring out the best in each other, although it quickly devolves.  Winslet decides to have her memories of Carrey erased by Lacuna Inc., which jump starts the time-bending plot.  Kaufman's scripts are always pleasantly off-beat and funny, as is "Eternal Sunshine."  However, what Kaufman has added this time around are some keen perceptions about relationships.  Carrey and Winslet manage, against all odds, to portray a believable couple and the results are genuine moments of understanding and heartbreak.<br /><br />Every remaining element of the film is superior.  Gondry's direction is masterful, aided significantly by the cinematography of Ellen Kuras (Blow, Swoon).  The supporting cast are also excellent: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo & Elijah Wood (as the amusing memory-busters), and Tom Wilkinson.  Overall, this film is the best of 2004 so far and stands poised to become a modern classic.<br /><br />DVD Extras: The DVD is packed, including interviews, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a director's commentary, and deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

I was anxiously awaiting Kill Bill vol.2.<br /><br />After a the day it came out, my friend said it stunk because it had hardly any violence.  I decided to check it out anyway, I thought maybe it had a story.  So when I checked it out just like my friend said it was low with voilnece, but the plot was the movie's saving grace.<br /><br />Kill Bill vol 2 totaly fills all the voids that it's predicessor had.  You find out all the answers to the questions Kill Bill vol 1 left you with.<br /><br />This movie still has it's moments of violence, but only few people die, compered to the 74 that died in Kill Bill vol.1.<br /><br />Altho I usally prefer violence over plot(Ex. John Woo movies), this movie also had a touchy side to it, which got me a little, but not much.<br /><br />Those who loved Kill Bill vol 1, but are expecting all violence and gore, and no plot, will undeniably be dissapointed.  Those who want a sequal to cherrish as part of the saga will surley be appeased.  If it wasn't for my friend, libaly, I'd be dissapointed just like he did.<br /><br />peace</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It is good but far from great"></head><body><p>This a bold. challenging, ingenious yet flawed movie. It is mostly for film buffs/sci fi fans and arty types.<br /><br />The premise is fascinating...women are now infertile and the human race is dying out. The world has gone down the crapper. Immigrants are now subjected to concentration camps and are considered lower than low. There is a discovery of a pregnant immigrant and her baby will be the subject of some type of multiple illicit political ploys.<br /><br />Clive Owen is a real cool actor. He is no action hero yet he is a man's man. He is not loud and brash yet he radiates charisma. His acting talent was effectively demonstrated in the terrific drama "Closer".<br /><br />There are two action sequences that are quite harrowing. One involves an unexpected ambush in a car and the other is Clive Owen chasing/looking for a baby while an apartment building is in the midst of a military attack. Both scenes involve (I believe) just one camera take (a la "Saving Private Ryan's" opening beach battle scene) so you know the battle does not take place on a sound stage but rather it is laid out in a more elaborate manner. The long takes makes it look like it is really taking place, like it is a documentary.<br /><br />An issue with the movie is the lack of narrative. I guess, the viewer catches wind of what is going on while Clive Owen's charactor does but the effect makes the movie slow at times. It is hard to understand the depth of any of the charactors because of this type of story telling. Charactors come and go (like... die off) and the movie really does not deal with it.<br /><br />Lastly, (I am not giving away anything), the ending is abrubt and very unfullfilling. The movie starts out slow. builds up steam, captures your passion and then has a very weak ending. That may not be the film's fault since the movie is adapted from a novel. Whatever it was, I thought the movie was anticlimactic.<br /><br />Now, I give this movie a big thumbs up because it was great science fiction. It was no lasers/robots/spaceships sci fi but, rather, a plausible plot occuring in the not so distant future. You would have to think about this flick when it's over.<br /><br />This may be like a Stanely Kubrick movie where you just are not going to get it upon one viewing. Theer are a lot of subtleties in the movie that may need a second analysis.<br /><br />Since there are so many problems in today's world, I like a good dommsday movie. It seems very topical.</p></body></html>

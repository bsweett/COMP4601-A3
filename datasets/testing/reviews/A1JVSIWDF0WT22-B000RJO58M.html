On one hand HOT FUZZ gave me a headache with it's loud action and constant inclusion of loud noises, caused by close-ups of several artifacts, constantly shown to irritate the very uptight lead. On the other, not too often do I laugh out loud at a movie several times, including at scenes where the joke is telegraphed well in advance (fascist............. hag!). In the modern Hollywood movie machine, the hardest thing to find is a comedy with actual laughs and HOT FUZZ is certainly that, just make sure to bring along a couple of aspirin !</p></body></html>

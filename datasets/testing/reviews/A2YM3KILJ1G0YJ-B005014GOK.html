<meta name="summary" content="Machete - The Mexican Shaft"></head><body><p>For those of you who enjoy Grindhouse films, there is no real need to read much further than this first sentence.  Just drop me a helpful on your way out the door, because you need to watch Machete NOW.  For those who need convincing...<br /><br />Machete is a brilliant display of exploitation, actually a subgenre of grindhouse films called Mexploitation that celebrates Mexican life while dealing with drugs, crime, sex, and money.  Initially just a humorous teaser between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0TM5S">Planet Terror</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0TM5I">Death Proof</a>, a combo from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, the story of an ex-Federale nicknamed "Machete" seeking revenge just had to be made as an homage film.  The result is undeniably entertaining.  The combination of incredible action without the dreaded shaky-cam, off the charts sexploitation, several humorous bits that heavy-handedly lampoon the incessant political hyperbole, ingenious use of everything within hand's reach for weapons, nudity or partial nudity from all just about all female cast-members (Rodriguez has never looked sexier and Alba is en fuego)...what's the point, this review could reach Moby Dick proportions if I listed everything I liked.  Needless to say, credits caused audible crowd celebration<br /><br />For gorehounds, this movie will definitely, unequivocally not disappoint.  Ignoring the obvious plethora of decapitations and double-taps that produce enough blood to fill Seaworld, let me just say there is one brilliant scene in which someone gets eviscerated and his intestines are used for urban repelling.<br /><br />The cast is unreal.  If someone had told me before this film that DeNiro, Seagal, Don Johnson, and Jeff Fahey were all bad guys, I would have been floored.  Believe it people, because Danny Trejo holds down the other side just fine with his low-rider Army headed by executive officers Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez (Alba is an ICE agent and Rodriguez is a resistance leader).  The cherry on top is the combo of shotgun wielding priest played by Cheech Marin and hitman for hire played by Tom Savini.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is responsible for just about everything awesome in this film, and it's pretty clear he enjoyed making it.  Several portions of the script are hilarious, and I'm still singing the chorus to the titular named song that accompanied Trejo through one of his carnage sprees.  The over-the-top nature of this film is pure gold that comes off as a cross between a Mexican version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790743752">Shaft</a>, a low-rider car show, a more violent version of Bronson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>, and Cinemax softcore fun (except the leading man is a 60+ year old ex-con covered in jailhouse tats and coarse, scarred skin).  The only flaw is the political discourse which, contrary to what some other reviewers have mentioned, is far from forgotten or dismissed.  Nonetheless, one speedbump can't stop an avalanche of awesome.<br /><br />I hope the fact that this started as a tongue-in-cheek teaser is inspiration enough to create at least one of the tongue-in-cheek sequels mentioned at the end of the movie.  We should all be so lucky.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

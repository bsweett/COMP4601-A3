<meta name="summary" content="Fabulous foreign film fantasy"></head><body><p>Mexican born director, Guillermo del Toro's magnificently crafted fantasy "Pan's Labyrinth" is a film geared toward an adult audience. Filmed in Spain, it is set in the post Spanish Civil War countryside in 1944.  A young girl Ofelia played superbly by Ivana Baquero is being transported along with her mother to an uncertain future in a rural province.<br /><br />Her widowed mother Carmen played by Ariadna Gil has remarried and is joining her new husband Captain Vidal played by Sergi Lopez.  The captain is a grotesque sadistic martinet who cares only for the baby carried by the pregnant Carmen.  The draconian circumstances of her surroundings pushes Ofelia into a fantasy world populated by fairies and a faun like creature presumably Pan.<br /><br />The fantasy world is based in a stone labyrinth adjacent to the mill in which the captain and his troops are headquartered.  She is convinced that she is Princess Moana, daughter of the king of the underworld.  She must perform some tasks designated by the faun to re-enter this magical land.<br /><br />del Toro finds a proper balance between fantasy and reality to tell this touching story in which a young child must navigate herself through a series of dire incidents which will delineate her future.</p></body></html>

This is not the first time a movie has been made on such issues, though its an improvement over such films such as The 6th Day.  With a great cast, excellent use of cgi action in a futuristic setting, and a fine plot - one would think it is an overall success.  It is enjoybale in the end, but the three main elements seem to clash along the lines too often to keep it from perfection.<br /><br />The movie begins with the enclosed lifestyles of the clones, though we don't know that they are clones quite yet.  It brings up many questions as to what exactly is going on, and though a bit slow at times, it doesn't really matter cause it makes you want to keep watching to figure all this out.  Once we discover the meaning of what is exactly going on, the thrills of the chase and action begins, and that's where it gets exciting yet the story gets a bit crumbled down.  Then comes the question of if this is exactly right, what people are doing to these clones, and it comes to the point that even bad guys will do good when the line is pushed too far in their field of work (you'll know what I mean when you see the Djimon Hounsou character).<br /><br />If the moral/ethical point of view is tiresome or doesn't interest you, there is still plenty of sci-fi thrill to entertain, as well as plenty of humor thrown into the mix.  Again, the cast list is impressive, and even the smaller roles seem to play an interesting part in this film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine movie that is good but not great.  Things don't flow too smoothly altogether, but this is still a movie sure to entertain and make a great comment about ethics and morality about longlivety.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

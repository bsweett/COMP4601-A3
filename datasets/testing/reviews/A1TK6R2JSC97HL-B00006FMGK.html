(Romulans are perennial rivals of the Federation, and their background hints at the Chinese as well as imperial Rome).  Though Romulan generals are backing the move (in which the entire senate is killed by a mysterious radiation weapon that shrivels them), the real culprits are "Remans" - Nosferatu-looking denizens of Romulus's sister world.  Leading the faction is a young man who is neither Romulan nor Reman, but a cloned human named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  We learn that Romulans had cloned Starfleet Captain Picard years ago in hopes of substituting him and subverting Earth from within.  When the plan never panned out, Shinzon was discarded and sent to an almost certain death in the dilitium mines of Remus.  Big mistake - couldn't those silly Romulans have realized that Shinzon would survive the experience to become steeped in hatred of both Romulans and humans?  That he would rise to lead the Remans?  To build a monster super-starship that outguns and outruns anything built by anybody else in the Galaxy? And that he'd become everybody's problem?  Not realizing Shinzon's intentions or his origins, Starfleet dispatches Picard to Romulus to greet Shinzon - now the Praetor.  Before then, the Enterprise makes an unplanned stop on a remote pre-spaceflight world where they discover and activate an earlier model of Data.  Reaching Romulus, Picard soon learns the secret of their shared DNA and Shinzon's plans for Earth and the Romulans.<br /><br />At best, Nemesis is okay - though at worst, it's got a loose plot that unravels quickly - richer than "First Contact", but inferior to that film which was more tightly plotted.  The Picard in "Contact" had some genuine character flaw - will he let his hatred of the Borg sway him from taking the right course?  Here, he's just compulsively noble.  Just about every scene raises questions, and not the kind that scripts should engender - Picard becomes a one-man fighting machine aboard Shinzon's ship; the Remans can snatch Picard off the Enterprise, but can't locate him on their own ship? Shinzon is supposed to be a clone of Picard - but was Picard bald at that age?  Also, he looks, acts and thinks nothing like Picard (though, in a thematic sense, the main characters are so interchangeable, they are largely clones of each other); the crew lands on a primitive planet whose backward inhabitants have otherwise matched Starfleet in the critical technology of dune-buggies.  Fans of Worf will lament his under-use hear (he seems snappy, like he knows that he's about to become somebody's punchline).  The script plays up the sentimental connections between main characters, even as it makes them as stiff as ever.  The story itself seems a pastiche of storylines from other Treks, especially the classic "Wrath of Khan" (the villain is an obsessed enemy with a painful past; a weapon that can render whole worlds lifeless; starship dogfighting inside of some nebula-looking thing climaxes the movie, along with an act of sacrifice by one of our heroes) and there aren't enough plot turns or twists to set Nemesis apart from the rest.<br /><br />Still, it's a decent flick that won't send you scurrying for a copy of "Attack of the Clones".</p></body></html>

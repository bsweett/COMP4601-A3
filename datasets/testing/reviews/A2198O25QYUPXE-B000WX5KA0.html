<meta name="summary" content="Inside the distorted mind of a troubled man"></head><body><p>"Taxi Driver" is a psychological thriller film where the viewer stands in the shoes of deluded Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro. Bickle presents as a social misfit who is looking for a job to fill his sleepless nights. His reality is certainly skewed as he takes a potential girlfriend, Betsy, to a pornographic movie screening as a first date. From Bickle's point of view the decay of society surrounds him, and he seeks to rid the city of seedy elements. Iris, a child prostitute, becomes a reason for him to carry out his plan, and she in many ways is an important focus in his life. De Niro convincingly plays Bickle with a deadpan persona that is driven purely by an invented concept of right and wrong.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></body></html>

For the umpteenth time, we have a successful, workaholic father (George Clooney as Matt King) juggling three problems: 1) attempting to be more "parental" with older, estranged, profane daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and uninhibited younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), 2)monitoring the comatose, near-death state of his adventurous wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), and 3) as trustee pondering how to dispose of prime Hawaii seafront real estate: sell it and make many family beneficiaries obscenely rich or preserve its pristine beauty. As you can see, Matt's plate is overflowing.<br /><br />The movie is about how Matt methodically and gradually addresses his three problems. To some degree, "The Descendants" is ultimately predictable. However, what is novel is the theme that we almost never act from purely noble, altruistic motives. In the decisions Matt makes, he simultaneously shows patience and exasperation, -self-control and vengeance, reconciliation and resentment.<br /><br />For example, as he tries to reestablish a connection with Alex, Matt is fumblingly, hilariously, and sadly ineffective. That is, until he learns that his wife was having a clandestine affair. Matt, of course, is fiercely determined to ferret out the slime who cuckolded him, though this "righteous crusade" is somewhat tempered by the fact that Elizabeth may have cheated on him because Matt neglected her in favor of work. Perked up by the prospect of this juicy, scandalous mystery, Alex slowly drops her "sullen teen" facade and eagerly helps her dad discover that a Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), a real-estate broker, is responsible. Therefore, at least and partially for underhanded reasons, they grudgingly get closer, though as the movie progresses, their relationship improves for more honorable ones.<br /><br />As another example, Matt finally confronts Brian at his rented seaside cottage about the affair. But instead of getting into a spirited fistfight that would shatter the lawyer's reputation, Matt quietly but determinedly interrogates Brian about his tryst with Elizabeth and informs him about Elizabeth's tragic state. Again, Matt's logical way of handling this seems more humane, but it is also more searingly effective in wounding and humbling Brian, and eventually Brian's wife Julie (Judy Greer), to whom he confesses. It also exposes Brian for the cowardly louse he is, since he refuses to visit Elizabeth on her sick/death bed and sends his wife instead.<br /><br />Matt displays his ulterior motives regarding the land sale. With his family members, he views the breathtaking property and realizes it would be commercially vile to condemn it to condo development. Therefore, he gathers the cousin beneficiaries together to tell them that he will not sign the land over to developers. But his new-found environmentalism is not the only reason for Matt's decision. He also doesn't want the idle cousins, who never cared for the land in any way and only acquired it through descent, to profit. But Brian, coincidentally, was orchestrating the deal, and Matt REALLY doesn't want HIM to profit.<br /><br />As the final example, Matt discontinues life support for his wife when the doctors tell him that her head trauma from a boating accident will eventually doom her. Of course, this is an obvious act of charity and a concession to her "Do Not Resuscitate" wishes. However, it also gives the all-too-human Matt, his daughters, and his in-laws the chance to vent about her flaws and failures and infidelities without her actually hearing it. Hypocritically, Matt even tries to restrain the others' ventings, especially from Brian's wife, as if only he has the right to complain unreservedly against his wife.  Nevertheless the venting eases Matt's reconciliation with his wife, and makes the post-cremation ash-scattering into the ocean that much easier and truly genuine.<br /><br />To make peace with the world, we must sort out our mixed selfish and not-so-selfish feelings as we stumble towards some kind of resolution. Even when we make the "right" decisions, we often do so for at least partially "wrong" reasons. Matt and company learn this anguished and sobering lesson in "The Descendants".</p></body></html>

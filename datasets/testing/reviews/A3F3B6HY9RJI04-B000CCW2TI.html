<meta name="summary" content="Bad and Slow Plot"></head><body><p>Here is the situation.  Lisa Reisert(Rachel McAdams) is being forced to obey Jack Ripper(Cillian Murphy) (get it, Jack the Ripper?) to make a phone call or else Jack will call his buddy who is waiting outside Lisa's father's house with a 12-inch knife.<br /><br />So, in this post-9/11 world, why doesn't Lisa just yell "Bomb", get Jack arrested, call the police and have the guy with the knife arrested before he can do anything?  I don't know either.<br /><br />It was pretty slow.  I think they made it as exciting as they could for being on an airplane.  I mean, you can't have too much excitement on an airplane without arrousing too much attention and ruining everything.  But with what little they had to work with, I'll give Wes Craven a few thumbs up for the tension that he is able to create.<br /><br />The tension builds up to an intense ending that actually raised my pulse rate a bit.  In other words, the only thing worth catching in this movie is the last 10 minutes of it.  I even think it helped bump it up to 2 stars!<br /><br />If I could once again choose what to do this last two hours, it wouldn't be watching this movie.  I'd recommend avoiding this movie unless you really have nothing else to do.</p></body></html>

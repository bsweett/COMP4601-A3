<meta name="summary" content="No real Achilles' Heel"></head><body><p>Based on Homer's Illiad, there is an ironic connection to how this movie was received.  Some may have been wary of another big-budget Hollywood production, and thought of the classic proverb, "beware those who would bring false gifts."  The concern was unwarranted, as this movie is stunning in every way from beginning to end, and PACKED with major players from the ultimate battle movies.  Warriors from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GX5Y">300</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a> all do battle in one movie!<br /><br />Agamemnon (Brian Cox - who was awesome in Braveheart as Argyle Wallace and showed enough range to be hilarious as Captain O'Hagan in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKMN">Super Troopers</a>) is a power hungry king who has challenged enough other kings to control most of Greece.  The only land that stands in his way of controlling the Aegean is Troy, ruled by pacifist-leaning Priam (Peter O'Toole).  Boromir from LOTR (Sean Bean) - plays Odysseus, a sycophant king to the now ruler of kings, Agamemnon.  Odysseus just happens to be a mentor and friend to the greatest warrior ever, Achilles (Pitt).  Fighting alongside Achilles is his second-in-command, Eudorus (Vincent Regan).  You will recognize him as the guy who was awesome as Leonidas's captain in 300.<br /><br />As peace is being worked out between Agamemnon's Greek forces and the emerging armies of Troy, two Trojan princes are treated as guests by Agamemnon: Prince Hector (Eric Bana) is his land's greatest warrior; and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom aka Legolas from LOTR) is his younger, "Don Juan" brother.  When they leave they have an extra passenger, Helen (Diane Kruger) - who is now "of Troy" but was once "of Sparta" - and the peace being discussed is destroyed because she just happens to be married to King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson - Hamish Campbell from Braveheart), Agamemnon's brother.  Now disgraced, Menelaus gives Agamemnon the reason he needed for war with Troy, a previously unbreached city thought undefeatable.  And, just for good measure, the rugged Campbell father from Braveheart plays Glaucus (James Cosmo), a top soldier in the Trojan Army.<br /><br />If all this is confusing, don't worry; the movie is still great.  Enjoy the epic war scenes similar to the movies from which they have borrowed cast members, tragically snicker at the fact that you know what the "Trojan Horse" is all about (and that the city of Troy falls to such a ridiculous trick), and revel in a classic sword battle between Achilles and Hector.  Actually, try not to enjoy one battle more than others, because this movie is saturated with great action like Achilles' complete domination of the monstrous Thessalian warrior Boagrius (Nathan Jones aka Petr from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SM6FLI">The Condemned</a>).<br /><br />From beginning to end this movie is superb.  The lighting, acting, scenery, musical score, costume design and casting all reflect impressively on the entire movie's efforts.  I didn't care to go too much into the historical aspect of the movie, but from what I can tell all the major details fairly consistent with the truth.  This is right up there with 300 and Braveheart, and is a can't miss action flick.</p></body></html>

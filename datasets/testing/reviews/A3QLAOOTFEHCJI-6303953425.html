I guess what makes Tarantino interesting is that his excess in violence is augmented by goodly amounts of humor and wit.  In this multi-faceted take on organized crime, the primary focus is on 2 hit men.  One is a black man with a jerry curl (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner is a white dude with stringy long hair (John Travolta).  Their business is strong arming people and killing them if necessary.  They work for crime boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).<br /><br />The movie opens and closes on a restaurant where a "wired" couple (Tim Roth & Amanda Plummer) are in the process of robbing all the customers.  In between the two scenes with get the hit men botch a hit on drug suppliers holding out on Marcellus.  It's graphic but hilarious at the same time.  Then in one of the great scenes in film, Marcellus wants Vincent (Travolta) to squire around his antsy wife Mia (Uma Thurman) for the evening.  Not wanting to risk anything with Mia, Vincent injects a little heroin.  After the classic twist contest at the rock `n roll diner, Mia discovers what she thinks is cocaine in Vincent's jacket and snorts it.  A no no.  She goes into convulsions, so Vincent takes her to his dealer where the famous scene where they inject adrenaline directly into her heart takes place.<br /><br />In another tangent storyline a boxer (Bruce Willis) is set to throw a fight at the order of Marcellus.  He doesn't so he must escape quickly after the fight.  In an unlikely coincidence Marcellus and Butch (Willis) run into each other at a stoplight.  They nearly kill each other but stumble into a KKK/Nazi-style pawn shop where they are bound and gagged and prepared for...well, rape.  Tarantino's movies aren't like any other.  There is nothing ever traditional about them.  They purposely go way over the top.  The detail is finely honed, right down to Jules' (Jackson) wallet in the final scene.  Watching this movie 18 years after its release, I'm still entertained and exhilarated.<br /><br />This single disc Blu ray has an excellent 2.35:1 video transfer and a DTS-HD Master Audio sound layer in 5.1.  For some reason I had to crank the volume level up a few notches more than usual to get all the dialog.  There are plenty of additional features including interviews, critic's retrospective evaluation, a couple featurettes, a clip from Siskel & Ebert's "At the Movies", award show footage, deleted scenes and more.</p></body></html>

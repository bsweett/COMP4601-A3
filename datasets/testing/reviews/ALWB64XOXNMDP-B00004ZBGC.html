<meta name="summary" content="Humans and apes battle for freedom!"></head><body><p>What's so scary about this movie is that on one level it's entertaining and yet so true about society. The humans have the apes doing all the work in a society where dogs and cats were wiped out by a virus. Something that could very well happen today.  The apes were domesticated and introduced but very soon made slaves. <p>Ricardo Manltaban was the circus trainer that teaches Ceasar to intergrate into human society. I wish they didn't finish his character off so easily.  He didn't get credit for his small but important role in the film.  <p>Well, to make a long story short Ceasar tells the apes they are being used! They get mad as heck and won't take it anymore!  Riots and violence result and the humans take second billing on the planet called Earth.</p></body></html>

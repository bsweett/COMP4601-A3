<meta name="summary" content="Amadeus, Amadeus... Oh, Amadeus !"></head><body><p>I have to confess that I really, really don't like historical dramas. I usually find them overbearing and tedious. This may sound hypocrite coming from a guy who loves three-hour movies, but when there's nothing engaging in the material, 1.5 hours of dreck can be quite long. <p>Amadeus is not such a movie. It is a historical drama done right. Despite its title, its main character is not Amadeus Mozart, but rather Salieri, contemporary composer and rival who has claimed to have murdered Mozart. The movie is not based on the real facts of the matter (we will probably never know, anyway), but on an interpretation of the facts. Amadeus is historically accurate, as far as it goes, even down to Mozart's annoying laugh, which was described by a contemporary as "metal scraping glass". <p>Here, Salieri sees Mozart as God's incarnation on Earth - and since God has refused to give him the ultimate talent to sing his praises, and instead gave it to that vulgar iconoclast kid, he will do everything in his power, use all his wiles, to defeat and kill him. <p>It is a story of religious delusion, yes, but clearly also about mediocrity. The mediocre always seek to enslave the successful, be it in politics (suffice it to see the success of social programs and socialization of vital institutions) or otherwise. Salieri suffers : he is good enough to know that Mozart is an absolute genius, but cannot be elevated to his level. <p>For sure, the sets are sumptuous, and the acting right on the note. The accents are distracting, the acting can be slightly overbearing, and the music is overwhelming at times. But there is no point in overaccentuating those : this is a masterpiece, deserving of all the praises it got.</p></body></html>

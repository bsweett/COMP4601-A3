Give me a break!"></head><body><p>Within the last ten years or so I saw the original 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate on video.  I remember feeling tension and getting caught up in the plot.  I can't say that much for this newly released version.<br /><br />The world is different than it was in 1962.  We're all jaded from the politics around us.  And we crave something more than a science fiction story that tries hard to include elements of modern politics.  For example, the threat now is really corporate greed rather than communism.  And there are references to recent incidents that seem right out of today's headlines as well as political speeches that can be attributed to a wide variety of real-life candidates.  I think that's what interrupted my involvement with the story line.  I was just so busy trying to figure out how it all applies to what is going on right now that I just couldn't get caught up in how the hocus pocus of implanted computer chips would impact a presidential election.<br /><br />The actors all did a great job, especially Denzel Washington, cast as a former Gulf War officer who is trying to solve the mystery of his frequent nightmares and memories that don't seem to make sense.  Liev Schreiber was once a member of his patrol and has come home a war hero and is now running for the vice-presidency of the United States.  Schreiber's mother is Meryl Streep, an outspoken senator who will stop at nothing to get her son elected.  Much of the time, however, I had to struggle to follow the plot and, later, when I tried to put it all together, I found too many loose ends to make conclusion satisfying.<br /><br />One of the problems with this film is that it tried too hard.  The modern politics didn't ring true, especially when we're surrounded every day with the real thing.  There was some sort of political statement hidden in the story that never came across as authentic.  And, in spite of good acting, I never cared about the characters.<br /><br />I can't tell you not to bother with this film.  It might make you think about some of the horrors of corporate takeover of the world.  But this particular story is too convoluted to make that meaningful.  I therefore give this 2004 version of The Manchurian candidate no better than a lukewarm recommendation.</p></body></html>

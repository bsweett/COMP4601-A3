<meta name="summary" content="LORD OF THE BONES"></head><body><p>Oscar winning director Peter Jackson shifts gears with this haunting translation of Alice Sebold's bestseller.  The movie is beautifully filmed with gorgeous fantasy other worlds matched with stunning vistas of the real world.  While Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon are fine in their roles, the movie belongs to Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci.  Ronan is stunning as the murdered girl caught in a purgatory torn between her lust for revenge and a need to provide solace to her grieving family.  Tucci's quietly malevolent killer is chilling.  I would have preferred a more appropriate finish to his character, his ironic death is disturbingly satisfying.  Not the classic it should have been, THE LOVELY BONES is nonetheless quality film-making.</p></body></html>

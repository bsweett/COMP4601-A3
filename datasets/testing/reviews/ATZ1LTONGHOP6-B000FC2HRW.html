<meta name="summary" content="Little originality, but who cares?"></head><body><p>In my opinion, the original "Final Destination" was one of the best horror films to surface in the wave of post-"Scream" horror films that emerged in the late 1990's. The idea of a group of teenagers "cheating death" and then having "death" come back to collect them was a great one and with all of the elaborate death sequences, it was extremely well executed (excuse the pun) too. Evidently, I wasn't the only person out there who thought this, because "Final Destination 3" is essentially just a remake of the first "Final Destination" and why would you remake something if the idea didn't have merit to begin with? Of course, since "Final Destination 3" is just a remake, why bother to watch it at all; why not just re-watch "Final Destination"? The answer to that question depends on why you liked the first film to begin with.<br /><br />If you are looking for originality of plot, then don't bother with "Final Destination 3". It's not there. This film will just give you a 89 minute feeling of deja vu. However, if you want to see yet another series of gruesome and elaborate death sequences, then you've come to the right place. The death sequences in this instalment are even better than those in the previous two films, and in spite of myself, I found myself eagerly anticipating each new death. Guessing who would be the next victim and how they would die was fun and the 89 minutes of the film literally just vanished, I was so engrossed in it (something which I can't say about many films). I won't give away the details of any of the deaths, since that would spoil the fun, but if that's why you like this series, then you will definitely enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

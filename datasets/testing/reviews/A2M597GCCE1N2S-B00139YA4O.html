<meta name="summary" content="40 "Lost" survivors....."></head><body><p>Lost is the great new show of 40 surviving plane crash people who end up on a deserted island somwhere in the Pacific Ocean. After leaving Sydney, Austrailia the plane crashes and the men and women are left to defend for their own. Of the dozen or so main characters there includes:<br /><br />A young doctor by the name of Jack who came to Austrailia to find his father who disappeared only to find out he died and wants to bring his body back for burial.<br /><br />A young woman by the name of Kate who is shown as a criminal with a mysterious past of running from the law.<br /><br />A sarcastic "Don't need help from anybody" man with the name of Sawyer. He tends to stick to robbing the wreckage of the plane for money and jewels in case they survive.<br /><br />A construction worker by the name of Michale who wants to build a raft to take him and his small son Walt to safety.<br /><br />An obese, yet really funny, lottery winner by the name of Hurley, who seems to think that he is a jynx.<br /><br />A young Japanese couple that cant speak English [Well, at least one of them can't]<br /><br />A musician by the name of Charlie [You might recognize him from Lord of the Rings] who is addicted to drugs.<br /><br />A young woman by the name of Claire who is nine or so months pregnant.<br /><br />A young man and his spoiled step sister.<br /><br />A very interesting character by the name of Jon Locke who was a handicap yet regains the feeling in his legs and learns the secret of the Island.<br /><br />And last but not least an Iraq Republican Guard by the name of Sayid. [My favorite character]<br /><br />While there are about 30 other survivors, the show tends to stick to the main group, but there are several episodes that show more survivors in the main stories.<br /><br />Besides the flashback episodes that show each and everyone's trouble past with that character shining in their own ways, there are also numerous plots that take place:<br /><br />From the raft being built and vandalism occuring, to another woman of a different group of survivors who has been on the island for 16+ years, to even the main plot of having a huge monster that you can never see, roaming in the forests.<br /><br />We dont see what the monster looks like but we can certainly hear what it sounds like in several of the episodes. However the monster doesn't appear in all the episdoes, in fact, he actually disappears for several weeks worth of episodes and only untill the secret of the island is starting to come into the story does he make his return.<br /><br />There are also the big, big mysteries of a hatch found in the middle of the woods that is extremely hard to open, and also the mystery of a group of other people who are living in the woods and wants to kill the survivors. Both these two mysteries added to the suspense of the last episdoe, as the hatch was finally opened and the strange people finally showed up.<br /><br />The episodes are really powerful, and some are even more captivating than others. I find that the shows that revolve around Locke, Sayid, and Sawyer are the best ones, especially with Locke. This show was great, can't wait for the realease, and I definately reccomend you watch the second season.</p></body></html>

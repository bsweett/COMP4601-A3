<meta name="summary" content="Scary and Effective"></head><body><p>Taking place 28 weeks after the events in "28 Days Later", "28 Weeks Later" is a good sequel that is hobbled a bit by knowing how the infected act, react, what they do, and how they do it.<br /><br />That's to be expected.  After all, we know who Batman is, and what powers Superman has, yet there is potential for a very good film to be made from familiar material.<br /><br />Several people have mentioned the huge plot holes.  For instance, here is a woman who has survived for 28 weeks, yet is infected.  Somehow, she is immune to the ravages of the 'Rage' virus, yet is a carrier.  That's possible (see 'Typhoid Mary').  This is the only person ever discovered to have this trait (at least so far).  Yet they strap her into a bed...and disappear!  No patient in real life is strapped into a bed and then just ignored.  And this is no regular patient.  She may represent a cure for a terrible, terrible disease.<br /><br />And then there is the question, why bring back people at all?  They bring something like 15,000 people back, put them on an island, connected by bridges loosely guarded, and expect nothing to happen?  Why not wait for, say, a couple of years?  Or, perhaps, until they discover a cure for the virus, or a vaccine?<br /><br />OK, the premise of the movie is what it is.  The question is, is the movie worth seeing?  I'd say YES.<br /><br />It's scary.  We know what the infected are capable of.  The can do superhuman feats of destruction, trying to kill whatever they can kill.  They are gruesome, they are bloody, they are fast, and they are uncontrollable.<br /><br />The movie made me jump several times, and held my interest during the entire film.<br /><br />The movie is all the more frightening when you consider that we have a threat that is facing us right now, that is all too real - bird flu.  The bad thing?  The incubation period is not seconds as it is with the rage flu (handy to tell if your patient is now infected), but days or perhaps weeks.  The infection could spread around the world before we even know it is there.<br /><br />Be afraid.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is recommended.  BTW, the extra features on the DVD are interesting and informative.  All of the actors playing the infected have dance backgrounds, and their movements were carefully choreographed.</p></body></html>

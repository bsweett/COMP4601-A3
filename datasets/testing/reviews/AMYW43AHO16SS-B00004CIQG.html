I thought Kubrick's use of humor to highlight the absurdity of nuclear war was quite effective.  It was rather challenging to make fun of a nuclear crisis.  But at the end of the film, you realize that it absolutely can happen if there are a few kooks who are running the show.  Well Recommended!!</p></body></html>

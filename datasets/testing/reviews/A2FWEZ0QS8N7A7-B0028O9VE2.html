<meta name="summary" content="Pay Attention to Your Spouse/Partner"></head><body><p>The title of this review is advice that works on several levels.  In my case, I was enthusiastic about seeing Spanglish and my wife was not.  We went, bad decision.  In the case of the movie, Adam Sandler is America's greatest working chef -- hey, I didn't believe it either, but the New York Times review everyone reads hungrily in the movie says so -- and St. John to everyone (and especially Flor and his daughter Bernice, particularly well-played by Sarah Steele) but his wife with whom he never talks.  Now admittedly she is bipolar -- half the time a harping shrew and the other half some sort of New Age physical fitness addict who constantly screams "Left, left" to people she is passing as she jogs, as if they're going to commit some kamikaze leap into her path.  One hopes Tea Leoni has replaced the agent who steered her to this part, where among other things she is required to be made up to look like a 20 years younger version of Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />And why is this movie so interminably long, over two hours to reach its two banal lessons -- 1) be true to your roots and 2) you need to work continually at your relationship.  Which leads back to ... pay attention to your spouse/partner if s/he says not to see this movie.</p></body></html>

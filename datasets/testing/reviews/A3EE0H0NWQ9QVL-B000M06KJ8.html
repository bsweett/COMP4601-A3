<meta name="summary" content="'Marie Antoinette' Rocks"></head><body><p>'Marie Antoinette' tries to do with it's subject matter what 'Amadeus' did for Mozart.  This playful rendition is done reflectively by the artful hand of director Sofia Coppola who through Kirsten Dunst gives us a sympathetic portrayal.  Being the olive branch from and for Austria, Marie's acquisition as the queen of France takes on a whole new meaning.  Since her young husband King Louis XVI is more interested in hunting than consummating their marriage, she fails to live up to her role of providing a successor--for a consequentially long time.  She drowns her sorrows through the morning ritual, complete with courtiers who dote on every morning whim, including champagne, sumptuous food, and a large appetite for extravagant confections.  All the details are done in stunning detail, even if Ms. Coppola stops to reflect too long and too often.  Their dereliction is not entirely apparent to them, but is solidified when Louis, ironically, decides to fund the American Revolution at his expense--in more ways than one.  Once her appetite for gambling and jewels is solidified, it is hard to retract its effects on long bread lines and excruciating poverty.  The repercussions creep up on them, making the audience feel its blind-siding impact from the couples' point-of-view.  In order for the film to work, we have to sympathize with the protagonists, and at first we do.  For throwing away decorum, she charitably introduces applause at the opera, and quickly and easily freezes all need for new jewelry.  The classical and rock music accentuate the scenes, and, while it may seem misplaced for the latter, we realize how much of a tragic misfit she may have been in the royal scheme of things.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />'Marie Antoinette' is a stylish, if not overlong, new look at a colorful, misunderstood famous figure.  Usually personified as arrogance itself, she shrugged off being misunderstood and let's us know that she did not indeed say, "Let them eat cake" afterall.  Whether revisionism or not, this film is interesting in its own right.</p></body></html>

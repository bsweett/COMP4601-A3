Disatisfaction abounds with the super wealthy, here they are, they have everything money can buy, trophy wife, yacht, servants, 3 or 4 homes around the world a garage full of cars.  And yet, they still want more.  What they really want is satisfaction and inner peace.  And that is gotten thru spiritually.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

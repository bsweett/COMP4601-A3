<meta name="summary" content="Nicely restored version of Ford's classic western with one of John Wayne's best performances"></head><body><p>The impact of "The Searchers" and its influence is undisputed all you have to do is watch any of Sergio Leone's westerns or even "Silverado" (a love letter to Ford and Hawks' westerns). I'll admit I wasn't much of a John Wayne fan growing up but he gives a marvelous performance here as the hardened soldier Ethan who returns to his brother's Texas home after serving in the Civil War. When his neices Debbie & Lucy are kidnapped by the Commanche and the rest of his brother's family brutally murdered, Ethan with Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) who he rescued as a boy and Lucy's boyfriend Brad take off in pursuit in hopes of saving the girls and taking revenge.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Vera Miles ("Psycho"), Natalie Wood and Ward Bond.<br /><br />Beautifully shot in Monument Valley (among other places), Ford's film looks marvelous in this digital restoration. Shot in the Vista Vision process, the print they've used here looks clean with colors that pop.<br /><br />Extras include a commentary by director/writer/Ford biographer Peter Bogdonvich, as 1998 documentary on the production of the film narrated by John Millius, a new featurette on the film, an introduction by actor Patrick Wayne (who appears in the film)and vintage footage from the Warner "Behind the Cameras" TV series. We also get the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />"The Searchers" is a product of its time (including the acting)so keep that in mind if you are coming to this after watching films made in the late 20th century or early 21st. It's a marvelous film, beautifully shot.</p></body></html>

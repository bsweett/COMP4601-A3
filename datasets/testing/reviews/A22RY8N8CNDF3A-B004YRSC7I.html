<meta name="summary" content="Complex, Confusing Story on Revenge and Remembering -"></head><body><p>This is a intricate crime story, and somewhat confusing to watch.  The main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce)  has lost his short-term memory.  His long-term memory is intact.  He can remember details and everything that happened before his "accident", but cannot retain what he has done or said five or ten minutes after doing anything (anterograde amnesia).  He is unsure of who to trust, who are his friends, what is true and his only goal is revenge, finding the man who raped and murdered his wife.  He is focused only on justice.<br /><br />He is well-built, thin, handsome, wearing expensive suits, driving an expensive jaguar, but lives in ratty, run-down motels, paying cash for all he wants.  He is a former insurance investigator, very aware of his handicap, explaining to people in great detail why he has trouble knowing them or remembering what he told them.  He has to rely on others, his index cards, photos, and skin tattoos to latch on to his past thoughts and observations.<br /><br />Leonard has psychological issues as he fights and struggles to interpret the evidence he finds and keeps on index cards and hiding places.  The film starts from the endpoint, the murder of "Teddy" known as John Edward Gammell.  The film re-winds and stalls in the present at times -  it is complex and confusing to refigure the frames and realize how the meaning of events changes.  The bad and good criss-cross as the story unfolds.  It seems the color scenes are shown in reverse order and black and white are chronological.  The two sequences come together at the end of the film.<br /><br />Leonard meets a woman named Natalie after finding a note in his clothes.  Natalie at first is angry and resentful because she identifies Leonard with the clothes and car of her boyfriend Jimmy.  After being educated about Leonard's short-term memory she uses him to drive a threatening man out of town.  She offers to run the license plate on Leonard's latest tattoo to help in his investigation.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat of a surprise if you can figure out the movie's timeline.</p></body></html>

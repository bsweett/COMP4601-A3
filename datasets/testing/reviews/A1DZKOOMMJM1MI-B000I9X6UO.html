<meta name="summary" content="Intense!"></head><body><p>Phone Booth is a real nailbiter. An genuine edge-of-the-seat roller coaster ride brimming with non-stop suspence.<p>It certainly isn't the deepest of thrillers, and it has flaws in logic and presentation, but the idea behind it is a tension grabber: A man answers a phone in a phone booth only to be told that if he hangs up, he'll be shot by a gunman lurking in a nearby window. The man is Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), an obnoxious New York press agent. Stu, who is married, regularly uses this same phone booth to call a young client and would-be girlfriend (Katie Holmes, who isn't given much to do) because he doesn't want the number to show up on his cell-phone bill. But the calls - and lives - of those who use the phone booth somehow are being monitored by a man with a vengeance (Kiefer Sutherland). <p>Screenwriter Larry Cohen (It's Alive) has created a situation that so tense, you can overlook the thematic overreaching. Stu is forced into one double bind after another, with the Caller forcing him to make comments to his wife (Radha Mitchell) on the phone and to neighborhood strippers and cops on the street that only bolster the perception that Stu may be a gun-wielding menace. Director Joel Schumacher and Cohen keep the action taut and believable within its own self-contained world. Although the phone booth may confine Stu in uncomfortable ways, it has a liberating effect on Schumacher, who infuses his filmmaking with a no-nonsense energy to keep the story moving.<p>The movie definitely works, holding you to that screen like poor Stu is held in that booth. At 81 minutes, "Phone Booth" is a lean, mean tension machine, setting up its premise, executing it with smarts, throwing in enough twists to keep things interesting, and wrapping it up before anyone can get fatigued or reflective. It's a smart, edgy thriller that kept this viewer glued to his seat.</p></body></html>

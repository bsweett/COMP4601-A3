<meta name="summary" content="Funniest movie of 2006... by far, best I've seen in too long"></head><body><p>When Hollywood churns out crap by the dozens like "Wedding Crashers" and "Cheaper by the Dozen" and "Son of the Mask" and such, something like Borat is a welcome surprise.<br /><br />Controversy is definitely abound, as many people are offended when they shouldn't be; Borat doesn't intend to nastily mock or ridicule Americans or Kazakhs.  It pokes fun, in some cases more extreme than others, for our benefit.  If we're paying 8 and in some cases even 10 dollars to see a movie, we expect to see something hilarious!<br /><br />Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is raunchy, crass, and often the character Borat is racist and sexist, and yet it always makes you laugh.  While many laughs comes from Borat's statements and questions, many more come from the responses of the real life people involved, such as the scene where Borat asks a car dealer if he has a car good for running down gypsies.<br /><br />If you think it's not okay to make fun of anyone, you'll hate this movie.  And if you do, please don't trash it mindlessly.  The racous laughter stemming from the theaters this plays in is proof enough of its success.<br /><br />Even if short on plot, this movie is undoubtedly one of the best comedies I've seen in too many years, best of 2006 among the likes of Clerks II.</p></body></html>

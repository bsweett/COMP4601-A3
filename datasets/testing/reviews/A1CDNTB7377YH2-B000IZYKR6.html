<meta name="summary" content="Very Disturbing but Compelling to Watch!"></head><body><p>This movie is like Open Water, where there are only two actors in a situation that you know something terrifyingly awful is going to occur but you are compelled to watch anyway.  In this one a thirty-something man is trolling the Internet chat rooms looking for young girls.  He has a conversation with a 14 year old girl and they agree to meet.<br /><br />He tells the girl that he is a photographer that does a lot of work for magazines and the girl ends up at his house.  The first thing that the girl notices is there are photos of young girls lining the walls.  He gives her alcohol and she appears to be getting drunk but then the man starts getting ill and passes out.  When he wakes up he is tied to a chair and being interrogated by the girl.  She tries to get him to say something incriminating or help her to locate something incriminating in his house.  As soon as she finds something you know that something bad will happen.  The seamingly innocent 14 year old becomes a calculating vigilante metting out brutal justice.  It is at this point you want to stop the film but you are compelled to continue watching to find out what will happen (even though you already can guess what will happen).<br /><br />If you have a very weak mental constitution, this movie is not for you.  If nothing phases you than you will appreciate the incredible acting and the thrill of the shocking situation that the two are in.</p></body></html>

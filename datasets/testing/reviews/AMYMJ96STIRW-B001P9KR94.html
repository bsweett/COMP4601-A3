<meta name="summary" content="Visually stunning!?"></head><body><p>The main reason this was purchased was because it won an Academy Award and that the Amazon reviews said it was visually stunning.<br />It, to me was not! This is actually more of a documentary, which is fine if you like Blu-ray docs, which I don't.<br />This is a real-life showing of the misery of the human condition, that can be found anywhere, but in this case in India. Unless I can directly do something about it I'd rather not watch it. Children have and always will be abused - as will adults - until the end of time.<br />The acting was not particularly impressive and over-all this movie just reminded me once again of how we treat each other.<br />If a human being of any age is abused in any way, by any one, does it make any difference where it is happening, particularly if nothing is done to keep it from happening again!?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A legendary acting performance should be in your film library"></head><body><p>If you have not seen Charlize Theron 'channel' Aileen Wuornos in the film Monster, you are in for an amazing film experience. This performance by Theron will become legendary, much like Robert DeNero's legendary acting in Raging Bull. Let me explain why I found this film to be exceptional: When I read a book or see a film, I watch for the manner in which the writer,director, and actors portray the characters.  The more justice shown and compassion shown, generally the more I like the work. I am not  convinced of pure evil or pure charity or pure innocenence or pure revenge. Charlize Theron allows us to see the terribly twisted youth and adolescence of Aileen, the series of bad breaks and miscalculations, and yet we also see her crimes as unnecessary, especially all her murders after the first murder. She did kill a sadistic rapist in self defense in her first homocide, but unfortunately this melts into a series of murders. It is when a good Samaratan type of family man picks her up thinking that she is really a person in need of help, and circumstances come together so that Aileen chooses to kill him also, that we see her final sentence is just and we can leave the end of the film with a sense of closure.<br /><br />Christina Ricci plays the lost lesbian girl that was Eileen's partner in these final months and during the murder spree. She does a good job of playing the rebellious teenager, rebelling against any boundaries and yet dependent on the adult world for her meals and clothing and shelter.<br /><br />The film will make you sad and maybe even angry. I become angry when I think about the physical and sexual mistreatment of children and how these experiences may destroy a life course or life path. I felt real compassion for Aileen but also for her victims. Well made, well acted, excellent film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No sequel please!"></head><body><p>You will love this movie if: 1.  You were a major fan of the TV show. 2.  You love stop-action fight sequences. 3.  You are a fan of Diaz, Liu, or Barrymore.<p>Otherwise, this movie is only average.  Good for a rent.  Somewhat entertaining.</p></body></html>

At least you always know what you are going to get with him. LOL. Plot? Totally predictable but enjoyable anyway. Audience? Male, 20+ years. Not a date movie or to be watched with a female. Oh, there is a token female but not much more than that: token. Watched more than once? Barely, as not non-stop action.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprised even ME"></head><body><p>Since this is a Disney movie I skipped its theatrical run. I've seen most Pixar productions and they've all been fair, if not a bit too family-oriented for me. So after the gobs and gobs of good press (and it being directed by Iron Giant's Bird) I bought it on a whim. My reaction? AMAZING!! I LOVE the glorious art direction, the sheer DETAIL, the frenetic action sequences are dazzling and had me gasping for air, the casting (especially the always wonderful Holly Hunter), the inventiveness and creativity...it was TOTALLY thrilling. The feared "family" themes - what kept me away from the theater in the first place - were kept in check and not overdone. Not only that but Sam Jackson - once again - gives yet ANOTHER great performance. It's presented in 2.40:1 widescreen, which is a perfect choice. It is so cool to see animated features being given the "scope" treatment - I hope it's a trend that continues. This may be the best looking dvd I've ever seen. On my OLD Sony, it damn near passes for HD-quality, with some of the most stunning clarity and image detail I've ever seen. Particularly mind-blowing are all of the chase scenes, which were flat-out MESMERIZING. Needless to say, I WILL BE THERE when a sequel comes out!!</p></body></html>

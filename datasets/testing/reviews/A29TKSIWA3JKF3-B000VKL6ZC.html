Sad and boring is another way of looking at it.  The prolog went on forever, reveling in and glorifying domestic abuse.  The argument being, I suppose, that all this RAGE on the home front and in school is what made Michael Myers become an unholy monster.  If that doesn't demystify Carpenter's creation, everything that follows does.  Zombie has managed to do the unthinkable; he's turned an icon of horror into a sniveling creature of banality.  Then he populated his film with strange casting choices that came off as crazy inside jokes: Udo Kier and Clint Howard!<br /><br />A pointless exercise in mismanagement, never mind any real filmmaking skills.</p></body></html>

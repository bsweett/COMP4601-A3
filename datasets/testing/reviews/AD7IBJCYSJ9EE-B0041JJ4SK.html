When I first heard of it, I was like, "Seems like a long ad for White Castle to me." But I watched it in theatres anyway! And I loved it!<br /><br /> THE STORY: Harold and Kumar are two stoner roomates. Harold is an Asain dude who has a crush on a girl named Maria, and Kumar is an Indian guy who likes weed. One day they see an ad for White Castle and get hungry! So they drive over there, running into hilarious obstacles along the way!<br /><br /> As you see, it's not a serious movie, but it's fun! The DVD is also sweet! Oh, BTW, the sequel, "Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam" is coming soon!</p></body></html>

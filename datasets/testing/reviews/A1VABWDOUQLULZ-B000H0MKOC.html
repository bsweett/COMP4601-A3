Tragic in the right lighting. I did not know what to expect of it, and it did not go in the direction I thought it would. Likely that means it went in a better direction, as the crux of it begins and remains that it's not what you say but how you say it. Given that, this film shows great insight into rhetoric, which is poignant data about our entire means of distributing "information" at present.</p></body></html>

The distance that Oswald had to shoot from was considered 'Expert range'.  Oswald was not a prize marksman.  And he was using a mediocre weapon.  They had experts shoot the same distance with the same type of gun and they could barely make the shot on 90% of the attempts.  Oliver Stone's depiction is riveting, no doubt, but I'm sure he takes plenty of liberties.  He is liberal as hell and loves to create controversy.  The movie is still full of real facts, including the reaction of Kennedy's body when he was shot and the muzzle flash from the knoll.  THERE WAS DEFINITELY ANOTHER PERSON SHOOTING AT KENNEDY'S CAR.  There are other facts that raise a lot of questions as well.  The route of the motorcade, Oswalds motive, Ruby's death.  If you want to create an opinion, get information from more than one source.  This debate has been going on for a long time and we know there have been cover ups and undisclosed information.  Posner's book is most likely a jaded and one sided opinion.  The movie is fantastic, it makes you ask a lot of questions.  Good performances, one of Costner's best, with a very good accent.  John Candy makes a suprising and impressive dramatic turn.  All others; Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldman all contribute greatly and make this a facinating movie based on historical fact.  No movie should be confused with a history lesson.  That's why I gave it four stars.</p></body></html>

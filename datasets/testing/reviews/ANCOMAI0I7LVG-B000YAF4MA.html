Very rarely do they star two juggernaut actors like Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.  Very rarely are they this devoid of merit.  I'm bewildered at how poorly conceived this film was, when you consider the names involved.  I really wanted to see this.  Sure, it looked corny and unappealing on the outset, but it also stars one of the greatest actors ever (Nicholson) and one of the more understated and nuanced of his generation (Freeman), so the possibilities were endless here.  Instead of challenging these two men to provide us with something insightful and profound, we are left with a film that casts Nicholson as the loudmouthed jerk and Freeman as the quietly sincere `wise' soul.  Seriously, why are such great actors relegated to playing the same character in every film?  Why couldn't Nicholson be the quiet one for a change?  Why can't we see Morgan Freeman boss people around and show lack of personal regard for everyone around him?  I just want something to differentiate this from the last dozen movies these two have starred in.  YUCK.  Seriously, this is saccharine to the hilt, and the forced upon comedic aspects feel redundant and underwhelming.  Thankfully, even when handed the same boring predictable loaf of a character these actors seem to do their best with the role, so they make it at least somewhat watchable (they have great chemistry), but this is a generic story with no arc that isn't 100% predictable.  I just want to slap someone in the face right now.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slumdog Millionaire"></head><body><p>I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this movie but it runs the gamut of emotions. A poor boy from the slums of India manages to get onto a  trivia game show just like "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" with Howie Mandel. As he gets closer and closer to the multi-million jackpot we see his life played out before us. He has endured many things since childhood, mostly torment including his mothers death. The one light of his life is a girl he met when he was young. Most of the movie reflects his trying to track her down after their separation. Good drama and good production. Good quality DVD with a few features. Decent replayability.

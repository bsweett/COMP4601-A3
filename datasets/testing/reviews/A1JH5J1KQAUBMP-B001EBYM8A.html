<meta name="summary" content="Classic action flick"></head><body><p>Wrongly accused of his wife's murder, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) hunts for the true killer, a mysterious one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas), with a U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) and his team hot on his heels.<br /><br />Director Andrew Davis keeps things moving and Ford and Jones are both riveting in their roles.  A few of Dr. Kimble's escapes strain credulity, but the film never fails to entertain and the finale is very satisfying.</p></body></html>

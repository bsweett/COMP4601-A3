The characters were a bit hard to relate to but it was good acting.  Robert DeNiro plays a very intense character, whose personality takes a little twist.  Not everything is completely believable in the film, but it kept me on the "edge of my seat."<br /><br />Dakota Fanning is amazing.  I don't know how a little girl can act so many horrifying scenes like those.  She must be able to separate herself from what she is acting.  This film is definitely not appropriate for children.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What WAS this?!"></head><body><p>I read Matheson's book prior to seeing the movie.  Watching the movie, I felt like "what story am I watching here?!"  The ending, the girl's role, the whole thing was changed. There was a tiny bit of the essence of Matheson's book, but the stunning quality of I AM LEGEND is it's ending.  Why is he legend. Will Smith was awesome and he carried me through the movie. But what a disappointment overall.</p></body></html>

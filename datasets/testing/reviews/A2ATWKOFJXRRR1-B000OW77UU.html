<meta name="summary" content="A Tale Of Two Struggles: Fatherhood And Financial"></head><body><p>If you're not a feel-good person, it's still okay to watch THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS. Although it has some of those moments, it stands out more as a story of human struggle than a touchy-feely film. That it's based on the real-life events of Chris Gardner also increases its emotional heft as the story pulls you in. But there is a bit of cheating that must be mentioned....<br /><br />Most of the story's impact comes from the father/son relationship between Chris (Will Smith, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) and his son Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). The interactions between these two are so natural and effortless that it makes watching the film a sheer joy. But herein lay the trap. If any other young actor had played beside Will Smith, I don't think it would've come off as easy. But one can't blame the film team for making this decision. Jaden Smith was the perfect choice, no matter how unfair it might seem to other father/son film's that struggle with the easy-going nature of similar characters.<br /><br />Viewing one man's dogged determination to maintain a functioning relationship with his son would be admirable in today's society no matter what. Especially coming from a financially destitute and broken family. That Chris Gardner refused to give up on his dream of becoming a successful father and businessman is felt throughout the movie as Will Smith's Academy Award nominated performance comes tumbling off the screen. Losing everything only to scramble back up and be repeatedly challenged is nothing new to cinema, but Smith's completely believable performance is something of a wonder. The real Chris Gardner put himself on loan to Smith and the production so that everything had that authentic feel. It also meant that there were fewer liberties taken with the story, as Gardner wouldn't allow certain omissions or changes.<br /><br />The big surprise, though, was Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. His corny jokes, tickle-fests, vivid imagination (dinosaurs?), and touching dialogue all moved the story into brighter territory during the darkest times. Thandie Newton (CRASH) also plays well as Smith's alienated wife but has little screen time.<br /><br />Learning to never give up on your dreams is something we can all take to the bank. And Mr. Gardner certainly did. He's now a multimillionaire who's assisting the poor in the very San Francisco neighborhood where this sobering story takes place. Giving back to the homeless shelters and getting notice out about hunger in our own cities, Chris Gardner is not only a success, he's smart and thoughtful. If for no other reason than that, you should watch The Pursuit of Happyness.<br /><br />(Note: At the very end of the film, the real Chris Gardner has a cameo spot while wearing a very expensive suit. The film makers did this in order to show how far the Mr. Gardner had come.)</p></body></html>

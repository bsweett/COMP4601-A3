<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Spin-Off"></head><body><p>This movie is a spin off from the Mummy.  They've done a good job with the concept.  There is a good story line that keeps you wondering how is this going to work out.  The characters are believable and likeable.  It is a fun entertaining picture, something you can watch several times over.</p></body></html>

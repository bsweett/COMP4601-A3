Thus, I had to watch it a few times before I could really appreciate this film for what it is...a tale of two buddies in the last days of their friendship before one of them gets married off. First, let me say that if you haven't read the novel and you love this film, then I hope you will buy and read the novel. There were so many amusing scenes left out, which only added to my disappointment upon first viewing...but I understand that they had to cut a lot of things out to keep the film to a decent running time.<br /><br />This film has plenty going for it: a fine cast, a great and complimentary soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, awesome location, and a clever script. Unfortunately, the story shows a rather unsavory side to men, which I hope women won't think ALL MEN have some compulsary need to have one last affair before getting married. Both men are rather pathetic and its surprising that they have remained friends for so long (from freshmen in college through middle age). Paul Giamattie is simply great in his role as an introverted loser who lacks confidence with women and tends to go to the dark side of pessimistic outlook. He has a great sparring partner in Thomas Harden Church, who plays an extroverted, womanizing lout with a diminishing acting career. In the Santa Ynez valley on a wine tasting tour, hanging out at the Windmill Motel near the Danish tourist town of Solvang, they meet two ladies and begin their unique ways of flirtation. Thomas plays the more confident one of the two and quickly has Stephanie (Sandra Oh) wanting to get jump in the sack with him. The scenes between Paul and Virginia Madsen are the best in the film...as their dialogue about life and using wine as a metaphor represents a cool style of flirtation. Paul's character simply is slower when it comes to attracting women, and its interesting to hear Virginia comparing the quality of a wine and when it begins its decline. Is she talking about wine or him? She's brilliant and the best thing about this film.<br /><br />The scene I didn't like, however, comes near the end of their sojourn when Jack (Thomas Harden Church) begs his friend to retrieve an important item left at a one night stand's house. Although that scene was in the book...I was shocked by what they actually show the audience. It does add a bit of humor (on the gross-out side) but I thought it was unnecessary. Because of that scene, I couldn't recommend this film to many people I'd otherwise recommend it to (their sensibilities would not find much humor in it). Other than that...it was a good film. For those who like or love this film, I would recommend you to read the novel by Rex Pickett. It is so much better and you'll gain a fuller appreciation for the characters. Plus, the film made some changes in the beginning and the ending, as well as changing Stephanie from the novel's character of "Terra". So, buy the soundtrack to listen to as you read the novel, sipping a glass of Pinot Noir...and get ready for a belly full of laughs!</p></body></html>

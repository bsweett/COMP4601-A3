A T-Virious starts to infect all the employees down their and turn them into zombies. A woman who can't remember anything was caputred by a cop until some guys in uniforms broke in and grabed the cop they took her and the cop down the hive to shut the hole place down, it turns out that they ran into some trouble by kill the zombies if they don't want to get bitten and become one. This first is not so much base on the video game like the second movie is but it is a lot more blooder which I like.</p></body></html>

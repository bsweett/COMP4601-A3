The acting, the story, and definitely the music work very well and make this movie incredible. You hear about his life, but it is a different thing when you watch it. Once again, the actors were fantastic and everyone fit their role perfectly. R.Patrick was great as John's dad, he isn't given enough credit, but he did a great job in his role. Overall, great...get this movie!</p></body></html>

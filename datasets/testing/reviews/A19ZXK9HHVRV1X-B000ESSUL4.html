<meta name="summary" content="hypnotic and mesmerizing work of art"></head><body><p>When you see Terrence Malick's "The New World," you feel as if you are watching an exquisite poem coming to life on the big screen.  This achingly beautiful work is only the fourth film in over thirty years by Malick, one of the least prolific and most talented directors in American movies.  As with his previous films, "Badlands," Days of Heaven" and "The Thin Red Line," Malick eschews storyline and action for artistry and mood.<br /><br />"The New World" is a haunting evocation of that moment when two alien cultures met for the first time face to face.  The year is 1607 and a fleet of ships dispatched by King James of England arrives on the shores of North America to establish a new settlement called (what else?) Jamestown.  There to greet them is a beautiful young Indian princess known to us as Pocahontas who winds up captivating and falling in love with John Smith, the future leader of the settlement.  Along with the expected clash of cultures, Malick showcases the heartbreaking story of two people who fall in love but are ultimately kept apart by their differences.<br /><br />Nobody captures the sheer exquisiteness of the natural landscape better than Malick, and every shot here is a masterpiece of composition, form and lighting.  Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has wrought endless miracles with his camera in terms of both movement and the framing of his subjects.  Although the film is extremely studied and slow-moving, it is never static or boring, so enthralled are we by what it is showing us.  Malick reminds us here that for all the advancements made in the art of special effects, it is good old-fashioned photography that can really make the jaw drop and the eye pop when it is done this well.  Moreover, Malick has used natural sound beautifully, weaving it into the fabric of his love story, much as he has done with the exquisite and haunting musical score composed by James Horner ("Titanic").<br /><br />Even though the characters say little to one another - much of the dialogue comes in the form of voiceover recitations of journal entries or interior monologues - the filmmaker is able to convey romantic yearning with extraordinary force, primarily through facial expressions, bodily movements and lyrical camerawork.  As Smith, Collin Farrell provides just the right combination of brooding introspection and wistful tender-heartedness to make the romance work.  15-year-old newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher turns Pocahontas into an almost ethereal presence, perfectly matching the dreamlike nature of the film.<br /><br />It would appear that the Motion Picture Academy has chosen to snub this film in most of the major categories (with the exception of cinematography).  What a shame, for even though some people might dismiss "The New World" as just Art with a capital "A," this is actually one of the most enthralling and cinematically beautiful films of recent times.  It has the rare ability to transport you to a different world and leave you aching for more.</p></body></html>

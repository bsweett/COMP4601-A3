The nature of the zombie/vampires was not well explored, particularly the clear demonstration of their vestigial intelligence and apparent social organization. The film just kind of gallumphs to a close.  I would also have to agree with criticisms of the sometimes-chunky CGI; thi sis the first film I've ever saw that I actually thought, gee, it wouldn't be so bad if at some future date they went back and retouched some of the computer graphics. Much of it was surprisingly cheesy.  Will Smith does a good job in his role -- loved the dog, as well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue)</p></body></html>

Both work at successful everyday jobs. Or so they think. The movie opens with the Smiths sitting on a couch being questioned about their marriage by a psychologist who we never see (but is played by William Fichtner: Invasion, The Perfect Storm, Armageddon). When John and Jane met they had instant chemistry, drinking themselves blind and making out in the rain. After a few weeks they tied the knot. "Five or six" years later they fell into the suburb routine of getting up, going to work, having dinner and very little (if any) sex.<br /><br />They have both perfected their skills as liars and as deadly assassins. They botch a mutual job and in so doing learn that the other is also a hired killer. Even though they both lied, each feels deceived by the other but their relationship is the least of their problems. Because of this botch they have 48 hours to clean up the mess. Part of the mess involves getting rid of the other spouse. Sparks begin flying along side the many bullets they rain on one another.<br /><br />Right from the beginning I was laughing at their interaction between Jolie and Pitt. They are very funny, even when they are working (killing people, which sounds horrendous). The nattering between these two is reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. A few of the violent scenes with them kicking one another's butts made me wince, but overall were tolerable. Fun movie. I'm looking forward to seeing it again.</p></body></html>

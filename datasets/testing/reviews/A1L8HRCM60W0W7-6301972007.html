<meta name="summary" content="A DAZZLING "JACKIE BROWN" FROM THE 40s"></head><body><p>A noir works best when it is fueled by the characters within it. Maltese Falcon could almost be a textbook example of how to achieve that.<br /><br />A pitch-perfect, credible plot with more twists than an Elvis concert sits atop a taut script that creates bizarre characterizations from ear-bending conversations.<br /><br />All of which are brought together to create a darkly intriguing world whose selfish players cannot get enough trying to screw each other over.<br /><br />Highly recommended classic that stands up to repeat viewings. Everything you expect from a riveting mystery yarn, and more.</p></body></html>

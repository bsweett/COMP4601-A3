<meta name="summary" content="It was good....."></head><body><p>.....and thats it. It was'nt spectacular or nothing amazing, not even great, but it was good. I am a big fan of Zombie movies and have 40 or so on DVD, so I would consider my judgement pretty solid. Having the original Night Of The Living Dead, dawn of the dead ( the Original) plus the 4 disc box set, day of the dead ( 2 disc edition) and the new crappy/garbage Dawn Of The Dead ( not done by Romero ). I am a fan of Romero Zombie flicks. I would like to do as best as I can and go threw detail about what ever I can.<br /><br />The Acting- Well for 15 Mill you kow what your getting, ofcourse its good.<br /><br />The Gore- Was definitly there and I was definitly happy, if not for a worlld wide release probably would have been bloodier. Also like the fact that they show the Zombies feasting on people plenty of times. Which is what Zombie flicks these days forget to do ( EX. 28 days later and Dawn Of The Dead 2004 ).Thats what really makes the Zombie a Zombie.<br /><br />The Scenery- Well done. This whole movie takes place at night which I love. To make a Zombie movie, the only way is to do it at night. The scenery is pretty creepy. the way they divide the land is also well done kind of like the zombies on one side and  the other community of people. You are Either rich( high Class) or poor ( low class )no inbetween.<br /><br />Spcl FX- They are excellent, my personal favorite is the girl in the soccer jersey, she plays an excellent Zombie make up and acting, she does great, the Butcher is also good. Big Daddy's make up is horrible. He dont even look like a Zombie except for some rotted teeth. but overall the Fx are excellent the Zombies all look good the gore fx are all good and to an extent very real looking.I dont know who did the effects, I thought it was KNB but when reading the credits it says Greg Nicotero , so im not sure either way the effects are top notch, besides a couple animated parts.<br /><br />BIG DADDY -  The most annnoying , all he does is grunt moan and cry, yes cry in his own way. He walks like a person, acts like a person and doesnt even look like a Zombie. My girlfirend and i were watching and after seeing hima couple times she was like " he dont even semm like aZombie, and that he is annnoying ", which besides her and me plenty of people think so, read the reviews. he is I guess you could say the leader and genius of the bunch.<br /><br />Zombies_- NO THEY DONT RUN, THANK GOD. They are not as slow as the orignal Zombies, but still are very slow but can move slightly better. Now what is pretty cool is the idea that these Zombies are starting to understand how to do thinnks at a real level that they are getting intellegent after being around so long, watching and learning. Makes it a but more challenging for the people that live in the city.<br /><br />The plot- Very good and solid like th idea's that Romero has and uses. Does a great job.<br /><br />Directing and Editing- is all done great also no complaints.<br /><br />The Ending- Well I wont spoil it and say what happens, all i know is there will most likely be another part, probably called "World of the dead"or maybe even just "Dead Reckoning" and I say Dead Reckoning because the way the movie ends , when you see you will understand. Basically one of the last lines of the movie made by Riley is pretty silly and i was just not really understanding why he did what he did, but overall not a bad ending I think it should have been a bit different or maybe better but it was still ok.<br /><br />  Basically Horror movies in general have changed these days. Its hard to find a real good one. The new generations are coming up and in much of a sense things have to be made to appeal to the newer set of fans while occasinallly not forgetting about the old school fans of 70's and 80's horror like myself. While IMO horror was at its best, as soon as the 1968 NOTLD was made that opened doors for everything and everyone. And with no question marks Romero does satisy everyone , I know i was satisfied.<br /><br />Its a movie well worth to see and when it comes out on DVD I will own it becuase it is a Romero Zombie flick, and will have to complete my set, plus dont get me wrong definitley worth the buy and the money for me atleast. If you are a die hard fan of Zombie flciks and have seen them all( from Romero to Fulci etc...) basically you will understand and appreciate where Romero is coming from and what his ideas are. and they are definitly good. I still love the stupid mindless slow moving human/flesh eating Zombies ,but times are changing so must everything else. Go see "Land of the Dead"  you should enjoy it, I did.<br /><br />This is the longest review i ever written.</p></body></html>

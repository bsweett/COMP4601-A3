She plays older sister Rose to a very messed up 'party girl' Cameron Diaz (Maggie). Maggie gives the line; 'You only hurt the ones you love' deeper jabs as she sabotages her own life and her sister's. But family bonds are never truly broken in this movie, and when Diaz discovers she has a grandmother (Maclaine), their past with a mentally ill mother becomes clearer to all of the women. Once they are able to sift through some childhood shadows, Maggie realizes that Rose has been her protector all her life. I found it interesting that the film brought out how the adolescent mind can 'tone down' tragic moments. This movie has soul, and though my husband dubbed it as a 'slight' chick flick, he enjoyed watching as well.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

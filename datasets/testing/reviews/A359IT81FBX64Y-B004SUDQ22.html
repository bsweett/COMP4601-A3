<meta name="summary" content="Proof that good actors and good acting = bad movie"></head><body><p>What is this movie about, really? Is it like the Amazon reviewer says, "advanced academia, revelations of love, fear, regret, and potential recovery"? Maybe, but I don't think so. This film deliberately toys with its audience so we can't get a fix on whether Catherine is crazy or sane, skittish or companionable, a liar or a saint, brilliant or dull. At the end we find out, but we're given a lot of false scents until then. So maybe it works as a kind of academia thriller, but for me the thrill was gone.<br /><br />To me it seems the story is more about the challenges and ethical issues surrounding the care of ill parents. How much should children be expected to sacrifice to provide a "dignified" life for their parents? But this story falls far short of answering that question, too.</p></body></html>

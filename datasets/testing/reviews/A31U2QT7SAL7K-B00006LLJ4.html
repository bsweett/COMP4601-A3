That aside, what will this audience see?  <p>Well, they will find a typical summer flick filled with the ingredients for success: special effects, an easy-to-follow and well-crafted plot, cliffhanger situations, familial bonds (This IS a Spielberg film!), political intrigue, and mysterious characters.<p>What more could you want?<p>John Williams has composed one of his best scores in years, a deft combination of the adventurous and the haunting.<p>As far as the performances are concerned, Cruise, as John Anderton, is appropriately heroic, adept at self-preservation, and fit, figuratively and literally, for the tasks brought upon him. Newcomer Samantha Morton is sympathetic as the individual that holds the key to Cruise's future. However, acting nods must go to two veterans, Max von Sydow and Lois Smith.  <p>Sydow portrays Lamar Burgess, Cruise's mentor and the co-developer of the Precog system.  The actor balances the sincere and the menacing with the talent that only years on the screen can give.  Smith is Lois Hineman, the other half of the development team.  Although her on-screen time is brief, she paints a memorable canvas as she provides Cruise's character with important information that can save his hide.<p>These two performers show that the young have nothin on the "old school playas".</p></body></html>

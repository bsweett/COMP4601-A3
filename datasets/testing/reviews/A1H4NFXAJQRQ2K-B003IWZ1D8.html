<meta name="summary" content="Buy It"></head><body><p>One of my favorite Blu-ray purchases. The movie is a classic in so many ways and holds up after all these years. It lives up to it's title, a true psycho killer classic that set new standards in film soundtrack/scoring, cinematography and overall suspense. Undeniable style and one of Hitchcock's best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best film of the Summer"></head><body><p>Up is a great film and defiantly ranks as one of Pixar's best- as well as one of the best animated films of the last ten years.  The only films that can compare are Pixar's Wall-E and The Incredibles.  The film is just a pure delight and one of the most mature films to come from the company that is without a doubt the most consistently entertaining studio in all of Hollywood.  It was easily the most mature, well thought out film I viewed during the 2009 Summer Movie Season, and I'm sure it will be considered one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Story:  The story is one that has the light-hearted fantasy feel of a children's movie, while at the same time retaining the dark elements of an adult tale of obsession and greed.  Its plot is a very complex analysis about the passion of love, loss, and obsession and I was fascinated every-single second.  But, I should warn parents, behind the cute old man and the flying house this is ranks up with The Incredibles as one of the darkest films to receive the PG rating within the states.<br /><br />The story is about an old man who, after the death of his wife, lives a lonely, uneventful wife.  After assaulting a construction worker he is deemed a threat to the community and is told that he shall be removed from his home and forced into a retirement community.  With little choice he chooses to fulfill the dream that him and his spouse shared of placing their home near Paradise Falls in South America.<br /><br />Using thousands of helium filled balloons he begins this expedition, but along the way he is joined by many unexpected companions, ranging from a determined scout, a talking dog, and a large exotic bird.  In the end he is forced to decide what matters most in life.<br /><br />The film is modeled after the serials of the 1930s-1950s and carries along that fun, adventurous spirit throughout.<br /><br />Animation:  It's Pixar, what do you expect?  As usual it is top of the line and obviously had long hours of emotional effort put into it.  The animators for Pixar never seem fed-up with their jobs and always deliver the best.<br /><br />Voices:  Voice-acting is also top of the line.  Every voice actor is clearly treating the role seriously and having a fun time doing it.<br /><br />I highly recommend Up to children and adults- heck, I would recommend the movie to an adult, regardless of whether or not they had children.  It's just that good of a movie that it transcends age groups to be the most widely appealing film of the summer.<br /><br />Up emotionally compelling and full of fun with endless imagination.  It certainly deserves a rental and a space in your home movie collection to enjoy again and again.</p></body></html>

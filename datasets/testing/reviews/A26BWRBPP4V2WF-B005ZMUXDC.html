<meta name="summary" content="A middling Disney film on a bargain-basement DVD"></head><body><p>Tangled is the 50th film produced by Walt Disney's animation studio (for clarity, that number does not include joint productions, or Disney releases from other animation studios like Pixar).  This list of 50 includes some of the greatest movies of all time - Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, The Lion King, and 101 Dalmations.  Unfortunately, Disney studios has ceded the animation mantle to Pixar, and their last 10 films cannot hold a candle to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles.  So I was expecting, for the 50th film, a better effort, especially with John Lassiter as producer.  While Tangled does not quite live up to its more distant predecessors, it at least is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and it does contain some very nice animation and some big laughs.  It is also likely to be remembered as an "also ran" when compared to Disney's other release of 2010, Toy Story 3, which won an Oscar and set the box office record for most successful animated film of all time.<br /><br />Tangled is an adaptation of the Rapunzel story, elaborating and making Rapunzel's hair the fountain of youth (it's not as absurd as it sounds!).  I suppose that explains how she can drag it through meadows, rivers, and forests and never get it dirty.....  Unfortunately for Rapunzel, the hair needs to be attached to her head for it to work its magic, therefore she is held prisoner in the tower to satisfy the selfish needs of her adoptive mother, Gotha.  A thief named Ryder, fleeing from his latest caper, uses Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place, and their meeting sets in motion a chain of events involving Rapunzel and Ryder travelling to the royal city, pursued by the local constabulary, Ryder's disgruntled henchmen, and Rapunzel's "mother".<br /><br />Ryder's quipping asides generate many laughs, as do the antics of Maximus, a horse from the city guard that goes beyond the call of duty in trying to bring Ryder to justice.  There is also the joy of a remarkable action set-piece involving a breaking dam that is (dare I say it?) astonishing in it's animation (akin to the scale of Mulan's avalanche or the Lion King's stampede).  There is also the usual cast of Disney minor characters to lend colour and fun to the proceedings.  Certainly children will enjoy it, male or female, at least, if my 2 sons (5 and 3) and their female cousin (5) are any indication.  And it's ultimately harmless, certainly there are no traumatizing moments like Mufasa's death, and the violence is FAR less than that seen in The Incredibles or even Sleeping Beauty.<br /><br />But it doesn't quite all add up to a classic film.  I think the problem lies in the backstory - Rapunzel is kidnapped by Gotha from her parents, but there is no emotion in their plight because no time is spent in developing their characters or any relationship with their daughter.  By contrast, King Stephan has a prolonged scene in the middle of Sleeping Beauty, Mufasa teaches Simba and plays with him in the Lion King, and Belle's sacrifice for her father in Beauty and the Beast is not taken until after a number of establishing scenes showing Maurice by himself and with Belle.  Thus the reunion in Tangled has no particular emotion in it.  The second problem is with the music - there are a number of songs by Alan Menken (with lyricist Glenn Slater), but they sound like they belong in a Saturday afternoon teenage sitcom on the Disney Channel (e.g. "When Will My Life Begin" and "I See the Light"). True, "I've Got a Dream" is a joyous setpiece to rival "I Just Can't Wait to be King" or "Under the Sea", but one song does not a musical make.  Finally, I would be remiss if I neglected to point out that this is not a good value-for-money DVD.  Considering I paid the same price for Toy Story 3 and Tangled, the former has a number of neat extras, including a featurette on Pixar's modelling process, various short tours of Pixar's studio, and footage of a Buzz action figure on the International Space Station.  All Tangled has is footage on an alternate beginning which, while interesting, is paltry indeed compared to most Disney releases.  (of course, the intended audience will not care one whit that the DVD has no extras....)<br /><br />Overall, I'd place Tangled in with the likes of lesser (but still enjoyable) films such as Atlantis, Hunchback of Notre Dame, or Pocahontas (but better than The Rescuers or Tarzan).  And it's certainly better than most other animation out there that passes for children's entertainment, such as Will Farrell's Curious George, the Rugrats Movie, the Clone Wars film, and even Pixar's A Bug's Life.</p></body></html>

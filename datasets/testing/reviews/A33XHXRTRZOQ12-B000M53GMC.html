I mean, tapes have the usual bugaboos, yes, (wrinkles, the occasional dropouts, the VERY rare occurence of breakage,) but the picture is usually beautifully saturated, full and well defined. EVERY DVD I have, with the exception of one of "Charade", has this annoying washout to the colors with exaggerated highlights and paler fleshtones. I usually have to darken my TV's picture to an unnatural level to get anywhere NEAR the same fidelity of tone I get with a VHS tape.<p>That settled, I'd like to say that the extras that come with this DVD, (about the only thing the format seems to HAVE over VHS except for the wrinkle-free aspect, and even THEN not on all DVDs!) are nice, with extensive behind-the-scenes info on the production of the film and trivia about Gert Frobe's reading of the title role and that great car. <p>However, once the American public realizes what a crappy picture theyr'e getting with DVDs, I predict there will be rush back to tape that'll scare people! Heck, the format's going dirt cheap these days, anyway, with sound that I think is BETTER, (along with the picture,) than DVD!!</p></body></html>

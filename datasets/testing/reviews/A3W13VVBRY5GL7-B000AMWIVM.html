After the crapsome crap that's been spilling out of Hollywood like so much blood from an elevator for the last number of years, here is finally a movie with a lot of originality and some actual, honest-to-god shock moments!<br /><br />Although horror really isn't a fair genre in which to bracket 'Saw', seeing as how it's not really a scary movie, in the traditional sense of the term. No ghosts, no supernatural goings-on, no girls with long black hair crawling backwards out of the television, and nothing in the loft. Think of it more as a terribly effective thriller, set in a very grim environment.<br /><br />To synopsise the plot, two men wake up chained to opposite walls of a disused men's room. There's a corpse laying dead in the centre of the floor, with a cassette player in his hand. Our two protagonists find cassettes in their pockets, personally addressed to them. And from there, they must piece together the events that have led up to their capture, as well as find a way out of their predicament before six o' clock... or else!<br /><br />Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) aren't great actors, so there's not a lot on offer for fans of carefully crafted performances. Some of the plot devices, too, feel a little familiar, once the movie gets going. And there's a lot of visual fluffing, in terms of flashy camerawork and overwrought flashback sequences. So what makes "Saw" work so well?<br /><br />Originality. The first thirty minutes of the movie are as affecting in their visual melancholia as they are in the amount of tension they succeed in building. Director James Wan's success in establishing the initial hopelessness and melancholia of the captives' situation is admirable, given that it's so simple. The story, too, is a more original version of a serial killer fable, and while the flashiness of the movie won't really cause you to mull over the nature of good and evil, there's certainly a strong backstory behind the events of the main film.<br /><br />Set-pieces are similarly original - think of a slightly less plausible version of 'Se7en' and you'll get an idea of what I mean. It's not a very gory movie, either, despite what you may have heard - but the imagery that Wan uses is very unsettling in places, and very effective because of this. And performance-wise, while the two leads won't win any oscars for this one, they're by no means bad actors, nor are they unsuccessful in setting out what the intend to do - personally, I was rooted to my seat from beginning to end, and, in a time where bad horror has made it nigh-on impossible for us to feel fear in the cinema anymore, that's no mean feat.<br /><br />All in all, "Saw" is highly deserving of praise for being a truly original and very effective movie. It's well-made, it's tense, and it's very compelling. While rental might be enough for most of us, the DVD extras are enough to warrant purchase, and all in all, I can recommend this one very highly.</p></body></html>

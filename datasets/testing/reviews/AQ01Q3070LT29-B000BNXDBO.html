<meta name="summary" content="I really want a White Castle hamburger.  Sliders."></head><body><p>Released July 20, 2004. As soon as you load the DVD, John Cho and Kal Penn are driving in the car talking to each other about this DVD waiting for you to select in option.  But wait!  It's fun to watch the next five minutes play out before you make a choice.<br />  Nice gimmick:  White Castle Hamburgers is a restaurant founded in 1923, but only found back east in the USA.  There are no White Castle Restaurants in the West or Mid-West.  Briefly there was one in Hollywood, California as recent as 2004 for publicity purposes, but now the closest restaurants are in Minnesota and Missouri.<br />  Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are pals who live together.  They get the munchies and then they both see a White Castle Hamburger commercial.  Immediatly, they decide to drive all the way to New Brunswick to the White Castle.  This is just the beginning of a late night adventure.  Harold could eat 20 White Castle hamburgers right now.  He hasn't been to a White Castle in ages.<br />  They finally make it to New Brunswick.  Kumar knows the mega-plex is there, the little White Castle must be across the street.  Well, it is now a Burger Shack.  So now they agree to drive to Cherry Hill to a White Castle, however there are a few unexpected stops along the way.  Will these guys ever make it to White Castle?<br />  I think Hollywood has a brand new comedy team.  I would love to see John Cho and Kal Penn make more movies together.<br />  I think Neil Patrick Harris has demolished his "Doogie Howser" image forever.<br />  That was Christopher Meloni (HBO, "OZ", NBC, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) as "Freakshow".<br />  DVD includes a 12-minute "John Cho & Kal Penn: The Backseat Interview with Bobby Lee".  A 10-minute explaination of "The Art of the Fart" and looking for fart recordings, including at a truck stop.  Deleted Scenes, one with Luis Guzman, Alternate Scenes and outtakes, DVD-ROM/online features.<br /><br />  Three audio commentaries: Director with John Cho and Kal Penn, Writers Commentary, and "Extreme" Commentary with Danny Bochart.<br /><br />United Kingdom title: Harold & Kumar Get The Munchies (2004).<br /><br />  Followed by:<br /><br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DDSTJM">Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (Unrated)</a> (2008).<br /><br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OFN052">A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)</a>(2011).<br /><br /> John Cho played "Sulu" in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWRYJE">Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition)</a> (2009) and will again in Star Trek 12 to be released May 17, 2013.<br /><br />  Update: An animated Harold & Kumar tv series is in development for The Cartoon Channel's "Adult Swim" program.</p></body></html>

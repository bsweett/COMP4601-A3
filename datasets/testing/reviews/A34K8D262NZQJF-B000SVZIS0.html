<meta name="summary" content="Not a great effort especially from Burton!"></head><body><p>I really had no desire watching this whole movie the first time i saw it. Something to me about some mean apes has never really captured any of my amusement. I also wanted to see the remaking vision of Tim Burton but alas, it was a poop! The movie has a slow pace and mark walberg and the dumb blonde chick don;t really put up an out of this world menace to the apes as heston did. Instead it's a little more stylish but i felt the environment was too enclosed for some scenes showing alot of difficulty was done even to finish them! Anyways the features are decent but if you are an apes fan than I guess you have a good reason of buying this dvd!</p></body></html>

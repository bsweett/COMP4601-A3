<meta name="summary" content="Classic Trek..."></head><body><p>The Wrath of Khan is the best and most dramatic Trek movie, featuring vigorous acting from Ricardo Montalban, a great script and explosive (for Trek) special effects. The scene when those brain bugs go into the ears of two of the characters still gives me the creeps! After this, the Trek movies seem to get more and more ponderous, as if the Trek cast, crew and production company are all-too-aware of their cult status. Trek 4, Trek 6 and Star Trek: First Contact are the best theatrical Trek films, IMHO.<p>Enjoy!</p></body></html>

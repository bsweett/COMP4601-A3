<meta name="summary" content="Tried To Be The Next Generation Of Indiana Jones But Becomes The Next Generation Of Boredom"></head><body><p>At first the movie really feels promising but just after ten minutes through the movie you can see how it's copied past movies so much it's just becomes boring and monotonous lacking anything to keep you from watching the end of the movie.  I felt we would see a new character treasure hunting adventurer seeking a lost treasure,  divining mythical historical puzzles,  or at least having decent historical knowledge but this character has almost next to nothing on any of this.  Another subplot put into the movie is the humanitarian female lead trying to save something or someone played by Penelope Cruz whose own lack luster acting made a boring movie even worse to watch,  I mean for all the hype that was given to her while the movie was made her emotional acting in it was atrocious.  Also how can we have a movie like this without the humorous sidekick Steve Zahn which again the actor picked just made you turn the movie off instead of having to watch this garbage through to the end.  If you're looking for a good treasure hunting action movie try out the Indiana Jones or National Treasures movies those at least give you the characters you will enjoy and a storyplot that will keep you entertained unlike this sad mistake that was made and which I truly wish I had not force myself to watch and can hopefully forget about soon...</p></body></html>

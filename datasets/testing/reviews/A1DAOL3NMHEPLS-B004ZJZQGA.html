While the subject matter is grim, the dialog and constant plot twists keep it from becoming TOO grim; there some truly inspired lines like "I was selling horse tranquilizers to a dwarf."  If blood and/or swearing are not to your liking, "In Bruges" is not the movie for you, but if offbeat dark comedy and drama are your cup of tea, you'll enjoy this one!</p></body></html>

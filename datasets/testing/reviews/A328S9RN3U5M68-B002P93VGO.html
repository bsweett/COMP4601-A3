<meta name="summary" content="A Diversion"></head><body><p>Not being a fan for the comic book films or video game films (both of which seem to dominate the theater screens today) this viewer watched X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE on one of those 'there is nothing else on TV to watch' evenings.  And surprise!  The film is not that bad.  Yes, it is corny and rather geared to young impressionable audiences, but the surprise is that the actors participating in this very slow weak script by David Benioff and Skip Woods seem to believe in it - or at least tongue in cheek have a good time with all the gimmicks built in to this story about the creation of mutants.  Gavin Hood directs the chaos.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman takes the lead, struggling against his darker brother of special traits Liev Schreiber and the audience actually hollers for the good guy/bad guy encounters.  It really helps this very long film to add the always reliable gifted comedian  cum Adonis Ryan Reynolds to the recipe: his time is far to short as he seems to be able to balance the comic book idea against the 'real drama' flavor the story needs. Danny Huston likewise makes the most of the head bad guy, maintaining a dignity that makes his role more credible.  Taylor Kitsch adds some interest as a newcomer and Lynn Collins does her best to toss in a bit of love life to the soup.<br /><br />But it is a film for CGI lovers and that audience will likely not be disappointed.  The idea of justifying the beginnings of a comic book hero grows old, but at least we don't have to worry about a prequel to this one!  See it for Jackman, Reynolds and Schreiber -lots of flash and pizZazz and set destruction in addition to their inherent star quality values.  Grady Harp, June 10</p></body></html>

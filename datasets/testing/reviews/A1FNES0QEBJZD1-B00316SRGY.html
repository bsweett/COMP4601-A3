<meta name="summary" content="Gran Torino on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>I love this film and ,when seeing it in the theater, it was nothing like I expected and everything I hoped for.  The 5 stars go to an incredibly moving, dramatic and humorous film that should have won an Academy award for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best everything.  That said, there are plenty of reviews here already doing a book report on the plot so I will refrain from that.<br /><br />So lets take a look at the Blu Ray version and how it stacks up to the Standard version which I also own. The Standard DVD version was not bad to begin with.  The Blu Ray video transfer is good, not great.  There is a scene early in the film when a car pulls up and you can clearly see aliasing/stairstepping in the cars chrome grill.  Seeing this, I look for those artifacts in other areas of the video transfer but failed to find them.  As this is a dark film, somewhat  desaturated in color, the shadows retain depth and detail as a blu ray transfer should, but, then again, so did the standard def version.  The Audio is DDHD and, as this is a very dialogue driven film, there was little use for the surround speakers or sub. There was some use of the front side channels when cars were driven but that was about it.<br /><br />The extras were the typical commentaries, and an interesting and informative 'making of' with a good amount of discussion regarding integrating the Hmong culture and actors within the film.  This was well worth watching.  Really don't see the big deal about BD Live...does anyone really use it?  I would have rather space been used for deleted scenes, of which there were none, out takes and the like.  You were able to see some original audition clips for the parts of Sue and Thao and I would have liked more of this.<br /><br />I buy movies on Blu Ray for a serious upgrade of both video and audio.  While this movie gets 5 stars because it is a great film, for those who have the standard def version, I do not believe that you will see a significant difference between it and the blu ray version.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.</p></body></html>

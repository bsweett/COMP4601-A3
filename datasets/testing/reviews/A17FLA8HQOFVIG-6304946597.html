<meta name="summary" content="He believed in the glory of war"></head><body><p>This 1970 film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starring George C. Scott won eight Academy Awards.  It is the story of the famous General George Patton, one of the most successful and feared generals in WW2.  He believed in the glory of war and often quoted the classics, believing that he was reincarnated from some of history's most famous military leaders.  He cursed a lot and was, at the same time, deeply religious and there is no doubt that he cared about the men under his command. Relentless in battle, he believed in discipline and hated cowardice.  The press made a big thing about how he slapped a soldier who was crying, forcing Patton to make a public apology for that incident.<p>This was George C. Scott's greatest role and it is interesting to note that he refused his Academy Award for best actor because he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors.  He was larger than life in every single scene of the 171 minute epic and came across as intended - stubborn and unlikable and a bit of a nut job.  I never could either admire or feel any empathy for him as a person although I was glad that he won the battles. However, in spite of the battle scenes as well as his frequent confrontations with authorities, I found myself bored.  Maybe this was because I knew that he would win the battles and therefore found little dramatic tension.  The video was much too long and I actually fell asleep several times.  I wanted to like the film better, but unfortunately couldn't.<p>I can't help thinking about the times in which this film hit the theaters. The Vietnam War was raging and there was a huge anti-war backlash.  Patton had to be considered the epitome of what was then called a &quot;hawk&quot; who raged about the glory of war in spite of the agony of the men who had fallen in battle.  This film was not just about WW2; it was about all war.  And it dared to glorify war itself without sugar coating it as fighting for what is right and mom's apple pie.  The appeal of the film was that it made people look at their own perceptions of war, a debate that was already on everyone's agenda.  Perhaps that it what made it so popular at the time.  It must have also played better on a big screen than my tiny TV. The film is important only for fans of war films, as it is a classic in that genre.  For all others, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></body></html>

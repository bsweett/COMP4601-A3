Both films tell essentially the same story, but the former is cheap, shallow stuff from a hack director, while the latter is a highly skilled and emotionally involving entertainment. (It is perhaps significant that Emmerich relies heavily on models and CGI, while Gibson uses mostly practical effects, turning to CGI when it's the only way something can be done.) It is especially notable that, though Gibson's direction is almost free of any sort of sentimentality, we completely identify with the "good" characters, whereas Emmerich is clich&eacute;d, hokey, and largely uninvolving.<br /><br />Other than being a rousing (and unbelievably brutal) adventure story, it's hard to discern Mel Gibson's perspective. Is he attacking modern American materialism? Is he justifying the subjugation of the aboriginal peoples by the Spanish (if only because it ended human sacrifice)? Does he feel that the Mayan civilization /would not/ have been overthrown if it had not been so deeply involved in human sacrifice? * Is he suggesting that it is America's destiny and/or obligation to rule the world? ** Is he advocating a pagan lifestyle that is close to nature and far from the Christian church? The latter might seem strange coming from a conservative Catholic, but "Apocalypto" can indeed be interpreted that way. It is perhaps all these things -- or none of them.<br /><br />Gibson appears to be using "apocalypse" in its original sense -- a prophecy or revelation. Though there are prophecies and revelations throughout the film, the full intent becomes clear only in the last minute, not unlike "Signs". If nothing else, Gibson is searching for a sense that what happens on this plane of existance has purpose and meaning.<br /><br />Though "Apocalypto" is rightly rated R for its graphic brutality, it would not be inappropriate for older teens. It is a kind of insane "travelogue" that places the viewer in a largely unfamiliar environment, to exit with the feeling that one's life has been altered (if only slightly) by an experience that most humans are fortunate never to pass through. It's for this reason that I've rated "Apocalypto" five stars.<br /><br />PS: Contrary to what one poster wrote, the Mayan civilization continued up until the arrival of the Spanish. (There was, however, a general broad decline 700 years earlier.) If one wishes to dump on Mel Gibson, one might consider his lack of knowledge of basic astronomy. I leave it for viewers to spot the horrendous error.<br /><br />* The film's "title quote" is to the effect that a great civilization cannot be conquered from without unless it has destroyed itself from within. This is ascribed (quaintly) to "W. Durant" -- ie, Will Durant, the co-author of "The Story of Civilization", the mini-library that rests in the home of almost everyone who ever belonged to the Book of the Month Club. I've had mine 40 years, and have hardly /begun/ reading it.<br /><br />** One gets this sense from the Mayan priest's speech.</p></body></html>

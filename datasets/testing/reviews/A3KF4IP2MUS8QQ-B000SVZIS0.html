<meta name="summary" content="A planet where apes evolved from men?"></head><body><p>This modern remaking of Planet of the Apes is ultimately a victim of its own hype.  It is by no means a bad movie, but it is also not the blockbuster thrill ride of an adventure it was forecast to be.  Then the whole brouhaha about Charlton Heston's cameo appearance and the lines he delivered gave the movie an undeserved stigma of mockery.  The whole gun control mythology built up around Heston's dialogue is as inane and improper a talking point as I have ever seen.  As for the movie, it does offer a lot of good, sometimes impressive action complemented by better than average special effects.  The apes, with a couple of exceptions, are also remarkably realistic.  The real weakness of the movie is the plot.  It seems simple enough.  Mark Wahlberg, in an adequate performance, plays Captain Leo Davidson, who decides to go after the lost space-going chimp he has trained to explore an astronomical anomaly.  He gets sucked in to the cosmic anomaly and thrown out several thousand years in the future on a planet run by intelligent apes (not monkeys, it is important to note, especially if you are in the company of apes).  Here humans are enslaved under a brutal system rife with abuse and mockery.  Not all apes support the policy of militant slavery as best represented by the cold and ruthless General Thade (Tim Roth).  Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a senator's daughter, believes that apes and man can coexist, and she ends up helping Davidson and his gang of escaped slaves to safely flee the city.  Unfortunately, what Davidson leads the humans toward is the ultimate showdown between apes and men on the planet.  A little monkey ex machina is thrown in toward the end, and this plot point works fairly well.  Not content to stop here, though, the filmmakers throw in a final twist that I applauded the first time I watched the film but regard with some ambivalence now.<p>Unfortunately, Planet of the Apes gets too cute for its own good.  Ari, a central player in events, does not carry the force she should, in my opinion, because the same makeup artists who did an outstanding job on General Thade and others tried to make her look too human; at any rate, she doesn't exactly scream "ape" at me.  Then there are all of the little in-jokes and attempts at witticism.  I'm all in favor of including the obligatory "get your hands off me, you damn dirty human" line, and I would have even welcomed the classic "a planet where apes evolved from men" quip (which was not used here, for good reason as things turn out).  However, the babbling slave trading baboon-type character with his constant complaints and ill-fated use of the "can't we all just get along" line annoyed me to no end.  Adequate characterization is lacking in several places in this movie.  I'm not sure why the human Daena (played by the exceedingly human female Estella Warren) was even included here; her obvious feelings for Davidson remain unexplored, as Davidson seems to have eyes only for the much less enticing ape woman who helped him escape.  I also cringe whenever I see Kris Kristofferson in a movie, but I guess that's just my own problem.  <p>While the movie does seem to pull punches with the storyline, it is quite generous in terms of the extras to be found on the DVD.  I have not watched any of these special features because I'm not impressed enough by the movie to really care about them, but the fact that the bonus DVD does offer commentary, five extended scenes, a music video, six documentaries on the making of the film, and some other goodies should not go unnoticed by anyone thinking about buying Planet of the Apes.  I will say that the movie can be a lot of fun to watch, but it took too much of a low road in terms of storyline and characterization to win my enthusiastic approval.</p></body></html>

This review is intended for people who have seen this trash and are trying desperately to reassure themselves that they are not alone in hating it.<br />Tim Robbin's character, Dave Boyle, was raped by men as a child.  Since then he has lived his life as best he can, apparently.  He is a devoted husband and father.  On the night that Sean Penn's character's daughter is murdered, Boyle has the bad luck to murder a pedophile right at the same time and to behave cagily accordingly.  Thereupon he is mistaken by lots of people for Penn's daughter's murderer and is eventually executed by Penn.  When it becomes known that he is not the killer, that he did in fact kill a pedophile who was in the process of sexing-up a young boy, the general consensus is, "Ahh, well, its for the best anyway"  the idea being that since he was raped as a child he's pretty much better off dead.  As one character puts it, "Looks like damaged goods to me."  And as Sean Penn's character figuratively says, "The last time I saw Dave Boyle?  It was (before he was molested as a child)."  So, do you see why I loathe this flick on a variety of levels?  Do you?  It is not enough for the flick to contain bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad continuity... the picture also is morally vile:  it is a message movie, the basic message of which is, "If you were molested as a child, do everyone a favor and put a bullet in your head.  You're finished.  Gee, that's real inspiring.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a melodrama in a crazy farce style"></head><body><p>for the script, if you could let go of yourself of all the logic and decide to have a good time before stepping into the dark theatre, then this movie is quite all right and sometimes funny. but robert downey jr. or the screenplay writer turn director, both failed to make funny things convincingly believable. the most bothering scenario and the scenes that bothered me so much was the left pinky finger, broken so easily by a shutting door, broken so evenly, at that moment it's still fine with me.<br /><br />but at least downey jr should act that's really hurt. because one of the most painful things in the world is hurt one of your fingers, albeit a finger totally broken off from your hand, i think that might make a guy faint, and the pain would not go away so easily and so fast. re-attaching the finger back in an emergency room by just one nurse? still fine with me. but from the moment that finger fell to the floor to that finger reattached back to his hand, downey jr. still kept using his left hand so naturally comfortable, that's an unacceptable big overlook. i'd like you to watch carefully how and why robert downey jr was a good actor but never a great one. he could only  focus on interpretating a certain part of the character he played but never did a thorough study and control of how and when he should look more legit or more believable to perform that character. great actors always covered all the basis he played with consistency and logic. like this broken finger, a good actor and a good director could both do a lot good on this scenario, but in this movie, they both lost it. downey jr. kept forgetting that he got a useless left hand with a broken finger and the director never reminded him that he should be more conscious about his left hand by not using it too much or not at all; not even let his left arm drop down, guy with a broken finger would never let that hand drop straight downward, because that throbbing pain would be too much to be bearable.<br /><br />the screenplay is not a serious one and almost every setting is full of inconsistency and bad logic, sometimes even very ridiculous.  the matured val kilmer actually acted better and better and he never exaggerated the acting and overdid anything, his performance was very solid in this melodrama.</p></body></html>

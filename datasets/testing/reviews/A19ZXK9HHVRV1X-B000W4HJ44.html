Since the material seemed tailor-made for the stage from the outset, it was only a matter of time before some astute dramatists (in this case, Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan) would get around to converting it into a smash Broadway show - and, indeed, their creation went on to win the Tony Award for Best Musical of 2002.  Now "Hairspray" has come full circle, returning as a full-fledged movie musical that will lift your spirits and set your toes to tapping in record-setting time.  Needless to say, only a total curmudgeon could resist the pull of this film.<br /><br />The musical "Hairspray" stays true to the ebullient spirit, ribald satire and offbeat humor of the original film while adding a generous helping of original song-and-dance numbers that take the material to a new level.  Newcomer Nikki Blonsky assumes the role, originated by Ricki Lake in the 1988 film, of Miss Tracy Turnblad, the eternally sunny teenager with a heart as outsized as her fulsome figure and ceiling-scraping coiffure.  Obsessed with the fashions and accoutrements of early '60's pop culture, Tracy takes Baltimore by storm when she secures a spot as a regular on the Corny Collins dance show on local TV.  Once ensconced on the program, the naively optimistic Tracy, a true product of her time, spearheads the effort to bring white and black teens together on the dance floor, a radical proposition for 1962 that does not sit well with the bigoted station manager and major segments of the city`s population.  As such, the movie is what "Grease" or "Bye Bye Birdie" might have been had they been imbued with a social conscience.  Yet, even though this "Hairspray" is immensely enjoyable on any number of levels, we still miss some of the trademark subversiveness that Waters brought to the original (Tracy`s being thrown into "special ed" classes at school, for instance, has been summarily dropped).  For all its undeniable glory and charm, this is a softer, more user-friendly version of the story than we're used to seeing.  But the original's themes of inclusiveness, of breaking down social barriers, and of being true to oneself still come through loud and clear.<br /><br />As a crowd-pleasing musical, "Hairspray" kicks into high gear from its opening moments and never lets up.  Director Adam Shankman allows the innate energy of the material to burst out in any number of ways - be it the dazzling, high-stepping choreography; the gracefully gliding camerawork; the sharp, rhythmic editing; the bright, flashy color scheme; the clever, witty lyrics; or the nostalgia-inducing and humorously exaggerated hairdos and costumes.  There's even a wonderful scene in which Tracy's love interest sings a song to her framed picture - and the picture sings back!  This intense stylization allows "Hairspray" to exist in a never-never fantasy land where centuries of racial prejudice can be wiped away in the blink of an eye, and we never question the plausibility of it for a second.  It's a dream we want to believe in and, if it becomes a little self-congratulatory at times, well, who but the most dour party pooper is going to be complaining about that when the rest of us are having such a great time?<br /><br />Much of the credit for "Hairspray"'s success goes to the actors, all of whom do a splendid job capturing the offbeat, fun-loving spirit of the piece.  As Tracy,  Blonsky perfectly conveys the innate sweetness, wide-eyed innocence and boundless energy that make the character so tremendously appealing to the audience.  John Travolta, appearing in full fat-suit and drag, is a hoot as Tracie's supportive but supremely self-conscious mother, Edna, as is Christopher Walken as the devoted husband and father to the zaftig Turnblad clan.  Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Byrnes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Britanny Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly, Allison Janney and Jerry Stiller round out the spectacular, powerhouse cast.<br /><br />The score by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman is not only exuberant and catchy in its own right, but perfectly captures the rhythm and style of the music of the period.  I guarantee that your toes will be tapping quite a bit throughout the course of this film.<br /><br />In a summer in which audiences have seen one bloated mega-blockbuster after another crash and burn before their very eyes, it is a joy to be able to report that here at last is the genuine article - a perfect summertime entertainment that restores your faith in commercial moviemaking and will have you coming back for more.</p></body></html>

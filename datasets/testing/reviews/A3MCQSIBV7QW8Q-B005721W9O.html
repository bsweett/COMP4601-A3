<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Never Give Up, Never Surrender&quot;"></head><body><p>If you have never seen this movie, I must tell you now that you're missing out on one of the funniest movies ever made! The year 1999 has had some of my favorite movies, including &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;October Sky&quot;. &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is in that list.<br /><br />There was a TV series called &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; which is the story of the NSEA Protector and it's crew - &quot;Commander Peter Quincy Taggart&quot; played by Jason Nesmith (played by Timm Allen), &quot;Lt. Tawny Madison&quot; by Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), &quot;Dr. Lazarus&quot; by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), &quot;Tech Sergeant Chen&quot; by Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and &quot;Lieutenant Trek Laredo&quot; by Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell). But after four years, the show was cancelled, leaving the actors and actresses without any jobs. Twenty years later, at a convention center, they meet up with aliens Commander Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees), Quellek (Patrick Breen), and Laliari (Missi Pyle). They are from the alien race Thermians (or Termites! (you'll have to watch the movie to understand!)) and having mistaken the Galaxy Quest TV show for 'historical documents', they request the 'crew' to help them negotiate the terms with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs). But of course, things don't go they way they seem since the actors are now playing for their lives! And with the help of Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), if you could call him 'help', and Galaxy Quest fan Brandon (Justin Long), they set out to save the universe.<p>Witty and funny, this movie will keep you in stiches throughout the whole 1 hour and 42 minutes of it! Acting is marvelous with Tim Allen as the 'raving ego-maniac', Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Gwen (watching her you won't be able to believe that she's in her 50's!!), and Alan Rickman as the serious English actor. <p>Though there's nothing bad about this movie, there are some innuendos and some bad language henceforth the PG rating. But not only that I don't think kids will really understand it or even get most of the jokes. More likely teenagers and adults will enjoy this movie much more. I'm most certain by the time you've watched this movie a couple of times, you'll be reciting all of the funny lines from the movie (my family does all of the time!)</p></body></html>

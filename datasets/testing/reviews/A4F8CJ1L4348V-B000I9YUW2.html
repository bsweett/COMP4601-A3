<meta name="summary" content="A parent's tie with thier children"></head><body><p>I really liked this movie. It does show how strong a parent's tie with thier children certainly are. Watching this movie certainly made me think of all of the parents that have lost thier children via accidents, child abductions or run-aways and how the parents must feel. Appreciation of what you have comes to mind and love the ones that you have, because tomorrow they could be gone. I liked this movie because it told of the "real pain" that Telly was feeling when her child was gone and "others" tried to erase her memories. I did watch the extended alternate ending which I do recommend in seeing. This movie is an on the edge of your seat thriller and I do recommend it to anyone!!!</p></body></html>

They were a race as time itself.  They had mastered the ultimate technology: the ability to alter physical reality by will alone.  They called this ability "tuning."  But they were dying.  Their civilization was in decline and so they abandoned their world seeking a cure for their own mortality.  Their endless journey brought them to a small blue world in the farthest corner of the Galaxy-our world.  Here they thought they had finally found what they had been searching for..."<br /><br />The actual story then begins with John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakening in a strange hotel room where he finds that he's wanted for a series of murders.  But the problem is that he can't remember a thing.  Pursued by the police led by Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) and haunted by The Strangers, he tries to discover the riddle of his identity.  But in a city where reality is the ultimate illusion, discovering the truth proves to be a major challenge.<br /><br />The viewer is kept guessing for the first two-thirds of this movie and its in the final one-third that all answers as to what exactly is going on is revealed.<br /><br />A highlight of this movie is the fantastic visuals brought about by mind-boggling special effects.  I thus really believed that The Strangers could alter physical reality (as mentioned in the above narration).<br /><br />Many people did not like Kiefer Sutherland's acting where he gave the scientist character a breathy, almost Peter Lorre type voice.  I, however, liked his performance.  Also look for the fine performance by William Hurt as the police inspector.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD is practically flawless in picture and sound quality.  It has a host of interesting extras, including an audio commentary by Roger Ebert.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a thought-provoking movie that truly "sets a bold new standard in science-fiction."  Be sure to see it, and find out why Roger Ebert named this movie in 1998 as best movie of the year!!<br /><br />(1998;  95 min;  double-sided disc; widescreen/full screen;  16 scenes)<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

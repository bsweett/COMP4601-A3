<meta name="summary" content="A movie about headgames from start to finish"></head><body><p>I'll admit I popped Inglourious Basterds in the player expecting a completely different movie, a mind-numbing violent and bloody movie.  That didn't happen so I kept asking myself "what is going on here?"  I was too curious to stop watching because the acting was incredible, purposefully exaggerated, and at times absolutely hysterical (Brad Pitt).  About 2/3's of the way through the movie it hit me what was going on; the movie is about headgames!<br /><br />I immediately started the movie over and watched it from the headgame perspective.  Inglourious Basterds is BRILLIANT in every scene from start to finish demonstrating both how to play headgames on others and how one's own headgames messes with your own behavior.  The script, pace, timing, and total commitment of every character to the headgames they are going to inflict or endure is masterful. The movie plays like a mental chess game where the characters disarm, position, or manipulate their opponents, establish their offense, then attack when the time is right.  Every chapter demonstrates something new to add to the story.<br /><br />If you have to deal with headgames in your life at any level, watch Inglourious Basterds with your brain turned into the headgame frequency.  You will be entertained and educated.</p></body></html>

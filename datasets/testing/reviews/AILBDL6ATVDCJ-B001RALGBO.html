<meta name="summary" content="I wanted to hate it, but I liked it...I really liked it."></head><body><p>I first heard about the production of this movie on the George Norry (not sure how to spell his name) show (fomerly wacky UFO and supernatural freak - Art Bell), so I thought it might be a little strange.  I had also heard that the movie was very political and was a basic slap in the face to my fellow Republicans.  But it was NOT that bad, concerning a political slant, at all.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the special effects.  The acting was not bad - I almost always enjoy everything Dennis Quaid does.  The story line could have been a little more believable, but all and all, this is a film that delivers great scenes, good dialogue and some very attractive people on screen.<br /><br />I can't think of a single part of the film that I found myself getting bored - that's a good thing.  I would suggest this movie to people of all ages.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum is awesome on the screen.  She manages to have that girl-next-door look and supermodel look going at the same time.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal (from "October Sky" and the shockingly terrible "Bubble Boy") does a great job in this film!  I really think he took the role as far as it could go.  I couldn't picture anyone else plaing this role.<br /><br />I say buy it - I really think you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

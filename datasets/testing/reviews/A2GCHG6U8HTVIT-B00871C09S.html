<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock at His Best, With a Nice Dollop of Voyeurism"></head><body><p>One of my favorite Hitchcock movies. I wish Stewart had been about ten years younger, but you take what you can get...and he was first rate. Someone wrote somewhere that Hitchcock more than most great directors needed strong, stylish actors to best show off his films. It's probably significant that some of his films that seem (to me) the weakest have leads that are uncharismatic, can't dominate the screen, or who simply don't mesh with Hitchcock's style. After Vertigo I think he ran out of male leads who had that style and who also were relatively young. My understanding is that Sean Connery and Paul Newman, both strong lead actors, did not enjoy working with Hitchcock...they simply didn't understand him and resented his directorial style, and it shows.<br /><br />I've never been too attracted to the high social ice queens that Hitchcock favored at this point in his career. Grace Kelly, however, I thought did a first-rate job of conveying her character's energy, her amusement at her own persona, of conveying a subtext of take-charge sexuality, and of being damn good looking.<br /><br />What I also find endearing is that the people in the apartments across the way were each given interesting stories that had beginnings, middles and endings...all with nearly no dialogue and all with the same distant camera angle.<br /><br />I've always had a soft spot for Wendell Corey, a fair actor in the Forties who seemed to get lost in the Hollywood shuffle games. And, of course, who doesn't enjoy voyeurism?</p></body></html>

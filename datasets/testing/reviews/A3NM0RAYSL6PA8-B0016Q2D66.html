Today, not much has changed, and there's never a bad time to perk up and pay attention. Based upon an acclaimed book written over thirty years ago, Revolutionary Road is a study in relationships, character, and existence, most of which are illusions cobbled together by disappointments and a little bit of genuine joy. That joy keeps us going, even though we're bitter, wounded, uncertain, and keeping at bay as best we can alienation, anomie, and moral unwinding.  I'm not sure there is any filmmaker today that puts on a better show about these ideas.  Together with American Beauty, Revolutionary Road is a sure-handed dissection of all the things that make the cozy upper-middle class insufferable and, ultimately, not redeemable. We're playing house as a wonderful pass-time to avoid truly living -- so much so, that really experiencing our lives seems more and more like some wishful daydream.<br /><br />There is no joyful or redemptive ending. In comparison, American Beauty is a sweet Jolly Rancher of optimism -- which in many ways it is. Nor is it perfect. In trying to add subtlety and complexity to the characters, some clarity was lost -- but, I don't necessarily fault Mendes for that.  One thing that's for certain is that nothing is clear about life. Like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Revolutionary Road gets into the mechanics of who we are alone and in relationships -- why we can't live with them, and can't, seemingly, live without them. And Kate Winslet, the common thread in both of those films, shines as a bright woman just looking for some peace of mind and a little stretch of happiness.<br /><br />Wonderful and intelligent, if a little studio-esque, Revolutionary Road is a smart film well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

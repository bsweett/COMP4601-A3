<meta name="summary" content="Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean"></head><body><p>There is a key scene in Ridley Scott's riveting crime epic "American Gangster" that speaks volumes about the personal code that drives one of the film's principal characters. "Look at the way you're dressed," says the impeccably groomed and tastefully attired 1970s Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in disgust, to his ostentatiously pimped-out brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), "...it's a look that says: `arrest me'. Remember, the loudest one in the room is also the weakest one in the room."<br /><br />It's one of the axioms Lucas picked up while paying his dues working as a driver for his mentor, an old-school Harlem crime lord (Clarence Williams III). By the time his boss keels over from a heart attack, Lucas has been thoroughly schooled in the shrewd business acumen of how to remain a "wolf in sheep's clothing"; no matter how venal your methods are for getting to the top and maintaining your position, if you're able to swing it while maintaining a respectable public appearance, everybody will still love you.<br /><br />Scott's film is all about "appearances"; judging a book by its cover, if you will. When we are first introduced to the film's other main character, New Jersey police detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), we're not sure if we're observing a cop and his partner serving a warrant, or if we're watching a disheveled street thug and his pal pulling a B & E on someone's apartment. While his personal grooming habits may be questionable, it is apparent that his integrity is of the highest order. He is an honest cop in a department that is swimming in corruption (he's sneered at as a "boy scout" when he turns in nearly one million dollars in cash discovered in a dealer's car).<br /><br />Lucas, on the other hand, maintains the outward appearance of an upstanding citizen. He has prospered via an ingenious Southeast Asian heroin pipeline that bypasses any pesky "middlemen". He buys an estate in the suburbs and sets up house for his brothers and his mother (played by the great Ruby Dee, who we don't see enough of these days). He marries a beautiful Latina (Lymari Nadal) and ingratiates himself as a pillar of the community.<br /><br />Steven Zailian's screenplay is based on true events; the story takes place in the same seedy 70s N.Y.C. milieu that inspired films like "The French Connection", "Serpico" and "Prince of the City". There are numerous references made to the real-life French connection case, as well as the police corruption that was depicted the latter two films.<br /><br />Scott uses a trick that worked well for Michael Mann in the similarly structured "Heat".  He builds a considerable amount of dramatic tension by keeping his two powerhouse stars apart for the lion's share of the film, while steadily teasing on the inevitability that the two men's professional paths are destined to cross. When Washington and Crowe finally do share a scene together, it proves to be well worth the wait (when you see it, watch closely for the coffee cup prop that becomes a proxy chess piece; it's a masterstroke of gesture from both actors).<br /><br />Scott utilizes his patented ultra-slick visual style, although a grittier look might have served the story better. Despite the deliberate pacing for the first 2 hours, something about  the denouement feels curiously rushed (sorry, can't elaborate-potential spoiler!) The performances by Washington and Crowe are superb, with a nice turn as well from Josh Brolin as a corrupt Special Investigations Unit cop, and Armand Assante as a mob big shot. I liked the period soundtrack as well, although we need to declare a moratorium on Bobby Womack's "Across 110th Street". It's a great song, but it's now been used in three films!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cinematicly brilliant. One of Kubrick's best."></head><body><p>`Clockwork Orange', directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on an important short novel by Anthony Burgess has the misfortune of being the movie Kubrick made after `2001'. I still remember having skipped out of work to see the movie on the very first afternoon it opened in local Baltimore theaters. I had read the novel and seen the previews many times over, so I was well primed for what I was about to see.<br /><br />My first reaction was that I was missing something. There were pieces of the movie which were truly masterful, especially Malcolm MacDowell's career defining role as the principle bad boy. The use of music was similarly well up to Kubrick's usually excellent use of borrowed music. The application of `Singin' in the Rain' alone was almost worth the price of admission. But somehow, neither the narrative nor the visual context seemed to hang together quite as well as Kubrick's earlier movies.<br /><br />In retrospect, this may not be too surprising, as `Full Metal Jacket', for example, has famously been described as half of a great movie and half of a good movie, with logical, but not entirely aesthetic connection between the two parts.<br /><br />Similarly, `Clockwork Orange' breaks down into at least three acts, where our `hero' Alex (MacDowell) is the quintessential bad boy, the tamed wimp, and the restored nasty Marker. Along the way, Kubrick does great things with ambient lighting, which makes this movie important from the cinematic point of view, but contributes only a marginal value to the overall audience experience.<br /><br />Part of my feeling of loss may be the fact that given the limited amount of screen dialogue in comparison to the dialogue in the book, Kubrick could not fully exploit Burgess' invented slang, which was a cross between Cockney and Russian words. This kind of wordplay is great for the cognoscenti, but it tends to leave the average audience scratching their heads trying to figure out what the characters are saying, without the benefit of a slang dictionary at the back of the book.<br /><br />Among all of Kubrick's works, this may be the least fondly remembered, because it had left no indelible quote in our minds like Slim Pickins' bomb ride, Hal's goodby to his human colleagues, Jack Nicholson's `Here's Johnny!', `Full Metal Jacket's `thousand yard stare',  and Sue Lyons' `Lolita'. `Eyes Wide Shut' and `Barry Lyndon' may be equally anonymous, but expectations for those films, I think was simply not as high as for `Clockwork Orange'.<br /><br />And yet, this movie is still better than 9/10 of all other movies ever made, and deserves an important place in our history of film. If for no other reason than it stands with `Bonnie and Clyde' as an exercize in the use of violence in film which is done to good cinematic effect rather than for pure gratuitous thrills.<br /><br />My biggest regret is that Herr Kubrick is no longer with us to give us comment tracks on his movies to give us some insights into his aesthetic.</p></body></html>

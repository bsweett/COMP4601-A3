It stars the dynamic duo of Robert De Niro and Joe Pecsi. This team made a number of great movies together, this arguably the best of the bunch.  Casino tells the story of Las Vegas: how it started and also how it ended. Robert De Niro plays Sam "Ace" Rothstein. Rothstein is a gambling extraordinaire mob backed Casino manager. His attention to detail is extensive to say the least. Throughout the film Sam explains the ins and outs of the Casino business in old school Las Vegas. Joe Pesci plays Rothstein's psychotic, visceral, and violent right hand man Nicky Santoro. Pesci really hit the mark on this one. Nicky is one of the most violent mobsters in film history.  His attitude is so over the top he leaves you terrified in your seat. Casino also includes a star studded cast of excellent players including: Sharon Stone (plays Ginger, Ace's wife, a role that earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress), Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, James Woods, and many others. To top it off Frankie Avalon plays the one and only Frankie Avalon. This film is full of great music, style, and ultimately many life lessons. It was made at the right time in the right way by Martin Scorsese. Casino is a timeless classic. Depending on your point your view: it will make you long for old Vegas or appreciate the Disney Land is has become. Take your pick just be careful when you driving around there in the desert. According to this film, there's a lot of stuff buried out there.</p></body></html>

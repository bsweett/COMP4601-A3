<meta name="summary" content="Best music biopic since "What's Love Got to Do With It""></head><body><p>"Ray," which I just caught in a sneak preview, is a grand film. It's vastly entertaining, incredibly well-acted and visually striking. Beyond that, the film gives a warts-and-all portrayal of its talented and troubled subject, Ray Charles.<br /><br />Though it deals primarily with Charles's attempts to make it in the music business and his struggles with womanizing and drug addiction, the film's most touching moments come from jarring flashes to his troubled, rural childhood. One scene, in which Charles's strong mother teaches him how to be self-reliant in spite of his blindness, is played without dialogue, yet the power of the scene reduced me to tears.<br /><br />Also, the film answers some key questions about how Charles coped with blindness and racism during his life.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx, who was already brilliant this year in "Collateral," gives his greatest performance to date as Charles. He has the mannerisms of the musician down, yet Foxx does more than mimic Charles and play up the man's disability. He's able to give Charles a sympathetic edge necessary throughout the film, even when Charles does some despicable things to his business partners and the women in his life. Foxx carries the movie, pays proper tribute to an American legend while keeping him human and injects the movie with enthusiasm and a sense of humor. This is the sort of acting that should and hopefully will garner an Academy Award nomination.<br /><br />Charles filled his life with intelligent, strong women. Kerry Washington and Regina King, playing his wife Della and his mistress Margie Hendrix, give notable performances in the film.<br /><br />Though the film has some flaws, it's compelling and watchable. And the touching story has an added impact because of Charles's recent death.<br /><br />Thankfully, the movie, done with Charles's approval before his death, is filled with his great music.<br /><br />I highly recommend "Ray."</p></body></html>

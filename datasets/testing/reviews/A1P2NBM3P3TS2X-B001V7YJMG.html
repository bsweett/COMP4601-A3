The English dubbed track isn't that great either, but it soars in comparison to the amateurish and overly-simplistic English subtitles.<br /><br />I'm a firm believer that foreign films are best watched (and listened to) in their native languages.  Sometimes the dubbed-voice acting just doesn't measure up.  But until they re-release this DVD with a proper set of English subtitles, the dubbed audio track may be the best viewing and listening option.  Such a shame to give such horrible treatment to such a terrific movie.</p></body></html>

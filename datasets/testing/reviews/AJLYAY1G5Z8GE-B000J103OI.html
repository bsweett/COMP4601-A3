<meta name="summary" content="Movie About A Hidden Side of Fashion, An Ugly One!"></head><body><p>A young women comes to New York searching a job as a journalist. She gets hired in a fashion magazine, which has a very tough work environment with a very tough president. The young women tries hard at first to resist this new culture she got in, however eventually she gets overwhelmed by it and loses many of its personal values and relationships. She experiences an internal struggle on whether she should keep sacrificing her life for her job, or the other way around.<br /><br />I am not into fashion myself, but I thought this movie depicts a challenge that everyone can relate to. It depicts the struggle between individuality and society, in which society is usually the stronger one and overcomes individuality.</p></body></html>

Just because a movie has clones doesn't make it a sci-fi, this movie is as much of sci-fi film as Attack of the Clones. Clones are like zombies, any idiot can write a hackneyed "BIG GOVERNMENT IS EVIL" clone story, just look at George Lucas. Moon's script SUCKS.<br /><br />I was watching the first half expecting some awesome mind-blowing complex third act that had something to do with the actual Moon, but nope, clones is all you get. "Ok" you might say, "it's not an M. Night Shymalamadingdong movie so it's not about the twist, it's about the journey", welp they failed in that regard too. The director (and I don't care who his father is, that's no excuse) is awful at mainting interest, he hasn't the first clue about the genre he's trying to ape, and Sam Rockwell alone is the only reason this turd has floated to the surface.<br /><br />I came out learning nothing new about the moon, I did not find any different perspectives on science or humanity to ponder as brain candy, and getting another hackneyed lazy "CORPORATIONS BAD!" story was the appropriately bland/unoriginal ending to a bland/unoriginal film. I was waiting anxiously for a bland predictable plot to unravel into something marvelous, but instead it actually got worse and worse until the mercifully rushed ending.<br /><br />Gerty also had almost no point, they easily could've developed his angle, but I think the real reason his character exists is so they can slap Kevin Spacey's name on this for marketing and sales purposes. Also how many scenes of the two clones getting in wacky scuffles did we have to see? It's frankly embarrasing that people consider a film where the director has to spoon feed the audience the plot as a 'sci-fi' film.<br />I've also noticed that all of my friends who say that Moon is good tend to not like sci-fi films in general, so that seems to be the jist of this movie, a sci-fi movie for people that don't like sci-fi; much like Star Wars it's just an excuse to change the location to outer space while still giving the audience a dumb predictable story.<br /><br />You're better off watching Sunshine.</p></body></html>

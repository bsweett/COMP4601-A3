However, Robin Williams got his character down cold as one Sy Parrish.  Sy has been working at SavMart for 14 years developing film for his customers, admiring their photos, getting into their lives -- and even making copies for himself to place on his wall!<br /><br />I like stories that start at the end and work through to the end again.  We have Sy in the county slammer, looks so white and antiseptic.  All white, but for a red chair.  He explains to the detective the whys and hows of what he's done.<br /><br />Director Mark Robenek does a fascinating job with photography -- the little, lonely man is so bland and chameleon, that he blends in to every scene he plays.  The blue & white uniform blends in with the store hallways; the beige jacket blends with the cars and the walls.<br /><br />We first get a hint that the lonely man has a volcano burning inside when he gets a crack in his car's windshield: "Great, now what?"<br /><br />Several themes for this film struck me:  the photos we take are of the happy times; we rarely shoot the sad times.  The photo is a fraction of a second, frozen in time.  As the film says, it's our urge to stop time.<br /><br />Sy Parrish though lonely and afraid of reality, knows he could never accomplish what the Yorkin family has and starts stalking them.  He imagines he is one of the family, walking around in their house, admiring their TVs and large house.  He even meets their nine year old son and promises to talk to his coach for treating him roughly.<br /><br />But when he "just happens" to leave photos of infidelity into Mrs. Yorkin's photo stack, things really start coming apart for Sy.<br /><br />My only criticism of the film is that it starts off slow and stays in neutral mode for quite some time, spends too much time in exposition and not enough in action.  But it's a thriller, a mental game if you will, so the viewer may appreciate this type of film at face value.<br /><br />I'll be looking for more Robin Williams' serious side.

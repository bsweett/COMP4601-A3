<meta name="summary" content="There's No One Like 'The Joker!'"></head><body><p>Over the years, Batman has encountered a variety of wild adversaries but nobody has been interesting than "The Joker," whether he was played by Caesar Romero (TV series),  Jack Nicholson (in here) or Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight).<br /><br />This re-introduction of Batman to the big screen in 1989 really got rolling when  Nicholson's "The Joker" came on screen. Then it took off and became wildly entertaining.  It didn't hurt that Kim Bassinger, meanwhile, was in her prime and looked awesome.<br /><br />Besides the stylish visuals, they didn't overdo the violence, either, and it wound up being a pretty good movie. This now 20-year-old series went through several Batmans before finally settling on Christian Bale. In this "opener," Michael Keaton played the Caped Crusader and I though he did just fine.  I had no complaints with his portrayal.</p></body></html>

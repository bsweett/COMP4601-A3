I think it is fair to compare the two movies because the new one is so obviously patterned on the original. It's clear that the director was not trying to remake the classic as much as he was trying to refresh it. To some extent, I think he succeeded. While the original had all the earmarks of a B movie, the new one has very high production values, adequate special effects, and top flight actors. But what the original had that the refresh does not is heart. When Lon Chaney Jr. learned what he had become, I believed in his remorse and fear of horrors he was bound to commit. Benicio del Toro does pronounce the same sort of fear, but I never felt it. It was more of a checking off of a box. The same is true of the father's character, although that was intentional and to say more would be a spoiler.<br /><br />As I watched the new WOLFMAN, I kept waffling between liking it and being ambivalent toward it. After letting the experience settle for a few days, I've decided on ambivalence. There was really nothing about it that got me excited or fascinated or touched. So Lon and Claude can rest easy. They haven't been replaced yet.  In a perfect world, it would have been wonderful to see what Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains could have done with today's production values.  That would have been magical, I am sure.<br /><br />"Even a man who is pure in heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."</p></body></html>

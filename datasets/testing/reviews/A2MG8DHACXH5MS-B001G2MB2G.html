<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter no longer a boy"></head><body><p>Harry Potter leads a rebellion inside Hogwarts as the dark Lord Voldemort begins recruiting an army. All is not well at Hogwarts as Dumbledoor is undermined by a Ministry of Magic psychopath and evtnually replaced as Headmaster. No one believes Harry that the dark lord is back so he must lead a rebellion in secret called "The Order of the Pheonix".  More and more does it become clear that Harry and Lord Voldemort are connected. With the help of his godfather, Professor Snape, and other Order of the Pheonix members, Harry must fight back and vindicate both himself and Dumbledoor. New characters, like Luna Lovegood, bring an air of comic relief in a darker story than before.</p></body></html>

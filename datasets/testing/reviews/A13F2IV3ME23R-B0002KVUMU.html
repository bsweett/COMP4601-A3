Not perfection.<br /><br />The characters were excellent - and droll - and in some cases, gross.<br /><br />This is great fantasy! Without being offensive!<br /><br />Van Helsing's blades are a bit remaniscent[?] of the Predator's blades.  Go, guys!<br /><br />chuckle. Guess Dracula's offspring had as much chance of survival as the Alien Queen's did.<br /><br />This is one I will be viewing again - I know I must have missed some neat parts.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [especially if you have been a comic buff] this is great guns.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A New Kind of Bank Robbing Movie"></head><body><p>Remember when Woody Allen released Match Point last year and instantly revamped his career, probably because the whole tone of the film had changed from his previous efforts. Here Spike Lee basically does that; He's not revamping his career, because it's been fine...But this movie has a whole different tone from Lee's previous films. And that's a good thing, because this is a very smart film that throws constant plot twists while always staying true to what's going on. Bank robbing movies are hard to do now a days. Not movies about bank robbers who rob banks occasionally in the movie (Bandits); I'm talking full-on entire movie in the bank, bank robbing movies. Back in the 70's "Dog Day Afternoon" pretty much wrote the book on those kinds of movies and how they should be; I don't think that films been topped. But this film (which also does something out of the ordinary in referencing bank robbing movies such as the aformentioned one) does something different with the bank robbery genre. The movie opens like the Johnny Depp film The Libertine did. A character, in this case Dalton Russel (Clive Owen), stares directly into the camera and explains that he's going to rob a bank for two reasons. One, because of the financial aspect and two, because he can. In the next few moments we watch a team of bank robbers, wearing masks and disguised as painters, storm into a bank in New York and commence the robbery. As soon as the cops get wind of it, it turns into Dog Day Afternoon outside the banks sans the media and screaming fans. Leading the pack of hostage negotiators is Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), a smart detective who see's something isn't quite right with the robbery. Christopher Plummer co-stars as the CEO of the bank Arthur Case, who's hiding something in one of the safety desposit boxes; Jodie Foster co-stars as Madeleine, the woman hired by Case to keep the contents of the safety desposit box secret; And Willem Dafoe stars as Captain John Darius, another cop involved in the hostage situation. The ending is really smartly done and believable in the context of the film. This is entertaining, smart, and very good.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

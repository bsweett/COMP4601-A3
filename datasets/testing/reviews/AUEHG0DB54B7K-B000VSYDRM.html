<meta name="summary" content="A Perfect Perfume"></head><body><p>I read Patrick Suskind's Perfume when it was published in English in 1986.  When I heard over the years that a movie version was planned I never thought it would become reality.  I was always a little uncertain how Grenouille would be presented since he is hardly a hero.  The film is an excellent adaptation of the book with a remarkable performance by Ben Whishaw as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.  Mr. Whishaw manages to convey the "otherness" of Grenouille; a feeling he conveys that he is different and an outsider.  He is relegated to his own world of smells and has no need to communicate with people.  The gaunt appearance that Mr. Whishaw achieves is perfect for his character.  It is equally interesting to see his passions aroused when he first detects the scent of a young woman selling fruit.  He truly comes alive and when he accidentally kills the girl his reaction is like a child that has killed a favorite pet; he does not know that he has done anything wrong: he had to relish the scent of the girl.<br /><br /> Dustin Hoffman makes an interesting Giuseppe Baldini.  His nose is perfect for a perfumer and he does quite well with the role although his accent does not sound terribly Italian.  Alan Rickman is superb as Antoine Richis and Rachel Hurd-Wood, as his daughter Antoine Richis, is very attractive and entirely convinces you that she is an intelligent young woman who would rather do without marriage to the well-meaning but much older Marquis de Montesquieu.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent and beautifully fit into their characters.  The production is first rate and is entirely convincing from the start that you are in 18th century France with all of its squalor and filth.  The CGI effects are quite good, particularly the bridge where Baldini has his shop.  John Hurt lends his mellifluous voice to the film as the narrator, helping to fill us in on Grenouille's workings and motives.<br /><br />If you have read the book I think you will enjoy the film unconditionally.  For people who have not read the book, I hope you will find the experience a journey of the imagination.  While this is not a morality tale perhaps the moral of this story is that we cannot live (as Grenouille understands in the end) without love and be whole.</p></body></html>

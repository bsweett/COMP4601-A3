They have had all of the conversations about what is to come from their future; things look good until one night. Brooke feels that Gary does not participate well enough in the relationship. She feels that she goes above and beyond her duty and not only does he fail to meet her halfway, he does not appreciate what she does for him. She breaks up with him.<br /><br />Now she must do everything in her womanly power to make him realize that he needs to make some changes in his life and want to win himself back into her favor. But is it that simple?<br /><br />My expectations were relatively low. To my knowledge, the movie has not been reviewed well in most circles. Some people expect it to be 100% "chick flick." Some people expect it to be 100% Vince Vaughn hilarity. The reality falls somewhere south of the latter and to the left of the former.<br /><br />The movie was absolutely hilarious...until their first fight - the break-up fight. The movie then took on a serious tone for the next 20-30 minutes. It was a sharp contrast from the raucous laughter that spewed from the audience as the movie began. The laughs that came throughout the remainder of the movie were hearty, though sporadic.<br /><br />I had heard that it was not a great date movie. Various scenes harp on not-so-subtle idiosyncrasies exhibited by both men and women in relationships. Apparently there has been some trouble caused among viewers who then have things pointed out that they relate to their own mate. My feelings are that maybe this could be true if you are in a middle stage of a relationship. If you are early you have not seen signs of anything yet that could be highlighted in the movie and if you are late in the game you are over it by now. But I do pass along the warning anyway.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn was great. Vince Vaughn's humor was somewhat of an amalgamation of other roles he has played. He had relationship insight like he did in Wedding Crashers and some right-on-time trash talk like he did in Swingers. I will continue to tout him as the new Bill Murray. He does the slapstick, sophomoric humor; he does serious drama; he does touching chick flick. He is very likeable on screen. So far anyway, he has the Midas Touch.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston, in many scenes, has never looked better. I do not expect to see her name attached to any blockbuster roles, but she does well in this chick-flick niche. She is well suited to the characters in the genre.<br /><br />Welcome back to movies, Joey Lauren Adams. She put on a few pounds and looks good. Her role was small, but she did a good job as the nagging friend whose advice is misinterpreted by Brooke.<br /><br />Vincent D'Onofrio takes on another quirky role like the one he played in Thumbsucker. The characters were vastly different, but it seems that Mr. D'Onofrio is stretching his artistic legs a little. It was a small part, but he did well.<br /><br />As if Joey Lauren Adams' reincarnation wasn't enough, Cole Hauser came out of the woodwork. Probably the only thing you've seen him in was Dazed and Confused, and after that role you did not expect to see him in anything ever again. Though he did have a small roll in Tigerland, which is a fantastic movie.<br /><br />Jon Favreau was great. I love to see Favreau and Vaughn interact on screen. I still picture Mikey and Trent (Swingers) when the witty banter begins.<br /><br />The movie was good, not great. I may never see it again, but it was entertaining enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elvis and JFK vs The Mummy......you WILL believe!"></head><body><p>I must admit right off the top that I've never been a big Bruce Campbell fan at all.I have found his acting to be pedestrian at best with just one or two "tricks" he invariably uses in every role he plays.This role however has made me rethink Bruce Campbell and his abilities.<br />Bruce plays an aging Elvis who has wound up in a nursing home,wondering where his life all went wrong and what the heck that "thing" is on his,er well,private parts! He shows a great range in his portrayal here and he leaves you convinced he is "The King".<br />He becomes a reluctant ally with another nursing home inhabitant by the name of John Kennedy,the past president.This role is played beautifully by veteran actor Ossie Davis who also convinvces you,skin colour included,that he is who he portrays.<br />Both find themselves pitted against a mummy who is using this seniors home as a "feeding" ground for collecting souls.A Fox who has had free reign in the proverbial henhouse,you might say, until he is found out and comes up against two decrepit but committed post-famous geriatrics.<br />The film is,when all said and done,a battle of good-against-evil thriller with some wonderful and original twists but there is something else.The thread of life in nursing homes and just how seniors are treated by staff and visitors alike winds its' uncomfortable way through this picture meshing in well with on going events.At times though it almost threatens to slow the pace and narrative up but there is enough of the major theme to keep it rolling steadily along.<br />This movie is one that just does not rush itself.It has a story to tell you,events and people that it wants you to come to know and when the payoff comes around everything ends well and as it should.Patience is the key word here but it pays off in spades.Special mention also goes to the roles of Elvis'nurse and to the two undertakers who have a running gag throughout the film.<br />I recommend this movie highly.Kudos to Mr Davis and especially a tip of the derby to Mr Campbell who does a surprisingly expert job in his portrayal here.A deliberately paced horror flick with some wonderful and surprisingly original twists on an old theme.</p></body></html>

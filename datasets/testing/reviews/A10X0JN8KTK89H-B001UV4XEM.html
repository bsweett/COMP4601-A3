<meta name="summary" content="A well-woven pastiche of previous comedies"></head><body><p>Certainly, there are some very funny characters and scenes in this film, but it feels like a patchwork of road trip movies you've seen before.  The movie succeeds in creating a silly comedy mystery of the absurd, and I admit I laughed often.  Too often, however, I could see the punch line from a mile away.  The movie is a series of neatly crafted punch lines without a compelling overriding comedy.  That is, every joke is the same or a more extreme variation on the same.  And so, the movie was more of an over-hyped letdown than a more genre-critical tour de force like Tropic Thunder.  I compare the two movies because they rely on the audience's previous knowledge of comedy film history, but Tropic Thunder succeeds in delivering actual Hollywood criticism where The Hangover manages the singular enticement of mere gross-out humor.  While I don't find the film to be a classic in any sense, I would still recommend it to anyone in need of a good laugh.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Roland Zwick (below) summed it up perfectly."></head><body><p>"Wedding Crashers" is a reasonably funny movie, but not really hilarious. It feels like an extended-length, R-rated episode of a TV sitcom, with a few bare breasts and some raunchy language added. I only laughed three or four times. The funniest part, for me, was the brief segment with Will Ferrell (uncredited) near the end of the movie.  Worth a shot if you like light buddy-style romantic comedies.</p></body></html>

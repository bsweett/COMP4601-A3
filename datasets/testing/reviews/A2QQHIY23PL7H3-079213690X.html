<meta name="summary" content="A standard-setting epic"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson really nailed it with this big screen telling of the William Wallace legend. There are some liberties taken with historical facts, but overall the film presents all the heart, drama, and scale you'd want from a historical epic, and does it well with a three-hour running time that never feels padded or boring. The film also set a modern standard for melee brawls of combatants rushing head-on into each other, with lots of brutality, gore, and tight editing. It's the measuring stick by which all later films went up against, and the fight sequence everyone since has worked hard to outdo (see Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy).<br /><br />The dvd gives us the full three hours of the film without interruption like those old pesky VHS tapes. Picture and audio quality are good (considering the disc was released years ago), and we get two major supplements. A behind-the-scenes documentary provides some good tidbits and on-set footage, and the Mel Gibson commentary track is a laid back-yet-informative affair. There's not much in terms of quantity, but what we get covers the bases surprisingly well.<br /><br />A great movie for any collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Saturday night movie..."></head><body><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is an entertaining romp of action, adventure, and yes, even comedy.  Vince Vaughan plays a supporting role, perhaps a bit too small, but he provides the comedic relief.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith.  They are married to each other yet live completely separate lives as hired assassins.  They are both hired to kill...each other.  Sounds rather silly, but I think it was done pretty well.  It was well paced, filled with great action, snappy dialogue, and also quite stylish at that.<br /><br />"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a fun film to rent on any night.  I just happened to watch it on Saturday.</p></body></html>

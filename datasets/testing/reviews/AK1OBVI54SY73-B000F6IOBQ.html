<meta name="summary" content="One Word: Boring!"></head><body><p>All right, I never was a huge fan of Underworld in the first place, I felt the movie was just really all flash but it had an interesting enough plot and went at a pretty exciting pace.<br /><br />This sequel though was boring! I mean that is the one word that came to my mind when the credits finally came on. By the time the ending came, I could have cared less about any of the characters because honestly they all annoyed me. The characters were basically doing what they were doing in the first movie- trying to act all cool and thus coming off seriously wooden, and for some reason this attitude continuing in the sequel just makes the acting seem even worse. The fighting scenes seemed no different than the first movie's ones, definitely nothing that'll make you go 'wow' or anything. This movie seriously starts to drag, or anyway I got this feeling towards the end of the film that I really, really wanted the movie to finish soon. My interest for the movie left even before an hour into the film honestly.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the first Underworld over the sequel. The sequel is nothing worth watching. It drags, the acting is pretty weak, and the plot itself, though sounds interesting, turns to out to be nothing amazing. I don't plan on watching it again.<br /><br />2/5 stars only.</p></body></html>

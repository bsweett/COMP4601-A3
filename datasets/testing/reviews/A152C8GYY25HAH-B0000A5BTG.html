<meta name="summary" content="Sci-fi thriller fails on almost every level"></head><body><p>As I have said before, one key to a great thriller is to get the audience to suspend disbelief. After such a movie is over, you might think back on how illogical or improbably it all was. You might even watch it again to see how the filmmakers tricked you into buying the plot. Likewise, great action-adventure movies [especially those with great special effects] are such a thrill ride that you overlook or forgive ludicrous characters, inane dialog and comic script construction. For me, "The Core" failed as either a thriller or as escapist entertainment. <p>The movie's title refers to the earth's core - the vast cauldron of molten rock that lies a few miles underneath our planet's surface. As the film starts, random electromagnetic storms are happening all over the world. It turns out that the core is starting to stop spinning, and if man doesn't do something quickly, the planet is toast. As luck would have it, a scientist has invented a ship that can bore through to the core, and it's up to a stalwart [American, of course!] crew to get on board this craft and SAVE THE PLANET!<p>Admittedly, this story line is no dumber than that of "Armageddon" or "Independence Day", but here the special effects are, at best, cheesy and the actors seem especially embarrassed to have taken roles in which the pay checks, rather than the performances, are what's important. Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci and others completely waste their time and ours. <p>I have read reviews by people who defend "The Core" by claiming that dumb movies are dumb movies. I see their point, but to me, there are `good' dumb movies and `bad' dumb movies. "The Core" is in the `bad' category.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A movie doesn't even worth to be watched once!"></head><body><p>I've Ridden most of the reviews about this movie and I've got surprised cause I can't find even one positive point in this movie! This is difinately one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The worse move I've seen was Creature from the Haunted sea! Let's Talk about Negative points :<br /><br />1. Actings were horrible! I may cause of that all of the scenes were computer graphic generated and actors couldn't feel later CG Environment around them<br /><br />2. Montaging Actors in CG environment was extremely poor and actors were not seem as a part of environment but but some prominent motion beings in front it!<br /><br />3. CGs were not sophisticated. nothing looked like natural and CGs inspired you to feel that you are watching a computer Game demo!<br /><br />4. Story was extremely Ridicolous with no facts! I felt that the director of this movie was a child with huge budget who wants to bring to reality his childish dreams and games! If this movie had made in 50s, It could be acceptable but nowadays with Fact seeking people and Computer generation youth, making such ridicolous movies can consider as an insult!<br /><br />5. I don't know what was the problem of directors with colors. this movie in full colors could be much more toloratable! It was not totally black and white and it was not in full color either!<br /><br />6. I was a Dissapointing advertise for fallen British empire! I Don't know what was wrong with America that they Decided to Stick that flying air strips to Britain! Everyone knows without america, British couldn't sustain German attacks! Now they want to pretend that britain was always strong with super powers! I hate British and hate British accent more! Seem the British accent of Jude Law was not enough cause my favorite actress Angelina Jolie was trying to pretent that she was a British officer!<br /><br />Don't let the trailer fools you! this movie even not worth to watch once. instead of it, I suggest you watching LXG, which has rather same storyline but 1000 times better than this freak!</p></body></html>

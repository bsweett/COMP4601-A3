<meta name="summary" content="Carrie  (1976)"></head><body><p>Director:  Brian De Palma<br /><br />Cast:  Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, William Katt, Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, John Travolta, P.J. Soles, Priscilla Pointer.<br /><br />Running Time:  98 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, some gore, and language.<br /><br />Nowadays, we have literal truck loads of books on how to deal with our tormented teenage daughters. We all know in this day and age that teenage girls are wicked bullies and the damage inflicted by their relentless bullying is often irreparable. But you don't need those books. Most of us who have watched the film "Carrie" already know the devastating effect that merciless torment can have upon us. That's why we watched the film; to see those bullies get what they deserve and to cheer Carrie on every step of the way. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in a brilliant performance) is an abused teenager with a void where her self-esteem should be. Her mother (played by the over-the-top Piper Laurie) is a whacko religious nut who likes to violently throw Carrie around for imagined sins and lock her in the closet for days on end. Her schoolmates are spoiled rotten Clique Queens (played by Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles), who enjoy attacking anyone less popular than they are, for no reason at all other than that it amuses them. Carrie becomes their main target when her period, incredibly late, finally arrives one day in the locker room shower. Carrie, who has never been sexually educated and is under the impression that she is bleeding to death, freaks out and of course, her classmates find this terribly amusing.<br /><br />With her the onset of her menstrual cycle, her dormant powers of telekinesis suddenly wake and cannot be controlled anymore than her newly awakened raging hormones can be. Unfortunately, no one is aware of this. As Carrie dares to stand up to her mother and begins to break out of her shell, her cruel and sadistic classmates have a plan to keep her in her place forever. Too bad they don't know how dangerous all that suppressed anger can be. Carrie gets her revenge on them all and the climax of the film is a bloody, fiery apocalypse as Carrie unleashes her pent up anger along with her powers and literally lets them run their ferocious course. "Carrie" is not so much a horror film as it is a psychological one. The human mind is capable of horrors that no movie camera or special effects crew can reproduce, and the abused psyche is a monster that no one wants to see unleashed.<br /><br />"Carrie" is a melding of two great artists, in this case, Stephen King, who wrote the novel and Brian De Palma, who directed the film. This is a tense, exciting thriller that is also a sturdy character study. It's hard to make a film that can accomplish both, but De Palma does it.  King's novel mostly dealt with a telekinetic girl who is cruelly treated by her classmates. De Palma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen follow the novel fairly closely, with the exception of the ending, which is a great deal more sensationalistic and better (King himself liked the finale and the film, as stated in his exceptional study of the horror genre "Danse Macabre")  As is the case in most De Palma films, the technical credits are superb. The cinematography (by Mario Tosi)is extremely effective; colors and shadows have never been shot more effectively in a De Palma film since. The film score is by Pino Donaggio, and it marks the first collaboration between Donaggio and De Palma. (Bernard Herrmann died shortly after "Obsession" was completed) Donaggio is among the most underrated and overlooked composers of his time. His scores for "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and "Body Double" are all exceptional and all deserved Oscars. "Carrie" is no less brilliant, as it accomplishes what all great scores are supposed to do: enhance the film without giving anything away. Paul Hirsch's editing is also extremely effective as it was in "Sisters", "Obsession", "Blow Out" and "Raising Cain".  But it is the performances that make "Carrie" stand out. Carrie is played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of such power and strength that she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (the first actress ever to be nominated for a horror film; the second would be Sigourney Weaver for "Aliens").  She manages to hit all the right notes. A lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama. Spacek plays the role more realistically and the film is much more effective that way.  "Carrie" is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. "Carrie" is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not The Type To Obstinately Dig-In When Wrong"></head><body><p>I'm not the type to obstinately dig-in when I'm proven wrong.<br /><br />So I admit - I was wrong in dismissing this follow-up to the Ang Lee disaster.<br /><br />That first Hulk movie was just about the most blatant example of celluloid excrement I can think of when the category is 'super hero'. Admittedly, 'Superman's III and IV' and the moronic Joel Shumacher '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOXO">Batman</a>' films certainly requires liberal doses of liquid brain bleach when screened. But I've always categorized those as infantile satire - not real films.<br /><br />No question Lee has talent - none. But let's be honest and say there are obvious limits to that talent. And his attempt at the world of comicdom is where that line exists. Sans flying kung fu priestesses and lonely men in tents, the first incarnation of the Hulk redefined the term "the living dead" - as most of the audience, including myself, were virtually flatlined having sat through that mind-numbing crapfest.<br /><br />An announced revamp of the entire project did little to recharge my enthusiasm. There was absolutely no way I was going to go through another monstrosity without the monster. A difficult decision given how much of a fan I am all the actors attached to the sequel; most especially Tim Roth, a favorite performer. But I usually make an effort to avoid the axiom definition of insanity.<br /><br />Fast forward four years. Just screened '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083SBMBM">Marvel's: The Avengers</a>'. Wow - incredible film!<br /><br />My curiosity was piqued. Watch the only original Avenger flick that I intentionally avoided? Take the chance of being ticked off again at expending funds and, more importantly, wasting time screening another pile?<br /><br />Ah screw it.<br /><br />Couple of hours later - I was wrong.<br /><br />This was not bad. Not bad at all. It wasn't quite the quality of the '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JMSIRC">Iron Man</a>' films, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P8A">Thor</a>' or '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IZLPMY">Captain America</a>' - but it was close. And any improvement from the Lee disaster would be reason to celebrate. So I'm giving a lot of credit to Director Louis Leterrier. He saved the character from the well-deserved bitterness directed at the utter failure of the first film.<br /><br />Had a decently fun time and, more importantly, I was able to engage the characters this time around. Bruce, Betsy, William Hurt's lesser interpretation of General Ross (Sam Elliot was the lone performance from the original that I enjoyed) and even the fully CGI'd Other Guy.<br /><br />The script struck the right blend of action and thoughtful insight - bringing us into the terrible existence of Dr. Banner as he runs, hiding in various third-world bleep holes, desperately trying to avoid the relentless pursuit by the government. The refreshing plot proposition that he's "property" owned by the United States, and not a man with an illness, certainly added unexpected depth to the story.<br /><br />Additionally, the clever nods to the original television Hulk - incorporating Joe Harnell's haunting soundtrack, the rain soaked walking man, and other fun cameos added a lot of value to the rental fee. However, I do kinda wish the filmmakers showed what happened to Stan Lee when he drank that very special bottle.  :-D<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- Again, having recently watched 'The Avengers', I noticed the calendar. Almost a full decade had passed since that terrible first film. Amazing how much better, how much more improved the character was when Mark Ruffalo took on the role. Proof that some particularly adept directors, like Joss Whedon, can learn from the mistakes of others. I'm always amazed that some directors actually listen to fans; they're usually so high on themselves, disconnected from reality - i.e. Joel Shumacher - that nothing penetrates their egos.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- Disliked one of the plot threads because it was left unanswered: What happened to Bruce's dog? As a person who considers the four-legged ones his kids, stuff like this tends to irritate. Would you forget your kid? Just sayin'.</p></body></html>

Not only does the film seem utterly real in its recreation of NASA and space exploration; it  also gives us breathless, second-by-second suspense and real characters to  care about, played by some of the best actors Hollywood has to offer. Ron  Howard should have won the Best Director Oscar for this film; that he  wasn't even nominated will remain one of the greatest black marks against  the Academy in its entire history. (At least the Directors' Guild didn't  slip up, and gave Howard its award that year.)</p></body></html>

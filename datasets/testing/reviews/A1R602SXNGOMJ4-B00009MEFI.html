It didn't cost an arm and a leg to make, it stars some good actors and the story line was plausible.<br /><br />I love the film phone booth. I think it is very clever that for an 80 minutes the film can hold one character in a phone booth and keep the story going without boring the viewers.  Colin Farrell is brilliant as an arrogant PR guy that goes through a range of emotions, and comes out the other side a better person, and with keifer Sutherland as the sniper that keeps him trapped there, that was excellent casting because he has such a chilling voice.<br /><br />It's hard to make a movie work when it takes place in a confined space with few characters, but when those movies succeed, it shows. And that's how it is with "Phone Booth."<br /><br />The cast and crew did a terrific job considering the film was shot over only 10 days. I would suggest to anyone that hasn't seen this film to do so, cause it not so far outside the possibility that it could happen to you. which makes it great.</p></body></html>

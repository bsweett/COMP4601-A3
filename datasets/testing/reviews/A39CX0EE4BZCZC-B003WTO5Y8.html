<meta name="summary" content="A Story And A Character That You Can't Forget"></head><body><p>I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.<br /><br />I actually read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.  Today, after a half-dozen viewings, I still find it fascinating.<br /><br />This movie is not for the squeamish and there is some extreme crudeness in the story but I suspect everyone knows that by now. What I've always liked best was the by-play between "Dr. Lecter" and "Clarice." The looks on Hopkins' face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.<br /><br />"Silence Of The Lambs" has turned into a modern-day "classic." If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.</p></body></html>

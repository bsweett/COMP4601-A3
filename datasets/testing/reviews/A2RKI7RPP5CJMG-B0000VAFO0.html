<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, But There's Nothing New Here"></head><body><p>"Underworld" is fun to watch, but it's really nothing more than an average sci-fi/action flick.  One thing is for sure, this movie is in no way a horror film.  Take any standard action yarn, replace the good guys with vampires and the bad guys with werewolves.  Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.  Finally, blend in a betrayal and a cover-up and you basically have the storyline.  There's nothing new here.<br /><br />The two supernatural enemies really don't even use their powers against each other that much.  The "death dealer" vampires have more guns than a cult in Waco.  They don't even get close to ripping open the necks of their enemies. The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from "Fight Club" in the city's subway tunnels.<br /><br />Don't think that this flick isn't enjoyable, though.  It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.  I just wish that the vamps and wolves could have used their powers a little more than their guns.  The betrayal and cover-up mentioned earlier does actually make you pull for one side of the conflict a little more than the other, but in the end, you just want to see these folks beat the heck out of each other until someone yells, "Uncle!"<br /><br />If you want real vampire or werewolf action, check out a movie like "Interview With The Vampire"(better yet, read the book), or "Silver Bullet"(again, the book is better).  If you just want a little brainless action, "Underworld" will suffice.</p></body></html>

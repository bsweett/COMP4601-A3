<meta name="summary" content="Realistic now!!!"></head><body><p>I remember seeing this back in 1996 when it first came out, my wife loved it, & being a fan of Bill Paxton, I thought it was good, the special effects really blow you away, & you feel like you are in a tornado, but at the time, it seemed unreal from a logical stand point, I mean how many tornados can you encounter in a single day? well, now I can say this movie is real, I experienced this in Tennessee yesterday(4/7/2006) eight of them touched down here in Tennessee, & I personally witnessed one, & DO NOT want to again, I have a greater appreciation for this film now, it is real, it is as close to a real tornado that you will get if you haven't already, I did for the first time yesterday, & it was no fun!!, but this film is though!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb and SMARTLY written!!!"></head><body><p>Whoever wrote this movie was definitely in a zone to which every writer should aspire but few truly reach. I was admittedly bored with the pace of this story from time to time, but the brilliant acting of Edward Norton and Jessica Biel (to say nothing of Paul Giamatti and others) was positively enrapturing! I couldn't have turned this movie off if I had tried. I kept wanting to know what would happen next.<br /><br />I'm usually very good about seeing an ending coming. I can honestly say I did NOT see this ending coming. Anyone that did is a much better movie watcher than I! Or maybe you're just psychic. Either way, my enjoyment of this movie reached its peak when I was slapped in the face by this wonderfully surprising ending.<br /><br />I do think they could have developed some characters a bit more, but perhaps the mystery was part of the point. MAYBE that's what allows the viewer to become such a prisoner to this movie. So I'm torn. But I was also completely entertained! I knew NOTHING of this movie before viewing it but wow! I'm glad I did!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Had No Idea a Tornado Can "Growl"????"></head><body><p>I love disaster flicks. As a kid in the 1970's I loved whenever George Kennedy stepped onboard an airplane....you just knew that sucker wasn't making it to it's destination! How about "Earthquake", "Meteor" or "Towering Inferno"...loved 'em all. With the 80's disaster flicks kind of disappeared. The all-star casts shifted their attention to "Fantasy Island" and "The Love Boat" I guess? Anywho, once the millenium began to approach in the late 90's, Disaster flicks began popping up once again. And to make it better, special effects progressed from models and miniatures to full blow CGI mega-disasters.<br />With "Twister" coming out in 1996, you get a fun little flick about a group of "storm chasers" hanging out in Oklahoma during tornado season. The basic storyline is that they want to launch a new piece of equipment to study tornadoes from the inside. Basically a trash can full of Pokemon orbs. To do this, they must set the unit in front of a rampaging tornado. So we get Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Jami Gertz & Philip Seymour Hoffman running around the midwest farm country in a beat-up caravan meeting all kinds of cool CGI tornadoes. Luckily (or unluckily depending on your viewpoint), they do this on the same day that about 20 tornadoes decide to ravage a 15 or 25 square mile area of Oklahoma.<br />Sure it's unrealistic, but the special effects are cool. I did chuckle to myself when watching this disk on my TV with surround sound. I never noticed there was a "growling" sound effect added whenever a tornado appeared. This is a fun, summer movie and not to be taken too seriously. Like most good disaster movies, the special effects are the biggest draw. Whether it's flying cows, flying oil tanker trucks, farmhouses rolling around like tumbleweeds or watching a Drive-in movie screen disintergrate, there really is only one reason to watch "Twister"...and that to see things get destroyed. And this movie delivers big time.</p></body></html>

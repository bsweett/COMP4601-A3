The idea of being drugged, kidnapped, tortured, and killed by people who are paying to do it, is a great concept for a film. It's just too bad that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be.<br /><br />It starts off like "Eurotrip" or any number of cheesy teen sex comedies. Lots of nudity and a number characters acting idiotic and giddy, in a fake atmosphere. Scenes in dance clubs that don't look realistic. Anyway, this goes on and on until the bloodshed starts, giving us absolutely no reason to feel anything for the main characters.Then it turns into the horror film it should be. The scenes of torture are effective and psychologically scary if you imagine yourself in the situation, but in the context of the rest of this movie it just becomes ineffective.<br /><br />The music is terrible. Not in the fact that the music itself isn't good, but for the fact that, A: it doesn't fit the movie, and B: There's way too much of it. There's a scene where the Characters are merely walking across a courtyard, and the music sounds like it should be a fight scene in `Harry Potter.' Completely out of place and distracting, further telling you this is just a movie no need to feel anything for the characters or get scared.Then the end of the movie turns into an unrealistic revenge fantasy that's played out, for the most part, for laughs. So is the movie supposed to be realistic, scary, or funny? Its falls short of any of these things. Eli Roth needs to pick one and do it.<br /><br />You can do a good compare and contrast between this movie and "Wolf Creek" Everything that is wrong with "Hostel", was done right in "Wolf Creek". Both movies are about young travelers getting into horrifying situations; however in "Wolf Creek" the characters actually act like normal human beings therefore you feel disgusted when they get tortured and killed. It's genuinely frightening and realistic, and by all means not "fun" to watch. It makes you feel horrible inside. It's REALISTIC HORROR. I gave "Hostel" 1 stars for a frightening concept and the quick cameo of the famous Japanese director Takashi Miike probably for giving input on the torture scene which he is so infamous for.<br /><br />Realism, Eli.  Please more realism next time.</p></body></html>

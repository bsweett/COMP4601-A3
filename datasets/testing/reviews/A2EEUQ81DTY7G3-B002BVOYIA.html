<meta name="summary" content="Oh that's terrible,' and they'll go on eating their dinners"></head><body><p>Full of tension and turmoil, with one of 2004's best performances by Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda could probably be forgiven for a somewhat mawkish ending. Because the movie stands alone as a great emotional drama and tells of a terrible time in African history where genocide was committed on a vast scale and where the Western world largely ignored what was going on. Now, for the first time, the West can really see the atrocities that were committed on such a large scale.<br /><br />Don Cheadle plays the real life Paul Rusesabagina a smart, focused hotel manager of the Mille Collines, the Belgian-owned luxury hotel in Kigali. Paul is caught up in a nation consumed in ethnic strife, when the ruling Hutu tribe begins the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis in Rwanda during a 100-day bloodbath in 1994.  The Tutsis are considered" cockroaches" and deserve to be slaughtered, but the problem is that many Westerners can't tell the difference. Paul himself is even married to one, the beautiful soft-spoken Tatiana (played with astounding authenticity be Sophie Okonedo).<br /><br />Together with their children, they narrowly escape death many times, as Paul is forced to bribe their very survival. He was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. Cheadle portrays Paul as a smart, sophisticate, who keeps his cool under stress and who understands power, and has a cynical knowledge of the machinations of the outside world. He thinks fast, and can trade favors, whether it is trading U.S. currency to keep his friends alive, or giving jewelry, single-malt Scotch, and Cuban cigars to the local police force to keep the hotel and the refugees safe.<br /><br />There are some wonderful moments in this movie. In one scene there's a bitter conversation where Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) a brusque United Nations soldier. Tells Paul that he's dirt and worth nothing because he's black, and worse a black African. The Colonel, in a fit of helplessness, ultimately blames racism for Western indifference to the Rwandan nightmare. In another scene, Paul, at the last second, decides to remain at the hotel while his wife and children are transported to safety in a United Nations convoy. Minutes later that convoy is raided by the Interahamwe.<br /><br />For a film about genocide there's surprisingly little violence - just enough for the viewer to get a pretty accurate picture of what actually went on. Bodies are strewn everywhere, and there are no hideous mutilations shown - everything is kind of sanitized through a hazy fog. But scenes of military trucks packed with cheering, violence fuelled machete-waving soldiers is enough to keep the viewer on edge.<br /><br />The West's reaction to the drama comes from disparate radio reports, and often in the form of dialogue between the main characters. All the performances are outstanding, and the producers have done an excellent job of recreating the claustrophobic atmosphere of the hotel, where Paul is forced to take care of hundreds of refugees who are sleeping in the corridors, and outside by the pool. Hotel Rwanda is not a great film, but it does do a terrific job of showing how violence and chaos can erupt without warning almost anywhere. Mike Leonard January 05.</p></body></html>

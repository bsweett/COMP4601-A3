Unlike his other movies, Ridley Scott's story telling on this one fell flat.  Action and cinematography were on par as usual.  However, I just could not find a compelling reason for the crusaders in this film.  It seemed all the activities and scenes were built up just so Orlando Bloom could have his big save-the-day moment on screen.<br /><br />It was just a little too convenient that a blacksmith, who had just lost his wife and daughter, would suddenly have a noble Lord and crusader show up at his doorstep claiming to be his father asking him to join the crusades. Why does the nobleman show up now of all times after never seeing his son for several years? The plot seemed too easily set up.<br /><br />Bloom very quickly becomes disillusioned by the real intentions of the crusaders, but he seems to let it go as if unphased by it all.  He's just hanging around Jerusalem, building up his farm until it is time for him to make a difference.<br /><br />So what is the movie supposed to be about?  Is is about a man who had lost all hope and manages to find himself by embarking on a spiritual mission? Is it about Muslims and Christians being able to live in peace after all?  The themes switch back and forth.  Is there supposed to be a theme?<br /><br />Sorry Ridley and Orlando, stick to what you know.</p></body></html>

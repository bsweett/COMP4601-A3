In depicting the collapse of a psychotic dictator, it also details the demise of National Socialism and the transfixed personalities that enabled it. And it treats all this with an uncommon fidelity to fact, a feat of detection and dedication for which future researchers will be indebted, that is not to say moved and enthralled. It's not a pretty picture but it is a powerful one.<br /><br />The filmmakers move between the melodrama in the besieged bunker, where Adolf Hitler and his cohorts are delusionally in command, to the anguish and chaos in the streets of Berlin. It is there that German soldiers and fleeing civilians encounter the advancing Russian "liberators," armed resistance, and exploding bombs. The camera scrutinizes the lair-like claustrophobia of the Third Reich's last throes and the agony and bewilderment of those entangled in it.<br /><br />Alec Guinness and Anthony Hopkins have played Hitler, but their performances pale beside that of Bruno Ganz, who now owns the role (an odd distinction for an actor.) Ganz gives us the humanity behind the horror, rendering the madman and his mission as weirdly comprehensible (Hannah Arendt's famous "banality of evil.") As a result, some criticize Ganz's achievement and the picture itself as "humanizing the inhuman." Yet that is the very point the movie is making.<br /><br />"Downfall" is based partly on the memoirs of Hitler's young secretary, a major character in the film whose real-life persona is seen briefly commenting at the beginning and end. The director could have done a better job identifying the characters as they come and go (was that Martin Borman?), but the actors playing them couldn't be any better. This splendid DVD comes with a commentary tract and extras that are as engrossing as the film itself. Miss this one at your own risk.</p></body></html>

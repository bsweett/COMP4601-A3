<meta name="summary" content="Just Too Darn Funny To Get Old"></head><body><p>After watching this third installment of the Austin Powers film series, one can't help but wonder how director Jay Roach can get by with using the same type of humor for three go-'rounds.  Well, the answer is simple: The characters are just too darn funny to get old!<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Goldmember" sees Austin Powers (Mike Myers) once again battling Dr. Evil (Myers), this time with 1970s "supervillain" Goldmember (Myers), a spoof of the classic James Bond villain Goldfinger, thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Once again, the same basic jokes and tone of humor is used in this effort, but it just never seems to get old in the least.  Plus, more of an actual storyline (dealing with "daddy issues") is present in this one than in its two predecessors.  New characters Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) & Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce) also add a bit of spice to the cast.<br /><br />Overall, this film simply keeps the Austin Powers comedy ball rolling.  It may have slipped a tiny bit from "The Spy Who Shagged Me", but nowhere near enough to drop it a star ranking.</p></body></html>

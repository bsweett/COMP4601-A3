<meta name="summary" content="Everything that you would expect in an intense action film is HERE!"></head><body><p>Okay, this is one of those action films that really works. Alongside Speed & Face/Off, Die Hard is superb as it delivers a whole lot of high-octane action. The story is...well, who really cares about the story? You already know that it's a bit cliched and doesn't really offer anything fresh. But what's so obviously great about this film is the action. The gunfights and the explosions (as well as the stunt work) are spectacular, and many of the action sequences still hold up today. Both Bruce Willis & Alan Rickman are excellent as the hero & villain, though I do think that the villain here, named Gruber, is way more interesting than Willis himself. Rickman's character is still the best villain in the entire Die Hard series, and his suave but cynical appearance/personality is proof of that. So basically, Die Hard is one of those action films that you MUST see before you die. It's got what you would expect in an action film: intense gun battles, clever dialogue, and a mano-a-mano between Willis and Rickman. The only problem is the music, which can be quite over-the-top at times. But still, this film is solid.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Finale Of A Wonderful Trilogy Story"></head><body><p>After so many years they've finally released the third and final Toy Story movie and like many others have said probably the best of the three and the most tear jerking emotional of them all.  AS you see that Andy has finally grown up and now starts his life going to college the toys wonder what's going to happen to them and as you see the situations and shenanigans they get into we make you laugh as you see the incredible CGI animation that is this movie,  but also they have a wonderful moral built into the movie as well that make it a wonderful movie for both kids and adults to watch.  All the characters and voice cast are back for this final movie which was great as they sometimes have to get new voices because of previous commitments that the actors and actresses have made with prior deals an the like but luckily this wasn't the case.  All I can say is if you've seen the other two movies this is a must see and while you get the laughter you'll also have some tear jerking scenes too though the ending while somewhat sad is also heart warming as you see what happens and the choice one former boy now a young man makes.  Also hopefully they end this trilogy here as they don't try and make it a cash cow like they've done with the Shrek franchise...</p></body></html>

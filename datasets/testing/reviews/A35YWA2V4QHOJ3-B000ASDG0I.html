<meta name="summary" content="Brad & Angie in action!"></head><body><p>First off, I have no idea what made this particular version un-rated.  Un-rated usually = nudity, but not in this case.  While the lovely Angelina has removed her clothes in other films (see GIA), she sadly keeps them on all the way thru this one.<br /><br />As for the plot, what came to mind as I was watching this film was someone taking a round-trip from New York to L.A. just to pick up a gallon of milk.  That's how circuitous it seemed.  To say it is far-fetched would be a major understatement.<br /><br />Of course, the selling-point of this film is not the absurd plot but the entertainment value.  On that mark, this movie does just fine.  There is plenty to like about two professional assasins who just-so-happen to be married & how they go after each other.  Surprisingly, it makes for some very funny moments, albeit in a sadistic sort of way.<br /><br />The biggest point of this movie, however, are the two actors.  Just about every male not named Tom Cruise would love to be Brad Pitt.  And, just about every non-lesbian woman would love to be WITH Brad Pitt.  Likewise, just about every woman not named Catherine Zeta-Jones would love to be Angelina Jolie.  And, of course, she is the kind of woman who visits the dreams of men such as myself.  So, it is this idea of two "perfect" people being married & yet trying to kill each other that is a big draw.  The fact that this movie spurred on a real-live romance only adds to the intrigue.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of action movies, action comedies,  Brad Pitt and / or Angelina Jolie, this movie is certainly worth a look.  People who like movies with a twisted sense of humor will also likely enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

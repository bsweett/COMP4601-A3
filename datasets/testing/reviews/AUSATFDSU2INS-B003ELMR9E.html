<meta name="summary" content="Sleepless in Alaska"></head><body><p>In Halibut, Alaska, the Sun doesn't' come down at nights. During the summer, its light illuminates for 24 hours and those who are not used to live such a bizarre situation, can develop a real bad case of sleeplessness.<br /><br />Inspector Will Dormer is just one of them.<br /><br />Just arrived from L.A., the detective has been called to this fishing town to resolve a terrible crime. Alongside his partner Eckhart and the local rookie Ellie Burr, Dormer has to uncover the identity of a 17 year old girl's killer.<br /><br />A remake of the 1997 Norwegian film, Insomnia offer a detailed look of a cop's mind, whose moral has been corrupted.<br /><br />The lack of sleep works as an explicit metaphor about a human being's incapacity of live with a dirty conscience. The moral debate, the intrigue and tension are elements that help to invigorate the plot. The somber tone of the characters is reflected masterfully with the portrayals of Williams and Pacino.<br /><br />Insomnia lets us see that not everything in life is black and white. Our experiences, generally, are a mix of grays. It also explores the reasons and motives of villains, and the vulnerabilities of heroes.<br /><br />At some point, inspector Dormer defines his position when affirms that "his job is to assign guilt". To decide whether he should do it by taking a look to the exterior world or to him is the most critic crossroad of this wonderful film.</p></body></html>

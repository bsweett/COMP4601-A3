<meta name="summary" content="Far Superior to the First Blu-Ray Release"></head><body><p>To coincide with the release of the 2012 remake, "Total Recall" has been resurrected on Blu-Ray from Lionsgate in the form of a "Mind Bending" Special Edition re-issue. The studio's original Blu-Ray was a poor, early-format effort, and this new AVC encoded 1080p transfer is a huge upgrade by comparison, even though the film itself doesn't appear flawless (with all the optical effects, it's no surprise that there's something of a slightly "dirty" aspect to the entire transfer). That said, the lack of DNR is quite welcome and the overall look hugely satisfying, with the transfer closely resembling Studio Canal's superior European Blu-Ray releases of the film (in fact it seems to be a new encoding of that older master). The DTS MA audio nicely represents Goldsmith's score, while extras - none of which were contained on the prior Blu-Ray - are rounded up from Lionsgate's old DVD releases.<br /><br />These include a chatty Verhoeven-Schwarzenegger commentary, which is wide-ranging and most interesting when it divulges the rocky development of the film, particularly the Bruce Beresford-directed version that was days away from shooting with star Patrick Swayze before DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group went under. There's also talk about the proposed "Total Recall 2" sequel that was supposed to adapt "Minority Report," while an interview with Verhoeven, 2001 "Imaging `Total Recall'" and special effects documentaries, the trailer, a photo gallery, and a restoration comparison round out a fine budget-priced Blu-Ray that's unquestionably better than the release that preceded it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There's better comic adaptations out there"></head><body><p>There are better comic book adaptations out there - Ghost Rider could have been a great dark movie along the lines of the original Batman.  Instead we got an interesting but not moving story, that had a few great action scenes, but not much unpredictability.  "How long do we have to wait until they take the girl as a hostage?"<br /><br />Nicolas Cage's quirky confused style worked better in Lords of War and other movies, but it didn't work here.  In the end you're not convinced he believes what he's saying - it's only as Ghost Rider that the character gains credibility.  On the casating upside, Sam Elliot was made for his role as the Caretaker, and former Easy Rider Peter Fonda was a sly (for lack of a better word) choice as the Devil.<br /><br />The CD we saw didn't have any extras.  Perhaps the 2 disc set does?</p></body></html>

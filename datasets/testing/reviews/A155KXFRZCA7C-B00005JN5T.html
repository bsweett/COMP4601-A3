<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing R-rated "humor""></head><body><p>I was excited and looking forward to see a nice comedy with a number of laughs, especially with the cast of Hoffman, DeNiro, Streisand, Stiller, etc. But after watching the trailer on TV over and over again, I must say the trailer was the best of this movie, as this flick goes downhill very fast. It's an embarrassing film with the sickest of Hollywood "humor." This flick should have received at least an "R" rating due to the continuous perverted adult content. It says a lot if in supposed-to-be "funny" scenes the whole theatre was quiet and nobody laughed. Sure, there were a few laughs here and there, but it was all messed up with the tasteless sick stuff this screenwriter put into it. Not just one scene, but one scene after the other as if the creator of this film really had a mental problem. And the script has a number of flaws as e.g. a trip from New York to Florida is played out in less than 5 minutes in the film. If you do want to see this film, don't take your kids with you -- it's absolutely not suitable. It's not the kind of comedy the trailer seems to indicate. And it is very likely that you will leave the theatre before this film is over as most folks did in the theatre that I went to. This is really sick stuff.</p></body></html>

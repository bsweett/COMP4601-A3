However, it's not quite that simple.  Jane (Jolie's character) thinks her husband John (Pitt's character), is in construction.  John is under the impression that he is married to a director of a Wall Street systems manager.  What they both don't know is that each is a professional assasin working for a rival firm.  They each take on a job to take out the same target, and the secret is revealed.<br /><br />This was a very interesting movie.  There is a ton of action.  Pitt and Jolie engage in fisticuffs and firefights, first with each other, and then with those sent to get them.  There is a great chase scene and some wonderful explosions.<br /><br />There is plenty of eye candy.  Pitt is suave and dashing in his tuxedo.  The guys get to drool over Jolie.  The onscreen chemistry between the two is quite good.<br /><br />Then there is the examination of marriage.  I thought this was well done.  The movie starts with John and Jane in a marriage counselor's office as they examine their relationship after five or six years of marriage (inside joke, watch the movie).  They both know there is something that is standing in the way of their relationship.  We, the viewers, know about their secret lives, but there is more than that.  The movie makes some subtle statements about what it takes to have a happy marriage, but the violent back drop is rather ironic.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this film.  I'm strangely fascinated by it, and I have watched it three times in one week.  Pitt and Jolie fans should be very pleased.  Action fans will enjoy the many shoot outs the film has to offer.  There is even a little something for romance fans.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  4.25 stars.</p></body></html>

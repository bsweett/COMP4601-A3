<meta name="summary" content="A "REAL" AMERICAN"></head><body><p>The late 60s and early 70s gave us a lot of different things to remember. Apparently one of them was the burgeoning business of drug dealing. While a number of drug smugglers came and went, there was one that made a killing, literally, during this time. His name was Frank Lucas and his story is told in this dynamic drama/biopic.<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as Lucas, the right hand man of criminal mastermind Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). When Bumpy passes away, Frank takes over his action in the streets of Harlem. At the same time, several others attempt to do the same. It only ends in a bloody finish with Frank on top.<br /><br />Looking for a way to make the sale of heroin more profitable, Frank decided to cut out the middle man and go direct. Via his cousin in Vietnam, he contacts one of the largest wholesale dealers there. The pair strike a deal and soon Frank is smuggling in large amounts, cutting it less than his competition and selling more and more.<br /><br />At the same time, an overly honest cop by the name of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is doing his best to put an end to the dope dealers. Disliked by other policemen because of his honesty (he even turns in $1,000,000 that he finds during a stake out), Frank is sought out by his supervisor when a drug task force is formed in New Jersey. Choosing their men carefully, the team sets out to take down the suppliers of drugs rather than the street hustlers.<br /><br />The paths of these two men will eventually cross, but the story revolves more around Frank Lucas. Frank brings in his brothers to back him in his business dealings and sales. He rules the streets with a savage brutality and at the same time does what he can to help the people of the neighborhood. These people look up to him full well knowing what it is he does for a living.<br /><br />Preferring to attract as little attention to himself as possible, a single night wearing a fur coat to a championship boxing event leads to Frank's picture being taken. This is the first step that Richie and his team take to discovering that Frank is the main supplier of heroin in the city. It is the first step in the end of Frank's reign of the streets.<br /><br />As always, Washington does a fantastic job in his performance here, exuding the cool, calculated ways of Frank Lucas as well as the outburst of anger and menace when times change. Crowe does an admirable job as well, showing Richie's discomfort with public speaking and his change, the confidence he gains as he reaches that moment where he captures the man behind the myth.<br /><br />Brutal, honest and a true story to boot, this movie is one that should be seen not only for the tale of two individuals but as a precautionary tale for anyone considering this lifestyle as well as the toll taken by heroin users. A bonus here is interviews with both the real life Richie Roberts and Frank Lucas who helped with the making of this movie. To think that Lucas made it back to the free world is amazing. To think he lived to see a movie made of his life is even more so.</p></body></html>

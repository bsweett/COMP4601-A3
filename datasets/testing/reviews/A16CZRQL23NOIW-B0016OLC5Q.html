<meta name="summary" content="To face the nature far beyond certain limits, may result fatal!"></head><body><p>Into the wild is the final outcome, an undeserved consequence of an abnormal state of things - around the not so common disagreements of a couple - produced in the core of the sensitive soul, that decided to seek refugee in the books of Jack London, Tolstoi and Thoreau to build his own reason to live. (You mat realize a certain resemblance respect Truffaut's 400 blows)<br /><br />This long expected project nestled over the years and finally materialized once he made the grade. He - like a modern Robinson Crusoe - will make his personal and circular process of growing up ( four well defined stages; childhood, adolescence, manhood and wisdom) through miles and miles of untamed territory, arresting landscapes to crown his most beloved dream: Alaska. Based on true events, this film slow and progressively involves us around every stage of this urban Odyssey until that tragic finale.<br /><br />Sean Penn undertook this project making use of these infinite landscapes, thinking about the promise of the New World  (Antonin Dvorak) and so many myths of personal bliss that nestle unconsciously in closed rooms of our souls. On the way, he will find vestiges of four previous generations, the hippie couple whose main problem is to have lost a son; an ironic mirror image about Alexander Supertramp wants precisely to avoid and even remember; the last encounter with Franz (superbly performed by Hal Hallbrook) was if I may the supreme moment of this poignant movie.<br /><br />One of the best American registers of the last year.</p></body></html>

I was very wrong.  This movie was a big disappointment to me.  Half of the movie was no talking and shooting..boring action at that.  The two stars are for Kate Beckinsale and the few gory parts of the movie that I enjoyed.  The extras are even poor on this DVD.  Nothing there except a few trailers and some other boring stuff.  This movie was so boring that I fell asleep every time I tried watching it all the way through.  I FINALLY managed after the fourth time of trying to watch it.  I would not recommend this.  A rental is about all it's good for.</p></body></html>

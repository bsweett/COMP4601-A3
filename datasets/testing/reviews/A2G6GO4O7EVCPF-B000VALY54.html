While trying to steal something he stumbles into an acting audition where he wins them over and winds up at a big party where he finds the girl he loved way back when in School Harmony played by the delicious Michelle Monaghan (Mission: Impossible 3, North Country). Lockhart winds up in a situation involving a dead girl with private detective Gay Perry played by the rock solid Val Kilmer (The Doors, Spartan). Lockhart takes interest in Harmony when he finds out that her sister was murdered and she asks him to help her so he does that. Kilmer and Downey, Jr. give fantastic performances as does the gorgeous Monaghan in this great film which deliver some outrageous hilarious moments and yes I'm talking about the peeing scene which I admit I laughed.  Not for  all tastes but surely a look if you're fans of the actors. Also starring Corbin Bernsen (Carpool Guy, General Hospital), Shannyn Sossamon (The Order, Rules of Attraction), Larry Miller (Carnival of Souls, Best in Show) and Dash Mihok (Dark Blue, The Thine Red Line).

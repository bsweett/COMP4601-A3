This happened with Karyn Kusama's (the extraordinary "Girlfight") "Aeon Flux," a turkey of such proportions as to overwhelm and upturn the largest and sturdiest of Christmas tables.<br />"Aeon Flux" has many things going for it on paper: Kusama, whose "Girlfight" was tough, gritty and aggressive, every thing this film is not; the glorious Charlize Theron, the noted cinematographer, Graeme Revell, Sophie Okenedo, Marton Csonkas and the estimable Frances McDormand. But what has come out of all this talent? Not much: "Aeon Flux" is still born, stilted, lacking anything even approaching style or forward movement. All of the actors, gifted one and all, are given mostly gibberish to spout...they seem lost and consequently so do we.<br />Despite all of this, the film is quite beautiful, looking very much like a 1960's futuristic film like "Fahrenheit 451" both in production and costume design. "F451" was released in 1966; surely the film makers could have come up with some new ideas particularly with all the technical improvements that have occurred in the last 40 years?<br />Many films are so bad that they are good: "Aeon Flux" is not one of these.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When a house is more than a home"></head><body><p>Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), a troubled woman who has lost control of her life, is evicted from her home for failure to pay a small tax.  The home is auctioned and then bought by Colonel Behrani (Ben Kingsley), formerly of the Iranian Air Force, now reduced to doing manual labor on highway crews.  He hopes to resell the house for a big profit and thus help his family maintain some of their honor and pride.  Kathy tries to get the house back with the help of  her new love, Lester (Ron Eldard), and the lives of all involved are destined for tragedy.<br /><br />I was anxious to see this film because I was so impressed with the novel by Andre Dubus, which was highly dramatic and suspenseful and exquisitely sad.  The movie is none of these, however, despite the outstanding performances of Ben Kingsley as the proud and once-powerful Colonel and  Shohreh Aghdashloo, as his long-suffering wife.  The problem is Connelly, Eldard, and the script are just dull and disappointing.  Aside from Kingsley's scenes, the movie is exceedingly average and uninteresting.  Connelly and Eldard lack charisma and also any chemistry with each other.  The novel's dynamic conflict and heart-pounding tension are gone, and one cares little in the end.  Fans of Ben Kingsley will certainly enjoy his bravura performance, but outside of that, I recommend the book.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Hot Fuzz" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"Hot Fuzz" is excellent! From the creators of "Shaun Of The Dead" (2004), comes "Hot Fuzz". The cast led by Simon Pegg (as Nicholas Angel) (who also played Shaun of "Shaun Of The Dead") and Nick Frost (as Danny Butterman) (who also played Ed in "Shaun Of The Dead") is excellent. The directing by Edgar Wright (who also directed "Shaun Of The Dead") is excellent. The story and screenplay by Wright & Pegg (both who also wrote "Shaun Of The Dead") is excellent. The music by David Arnold (who also did the music to "Casino Royale" (2006) is excellent. The cinematography by Jess Hall is excellent. The film editing by Chris Dickens (who also film edited "Shaun Of The Dead") is excellent. The casting by Nina Gold (who also did the casting to "The Illusionist" (2006) is excellent. The production design by Marcus Rowland (who also did the production design to "Shaun Of The Dead") is excellent. The set decoration by Liz Griffiths (who also did the set decoration to "Shaun Of The Dead") is excellent. The costume design by Annie Hardinge (who also did the costume design to "Shaun Of The Dead") is excellent. This is an excellent action-comedy spoof that does an excellent job of spoofing the movies that it references. Another hit from the creators of "Shaun Of The Dead".</p></body></html>

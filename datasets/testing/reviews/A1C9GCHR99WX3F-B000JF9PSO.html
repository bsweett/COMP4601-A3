<meta name="summary" content="The Story of United 93"></head><body><p>United 93 had to be the most talked about movie in the year 2006, or at least one of them. And lots of questions about this movie, and whether or not that it is too soon after Septemeber 11, 2001 for a film to be made of that horrible day in September of 01. I don't think so, and plus we have had a couple of other ones before this. Just months after the day, we had G&eacute;d&eacute;on and Jules Naudet's 9/11, and Fahrenheit 9/11. And this movie got a R rating from the MPAA, and with very good reason to, so parents please don't let your kids watch this movie until they are old enough, this movie is not for them, and a lot in ths movie they should see, and don't count on a 9/11 film coming out that would even be appioate for them coming out in the future. Since this movie was released in September, tonight I finnaly got the chance to see it on dvd. This movie follows the story of United 93, that was the only hijacked airplanes on the morning of September 11, 2001 that didn't reach its target. Instead United Airlines 93 crashed into a Pennsylvania field. All the actors are unknown, and I would doubt a lot of htem you would have heard of. When this movie came out, and when I saw the full cast list, one of the names that I was surpised to see in the movie, and didn't see mentioned at all in reviews, is Cheyenne Jackson that played Mark Bingham. I know him best for being in the orginal Broadway cast of the Elvis Presley musical All Shook Up that opened up on Broadway on March 24, 2005, but because of decling tickets sales, lead the play to be closed on September 25, 2005. All the people that was on United 93 on that fateful September day died, and just by watching this film makes me glad that I wasn't on one of the 4 planes that day, otherwise I wouldn't be here writing this review. My life would have been lost, and who knows on the 3 other planes, how many people surived that day. And plus I can't even remember the last time I even had to take a plane ride. But still I have to give this a good review, and a recommendation, that if you haven't seen this film yet, that you might want to see this film, whether or not you knew a person that died on September 11th, certainly I have to be sad for the familes of September 11 victims, they didn't dereve to die this way, nor did thier loved ones derseved to lose them this way. I aslo like to reccomend 9/11 (2002), but I haven't seen Fahrenheit 9/11, so I can't tell you if it is even worth a watch.</p></body></html>

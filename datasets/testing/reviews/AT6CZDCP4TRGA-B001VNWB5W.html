<meta name="summary" content="Nicely dark and dirty FUN, FUN, FUN"></head><body><p>[...]<br /><br />Wanted to see this movie mainly because I like the director, Zack Snyder, who did "300"---which was just a really fun, hyper-testosteroned but well-crafted action flick. S<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- nice dark subtext, anti-heroic superheroes, zero pretense of moral piety<br />- nice soundtrack, esp. the opening 5 minutes set to Dylan's "The Times They Are A-Changin'"<br />- excellent pacing, atmospherics, special FX ... visually gorgeous, most of it.<br />- lotsa juicy bone-crunching, blood-splattering, limb-dismembering fight scenes<br />- Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach, what an amazing stand-out performance!<br /><br />What wasn't so great:<br /><br />- Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter. Cute, sort of, but not that great. So-so actress.<br />- the sex scene between Ackerman and Patrick Wilson where they get the big O in the hovercraft which then spurts a big jet of flame. Cheesy-ometer about went through the roof.<br />- the ending: not that I *demand* happy endings, but this one just felt a little redundant after having watched "The Dark Knight."<br />- conservative bias --- there's a fair bit of liberal-bashing but no equal time for conservative bashing, despite the film's setting: a totally corporatist American dictatorship run by one Tricky Dick Nixon, big-time Republican scumbag.<br />- a number of dead spots in the script when things get a bit too corny and/or the cast is being asked to deliver far more than it can deliver<br /><br />Yeah, I'd probably see this film again. Would I want to own it? Probably not.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

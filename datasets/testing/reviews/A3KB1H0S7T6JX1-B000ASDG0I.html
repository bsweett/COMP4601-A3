<meta name="summary" content="True Lies x2"></head><body><p>Mr. & Mrs. Smith brings to the screen the story of a couple who after having spent 5 or 6 years (depending on who you ask) as husband and wife, they realize that they are not who they seem to be...<br /><br />The film does bring to mind True Lies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis; it combines romance, action and adventure making it highly enjoyable.<br /><br />Needless to say, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING!), but it's Vince Vaughn that really steals the show for me!<br /><br />The only major setbacks are in relation to:<br /><br />1) Why is the wife's bureau made up exclusively of women?<br /><br />2) The poor choice of an actor to play "the Tank," who is not all man, if you catch my drift... Any particular reason for that?<br /><br />Aside from that, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />Overall, even though Mr. & Mrs. Smith lacks that extra something to put it over the top, it is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

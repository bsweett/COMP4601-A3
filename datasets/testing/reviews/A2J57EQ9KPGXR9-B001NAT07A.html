<meta name="summary" content="Fanboys: Remember Ertha Kitt??"></head><body><p>This movie is not great, but it is not awful either. I've seen films that are MUCH worse. You see, Catwoman used to be just another colorful Batman villian, a simple jewel thief with a costume, until writers at DC decided to make her a romantic interest (bye-bye Ertha Kitt, hello blonde bombshell Michelle Pfieffer)  which spawned the "Birds of Prey" comic and TV show.<br /><br />Now Halle Berry and director Pitof (I guess Dieter was busy) take a crack at putting Catwoman on the silver screen, delving into the whole quasi pro-feminist, Egyptian mythology based history behind this shallow comic character. I give them points for trying. The main villain is played by Sharon Stone, an evil cosmetics magnate who plans to sell bad makeup to the masses. It confirms my opinion: Sharon Stone cannot act but marries well.<br /><br />Yes, Halle Berry is grade-A hoochie material enhanced by the leather Catwoman costume (personally, she looks hotter in her Ororo X-Man costume) but SHE can act, which helps this film. Department store dummy Benjamin Pratt shows up as the love interest - YAWN...<br /><br />The fight scenes are OK, boarderline bad but I have seen worse (the last Batman film for example). Catwoman is worth a look, but buying it would'nt be a great idea.</p></body></html>

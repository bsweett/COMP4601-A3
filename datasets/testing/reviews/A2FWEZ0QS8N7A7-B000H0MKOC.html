<meta name="summary" content="The Joke's on Who?"></head><body><p>Big tobacco is of course an old, broad and very deserving target, but the real bullseyes of the satire in Thank You For Smoking are the people in those institutions -- mainly Washington pols, Hollywood and the media -- that assert with a straight face that they are serving the public interest instead of, as Nick Naylor (an excellent Aaron Eckhardt) is happy to admit, paying the mortgage.  Watching that skewering -- which is aided and abetted by the fine performances of Rob Lowe, William H. Macy, and Katie Holmes -- provides most of the fun in Thank You.  It's also amusing that the only remotely human and appealing characters in the movie, aside from Nick and his son, are Nick's fellow Merchants of Death and Robert Duvall as the tobacco company mogul.  The movie goes badly wrong just once, when Nick is kidnapped by anti-smoking vigilantes who almost kill him by covering his body with nicotine patches and make him momentarily an object of sympathy.  Otherwise, Thank You For Smoking is quick on its feet, bright, and often very funny.</p></body></html>

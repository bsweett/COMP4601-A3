<meta name="summary" content="Here's Johnny"></head><body><p>Based on the Stephen King novel, Jack Nicholson stars as Jack Torrence with Shelly Duvall as his wife. How a family collapses when a father can't perform his duty as provider and protector. And then of course there's the redrum- murder spelled backwards- with the kid. A family moves into a remote hotel only to awaken the ghosts of residences past, causing Jack Torrence to lose his mind. This time around when I saw it, it didn't scare me, it's just crazy acting with Nicholson in a blue chipper performce. Compared to scary me witless in 9th grade in just the opening few minutes. A true gem of a horror film, even if it isn't scary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Running Toward Happiness: The American Dream Revisited"></head><body><p>PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a film that despite all its flaws (repetition of chases, repeated encounters that mirror the last, emotional overload, excessive playing time of two hours, etc) reinforces some truly important human values: love between a father and son, pushing forward toward success despite all the roadblocks, kindness for the plight of the homeless, and strength of character in the face of hopelessness.  Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.<br /><br />Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt.  Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film.  Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco.  Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.<br /><br />With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry.  The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed.  How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.<br /><br />Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines.  Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy.  The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent.  PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is well worth the journey.  Grady Harp, March 07</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MAYBE WES SHOULD STICK TO HORROR FILMS?"></head><body><p>The first half of RED EYE is fairly suspensful and absorbing mostly due to the excellent evil-doer acting of Cillian Murphy, who "kidnaps" our heroine, played by Rachel McAdams, on a red eye flight in order to assassinate a Home Security bigwig. Thriller movies like this rise or fall depending on the quality of the actor playing the villian (and the script backing him or her up). Reference is made to DIE HARD as an example where a strong and interesting villain character made the film. And for the first part of RED EYE we have a suave, clever, smooth, manipulative, dangerous bad guy in Mr. Murphy. Then, suddenly, all that falls apart. Murphy's character becomes a pathetic victim of the super woman heroine. But we won't give away any more plot information. The point is, it went from scary believeable to laugh-out-loud unbelieveable. Wes Cravens, the horror film vet, directed this non-horror effort. Perhaps he should stick to the horror genre in future.</p></body></html>

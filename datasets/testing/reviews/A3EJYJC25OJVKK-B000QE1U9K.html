<meta name="summary" content="Magnificent DVD set! Trash the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot;!"></head><body><p>This collection of all four of the Alien movie series really does an excellent job of really compiling a very uneven movie franchise and packing it up onto one amazing, if imperfect, set with each of the individual movies having their original versions as well as ?Special Editions? of each one, with a ninth disc, and the result is a downright awesome DVD set.<br /><br />ALIEN (1979): This Ridley Scott directed classic broke so much new ground when it was released. A team of deep space pioneers are returning home from earth when a mysterious signal on a desolate planet is received by the crew aboard the ship Nostromos. When they are sent in to investigate where this mysterious signal came from, they have no idea of the horrors that they will find themselves up against. This one is incredibly groundbreaking and is very suspenseful. The special effects are extremely dated though but this is still a powerful sci-fi classic.<br /><br />ALIENS (1986): This one is easily the best one in my catalog. I can easily remember how much this movie scared me to death when it was released when I was only a toddler. In this one, Ripley is in cryogenic suspension for over 57 years and when she is awaked after all of that time, she is told that the planet that she escaped from after killing the alien there has been colonized. However, as the colony began to flourish, contact is suddenly lost?.completely?..and now a team of Space Marines is sent in with Ripley being the ?advisor? to the team and to rescue any possible survivors, but then realize that Ripley?s main enemy species has made it?s nest there and now they must destroy the nest and the aliens there and escape?if they can. This is easily my favorite of the bunch because of so many things. The acting is almost perfect by everyone. James Cameron?s directing is his best he?s ever done and the special effects even by 1980s standards are absolutely amazing and hardly even show their age.<br /><br />ALIEN 3 (1992): This one to me is one of the most unfairly criticized and underrated classics of all time. At the same time though, I sometimes felt troubled at some of the things that happened in this film in the beginning. Ripley finds herself on a planet after an alien in fact laid an egg onboard the spachship that she, Hicks and Newt were on and where the Queen Alien was defeated. An acid spill causes an electrical fire which causes the escape pod to detach and Ripley is the only survivor once again after the pod crashes into the ocean of a desolate planet where dangerous prisoners are held in a high-security facility called Fury 161. The prisoners however along with Ripley are being hunted by a much deadlier breed Alien like no other and they have No weapons to fight the creature. Ripley herself finds out that her biggest nightmare has come true and that the alien isn?t her only enemy anymore. I?ve always had mixed feelings towards this movie. The most troubling were that two of my favorite characters from the previous one are killed off and it was really depressing. The biggest problem I had with this was that it used the F-Bomb too much. A few such bombs are fine from time to time but sheesh, cut down on them please! Otherwise, this movie is nonetheless a strong entry. The extended cut of this is light years better and replaces some footage from the original version and replaces it while adding previously unreleased footage and extending the movie by over 30 minutes. The result is a much improved version that while deeply flawed no matter what, makes it a lot better than before.<br /><br />ALIEN RESURRECTION (1997): Easily my least favorite of the bunch, I nonetheless find it enjoyable to some extent due to it?s awesome special effects and action sequences. 200 years after Ripley?s passing, scientists from the company that wanted to quarantine the creature have managed to acquire both it and Ripley?s DNA and cloned both of them. The Alien species that her ?ancestor? had fought hard to destroy forever is now heading towards humanity?s home planet Earth and if the Alien makes it there, it could spell catastrophe for humanity. I?ve always had mixed opinions about this movie back when it was released and still do to this day. I?ve always felt that this was more like some kind of spinoff of some sort rather than the continuation of the Alien Saga but it interesting to take into account cloning her even if the samples have survived for over 200 years exposed to the elements. The acting except by Weaver herself of course was hammy and really dogged this movie. Easily the weakest but nonetheless enjoyable but only for Alien die-hards. For everyone else, the first three are more than satisfactory</p></body></html>

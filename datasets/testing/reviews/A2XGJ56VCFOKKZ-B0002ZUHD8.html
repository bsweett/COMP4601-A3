<meta name="summary" content="Hugely disappointing"></head><body><p>I missed this film when it came to theaters, because it disappeared so quickly.  This was one of the summer releases in 2004 that I was most looking forward to see, because there hasn't been a major film that I'm aware of that covers the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Roundtable.  When it was released on DVD, I took a gamble in buying it, since I'd never seen it previously.  I thought no one could mess up a film like this, but I was wrong.  This is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced watching a film, and its not like I had huge expectations before I watched it.  I was looking forward to seeing a big screen treatment of King Arthur that was equal to if not better than the film version of "Robin Hood" (the Kevin Costner film that unfortunately doesn't hold up well with the passage of time).  Like another film reviewer said, this one is not "Gladiator" or even "Troy".  I would even say that this isn't even "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" or "A Knight's Tale".<br /><br />The main problem I have with this film is probably all of the battle scenes.  The filmmakers probably didn't count on the audience fatigue of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, in which the battle scenes were exceptionally well done in all three films.  After that trilogy, epic films centered on battle scenes aren't going to captivate audiences, so that's probably the biggest flaw this film made.  Had they focused more on the interpersonal drama and storytelling through dialogue and human interactions, it would have made a much better film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film lacks warmth of any kind.  The scenes are dark and dreary, which is perfect for mood setting, but a whole film like that?  There is little sense of humor or funny dialogue that lightens the film, instead we get a treatment of Arthur that is entirely too serious.  It moves along slowly, and the entire plot rests on three key battle scenes...one in the opening, one in the middle and the big finale.  I would have preferred to see more of the intellect of King Arthur, how he related to people and why he became a legend...something beyond his display of courage and strength on the battlefields.  There's more to King Arthur than violence and killing of enemies, but we just don't see it.<br /><br />The reason I give it two stars is because I like Clive Owen and the flaws of this film are in no way attributed to him.  He is a perfect King Arthur, in an imperfect movie.  The second star goes to one of the best scenes I have ever seen in any movie.  The middle battle scene that takes place on a frozen lake is clever, original, and exceptionally well done.  Its the only thing worth seeing in this film, unfortunately, but it is something to watch with marvel.  Too bad they didn't spend more time making the rest of the film worth watching.  I guess someone should send a memo to Hollywood:  epic films with little more than battle scenes are box office bombs.  If you don't believe me...look at the disappointing returns of "King Arthur" and "Alexander".  "Troy" is marginally better because the story worked.  However, after the brillant success of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, I'd say that people are just battle-worn-out.  Let the genre rest a few years.  When you've seen one battle scene, you pretty much seen them all, and there's no reason why any movie should base its whole plot on three key battle scenes.  That tells you right there there isn't a story worth telling, so they should go back to the drawing board until they get a story that's worth telling that doesn't rely so much on battles as it does on the wits and conversations that carry better films.</p></body></html>

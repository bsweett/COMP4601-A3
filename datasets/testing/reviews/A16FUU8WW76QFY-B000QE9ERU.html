What more could one ask for?<br /><br />Thomas Jane plays the title role, who is out to get the stereotypical sneering bad guy (John Travolta seems to be making a career of playing this type) who murdered his wife and son. Along the way people get shot, stabbed, blown to bits, burned... well I think you've got the idea.<br /><br />Since this film is more or less a fantasy (Marvel Comic based), the makers can get away with all kinds of trangressions: no cops are seen anywhere in the movie, in spite of all kinds of mayhem.  Bad guys are simply erased from existence, with a witty one liner to send them off (ala Schwarzenegger).<br /><br />The film is fun to watch overall.  There is a bit of slow period in the middle of the film, but this is forgotten in the extremes of the big finale ending.  Rebecca Romijn makes a more or less token appearance for eyecandy purposes.  Travolta is almost corny as the evil money launderer who gets it in the end.  All in all not a bad way to spend two hours.<br /><br />Note: Not for small children!  Extreme violence and bloodletting.</p></body></html>

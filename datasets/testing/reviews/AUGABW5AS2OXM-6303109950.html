<meta name="summary" content="An Outstanding Movie!"></head><body><p>This was one of the best western movies I have ever seen. This movie had above all outstanding actors. Kurt Russell.Sam Elliott, and Powers Boothe were very good in theor roles. The real show stealer in this movie was Val Kilmer playing in the role of the legendary Doc Holliday. This movies details Wyatt Earp's attempt to retire. It falls short when some bad guys hit the scene. Earp along with his gang take action to stop the forces of evil.The showdown between Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday is exceptional. Of course the big confrontation happens at the O.K. Corral. This is without question an outstanding movie. See it, you will not be dissapointed. Like it has already been said,a cult classic.</p></body></html>

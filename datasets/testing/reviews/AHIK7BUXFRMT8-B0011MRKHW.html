<meta name="summary" content="Exciting Action Movie from History"></head><body><p>While I am not a history buff and do not seek out history books to read as recreation I found this movie to be interesting and as a result started doing some research on the history of that era. The movie as stand-alone entertainment is far superior to the first movie in this series, Elizabeth. The pace of the movie never lagged and the scenery was splendid as it portrayed England during a turbulent period of its history.<br /><br />As I expected, Cate Blanchett did a marvelous job portraying the queen as did the other actors in their roles. The visual effects of the battle with the Spanish Armada were very well done and the scene of Elizabeth encouraging her troops before the battle almost brought tears to my eyes. The audio and video quality is both excellent.<br /><br />There are a number of special features which include one rather grotesque shot of a decapitated head. One problem we encountered involved understanding all the words; it seemed as if the music got louder as the actors started whispering making it very difficult to catch all they were saying. We solved that problem be activating English subtitles; after that we didn't miss a word.<br /><br />The movie provides an exciting evening's entertainment and I recommend it highly.</p></body></html>

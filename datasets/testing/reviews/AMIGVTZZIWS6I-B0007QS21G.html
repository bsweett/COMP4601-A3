<meta name="summary" content="Suspensful Movie With a Message"></head><body><p>The producers kind of hit you over the head with this movie's message:  global warming is bad, man!  Be that as it may, this movie is exciting from minute one and doesn't stop until the very end.  The science seems sound, the plot is great, and the actors are top-notch.  One of the best films in which Dennis Quaid starred in very long time.  The movie is, of course, effects-driven, but that doesn't take away from the film.  Just watching that huge tidal wave hit New York was damn spectacular! On a poltical note, it was kinda funny to se the vice-president character made to look and sounds so much like our current VP:  potty-mouth Cheney.  Overall, this film is summer movie escapism with a message tucked in underneath. Very enjoyable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating and suspenseful."></head><body><p>Inside Man is a fascinating, suspenseful bank heist / hostage story. The robbers cleverly dress their hostages all in the same kind of diguises they're wearing, so the cops can't tell bad guys from victims.  But the fact they're taking time to implement such an elaborate scheme - rather than taking the money and escaping - seems to indicate they're after some particular thing other than the money.<br /><br />Denzel Washington and Willem Dafoe play cops handling the situation, Christopher Plummer is the bank president, who hires Jodie Foster, some sort of private eye, to try to prevent the robbers from getting some particular thing in the bank, other than the money.<br /><br />It's fascinating and suspenseful, well written and well-acted, and the only problem I had with the whole film was that they didn't explain, at the end, how the bank robbers knew in the first place about some particular thing they were after, other than the money. They do leave room for you to figure that out yourself, though.</p></body></html>

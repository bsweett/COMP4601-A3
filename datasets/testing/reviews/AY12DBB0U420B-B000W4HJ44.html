<meta name="summary" content="A Frivolous And Fun Movie. John Travolta Was Huge."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack DVD was "Hairspray." I found it at a Ross Store. Hairspray is a musical and I just don't watch many musicals. Okay, there was "Mama Mia" and I admit to enjoying it. Well, I'll admit to enjoying "Hairspray" too. It was a fun movie. Not much depth. So-so acting. Light on the story, but somehow everything seemed to hold  together and it was an enjoyable movie to watch. The actors seemed to be having fun too. It was probably the biggest role of John Travolta's career.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? It was a musical set in Baltimore at about the time that the integration movement was sweeping over the country. Old attitudes and new attitudes were thoroughly mixed and, of course, conflicts of ideas abounded. I'd say it was one of those looking-back things that was almost embarrassing to view. The movie had a sort of frivolous fun feeling and everybody gave the appearance of having a good time. Light, chuckling laughs were abundant. Seeing John Travolta cast as an overweight mother was worth the price of the disc. Where did they ever find a fat suit that large? Of course, it also looked as if he was wearing his own personal fat suit, in addition. Well, it was sing and dance, sing and dance, all with a comical light story to hold things together. It was a pleasant and enjoyable movie, but short of first rate.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

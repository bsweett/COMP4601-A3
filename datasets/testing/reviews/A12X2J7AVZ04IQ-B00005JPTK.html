Mediocre reviews still couldn't keep me from seeing the very reliable Will Smith in a genre that I love. I got the 2-disc "Special Edition" at a good price. There aren't a whole lot of extras for a 2-disc version, but the 2nd disc is the Unrated Theatrical Edition. Mr. Smith is good, and the premise is certainly intriguing, though not terribly original. I was more entertained by "Night of the Comet". Still, magnificent special effects and sound effects, and steady direction by Francis Lawrence, made this enjoyable for me. I like sci-fi, and  enjoy a good "light-show" on occasion. Smith's character is most empathetic, and the brief appearance of Alice Braga is sweet in the midst of chaos.  I didn't look for flaws; rather, enjoyed a fun (?) film made with flair and care.</p></body></html>

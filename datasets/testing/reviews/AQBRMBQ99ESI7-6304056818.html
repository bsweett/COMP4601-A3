Throw in Anne Francis and there can no longer be any doubt: FORBIDDEN PLANET is THE icon.<br /><br />Its not too bad a movie for its time. A ship from earth is dispatched to check in on a colony that has been silent for far too long. Upon arrival, the crew of the ship learn that there is only one survivor of the original party, a Dr. Morbius. To keep him company, he has his daughter and a robot he built. To occupy his time, he studies the vanished civilization that one lived on the planet and builds miraculous devices such as the robot.<br /><br />Needless to say, the crew is a bit perturbed by Morbius's account of the deaths of the rest of his party. They were all violently killed by a strange beast who has not appeared in 20 years. The beast does re-appear, though, and starts to pick off members of the ship's crew. There is very limited time to figure out what is going on before all are dead. The secret lies within themselves.<br /><br />As with most such productions of this age, the science is laughable. The story is fun, though, and Anne sure was pretty!</p></body></html>

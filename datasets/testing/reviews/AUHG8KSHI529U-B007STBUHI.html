<meta name="summary" content="A superior film - good to remember how well done it was"></head><body><p>I remember when I first saw Jaws and what an exciting experience it was.  The now all familiar pounding theme music, the head popping out of the hole in the boat, the shark cage attack, the spectacular demise of the shark, and always Quint!  What had dimmed after all these years was the wonderful first half of the movie on Amity Island.  Seeing the family sequences again, and the struggle that the Islanders had in coming to terms with the reality of this predatory shark and what it meant to their financial survival is really quite touching and painful.<br /><br />In the fine feature on the making of Jaws on the disk, Spielberg discusses how not showing the shark adds to the drama, but he also admits that the barrels had to substitute for the shark because the mechanical shark wasn?t working very well.  Frankly, I am glad it didn?t.  We see the shark just enough.  Implying the shark is supremely effective.<br /><br />While the main three characters, Brody (Scheider), Quint (Shaw), and Hooper (Dreyfuss), are so brilliantly played they have become immortal roles, there are many other fine performances that are overshadowed.  Lorraine Gary adds a wonderful reality to Brody family trying to fit in as newcomers to Amity Island trying to fit in.  I am glad they changed the character from the book.  Murray Hamilton as the small town mayor Larry Vaughn who is simply trying to keep the Island?s economy afloat and doesn?t grasp what is really happening until disaster has finally struck full force.<br /><br />The character roles of the fishermen and would-be fishermen are wonderful splashes of color on the film canvas and add humor to relieve tension and set up the second half confrontation so well.<br /><br />This is a superior film that has been imitated so often that we forget how good the original actually is.  This is a good disk with a good copy of the film and extras that help us appreciate how the film came to be.</p></body></html>

While he searches for a cure to his condition, General Ross (William Hurt) has discovered where he is and tracks him down so he and his soldiers can take them alive to conduct experiments. As Banner returns back to the states, he is reunited with the love of his life Betty (Liv Tyler) and accidently releases his rage to become the Hulk on some soldiers with Betty as the only thing that can calm the creature down. KBG agent Emil Bronsky (Tim Roth) conducts an experiment on himself with the same gamma that made Banner the Hulk when he's angry as it later transforms him into a hideous monster called The Abomination who's powers matches the Hulk's as the green goliath is the only one that can stop it.<br /><br />Exciting and action-packed reboot of the 2003 Ang Lee film which wasn't too bad but left a bad taste to most people's mouths. Director Louis Leterrier and star Edward Norton has made a stand-alone movie that remains more true to the roots of both the comic books and the classic 70's TV show with Bill Bixby. The special effects are a vast improvement over the last one with the Hulk being more convincing and less cartoonish this time, the action is non-stop and the performances are just terrific including Norton as the tortured soul Bruce Banner. There's special appearences by Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee and Robert Downy Jr as Tony Stark which leads up to a big Marvel event movie coming in 2011.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the best quality picture and sound that is mindblowing like the film itself! the extras are outstanding like the U-Control mode where you can watch extras during the movie or after the movie. There's a BD-Chat where you can hook the internet to your Blu-Ray player to make your own commentary with other people on-line plus some great extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, alternate opening, Comic Book gallery, character files, picture in picture access where you can see interviews and behind the scenes footage during the movie, animated comic, four featurettes and digital copy with the Blu-Ray box-cover in limited edition 3-D.<br /><br />Nice to see Marvel getting back on track on film with this and "Iron Man" being examples.</p></body></html>

For primo examples of this genre, think "Network" or "Wag the Dog," to which "Thank You" seems mild in comparison though there are several real positives about this film: for one the Nick Naylor of Aaron Eckhardt. As a spin-doctor for the Tobacco Industry, it is Nick's job to promote cigarette smoking in a world in which everyone mostly is against it...except of course, for those of us who smoke.<br /><br />Eckhart's Nick is quick talking, handsome: a man who can think on his feet. But director Jason Reitman has chosen to humanize Nick by making him a dedicated and concerned father which makes Nick a warm, caring human being, yes but it also saps his strength as basically an  s.o.b. There are no real heroes in Satire.<br /><br />With that said, some of the best scenes in "Thank You" are those between Nick and his son, Joey (Cameron Bright) and those between Nick and the M.O.D. (Masters of Destruction...Polly (Maria Bello) and Bobby Jay (David Koechner) as fellow spin doctors for the Alcohol and Firearms industries.<br /><br />Unfortunately what "Thank You for Smoking" lacks is the steel backbone necessary to make it a complete success as Satire though it nonetheless offers some genuinely funny and intelligent moments.</p></body></html>

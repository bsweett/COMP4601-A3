<meta name="summary" content="Two great stories + a kooky twist."></head><body><p>Captivating start in a Tsunami scene in South East Asia that ended up in a life changing trauma. Had that story unfolded throughout the movie, it might have made a great film. Here, the French media icon suddenly lost her most precious gift of staying focused after concussion in a drowning accident. Surrounded by wolves and cold blooded business folks, she was given no chance to regain herself. Her sexuality and outlook got her to the top, but her brief and tragic suffering caused her to be dumped by her very abusers. One of those suggested that the English folks would be more perceptive to the delusion of after death, and he would soon be proven correct.<br /><br />The second story that would converge on the other two, took place in San Francisco. As the French businessman conjectured,the America Psychic who was a schizophrenic patient would miraculously climb the wall, from a forklift driver, to a fan of Charles Dickens, to the future lover of the French icon. That one was a truly kooky fabrication and inexplicable twist. The medicated schizophrenic was able to connect with the dead in such reliable and verifiable manner that made the movie discomforting.<br /><br />The second best story, or the first best, was the British twin boys who struggled with an impoverished and alcoholic, but loving single mom. The acting and emotions of the kids and their associates were remarkable.<br /><br />Returning to the French media icon, it sounded too simplistic for a well educated professional to ask the dumbest questions about a vision she had. As if such media icon who was able to face the whole world with critique and analysis, could not figure out her state of traumatized mind after the trauma of approaching death.  Ending up with an American schizophrenic lover was an outstretch of imagination.</p></body></html>

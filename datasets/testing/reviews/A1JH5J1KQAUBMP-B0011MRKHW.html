<meta name="summary" content="An inferior sequel"></head><body><p>Conflict between Protestants and Catholics flares as Philip II (Jordi Molla) of Spain plots the assassination of Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) and the invasion of England.  Meanwhile, on the home front, a romantic triangle heats up between Elizabeth, her favorite handmaiden Bess (Abbie Cornish), and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen).<br /><br />No doubt the first Elizabeth film took its share of liberties with historical fact, but at least it was a serious examination of how a powerful and resourceful woman came to power, maintained her position, and the price she paid for it.  This sequel is a combination of soap opera and Errol Flynn-type swashbuckler, peopled by one-dimensional characters.</p></body></html>

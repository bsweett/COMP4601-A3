<meta name="summary" content="Best Actor Oscar Robin Williams/Best Screenplay Mark Romanek"></head><body><p>One Hour Photo is a high caliber psychological drama starring Robin Williams in his best performance to date. Here Robin's latest non-comedic role is that of Sy the Photo Guy, a friendless, familyless worker at a One Hour Photo shop whose abused childhood is about to catch up with him. He insinuates himself into the Yorkin family whom he developes film for, going so far as to read a Deepak Chopra book because he glimpses it in Nina Yorkin's (Connie Nielsen's) bag. The book quote he gives her gives a strong clue to the film's true theme, "What we fear most already happened".  Sy sees the Yorkins as the ideal family that he never had, making extra sets of their photos to put on his wall.<p>Throughout we get an ominous humming background soundtrack a la Safe as well as a violin motif borrowed from Requiem for a Dream (borrowed from Laurie Anderson). This film has been compared to Taxi Driver, but more appropriate comparison would be Midnight Cowboy.  The parallel to Joe Buck's isolation and naivetee, his disconnection with the TV and radio shows he watches/listens to for example is strikingly similar.  And both films are a subjective jump into the character's isolation, demons, and emotions.<p> Sy's lid on those demons is blown when he sees photo evidence of Will Yorkin's (Michael Vartan's) infidelity...and gets fired by a fascist boss (Gary Cole). Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle) serves as liaison between Sy and the audience, as he tries to grasp what we try to. One significant hint is when he says, "Well he knew that Yoshi (Paul Kim) would come to you and you would call us", i.e. Sy set up this elaborate plan to get caught (to get attention).  And finally in cathartic release acts out his own abuse, his abusive father taking him over. Then the regression to the ideal childhood, hence the photos of objects a la Jake's photos. Importantly we don't know all this until the end, when he explains it to the detective...in a manner that can easily go over the heads of a mainstream audience.  What sums up Sy's tortured world best is the shock registered on the expression of Maya (Erin Daniels).<p> Keep your eyes peeled for any Academy politics that would prevent deserved Oscars for Robin Williams and Mark Romanek.</p></body></html>

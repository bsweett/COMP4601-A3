It starts with a nice premise - the lonely crusty old guy who will go on his last great adventure (OK lifting his house with toy balloons) who makes friends with a needy kid - but then it lost me completely with this strange subplot of adventure with this bad guy in S America wants to do bad things with the help of talking dogs.  It starts sentimental, then becomes an action film.  Just didn't click for me, though my son liked it well enough.</p></body></html>

A great little spy thriller, with lots of action and an interesting story.  And the car chase was amazing!  I never got around to reading the book, so maybe I will check that out.  It seems like Matt Damon might have been a little too young to play this part, and I would have expected someone a little older, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.  I would have enjoyed just a little more story in there...things seemed a little too laid out in front of me at times, like they were feeding the story to me, but whatever.  Basically, this is the story of a spy who was thought to have been killed during a mission, but turns up sans his memory.  The agency he worked for, who thought he was dead, seems to have a special interest in not allowing him to live.  He has no memories about his past, but he has these survival skills and abilities that he finds he must use to stay alive.  He slowly starts putting the pieces back together, and discovers his true identity.  All in all, a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  I didn't really care much for the ending, but it didn't spoil the movie.  If you want a tight, fast movie with lots of action and a good story to boot, then get this movie.</p></body></html>

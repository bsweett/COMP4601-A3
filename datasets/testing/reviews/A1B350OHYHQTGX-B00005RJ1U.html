<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant"></head><body><p>Personally I love HORROR movies and I was surprised that I didn't hear about this movie earlier although it was extremely scary! You just can't take a breath for full 1.5 hours. To me the best part was the first half an hour. It was well made. The car scenes, truck scene and the pipe adventure was SUPERB.<p>The weak points I found were:<br />1.  It is a monster movie which I find difficult to swallow, I prefer serial killers characters!<br />2. There were few mistakes that the director overlooked such as:<br />a) Trish (Gina Philips) being able to run after the monster kidnapped her brother at the end of the movie although the Police station doors were electrically locked.<br />b) The policemen not shooting the monster's wings (before he flys with Trish) at the end of the movie although they had more than enough time to do so.<br />c) The dead bodies in the Church basement were so obviously fake.<br />d) Darry (Justin Long) body & face at the end of the movie was so obviously fake.<br />3. In the DVD bonuses (the making of the movie) I didn't like the comments & big ego of the director (Victor Salva). I found his claim that he can do better than the movies "The Sixth Sense" & "Blair Witch Project", very much offending.<p>But in the end, this movie was successful enough to scare me! And I'll look forward for part 2.</p></body></html>

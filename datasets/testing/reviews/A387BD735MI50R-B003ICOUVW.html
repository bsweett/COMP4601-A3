The smoky oak atmosphere of the English village and the surrounding woods is interesting for a while. But then the unrelieved lowering of sky and woods and old mansion begins to get tedious.<br /><br />The actors also have too limited a range to play across here. I'd looked forward to seeing Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins star together. Both men have great faces and generally a great on-screen presence. But their usual charisma gets smothered in the dour monochrome settings of "Wolfman." It's as if one of the dusty brocade tapestries on the walls of the Talbot mansion had fallen on them, pressing them into the misty purple scenes.<br /><br />I had thought that modern F/X techniques might have made man's transformation into wolf even more thrilling than it was in the Lon Chaney Jr. original of this movie. But it isn't so. If anything, the modern simulations make the transformation look almost ludicrous in comparison to the more nuanced elision from man to beast that the Chaney version accomplished. The wolf versions of the man look more like artifacts than ever.<br /><br />There are a few moments of genuine emotion here as the Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt characters discover their love for each other. But this humanity gets covered by the matted fur coat of Larry Talbot's alter ego. On the whole, I'd advise that you spit up this hairball.</p></body></html>

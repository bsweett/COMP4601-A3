<meta name="summary" content="Superman return to us with a mild storm."></head><body><p>I was able to see this film over the holiday weekend. I've noticed a lot of people were hungry for this film to come out and ended up somewhat satisfied with the product.  "Superman Returns" is a competent movie, generally very well produced, directed and cast. But it didn't quite gel for me. I thought it dragged at points, as Superman got bogged down with pining over Lois Lane instead of saving the day. I thought the dialogue just wasn't sharp enough to sustain these heavy-handed emotional scenes; what sort of catchphrase is "I'm always around," anyway?<br /><br />Here's what I did enjoy. The flight scenes were beautiful; Superman cut a very majestic figure as he soared across skylines and stars capes. The set design was great, too, creating a modern feel with hints of the Art Deco style I associate with Superman. And I appreciated the performances of Spacey, Bosworth and Langella. Routh had a curiously small role, especially as Clark Kent, so I had trouble judging whether he was wooden or actually good at playing a modest hero.<br /><br />Here's what I enjoyed less. Luthor's plan simply didn't interest me. I found the whole notion of growing a giant crystal island very surreal and not too threatening. Also, he poses a fairly boring threat to Superman. If Luthor's got Kryptonite, Superman is helpless; if he hasn't got Kryptonite, he's helpless. These two legendary antagonists can never really meet on equal terms. Thus, most confrontations between them must inevitably be one-sided.<br /><br />I also had a mixed reaction to the CGI effects. Some were wonderful, and others looked artificial despite being very detailed. I so very much wanted to love this film but sometime Hollywood studios have a way of systematically destroying every decent franchise they get their hands on. In spite of my mix emotions of the movie, it's far from being horrible. It's just not great...like it should have been.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kick-Ass (Blu-ray)"></head><body><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />Yet another film I never got around to watching in theaters, but still a piece of work that I ended up liking a lot, Kick-Ass really caught me by surprise with the mishmash of elements it possessed in both writing and production. Initially, the trailer for this movie had me thinking it would be more along the lines of a satire, which it kind of is, but it's also a representation of the superhero genre as well as a parody in and of itself (think Edgar Wright and his work with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz). While not any one aspect of the film overpowers the other, I think there are enough of them to cater to a multitude of audiences. Kick-Ass is the story of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an average teenager with average problems who likes to read comics, becomes a self-made, wannabe superhero, and within this life, comes to realize its hazards, while also trying to impress a girl at school (Lyndsy Fonseca). He meets two true superheroes in Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and adventure ensues as they try to bring down big-time mobster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). For me personally, I found the main theme to be a coming-of-age story. Dave has a good heart and wants to do good things (and get laid), but ultimately isn't much of a superhero, later realizing he wasn't really cut out for the gig. His character is sympathetic and very relatable, in my opinion, and does a great job propelling the audience into all kinds of other aspects. In addition to Dave's self-discovery, the film also has various instances of dark and raunchy comedy, character drama, vengeance and redemption, and brutal, stylized violence, of which the last is probably the most controversial in the form of 11 year-old Moretz's depiction for her character. However, if anything else, this particular aspect of the film will probably wow most people over because it really is a great performance with enough of a message (if you want to interpret one), while also being escapist entertainment at its best. I just wish the movie were a little longer to flesh out the characters a bit more, but we'll see if they expand upon that in the sequel.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />I swear I thought something was wrong with the transfer upon my initial viewing. Colors seem vibrant enough, but become way overblown at times, while black levels were inconsistent, crushed, and on occasion shades of blue. Contrast was affected as well by those fluctuating blacks and resulted in lost detail and smeared textures. But after watching the extras, I found out it was all intentional. You see, in the comics the ink artist was told that he wasn't to use the color black.. ever. Looking at some of the pictures from the comic, it certainly makes for a much more peculiar type of art style, but what looks good on paper doesn't always necessarily translate well to the film medium. While the grain thing may have worked for Zack Snyder and 300, colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness still had an amazing amount of depth, detail, and delineation through his cinematography. But here, a lot of the uniqueness seems to work more against the picture than for it. The best examples I can use for comparison are the scenes where Big Daddy raids the lumber factory and the one where Hit Girl is trying to save him and Kick-Ass. In the raid scene, you get a really good look at his costume from a variety of angles. You think it'd be a black, Batman-type suit with a black shotgun in his hands, right? Well, neither of them are black, they're "Off-Black." Who's ever heard of the color "Off-Black?" Black is supposed to be black. But then in the rescue scene when the lights are shot out, the pitch black darkness is as black as the abyss of death (or whatever scary, black allusion you can think of). There were actual blacks within the cinematography here, and they were absolutely perfect. It's just a shame the rest of the film wasn't as clean. Kudos to DP, Ben Davis, and the color department for trying preserve the intended look and integrity of the comic, though.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Sure the video is a bit questionable, but the audio has no issues, whatsoever. The DTS-HD 7.1 track is relatively underused in the presence of dialogue, which sounds perfect and un-muddled, by the way. But when action and ambiance occur, it's quite the technical nugget. Directionality consists of a mixed bag and presents itself mainly through the use of music and whatever sound effects are present on-screen. Things like cars, city noise, and crowd chatter do what's expected of them in terms of proper placement and panning, while the more aggressive sounds like hits, cuts, thuds, and gunshots have a tendency to disperse through any one of the other six surround channels when the moment calls for them. Musical accompaniment and songs from a wide variety of artists and the four composers who worked on this film do a splendid job adding pace and mood, particularly the John Williams Superman homage in Kick-Ass' theme and the Zimmer/Howard Joker theme used build tension at one point. Separation of said effects and music are spot-on, never letting the dialogue get lost. A few great reference scenes would be the aforementioned Big Daddy raid and Hit Girl rescue, or even the final scene where Hit Girl invades D'Amico's headquarters, as there's quite a bit of action and gunshot activity throughout each. LFEs aren't too frequent, but really make themselves known in the form of heavier rounds being fired and through the occasional explosion, burning flame, or bass rhythm. Don't be fooled by the majority of a front-heavy presentation at the beginning. Things will unfold as they should.<br /><br />Extras - 5.0<br /><br />Kick-Ass is loaded with special features. I literally spent 6 hours watching every single feature on the disc: the movie, the movie with P-i-P commentary (skipped the audio one since it's excerpted from the Bonus View Mode), and then the 2-hour making-of featurette (actually a little over 2 hours, if you combine it with the "history of the comic" feature). So this Bonus View thing is apparently Lionsgate's answer to Warner Brothers' Maximum Movie Mode. A window for the commentary takes up the screen with director Matthew Vaughn sitting there in a studio watching the movie (which plays on your screen in the bottom corner), while bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage is mixed in with his comments. It's damn informative in a lot of aspects from the pre-production, filming, and post-production phases down to the challenges faced in making the whole thing. Vaughn presents himself well and seems to be really proud of what he accomplished, given a lot of problems that occurred and the fact that they only had a $28 million dollar budget. It's a mix between business-oriented and kick-back commentary on the project and manages to be a very engaging experience. On the other hand, the making-of feature doesn't recycle a thing from the Bonus View Mode and is all fresh material. It essentially covers more of the overall production of the film from beginning to end in great detail and has various interviews, excerpts, and events to really show the viewer how much freakin' work they put into it. Then finally, there's a 20-minute feature talking about the comic, what Mark Millar wanted to do with it, how John Romita Jr. went about drawing it, and all that other stuff. It's truly an exhausting set of extras, but if you ever wanted to know anything about Kick-Ass in either movie or comic form, the Blu-ray is where you need to look.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />This movie was a big surprise for me. Most comic book adaptations to the big screen tend to have fairly linear narratives, an understood formula for storytelling, and plausible protagonists. Kick-Ass is kind of a warped version of these elements, though oddly enough still manages to tell the same kind of story. Its style and overall structure may divide audiences a bit and feel more like a cult favorite compared to the more mainstream franchises, but I personally enjoyed the movie for its quirkiness (a little bit of Vaughn's residual days working on Lock, Stock and Snatch, perhaps?). With a somewhat underwhelming video transfer, perfect audio, and a boatload of extras, Kick-Ass comes highly recommended, especially for fans.</p></body></html>

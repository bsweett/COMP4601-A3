If your answer is "bloody revenge," then you pretty much know what Odlboy is about.  Or do you?<br /><br />This is a revenge flick, make no mistake.  All the genre hallmarks are in place, but this is much more than Kill Bill Korea or a Seoul version of a Charles Bronson blast fest, believe it or not, there's some real heart at work here.  Director Park Chan-wook takes obvious western influences and crafts a completely unique odyssey of death and even redemption.  Choi Min-sik is a miracle worker in his portrayal of the avenging angel Oh Dae-su.  His performance is probably one of the best to come out of any film in the last 20 or 30 years.<br /><br />The serpentine manga story of Oldboy is judiciously revealing and though oweing nods to Tarantino, de Palma and even Robert Towne, as I said before, it feels original at every turn.  The action is similar. The hallway hammer fight is a brilliant example of where western action seems to always get it wrong.  Clearly Asian in style, Park's uncutting wide angle camera gives us everything without bumpy cameras and non-stop edits to break the dance of carnage or the tension.  There are no cheats here, we get it all in mass quantity.  And that goes for everything else in the film, like it or not.  Oldboy is a poster child for the eruption of excellent South Korean films in the last ten years and the pinnacle of the masochistic gangster genre that has become so popular on the south end of the peninsula.  Oldboy is an incredibly violent film.  It's not really Goodfellas violent, it's more Peckinpah or Marathon Man to me.  Yet for all the torture and brutality, Park Chan-wook  has a made a film that feels as violent as it needs to be to tell its story.  This one is not for the kids and also not very everybody.  It is a genuinely adult odyssey, and even then perhaps only for a few.<br /><br />I feel there is a real kinship between Oldboy and Beat Takeshi's Violent Cop. But this one has real depth of story and character where Violent Cop was exercise.  The journey we go on is a long one and though the ending is needlessly "artsy" it is a satisfying trip and easily the finest, deepest and most polished of Park's vengeance trilogy.  I'm sure some greedy American producers are working on a remake but let's hope it never sees the light of day.  Even in South Korea many psuedo clones and even competent riffs like The Man from Nowhere miss the point.  Sight unseen, if a true remake ever comes, I'll skip the new one and take the old boy every time.</p></body></html>

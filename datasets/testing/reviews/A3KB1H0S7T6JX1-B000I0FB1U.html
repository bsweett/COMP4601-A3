Had enough yet?<br /><br />Jack Black (who seems to be going back and forth between a Mexican accent and an Italian accent), and most of the rest of the cast, are pretty weak and unconvincing in their respecting roles.<br /><br />In short, the music is bad, the plot/setting is rather uninteresting, while the dialogues and the acting are average and sometimes below average, and then there is Ana de la Reguera!  WOW!!!  A little "exposure" wouldn't have hurt, but anyway she does have POTENTIAL!<br /><br />It seems as though the actors/directors/producers went on vacation separately, while there they met up with each other at the hotel lounge over drinks, and then decided, on the spot, to make the best of their stay by doing a quick and easy film on the side for some extra cash/spending money.<br /><br />That said, at times it's so silly that it gets to be amusing...<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you're under 13 and/or are heavily intoxicated, and that's about it; no masterpiece here... Wait till they show it on TV.  2.5 stars</p></body></html>

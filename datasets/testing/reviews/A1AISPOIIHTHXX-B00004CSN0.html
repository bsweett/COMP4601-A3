<meta name="summary" content="It's about time these 2 were paired up"></head><body><p>Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both had their share of mob related films: Al's Scarface, all 3 Godfathers and Donnie Brasco, and Robert's Casino, Goodfellas and Godfather Part 2. This is the first time they've been paired up and it's thrilling to see.<p>Robert plays Neil Mccauley, a highly intelligent thief who goes around and fine points every single &quot;hit&quot; or robbery. Al plays Vincent Hanna, an LA detective who's away from his wife and house making for some bad moments at home. One tries to tie up loose ends and leave the country with his new woman, the other tries to get enough evidence on the other to nail him.<p>One of the key scenes(and also a bit original in terms of crime stories) is when Neil and Vincent having a cup of coffee and just talking rather than trying to beat each other up. It plays nicely and it's new as usually when heroes and villians meet, it's always one trying to stop the other, but here it's more &quot;sooner or later I'm going to get you, it's not today but one day&quot; scenes. Another key scene is when a bank heist goes horribly wrong as the cops get tipped off and Neil, Chris(Val Kilmer) have to fight their way through a street in Los Angeles and escape. It's a big joy to see.<p>The ending however leaves me a little disappointed. The film ends in a big one on one showdown between Neil and Vincent then it just ends. But several characters you never figure out what happens to them or what they're gonna do but it's a great film with 2 classic actors squaring off</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Did someone say CARLITO'S WAY? You've got to be kidding me!"></head><body><p>I read another review where someone slammed this film. Well, let me write this: that person thought Carlito's Way was a good film. Nuff said. Heat isn't for the fan of Hill Street Blues or even the Lethal Weapon series. It is a classy film with in-depth character development and a remarkable ability to make us root for the bad guys.  As for action? You won't be dissapointed if you're one for smart and well thought out robbery scenes. The cast is phenominal, a list that includes DeNiro, Pacino, Kilmer, Judd, Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Voight, among others. <p>Now, if you're a fan of Carlito's Way, I meant no offense but to say that Carlito's is a better film than Heat? Please. <p>Heat takes the cake(or should I say bank?) in terms of the cops and robbers genre.  The climax will have you on the edge of your seat. Surprisingly, there are some subtle messages in this film, one being that there isn't much that seperates the two lead characters, although one's good and one's bad. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

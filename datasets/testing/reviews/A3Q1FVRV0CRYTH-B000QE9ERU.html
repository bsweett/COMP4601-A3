<meta name="summary" content="For a superhero movie it works pretty well..."></head><body><p>As far as superhero movies go, `The Punisher' serves up a very exciting and entertaining ride.  I've never read The Punisher comic books but I remember when the film was released I was excited to see it, it looked gritty and dark and violent and that's what I wanted to see.  Well, that's what I got.  The acting is very comic book dramatic, especially on the parts of John Travolta and Thomas Jane, but there are a few actors here that transcend that and pull off fine performances, those including Rebecca Romijn (I know it floored me too), Ben Foster and Will Patton who is just freaking awesome.  Thomas Jane plays Frank Castle, an ex-undercover cop who's last job when sour and some people were killed, one of those being the son of Howard Saint (Travolta), banker/money launderer and Saint declares revenge by mercilessly killing EVERYONE in Castle's family.  Castle then becomes The Punisher and goes on a spree taking out everyone close to Saint.  The action, while not non-stop, is a definite highlight to the film, but the movie has dramatic undertones to make this more than just your average superhero, beat-em-up type film but a film about a man trying to move on from a horrible event that changed his life.  It's a decent film that, while not pleasing everyone, is sure to please the action monger and or anyone who is fans of the comic or superhero adaptations in general.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's A Wonderful Film"></head><body><p>I have to make an admission that I'm not exactly proud of.  Despite numerous opportunities to see this film over the years outside of a few snippets I casually watched this is the first time I've seen "It's a Wonderful Life" in it's entirety.  I had no conscious resistance to the film.  When it was in the public domain it seemed like it was on TV every night on every channel so my thought was I'll catch it some other time.  Some other time finally came and, boy, was I wrong not to catch this cinematic treasure earlier.  This is not just a celebration of Christmas but a celebration of American idealism.  Bedford Falls, a microcosm of middle America, epitomizes the sense of community that we may not achieve but at least aspire to.  George Bailey(James Stewart) is our everyman who perserveres  despite the disappointments life throws at him.  Behind every good man there is a good woman and his wife Mary(Donna Reed) encapsulates that.  The film's basic premise is that every person has an impact on their community, for better or for worse, and despite the curveballs thrown our way life is worth living.  In lesser hands this theme could have been greeting card hokum but in director Frank Capra's hands it is life affirming.</p></body></html>

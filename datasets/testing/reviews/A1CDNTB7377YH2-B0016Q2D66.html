<meta name="summary" content="A Case of a Husband Not Ever Actually "Hearing" His Wife"></head><body><p>Dark period piece about a 1950's couple (Winsett and DeCaprio) who meet at a party in Manhattan.  She is an aspiring actress and he is a fun guy with very few aspirations other than being something like a delivery guy.<br /><br />The scene shifts forward a few years and Kate is in a play that is apparently a dud.  Leo, now her husband, tries to comfort her saying that at least she was the best thing about the dismal play.  This does nothing to quell her disappointment.  He than pulls the car over (they were driving) and starts yelling at her, telling her that it is unfair for her to be blaming him for her failure (this was not true).  He nearly hits her and this scene is a harbinger of things to come.<br /><br />Throughout the film it seems that Kate's dreams are constantly shattered while Leo muddle's through life oblivious to her needs.  Kate feels that her life as a housewife in a suburban home with two kids (that was supposed to be the American dream back then) is a boring existance and her husband constantly tells her how boring his job is and that he only keeps it to pay the bills.<br /><br />Kate comes up with an idea where they will go to Paris to live.  Leo had always told her it was the most fun place he had ever been to.  She thinks that this would be perfect as she would put meaning to both of their lives where she can work and support him until he figures out what he wants to do rather than toil away at something meaningless.<br /><br />The whole thing sounds like a chance to live out a possible dream but Leo does everything to thwart it.  Whether it be starting up an affair with a girl in the steno pool or wanting to stay at the job he has because his father worked there for twenty years.<br /><br />The realtor (Cathy Bates) that sold them their house becomes a regular friend of theirs and convinces them to let her bring her son to visit even though he currently resides in a mental institution.  The son may be crazy but he is the only one who sees their relationship for what it really is and has an uncanny knack for seeing through lies.<br /><br />As the movie goes on Leo keeps killing his wife's dreams to a point that she becomes unfeeling and kind of crazy herself.  I liked this film for showing that the American dream of the 50's wasn't all it was cracked up to be.</p></body></html>

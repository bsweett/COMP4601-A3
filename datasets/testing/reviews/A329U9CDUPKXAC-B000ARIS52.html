It's mostly in black and white but it's beautiful nonetheless. The use of shadows and light is amazing. Each of the stories I found interesting but it did take a little while to develop an interest in each one of them. I think the movie ran a little long but, still, I really enjoyed it. It made me want to read the comic. I hope there's a Sin City 2.</p></body></html>

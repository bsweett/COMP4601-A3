<meta name="summary" content="Not as bad as one would think"></head><body><p>What can one say about a film based on a comic book franchise? One hardly expects high drama, an insight into society or a considered view of the world. What one expects is some reasonable form of escapist entertainment. This is probably not such a bad thing as some of the better films can hardly be seen to have been made with ponderous seriousness. Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, Casabalanca are effective films but in the intellectual stakes they hover around the Mills and Boon romance thriller level.<br /><br />One of the surprising things with this film are that the director appears somewhat brighter than for instance the film makers of the European Dogma movement who get a superior press. (I note however that among the fans of the genre he appears to be not highly regarded.)  The extras provided by the DVD have the director talking about the construction of the characters the development of the plot the attempt to make some logically consistent world in which the events take place. The impression one gets in watching him talk is of a talented and thoughtful craftsman rather than a dullard churning out a hackneyed plot. Still one would expect that as the amount of money riding on a project such as this would be considerable compared to a film made by a Danish film maker using a hand held camera and an improvised plot.<br /><br />The difficulty is however that if one makes a monster movie how to make it interesting. Part of the attraction of films such as Alien and Predator is that the films reveal the nature of the monster and his world during the course of the film. Surprise and fining out what is going on is part of the enjoyment of the film. By the time that this film is made the types of monsters one is dealing with are well known it becomes difficult to make the plot interesting. Of course Alien, Predator and Aliens had the same plot. A number of characters are put in a position of vulnerability. The role of most of the characters is to die at intervals increasing the tension with eventually one or two of the characters surviving by besting an adversary of supernatural power. Now with Alien, Aliens and Predator we did not know that the plot was going to work out on those lines. However by the time we get to Alien and Predator we have monsters whose characteristics are well known and we have some humans who we know will end up as cannon fodder with maybe one or two being destined to survive. It is hard to watch a film of this type when you can predict the drift and the main interest is to figure out who will be the Arnie or Sigourney character.<br /><br />In this film there is an attempt to vary the mix by making one of the predators a character. In fact they are like humans in that they use tools, computers and have a verbal culture. The aliens can act as a group, open doors and so forth but they play the role of Hemingway like big game to be hunted by the predators.<br /><br />The filmmakers try to give the film some overall logic by suggesting an Eric Van Daniken theory for the development of human society. Interstellar visitors have given man certain skills so that they can use Earth as a sort of game reserve or training base.<br /><br />The film sort of works if you try hard to lock out the various plot absurdities. The human characters act irrationally and stupidly in such a way as to make themselves vulnerable to both the alien species. Even in doing something like climbing a mountain or exploring subterranean caves real people take more precautions than this lot does. However the characters in this film not only discover a vast subterranean feature that emits huge amounts of energy but a gigantic tunnel is drilled mysteriously.  One would think that this might lead to some radio messages home or a bit of discussion about how to proceed. Not in science fiction movie land.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Great Indiana Jones Adventure Collection!""></head><body><p>Harrison Ford stars as archaeologist, Indiana Jones in Steven<br />Spielberg's adventure films. Raiders of the Lost Ark -(1981)<br />An archaeologist races Nazis to find the Ark of the Covenant.<br />Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom -(1984) Indiana Jones<br />searches for an ancient stone stolen from an Indian village.<br />Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade -(1989) Indiana Jones<br />rescues his father and searches for the Holy Grail. These<br />are great films and Indy is one of Harrison's best roles.<br />It's nice to have all these films together that have good<br />picture and sound plus a 4th bonus disc with neat extras.<br />Get this great collection.</p></body></html>

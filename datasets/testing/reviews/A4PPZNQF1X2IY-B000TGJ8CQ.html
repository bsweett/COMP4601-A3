There are a few holes in the story and questions about how his gift actually works,<br />but the beauty is it that they keep the action excellently paced which<br />makes it an enjoyable experience.  It's a bit cheesy in parts, but has enough clever twists that keep you engaged and trying to figure out what else may be in store.  Another solid performance by Cage.</p></body></html>

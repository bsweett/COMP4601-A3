A lone crusader, who can destroy a small army of thugs, gets to romance all the ladies, ultimately prevails. Danny Trejo is Machete, whose family has been killed by Steven Seagal. He is such a natural fit for this role with his deadpan expression, rugged frame; he gets to deliver the funniest lines in the movie thanks to a wickedly written script. This movie is set against the backdrop of border politics and has a slew of characters with Robert De Niro playing his silliest role in years. If you want entertainment and hefty doses of action, nudity, violence and ridiculousness then this is the film to watch. Pretty enjoyable for what it is....Four stars. 2/20/11</p></body></html>

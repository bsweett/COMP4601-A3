<meta name="summary" content=""Take me with you to Alderaan!""></head><body><p>There's nothing for me here! I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi, like my father!" Perhaps the best line ever uttered in a sci-fi movie. What can I say? This is one of the top five best movies ever produced, and the second best in the sci-fi genre, nipping at the heels of its paterfamilias, "2001: A Space Odyssey", without which it would have probably looked quite different than it did.<br /><br />How Lucas came from "American Graffiti" to this monster is a mystery. Though his love for sci-fi was quite evident in his first movie, "THX-1138", where did he get 1) The filmmaking acumen, 2) the money, 3) the technically adept people to pull "New Hope" off? This alone had to be a feat unequalled since Kubrick got together with Arthur C. Clarke and Douglas Trumbull to make "2001".<br /><br />"New Hope" had that magic touch that had you rooting for the heroes at every turn, predisposing you to this by painting the Empire as the very embodiment of evil....destroying Luke's home and BURNING Beru and Owen, blowing up Leia's homeworld and killing Obi Wan. By doing this, you cannot HELP but cheer as Luke and his rebel friends destroy Death Star in the climactic scene. You also can't help but chuckle at characters like Princess Leia, Han Solo and R2D2. Personally, I could have lived without C3PO in ALL the SW movies!, but he's present here too as the prissy opposite number to the much more useful R2.<br /><br />Watch all three first trilogy movies...and you'll notice a DISTINCT change in the actors playing Luke and Leia. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher just BARELY resemble their "New Hope" selves in the succeeding movies! Mark Hamill's entire face seems to change from one with an aqualine nose and sun bleached blond hair to one with a pug nose, a much meaner mien to the entire face, and sandy BROWN hair. Carries Fisher's whole face goes from being round and pudgy to being elongated and gaunt, though she still pretty much resembles the "New Hope" Leia. Her voice, however, changes completely, going from tomboyish but still feminine in "New Hope", to being raspy and whiskey-soaked by "Jedi".<br /><br />All in all, this is the one that sets the pace for the others, and is STILL the best one as far as pathos and pure edge-of-your-seat drama: The destruction of Luke's farm and the murder of his guardian Aunt and Uncle; the destruction of Alderaan by Grand Muff Tarkin; the trash-compactor scene; the rebel pilots being picked off one by one by the Empire fighters during the Death Star run by Luke's friends. The last minute save by Han Solo...this film couldn't have been a more perfect matinee entertainment if it tried!<br /><br />Special mention has to be made of Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing, especially Cushing, who gave perhaps his best film performance ever in this film as the supremely evil Tarkin. The sad thing connected with this film is the lackluster career Mark Hamill has had since "Jedi". Though he was, hands-down, the star of what was for quite some time the most popular film ever, he couldn't give himself away by the mid-eighties.<br /><br />The fickle fortunes of Hollywood, I ask you.....</p></body></html>

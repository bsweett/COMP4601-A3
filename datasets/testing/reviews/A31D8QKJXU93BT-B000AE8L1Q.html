<meta name="summary" content="Anger Mismanagement"></head><body><p>Director Mike Binder wrote this comedy for the reliable Joan Allen, with whom he acted in "The Contender," and she's all right in it as a wife whose husband deserts her and their four daughters. Kevin Costner is better as an ex-baseball star and radio jock who lives nearby and longs for stability. Binder himself, as Costner's producer, makes a believable jerk. They are the only reasons for watching this pointless and unpleasant picture. Between the subplot clutter and self-absorbed characters, there is nothing to admire and nobody to like. The surprise ending does not surprise and, in fact, aborts the film's premise.<br /><br />Directors usually try to cast actors who resemble siblings or a parent, but no effort was made here; the teenagers are attractive but disparate (and spend a lot of time in the kitchen.) Costner's umpteenth turn at bat is a two-base hit, charmingly fey. Allen, as resourceful and serious a stage and screen actress as we have, mostly acts drunk, uncaring and rude, as though booze excuses bad behavior. When we're finally asked to pity her, we don't. The actress confides in a disc extra that she really wanted to try comedy. I'm afraid that challenge still awaits her.</p></body></html>

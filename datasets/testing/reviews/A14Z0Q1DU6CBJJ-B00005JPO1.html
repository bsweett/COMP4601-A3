<meta name="summary" content="HIT and MISS JONES"></head><body><p>INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULLS has all the elements of the series: the whip, the sarcasm, the heroics, the cobwebs, the puzzles, Karen Allen, but at the same time, shoots itself in the foot with over-the-top stunts (even for Indiana Jones) and surprisingly enough... a lack of creativity.<br /><br />There were great things about THE CRYSTAL SKULLS. The opening moments in the warehouse were top notch Indiana Jones. Cate Blanchett was phenominal. In fact, the nuclear city and the diner were interesting, funny and good leads in to an adventure movie. Karen Allen's return put a smile across my face. The graveyard scene was excellent as the skeletons seem to emerge from the dark crevaces of the multi-layered cemetary.<br /><br />Yet, then there were the moments that were so ridiculous, even for Indiana Jones, that the stunt and effect had the exact opposite effect that the Directors intended... at least on this viewer. The first... was the motorcycle sliding under the tables in the library. Then the kid apparently didn't hear the motorcycle or the commotion looks up from his book. Wow. That was bad.<br /><br />The waterfalls... 3 of them. Everybody just crawls back into the boats and goes on with business. Silly. A swordfight as Mutt Williams stradles 2 jeeps racing through the jungle. Yet, the biggest turn off of the entire film was a scene where Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) decides to drive off a cliff. I know that the point was to show that she has just as much balls as Indiana Jones, but... she drives off the cliff as if she had it planned ahead of time that the tree branch 100 feet down would catch them... lower them down to the water gently and then swing back up and hit the soldiers climbing the cliff wall. The whole thing was ridiculous as it gets.<br /><br />Then of course there was the ending that was way too similar to RAIDERS. Couldn't they have thought of something new?<br /><br />I guess my biggest gripe is that names like SPIELBERG and LUCAS would be so shameless as to stoop to the cheap thrills level that EMMERICH, BAY and WISEMAN do with their summer movies. Lets just throw in some OVER the top stunts to please the popcorn popping crowd.<br /><br />Note to movie makers: Stunts aren't exciting when people can't imagine them being pheasible. They're just ridiculous and forgettable. More is not always the best option.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES IN THE CRYSTAL SKULLS is a 3 star movie. It's okay. Yet, I give it just 2 stars because SPIELBERG and LUCAS... should have known better. After nearly twenty years... you'd think that the story would have been more thought out and they wouldn't have had to coat their movie with ridiculous over the top stunts to cover it up.</p></body></html>

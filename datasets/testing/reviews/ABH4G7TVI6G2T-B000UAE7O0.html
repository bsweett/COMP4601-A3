<meta name="summary" content=""Now you've got a gal in your wrecked truck with a missing leg? A missing leg that's now missing?""></head><body><p>It's "Night of the Living Dead" meets "Showgirls" meets "Smokey and the Bandit"...!<br /><br />When toxic biochemicals are released into the Earth's atmosphere, transforming innocent bystanders into flesh-guzzling zombies, mankind's only hope lies with former go-go dancer Cherry (Rose McGowan), who wears a machine-gun in place of an amputated leg...one of her many "useless talents"...<br /><br />That's the bizarre plot of PLANET TERROR, writer/director Robert Rodriguez's homage to the blood-spattered, beaten-up horror movies of the 1970s.  This was originally part of the double-feature presentation "Grindhouse" along with Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF, and whilst both movies play well as a double feature, you can easily enjoy PLANET TERROR as a stand-alone movie experience.<br /><br />Rose McGowan is a natural fit for the role of Cherry; and it's a complete mystery--to this reviewer at least--why it's taken her so long to be the leading lady of an action/horror film; she's perfect!  Rodriguez's script is totally tongue-in-cheek with lots of fun references and cliches for the veteran horror experts.  Marley Shelton, Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, Freddy Rodriguez, and "The Crazy Babysitter Twins" co-star.<br /><br />The Blu-ray comes stacked with extras, including director commentary, cast interview featurettes, "scratch-free" version of the movie, audience reaction track, "Film School" tutorial featurette and BD-Live components.  The perfect movie for starting a lazy weekend!</p></body></html>

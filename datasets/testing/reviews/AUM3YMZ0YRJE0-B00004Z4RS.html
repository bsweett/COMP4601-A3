<meta name="summary" content="even longtime fans of the comic will like this one"></head><body><p>This is a beautiful, dark film that is perfectly cast.  The X-men and all their struggles really come alive in this one, along with some great action sequences and effects.  <p>I have read this comic for nearly 35 years, from its beginnings to the present day.  Never would have I expected that these characters could be portrayed with any depth on the screen!  But they are in this film, from Wolverine to Cyclops.  <p>Brilliant.  And better than all the other attempts to bring comics to the screen.</p></body></html>

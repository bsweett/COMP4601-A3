Both period pieces featuring magicians, with big stars I like in the lead roles (Edward Norton and Christian Bale, respectively), both with a big mystery at the forefront. Burger was a relatively new director making a big splash, while Nolan had established himself with a really, really great movie, then had turned around and tarnished his reputation with one of the worst remakes imaginable (Insomnia). Needless to say, Ladbroke's could have opened a pool on which one would be better, if there were any objective criteria for judging such a thing. (Both, as it turns out, were nominated for the Best Cinematography Oscar; both, quite deservedly, lost to El Laberinto del Fauno. The Prestige also picked up a nom for Best Art Direction. Guess what it lost to.) Well, I've now seen both, and while they're both enjoyable, I'm coming down on the side of the apes in this debate: I liked The Illusionist a lot better.<br /><br />The story concerns two magicians, Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who work their way up through the ranks as partners until a tragic onstage accident results in the death of Angier's wife Julia (Cheaper by the Dozen's Piper Perabo). The two become rivals, with their rivalry leading to Angier's own demise. This is not a spoiler; the opening scene of the movie shows us Borden being convicted of the crime. The question is, was there a crime at all? Much of the movie is told in flashback, showing us the manipulations that led to the trial.<br /><br />And this is its greatest weakness; the complex time structure of the film is in no way delineated, making it exceptionally hard to follow for much of its length. By the time you get into the rhythm of the time changes, the movie shifts back to the present. Thanks, Chris! On the upside, however, you've got an amazing stable of actors (aside from the above, a quick core sample reveals Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, David Bowie, and Ricky Jay), and they all perform at least reasonably well, while Nolan's directing still seems to be climbing back up; he still hasn't reached the pinnacle of Memento again, but he's getting there. (Interestingly, Memento is well-known for how deftly Nolan handled playing with the time element there; what happened here?) And, well, it does lack Rufus Sewell. There are very few movies that would not be improved by Rufus Sewell, who chewed so much wonderful scenery in The Illusionist.<br /><br />Still, for all that, if you can figure out the time element in The Prestige, which may take a few viewings, it's got a meaty mystery, some great emotional manipulation (by the characters, not by the director; this is a positive mark for any film coming out of emotionally-manipulative Hollywood these days), and a fun, if predictable, twist. Just remember: there are some things a cold chisel should never be used for. ***</p></body></html>

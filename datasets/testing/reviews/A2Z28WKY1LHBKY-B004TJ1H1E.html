<meta name="summary" content="Funny. But wordy. But funny."></head><body><p>There can be no doubt that this is a funny, witty, ingenious and highly original film. There is great depth in the understated analysis of male/female conventional behaviour. However, while most of the critical reviews here seem stupefyingly dumb (the plot isn't realistic, the gangsters are murderous, etc) I do have to agree with those who think it is just a little too long and a bit verbose. As usual, I can't understand why so many people think it is necessary or useful to summarize the plot; so I won't. Joe E.Brown has a truly remarkable face. Both Curtis and Lemmon are excellent in their multiple roles --- given that there is just too much dialogue written for them. Although why so many people think that Curtis speaks like Cary Grant beats me. Nobody talks like that. The first time I saw this movie I didn't know he was imitating anybody --- least of all Cary Grant. Perhaps that's the way Grant sounds to Americans. Deadpan George Raft is superb in his part as Spats, better than in any of his gangster films. Marilyn is an impossible, unbelievable dream. So ripe, so luscious, like a slightly bruised peach.</p></body></html>

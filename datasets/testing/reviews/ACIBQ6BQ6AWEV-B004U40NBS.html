Although it was not well received on its debut, over time the ballet has become a world-wide favorite, and it is particularly noted for the fact that the prima ballerina must play both the virginal White Swan "Odette" and her alter ego, the wanton and evil Black Swan "Odile."  Directed by Darren Aronofsky and with story and script fashioned by writers Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin, BLACK SWAN pivots on this schism--and owes a significant debt to three other notable films: PERSONA, in which two women have a relationship that confuses their personalities; THE RED SHOES, in which a ballerina becomes excessively involved in her role; and REPULSION, in which a sexually disturbed young woman collapses into insanity.  The film also owes a debt to such films as MULHOLLAND DR in the sense that it is difficult to know what is really happening to the ballerina and what is only occurring in her own mind.<br /><br />In a general sense, the story concerns ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), who has spent her career in the corps de ballet and whose great ambition as a dancer is to be absolutely perfect--an ambition that has rendered her flawless in precision but a shade lacking in passion.  When the company's leading ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) is essentially dismissed due to increasing age and an unstable temperment, Nina is announced as the star of a new production of SWAN LAKE.  Her confidence, however, is undermined by competing ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis), her suffocating mother (Barbara Hershey), and her choreographer (Vincent Cassel.) Under the pressure, and repeatedly told that she lacks the passion for the Black Swan, Nina begins to descend into a series of delusions that may be stress, personal fantasy, or flat out schizophrenia.  All of the moments are presented with remarkable power, and they lead to an uncertain but powerful conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is memorable throughout, and Natalie Portman justly walked away with an Oscar for her performance.  At the same time, the film is not without flaws.  The first half of the film feels somewhat slow and overall the movie is icy cold.  Since every one of them deeply competitive and resorts to manipulation in an effort to dominate others, none of the characters are likeable or sympathetic, and the progression of the film seemed a bit spotty to me, skipping from one point to another without always connecting the dots.  Even so, it is a truly intriguing film, wildly Freudian, intensely paranoid, and unusual in every way.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></body></html>

If you're willing to commit yourself for three hours and are looking for something more than just another "what a sick f**k!" film you're in for a disturbing, almost uncomfortably involving ride not through the mind of a killer, but through the mind of more or less innocent people who are torn apart by their inability to find him.<br /><br />I wouldn't call David Fincher a "great director" quite yet, but he's getting there: this movie proves that he isn't he just another renegade from MTV who got his hands on a camera.  Keep in mind, though: this is nothing like "Seven". (And fortunately for everyone it isn't anything like "Panic Room".)  That was more a work of dark imagination than anything else; this is horribly factual and only leaves a little bit out as far the actual case goes.  Robert Downey Jr., Brian Cox, Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal especially give very human, believable performances--almost to the point where you forget you're watching a movie.<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer was an erratic, power-minded psychopath whose reign of terror in Northern California is remembered very well by those who lived through it.  His reign of terror lasted from the late 60's to the early 70's, a fairly brief period of time for the average serial killer: but the Zodiac seemed more interested in playing power games with law enforcement--Mark Ruffalo plays David Toschi, the stressed out cop who had the misfortune of having to handle the case, and though most of the Zodiac's "codes" and messages seem at first to be directed toward ridiculing his status as a police officer, he keeps his cool as much as possible.<br /><br />Toschi was a tough cookie though, and a trained police officer.  Such was not the case with the Zodiac's more vulnerable prey, played by Robert Downey Jr. and Jake Gyllenhaal.  One is a reporter for the SF chronicle, the other is a cartoonist who should really have nothing to do with the case at all.  The Zodiac, with the sadistic sixth sense characteristic of murderers, lock onto both the these men and slowly suck the joy our of their lives while making them paranoid, fearful, and terminally obsessed with identifying the killer.  Spending their time getting drunk and trying to crack the puzzles sent in after each murder, the incomprehensibility of the situation brings them both to the brink of madness.<br /><br />Downey's character is already a little vulnerable (and he was great in this movie, people just slander him constantly because he's had very public substance abuse problems in my opinion) and frustrated.  He becomes non-functional and cracks while Glyenhaal's Robert Graysmith lets everything else in his life go to hell while pursuing the Zodiac long after the case is closed.<br /><br />The violence in this movie is more minimal than one would expect considering the subject.  There is one unforgettably horrifying scene with a couple who the Zodiac murdered in a SF park.  It is filmed with such distance and nonchalance that it chills right to the bone. No suspenseful music, nothing; just cold blooded, random murder.<br /><br />This does film does not have a happy or satisfying ending at all.  This is appropriate because the case did not have a happy ending; Arthur Lee Allen, a convicted child molester and a man of other blatantly deviant tendencies, is generally believed to have been the Zodiac.  He succesfully evaded capture and suffered a heart attack before he was formally charged with killings.  The last scene, in which Robert Graysmith finally gets what he wants and stands face to face with him, is in some ways more bone chilling than anything else in the film.  The expression on Allen's face is indescribably awful and smug.<br /><br />These killings took place in a time when some very basic technology was lacking in terms of law enforcement.  I doubt this could be pulled off with such evil braggadacio in the contemporary world, but the damage is already done.  The thing that concerns about movies as well done as this one is that they are based on actual cases, not even slightly distanced from real names and events.  It resurrects events--artfully--which certain diseased minds may want to recreate.  Not to say movies like this shouldn't be made, I certainly enjoyed it, but I sometimes think it would be better if aliases were used with respect to the people and suspects involved as a cautionary measure.  At any rate, a not just good but great film.</p></body></html>

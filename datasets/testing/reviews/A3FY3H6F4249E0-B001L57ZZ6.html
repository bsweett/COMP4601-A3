I would watch it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Picture the ultimate computer, that records data from all electronic devices and stores it. It runs profiles on people everywhere based on that data, to see who might represent a terrorist threat. It monitors cell phones, emails, text messages, computers, street cameras, bank cameras, and anything else while it searches for relevant information. It can access, alter, activate or shut down anything electronic. And if someone calls you on the phone and tells you to do something, you'd better do it! The 2 main characters, Jerry and Rachelle, were thrown together and take off through the story. Great storyline, great acting job. That's about all I can tell you, except that the computer obviously has its own agenda based on its internal programming.</p></body></html>

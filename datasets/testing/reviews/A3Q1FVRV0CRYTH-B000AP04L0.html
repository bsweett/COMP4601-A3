I saw this movie back when it was released and it has always resonated as the funniest movie ever, mostly because it pokes fun in the hilarity that is our lives.  There's nothing over the top about this film.  Peter (Ron Livingston) could be you, and you could have his life, and his luck, and thats the greatest part about this movie.  You can relate to the situations that make this film so enjoyable, and yes, hilarious.  Peter works a dead end job at a computerish type company with friends Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Na...Na..."Not gonna work here anymore" and they all hate it there.  There boss Lumbergh (Gary Cole) is a complete pain in the @$$ and Milton (Stephen Root) is well, weird.  (Actually Milton's subplot involving his employment - or lack there of - and his stapler serve as some of the funniest scenes in this film)  Peter's girlfriend Anne left him and he's trying to hook up with Joanne (Aniston) who is waitress at a local 'bennigans' type resterant.  When they finally get fed up with their situation they decide to take action and come up with a scam to rip off the company.  Hilarity ensues as their plan backfires.  David Herman serves as the funniest person here, with his pure hatred for the singer Michael Bolton and life in general.  Diedrich Bader plays Peter's hilarious hillbilly neighbor.  This is a great film that will supply more laughs than not and should be seen by everyone!</p></body></html>

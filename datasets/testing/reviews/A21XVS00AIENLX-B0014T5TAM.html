Nonetheless, the film was cinematically pleasing.  Some of the dialogue is rather simplistic.  However, you have to keep in mind the story is told from the viewpoint of a thirteen-year-old girl whose testimony caused a serious disruption in the lives of her sister and the lover.  The actors are essentially acting  out how young Briony, our main character, sees these circumstances.  Briony spends all her life trying to overcome her guilt for what she put the lovers through.  I can see how incredibly hard it must have been for director Joe Wright to adapt this intrinsic story into a visual masterpiece the audience could comprehend.  It is easy to get bored, and the beginning is rather slow. Be  patient with it.  Everything and every character has a purpose.  It all becomes clear at the end of the movie.  Vanessa Redgrave and James McAvoy were great, but Keira didn't do so hot this time.  Focused, yes, but her lines were often preemptive and forced.  That's great for Elizabeth Bennett.  Not suitable for vulnerable Cecilia.<br /><br />Not quite Best Picture worthy, but definitely deserving of some awards.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Should have been titled Iron Men"></head><body><p>Of course it is important to understand that this is a movie based on a comic strip.  It is not and was never intended to be great cinematic art but it is a fun movie and entertaining.<br /><br />Property Destruction = 4 stars -- The Taliban must be dying of envy<br />Special effects = 3 stars -- lack of creativity and more and more iron men doesn't make the special effects better.<br />Screen Play = 4 stars -- saved by final scene with Senator Stern which was very clever<br />Character Development  = 4 stars -- Good supporting cast<br />Acting = 4 stars -- Downey may be a waste as a person but he has immense talent and it is fully used in this movie.  Well done.  Paltrow also does a great job and given a much better chance to show her talent in this sequel. Mickey Rourke also did an excellent job especially with the accent.  In fact the entire cast did a great job.<br />Sound track = 2 stars -- the sound track at the beginning was so annoying it destracted from the movie rather than enhancing it.<br />Personal Hygiene = 1 star -- I am sort  of tired of seeing the leading men walking around looking like they haven't shaved in days or taken  a bath in weeks.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is a fun movie -- not quite as good as the original but fun nevertheless. Downey and Paltrow are a pleasure to watch and probably saved the movie because it would be hard to imagine anyone else playing these parts.</p></body></html>

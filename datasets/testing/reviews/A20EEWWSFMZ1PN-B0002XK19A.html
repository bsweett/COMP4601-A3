<meta name="summary" content="Peter Parker is hooked on Mary Jane"></head><body><p>This movie takes up where the first one left off. Peter (Toby Maguire) has fallen on bad times he is a loner happy because he knows as Spiderman he can not have friends including Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst); the bad guys would use his friends as pawns. Everything is going to pot. He loses his job, cant pay his rent, his aunt is on foreclosure, he can not make schedule on anything he does. His best friend is out to get Spiderman. And heaven forbid he is falling behind in school.<br /><br />Looks like it is decision time between his Spidy personality and Mary Jane Watson.<br />Which does he chose?<br />Which would you chose?<br />Is there a way out of the dilemma?<br /><br />This film is very slow moving and depressing for at least the first third. They are relying on the reputation of the first Spiderman to carry this almost similar story. When the action picks up that is all it is just action. You may want to fast forward through this as nothing is said or reveled that will have any bearing on the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Incontrovertible evidence that classic movies look great on Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>There has been a long-standing misconception that "old" movies can't benefit from a high definition transfer. Well, it was wrong before, and it's still wrong now. But pop this Blu-Ray disc in your player, and no one will ever suspect it is true again.<br /><br />Ben-Hur is presented in a two-disc edition that basically includes just the movie and commentary, split across two discs. This is a nice alternative to paying forty plus for an edition that includes all kinds of "collectors" junk and a giant box that won't fit on your shelf anyway. The movie is of course a classic, and I find it to be pretty absorbing and entertaining. Heston gives some of his most nuanced work, and the supporting cast is all good.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the transfer itself, it has many high points:<br />-Very strong detail across the entire range, large and small, near and far. Faces show tiny beads of sweat, cloth shows realistic texture, foliage and stones pop with realism.<br />-Very light film grain is evident, whereas no DNR or EE is evident.<br />-Very strong colors, especially the reds of the Roman uniforms. Flesh tones are pleasingly realistic.<br />-Good dimensionality in bright shots, less so in dark shots.<br />-Excellent and solid black levels, with a good amount of detail near black.<br />-Very few shots besides process shots show some degradation of the film elements. I counted two dropped frames, and about ten seconds worth of print damage manifesting itself in some wavering colors.<br /><br />Basically, in every way except special effects and lighting choices (that is, many interior shots are realistically lit, and thus look somewhat dark to an eye trained by the likes of Michael Bay), this transfer is competitive with any on the market today, and stands as probably the single best 65mm transfer available. It is WAY better than the unfortunate botched transfer job on "Spartacus," and it is a terrific companion piece to "The Ten Commandments," also on Blu-Ray. Between these two classic epics, there should no longer be any doubt that classic films can look superb in HD. Any film fan should buy this right away, especially at this reduced price!<br /><br />By the way, if you are interested in getting the third disc from the bigger set, I suggest importing from Amazon.co.uk. There is a 3-disc edition with none of the superfluous stuff from the box. It will cost you more than the 2 disc set, but still much less than the big box. The Blu-Ray itself is region free, so it will play in any American player. Don't ask me why WB insists on giving the US market an all-or-nothing choice.</p></body></html>

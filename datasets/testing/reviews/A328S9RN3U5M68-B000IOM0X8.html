<meta name="summary" content="A Dandy Summer Popcorn Movie"></head><body><p>SAHARA is one of those films to view when escapism is the goal of the evening.  Made along the same lines as the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' genre, mixing adventure with comedy, a smattering of love interest, a dollop of social comment, and some pretty fine scenery that creates a stage for likeable actors such as  Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy, Delroy Lindo, and Lambert Wilson, SAHARA succeeds in pulling off an interesting caper film.<br /><br />Not having read the apparently sacrosanct novel by Clive Cussler upon which the film is based, this 2 hour plus film seemed to putt along without any great shakes, without much in the way of character development, without any hint of screen chemistry between Cruz and McConaughey, but with the surprise pleasure of watching Steve Zahn steal the scenes with his comic talent. It is that kind of film - not to be taken seriously or valued higher than its intent.  It is just entertainment - and there is nothing wrong with that!  Grady Harp, August 05</p></body></html>

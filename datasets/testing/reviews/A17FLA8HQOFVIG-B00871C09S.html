<meta name="summary" content="A Hitchcock classic revisited"></head><body><p>This 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic was nominated for four Academy awards.  I remember seeing it years ago and loving it.  Seeing it again, I'm reminded of the way things used to be, and it is certainly worthwhile as a retro experience.  It's interesting to see the clothing styles and the dial telephones.  There's also a mystery that kept me interested.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is cast in the role of a photographer with a broken leg.  He's confined to his apartment which is supposed to be in New York's Greenwich village.  From his window, he observes his neighbors.  And the apartment house across the street just happens to be designed in a way that he can look into the windows of all the apartments and get a bird's eye view into the lives other people's lives.  Every day a nurse, played by Thelma Ritter, comes to look in on him.  She shares his interest in his neighbors and she counsels him about his love life.  It seems his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, wants to marry him but he holds back because she is a society girl and he doubts if she can fit into his life of international travel to a wide variety of war-torn and isolated places.  But as the film progresses, she gets more and more involved in what he suspects is a murder in the apartment across the courtyard.  She's beautiful, of course, with an unnaturally tiny waistline which was the style in those days, and she plays her part well.  Raymond Burr is cast in the role of the supposed murderer.  Did he or did he not kill his wife?  This is the storyline that keeps the audience guessing.<br /><br />The plot moves swiftly and it certainly captured my interest.  And Hitchcock had a way of capturing suspense that is unique.  It is successful as a film in most ways.  But it's 2010 now I'm a bit jaded.  That why, in spite of my giving this film a high recommendation, I'm not exactly sure that it has stood the test of time.</p></body></html>

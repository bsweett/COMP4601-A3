<meta name="summary" content="Conventional Musical that Relies Heavily on Real-Life Allusions."></head><body><p>"Dreamgirls" is a cinematic version of the Tony award-winning musical that had a 4-year run on Broadway in the 1980s. Inspired by 1960s R&B girl groups and the rise of Motown Records, the musical follows the personal trials and career triumphs of a trio called "The Dreams". By making subtle changes in the characters' circumstances, the movie associates The Dreams more closely with The Supremes than the stage musical did. Although it's easy to identify the movie's inspirations in the history of The Supremes, this is clearly a fictionalized account that has just enough real life to tantalize the audience. The film introduces some new songs but has less music than the stage production, as it's shorter.<br /><br />Three hopeful young women sing their way into the audience's hearts at a Detroit talent show, where they are spotted by Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), an ambitious manager who thinks the ladies are just what aging R&B star Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy) needs to revitalize his act. Curtis signs "The Dreamettes" as back up singers and sends them on tour. Determined to achieve success on the pop charts, Curtis makes them a stand-alone act, moving willful, talented Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) to backup role and replacing her with the pretty, slighter chanteuse Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), who, along with backup singer Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), become "The Dreams". The act is a hit, but Effie's resentment and Curtis' stifling control breed behind-the-scenes strife.<br /><br />"Dreamgirls" is a slick, competent, thoroughly conventional musical that doesn't find its footing until about halfway through. The first hour is frankly dull. But the story becomes more compelling as it progresses and tensions between the characters heighten. I wasn't impressed by the singing. I would expect better on Broadway. But The Supremes were never strong singers, and the lovely Beyonce Knowles, who rose to stardom helming girl group Destiny's Child, is the perfect choice for Diana Ross-inspired Deena. Jennifer Hudson won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her Florence Ballard-inspired role. There is no subtlety in the performances, but if I had to choose a stand-out, it would be Eddie Murphy. In any case, there are enough showmanship and intriguing insinuations in "Dreamgirls" to satisfy.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc include 12 Extended and Alternate Scenes, and a Music Video (4 min) for the song "Listen" performed by Beyonce Knowles. Subtitles for the movie are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

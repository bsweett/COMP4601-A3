<meta name="summary" content="Its not on par with Jaws and other good movie"></head><body><p>I usually rent, but i paid for this flick, cause it was advertized as on<br />par with other good monster movie.  The monster itself is good, detailed<br />and original and is a joy to look at, but the rest of the movie could have<br />been done better.  At some point i think i fell asleep for a while.<br />I hope the american can remake it better, it deserves another chance.<br />Dont buy...rent !</p></body></html>

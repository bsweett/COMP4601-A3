The mood and atmosphere of the film was eerie and creepy, but nothing we haven't seen before. Julianne Moore did an excellent job as the terrified, confused and frightened mother, who has been told her son, who has been dead for 14 months, never existed. However, her abilities start to fall apart at about the same time as the movie does.<br /><br />This film begins to build a dynamic story very early on. Great twists and turns in this movie, so much so that I don't want to mention very much, except the initial premise that Julian Moore has been grieving for years about her lost son, and suddenly her husband, her doctor - everyone - has no memory of her son, they act is if Julianne has lost her mind. Unfortunately, it gets lost in itself and crumbles towards the middle and especially by the end.<br /><br />What probably started out as a decent alien abduction flick, turned sour and became another in a long line of Sixth Sense or The X-Files rip-offs. There was nothing that really jumped out and grabbed the viewer by the throat and made them afraid for their own children. I think that really could have been the selling point of this film. The make people afraid to let their children out of their sight. I mean, the idea of this happening in real life would be the scariest part of all. This film was building up to that, but again, it crumbled way too fast. The ending was different, but bland. Julianne Moore's character is able to overcome the odd experiment she is being forced through, because her love for her son is too strong.<br /><br />The Forgotten has some good action, some good mystery; and it would be an excellent Twilight Zone material. But it really works best if you don't know already how the story unfolds. Interesting, but a trifle underdeveloped and almost seemingly tacked on.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Edge of Insanity"></head><body><p>I would consider this movie to be a neo-gothic film. While everything appears to be normal, as far as normal would go for a mental institution in the 1950s, there is always an unsettling element in the mix. The music and the camera angles used also assist greatly is setting the mood for this film.<br /><br />This movie unfolds like a maze, and it has you going down different rabbit holes, firstly, there is the issue of the missing female patient, that has disappeared under almost an impossible situation. Then there is a former Nazi doc, that raises the question of experimental brain surgery.<br /><br />The suspense develops as the weather deteriorates, the Federal Marshals get soaked in the rain and must dodge falling trees. Subsequently, they are provided with in-mate clothes and now sleep in bunk beds provided. The question that now presents itself, is: will they ever be allowed to leave the island? More questions and paranoia is thrown into the mix to keep you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This is a very gripping suspense thriller and keeps the maze going, and blurs reality and hallucination until the very end. A great movie that keeps you thinking as the plot turns and bends.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Highly enjoyable flick"></head><body><p>Pixar has delivered solid hits like Toy Story, and this movie certainly rivals Toy Story. It's a great movie for adults AND kids... though perhaps not all kids, as there were a few moments in the movie that would be quite scary for very young or easily sensitive ones. But at 4.5/5 stars, this movie is a great twist on the old 'monster-in-the-closet' bogeyman tale with a surprisingly heartwarming ending.</p></body></html>

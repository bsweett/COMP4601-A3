<meta name="summary" content="To The Rescue"></head><body><p>Like the citizens of Metropolis, I didn't realize how much I missed the Man of Steel until I once again witnessed Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) running down Main Street, shedding his clothes and setting sail to save the day for the first time in Bryan Singer's big, beautiful, fast paced, masculine yet very touching take on the Superman franchise, "Superman Returns."<br />Routh's Kent/Superman, a superb creation of director Bryan Singer ("Usual Suspects," "XMen"), Dan Harris ("Imaginary Heroes) and others, is as usual na?ve, befuddled and endearing as Kent but this Superman, along with being strong, upstanding, driven and sure of himself, is also very emotional and human...a mensch: outwardly a product of the love bestowed upon him by his adoring adopted mother (Eva Marie Saint) and his girlfriend Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth).<br />Much of "SR" is jaw-droppingly gorgeous thanks to the superior work of Production Designer Guy Dyas and the visuals of Newton Thomas Sigel ("Three Kings," "Brothers Grimm"). In fact the first rescue sequence involving an aborted launch of a space shuttle with Lois on hand is truly amazing both in physical execution and emotional impact. Also of note is the way in which Superman levitates throughout the film: on the one hand almost balletic in movement on the other very much akin to the mechanical movement of a heliocopter.<br />"Superman Returns" and I for one am glad he's back.</p></body></html>

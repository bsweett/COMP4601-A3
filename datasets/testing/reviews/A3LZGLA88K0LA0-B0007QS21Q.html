<meta name="summary" content="I ROBOT U JANE"></head><body><p>I must admit I was prepared to dislike I ROBOT, simply because of its marketing and the presence of Will Smith, who although a talented and apparently likeable young man, is not one of my favorite actors.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ROBOT is a mindblowing exercise in technical wizardry and its borrowed Aasimov plotline is intriguing.  A surprisingly buff Smith plays a tortured detective who hates robots (we find out later in the film), and is joined by Bridget Moynahan as a scientist who helps "humanize" robots in a quest to find out why one robot has apparently murdered a human--a no no in the three laws of robots.  The suspect robot is wonderfully voiced by Alan Trydk (spelling) and he's a prime focus point in the film.<br /><br />The effects are brilliant and even though they may go over the top (particularly in the spectacular chase in the tunnel), they are certainly state of the art in their execution.<br /><br />Overall, I ROBOT is top notch science fiction entertainment.</p></body></html>

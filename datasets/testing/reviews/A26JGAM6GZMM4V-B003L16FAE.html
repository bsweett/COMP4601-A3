<meta name="summary" content="Conan: King of the Jungle"></head><body><p>Even after 17 years, I still enjoy this hybrid film which combines the best features of action adventure with special effects which create what is generally referred to as &quot;science fiction.&quot; Here's the basic situation: Major Alan (&quot;Dutch&quot;) Schaefer (Schwarzenegger) and his personal team of highly trained and highly skilled special operatives are enlisted by the CIA to go into an unnamed Latin American country to rescue others who had previously been assigned there on a special mission to....<br /><br /> Once the local guerillas have been summarily terminated, the assignment's original objective becomes irrelevant when all of Dutch's team are then systematically eliminated by a Super Creature (Kevin Peter Hall) whom they are powerless to resist. When the highly improbable climax occurs, only Dutch survives. The plot really makes no sense. It is merely a contrivance to support truly outstanding special effects. Somehow, Schwarzenegger and others in the cast (Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, and Jesse Ventura) sustain appropriate gravitas. Credit director John McTiernan and his crew with creating a highly entertaining cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

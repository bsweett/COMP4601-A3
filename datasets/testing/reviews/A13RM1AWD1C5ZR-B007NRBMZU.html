<meta name="summary" content="The Butterfly Effect- Whoa! It Was Good.....I'm Serious Too"></head><body><p>The Butterfly Effect was actually an entertaining thriller, with a fine performance, here me out on this, fine perfomance from Ashton Kutcher.  Debuting directors J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress create an interesting and intricate film, dealing with the chaos theory.  The theory that the flapping of a butterfly's wings can cause a typhoon halfway across the world. Okay, yes critics have without a doubt just panned this movie but it has pulled off a few positive and mixed reviews.  This movie may be a good enough and maybe even smart enough self-help thriller.  Some viewers may be drawn away from the intensity of it, let me say that first off it does make sense you just need to PAY ATTENTION.  It's an neat time-travel thriller, with some fine performances and effects.  The CGI is fine, not terrible as some people have said.<br />  Now analyzing Kutcher's performance is one hell of a fun assessment, sure it was good.  I'm serious, he can act and it's nice to see him turn from his childish and immature comic roles even though he is a riot.  This has been a great movie to start off the year and I'm pleased in seeing it.  The beautiful Amy Smart plays Kutcher's childhood freind and later on his love interest.<br />  The Butterfly Effect is rated R for Violence, Language, Sexual Content and Brief Drug Use.  The violence includes prison violence with intense fistfights in addition to other beatings.  There are some bloody images not exceptionally graphic.  There are implied sexual situations along with sexual innuendo.  There is also is profanity not especially strong or explicit, smoking and marijuana use.  I'm not too sure I could this an intellectual thriller, but it does make you think in some ways, it's entertaining and even initially intruiging at times.  I should also warn you that this is a reasonably disturbing movie, some of the images are pretty displeasing.  It's a bit dark and gloomy but a fine film and worth viewing in theatres.  Not a bad pick for owning on Video or DVD and would definetly make a good rental.</p></body></html>

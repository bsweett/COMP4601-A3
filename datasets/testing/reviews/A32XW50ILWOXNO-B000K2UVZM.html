"The Black Dahlia" is a disaster of campy melodrama and grim exploitation and a collision of competing genres, performances and moods, all fueled by director Brian DePalma's goofy peccadilloes and obsessions. It's like huffing angel dust while unmanned blimps crash into Lake Huron. Just wait until the scene at the lesbian cabaret.<br /><br />DePalma ("Scarface, "The Untouchables") and screenwriter Josh Friedman ("War Of The Worlds") adapt the James Ellroy novel that established him as this generation's Raymond Chandler. Ellroy retold the 1947 Los Angeles murder of Elizabeth Ann Short, an aspiring actress cut in half and disemboweled, a clown's smile carved in her mouth. The papers named Short "Black Dahlia" for her habit of walking up and down Sunset Boulevard in mourning clothes. The case remains unsolved.<br /><br />The book and movie "close" it through the work of two detectives - controlled Bucky (Josh Hartnett), and more volatile Lee (Aaron Eckhart) - a couple of ex-boxers of average investigative skills (and poorer ethics) who more or less stumble into a bizarre conspiracy beyond their pay grade. They also share a strange, mostly-platonic relationship Kay Lake (Scarlett Johannson) who cooks them big dinners, uses a cigarette holder and has the letters of a gangster carved into her back.<br /><br />Where do we start with this deranged bit of cinema? How about here: The casting stinks. Eckhart's too manic as the terse Lee, while Hartnett's is his usual study in out-of-depth confusion. And Ms. Scarlett? Crash. Burn. Cringe.<br /><br />At 21, she's far too young - Kim Basinger was 43 when for her Oscar-winning role in the adaptation of Ellroy's "LA Confidential" - and too tongue-tied for the rat-a-tat dialogue of film noirs. Worst, she is saddled with DePalma's habit of casting blonde women as sex idols, like when Johannson straddles the toilet in an open nightgown, wordlessly challenging Bucky to bolt up the stairs and take her. He shakes his head, and she slams the door, her loins denied.<br /><br />It gets steamier! DePalma's take on post-war lesbianism is a raucous piano bar of kissing-girl chorus lines and k.d. lang crooning "Time For Love." The camera swoops about as Bucky casually asks if anybody ever knew the disemboweled girl. Into this absurdity walks Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), a socialite who bills herself as a Dahlia lookalike. Bucky sure thinks so. The last half of the movie settles in with Madeline and her certifiable family. They know where the bodies are buried and who put them there.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" is probably at its craziest, and maybe its best, in these scenes. The Linscott clan unravels while Madeline tries to balance her repulsion with psychotic loyalty. Swank doesn't resemble the real Dahlia, or Mia Kirshner, who plays her in the movie. But with the Hepburn accent and theatrical eyes,  she seems to be the only lead actor in on DePalma's joke.<br /><br />The final act is faithful to Ellroy's novel, but it seems far more ridiculous here, because of the movie's already scattershot plot and endlessly shifting moods.<br /><br />Elizabeth Short is only seen through screen tests and a stag film, but Kirshner makes a tragic impression as a street urchin so hungry for stardom - for anything - that she's beautiful in her self-delusions. A couple scenes later, Bucky and Kay are pushing aside a Cornish game hen to make it on the dining table. We see Elizabeth humiliated in the porno. Then Bucky's striding over to Madeline's for a romp.<br /><br />There's so much insipid, unbridled passion between Bucky, Kay and Madeline that you sense DePalma's mocking it - the last scene scoffs at the idea of a truly happy ending - but these jabs at convention are thrown on top of a novel lurid enough for three movies. "The Black Dahlia" boldly goes, and goes, and goes. And go-go-go-goes.  It's the freakiest duckling of the year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Misleading "L.A. Confidential" Retread"></head><body><p>I'm used to convoluted and cluttered storylines in Brian DePalma films.  Take another look at "Femme Fatale" to see what I mean.  An entire diamond hiest appears to revolve around two hot chicks making it in a toilet stall during a film premiere--and that's the part that's easiest to follow.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" was supposed to be about the grotesque butchering of Elizabeth Short in 1940's L.A.  I mean, that is the title.  And the poster artwork.  And the trailers.<br /><br />But the Black Dahlia appears late in the movie--after a boxing match between rival buddies and scenes ripped off from "L.A. Confidential"--and barely becomes the focus until the wordy and unconvincing finale.  In fact, the discovery of her body takes place in the background of the movie that's well under way when she's found.<br /><br />I watched the extras and was surprised to see an interview with the screenwriter who adapted the original novel where he admits to showing an early draft of the script to friends--and they said there wasn't enough about the Dahlia in it!  So he rewrote it and added the screen test scenes.  That must mean that the Dahlia wasn't in the script at all before shooting began!<br /><br />The interview with the novelist also reveals that he piled everything about L.A. in the 1940's into his story...and it shows.<br /><br />The movie has interesting visual moments and the cast tries hard but it feels like it's all over the place.</p></body></html>

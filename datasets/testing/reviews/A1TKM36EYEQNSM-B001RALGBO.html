The Day After Tomorrow has suspense throughout the movie and you keep with the story throughout.<p>What peaked my curiosity about this movie, besides the fact that I like Sci-Fi and I am from NYC originally is that I heard just a few weeks ago that recently a large amount of fresh water was released into the northern Atlantic Ocean due to the melt on top of a glacier that released an iceburg.  <p>What appealed to me so much that the story goes that too much fresh water can actually slow down the process of the flow of warm to cold water and back in the Atlantic leading to colder weather eventually.<p>This movie is a lot better than the critics make it out to be, and to be sure there is an environmentalist message in it, yet, it does strike one as a serious attempt to tell a story and to get a message across.<p>The plot is excellent and the movie moves very quickly.  Unlike some disaster movies, this one is rather suspenseful throughout.  I was impressed at how fast the time goes while watching this longer than normal movie.<p>I felt cold after the movie was out, I guess it gave me a chill.  Interesting that it has been released at the beginning of the summer.  <p>The scene of the devastation of Los Angeles was horrific.  NYC being covered by water and snow?  Well, you really sense the devastation in the movie.  The trailers on a smaller screen do not do the movie justice.  It really looks like midtown Manhattan.  Wow, they did a good job here.<p>The development of the characters was very quick and Quaid does a credible job as a dad who has a promise to keep with his son.  Sela Ward does a great job as a working mom who has responsibility and lives up to it.  You really think that Jake Gyllenhaal is a very smart person and Emmy Rossum does a good job as his very smart teammate. <p>The casting and storyline worked very well together.  The Day After Tomorrow is a worthwhile flick.  I look forward to the DVD with the trailers and how it was made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Comedy With The Usual Hollywood Flaws!  Wilson & Vaughn Shine!"></head><body><p>After watching Wedding Crashers you'll realize that if you're into slightly-off-kilter comedies involving sex and sarcasm then you'll have enjoyed yourself and laughed continuously.  If you're not into those kind of movies, steer clear.  Juvenille and drop-dead funny in spots, Wedding Crashers biggest flaw is that it plays right into the typical Hollywood formula of comedy.  Two best friends crash weddings to score with chicks.  They have flash and panache and usually a killer back-story.  They are chick magnets.  Feeling saucy they decide to crash the wedding of the daughter of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken.  Ballsy.  Well...one of them (Owen Wilson)falls for the Secretary's sweet daughter Claire while the other (Vince Vaughn) hits it off with the stage-5 clinger/psycho/nymphomaniac other daughter. Push comes to shove and the two of them end up at the Secretary's shore estate for the weekend.  Owen Wilson has all the charm-jets fired up as Vaughn plays the fall guy.  Overall, one very funny movie.  You try to overlook the cliche storyline.  The great, pure, kind girl with the evil, sadistic boyfriend with the nice guy trying to intervene scenario.  (See Wedding Singer and about a million other movies...) Classic and tacky and filled with raucous hilarity.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

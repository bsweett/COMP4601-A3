<meta name="summary" content="'The Prestige' review"></head><body><p>Vengeance and magic becomes bound together when one magician blames another for the drowning death of his wife in a trick gone bad. The two men set out to ruin one another's careers, but they only wound themselves deeper with each cut of vengeance they make. The tale is mystifying, but also has an emotional depth as each magician deals with great loss. The plot twists are excellent!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

Beyond the greatest actress of our time, everything else is absolutely brilliant about this remarkable film following the hours in three women's lives in different decades, each with similiar and compelling problems.  Nicole Kidman is perfect as Virginia Wolfe, the depressed writer dealing with a life that is stifling her, a world that she desperately wants to escape.  Julianne Moore is superb again (also giving another great performance in "Far From Heaven") as a 50s house wife that is also living in a life that she can't bare living.  Meryl plays the modern gal, rounding out the trio and all three are drawn together in some way by the book Virginia is writing called "Mrs. Dalloway".  Both Moore and Kidman received Oscar nominations for their roles and its a disappointment that Meryl didn't receive one as well.  But nonetheless, the entire film is beautifully directed and acted.  Ed Harris does an incredible job as a good friend and former lover of Streep's character.  This is the kind of film that makes you realize how important and artistic the media  of movie making is.  Make time and see this film.  You won't regret spending a few hours with these three incredible women.</p></body></html>

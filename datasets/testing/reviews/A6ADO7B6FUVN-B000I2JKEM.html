<meta name="summary" content="A Thoughtfully Dark Love Story by Burton..."></head><body><p>In the murkiest night the darkness wraps its shadowy blanket over all that is exposed.  Such a night is a fitting moment for the glum tale of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, which has its roots in Russian-Jewish folklore.  The actual tale called The Finger received a loose adaptation by the three screenwriters John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson, as they made some changes while preserving the strongest themes of the 19th century folktale.  Yet, the screenwriters delicately maintain the ominous atmosphere, which the two directors magically brought to life through groundbreaking stop-motion photography using, for the first time ever, a digital camera.  Despite the story's morose and macabre content, it is an event for young and old, as it allows the audience to experience a dark, yet wonderfully poignant tale of love.<br /><br />The audience finds Corpse Bride situated in a time when rigid Victorian morality governs the upper class through strict control of emotions and low tolerance for any kind of overt behavior.  In many aspects, these strict societal rules almost prevent a person to live life, as the only proper thing was to completely suffocate the inner feelings such as love.  Strong Christian values govern the people and if over-stepping the social norms the consequences could be social rejection, which people of high status feared most of all.  However, there is also a double standard emerging in the film, as greed leads people on to seek fortune and status by all means necessary.<br /><br />In the opening scene Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp's voice) draws a live butterfly and then releases it into the open through the window.  Secretively, it shows the Victor values feelings and the moments of blissful joy, as the camera follows the butterfly through a montage displaying people's obsessions in life.  The first thing that comes into view is a number of clocks, all being exactly on time, as a man stands sweeping in unison with time.  It lets the mind ponder the monotony of life that many might suffer when becoming fixated with time.  Next we get to see people chopping the heads of fishes, which presents an interesting analogy to the Victorian time.  Fish is a symbol for life and fertility while here it is being completely decapitated.  In addition, the fishmongers do not seem to enjoy what they are doing, as they mechanically toss fish up in the cutting board, which again supports the notion of meaningless existence.  The opening montage sets the mood for the rest of the film, which is dark, ominous, and almost ill.<br /><br />Swiftly the story hurries along, as the opening montage introduces all the main characters.  Soon the audience learns that there is to be an arranged marriage between the rich fishmonger family Van Dort and the soon-to-be destitute aristocrat family Everglot (family name sounds like a word play with gluttony.)  Victor is extremely nervous to meet his bride to be Victoria (Emily Watson's voice), as both are concerned whether they will love each other.  However, both sets of parents brush the notion of love away, as both families see an opportunity to gain either fortune, or social prestige of a title.<br /><br />When Victor and Victoria meet each other for the first time all thoughts of worry in regards to whether they will love one another disappear, as Cupid's arrows simultaneously burrow itself into their chests.  Yet, the strong societal rules forbid them to express their emotions for each other.  Instead, Victor displays his newly acquired emotions for Victoria by stumbling on the words when rehearsing the wedding ceremony.  His clumsiness becomes paramount to the level that the priest suspends the wedding until Victor can remember the wedding vows.  In despair, Victor stumbles out Everglot's mansion of the repeating, stumbling, and stuttering the vows, until he finally gets them right and places the ring on what looks like a twig.  However, it is the bony remains of a corpse who awakens when Victor places the ring on her finger.  The voice of Helena Bonham Carter presents the corpse bride that Victor married by mistake.  Meanwhile, the malevolently sly Lord Barkis (Richard E. Grant's voice) sees an opportunity to seize Victoria, as his own bride.<br /><br />It is a mesmerizing journey to follow Victor and his predicament of having married a dead woman while also trying to get back to the land of the living.  During Victor's stay in the Underworld an interesting notion emerges that one should cherish the moments of love and warm feelings while alive.  However, the strict moral codes by which the people live prohibits the people from fully discovering the true wonders of life such a love.  The Corpse Bride is not Burton's best, but it is a remarkable tale with an important message that will both entertain and keep the audience contemplating several issues including the importance of love.</p></body></html>

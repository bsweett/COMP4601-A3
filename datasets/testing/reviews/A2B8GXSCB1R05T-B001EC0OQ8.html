If you can do that, you are in for a treat. <p>This if Film Noir at it's finest.? All the dames are dangerously beautiful, and all the detectives are hard-boiled.?? Never, ever trust the Fat Man or anyone named Joel Cairo.??? Tense, moody and harsh are all adjectives that describe this film.? The dialog is as sharp and as clever as Jane Austin.? "The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter." The ending scene is one of cinema's greatest. You just can't go wrong with a true classic of this caliber.<p>The DVD is great.? The black and white is crisp and clear, and completely essential to the mood of the flick.? Why anyone ever colorized the Maltese Falcon is beyond me, but here it is completely restored. The extra feature, "Becoming Attractions," is very interesting. It examines the Hollywood selling of Humphrey Bogart from background "heavy" to leading man.</p></body></html>

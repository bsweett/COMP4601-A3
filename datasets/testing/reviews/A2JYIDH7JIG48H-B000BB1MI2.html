<meta name="summary" content="Good ending, but wheres The Candy Man?"></head><body><p>As I was watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, it occurred to me that this review would basically conclude that this version of the movie adds absolutely nothing to the old version, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder and Jack Albertson.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the plot, Willy Wonka runs a Chocolate Factory, but no one has been allowed inside with him for years.  He distributes 5 golden tickets randomly in shipments of chocolate bars.  The children who find the tickets will win a tour of the factory.  Young charlie is one of the lucky kids, from a very poor home, who finds a golden ticket.  The tour commences and the kids - each with one adult family member - see strange and wondrous things inside the candy factory.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is probably the best actor available for the role, almost ideal, some would say - but not better, for this particular role of Willy Wonka, than Wilder.  Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers of movie scores, especially Tim Burton movies, but in this case his music is actually worse than in the old film.  And the dancing rock numbers of the Oompa Loompa's is horrendous.  The old film was in color, had decent art direction and special effects, fine acting, and both films follow essentially the same plot, with minor variations, not much funnier in the new film.  Plus they left out the "Candy Man" song, one of my favorite parts of the old version. And so I would have given the film only 3 stars, for it's almost as good as the original, though unnecessary since it's not better, and then one less star because I missed "The Candy Man."<br /><br />But then the end came, and then they DID add more in this version, and it's good - morally and emotionally satisfying - and it involves Christopher Lee.  So I'm giving it 4 stars and recommend it for the whole family and everybody.  And the old version as well.</p></body></html>

Each one of these 11 bad people have their own story to tell, and you, the viewer, will get to see their lives and personalities unfold before they die.  They will die by being shot, exploded by bombs, or maybe stabbed.  Pick yourself up off the chair you're sitting on right now and drive to the movie store and rent this movie.</p></body></html>

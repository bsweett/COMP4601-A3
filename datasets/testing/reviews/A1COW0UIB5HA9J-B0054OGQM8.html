The sequels were filmed back-to-back as they continued on Marty Mcfly's adventures as part 2 was weak but good while part 3 was an improvement but nowhere as great as the original movie, they all have great acting, brilliant concepts and ideas and fantastic special effects that makes these movies such Sci-fi favorites.<br /><br />The DVD boxset has terrific picture and sound quality with great extras like audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, live Q & A session, outtakes, publicity and more.

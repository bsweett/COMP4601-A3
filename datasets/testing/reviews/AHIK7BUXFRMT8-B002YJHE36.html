<meta name="summary" content="Good Action Movie with a Surprise Twist"></head><body><p>I had not read the book and approached the movie with no preconceived notions about it; I just wanted to watch it and see what it was all about and if it was worth the time. My verdict is it was definitely worth the time and provided continuous action that kept my attention all the way to an ending that was a total surprise.<br /><br />If you are an action movie fan this one should not disappoint you; there was always something happening with plenty of unexpected developments that keeps one guessing what will happen next.<br /><br />I recommend the movie and found it thoroughly entertaining. If you can just go with the flow you should find it an enjoyable ride.</p></body></html>

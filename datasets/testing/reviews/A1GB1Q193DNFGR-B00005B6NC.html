<meta name="summary" content="Clever Science Fiction With Serious Bite and Complexity"></head><body><p>Director David N. Twothy (the Arrival) has undoubtedly surpassed my wildest expectations with this devilishly clever and well polished Science Fiction thriller that resonates with immensely amusing dialogue, sparkles with highly believable characters, reverberates with noteworthy performances from Radha Mitchell (Fry), Cole Hauser (Johns), and the incomparable Van Disel in a star making performance as the irrepressible career criminal Riddick, and ingeniously experiments and rearranges classic SCI/FI formulas and conventions ranging from Alien, Aliens, Terminator, and Star Trek with subtle filmmaking rarities like plot and character development to conceive a Sci-Fi epic that has volatile mix of sophisticated horror, highly modulated thrills and chills, and a uniquely human dimension that is sorely lacking in its peers.<p>Pitch Black is much deserved respite from the average Sci-Fi onslaught of just recycled story pictures, monster slasher flicks, inane clones and formula hybrids, and technology driven effects pictures with essentially nothing more to provide than it's sophisticated effects. Though Pitch Black contains it's lion share of new age special effects and sounds, Pitch Black instead uses the wildly advanced film-making faculties as icing on top of a well defined story rather than the other way around. <p>Thankfully, Pitch Black comes packaged with an entire brigade of options ranging from a David  N. Twothy commentary track, a making-of Documentary, theatrical trailers, a three-extra minute exclusive un-rated version of the film, a marketing video on the selling of Pitch Black, and more. A Must-Buy for any fan of superior science fiction.<p>P.S. Certainly has the most charismatic villain since the Terminator.</p></body></html>

Jackson's character getting into a car accident in the middle of a busy, fast-moving freeway. Ben is a lawyer and he's late for a court hearing, meanwhile Samuel has a court hearing himself relating to important matters concerning his family life.<br /><br />They don't exactly end up in the same courtroom however, since I'm sure you're probably believing that's where it's going. Nope!<br /><br />Well, Ben's character being young and impatient, basically says "I'm late for work, goodbye!" after the accident takes place, leaving Samuel's character confused and really angry. Well Ben happens to leave an important file in the possession of Samuel L. Jackson, so Samuel eventually uses that file to get his revenge and make Ben's life a living nightmare after the two of them fail to negotiate in a proper, adult manner.<br /><br />My only gripe with the storyline is that, well for one thing the ending is melodramatic and unmemorable (though to be fair, perhaps the writers were going for something different from the norm, which is a respectable move I suppose).<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the actual nightmare scenarios Samuel puts Ben through isn't NEARLY as intense or as exciting as you're probably hoping for, especially if you've ever watched Samuel's frightening performance in Lakeview Terrace. The same can be said for Ben's revenge against Samuel. Basically the storyline is that Ben and Samuel keep going back and forth at each other trying to one-up the other person in terms of being aggressive and vengeful.<br /><br />But again... the ending. It should have been better. Alright alright, I don't really care about the ending. It was different. Besides that, it's worth your time.</p></body></html>

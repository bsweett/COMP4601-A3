When Lisa goes on a over night flight to her home in Miami Florida she meets a stranger that ends up being her seatmate on the flight.... She then finds out that she is part of a plot to kill a candiate..... Both Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy deliver in this thriller and i would have to say that the storyline was great and pretty much this is a must have thriller for any movie collector!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

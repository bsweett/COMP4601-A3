Their onscreen chemistry is palpable and, jaded old movie watcher that I am, I found myself instantly accepting the bond that Phoenix and Witherspoon portray together. Surprisingly, the vocals are all theirs, too (thankfully! with a vocal style as distinctive and unmistakable as that of Johnny Cash, it would have been stupid to attempt to lip-synch, in my opinion), and here more praise must be heaped on the pair - not only can they sing these songs, they perform them with real spirit and energy.<br /><br />Another cast highlight is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash, giving an excellent performance as the nasty daddy - perhaps the only flaw of the movie's script is that it does not allow for much development of characters like Ray Cash or Vivian - but Patrick and Ginnifer Goodwin, insofar as they're able, don't allow their small parts to become two-dimensional, so it's not all bad news.<br /><br />Direction is great - James Mangold displays a real sense of affinity with the music hall style of C&W performance and, as with the rest of the picture, this comes across as a believable, plausible style. Musical numbers are kept nicely and wisely understated and the whole look and feel of the movie is very pared-back, but all the more rewarding because of this.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent character study: two amazing performances from the leads mean that a simplistic plot of boy-meets-girl-and-must-overcome-personal-demons-in-order-to-get-girl is showcased in a beautiful, satisfying and very real way.<br /><br />Wholly recommended. And I just went and bough my first ever Johnny Cash album, too!</p></body></html>

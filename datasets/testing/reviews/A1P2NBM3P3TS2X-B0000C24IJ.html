<meta name="summary" content="Reasonably well made old-style thriller"></head><body><p>No new ground is broken in this horror thriller, but the film is shot rather beautifully with Toronto and its surroundings doubling for West Virginia.  <p>Eliza Dushku and some other impossibly good-looking cast members are stranded and then hunted down by a trio of inbred mountain men.  Standard horror film format then ensues.  <p>The film runs a little under 80 minutes (not including end credits) so it at least benefits from somewhat tight pacing.  <p>Make-up whiz and creature creator Stan Winston is a producer on this film, and much of the Electronic Press Kit info (passed off on the DVD as "bonus featurettes") features Stan the Man fawning over his make-up designs for the hillbilly inbred mountain men.  "I wanted them to look more like real people than horror creatures", he says.  Sorry, Stan.  You swung and missed on that one.  They look a little TOO creature-y and not enough like real people.  You took the facial and body disfigurations just a little too far.  One of them just looks like an evil elf.<p>Ironically enough, not enough attention is paid to these murdering, cannibalistic mountain men.  We get only a few teasing glimpses at what they do (or intend to do) with their victims.  The film really only fun and creepy when we (and our hapless heroes) are getting a look at the mountain trio's handywork.  Shades of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", 1974 version.  <p>The director says in the lackluster commentary that he wanted this film to be like a cross between "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Deliverance".  To some degree he succeeds, but everything that made the hillbilly rednecks in "Deliverance" so shiveringly believable, namely that they could pass for "ordinary" but were in fact brutal and scary, is covered up in "Wrong Turn" with so much make-up and prosthetics that the villains look too "Hollywood".  The make-up draws too much attention to itself.<p>All that aside, the film is a decent rental though probably not one to purchase for the home library.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fast and kinetic thriller !"></head><body><p>The first film that overtly had to do with the remembrances of a secret service agent trying for keeping alive the life of a President was "In the line of fire".<br /><br />Nevertheless, this movie experiences a sensible twist of fate, when precisely there's a love affair between the President's wife and one of the best agents (Michael Douglas), who likes to seduce wives of married men. As a matter of fact he was involved into a painful incident with a colleague ten years ago (Kiefer Sutherland). But soon the things will change for hi, when a sinister plan in order to kill the President begins to appear.<br /><br />The rhythmic vitality of the film, the unbearable dramatic tension, the stunning cast, the formidable direction, the splendid photograph  and the solid edition, make of this thriller a must-see.<br /><br />A winner!</p></body></html>

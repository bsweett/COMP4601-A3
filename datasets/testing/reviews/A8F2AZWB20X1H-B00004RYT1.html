<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock at his absolute best"></head><body><p>This is the movie that set the standard for horror films and makes most of them pale in comparison.  Hitchcock set out to make his audience scream and succeeded beyond his wildest expectations; I saw &quot;Psycho&quot; when it was first released and the screams almost lifted the roof off the theater.  Filming the movie in black and white was a stroke of genius; the spooky  impact would have been much diminished if it had been shot in color.  And  Lord, that music... Bernard Herrmann's score helped make &quot;Psycho&quot;  the total horror ride it is, screechy violins and all.  The cast is  excellent throughout.  Anthony Perkins is, and always will be, Norman  Bates.  Janet Leigh is terrific as Marian Crane, John Gavin and Vera Miles  give great performances as her boyfriend and her sister, and Martin Balsam  is wonderful as the cynical private eye Arbogast, who makes one trip too  many to the Bates Motel.  Hitchcock knows how to frame his shots; the scene  of Vera Miles descending the cellar stairs and finding Mrs. Bates is a  heart-stopper no matter how many times you watch it.  With Norman Bates,  Hitchcock added an unforgettable figure to the horror pantheon, and this  movie will surely live as one of the great horror classics of all time.  They just don't make 'em like this any more.</p></body></html>

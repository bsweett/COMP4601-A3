Walt Disney's first full animated feature film its an artistic masterful achievement. The film was a great triumph in 1937 and is still a great triumph today, nearly 73 years after. Aside from being the first animated film and the one that paved the way to the creation of the Disney empire as we know it today with dozens of many animated films in its catalogue most of them redeemed as classics today, Snow White happens to be a fantastic film. It has a great plot, a great story with great characters, music and heart. This makes this film as fresh as it was in its original theatrical release so many years ago. Disney has always treated this masterpiece as such and in 2001 it was release as a 2-Disc Platinum edition DVD. This DVD was the best of the Platinum line and one of the best DVDs ever produced. Disney again does the film justice releasing it now as part of the Diamond line in Bluray and the results are better than ever.<br /><br />Snow white looks fantastic in hi def with vivid colors, sharpness and a clean transfer. The Platinum looked terrific but Disney topped themselves with this new transfer. Absolutely marvelous. The DTS MA 7.1 is also very crisp and clear but don't expect it to rock your house. Nonetheless, is a great audio. Purists will be glad that the original mono track has been also restored and included here.<br /><br />The Platinum Edition was a pioneer for the vast content that had about the movie., This Diamond edition does the same in a more interactive way that inmerse you much more in the world of Snow White. The Hyperion Studios feature is fantastic.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can count is that not everything from the Platinum Edition has been carried over to the Diamond. If you(like me) are an avid fan of Snow White, you should hold onto both because together they make the ultimate deluxe edition of this film. The DVD that is included here also looks fantastic and better than the Platinum. A 5.1 DEHTM is also included.<br /><br />As you can see, this diamond edition of Snow White is deluxe treatment for a deluxe film. While is unfortunate that not everything from the Platinum got place here, this new edition is oustanding nonetheless. Just Buy it. Completely Recommended.<br /><br />Note: This film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 fullscreen which is the right aspect ratio of the film. Viewers who want a widescreen experience can watch the film with Disneyview that fills the black bars with backgrounds similar to the ones in the film.</p></body></html>

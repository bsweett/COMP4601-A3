<meta name="summary" content="Excellent remake, Streep steals it!"></head><body><p>This film delivered on all fronts. Suspense, acting, tight direction...another feather in Demme's cap!<br /><br />Washington is great, as usual...but it is Meryl Streep as the ballsy Senator that really steals this show (as usual)! Every scene she was in brightened and you coudl tell she really had a blast chewing the scenery. Hopefully she'll get an oscar nom for this one.</p></body></html>

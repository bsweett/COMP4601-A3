<meta name="summary" content="I Could Even Watch it Again"></head><body><p>If watching a film over and over again is any indication of a great story, this one merits such praise.<br /><br />Always playing a quintessential American, he repeats such a performance here as a recently widowed retiree and Korean war veteran who resents the HMong Asians that are taking over his neighborhood. His well-kept home and mannicured lawn adorned with an American flag represent his values, and stands as a beacon in a neighborhood that is being overcome by neglect and overrun by gangs. Wanting to be left alone, his contempt for customs, dress and language of his neighbors is palpable in word and facial expression. He shares almost as much contempt for his neglectful sons, and his granddaughter whom he despises for her dress and lack of manners.<br /><br />A strange relationship develops when he finds out one of his neighbors attempted to steal his pristine, 1972, Gran Torino that he helped build in his assemly line career at Ford Motor Company. The boy's mother insists he make restitution for the family's honor. The man who just wants to be left alone is drawn to the would-be thief and the family he disdains. We see him as a curmudgeon who pays them compliments with insults such as "I could use some good gook food," when invited for dinner. In fact his character, Walt Kowalski uses all of them under the Sun (Yat Sen).  Yet, their respect for such a disrespectful man grows, as he takes the boy under his wing and becomes the protector of the rest of his family.<br /><br />This is where Eastwood's performance soars. He appears to be in constant conflict with his prejudice against his sense of justice and fair play. He goes over the edge when one of the family members suffers at the hands of a local gang. Justice must be served and sacrifices must be made. Their mutual devotion replaces the lack of the same with his own family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has delivered such memorable characters as Dirty Harry and Josie Wales with great lines such as, "Go ahead; make my day" and "Dyin's not much of a livin'." Like a good wine or scotch improves with age, Eastwood becomes equally memorable as a director. When he directs and acts, it is topnotch entertainment from a very simple story of a complicated human being. His supporting cast is also superb, and this film may launch future careers to prominence. The score, if you can call it that, is mellow and almost haunting.<br /><br />There is not a dull moment in this film in what starts off as a seemingly bland plot. With a penchant for a wandering mind for average stories, I was not only transfixed watching it, but watched it two more times to pick up nuance I might have missed. I was never bored.<br /><br />I don't think you will be bored either. Order it here, or drive to your nearest outlet to rent or buy it, even if you don't have a 1972 Gran Torino to get there.</p></body></html>

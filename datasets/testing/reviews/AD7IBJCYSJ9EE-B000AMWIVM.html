My newspaper gave it the "bomb" rating.<br /><br /> The movie's about this killer kidnapping people and making them play 99% impossible puzzles. When a guy named Adam and a doctor get kidnapped, they need to solve the mystery.<br /><br /> This movie is gory, disturbing, and just plain fun. Lots of plot twists that will make you keep guessing! Bring on Saw 2!</p></body></html>

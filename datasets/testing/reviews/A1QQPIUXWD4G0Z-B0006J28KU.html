<meta name="summary" content="The Best Bank Heist Film Ever Made"></head><body><p>Director Michael Mann's 1995 film is certainly the best bank caper movie ever made. In addition to having great character studies of both the criminals (De Niro, Sizemore, Kilmer), it also studies those of the cops (Pacino.) Without a doubt, this movie has one of the best shootout scenes I have ever seen in any movie besides a war film.<br /><br />Impeccable acting on the part of De Niro, who's looking to do one last heist before quitting the game. Although Pacino also delivers a powerful performance as the cop, I found it to be more of the same hysterics as in virtually all of his other roles (i.e. Scarface, Scent of a Woman, etc.) Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd also delivered a great performance.<br /><br />A very entertaining film with the right balance of drama and action to keep you on the edge of your seats. Definitely the crown of all bank heist films.</p></body></html>

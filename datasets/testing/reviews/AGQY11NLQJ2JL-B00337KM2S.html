Ryan gets comfort from the routine he sets his life to and the way he convinces himself that he is fulfilled, until he meets Natalie.  Natalie is a motivated young lady who is trying to reduce the cost of sending people like Ryan to fire employees. Once Ryan's job is threatened by Natalie's idea, he agrees on taking her with him on a trip to show her how important his job is.<br /><br />The story might sound very simple and plain, but on their way, Ryan and Natalie develop a friendship that will change the way they see life and relationships. Both friends find out that their priorities are seriously flawed.  With a new perspective, that is less deceptive and delusional, both friends discover deeper aspects of life.<br /><br />With reflections on the meaning of love, family, and the importance of one's job, this movie is much deeper than you might think. This is one of the best movies of the year!</p></body></html>

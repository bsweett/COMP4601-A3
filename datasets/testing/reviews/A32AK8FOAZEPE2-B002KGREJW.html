<meta name="summary" content="not bad, but not great either"></head><body><p>a typical dramatized american struggling family, not even qualified as a middle class clan, got to squeeze everyway to get by since there was no steady income at all. simply put, a house poor family, every body got some demon or agenda to deal with. the only thing i felt so contrite and unnatural is why put another gay guy in the movie again? for those who like to chase or follow their (broken) dreams no matter what, this might be the movie for you. it's so typically boring. what about later? the 'thereafter'? happily thereafter? definitely not. might still have to eat fried chicken everyday as the main course, some sweets as the dessert 24/7. the struggle never goes away.</p></body></html>

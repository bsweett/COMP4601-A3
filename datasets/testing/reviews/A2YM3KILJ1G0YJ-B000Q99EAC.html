<meta name="summary" content="What Rocky V should have been"></head><body><p>Sylvester Stallone makes his way back to the Rocky series to redeem himself after the travesty that was Rocky 5.<br /><br />It's a swan song movie, more touching and slow-moving drama than the rest, but it still packs a punch.<br /><br />The movie starts with Rocky several years after his boxing career has ended. He's living alone as a result of his wife's passing, and he uses his daily hours taking care of the needs of his restaurant, named in honor of his late wife. For Rocky, however, just getting by is not enough, just going through life is not enough. The fire still burns within.<br /><br />He slowly lets the news leak out to his son and Paulie that he'd like to fight again. Neither seems to receptive. Hell, even the Boxing Commission is against it. But then a computer generated fight in which Rocky KOs the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (played by real boxer Antonio Tarver), gets the wheels in motion for Rocky 5 (take two).<br /><br />It's a joke of a fight, nobody expects Rocky to have a chance. Everyone is counting him out, even his family. Rocky still believes, and he proves his point, and his life's motto, by telling his son that life is not about how hard one can hit; but, instead, it's about how hard one can be hit, and keep moving forward.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is a bit slow, building up the drama and tension. Eventually, however, the training montage takes place, and the actual fight ensues.<br /><br />It ends exactly as the Rocky series should end: in the ring, with power, with dignity, and with a ton of body shots.</p></body></html>

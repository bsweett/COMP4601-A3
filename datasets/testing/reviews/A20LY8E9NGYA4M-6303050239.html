<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE TWO BEST WESTERNS OF ALL TIME."></head><body><p>The other one is "Once Upon A Time In The West", also directed by Sergio Leone. As in some of the best Spaghetti Western movies, in "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" there are no heroes, only antiheroes at best, all the characters are capable of anything in order to remain alive.<p>Ennio Morricone's score is another character in this epic set in a Western, the main theme is one of the most well-known songs in the world of the music from the movies. The photography is flawless, as well as Sergio Leone's direction. The characters are so fascinating that the audiences are interested in them from beginning to end.<p>"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is one of the two best westerns, both this movie and "Once Upon A Time In The West" are essential videos, both films made by Sergio Leone.</p></body></html>

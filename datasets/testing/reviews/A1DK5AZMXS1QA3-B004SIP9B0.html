Examples included "Elizabeth", "Shakespeare in Love", "Braveheart", and now "The Queen".  The last takes place in the present, the 1990's specifically, and chronicles the personal experience of the royal family after the death of Diana.  The story is told from multiple points of view, with the Queen and Tony Blair being the two main protagonists.  He is in touch with the British people; she is not.  She is in touch with England's past, they are not.  She feels the best way to get past Diana's death is in private; the public want a public ceremony.  So opposites collide and as a sign of a modern country, the monarch gives way to the people's will.  As an American, I found this to be quite an insightful movie, in that it very realistically portrays how a real person in power relates to the masses as part of a real historical event.  Few movies exist that do the same for American leaders; the last great one was probably "Nixon" by Oliver Stone.  Though all dialogue, this was a captivating movie, and worth the two hours to watch it.</p></body></html>

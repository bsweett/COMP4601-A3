<meta name="summary" content="Get Through the First Half"></head><body><p>There's a temptation to say that I thought this movie was a little overrated.<br /><br />The movie is either going to connect with you or it isn't.  I was pleased that I finally saw it.  A friend of mine is planning a wine-tasting trip to everywhere the movie went (which are all real places, I believe--even the Hitching Post).<br /><br />The cast is outstanding.  The production is top-notch.  But it takes a while to get going.  I don't know if it needed all that set-up to get the characters going but I stuck it out through a dry opening.  Miles, the Paul Giammatti character, nearly loses me right off the bat.  Okay, he's a frustrated writer who isn't going anywhere (I just watched WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and that was about TWO frustrated writer/teachers who didn't go anywhere).  Fine.  But when he steals money from his mother...how do you get "lovable loser" back after that?  Misstep or really revealing character flaw?  That's up to each viewer.<br /><br />His hopeless behavior with women and then adding alcohol to unleash darker rages didn't help either.  He is such a loser by the midpoint that, instead of seeing him pull it together and win the girl or whatever happy ending you want to tag on this, I wanted to see him pay for his boorish behavior to everyone.<br /><br />Thankfully, Thomas Haden Church is on hand to goose this movie to life.  His wild, reckless needs give an unpredictable energy to everything.  You don't care so much about what Miles will do next, you wonder what his buddy will get into next!<br /><br />Some great, funny scenes in the second half.  Really slow first half.  If you can read fast, turn the subtitles on and hit x2 on your fast forward until you get halfway through.</p></body></html>

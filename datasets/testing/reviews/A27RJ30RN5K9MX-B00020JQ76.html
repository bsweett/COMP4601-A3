<meta name="summary" content="So much better than expected..."></head><body><p>The film focuses on a bounty hunter named Beck ( WWE's The Rock)who works for a loan shark named Walker ( William Lucking). Beck longs to get out of the business and open up a restraunt. Walker agrees to release Beck of his obligations if he pulls one last job. That job consists of Beck traveling to Brazil to bring home Walker's son Travis ( Seann William Scott). Travis is currently trying to find a priceless and ancient artifact refered to as "The Gato" which is a solid piece of gold in the form of a cat. Beck assumes that it will be an easy job. However, when he gets to Brazil, Beck discovers a local slave driver/ gold prospector named Hatcher ( Christopher Walken) who needs Travis to lead him to The Gato. Now Beck must not only deal with Hatcher and his men, but Travis's repeated escape attempts as well.<p>Before I watched "The Rundown" I had some serious doubts. I have been a fan of the WWE for years, and I respect The Rock as a sports entertainer. But after seeing his last film "The Scorpion King" it became apparent that The Rock could not act his way out of a paper bag. However, after watching The Rundown, I was majorly suprised at how good this film turned out to be. It is incredibly similar to "Midnight Run" because it involves action, comedy, and aspects of a buddy flick. At times, this film is funnier than Midnight Run because it is set in the jungles of Brazil, and Beck and Travis must deal with crazy villagers, sex crazed monkeys, etc.. This provides for a lot of entertainment. The Rock actually did a very good job. He was smooth when he delivered his dialogue, he did very well in the fight scenes, and he brought aspects of his WWE character into the role with his skill for comedy and even a "rock bottom" in one of the fights. Seann William Scott also did a very good job and worked extremely well off of The Rock. Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson also did a nice job in their roles as well.<p>While "The Rundown" might not be the best movie ever made, it offers a solid mix of action and comedy, and turns into the best buddy flick that I have seen since "Midnight Run". The fight scenes were extremely well choreographed, and all of the actors did a nice job in their roles. This is definately a film that enforces the rule of " don't judge a book by its cover" because I went from thinking this film was going to stink, to buying it shortly after I watched it. The DVD itself brings excellent picture and sound quality, as well as some cool extras.<p>A solid 4 stars...</p></body></html>

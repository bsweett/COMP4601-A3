<meta name="summary" content="Zaney Movie, Unfortunate Ending"></head><body><p>I had no idea what to expect from "Little Miss Sunshine" but I knew that it was nominated for "Best Picture" so it must have had something going for it.  I caught on quickly that this is not your ordinary movie and I soon realized that anything could happen.  This is a story of a hopelessly dysfunctional family whose many seperate parts find a most unusal way of coming together.  You can see it coming and it really becomes rather impressive to watch.  However, this film disappointed me in how it ended.<br /><br />I was bothered by the portrayal of the phoney plastic young girls in the Little Miss Sunshine.  Let's face it, movies and TV stereotype just about everything. For some groups it has been a real issue.  However, when was the last time you saw a pageant portrayed as a number of young ladies striving to become the best that they could be with every participant exiting the event as a better person than when they started?  I've attended a lot of pageants over the years (thanks primarily because our town annually hosts the state's Miss America contest).  The reality of the quality of the participants has always impressed me as far exceeding the demeaning stereotype that permeants society's general impressions.  Maybe it's an overblown reation but it bothered me how the movie strayed from what I saw as a theme of how to become a success.  All of the film's  unusual family members had failed to achieve their goals except for our young and endearing heroine.  How the movie treated her moment on the stage really bothered me.  Otherwise, this is an enjoyable albeit unusual film.<br /><br />I guess I should acknowledge that the message of "Little Miss Sunshine" might possibly be that the problem with chasing our dreams is that they can turn into nightmares.  Be happy with what life allots you while laughing at those who haven't yet had their comeuppance.  This could have been such a better movie!  Oh well, I noticed that this was an independent film so perhaps they were poking fun at Hollywood's glamour girls with more looks than talent while the Indie actors were doing the heavy lifting.  See, none of this really scores any points.  Oh well, enjoy "Littler Miss Sunshine" for what it is rather than what it isn't.</p></body></html>

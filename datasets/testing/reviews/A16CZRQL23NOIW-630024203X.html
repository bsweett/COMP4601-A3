<meta name="summary" content="Don't bet with a peaceful man!"></head><body><p>This film seen under the serene gaze of more than twenty years is the expected reaction of so many frustrations, disillusions born under the bad sign of Vietnam. In those ages  the state of abandon and apathy in all the country had almost a quarter of century. From the Kennedy affair till the last eighties a chain of successive scandals,  politic corruption and internal affairs of any issue literally invaded every inch of ink of the principal headlines of the written press and other mediums.<br /><br />In this state of things, the depressed spirit was analyzed by the merchandisers and Rocky was the first punch to raise the self stem of the mass media. Songs as Born in the USA, for instance, made the same role. Then Rambo was born as a mythological figure. A hero born precisely from the ashes who lived the hell and become  a machine human war. And the rest is story. The film obviously sympathizes with John Rambo as the peaceful man who simply wants to forget his job and remake a new life, but the ancestral codes and the old fashioned mind of the law bureaucracy will raise the hidden demons.<br /><br />Despite the picture has aged, it's a fundamental piece in those turbulent ages and it worked out perfectly as cathartic device. Excellent action sequences.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Noir with taste of Greek tragedy!"></head><body><p>The great director Sidney Lumet reappears after a long rest, based on an impeccable and well zealous script to give us an approach of a well known thriller with taste of Greek tragedy .<br /><br />Two brothers Andy (the smart guy) and Hank (the black lamb) decide to robe a modest jewelry who belongs to their own mother. The original idea, according Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was nobody resulted wounded it's to say a clean heist. Meanwhile hank is the secret lover of Andy's wife and Hank decides to hire a junk to make the task, but as always nothing happens as in theory and after several shots both die.<br /><br />Since that moment the life of these brothers is a true messy hell; on the other hand their father is not only emotionally destroyed, but he seeks revenge for those who killed his beloved wife.<br /><br />As you may suppose all the members of the family are really trapped in a web of lies, betrayals and double crossing, due the normal desperation and the complex of guilty that hovers th3 conscious of these two brothers.<br /><br />All the cast is effective. Albert Finney once more, stands out as the father, Seymour Hoffman outstanding, Ethan Hawke is brilliant and the always beautiful and alluring Marisa Tomei shows us her deserved Academy Award in My uncle Vinnie was not a mere casualty. The fresh narrative style of Lumet making smart flash backs completes a well rounded film that meant an original thriller of unpredictable final and hair raising suspense.</p></body></html>

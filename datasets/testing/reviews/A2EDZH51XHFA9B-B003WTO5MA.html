The "true story" upon which The Amityville Horror is based is that the Lutzes bought a house they couldn't afford, and were drowning in debt. Given the house's history, they concocted the haunted-house story in order to get out from under the payments. This is something that the Lutzes came clean about ten years ago; how Douglas can get away with "based on a true story" is utterly beyond me. (Though in his defense, the extras do make it seem like he really bought the story hook, line, and sinker; obviously, the Lutzes' confession was not nearly as widely popularized as the original story.) I'm surprised no one's filed a class action lawsuit against the film's crew for representing it as true. (Even IMDB recognizes the hoax; the original film is listed bas based on Jay Anson's book, while the new one lists it as based on Jay Anson's novel.) James Frey is small potatoes, in comparison.<br /><br />That aside, comparing this to the original Stuart Rosenberg flick from 1979 is almost a painful experience. Both films are mediocre examples of filmmaking, but whereas Rosenberg's movie is fully realized in its mediocrity, Douglas has crafted a film that had almost limitless potential, and he threw most of it away piece by ugly piece.<br /><br />The one thing Douglas did right was toss out most of the conventions people were expecting from the '79 movie-- the infamous flies show up in only one scene, and pig-Jodie (the "glowing red eyes outside the window" shot the original made so famous) is nowhere to be found. While it is almost always the case that suggesting the demon is scarier than showing the demon, the version of Jodie found in this movie is far, far creepier than a pair of floating red eyes and a vague, pig-looking shadow. Also, the writers added a few touches that had the potential to make the story more interesting, such as the tentative relationship between George and the kids. The best thing they could have done would have been to dump the original script altogether and simply make a haunted-house flick that wore its allegiance to the '79 film on its sleeve. To his credit, it seems like twisted, brilliant screenwriter Scott Kosar (El Maquinista) attempted to do just that, but got hamstrung.<br /><br />For those who have been living in a cave for the past thirty years, the story, as originally told by the Lutzes: George and Kathy Lutz (here portrayed by Blade Trinity's Ryan Reynolds and Down with Love's Melissa George, respectively) bought a house in Amityville, New York, in 1975. Like all houses for which you get an incredible, deal, it's haunted. In this case, the year before, Ronald DeFeo, the son of the previous owner, had murdered the rest of his family in the house, claiming he'd heard voices telling him to do it. When George, Kathy, and family moved in, the same voices haunted them (and a priest they bring in to bless the house, whose role, according to the Catholic Diocese of Rockville Center, is "completely exaggerated" in the novel) until, twenty-eight days later, they fled, leaving all their personal possessions, never to return to the house.<br /><br />The acting is actually rather credible. Reynolds overacts a tad, as is his wont, but just a tad; no scenery-chewing here except for Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia), who plays the priest role to the hilt. George is great, and the adult actors are rounded out perfectly by a star turn from Rachel Nichols, of the underrated, short-lived TV series The Inside, as a drugged-out babysitter who tells the kids about the murders.<br /><br />The kids themselves were conventionally cast-- no taking chances on unknowns here-- and are conventional actors. Chelsea (soon to be seen in Zombies, J. S. Cardone's new flick) is your basic overdose of the cute, while Jimmy Bennett (Firewall) and Jesse James (The Butterfly Effect) go through their paces, each demonstrating the ability to cry on command.<br /><br />The problem with all this acting talent, which ranges from competent to surprisingly good, is that it's all hung on a framework that's so scrappy it can't even get the hallowed Hollywood tradition of the emotional shortcut right. The film's severely abbreviated length-- eighty-nine minutes-- could be written off as the culprit, but the deleted scenes don't show that there was any effort whatsoever to try and trace the emotions from point A to point B in the script. George goes from being kind, loving dad (which the script spent a good deal of time setting up, mind you, making the first moments of the film intensely boring) to raging jerk in the space of a heartbeat, then spends the rest of the movie rapid-cycling. This is one place the original film works much better than this one; James Brolin's gradual descent into madness plays, whereas Reynolds has a precipice instead of a descent. The funny thing is, he's still got twenty-seven days after he jumps off said precipice to hang around and be useless.<br /><br />More frustrating, the emotional scraps hang on the framework of a really good plot. Once you get about halfway into the film, the changes made to the original story start coming through, and they whip it into much better shape. There's a good deal more sense to be made out of everything, and one minor twist made to the DeFeo story ties everything together with brilliant economy. Again, construct all this on a different framework and give your actors real parts to work with, and you potentially have the best American horror flick of the past ten or fifteen years. Instead, something happened. I don't know what.<br /><br />The end result is a mediocre film that could have been great. **</p></body></html>

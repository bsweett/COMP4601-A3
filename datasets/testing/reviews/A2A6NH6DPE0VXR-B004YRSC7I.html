<meta name="summary" content="You'll remember Memento!"></head><body><p>Memento is a film I had a little trouble following at times and I have to see it again to truly understand it. Still though, it's a really an original piece of work. It's not every film where you hear the lead charcater say &quot;I'm chasing someone,....oh wait, he's chasing me&quot;, I love scenes like that. Guy Pearce does a great job in the film too, it's an very unusual role and he handles it very well. Joe Pantalino and Carrie Anne Moss a very good too as the 2 people he trusts his memories with. Memento is brain twisting and a bit confusing but still, I loved it!</p></body></html>

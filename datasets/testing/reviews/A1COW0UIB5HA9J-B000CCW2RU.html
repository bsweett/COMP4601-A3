<meta name="summary" content="Phenomenal and underappreciated Sci-fi adventure!"></head><body><p>In the year 2019, scientists have created a special underground science facility where people have been cloned are made for research. Fellow clone Lincoln (Ewan Mcgregor) is lonely and feels like a mindless slave to work for genetics, he falls in love with a lovely clone named Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson) and feels like he needs to escape. They have led to believe that the outside world is a mess and one of the only places accessible is an Island through lottery by lives of any slave. After one of the clones gets ill, Lincoln finds out his life was fake as he decides to escape with Jordan into the outside world on the lamb to find the truth, they would later become fugitives.<br /><br />Co-starring Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Sean Bean and Ethan Philips, this is a spectacular and underrated action/Sci-fi drama thrill ride of a movie. The film is inspired by "The Clonus Horror" with a bit of Philip K. Dick and the Aeon Flux animated series, Michael Bay and producer Spielberg know to make crowdpleasing entertainment and this is something different for Bay for once. This represents a chilling idea of what if cloning like this happened in the future of being a person who doesn't know that his or her real self is there in the real world.<br /><br />This DVD only has 2 extras which are audio commentary from Bay and featurette.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Blade Runner", "Akira", "Ghost in The Shell 1 & 2", "The Matrix Trilogy", "Daybreakers", "Metropolis (1927 and 2001)", "Inception", "Transformers (2007) and 2", "Avatar", "Moon", "Pandorum", "Gattaca", "Aeon Flux", "1983", "Children of Men", "12 Monkeys", "Total Recall", "Soylent Green", "Terminator Saga", "Equilibrium", "THX-1138", "Heavy Metal", "I Robot", "Dark City", "The Fifth Element", "Scanners", "Next", "AI Artifical Intelligence", "Surrogates", "Ultraviolet", "The Running Man", "Gamer", "V For Vendetta", "District 9", "Existenz", "6th Day", "Death Race 2000 and Death Race 2008" and "Fahernheit 451".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino's Debut"></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut, Reservoir Dogs is a brilliantly written, unique film that paved the way for Mr. Tarantino's breakthrough film, Pulp Fiction.  The plot of Reservoir Dogs revolves around a diamond heist that goes afoul.  A group of criminals who have never worked together are assembled and given names like Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde.  The film is intercut with flashbacks in which the characters played by Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth are explored in more detail.  Mr. Madsen is incredible as the psychotic Mr. Blonde and his scene in which he brutalizes a cop in medieval fashion is alternately disturbingly brutal and humorous.  Steve Buschemi is a scream as the jumpy Mr. Pink and Mr. Keitel provides the film with its backbone as Mr. White.  Mr. Tarantino has keen eye for detail and the opening scene in a diner in which the crooks are discussing everything from what Madonna meant in her song &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; to 70's songs to tipping contains some of the sharpest dialogue in years.  Mr. Tarantino also uses music to great effect and he overlays scenes with the voice of comedian Steven Wright as host of a radio show K Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's.  Reservoir Dogs is a tremendous debut film and introduced Mr. Tarantino as a force.</p></body></html>

Now thanks to Mel Gibson's epic and realistic film of this 13th century Scottish hero, there are not too many of us who don't know his story.<br /><br />The film, which went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture(among many other awards)depicts Wallace's love and passion for his country, his freedom,his people, and Murron, the woman who's love he would carry with him long after her death, and who made his heart brave.From the touching romance to the bloody battle scenes, the film is filled with intense and stirring moments, and one that will inspire any one to dig down deep inside to stand up for what is right.<br /><br />There are many wonderful reviews here, delving into the storyline of "Braveheart", so I would like to talk about this fabulous DVD. If you do not own a DVD player and are looking for a reason to finally own one, this is the DVD that will get you hooked and you will never look back! I've watched "Braveheart" dozens of times on VHS(and always thought it looked pretty good), but after finally getting a view of the DVD, I felt like I was watching it for the first time. The wonderful cinematography by John Toll is magnificent. The gorgeous scenery and colors come alive. The costumes had details I never noticed before. A little sparkling jewel on the gown of the princess,the make up, even the rain looked so much more vivid.The presentation in widescreen lets you take in every detail of the battles and the castle.You have the choice of Dolby Dig 5.1 Surround or Stereo surround(choose in the set up)and is outstanding.All the sounds of the 13th century and the moving score by James Horner come through beautifully.The film may be viewed in French(stereo) and has captions in English for those who may need them.<br /><br />Special features include commentary by Mel Gibson, theatrical trailers, and a 30 minute featurette "A Filmaker's Passion: The Making of Braveheart", which is entertaining as well as informative.It's a great look at the history of the story, the technical aspects that went into the film and Gibson's own passion for it.(On the lighter side,look for Mel reading a beginners guide to making an epic film).<br /><br />At nearly three hours,I never want it to end. A wonderful love story, an epic adventure,and a piece of history on a great DVD.<br /><br />Enjoy....Laurie<br />also recommended:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EYC">Best Picture Collection - Epic Dramas (Casablanca/Gone With the Wind/Ben-Hur)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009QAIKM">Gandhi</a></p></body></html>

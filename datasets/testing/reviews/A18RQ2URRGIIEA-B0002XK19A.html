Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), made a triumphant return to the big screen in the 2004 sequel "Spider-Man 2".  Again directed by Sam Raimi, "Spider-Man 2" finds Peter Parker struggling to earn a living, lives in a dumpy apartment alone, attending college and continues to crave Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and while saving the lives of people in trouble as costumed & secretive Spider-Man.  However, Spider-Man is starting to have problems slinging webs and scaling walls like a spider, while Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who has taken over the leadership of Oscorp, has invested millions of dollars into a project to create fusion energy as designed by the scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina).  To help him successfully control the fusion reaction, Dr. Octavius designs a set of four cybernetic arms that he attaches along his spinal cord.  While Peter, Harry and a host of invited guests watch Dr. Octavius start the reaction, it suddenly goes out of control and destroys the chip that keeps the cybernetic arms under the control of Dr. Octavius' mind.  The result: Dr. Octavius is taken over by the less-than-ethical cybernetic arms and becomes a powerful criminal force determined to reattempt his dangerous fusion experiment regardless of the consequences.  As for Peter, with diminishing superhero abilities and his desire to recapture Mary Jane's heart from her new fianc&eacute;, the astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) who is also the son of J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons), he decides to throw away his Spider-Man costume in an attempt to live a normal life; but will that be possible with a menace as powerful as Dr. Octavius, a.k.a. Dr. Octopus, roaming the streets and threatening innocent lives?  Will Harry ever come to terms with his father's death, as shown in the first "Spider-Man" film?  You will just have to watch this exciting return of Spider-Man to find out!<br /><br />As with the first "Spider-Man" film in 2002, the 2004 sequel has wonderful cinematography and great special effects.  The story is also quite entertaining and engaging.  Other memorable characters include Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris), Rosalie Octavius (Donna Murphy, who played Anij in the 1998 "Star Trek: Insurrection"), Mr. Aziz (Aasif Mandvi) and a brief appearance from Harry's deceased father, Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).  Overall, I rate "Spider-Man 2" with 4.5 out of 5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

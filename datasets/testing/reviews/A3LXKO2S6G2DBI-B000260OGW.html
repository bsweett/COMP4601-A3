<meta name="summary" content="I Found Myself Actually Wanting Costner's Character to Win."></head><body><p>In general, when I watch a Kevin Costner film, I root for the bad guys that wish to do him ill.  Once in a while, one of the wooden actor's films temporarily changes my mind:  "The Untouchables" and "Dances with Wolves," for instance.  "Open Range" had me cheering for the Costner character, Charlie, in part because he is allied with the almost always satisfying Robert Duvall and in part because one scene in the film delighted me in a way I thought today's American movies could not.  It happens late in the film, during the obligatory exchange of unpleasantries that precedes the obligatory shootout.  I don't want to spoil things too much, but suffice it to say taciturn Charlie dispatches the local gleeful sadist with precisely correct and swift Old West justice and redeems himself from some rather boneheaded decisions earlier.  What follows is one of the better shootouts in recent years, a crackling melee whose inspiration is more "High Noon" than "Gunfight at the OK Corral."  That said, "Open Range" suffers from the typical flaws of modern filmmaking, such as a first half that confuses having people do things with having people do things that are interesting.  It's clear that Costner's understanding of the genre isn't as complete as, say, Clint Eastwood's, even if the pacing here mimics that of "Unforgiven," and he manages to get what is at best an adequate performance out of Annette Benning.  Michael Gambon, as the Irish brute who lords over the town, is sufficiently vile, if cliched; he practically froths at the mouth, his sneering brogue a constant reminder he ain't from around these parts, and despite the fact I couldn't get past Duvall calling the late Michael Jeter "Old Timer" when the latter looks 15 years younger, I found Jeter's performance as a friendly stable owner rich.  Duvall, it should be noted, seems to be playing pretty much the same character he has since "Lonesome Dove" (if not "Tender Mercies"), and it's a good thing he owns it, as it is simply delightful to see him bring to life a guy you wouldn't mind living next door to or working with.  While "Open Range" vaccilates between upholding the mythology of the Old West and skewering it, Costner's performance and direction are fairly solid, if not quite as sure-handed as in "Dances with Wolves."  There are even a few moments of clever subtlety, as in the obligatory male bonding moment, where Charlie inquires about his boss's first name; it's intimated from an earlier scene that beyond solidifying friendship, this is precisely the sort of information that might be needed on a tombstone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hooked on Pinhead"></head><body><p>Hellraiser is an original film made at a time when the genre was seriously bankrupt of new ideas. Hellraiser stands apart  from other 80s horror films and it was welcomed when it first appeared in 1987, a point where Jason and Freddy were slashing screens and the horror genre was by the numbers profiteering.  <p>Clive Barker got to direct his own story and with a budget of only one million dollars he made a very stylish and inventive horror film.  Based on the novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser is about the ends people will go to experience pleasure...and pain.  Frank is a drifter who is presumably bored with his travels and his excesses.  As the film opens he purchases a mysterious, black laquered box and opens it, unleashing unfathomable pain at the hands of the Cenobites--"angels to some, demons to others"--figures from hell led by 'Pinhead'.  Meanwhile, Frank's brother Larry and his wife Julia move into an old family home in England as they try to kick start their icy marriage.<p>Before long, a drop of blood in the floorboards awakens Frank, who escaped the Cenobites and is hiding in a gellatinous, skeletal form.  He begs Julia to help him, and she lures men to the house where Frank consumes them in the hopes of growing flesh back on his slimy bones.  Meanwhile, Frank's daughter Kirstie (from a previous marriage) arrives and suspects all is not well on Ludovico Street.  Eventually she summons the Cenobites, led by Pinhead, and cuts a deal with them so that they reclaim Frank and spare her.  This sets up a cruel and bloody climax between hell and earth. <p>Hellraiser has proven very popular over the years.  It's a gothic horror tale about desire, lust, betrayal, and consequences.  Pinhead immediately became another horror icon alongside Jason, Freddy, and Michael, but he's not a movie slasher and he's not some unstoppable id hunting down teenagers.  Indeed, Pinhead and the rest of the Cenobites (the first two films feature the best crop including the Chatterer, Butterball, and an unnamed female Cenobite played by different actresses) are called by those who have sought out the elusive Box and they provide a kind of ultimate judgement on their souls.  (Both Inferno and Hellseeker, the fifth and sixth installments of the series, respectively, would play this angle.)  Indeed, the Box itself (known as the Lament Configuration) is a recognizable icon as well.  Doug Bradley plays Pinhead and has gone on to be the only consistent factor in every Hellraiser film since. <p>It's still hard to believe this was only made for a million dollars in 1987.  It's not slicked up, and go figure: the effects and makeup look a lot more expensive than the budget would indicate.  These are considered 'old fashioned' makeup effects as well, since today cgi would be cheaper, quicker, and not necessarily better.  Christopher Young provides one of the best modern horror scores and that alone seriously raises the stock of this film.  He would outdo himself with the score to Hellbound: Hellraiser II. <p>Those who don't like gore be warned: this is a very bloody film.  "Jesus wept" indeed.  The Cenobites favor ripping people's skin off with hooks and chains, so you know where that's going.  (Yes, they'll literally tear your soul and you apart.)  However, the gore is not a cheap shock tactic, it's central to the story and is a device Barker uses in his fiction as well.<p>I would highly recommend tracking down the tin box set featuring Hellraiser and Hellbound together along with a gorgeous booklet and chapter index cards.  It's out of print but Amazon always has sellers out there. <p>The film looks and sounds great on DVD, and the commentary is very rewarding.  Barker reveals a lot about the production, and you get the idea that this was a labor of love.  A rare thing when a horror writer of some originality gets control the movie of his own work. <p>Highly recommended for horror films.  This film will deliver some legitimate chills.</p></body></html>

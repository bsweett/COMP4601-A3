<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>I don't think I've ever heard so many racial slurs in a movie, but dang, that was good. I loved Eastwood's hard-nosed character and how he wouldn't take crap from anyone, and whipping Thao into shape and helping him down a better path. The ending was rather bittersweet but appropriate.<br /><br />If my own family was like that (talking about taking me to a retirement home on my birthday!!!) I'd be the same way towards them. The poem 'Do Not Go Into the Good Night' came to mind when I finished watching this film because of Eastwood's character and his toughness. Overall great movie, 4.5/5 stars.</p></body></html>

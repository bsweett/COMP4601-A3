It's interesting such a question would be raised at all, considering most of us really don't want to know; we mentally examine the methodology behind the illusions, yet we understand that if the secrets are revealed, the greatness of the moment is lost. It's a good thing most professional magicians refuse to be so open; giving away an illusion's secret reduces entertainment to a mere technicality. The same can be said for movies, specifically movies about magic. The television ads for "The Illusionist" tell the viewers to not give away the film's secret. True to its word, it does have more than a couple of tricks up its sleeve. And much like a magic trick, each sequence builds on another until a rather elaborate twist ending is reached. At that point, the audience is completely wowed.<br /><br />I say this in spite of the fact that it's not the most original of twist endings. The story is also a bit formulaic, relying on well-established characterizations and assumable outcomes for advancement. However, I found that I could look past these shortcomings; it's quite an entertaining film, effectively mixing mystery with a solid romance. There are also some very good performances, no small feat considering all three leads had to fake believable European accents. It was especially surprising in terms of Edward Norton; his role called for a suave, sophisticated demeanor, pretty much to the point of seeming emotionless. I initially had my doubts that he could pull it off. But as with many of his other roles, he's proven himself capable of rising to the occasion.<br /><br />Based on Steven Millhauser's short story "Eisenheim the Illusionist," the film's components are loosely like those of a fable. Fables are often basic, using shorter formats and simpler language as a way of conveying a moral to a wide audience. While "The Illusionist" has no moral, it does make use of tried and true storytelling methods to get its point across. We have the forbidden love between two classes of people and what they endure in an attempt to live happily ever after. We have the villain who will stop at nothing to keep the incurable lovebirds apart. We have the clever, handsome, enigmatic hero. We have the skeptical side characters. Most importantly, we have entertaining acts of illusion that deceive us just as much as they deceive the characters.<br /><br />The plot in and of itself is constructed less like a fable and more like a mystery novel. Set in early twentieth century Vienna, the story centers on the mysterious stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a man whose grace and charm can bewitch an audience the moment he steps on stage. He was first introduced to magic as a teenager (played by Aaron Johnson). Back then, he was nothing more than the peasant son of a cabinet maker. Then one day, he meets a wandering magician sitting under a tree. From then on, he's a completely different person, devoting all his free time to perfecting the art and craft of magic tricks. And what a time to learn; his skills attract the attention of Sophie von Teschen (played as a teenager by Eleanor Tomlinson), a wealthy young girl of high social stature. As you can probably imagine, the enevitable romance is strictly forbidden. Ultimately, the two are forcefully separated.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Eisenheim is back in Austria after having travelled the world in the study of magic. He is rapidly becoming one of the country's most popular illusionists, thrilling audiences with his impeccable sense of timing and style. He can make an orange tree grow from an empty pot. He can make a reflection behave differently than the real person. He can even make coins appear out of a red handkerchief. Word of his astounding illusions quickly reaches Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), the arrogant, immature successor to the throne of Austria. He decides to attend one of the magician's shows. However, it's not because he wants be entertained; rather, he wants to expose Eisenheim as a fraud by purposely trying to poke holes in the act. It would seem that only he has such an agenda. Everyone else, he's astonished to discover, is actually willing to enjoy the show.<br /><br />At this point, the plot thickens dramatically. The Prince's intended is none other than Sophie von Teschen (now played by Jessica Biel), and when attending the performance with her fiancee, she finds herself assisting Eisenheim in one of his tricks. Right away, the two recognize each other from their childhoods, and old feelings resurface. The two begin an intesnse love affair, one the audience knows will end very badly if discovered. Unfortunately, Leopold rules everything with an iron fist, especially when it comes to marriage. Bodyguards and spies keep a close eye on Sophie on a regular basis, and her romance with Eisenheim is impossible to conceal.<br /><br />Determined to ruin the magician's reputation, Leopold hires Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to keep Eisenheim at bay. Uhl is of a shrewd and practical sort, always looking for the most logical explanation when conducting an investigation. He applies himself fully when it comes to deconstructing Eisenheim's tricks, which are impressive to say the least. At times, Uhl's rational mind is overshadowed by the need to believe; never mind logic and reason. Throughout the course of the film, it becomes one of his most challenging obstacles, and he's eventually forced to choose between loyalty to his country and the desire to expose the truth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't describe any more of the plot. Keep in mind that this is a mystery, and far too many important details--ones that directly relate to the plot twist--are at stake. What I can say is that Eisenheim's simple sleight-of-hand illusions are eventually discarded for the ability to call forth dead spirits. This ability earns him a devoted following, one that puts a serious damper on Uhl's investigation and Leopold's vindictiveness. Like in all good mysteries, it eventually becomes a matter of putting the pieces together to form a clear picture.<br /><br />I realize that the previous paragraph was incredibly vague, but short of giving everything away, there's really no other way to say it. I'd rather you go and see the film for yourself. There's so much about it that works, especially the final scenes; they're appropriately sequenced, serving as a testament to the trickery magicians are known for. A lot of audiences don't like being fooled at the movies these days; they seem to think that fooling is only appropriate in live magic shows, where they actually look forward to asking, "How did he do that?" Not only does "The Illusionist" have all the best qualities of a live magic show, it also effectively reinterprets the classic Love Conquers All fable. I enjoyed this movie; it's clever, it's sneaky, and it delightfully toys with the audience's beliefs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Creepy not Scary...."></head><body><p>This movie is not for your hardcore horror fans, becuase it is not that kind of movie...this movie is more of a creepy factor than a chop off a head and scream movie.  It is so funny because all of the buzz I hear is because there are American's in Japan...ummmm...do you think we never move?!  You really never see the "grudges" face besides as a woman who looks simialr to the lady in the ring and as a little boy (who is the scariest part of the movie--he is definately creepy!)  Over-all I was relunctant to see this movie at the theaters because of people either really loving it or hating it so I waited until video and I will say that I liked it for a creepy supsense plot not as a great horror film--as many are trying to make it.  I liked this movie but I doubt I will ever own it...didn't find it worth that much...maybe later in a bargin bin...but it is worth renting.</p></body></html>

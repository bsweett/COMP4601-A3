<meta name="summary" content="The flaws of heroes"></head><body><p>There are numerous reviews posted on this excellent film but few of them mention the fatal flaws of the two talented young magicians that eventually leads to their separate painful downfalls.<br /><br />Two young talented men work together and are fascinated by the field of magic performance. One accidentally, and maybe subconsciously, ties a rope too tight and this results in the drowning death of the other young magician's wife. Now the story becomes one of revenge as Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman), the handsome widower, begins to plot revenge against Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale). Interestingly these two men would have been superb partners since Borden is the better technical illusionist whereas Alfred is the better showman. Michale Caine plays the role of a man who designs magic tricks and coaches magicians. He actually plays the conscious of Robert, the voice of morality and reason, that Robert sometimes hears and sometimes ignores. David Bowie plays the mysterious Dr. Testler in Colorado Springs, who has developed a machine that will reproduce anything put into its chamber. Testler is actually the devil, the force of evil that grants a man a superhuman gift so that the gift can bring about their downfall. This is the major character flaw of Robert. His grief and desire for revenge remain his motivation for living and even keeps him blind to the advantages of loving his lovely assistant, played by Scarlette Johansson. But Alfred Borden has his flaws too. Alfred has a twin and he keeps this secret even from his wife, which only acts to pull them apart and eventually result in her suicide.<br /><br />Revenge and secrecy from those we love are two character flaws that bring both men down in this morality play of the first order. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

This movie is so bad it would be inappropriate for me to explain what is bad about it.  This would be analogous to calling the cops to a scene of mass slaughter and having them arrive and say, &quot;Sooo... what seems to be the trouble here?&quot;<br />&quot;Well, these people... they're all dead.&quot;<br />&quot;Aaaand that's... bad?&quot;</p></body></html>

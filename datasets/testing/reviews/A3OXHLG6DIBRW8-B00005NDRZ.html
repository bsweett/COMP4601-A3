<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Horror Movie - Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>The Shining is a classic horror movie that actually caused me to lose some sleep when I first saw it back in the '80s. I'm glad that it is available "On-Demand" so my son and daughter (now that they are old enough) could see this with us.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall put in great performances as "Jack" and "Wendy", respectively, and young Danny Lloyd plays a very creepy Danny\Tony. This is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel by the same name, while it is not as accurate as the later TV movie, it is every bit as creepy and even somewhat more disturbing.<br /><br />Even though this is an older movie and book, there will be no plot spoilers from me: The story centers around a family (Jack, Wendy, and Danny) who take on the winter upkeep of a mountain hotel in the "off season". Jack is hoping to use the time to write a novel, while Wendy and Danny are left to their own devices. Like many King stories, the location and history (both explained very early) of the hotel are key plot elements. Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly going insane is truly brilliant and some of the lines are very memorable.<br /><br />Many of the scenes are often spoofed on popular modern shows, which is why we wanted our teens to see it. I should note that there are a lot of disturbing and gory images all throughout this movie, including some full frontal nudity that I honestly hadn't remembered was in it (likely because I first saw this on "Network" TV). While not a traditional family movie, there are obviously some scenes that can be somewhat awkward.<br /><br />Even with all of that, this is still a fantastic movie that has become part of our popular culture.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

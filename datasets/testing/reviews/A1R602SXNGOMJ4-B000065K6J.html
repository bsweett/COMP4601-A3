Cook) leaves on a trip with 3 friends when she has a vision that there's going to be a major accident on the highway and a lot of people are killed.<br />When this accident actually happens, Kimberly is the lone survivor in the vehicle.  After the accident, all the people who were involved, soon begin to die.  Now it's up to Kimberly and Flight 180 survivor, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) to stop death before it's too late.<br />Although it was a decent movie, it wasn't as good as the first.. it did have a few spots though that made me jump.</p></body></html>

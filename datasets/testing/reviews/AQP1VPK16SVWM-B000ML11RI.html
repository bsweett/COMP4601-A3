<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to a city filled with sin...and salvation for some"></head><body><p>Bloody, violent, sexual without apologies, "Sin City" captures the essence of Frank Miller's comic book. Featuring four stories vaguely connected to each other by the setting and some overlapping characters with the main character being the city itself the film co-directed by writer/artist Miller and Robert Rodriguez (and guest director Quentin Tarentino for one segment), "Sin City" has a terrific cast in a modern day film noir classic.<br /><br />Digitally shot, "Sin City" features a terrific cast including cameos from Michael Duncan Clarke, Elija Wood, Britney Murphy, Carla Gugino (who lights up every scene she's in)and other distinguished folks giving the film signficant star power.<br /><br />The first disc features the theatrical cut of the film along with two commentary tracks--the first with co-directors Miller & Rodriguez and the second with Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino. There is also a third alternate audio track recording of the audience at the Austin premiere of the film.<br /><br />The second disc features the film recut with each segment in chronological order. There are also featurettes on how Rodriguez convinced Miller to make the film, the vintage cars used in the film, the segment that Quentin Tarantino shot,"Booze Borads and Guns: The Props of City City", "Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make Up" "Trench coats and Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City" as well as the teaser and theatrical trailer for the film (and an annoying Miramax promo at the beginning of the disc). The disc winds up with "15 minute Flic School" , "Sin City: Live in Concert", "10 minute Cooking School", "The Long Take" and an "All Green Screen Version". The last featurette shows how the film looked when they were shooting on the set running at "800 times" the normal speed accompanied by Rodriguez's score. Since almost the entire film was shot without any sets, it makes for a surreal almost theatrical experience. Rodriguez's jazzy score accompanies this version of the film (played at normal speed). It's an odd way to spend eight minutes.<br /><br />The stories--a hit man (Josh Hartnett)carries out his job in the beginning and ending segments of the film getting close to his subjects and then killing them almost and treating them with surprising tenderness.<br /><br />The second story concerns Marv (Mickey Rourke)a bull headed thug who decides he has to find out who set him up as a murderer killing the only girl (Jaime King) tht had really been nice to him.<br /><br />The third story takes us into a bad part of town dominated by hard boiled hookers led by Gail (Rosario Dawson). When a nasty, girl friend beating guy named Jackie (Benicio Del Toro)tries to force one of Gail's girls to do something she doesn't want to, Gail and her girls take revenge. Dwight (Clive Owen)who has already had his own run in with Jackie. He wants to take the guy out as well. Gail and Dwight combine forces to take out Jackie unleashing hell on the girl's side of town.<br /><br />The third story focuses on police detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis)as he saves a little girl named Nancy from a pedophile (Nick Stahl). The only problem--the pedophile is the son of a powerful, corrupt politician (Powers Boothe)and the nephew of an evil Catholic Cardinal (Rutger Haur). When Hartigan castrates the senator's son he vows revenge by setting up Hartigan for the rape of Nancy. During his time in prison Nancy (Jessica Alba)stayed in touch with Hartigan secretly writing him letters. Parole comes up and the pedophile wants revenge against Hartigan. He also wants the one girl that got away.<br /><br />A terrific film version of Miller's stories, "Sin City" looks brilliant in its Blu-ray debut with plenty of special features.</p></body></html>

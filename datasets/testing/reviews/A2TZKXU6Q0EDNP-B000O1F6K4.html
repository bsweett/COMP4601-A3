The one about making a b-movie with an expensive cast and then overhyping it to surrealness through trailers and press reviews trying to make it seem as the next "Godfather".<p>  There's no doubt that Rodriguez (that would be the guy who tried to direct this) has a knack for putting together very original action scenes. Then again, I've seen sport-shoe commercials with great action scenes but i don't consider them vehicles of greatness, if you get my drift. Back to Rodriguez, there's a scene towards the beggining of the film, that involves an improbable escape from a window of 5-storey building from 2 people who are chained together. Stretched by the hair to be sure, but nevertheless very imaginative especially when they go crash-landing onto a moving bus passing underneath without even registering a scratch or without losing any make-up.<p>  That's basically how the whole flick flows. Exaggerations upon more exaggerations, shoot'm up and shoot'm down, hey throw in some good ole pointless explosions, let some extras run about while someone from the cast (don't matta who) mows them down in droves, get a nicely tanned cast for the necessary pseudo-sex appeal, and voila! You've got a Mariachi to go with extra cheese please.<p>  Now, if you're the type of viewer that adopts an attitude such as:<br />-to hell with the plot, lemme just turn off my brain for a couple of hours, and watch a shootathon gone berserko<p>  then this is definetely THE movie for you. You found it, you deserve to watch it. Anybody else however might be slightly dissapointed and just a tad bored. Your age might play a role in the equation as well (but that's not a lock...).<p>  Other than that, forgive me for being ignorant in the art of movie-making, but what is a cast like that doing in an utter b-movie like this??? J.Depp does try but as far as i know (and i dont know much) b-movies don't look good on anybody's resume. A.Banderas does what he does best which is using his hair very effectively, W.Dafoe hides (wisely) behind a mask in the vague hope he won't be recognised, and Mickey Rourke adds another long nail in the coffin of a career buried in the depths of the 80s...<p>  There are other actors too, but they serve as target practice mostly.<p>  What i loved most about this majorly forgettable joke-on-celluloid was the hilarious attempt of the scriptwriter to put some philosophical lines in the mouths of the sufefring actors. The result of this effort was the type of philosophy you hear in toothpaste commercials: "because your teeth deserve a better tomorrow". I do have  a lingering suspicion that the scriptwriter was not a Taoist.<p>  Lastly, why 2 stars then for such a wreck? Well, I feel forced to acknowledge that Rodriguez did an incredible job giving the word "exaggeration" a whole new meaning. When i saw J.Depp having gone blind and still outshooting his opponents ..without blinking, i thought "wow, this tops it all"...<p>  A grandiose b-movie yes, that will still fail to make the top-10 of it srespective category.</p></body></html>

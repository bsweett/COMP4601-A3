Nice Lovecraft stuff sure, but additionally we get an interestingly compelling villain in the silent decaying assassin who dons various gas masks and wields knives in effective ninja style.  The demon Hellboy squirts through the portal before the allies close it and is raised by an old looking John Hurt.  Flash forward and the main antagonists are again at it in the 2000's, Hellboy in adolescence is joined by other paranormal fighters and must stop them.  The makeup on Perlman is pretty good and the CG effects aren't too bad.  It's not too engrossing but it was a pleasant time killer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An awesome sequel that tops the first"></head><body><p>I just saw X-Men 2 and I must say I was blown away. I liked the first but after seeing this one I saw just how good the first one could have been. The first was basically just a small introduction. Now that all the characters were introduced we have a sequel that's all action and has no time for introduction. The result is one [heck] of a ride, this film gave me the feel that I was actually watching the cartoon series from the 90's that I loved. I can't say the first film really gave me that feel at all eventhough I did like it. <p>  I have a problem with the fact that they didn't give Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike a history. In the comic book they were ex lovers. Deathstrike blames Wolverine for the death of her scientist father in the comic, you don't get that here. Instead she's just a mutant being controlled by the evil mutant hater General Striker (Brian Coxx "the original Hannibal Lector from Manhunter"). I also disapointed that the first film didn't give Wolverine and Sabortooth a history as well. I was hoping they'd bring Sabortooth back so they could have Wolverine figure out that his past connects to Sabortooth. <p>  The first also was short, it spent most of it's time introducing the characters when not all of them were even there. In this sequel we don't get Beast or Gambit but we do get Night Crawler. Alan Cummings "Spy Kids", pulls off the role just awesome. The special effects that make it so he can appear where ever he wants are just great. The make-up for that character are well done as well. Colosis who is also another popular X-Man has a short but cool cameo where he saves some mutant children at the school.<p> <p>  This film is a lot more like the comic book than the first and should do many X-Men fans proud. The whole Jean Grey sub-plot will surprise but delight most X-Men fans such as myself. I don't wanna give anything away but I find that with Jean Grey the film does have sort of a Star Trek 2 ending. Part 3 already is giving me a Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock sorta feel and it's not even out yet. Part 3 will probably be largely surrounded around Jean Grey's character just like Star Trek 3 was with Spock. I can't wait for that though. I don't wanna give anything but for any X-Men fans that know of the Phoenix saga you are gonna love this. I wouldn't mind seeing a new Mutant villain come around for the 3rd one as well though. I'm dieing to see Juggernaut for instance. Apocolyse would be cool as well. X-Men 2 is another strong movie for Marvel and could possibly be the best. Yes even better than Spiderman.</p></body></html>

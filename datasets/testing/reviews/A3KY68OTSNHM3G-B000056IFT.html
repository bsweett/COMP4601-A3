<meta name="summary" content="One of Schwarzenegger's Best"></head><body><p>Total Recall is set in the future after Mars has been colonized.  People are able to take "vacations" by having a type of brain implant placed in their heads. Alternate options are also available to help enhance one's "vacation".<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Doug Quaid, a working man who has trouble with reoccuring dreams about an event that happened on Mars, but he is unable to figure out what exactly happened.  Sharon Stone stars as Lori Quaid, Doug's beautiful but mysterious wife. Doug decides to visit ReKall, Inc., the company who specializes in the implanted vacations.  He chooses a visit to Mars as an undercover secret agent to confront the nemesis of his dreams; the evil Mars administrator played by Ronny Cox. Doug was somehow transformed by Cox and his associates, and he no longer has any memory of the events. Doug finds out more than he cares to, and he is left to find out who he really is.  Is he simply Doug, or is he someone else altogether?  <p>The plot of the movie is excellent and is loaded with top notch special effects.  The hologram scenes are especially well-done. This is a typical Schwarzenegger movie; a high body count and lots of good one-liners to keep everyone amused. Sci fi fans are sure to enjoy this fast paced thriller.</p></body></html>

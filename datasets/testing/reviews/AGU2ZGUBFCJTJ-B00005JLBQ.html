<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - Entertaining 'Road'"></head><body><p>Road to Perdition, based on the 1998 graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, is the first film for director Sam Mendes since his Academy Award winning film, American Beauty. The film is also a first for one of its stars, Tom Hanks. As promoted by Dreamworks Pictures, this is the first time where you see Tom Hanks as a villain in a feature film. Tom Hanks alone should be a big draw for many moviegoers but who can argue with world of marketing. The film also features some other big stars outside of Tom Hanks. They would include Paul Newman, who worked The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Jude Law, whose works include A.I. and Enemy at the Gates. But will these big stars be a big enough draw to have moviegoers sit through a depressing gangster film?<p>The story that Michael Sullivan is caring and loving husband and father. Set in early 1930's in the city of Chicago, Sullivan works for Mr. John Rooney. Michael never had a father, so Rooney raised him as his own and taught him the ropes of the business he was involved with. Now all grown up and having a family of his own, Sullivan's life changes in many dramatic ways. His oldest son, curious of what his father does for a living, sneaks into the back of his car the night of one of his jobs. The young boy witnesses the accidental murder a man and discoveries that he father is part of the mob. Sullivan assures Rooney that the boy will remain silent but the mob is not so sure. To secure silence they murder Sullivan's wife and other son. This sends Michael Sullivan on an unpredictable journey to the town of Perdition as he tries to save the life of his son and seek revenge on the people he once called family. Road to Perdition's story is very well done though long. The film has plenty of gunfight sequences but for long stretches there are moments that just seem long and boring with continuous talking. Not to say the dialogues is bad, not at all, but to say that there seems to be too much in certain areas.<p>The acting is top notch in Road to Perdition with the all-star cast advertised very prominently. Tom Hanks performs exceptionally well, as usual. I do not agree that his character is actually a villain in the film. How is he a villain when he tries to save the life of his son? Just because he is a gangster makes him a villain? One can make an argument for either side but it can be said there is a middle ground for his character. Paul Newman gives one of his best performances as the head of a mobster family. His lines are probably the most memorable in the entire film not because of where they are featured but for the emotion he uses to say those lines. Jude Law is well placed as the "Reporter", though I believe his character wasn't as necessary as most of the other characters in the film. Other supporting characters were well done but not hugely outstanding in the film.?<p>Road to Perdition is a good film but not a great film. It is a film that is just a normally good popcorn flick and nothing beyond that. The dialogue was good and the story was interesting but there are some conflicts with what happens in the film. Most of the characters in the film are gangsters and know they are involved in a life of murder and greed but when bad things happen, they seem all shocked that it is happening to them. You weren't expecting that? Also, some of the characters, including the boy who plays the son of Michael Sullivan, seem pretty dull and don't really do anything to show a hugely exceptional performance. Another problem was the relationship between Sullivan and his son. You don't really get to see much closeness between the two and yet in the end, they both seem to be on good terms. There were some signs but not a huge lot. Outside of those small scrabbles, the film is very well presented especially with the beautiful sets and the great use of cinematography. Road to Perdition should at least be checked out on DVD or VHS once for its artistic merit.</p></body></html>

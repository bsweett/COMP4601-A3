This is a no nonsense, highly efficient killing machine! As sequels go this is really good and is just as entertaining as the original. I had no problems with the camera work as some reviewers have pointed out. It's a fast paced, action film with an intelligent story! The DVD transfer looks great and this film was followed by a sequel!</p></body></html>

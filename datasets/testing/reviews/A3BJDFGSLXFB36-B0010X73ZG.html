<meta name="summary" content="Above average Stephen King adaptation"></head><body><p>When it comes to Stephen King's films being adapted for the big screen, it's usually a crap-shoot. There have been some films that were extraordinarily bad, some that we extraordinarily good, and some that were just so-so.<br /><br />"The Mist", however, is one of the films that holds up well when compared to the original story, except for the ending. The book ends with a slight hope for the future, whereas the film had a "Twilight Zone-ish" ending. Why Frank Darabont (who did amazing work with "The Green Mile") chose to make such a change is beyond me, but I guess in the long run, it did have more of an emotional impact.<br /><br />I was able to identify with the characters and their initial plight (surviving Hurricane Katrina was similar to what the townspeople went through during the aftermath of the storm, though on a MUCH smaller scale)and I truly cared about what happened to them.<br /><br />A simple trip to the supermarket quickly turns into a nightmare and the pace and suspense of the film never lets up until the very end. The special effects are quite convincing and the performances by the actors are very well done.<br /><br />Overall, "The Mist" is a very good horror/suspense film that should keep you quite entertained for the two-hour running time. You will want to keep the kiddies away from this one, though. Lots of swearing, graphic violence, scary creatures, and a bit of gore.<br /><br />Not recommended for the feint of heart.</p></body></html>

This will by no means be an Oscar contender, but as a pleasant diversion on a weekend afternoon, or possibly as a date movie (for those who still go on dates), this could be a winning movie.  Jennifer Aniston, late of 'Friends', plays a role that is in many ways reminiscent of the Rachel role - she is a transplanted New Yorker, returning home to L.A. (actually, Pasadena, which becomes a running joke) with her as-yet-unannounced fianc&eacute; to attend her younger sister's wedding.  We learn all of this in the first few minutes, possibly before the credits are done scrolling on the screen - the frenetic pace of 'Friends' is still here.<br /><br />Rumour has it that there was a family in Pasadena that the film 'The Graduate' is based upon - Sarah (Anniston) fixates upon the idea that this may be her family.  She questions her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine, but don't call her grandmother), who tells of a possible affair her mother had with a playboy before her marriage (Kevin Costner, now a dot-com mega-millionaire).  Sarah goes off without her fianc&eacute; in search of her mother's past, but finds a past of her own, of a sort.<br /><br />Lots of twists and turns in the film have the characters racing up and down the coast of California in search of the past, the future, and the truth, which ends up being both expected and unexpected in this complicated but easily-followed plot.<br /><br />There aren't major effects and major surprises here.  The situational comedy is very much in keeping with an extended version of a comfortable television show, even with the star power of MacLaine and Costner backing Anniston up.  The writing is serviceable with occasional flashes of true wit, and the pace of the film is even and pleasant.  In all, this is a good film, well worth seeing for a bit of entertainment.  Director Rob Reiner does have a talent for good films, and this is one of them.</p></body></html>

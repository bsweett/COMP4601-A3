<meta name="summary" content="consistently excellent, but a bit too much shooting here"></head><body><p>This is a worthy ending to this series.  While I tired somewhat of the cowboy stuff that naturally accompanies a climax, the dark vision and ambiguous ending of the film mark it as truly outstanding sci-fi.  Sure, the ending was happy, but troubles for the future are very clearly in the making.  The greatest surprize of all is the maintenance of the cryptic - and logically consistent - references that were so much fun in the 2nd part.  Moreover, it is never fully explained, but left to the imaginative to puzzle out, if they so wish.  Indeed, there are added delicious mysteries, like the little Indian girl and the transforamtion of the oracle.  <p>REcommended for serious fans of sci-fi.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like Empire"></head><body><p>Watching this third installment of Resident Evil is like watching The Empire Strikes Back without having seen any other Star Wars movies.  The T-virus has devastated the world and Alice has escaped from where she was et the end of the second movie.  Everything is dying and there are few remaining survivors.  Alice meets up with a convoy of survivors while the Umbrella Corporation is trying to find her to further their own research.<br />Alice knows some of the people in the convoy and there is a history.  There are references to events not in the previous movies.  Alice exhibits some new talents.  But in the end it seems like very little has happened or been resolved.<br />I really enjoyed the first two movies but was at a loss with this one.  I am convinced that in order to appreciate this movie you have to by the two-movie edition of the first films that includes the important linking story.  I wish they had included it with this movie as I don't feel like buying the other two a second time.  This movie is set in the desert and the daylight thus giving it a different feel than the other two.  But it is the lack of a complete story that is its downfall.  With no real beginning or end this is just a snapshot in time.  I can't really recommend this one.</p></body></html>

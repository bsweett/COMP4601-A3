<meta name="summary" content="The Scent of a Woman"></head><body><p>Jean Baptiste Grenouille's (Ben Whishaw) birth foreshadowed his future.  His fishmonger mother squirted him out like the four stillborn babes before him.  When she believed him dead, she left him to be tossed with the day's guts.  His cry saved him--and damned his mother to the gallows.<br /><br />From there, the baby went to an orphanage, raised just old enough to be sold as a servant to a tannery.  A trip to town taught him there was more to smell than just dead animal hides.<br /><br />His sense of smell brings him to the attention of once famous perfumier, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) who teaches him everything he knows--until his protege tries to cook down the cat to gain its essence.<br /><br />From there, he continues in search of the perfect scent and discovers the best way to obtain a truly divine perfume--which happens to be rendered from the rendered fat of women he killed.<br /><br />"Perfume" details the killer's process of 'discovering' his perfect perfume.  As one might expect, the dehumanization of of Grenouille's own life gave him no concept of any other--animal or human. His progress from animal killer to human serial killer is grisly, shocking, and far too realistic.<br /><br />Cinematography was excellent. Whishaw, Hoffman, and Alan Rickman as Richis, a local nobel desperately seeking the man who killed his daughter, were all convincing. Certain elements of the story were unfortunately somewhat surreal.<br /><br />"Perfume" is a one-time view for me.  The story pushed far too many buttons for me--and frankly was slow enough in more than one place to make me want to stop before the end.</p></body></html>

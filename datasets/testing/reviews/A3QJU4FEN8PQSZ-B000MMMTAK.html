<meta name="summary" content="Somewhat Funny but Overhyped"></head><body><p>Is it hilarious? Sometimes. But much of its humor depends on sabotaging the hospitality and goodwill of others. How funny or imaginative or original is that? Sure, everyone enjoys seeing feminists called "kitty kat", but that's the pattern for most of the gags - getting invited to sing the national anthem at a rodeo, then upsetting the crowd by singing a crude, made-up version of his own seems less like humor (although I did laugh) and more like being a jerk.<br /><br />His fake accent also quickly wears thin, like a poor man's version of Inspector Clouseau - for this he got a Best Actor nomination? Perhaps it was more tied to his "May George Bush drink the blood of every Iraqi woman and child" speech than his acting. (Well, that *was* kind of funny.)<br /><br />The scene where abuses the trust of a group of Pentecostals was among several eye-openers, to be sure, as is his apparent exposure of a few bigots. His "Running of the Jew" scene was priceless, as was their escape from the Jewish Bed-and-Breakfast of Death.</p></body></html>

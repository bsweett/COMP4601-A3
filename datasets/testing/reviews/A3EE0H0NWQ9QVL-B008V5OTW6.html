He takes the 1972 Olympic slayings of innocent Israeli athletes and recreates the ordeal in all its horrifying detail.  We get some of the footage from ABC's "Wide World of Sports" to create authenticity, but the reinactment has all the immediacy and horror of "Schindler's List" and more.  After the outrage, one of Golda Meier's trusted bodyguards (Eric Bana) is summoned to join a team of assassins meant to seek vengeance on the perpetrators.  The vast majority of the movie focuses on the complexity, the obsession, and the miscalculations that come from this type of counter-terrorism.  The missteps are harrowing.  The most touching scene is when they are set to bomb an assassin at his residence, but they immediately need to stop it when his adorable little daughter unexpectedly reappears.<br /><br />There has been much commentary made about the agenda of this movie.  Despite any stance, Spielburgh has made a relevant movie, a true movie, at a crucial time.  The movie questions the premise of festering violence and its consequences.  It does so through the dialogue without preaching, but mainly through the action which is often horrifying and brimming with suspense.  There are two matching scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end, where the maverick protagonist has an intimate scene with his wife.  It doesn't really give away too much of the movie, but it frames the theme of the film.  He has become a hero to his people for requiting the crimes of the extremists, but it illustrates that he has done so at a high personal price.</p></body></html>

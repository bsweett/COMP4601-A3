<meta name="summary" content="Transporter 2 (DVD)"></head><body><p>Frank Martin is someone you definitely would want on the school-carpool rotation.<br /><br />He's punctual, he loves kids and he handles a car in ways to suggest he invented the phrase, "Professional driver on a closed course; do not attempt."<br /><br />When Frank slips behind the wheel, The Transporter 2 races along at 200 mph, the turbo-charged Audi sedan expressing more personality than much of the cast. But when the action gives way to plot, the movie slows to a rush-hour crawl and you're hoping Frank either gets back into the car or walks into a dark alley to face a dozen thugs, whom he will keenly dispatch with his editing-room-enhanced martial-arts skills. Jason Statham reprises his role from the 2002 original as Frank, a professional transporter (like the FedEx guy, only he absolutely, positively gets it there, thanks to high-speed pursuits). Now he's in charge of ferrying 6-year-old Jack to school and back.<br /><br />The problem is that Jack's father Mr. Billings (Matthew Modine) is a federal drug czar whose policies have angered several drug cartels. Though an army of men as well-armed as they are dressed surround Billings, Frank and Jack tool around the streets of Miami by themselves. So when Frank accompanies Jack to the doctor on a Saturday (talk about far-fetched), everyone but those in the security detail know this isn't going to go well.<br /><br />Frank repels the initial attack but the fates, and the bad guys, catch up. The ensuing car chase is the movie's set piece, a dazzling automotive ballet of spinning, twisting and careening vehicles, Swan Lake interpreted by NASCAR.<br /><br />Jack eventually is kidnapped, and Frank is determined to get him back, no matter how many cars are crashed or faces pummeled.<br /><br />Set designers must have been giddy while preparing a room for one of the several 10-on-Frank fights. Frank uses every prop at his disposal, including chairs, tables, pipes, ladders and, in the most inventive showdown, a fire hose.<br /><br />Villainous combatants closely adhere to Hollywood's fight-sequence rules, attacking Jack one at a time. Not sure how the order was determined. Perhaps it was weakest to strongest, or they simply drew straws.<br /><br />If the plot missteps, it's when it abandons its live-action-cartoon intentions to put a 6-year-old boy in grave peril, as Jack is injected with a lethal serum (leaving Frank to seek the antidote). It seems out of place in a film whose entertainment value is based solely on outlandish stunts.<br /><br />Transporter 2 is high-octane fluff, a feature-length car commercial on steroids that never tries, or pretends to be, anything more. At that level it works. And with gasoline at $3 a gallon and more, enjoy it as an indulgent fantasy.</p></body></html>

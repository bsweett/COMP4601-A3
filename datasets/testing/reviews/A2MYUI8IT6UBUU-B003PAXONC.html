<meta name="summary" content="I Am Legend Movie Review"></head><body><p>While this is the fourth time the story for I Am Legend has been adapted for film (first as The Last Man on Earth, second as The Omega Man and third as I Am Omega), the script is unduly similar to countless other horror and sci-fi films of late. Lone survivor Neville faces the monotony of isolation (as seen in Cast Away) and grasps at the hope that he can discover a cure for the virus that has wiped out civilization (as seen in the equally mediocre Resident Evil). The constant "jump" scares become predictable and the stodgy creature designs are curiously reminiscent of The Mummy's Imhotep. I Am Legend is unfortunately one of those films that may be entertaining at first glance, but will be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />From the first few minutes of the film it is more than apparent that the last man on earth is not alone. And that's when the suspense hits. The most impressive and annoying aspect of I Am Legend is the wavering suspense turned to constant apprehension. It is not intellectual or psychological suspense like that found in Alfred Hitchcock's legendary works, but mere "jump scares" that create shock from the unexpected. Startling the audience with fulminating noises, sudden movements and creatures lashing out at the screen, this is clearly the poor man's replacement for genuine scares. The constant fright builds plenty of anticipation, but due to the regular intervals of scream-inducing moments, it becomes rather predictable as the movie progresses.<br /><br />A lot has been left to the imagination, especially during the adaptation of the novel, of which the film deviates so greatly that taking its title was far from necessary. The post virus break out is narrated through dream sequences and flashbacks to explain why Neville is alone in New York. While much of the deterioration of humans into vampiric zombies is not covered, the reverse effect, in which the creatures begin to grow smarter and appear to follow a leader, is completely untouched by explanation. In fact, the last we hear of Neville's experiments is that they have de-evolved into the most primitive of life forms - and the very next second they are plotting intricate traps and training zombie dogs to attack.<br /><br />In an attempt to demonstrate Neville's loneliness as the last man on earth, he sets up mannequins in the neighboring video rental store to simulate interactivity with humans. It is a relatively successful demonstration of the mental instabilities he suffers due to extreme isolation, but even at its finest, when he finally confronts a female mannequin that he continually jokes with his dog about approaching, it feels like an inferior version of Cast Away. At the same time, a single shot of one of the mannequins seemingly turning its head as Neville passes by, is the highlight of the horror creepiness, which is perhaps the only real psychological scare.<br /><br />I Am Legend remains entertaining throughout (mostly due to Smith's onscreen charisma and the incessant jump scares) but ultimately offers nothing new to the genre. Straying far from the novel's more thought-provoking storyline, (involving multiple factions of human digression and vampire tendencies), this Legend never really breaches the sci-fi horror category and often feels all too familiar for those keeping up on their sci-fi/horror films. Superb action sequences help and poor creature designs certainly don't, but enough entertainment can be had that Smith's latest work is worth a look for those interested in the genre; just don't expect anything too legendary.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></body></html>

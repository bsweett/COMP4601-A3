<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely beautiful Cinematography"></head><body><p>This is, in my opinion the best movie of the year.<br /><br />The story may be unpleasant to some, but I thought it was an amazing story/fable set in a beautiful place(France) I believe around the turn of the century.<br /><br />It is the story of a boy born in a gutter (literally) and left to die.This boy was born with a gift though, the gift of smell.<br /><br />Immediately following his birth,<br />his Mother goes to the gallows to hang, and he goes to a horrible orphanage in his first years. Later on he is sold as a slave, and leads a horrible existance- Until he meets a perfumer who teaches him the art and skills in making perfumes.<br /><br />The most important thing in life to him is that he learn how to preserve smell.The smell he is so fascinated in preserving, is the scent of women.<br />Once he learns that you cannot distell a living thing, he travels to Grasse, the leading perfume maker to learn another art in preserving scent.<br />Along the way he begins murdering women, which leads to his capture, and an AMAZING ending.(This film is also VERY educational as it shows how perfumes are distelled and become oil, and also, all the chords of a perfume ie: heart chord, head chord and the base etc. the basic ingredients etc.)<br /><br />Even though there are unpleasant parts in this movie, it has the charm of a fable,The same BEAUTIFUL cinematography as "The Illusionist" did, and the characters were SO well cast.<br />The main character especially.<br />His very soul shows in his eyes.honestly. He was a WONDERFUL actor.<br /><br />I don't know why this movie got so little attention.  at least RENT it, and check it out. I guarantee you will buy it to add to your collection.<br />It is THAT good.</p></body></html>

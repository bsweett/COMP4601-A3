<meta name="summary" content="THE Worst film ever..."></head><body><p>I know I've given it one star, but only because I could not give it a negative 10.<br /><br />.... It's just the "F" word strung together over and over for three plus hours. In fact, if you took out all the times the "F" word was spoken, then you'd have a twenty minute movie....<br /><br />I ran out to see this picture immediately upon its release because I was so impressed with Anderson's Boogie Nights. Now, I use Magnolia as my rating for the worst film ever made....<br /><br />After an hour into the film, I wanted to leave but was certain that it had to get better. After two hours, I felt I had vested too much time in it to leave. At over 3 hours I had to stay until the painstaking end and then I literally, screamed out, "I want those three hours of my life back!"<br /><br />Just absolutely horrible!</p></body></html>

I wanted to like the movie, but I couldn't because it just seemed to predictable. But the thing that annoyed me is the fact that I've seen EVERYTHING in this film done so many times better.<br /><br />Will Smith is the same character he always plays. It's getting a little old. Kevin James is good, but he could have been better. Alot of parts in the movie consist of Kevin James being overly clumsy, and it just seems like a cop out. Amber Valletta seems like the only person taking the movie seriously, and it's refreshing to see someone who isn't acting goofy every 8 seconds. Eva Mendes is terrible. She just isn't likeable or funny. There are some actors who just aren't likeable, and I think she is one of them.<br /><br />Aside from the actors, the script is bland and it's getting old. I'm not saying I hate romantic comedies, but this one has been done so many times. Near the end of the movie the relationships fall apart, and everyone seems to be doing their hardest to be mad at each other. I think you can guess what happens at the end.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie, unless you like not laughing and stupid movies.</p></body></html>

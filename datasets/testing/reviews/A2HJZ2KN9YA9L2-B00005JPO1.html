Not too daunted, and, being Jewish, getting angry at the rise of Nazis in Germany, they made Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Having learned from their mistake the first time around, this one got a much wider release, and a year later, they re-released Temple of Doom.  Still angry at the Nazis, in 1939 they kept them as the villains when they made Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.<br />Then, their political passions got the better of them and they went to war.<br />Afterwards, they came back , did some other movies independently, and their Indiana Jones movies seemed all but forgotten.  With the advent of television however, their movies found a new audience.  This inspired the filmmaking team to do an updated modern day adventure.  With rumors of a flying saucer crash in Roswell, the Russians as a new threat to national security and some odd paranormal skulls one of the writers read about, they thought they had the makings of a pretty decent plot.  With the threat of nuclear war & multiple bomb tests taking place, it worked in some more contemporary action sequences.<br />This is the attitude Lucas & Spielberg had when they made this movie.  It is a mock period piece like Tarantino's & Rodriguez's Grindhouse and the earlier Indiana Jones & all of the Star Wars movies.  The biggest difference is that those movies all seem firmly set as movies which could have been made in the 1930's, while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a period piece of the 50's.Fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Arthur Conan Doyle and H. Rider Haggard will recognize this as being a reflection of the same type of literature which they used to produce.  Burroughs tried to have Tarzan pass the torch of adventure to his son, which never quite caught on, Doyle eventually had Sherlock Holmes retire to beekeeping where he would still eventually find himself in an adventure or two.  These authors kept the heroes going a bit past their prime, let them get older.<br />In this era of having franchises get rebooted (Batman, Bond) in order to reflect current sensibilities, Lucas & Spielberg have decided to let their hero, and the world around him age, not to the present, but to where things are becoming increasingly familiar.</p></body></html>

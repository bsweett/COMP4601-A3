<meta name="summary" content="United 93"></head><body><p>'United 93' is the powerful and moving look at the events on September 11th 2001. It focuses on the air traffic control centres that had to deal with the hijacked planes, the military response, as well as the events on flight United 93. I found this film moved very quickly and I was engrossed throughout. You get a real sense of the panic and confusion on that day and it goes some way to showing how difficult it must have been to deal with as it occurred. I was concerned this film would be pro American and biased, but it didn't seem to excessive in that respect and it gave the film all the more impact because of that. I found myself extremely choked up when the passengers on the flight were ringing relatives to say goodbye and couldn't even begin to imagine having to do something like that. The ending is full of drama and very powerful and although we have no way of truly knowing every event on that flight, this goes some way to portraying the fears and events that may have occurred. The film is excellently directed, the soundtrack works perfectly to move you and the acting is pretty good as well. Highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

It should be boring and predictable, with more plot holes than a slice of Swiss cheese riddled by machine-gun fire.  It should be a dull popcorn piece of entertainment and nothing more.<br /><br />But it isn't.  Instead, it's an edge-of-your-seat adrenaline rush from opening to close, a barrage of bullets and kick-a** moves that leaves you reeling.  Sure, it's cliched, and sure, almost all of the stunts here are theoretically impossible, but the amazing thing is that you never really care.  Liam Neeson's quest to save his daughter from the world of sex slave trafficking is a rollicking ride, fueled by Neeson's acting chops (finally, an action hero who uses his brain as much as his fists, and not to mention some silver-tongued threats) and director Pierre Morel's sense of style.  (Let's also not forget writer/producer Luc Besson, who's brought us such contemporary action classics as "The 5th Element" and the genuinely awe-inspiring "Leon, The Professional").  TAKEN isn't necessarily an action movie with brains; it's more of an action movie where you don't care if it has brains or not.  It has gravitas (in the form of Neeson, and let's face it, that was probably one of the best and most surprising casting decisions of the past decade) and skill, and will leave you gasping for breath and cheering for a genuinely likable hero who has "a certain set of skills" and knows exactly how to put them to use.</p></body></html>

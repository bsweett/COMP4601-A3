<meta name="summary" content="A Crime Saga Masterpiece."></head><body><p>A truly amazing film, and too good to ruin by writing a novel sized review. Cast: Among the best ever assembled. Action: Riveting all the way through the three hour movie. Plot: Cop vs Robber, but it is much more then that. The Bank Scene: One of the best action sequences in movie history. The Action: Raw and bloody, De Niro is calculating, fierce and committed, along side his nemesis and tireless rival Al Pacino. Conclusion: You won't know who you'll want to win or who you'll want to lose, brilliant and complex characters played by Oscar winners, what more can you ask for.</p></body></html>

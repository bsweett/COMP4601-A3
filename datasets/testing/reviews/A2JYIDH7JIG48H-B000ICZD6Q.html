<meta name="summary" content="Realistic but not too cynical humor, good chemistry."></head><body><p>In Good Company isn't a hilarious comedy, nor a serious, "edge-of-your-seat" drama - yet something about it made it one of the most absorbing movies of 2005, pleasantly fascinating and easy to watch.  The story is about a middle-aged sales exec (Dennis Quaid) who's company is sold, with over-night demotion and a new boss (Topher Grace), a young whipper-snapper half his age and pathetically callow, though exuding infectious confidence and ambition of youth.  The new boss even naively falls for his older worker's daughter, oblivious to the obvious impracticality.<br /><br />So without a lot of hilarious comedy nor a suspenseful plotline, what makes In Good Company so interesting?  Two things I think.  One, the movie starts out with a premise that lends itself to extremely cynical comedy (like the Simpsons), but very realistically and gradually rises above that temptation to a conclusion that's uplifting in spite of the realistic situation.  Second, the unusual platonic chemistry between the two male leads seems real and strangely appealing, like you want to know these people and root for their friendship.  You don't see that done well in the movies often, and this is probably the most effective case since Cary Grant and Ronald Coleman in Talk Of The Town (in which they were in a romantic triangle with Jean Arthur, so it's really not the same situation).<br /><br />I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the movie to see what I mean.</p></body></html>

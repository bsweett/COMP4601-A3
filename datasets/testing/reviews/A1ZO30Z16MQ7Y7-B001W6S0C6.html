<meta name="summary" content="Batman"></head><body><p>This about a guy who's parnet's were shot down in the streets. The guy now wasnt revenge, and kills crimanal's as Batman. This is a cool film. I didn't likle the old geeky Batman comics, but that one graphic novel was cool. I liked this Batman film the best because there's no annyoing stuip Robin. Fun film to wach.</p></body></html>

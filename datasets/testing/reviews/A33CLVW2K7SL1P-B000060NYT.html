<meta name="summary" content="Justin Long gives the movie its second star..."></head><body><p>This was a train wreck. If I hadn't recognized Justin's face from Dodgeball (ugh, another train wreck), I wouldn't have stopped clicking through the channels. When I saw him, I was interested in how he acted. Dodgeball was all I had seen him in, and I thought he was one of the better aspects of the movie. I hadn't been following his career, so seeing him in this film was new to me.<br /><br />What intrigued me was the polarity of characters that Justin portrayed. One was a terrified teenager, running from your typical Freddy, Jason, Michael, etc. Seriously - there was absolutely nothing unique or interesting in the "bad guy" in this film. Who was he/she, and why did the delightful song "Jeepers Creepers" mean anything to him/her? Are you hard pressed to come up with a logical answer? Me too. This would have been better if the killer had popped out of a lake, or a meteor. Better yet, a cactus. That would have taken some intellect and creativity to resolve.<br /><br />In Dodgeball, Justin was simply running scared because he was absolutely unathletic and didn't have a prayer in that silly game they played. (My opinion of the movie itself, for what it's worth, is, well, it was abysmall. Dogeball was rank. That said, the "gaffer" on that film probably made more in one month than I make in a year. Jerk.) Still, Justin made his character believable in Dodgeball, and honestly saved the film for me (although in such a tiny, minute fashion).<br /><br />In Jeepers Creepers here he did the same, but to a greater extent. I never thought I'd tie two characters of such wildly divergent (B) movies together and say they did an excellent job, but I have to break rank here.<br /><br />The female lead in "Jeepers Creepers", Gina Phillips was an extreme bore. This is unusual in boy/girl horror films. It's usually a given that the girl is favored. Not so here, and that says quite a bit about Justin's abilities. He's only 28, so he has quite a while to catch on to something huge. I hope he does. At the time of the filming of "Jeepers Creepers" he was about 22. Success awaits. (And, lucky guy, he looks far younger than his years account for.)<br /><br />Regarding the film - my lord, this was awful. How did it spawn (or spam) a sequel?? This movie was so lame I can't imagine it making any money on a sequel. Yet the sequel did better with Video Rentals than the original, so all in all it made more money. I've yet to see the sequel, but now am very interested in seeing it.<br /><br />Coming back to the movie at hand...<br /><br />I've read reviews where the reviewer has said that the "villain" was fully realized. I just have to add to this to that..."What?" Were they high? Seriously, the villain in this film was one of the absolute worst I've seen in any horror film. He had no genesis, no modus operandi - in short, he was simply some devilish form that really liked to kill teenagers. Let's all say it togather... "DUH"<br /><br />There isn't much more to say. The movie was no good, but somehow made enough to spawn a sequel. (Blech.) I have a sinking feeling that the original lead actress contracted walking pneumonia and that her understudy played her role. Well, I *had* that "sinking feeling" until I just now when I looked her up on imdb.pro. I was happy to see that Justin has fared better than she has, which makes my semi-prediciton correct. Or, at best, it makes me that much more of a snot. Take your pick.<br /><br />Being a snot is a bad thing. &lt;grin></p></body></html>

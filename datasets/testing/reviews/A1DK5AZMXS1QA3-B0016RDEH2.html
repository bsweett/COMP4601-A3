Young Ofelia is a daughter of a widow, Carmen, who has remarried to a brutal Franco supporter in WWII Spain, Captain Vidal.  Daughter and mother go to live in the countryside headquarters of the captain, who with his soldiers, is fighting local rebels.  Unknown to them, the local villagers working at the soldier's camp contains a doctor and a servant loyal to the rebels.  Ofelia is unwittingly placed into this cat-and-mouse game of ruthless personal violence.  She escapes into a fantasy world, a stone labyrinth situated behind the soldier's camp with origins unknown to all.  There, Ofelia meets Pan, a faun, who tells her that she is a princess disguised in human form.  Pan sets her to three duties in order for her to re-enter the world below as the princess of old.<br /><br />Produced with a Spanish cast and spoken entirely in Spanish, this movie explores many themes unknown to many American viewers.  First of, the movie is set in Spain during the reign of the fascists, an event in history unknown to pop culture since the book "For Whom the Bells Toll".  The resulting interpersonal violence and cruelty is frankly portrayed without any cutaway shots, hence giving the movie a deserved R rating.  Second, the dangers of pregnancy childbirth is also explored, as Carmen dies in the middle of the movie.  As a corollary, we see how Vidal values his unborn child over that of his wife; a trait barely mentioned but still common in some places.  Third, the contrast between Ofelia and Vidal is probably the heart of the movie.  The girl is young and innocent, unable to spare a drop of blood of an innocent to save her own life.  Vidal is all to willing to kill and maim others, and risk his own life in order to attain whatever end he chooses.  Every other character in the movie lies in the spectrum between them.  The servant Mercedes, the village doctor, and the rebels lie closer to Ofelia.  Carmen lies in the middle between Ofelia and Vidal, and the other soldiers are noticeably less reluctant in their cruelty than Vidal.<br /><br />The parallel story of Pan is quite good, original by Western standards.  This fairy tale side of the movie rings true to fairy tales from old; horrific and full of dangerous creatures, with tasks to accomplish and a context of a different world.  The final scene of Ofelia rejoining her true parents is probably the most beautiful in the movie.<br /><br />As a movie, it did OK at the US box office but quite well at various awards ceremonies.  The former was due in part to the Spanish language, and more importantly, the amount of graphic violence.  A reduction in the graphicness of the violence would have brought this movie a PG-13 rating, and probably much larger audiences.  On technical terms, the music was slow, haunting but not great.  The special effects were quite believable.  Overall, a good movie to watch, though adults only.</p></body></html>

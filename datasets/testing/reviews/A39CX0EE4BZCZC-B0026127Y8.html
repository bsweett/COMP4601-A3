<meta name="summary" content="No-Nonsense Neeson Fits The Bill"></head><body><p>Liam Neeson as "Bryan Mills," reminded me of Denzel Washington's role in "Man On Fire."  In that film, Washington played a relentless-and-brutal bodyguard who did what he had to do to get kidnapped Dakota Fanning back to her parents.  Here, Neeson does the same to get his daughter "Kim" back from kidnappers/sex trade slimeballs.  An ex-professional killer in retirement, "Bryan" travels to Paris and shows the bad guys who they're messing with!  Neeson is very good in here.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a little far-fetched but it's a fun hour-and-a-half that's guaranteed to entertain and a no-nonsense, shoot-first film that always satisfies. It also looks good on Blu-Ray. Beware though: this is another "shaky" hand-held camera deal on the action scenes, which can be tough on your eyes at times.<br /><br />One last thing: it's not "non-stop action" as some have said. This movie starts slowly and builds up. It's the last half hour that's non-stop violence, not the whole film.</p></body></html>

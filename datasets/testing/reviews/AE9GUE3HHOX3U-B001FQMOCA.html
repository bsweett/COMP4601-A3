It was entertaining and the music numbers were great, they were the best part of the movie.  I liked Joaquin Phoenix better in "To Die For" and I liked Reese Witherspoon better in "Election".  I think Reese Witherspoon should have won an Oscar for that role rather than this one.  But she did a good job with the musical numbers even though she definatley does not have a genuine country voice.  (Even she herself admits she can't really sing 100 %).  I was more impressed with the music "bio" about Ray Charles with Jamie Foxx.  It was a much better film than this.  Alot of other people including my neighbor and the people at the video store agreed that this wasn't that great of a movie!</p></body></html>

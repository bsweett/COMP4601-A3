<meta name="summary" content="The Rundown is The Rock's best movie!"></head><body><p>"The Rundown" takes place in the Amazon and has The Rock and Seann William Scott fighting each other. The Rock is Beck, a bounty hunter who has to do one more bounty in order to get his job and to have his own restaurant to be a chef. Seann William Scott is Travis Walker, the last bounty he is hunting. Travis is the son of Beck's boss, strangely enough. The beginning of this movie is dynamic with The Rock taking out a whole offensive football line. Unfortunately, when trying to grab Travis, Beck runs into a little trouble from Hatcher, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken, at a bar runned by Mariana, played by Rosario Dawson. Beck and Travis ended up in the Amazon jungle, trying to survive for their lives running from Hatcher. Unfortunately, they again, run into Mariana, who is strangely enough, the leader of the rebels. Travis, Beck and Mariana, look for the artifact that Travis is looking for. They find it, but, unfortunately, falls into Hatcher's hands, as does Mariana. Beck and Travis both return back into the town and get the artifact and Mariana back. The ending is amazingly funny and brilliant. The movie is excellent and I very much recommend it. Go see it any time.</p></body></html>

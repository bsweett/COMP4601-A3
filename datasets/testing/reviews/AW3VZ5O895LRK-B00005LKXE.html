<meta name="summary" content="B- or C+ Movie (was expecting an F)"></head><body><p>From all I'd read about this film, I was really expecting an F viewing experience that I'd turn off after the first half hour.  Much to my surprise, this is a good night's entertainment.  It is NOT as good a work as "Silence of the Lambs," which was a solid "A" film but this film is lacking Jodie Foster and (director) Jonathan Demme so I'm not suprised it doesn't score as well. Anthony Hopkins is once again totally up to par on playing the cannibalistic, murderous psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.  He's been living a low profile for ten years but comes forward when FBI agent Starling makes it into the headlines over a street arrest gone bad.  2 opponents Hannibal must thwart are a rich former victim of his, ably played by Gary Oldman, and Starling's boss, played by Ray Liotta, who turns obnoxiousness  into almost an art form.  I was also glad to see Giancarlo Giannini play an Italian cop in this film, who tries to bring in Hannibal for a monetary reward while Hannibal is in Italy.  Julianne Moore does an able job but one can't help but compare her to Foster and there is too big gulf between the two actors in their levels of talent.  Let's just say that any actor is asking for trouble to try to take on a role Foster has already done.  The extra features are superb on this film and director Ridley Scott is a marvelous film teacher.  His commentary on the DVD is absolutely superb and no matter how you feel about the film, Scott has a lot to show you about making movies.  The special features on this DVD I'd grade an A and hubby absolutely was glued to every moment of them as he's a fiend for "special feature" DVDs.</p></body></html>

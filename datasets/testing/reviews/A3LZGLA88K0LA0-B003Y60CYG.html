<meta name="summary" content="A GOOD SWAN SONG FOR ALTMAN"></head><body><p>With Robert Altman's passing this week, A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION is a fitting swan song for the acclaimed director.  It has his trademark realistic dialogue and without any flashy effects he focuses on the characters.  Based on Garrison Keillor's real life story, the movie shows us the last night for the live radio broadcast of the countrified PHC, replete with awful commercial jingles and some choice scene stealing.  Keillor himself plays GK, the show's host and mentor; his performance is as down home as the story.  Kevin Kline plays the bumbling security chief, Guy Noir, and he is good too.  Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin shine as the Johnson Girls, relics from the past whose vocal harmonies are reminiscent of earlier bluegrass queens, and whose performances are marvelous.  Streep can do anything and she has a good singing voice to boot.  Lindsay Lohan eschews her typical teenie role with her portrayal of Streep's suicide-obsessed daughter who gets her big night to shine as well; L. Q. Jones delivers a small but effective turn as a country singer on his last notes, literally; Virginia Madsen is the mysterious dangerous woman who is really the angel of death; Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly are a hoot as cowboy singers whose songs are purely awful; and Tommy Lee Jones is the corporate axeman who has come to see the last show.  It's all light stuff, but Altman handles it well and it's my favorite Altmqn film, after MASH.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="TUT! TUT! SUCH LANGUAGE --"></head><body><p>The movie plot is acceptable - the action moving along - the language leaves a lot to be desired -<br />This time I watched the extended version.<br /><br />With the oxen - quite enlightening - and Ripley finally shacked up with the doctor. Poor ole widow.<br /><br />Hard to keep track of those crazy prisoners - Now who is the Company man?<br />The disbelief was very noticable until the prisoners were yanked up through the roof [or ceiling].<br /><br />Just a bit of a let-down in Ripley's character almost taking a back seat yet in keeping with the plot.<br /><br />The language was the most glareing fault I found with the whole thing - just increases the common use of the vulgarity [as in everyone uses it] Ha!<br /><br />Aliens 3 was in the line of the first two - for mature audiences only.  Makes a good trilogy - a little less watched as the Predator trilogy but a nice build-up to PvA [sorry guys this one is a lot better than A-3].<br />Don't tell me movies can't be made without vulgarity.<br /><br />No Recommendation - as this one has to be a matter of personal choice.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IRON MAN."></head><body><p>IRON MAN, I saw it when it first came out, it's a Very Good movie, Robert Downey Jr Nailed it on the head in the role, I don't like that Cheadle replaced his friend in the upcoming Iron man Movie. I figure you don't mess with a good thing. It's funny,fun and lots of Action and seems true to the comic book from my point of view. Hope the next installment is as good as this.</p></body></html>

The Wachowski Brothers(directors) and Joel Silver(producer) first blew people's minds with 1999's the Matrix.  It really was something nobody had seen before. So to top it they went over the top, and possibly a little overboard.<p>Neo, now the One, and Trinity are lovers now and he keeps having nightmares of her.  In the middle of this, sentinels(those big bug-like things at the end of the first one) have been dispatched to destroy Zion, the last city on Earth and Neo and Co. are giving very little time to do so.  So Neo goes here and there getting answers and stopping the machines.<p>The problem with this? You can obviously see Silver and the Wachowskis took their budget and used it a lot on special effects.  Remember how in the Matrix the bullet time effect really only rotated around the central screen? Now it's going all over the place.  Remember Neo's brief but sweet fight against Smith in the subway? Well now he's facing 100 of them. Therein lies the problem: waaaaaaay too much.  More fights, more longer fights and more &quot;dazzling&quot; effects, and they do dazzle. But then they go.....and go......and go...... and so on.<p>Despite story shortcomings and an obvious penchant for bigger effects and fights, those fights are rather awesome to watch, seeing Neo doing all these inhuman acrobatics you wish you could do.  Well, a good thing about this movie despite the fights?  You know Revolutions has gotta be better than this</p></body></html>

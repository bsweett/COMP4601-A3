The movie is a recollection of the first Persian Gulf War, told from the point of view of Private Anthony Swofford (who wrote the book, but is played by Jake Gyllenhall) and his trek from marine recruit until the end of Operation Desert Storm.  The war only lasted six weeks, and his contributions only four days, but the process he undergoes is absorbing.  "Swoff" undergoes initiation and later reluctance until he meets his command leader Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Fox) who gets him ready.  His biggest challenge is keeping a fellow marine in check (Fowler, an ex-con) who seems unstable at best and incorrigible at worst.<br /><br />The movie isn't as intense as the most acclaimed war movies, but it isn't less insightful.  We are given a palpable reality.  The scenes show the urgency of missing women, the boredom and agony of anticipation, and the wild comraderie in all its details.  The best scenes are when the narrative focuses on Swoff separate from his brigade and he shares his inner angst.  The dream sequence tells more than any scene and has a surreal stream-of-consciousness effect.  We also get a first-person feel to when they have to play football in the grueling 112 degree heat.  Other revelations are done well, too.  For instance, their frenzy is present when watching "Apocolyse Now".  There's an interview scene where Swoff and others show their reluctance to follow the military's command to keep silence about the downside of being a recruit.  (They're just brimming to tell it like it is.) Later, Swoff gets into big trouble during a holiday party where he shares contraband liquor.  The war itself, for all its brevity, in the movie and in real life, just tells the unvarnished truth.  It shows the war, like any war, in all its mundane horror.  Swoff leaves us with some concrete thoughts about how his experience changed him forever.<br /><br />"Jar Head" is a good movie experience.  It feels genuine.  The performances are fine, too.  Gyllenhall makes the experience authentic, and the supporting cast is believable throughout.  Jamie Fox, in particular, shows an acting range here that makes us appreciate his other contributions.  (His Oscar for "Ray" seems all the more deserving after seeing this film.)  The music and other atmospherics help to create a solid movie--even if it doesn't brim with suspense.  Overall, it doesn't try to sensationalize anything.  (3 1/2-4 stars)</p></body></html>

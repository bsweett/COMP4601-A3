<meta name="summary" content="Can I have these 2 hours back of my life?!"></head><body><p>I got to go to a sneak preview of this movie at my college campus; and let me just say at the end the movie the theater of 100 people were not happy!  Granted none of us really complained because the campus paid for us to see it, but if they hadn't I think that their would be a storm for our money back.  I was extremely excited because after seeing Troy (which was amazing) and knowing Jared Leto(loved him since My So Called Life--plus his parts in the movie were choppy; like they started to give him a scene but realized it was too long of a movie and made his scenes just retarded) was in this  and all the other big names I thought this would be so awesome. I was wrong!<br /><br />First I didn't realize it was 2 Hours!  Fine if a movie is well made--but two hours of the same thing OVER AND OVER!  Not good.<br /><br />Colin was terrible.  I mean I have seen people in plays on campus with no money coming to them do better.  I just didn't feel him as an actor. And the hair...two hours of that was not good...it looked too fake and bleached.  I know they didn't have bleach then!<br /><br />The jumping around was just redundant after a while.  The fight scenes LONG and BORING!  Not well thought out!  And the other big names Jolie and Hopkins didn't shine either.  What happened to them?!  I just don't have anything good to say about this movie.  Okay I will admitt the end like the last 15 or so minutes where everyone dies was good.  I am not sure if it was because I knew it would be over or if I really did like it.  I don't want to see it again to find out.<br /><br />I can't take back the 2 hours that I lost of my life.  But I can help to save another person from wasting their time.  If you really want to see it.  Wait until DVD or go when you are so bored you don't mind losing some of your life to a movie.</p></body></html>

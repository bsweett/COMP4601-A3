<meta name="summary" content="First Class Action Film for Guys (or Gals who like action movies)"></head><body><p>This movie had been recommended to me by my grandson as one of the best movies he had ever seen; after watching this movie with my wife I can see why he said that. My wife on the other hand decided she never wanted to see it again.<br /><br />I found the movie held my interest all the way through and provided the gratifying ending that these movies can often have. The surround sound and picture were convincing and the dialog was easily understood.<br /><br />The picture may go a little over the top with its painting of the villains as totally without any redeeming qualities. The demise of the villains as they are picked off one by one is, however, done with satisfying thoroughness.<br /><br />It winds up being an exciting action film that provides a lot of sound and fury; a fun time for the action movie fan (either guy or gal)!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Insult on Precinct 13"></head><body><p>Hard to come anywhere close to Carpenter's original Assault on Precinct 13, but of course somebody had to try.  Also not really sure why this high octane American caper was handed over to a relatively inexperienced French director.  Not that Jean-Francois Richet did a horrible job, but this script is sprayed with a ridiculous amount of plot holes and ludicrous developments.  However, this remake does boast an all-star cast and a sufficient budget (30 mil), so it's not a total waste.  Plus there are enough thrills injected here to get all of you action junkie's blood boiling.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke plays Sgt. Jake Roenick, a battle tested cop who is still suffering from emotional trauma acquired on the job.  He's given a safe desk job at an old Detroit precinct that is in the process of closing.  So Jake and a group of friends/coworkers settle in to prepare for a little shindig.  But the night is about to get much more exciting, and not just because it happens to be New Years Eve.<br /><br />Due to a snow storm, a bus transferring a few prisoners is forced to make an unexpected stop.  Amongst the dangerous cargo happens to be the notorious crime boss Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne).  Believe me, he's one bad dude.  Anyway, before long the station in under heavy attack, with Bishop the supposed target.<br /><br />(MINOR SPOILER)<br />At first you think it's probably some gangsters looking to free their boss.  But no, it's actually some dirty cops that don't want Mr. Bishop to rat them out in court (not really a spoiler--that fact is revealed early in the movie).  So the cops and the crooks are forced to momentarily teamup in order to stave off these attacks.  The action is now set to get fast and violent.  Only problem is you gotta watch out for the wayward casualties of logic.<br /><br />Like annoying plot holes and such...where do I begin?<br />-bus transfer of a famous kingpin on a snowy New Years Eve night in the Motor City?<br />-sick criminal passenger is enough to change destination?<br />-cell phones, radios, telephones not working at station?<br />-how many psychiatrists work at the police department (on New Years Eve no less)?<br />-why would cops launch a "secret" attack on a precinct?  Wait til he is transferred maybe?<br /><br />But that's not to say this film is all bad.  Like I mentioned before, it has some pretty solid action stunts and gripping thrills.  There is a decent amount of tension as you anticipate loyalties evaporating at any second between the newly formed team.  Even though the story itself is a little hard to swallow, the cast makes you forget much of this.  The lead men are both in roles that seem to totally fit their personas.  Hawke as the heroic, charismatic, smart-aleck cop with deep seeded issues.  Fishburne is also great as the no-nonsense gangster that has a commanding presence.  There are other actors that give stellar performances, such as Maria Bello, John Leguizamo, Ja Rule, and Brian Dennehy.<br /><br />All in all, this ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is watchable but highly inferior to Carpenter's original.  2.5 stars.</p></body></html>

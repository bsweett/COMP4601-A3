The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. It's about how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now if you know what you're worth, go out and get what your worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!"<br />-Rocky.<br /><br />So this movie... is not too bad, actually. Rocky is an old dog now, still got some good mileage left, but clearly he has taken his hits, and then some. In fact he seems to be pretty much done, his glory days long since past. But of coarse we know he's got some fight left in him and watching him pull himself up by his boots straps like the all American hero is, get back into shape and get into that ring one last time(?) you may actually feel respect for this character and enjoy the film. The greatest moment comes when his son shows up and Rocky delievers a truly inspired speech that serves as the message of the film. Stallone made a decent film and heartfelt send-off for Rocky.</p></body></html>

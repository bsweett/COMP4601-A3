<meta name="summary" content="Dude, this is how to make a movie"></head><body><p>To give away the plot to THE BIG LEBOWSKI would be criminal bordering on cruel.  Having said that, the plot is of almost secondary importance to one's enjoyment of this film.  What's most interesting is the way the story is told.  This is the movie your stoned roommate could've written, if only he knew a damn thing about dialogue, casting, and, oh yes, directing.  <p>The characters here are rich, complex, and finely balanced against one another.  Watching them work off each other is to invite yourself to see the movie countless times to catch every nuance of their performance.<p>This is no accident of good lighting, nor happenstance of the editing room.  It is the explicit design of the brothers Cohen, who must now surely be considered auteur.  Just as in FARGO and RAISING ARIZONA, they here continue to prove their ability to create not just a story but an environment.  Theirs is direction by immersion, not merely by camera angle.  <p>Anyone looking for lessons on how to write mesmerizing dialogue, how to create whole worlds without delving into the realm of fantasy or science fiction, would do well to start here.  <p>But then again so would anyone just wishing to have a great time at the movies.<p>[PARENTAL NOTES: Take the "not-for-sale to persons under 18" seriously.  The entire basis of the film is not likely to be one many parents will want their children to enjoy without supervision.  It's not that it glorifies a particular drug-based lifestyle, really. ?But many parents would want to discuss the film with their children just to reinforce the fact that this *is* a work of fiction.]<p>[DVD NOTES: There's not as much on this DVD as there should be, really.  But the 30-minute making-of featurette makes it well worth purchasing over the VHS edition.]</p></body></html>

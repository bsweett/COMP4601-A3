Several franchises have been successfully established within this revived genre, some standouts would be the 'Spiderman' movies, "Fantastic Four", "Batman Begins", and the 'Blade' trilogy.  One franchise has stood out from all the others by taking the focus of the comic book film away from being only on a few key characters, instead focused on an entire team of heroes.  This set of movies is of course the 'X-Men' franchise.  After 2 highly successful trips to the box office with "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United" (both with Bryan Singer at the helm), Fox Studios decided to return to the world of mutants to wrap up their superhero trilogy.  With this decision made the execs at Fox immediately began working on deals with the cast and with director Bryan Singer; the entire cast returned for this supposed 'final' installment into the 'X-Men' franchise, but sadly director Bryan Singer was enticed to jump ship and head to Warner Brothers to direct another little-known superhero movie called "Superman Returns".  With the cast signed and the director M.I.A., Fox scrambled to find a replacement, leaving many to be skeptical about the quality of the film's script, because Bryan Singer had directed the first two movies and suddenly jumped ship, is it possible that the reason for this change of heart was because of a poorly written script?  The answer would, in the end, turn out to be no.  The reason Singer left the series he had started was simply that he had always wanted to direct a 'Superman' movie, and he had an opportunity that he couldn't pass up.  So to replace Singer, Fox chose veteran director Brett Ratner ("Rush Hour 1 & 2" and "Red Dragon").  The decision to have Ratner at the helm of such a high profile movie that was to serve as the final chapter in an incredible trilogy, caused many to be uneasy, especially since Ratner had at one point been picked by Warner Brothers to direct the newest 'Superman' movie, but in the end the movie was released and Ratner quickly showed all the nay-sayers that he was the right replacement for the job.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" begins with the creation of a new 'cure' for mutancy, allowing those beings with powers to choose whether they wanted to keep their powers and remain mutants or take the cure and become normal human beings.  This 'cure' quickly becomes a focus for the mutant race, and becomes central to the war that is brewing between Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellan) 'Brotherhood of Mutants' and Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men.  With mutants being divided as to how to choose regarding the topic of the cure, the battle lines are quickly being drawn, and the war is about to begin!<br /><br />Brett Ratner chose wisely (in my opinion) to not focus on a story dealing solely with the 'cure' for mutants, but mixing it with the ramifications of the resolution to "X2: X-Men United" when Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) became the 'Phoenix'.  This provided some very intense moments for the cast especially for Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine, as he is being forced to choose whether to fight against the woman he loves, possessed as she is by the Phoenix, or allow her to destroy the only people he's ever been able to call friends and family, the X-Men.  The cast, as they have been in the previous installments, was amazing, even the newcomers Kelsey Grammer (Beast), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ben Foster (Angel) fit right in, as if they'd been members of the cast since the first movie.  The action, I would have to say, is the most intense out of all the 'X-Men' movies, it is so intense and fast-paced that you actually have to see everything more than once to fully take it all in.  The special effects work is by far the best out of the franchise as well, not that the first 2 movies were anything to sneeze at, but the moving of the Golden Gate Bridge alone is worth the price of admission.  Many critics, and even some fans, felt that the movie lacked in story, and that the film should have focused solely on Jean Grey becoming the Dark Phoenix, as I said before I disagree with this sentiment on the grounds that there have been two previous films to establish all the backstory needed, making more room for bigger and more explosive action than you had seen prior.  Generally speaking a trilogy's third part serves as a tying up of all the loose ends that had been left over from previous installments and to really up the stakes for the main characters, and in this "X-Men: The Last Stand" succeeds in a most impressive way!  Could there have been more story, sure there's always room for more, but it doesn't hurt the movie by not having the extra exposition, in fact it made the movie feel tighter because it was simply building off of the previous two and not really looking to expand the story all that much, but really just trying to wrap things up, which is the point of a final part in a trilogy.  But no matter what I say or any other critics say about this movie, in the end it's all about what you think of the movie, agree or disagree, it's your opinion that matters on whether you like the movie or not, we're just here to help by providing our feedback.  So, sit back, relax, and enjoy this 'final' installment in the 'X-Men' movie franchise.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.</p></body></html>

Her death was a tragedy and millions mourned.  Perhaps an inferior film would've focused more on her legacy and the behind the scenes feelings that Queen Elizabeth II had regarding The Princess of Wales.  But such expression on film is probably beyond reality as the Queen is by no means a visually emotional person.  Her opinions are more of an enigma and much of that is due to her discipline as Queen.  That is why the story of the interactions between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II on how Diana's death should be treated is worth telling the way it has been here.  I don't think I came to that conclusion until half way through the movie, so I found it to be a very compelling film.<br /><br />It opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) winning the general election for Prime Minister.  Blair was of course an advocate to modernize the country so his early interactions with the Queen (Helen Mirren) were guarded right from the very beginning.  Princess Diana is soon killed in car wreck while being chased by paparazzi and Tony Blair delivers a speech that coins the title "the People's Princess" for Diana.  The Queen of course notes that Diana is technically no longer royalty as she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier.  She believes that the handling of Diana's funeral is to be a private affair and expresses this to Blair.  The result is of course a solid exploration of media hysteria, the Queen's devotion to her vows, and the contemporary dynamics of Royalty for better or worse.  All of these things are certainly elements I knew little about, at least to the extent it is observed here. I'm sure there are inaccuracies somewhere in this picture but not enough for me to pick up on.<br /><br />There are four things that make this film exceptional.  Director Stephen Frears (the Grifters, Dirty Pretty Things) and screenplay writer Peter Morgan (The Last King of Scotland) did an outstanding job in their respective roles.  There is no question that creating a convincing portrayal of this story is no easy task but they managed to pull it off.  The other two items are the performances by Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as the Queen.  Sheen was a bit overshadowed by Mirren's performance but he is definitely great.  Mirren's acting on the other hand was universally hyped as the best performance of 2006.  Having seen the film well after the hype and awards I was certainly prepared to be critical of anything but there is no question about it, Mirren was outstanding and deserved her many glowing reviews, standing ovations, and awards.  The Queen is not necessarily written to be likable but she is still the focus of the film and Mirren takes on the task of making her enjoyable to watch and even to some degree relatable.<br /><br />The Queen is a movie that some people will find slow, it is hardcore drama within a historical context that some will find less entertaining without a certain degree of back story.  If you found interest in what happened ten years ago in the aftermath of Diana's death then you will likely enjoy this film tremendously.  If for some reason that isn't your thing then you may want to take heed.</p></body></html>

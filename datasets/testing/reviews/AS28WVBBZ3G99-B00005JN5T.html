The shaky truce between ex-CIA mastermind Jack (DeNiro) and would-be son-in-law, male nurse, Greg (Stiller) will be tested. Further, the emotionally distant Burns are about to meet touchy-feely aging boomers Bernie and Roz (Hoffman and Streisand). In the middle of it all, peacemaker and arbiter Dina, Mrs. Burns, finally has enough and puts her foot down.<br /><br />There are many chuckles in this movie; DeNiro, Streisand, and Hoffman play their roles with gleeful relish. The bonus features confirm what the audience suspects - the stars really had fun shooting this movie. The playfulness among them just shines.<br /><br />Inside the circle of talent, the four parents play like kids in a sandbox as Stiller watches from outside. All-in-all, this movie is fun and enjoyable. There is little to take seriously and mercifully, they don't.</p></body></html>

The story is amusing, and the dancing is infectious.  The actors seem to be having so much fun, the audience just can't resist.  If you love movies, you can't miss Singin' In The Rain.  It's just wonderful.  The extras are great on this DVD.  The commentary is one of the best I've ever listened to.  Just plain buy this DVD.</p></body></html>

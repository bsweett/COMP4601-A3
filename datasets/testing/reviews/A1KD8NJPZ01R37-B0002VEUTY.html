YES!!"></head><body><p>When I first walked away from this movie, I thought: "that was pretty cool, much better than Pitch Black" but nothing of greatness. But I began to daydream about the story and proceeded to watch it another 3 times in the following days. The more I think about it, the more I can appreciate this movie as a Gem.<br /><br />Of course it does lack in certain areas (it's a "VinDiesel flick" after all), but it's an extremely ambitious story, and I give them a 9 for the effort. They went all-out with the Production Value and the story is an absolute masterpiece. The  Baroque imagery of these crusading death zealots, the realism of the sci-fi, the visuals of New Mecca, and Vin is actually not-bad as the anti-hero. There are so many great things about this movie. My only complaint is that the history behind the Necromongers is too brushed-over in the movie. The Special Features explain alot about their interesting evolution and mission.<br /><br />Totally worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke star as an unlikely set of brothers, both of whom are having money problems.  Hoffman devises a plan to help them both get some cash - not surprisingly, the plan turns sour.  The rest of the movie concerns the fallout of their actions.  The plot jumps back and forth in time and is told from multiple perspectives; there are also some nifty plot twists, the biggest of which is revealed very early in the movie.<br /><br />During the 1970s and early 1980s, Sidney Lumet directed a number of great movies focusing on big city corruption (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Network, Prince of the City).  He got off track afterwards, only rarely scoring with a moderate critical hit (Running on Empty, Night Falls on Manhattan).  By returning to his theme of the evil in seemingly good New Yorkers, Lumet rises to his earlier directing glory - "Before the Devil" is easily his best work since 1982's "The Verdict."  He's aided by a stellar cast, which includes Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei, who is so often under-used in films.<br /><br />Many of the biggest critical hits of 2007 explored dark themes - "No Country for Old Men," "American Gangster," "Eastern Promises," and "There Will Be Blood."  This film can hold its own against these heavyweights; unfortunately, "Before the Devil" was criminally neglected during awards season, scoring only a few wins from minor film critic societies.  Hopefully on DVD it can reach a far wider audience.</p></body></html>

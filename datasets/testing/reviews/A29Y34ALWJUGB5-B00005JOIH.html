Munich is this type of film. Though named for the events that happened in 1972 Olympic Games, Munich follows not only what happened to the Israeli athletes but the reciprocation as well. Essentially, it turns into one man's story to fight for a country he believes in as a Jew and an Israeli, yet finds himself horrified by what he and his comrades have done and what they had done to them.<br /><br />What hit me immediately about this film was the attempt Steven Spielberg made to try and keep his film culturally neutral. Though I think he failed, he did make an effort, which I have to appreciate as someone who has very little tolerance for racism. Movies such as this can create a stir, especially when they are as successful as Munich was, and creating a deeper sense of hatred between the two opposing cultures in this movie is something that definitely would have ruined the experience for me. So, though at times he slipped a little, Steven Spielberg did a great job at putting a human in all the roles, and not making monsters out of a culture we don't understand.<br /><br />That leads me to the film itself, which was done to perfection. Steven Spielberg still is the greatest director out there, and shows that yet again with Munich. This is one tense film, starting early and only occasionally giving us breathers. Spielberg also did a lot to make the characters likable, despite the fact that they were political assassins. This movie plays out in stages, starting of course with the actual taking of the hostages in Munich, moving into the political battles of how best to get revenge for the massacre, and finally the undertaking of that revenge. The first two steps pass by rather quickly, and the action and suspense take over in the third step. Here is where the story of Avner begins to unfold, as he leads a group of five assassins--including Avner--who are charged by Golda Mier, the Israeli Prime Minister, to take out the eleven Palestinians who planned the Munich massacre. But as the group begins killing, and they become more and more accustomed to it, things begin to turn bad. Avner must find a way to deal with the hardships of being a family man and an assassin, while also keeping his team together.<br /><br />Though I didn't give this a perfect rating, I still highly recommend this movie to everyone. Steven Spielberg takes his liberties, but all directors do in the end, and this movie never really attempts to be completely truthful. What it does attempt is a possible explanation of closely guarded historical events. And even if you aren't interested in learning, this is still a great action movie filled with lots of suspense.</p></body></html>

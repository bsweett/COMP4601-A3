<meta name="summary" content="a deeply powerful movie.....Don Cheadle is flawless"></head><body><p>Don Cheadle (Out Of Sight, Oceans 11 and 12) stars as Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who saves 1,200 Rwandian people in 1994 in his hotel from a fued between Hutus because they want all the Tutsis gone. Cheadle races to save his family and the people around him in order to survive this massacre.This powerful, intense and true story hits you hard...it hits you at the core. A flawless performance by Cheadle giving him his best. Joaquin Pheonix (Ladder 49, The Village) stars as a camera man for the press, Nick Nolte (The Hulk, I Love Trouble) stars as a U.N. general and Jean Reno (Leon:The Professional, Godzilla 1998) also stars. I recommend this movie highly and when I mean highly...I mean highly. A masterpiece and one of 2004's best...a truly deep experience.</p></body></html>

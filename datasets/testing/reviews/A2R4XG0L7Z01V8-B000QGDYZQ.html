<meta name="summary" content="He was going to cheat, so run him over!!!"></head><body><p>What initially attracted me to this movie, as always, was Sandra Bullock. In my eyes, she can do no wrong - apart from in the very beginning, when she was a struggling actress. Fire On The Amazon anybody? And also, Julian McMahon, more known to me as Cole from Charmed stars in it. He also gets wet in a shower. Woohoo!!!<br /><br />But the film was just not that good. I saw the ending coming. (What's so wrong with a Hollywood ending now and again?) I disagree with some other reviewers though, who's mentioned the finale was sloppy etc. I LOVED the ending, for me quite possibly the best part of the movie. (For all you cynics out there, not just because it was nearly over!) It was a nailbiting finale, but the right thing in the end happened.<br /><br />The whole plot was quite dodgy, and to anyone who quite simply can't keep track of time, it's all over the place. You have to pay attention, just to find out what day you're on, and whether Julian McMahon is actually alive or dead in this sequence. The whole affair subplot (he didn't, but he was going to, which was glaringly obvious) didn't quite fit in. He was going to cheat, he was considering cheating, isn't it the whole point that she should have kicked his butt out the door anyway? Never mind ran him over herself! And the object of his affections, is as usual, blonde, busty, young, pert, etc.<br /><br />The supporting cast are not worth my time mentioning, and Sandy & Julian are desperately trying to hold the film together, and apart from a really tender scene in the shower (Sandy fully clothed unfortunately for all her male fans), which did bring a tear to the eye, there's not much of a connection or chemistry between the pair of actors. Dare I say it, after seeing him in five seasons of Charmed, Julian is actually sleepwalking through the role.<br /><br />Over all, an interesting movie, if you're interested in premonitions etc, but messily put together and dire extras. And why does the Blu Ray edition have a better cover than this bland one????</p></body></html>

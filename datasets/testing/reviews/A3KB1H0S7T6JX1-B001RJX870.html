<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Downfall, is a movie describing the last days of the German High Command prior to the fall of Berlin in the Spring of 1945.<br />The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!<br />Bruno Ganz, Alexandra Maria Lara, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.<br />The setting, the dialogues, the special effects, the music, and the costumes are all excellent!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, let alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for WWII enthusiasts.</p></body></html>

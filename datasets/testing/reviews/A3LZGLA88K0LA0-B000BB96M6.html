However, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp give so much life and "weirdness" to the Roald Dahl classic that I found myself hopelessly involved in this morality tale of greed and excess.  Although Depp is reminiscent of Michael Jackson with his pasty white face and effeminate demeanor, he infuses Willy with a dark side, which the screenwriters explain by showing us his repressed childhood (with a nice turn from Christopher Lee as his dentist father).  Add the gorgeous set pieces, the absurdly entertaining musical numbers by Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas and Depp's delightfully warped performance, and you have one strange and enjoyable movie.  The child actors are wonderful, especially Freddie Highmore as the titular Charlie and WINN DIXIE'S Annasophia Robb as the bubble gum chewing Violet.  David Kelly as grandpa and Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor as Charlie's parents are great too.  The musical score by Burton stalwart Danny Elfman is delightful; Elfman even does the singing for the Oompa Loompa songs with lyrics by the book's author, Dahl.  With no slant on Gene Wilder's original Willy, I found this movie much more enjoyable and visually stunning.</p></body></html>

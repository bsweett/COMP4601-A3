<meta name="summary" content=""Road Warrior" on Foot"></head><body><p>This one is a chore to sit through.<br /><br />It is a pedestrian "Road Warrior," in all senses.<br /><br />Two great actors--Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman--are utterly wasted on this near-plotless and eminently pointless mess.<br /><br />Recycling every stale post-apocalypse cliche, the movie adds nothing to the genre, and is DULL.<br /><br />The pacing is glacial. Scene after scene is of people walking, alone, and pausing. Camera-zoom: voila, nothing happens.<br /><br />The scenery is unbelievable; apparently they spent all their money on actors and had none left for special effects. The CGI is bargain-basement and looks like the painted backdrop in a high school play.<br /><br />The lighting is sepia. This isn't really a color movie. This is a brown-and-white movie. Yes, I know the post-apocalypse world is supposed to be bleached and irradiated and scorched (this is why everyone has to wear sunglasses), but the brown tone just makes everything seem out of focus.<br /><br />Denzel Washington underacts. He is stoical to the point of somnolent. Even when he fights (which is a lot), he seems to be just going through the motions. By the way, in the many-on-one fight scenes (which are many), each bad guy carefully waits his turn to be stabbed or gored or pierced or otherwise impaled; none of them has the brilliant idea of ganging up.<br /><br />Gary Oldman overacts. This is painful to watch. He chews more scenery than Al Pacino at his worst.<br /><br />But nothing helps.<br /><br />A dog. A dull dog.</p></body></html>

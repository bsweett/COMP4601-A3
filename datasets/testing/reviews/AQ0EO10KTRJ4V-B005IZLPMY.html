<meta name="summary" content="Not perfect, but one of the better Marvel Hero movies"></head><body><p>I was surprised, but I liked this better than some of the Marvel Hero movies.<br /><br />Growing up, I was more of an Iron Man fan, the first film was pretty good  but the 2nd Iron Man movie was horrible.<br />I wish they had not screwed up Tony Stark's character and turned him into a sarcastic one-liner smartass instead of the troubled character he was in the comic.<br /><br />The Hulk movies were both pretty bad.<br /><br />Thor was OK.<br /><br />Ghost Rider was not too good.<br /><br />I liked the nostalgia of the 1940's Captain America.<br />Some editing and story development seemed chopped and rushed even at over 2 hours.<br /><br />But they successfully integrated all the classic elements of the Captain America character.<br /><br />I wish there was a little less camp .... it went a bit into "cheesy" at times.<br />This has nothing to do with the 40's time period ............ the cheese I refer to was an occasional tendency to get a little too carried away with witty humor and a "cuteness".<br /><br />So in the final analysis of Marvel hero films so far, I am adding the following to my DVD collection ........<br /><br />Iron Man # 1  (not # 2)<br />Captain America<br />Thor<br />Spider Man # 1<br /><br />Not Ghost Rider, not Hulk.<br />I don't have X-Men either.  These were done Okay, but for some reason, I never was interested in X-men in comics or the movies.<br />Not Fantastic Four.<br />Not Daredevil</p></body></html>

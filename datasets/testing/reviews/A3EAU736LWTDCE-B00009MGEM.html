<meta name="summary" content="lacked originality, and good acting"></head><body><p>I love robs music, and I liked this movie, but did not love it.<br />First, Mr. Zombie claims he will revolutionize the genre, and talks how clich&eacute; horror movies have become. I thought this was the most clich&eacute; movie I ever seen. examples: the car not starting, the girl tripping and falling when the bad guy chases her.<br />  This is also the most [copy cat] movie I have ever seen: it was the Texas chainsaw massacre to a tee! some compare it to this movie, but I say its almost exact. You have a morbid red-neck family, that is all working together to kill people, Chandelier made of bone, main character wares a dead skin mask, he even looks like the guy from Texas chainsaw massacre 2 (the one with the light hair and a cowboy hat)<br />  The acting is very corny, and cheesy, bad acting! plus some of the worst picture flashing, grainy editing ever!<br />  And finally, the ending just about ruins this movie<br />I would have given this higher rating if it wasn't for the lack of originality...good blood scenes though!!</p></body></html>

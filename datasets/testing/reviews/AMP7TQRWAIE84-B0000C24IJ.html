The ones I liked the most (save for the guy that plays Brenda's crazy, crazy brother in Six Feet Under) end up surviving with scratches, bruises and twisted nightmares as memories.<br /><br />To be honest, this movie was one of the most disturbing that I've ever had the chance to view. Deformities aplenty, chaos everywhere you turn and blood, blood, blood is running along the ground again...<br /><br />The ending was nice but nearly everyone dies...<br /><br />Cover Art: B+<br />Dialogue: B-<br />Characters: B+<br />Story: B-<br />Scares: B+<br />Length: A-<br />Overall: B<br /><br />4 stars.</p></body></html>

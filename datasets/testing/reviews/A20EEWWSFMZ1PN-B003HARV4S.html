They are forcibly separated. Destined to meet again in the future as Edward Norton and Jessica Biel, their actions may have an effect of the future history of Europe.<br /><br />I guess as an audience we are jaded with the onslaught of ghost stories and "seeing dead people" that the story and outcome is pretty much predictable, not that anyone took too much effort to hide.  At least a fact or a butler did not pop out of the closet at the last minute.<br /><br />However the presentation was excellent with the film having a slight flicker gives a hand cranked quality to it. The story is told in third person by Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti.) The music that accompanies the film was by Philip Glass.  Once again Rufus Sewell (Fortinbras "Hamlet -1996") does an excellent portrayal of Crown Prince Leopold.</p></body></html>

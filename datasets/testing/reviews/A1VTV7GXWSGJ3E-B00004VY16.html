<meta name="summary" content="A fun ride that doesn't take itself too seriously!"></head><body><p>This was such a fun movie to watch. I can remember when I first heard Brendan Fraser (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304711867">George of the Jungle</a>) was starring in it I questioned whether I wanted to see it but I am SO glad I did. As good as it is on a small screen it was outstanding to watch on the large. Even though it's barely over two hours you almost left the theater exhausted.<br /><br />Fraser plays fortune hunter Rick O'Connell, a man motivated by treasure but also very loyal to his friends & partners. Rachel Weisz (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C65Z1G">The Constant Gardener (Widescreen Edition)</a>) plays Evie, a librarian whose specialty is ancient Egyptian artifacts. John Hannah (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305210411">Sliding Doors</a>) plays her brother Jonathan, a less than scrupulous want-to-be archeologist/fortune-hunter who, contrary to a review in the New Yorker Magazine, is not a "dim but cowardly..." character. To me, Hannah's portrayal of Jonathan is one of the surprising gems of the film. Always looking for the quick-fix but willing to stand up for his sister. But the one character that steals almost every scene he's in is Arnold Vosloo's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MZHW40">Blood Diamond (Widescreen Edition)</a>) "Imhotep", otherwise known as the mummy.<br /><br />The premise is Evie (with a little not-so-legal help from her brother) discovers the location of the lost treasure city of Hamunaptra. Upon arriving she reads from the "book of the dead", releasing the mummy, who plans to resurrect his lost love and then pretty much rain disaster over the whole world. And of course, he needs to sacrifice Evie to do it. It's up to O'Connell & Jonathan with help from a descendent of the ancient Pharaoh guards to rescue her and kill the Mummy before he can unleash his terror.<br /><br />There are many things to like here. The actors play off each other wonderfully. The plot, while hokey at times is a blast to follow, especially because the filmmakers never take it too seriously. The special effects are outstanding, not only for 1999 standards, but holds up well even now. And the soundtrack is a perfect fit, never over-powering a scene. Overall, just a great film to escape into for two hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sequel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KN7BIG">The Mummy Returns [HD DVD</a>]) never lived up to this film. Although it used the same blueprint, the plot quickly slipped from unbelievable (OK for this type of film) to ludicrous (a death sentence). But with the new film (The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor  [Blu-ray]) being released this summer I am hopeful for a return to greatness, or at least a return to enjoyability. My only reservation is that Rachel Wiesz was unable to reprise her role as Evie. Let's hope her replacement, Maria Bello (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTRKE">World Trade Center (Widescreen Edition)</a>), is as good.</p></body></html>

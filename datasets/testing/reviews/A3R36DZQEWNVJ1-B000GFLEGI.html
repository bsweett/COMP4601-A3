<meta name="summary" content="It's good that Romero is still making movies, but the 4th installment is a let down"></head><body><p>After about 20 years since the last DEAD movie came out which was Day of The Dead which I didnt care for, Land of the Dead was a notch higher then that one but it really didnt survive in my mind. Simon Baker (The Ring Two, Tv's The Guardian) plays Riley, a man who is working for head honcho Kaufman, played by none other then Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Blue Velvet). The zombies have become vast and by the millions and the surviving ones are protected within a safe zone but that doesnt stop the zombies from gaining a slight of knowledge as they figure out how to use guns and other weapons including gas pumps and the zombies head for the safe zone. Baker's second in command Cholo, played by John Leguizamo (Cronicas, Empire), steals Baker's armored gun ready truck. Baker meets along the way a former hooker played by Asia Argento (Scarlet Diva, New Rose Hotel). Then Hopper wants Baker to go find Leguizamo, kill him and bring back "his" truck. But things vastly change but Baker decides he wants to rescue other people still trapped within the safe zone walls. It has that good old Romero touch to it but it kinda gets boring after awhile though watchable. Hopper is Hopper and Leguizamo is Leguizamo. Argento is always hot no matter what and Baker gives a good performance. Also starring Robert Joy (Joe Somebody) who plays Charlie. Look fast for horror makeup guy Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn, Dawn Of The Dead) as a zombie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, disjointed."></head><body><p>I really enjoyed the movie.  It creeped me out and scared me which is why I watch horror movies in the first place.<br /><br />But it was edited in a weird fashion and we all had trouble figuring out what in the heck was going on as it began.  We kept backing up and replaying scenes too.  There was not enough character development.  I wanted to see more of Sarah Michelle Gellar's character "Karen".  I enjoyed watching her figure out the history of the house.</p></body></html>

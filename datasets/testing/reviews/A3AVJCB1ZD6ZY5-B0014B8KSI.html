That's what Michael Clayton (Clooney) tells a client of his firm who's just committed hit-and-run in the middle of the night. He finds the man a criminal attorney and drives off into the night--only to stop briefly by the side of the road to see some horses and get his car blown up.<br /><br />Next, we flash back to 4 days later.  Michael's called to Milwaukee where one of the best litigators in the firm Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has gone off his bipolar medication and had a meltdown during plaintiff depositions to the point of running around naked in the snow.  Edens is the lead attorney for their firm in defending UNorth, a huge chemical conglomerate that has spent 6 years and 50 million dollars in legal fees in defense of farmer's claims that their pesticide is toxic. It's up to Michael to clean up the mess--hopefully get Arthur back on his meds and functioning so the case can proceed.<br /><br />From there, the film takes us back forward over the next five days--to the car bombing--and beyond to the end.<br /><br />Time changes in any kind of media are always difficult.  For my companion and I, knowing the car bombing had taken place already and that Michael survived took a lot of suspense out of the film.  Also, Clooney and Wilkinson are who give the film momentum. The challenge Michael faces in getting help for a man who knows the New York State law about involuntary commitment is compelling--particularly when you realize that Michael really wants to help Eden.  Clooney's portrayal of Michael Clayton is very thorough and convincing--I believe both he and Tom Wilkinson have earned nominations for their roles in this film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the overall film just didn't seem to merit the rave reviews that I have read.  This is one of the few times Rotten Tomatoes and I disagree substantially--if I were awarding numbers, "Michael Clayton" would be a 75.</p></body></html>

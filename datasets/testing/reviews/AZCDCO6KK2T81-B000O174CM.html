<meta name="summary" content="3.5 Stars:  Pleasing but a bit disappointing too."></head><body><p>This film belongs to Hudson and Murphy who are both far more talented than most ever expected.<br /><br />I knew Jennifer Hudson could sing from her stint on American Ido, but I had no idea that was an actress too and I mean a top quality actress capable of pulling off an Academy Award in her very first film.  It's my sincere hope that we will see much more of her in the future even if the roles don't include music.  Hudson is simply an acting find and a visual delight to behold on the screen.  She is a charming as she is talented.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's performance is as much high energy, flamboyant, and satrical as it is subtle, emotional and insightful.  I was floored by his flawless performance in this film and found it a terrible shame that he followed this dynamic performance with the totally distasteful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PATZK6">Norbit</a> which was released just prior to the Academy Awards and in which some believe cost him the Oscar.<br /><br />Members of the Academy are well-known for voting out an actor or actress based upon his or her personality as was the case with Madonna who gave an Oscar-caliber performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304806418">Evita</a>, but was shunned because she was . . . well . . . Madonna, and for voting out an actor or actress based upon a poor follow-up film released the same year and don't want to reward what they may consider a "fluke" performance as with Whoppie Goldberg in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084326">The Color Purple</a> (thankfully she finally got her well-deserved Oscar for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TEP">Ghost</a>) years later.<br /><br />I believe Murphy really blew his Oscar chances for this film because of "Norbit" and that isn't fair, but it was predictable based on past Academy voting tendencies.  I generally believe in not holding things against a performer or a specific performance, but I have to admit that even I have moments of extreme bias, like anyone else, so I can understand how that happens.  This may have been Murphy's only real good shot at an Oscar, but we can always hope that he will be given another juicy role like this one to strut his considerable talents.<br /><br />Beyonce Knowles is no great actress, but she has terrific stage/screen presence that more than compensates for anything that she is lacking in genuine acting talent.  To her credit, I actually had trouble recognizing her early in the film.  I even asked my wife, "Where the hell is Beyonce?  I thought she had a big role in this film."  My wife then pointed her out and I was rather surprised at how well she disappeared into her role.  However, the more I thought about it the more I thought she didn't just "disappear" in what started out as a supporting role, but was simply more out shined and out-acted by Jennifer Hudson.  I don't mean that as an insult to Beyonce or her acting talent as she does have acting talent, but when surrounded by more genuine talent her limitations are clear no matter how beautiful she is, or how gifted she is as a singer, or how engaging she is generally as a stage performer.<br /><br />Moving on to Jamie Foxx I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with his performance in the film.  I can't pinpoint the problem, but I just feel that he felt somewhat out of his league amongst these great female performers.  His performance was simply below what he is capable of delivering, but that doesn't mean he was awful or miscast; he just wasn't at his best.<br /><br />Now, one might question that with all this talent in the film why so many on here haven't given it 5 stars.  I think the problem with this film is with the director.  The film seems disjointed somehow.  The editing isn't very smooth, transitions are weak, and the lack of focus on just who the "stars" are in the film creates an uneven film that works better in clips.  In other words, the sum of the parts don't equal the whole.  That may explain why so many "liked" the film, but didn't "love" it.  It goes down smooth enough, but it never became what it could have become and that feeling is usually the fault of the director.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun and entertaining musical with some strong, dynamic performances, but still somewhat weak for this genre.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chamber of enjoyment--betters the first movie"></head><body><p>Swish and flick--reviewus commencius!  OK, so I've done the theatrical release review a day after its debut.  What's the point of doing the video version, apart from the fact it popped up in my Amazon recommendations?  Maybe it's the fact that I've seen this so many times after it came out on video.<p>Those who have read the book already know the plot of the movie, but for those who haven't, here goes.  In his second year at Hogwarts, Harry hears an ominous voice speaking of blood and killing only audible to him.  Ms. Norris, caretaker Argus Filch's cat, is found petrified.  Colin Greevey, a first-year student and a bug-eyed admirer of Harry, suffers the same fate, as do others.  A blood-scrawled message reads:  "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened.  Enemies of the heir beware."  <p>There's also a new teacher of Dark Arts, Gilderoy Lockhart, a handsome but vain self-promoter whose books are required textbooks for his class.  And as for his classroom competence--don't ask!<p>The continuing antagonism between Harry and his nemesis Draco Malfoy is ratcheted up a notch, as Malfoy becomes Slytherin's Quidditch Seeker.  However, pal Ron Weasley's unassertive personality basically has him as a follower of Harry and Hermione.  And Hermione more than ever proves to be a valuable linchpin of support via magical knowhow.  The friendship between the three become tighter, as does their rapport with Rubeus Hagrid, the giant gamekeeper, especially when Draco hurts Hermione's feelings by calling her a derogatory word.<p>The four main young actors, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Tom Felton (Draco) all show signs of that critical transition of adolescence, that dynamic increase in height and deepening of voices (for the males anyway).  All though have made the characters their own without altering Rowling's book.  Radcliffe in particular is more confident than ever without losing that enthusiastic smile. Emma Watson once again takes top honours as Hermione, prettier and more self-assured than ever.  Tip to Warner Bros:  treat her like royalty and pay her whatever she wants--she's invaluable.<p>Themes in this movie (and the book) include some Nazi overtones of pure-blooded wizards being superior than Muggle-born (those born of non-magical families).  And the Minister of Magic's reactions against pro-pure blood wizard Lucius Malfoy's machinations is reminiscent of Neville Chamberlain appeasing Hitler at Munich.<p>Of the adult actors, Richard Harris-(R.I.P.) (Dumbledore) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) still shine as the supportive providers, but Jason Isaacs steals the show, portraying Lucius Malfoy as a menacing force to be reckoned with, complete in flowing blonde hair, black robes and snakehead cane.  Kenneth Branagh (Lockhart) isn't bad.  Shirley Henderson gets kudos as the snivelling ghost Moaning Myrtle, who gets a laugh once in the movie.<p>CGI effects make filming of the Harry Potter movies good timing, and the fast-paced Quidditch match isn't the same numbing blur of movement that plagues today's action movies.  Face it, had the movie been filmed two decades earlier, the realization of Hogwarts, the Quidditch match, and certain monsters would've looked pathetic using Ray Harryhausen special effects.<p>The Chamber of Secrets tops the original in character development, story, and competent performances.  In terms of content and scenery, the film is slightly darker than the first, but the overly sentimental finale makes up for those moments.  My recommendation is read the books first, then watch the movies.  Both are enjoyable, but read the book and play it out as if you were watching the movie.  It's great that way.<p>Oh yes.  Darker will definitely apply to the third film, The Prisoner of Azkaban, which I will definitely go see on opening day next year.  What about you?  Swish and flick--finite reviewus!</p></body></html>

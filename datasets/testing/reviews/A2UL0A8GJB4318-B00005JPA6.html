<meta name="summary" content="Del Toro Blossoms Into a Cinematic Artist"></head><body><p>It is not very often that one gets to see a filmmaker blossom into greatness.  Scorsese has his "Taxi Driver," Spielberg has his "Jaws" and "Close Encounters of Third Kind," Coppala has "The Godfather" and Nolan has "Memento."  Now director Guillermo Del Toro, who before was one of the most promising talents in the world, has his "Pan's Labyrinth," an achingly and grimly beautiful film.  This is one of those stories where every detail, from the slightest glance, facial twitch and camera move, feels right.  Nothing is forced and setting, character and themes are fully, richly realized.  Set amid the communist insurgency that irritated Franco's fascist government in the aftermath of his victory in the Spanish Civil War, "Pan's" opens in 1944 with young Ofelia (a luminous Ivana Baquero) and her sickened mother (Ariadna Gil, whose eyes haunt with ease) traveling to a Fascist outpost in the Spanish woods, where the sadistic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, quietly and unforgettably menacing) labors to expunge the last of the rebels from the countryside.  Ofelia's mother is very weak from carrying the Captain's baby boy, a burden she takes on to give her daughter and her unborn son the protection that the Captain can offer, although she is not blind to the Captain's special brand of vicious and inhuman violence against opposing communist guerillas.<br /><br />To escape from her new and frightful place alongside the Captain and her emaciated mother, Ofelia retreats into her fairy tales, places of innocence and peace.  But one night, a fairy visits her in her room, leading her to a labyrinth in the woods where an old Faun (Doug Jones) resides and waits.  Jones is a revelation, breathing enormous life into his costumed characters, especially his brief but terrifying turn as the Pale Man, a child-devouring monster who pursues Ofelia in the film's most harrowing scene.  The Faun announces to Ofelia that she is a long lost princess of the underground realm, a place that revels in the magic and power of an earlier age when nature and the spirit were one.  But, to prove that Ofelia still possesses the immortal princess' essence, the Faun lays out three tasks for her that, if completed, will earn her a place beside her ancient father in the underworld.  But the tasks are dangerous and, as they escalate, so does the battle between Vidal and the guerillas and the deterioration of Ofelia's mother.  Fantasy, once Ofelia's refuge, is now as uncertain as the world that surrounds her.<br /><br />At first glance, a film that combines earthy fairy tales a la the Brothers Grimm and period war piece might seem jarring, but Del Toro makes the combination feel effortless.  The two parallel each other perfectly, complementing each other on themes such as Fascist thought and the universal struggle between good and evil.  The rest is just gravy, absolutely, jaw-droppingly gorgeous gravy.  Guillermo Navarro's vivid and fluid cinematography methodically hovers and swirls around searing battle scenes and otherworldly locales with smooth confidence; also, the production design exudes a worn, lived in feel.  But the greatest triumph of the film (other than the stellar writing, acting and directing) is the downright stunning creature designs.  The Faun and the Pale Man are unlike anything that has been seen before, completely original and organic figures seemingly plucked from the realm of dreams and nightmares.  One step on his spindly legs and one flick of his wrist and the Faun has become helplessly endearing.  One frightening upward move of his palms, and the Pale Man becomes one of the most nightmarish figures in cinema history.<br /><br />Put simply, "Pan's Labyrinth" is a masterpiece.  Del Toro has done something that very few filmmakers before him have done, and it demands to be seen and cherished as an example of the best cinema has to offer.</p></body></html>

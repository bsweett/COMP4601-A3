Keanu Reeves, returns, of course, as Neo, The One and possible savior of Zion. Neo is in a coma, which, strangely, doesn't look like a coma because his brain patterns are different than a person in a coma, unfortunately. Laurence Fishburne, is, back as, Morpheus, the man with all the ideas. He believes in Neo, because of what he can do. Carrie-Anne Moss is, of course, back as, Trinity, who would give her life to save Neo. Neo is trapped between the machine world and the real world, unfortunately, by the Merovingian, played again, by Lambert Wilson. The Oracle, this time, played by Mary Alice, replacing the late Gloria Foster, is back, too. As is, Agent Smith, played, with sheer brilliance, by Hugo Weaving, who has never looked better in a performance like this, unfortunately. Niobe, played again, by Jada Pinkett Smith, is back, as well. This is also an appearance by the Architect, played again by, Helmut Bakaitis. The rest of the cast from "The Matrix Reloaded" returns as well, too. This is an brilliant movie with brilliant ideas and thoughts in its brain, a little more than "The Matrix Reloaded". It doesn't have that many fight scenes as its first two processors did, unfortunately, it is brilliant, nonetheless. The score by Don Davis, is a triumph in itself and it is one of the best scores heard this year so far. The directing by The Wachowski Brothers, is superb and dynamic, but it is also brilliant, too. The Costume Design by Kym Barrett is excellent. The Production Design by Owen Patterson is wonderful without compromise. The Cinematography by Bill Pope is superb. The Film Editing by Zach Staenberg is dynamic. The Screenplay, also by, the Wachowski Brothers, is excellent and superb, without compromise. The Visual Effects is brilliant as its first two processors, and it shapes the filmmaking of tomorrow's newest talents as "The Matrix Reloaded" did. Go see this movie now and try to see it again, if possible. It is a visionary achievement that shall be remembered for all time.</p></body></html>

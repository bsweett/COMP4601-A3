<meta name="summary" content="It's CRAZILY SCARY.  + Swift action scenes = A must watch for horror fans"></head><body><p>I rented the original The Crazies about 4 months ago. It's very bad due to bad acting, childish special effects and tiny budget. When I heard about this remake, I was skeptical because most of the time, remakes were a waste of money. After watching  this one at  the theatre, I had to admit I was completely wrong.<br /><br />There were a lot of scary, gory and suspenseful scenes. However, the last 10 minutes were predictable as other films. The action scenes were swift. There's nothing new in the plot. So far, it's the scariest movies I've watched in 2010. It's a must watch for horror fans</p></body></html>

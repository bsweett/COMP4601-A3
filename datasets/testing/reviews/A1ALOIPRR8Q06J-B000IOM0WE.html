<meta name="summary" content="the film version"></head><body><p>As one esteemed critic so aptly put it, "Fux fux sux fux sux sux sux".<br /><br />The animated series that appeared on Liquid Television was cool, especially for it's time. Liquid Television was a good show bringing viewers highly original and entertaining animation. As for the movie, in my opinion they completely blew it. Charlize Theron is talented but wasn't at all right for the part. I thought Carrie-Anne Moss would have been better. The movie wasn't at all like the TV show. The creator of Aeon Flux said upon seeing the movie he "felt helpless, humiliated and sad". They should have stayed true to the TV series and Peter Chung should have had creative input.</p></body></html>

All of the horror movies that come out now only deal with a lot of blood, guts and torturing.  Not knocking that type of movies, but it gets tiring when it's the same thing over and over again.  With "1408," you are given a truly creepy movie that gets into your head, as well as in your soul.  The premise at a glance seems simple and even risks being overly ridiculous if not handled with the greatest of care.<br /><br />Mike Enslin is a writer who likes to take his accounts of so-called "haunted" areas and sell them to the public in his books, however if you really know the man you know that he really doesn't believe in anything.  Still, there is something that drives him to go to each place that claims to be haunted to see if he can have some sort of proof that there is something more to what we simply see everyday.  He gets a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel and on the back it warns him specifically not to go into Room 1408.  Of course, this makes Mike all the more curious, so he sets his sight onto the room.  Not even the manager of the hotel can steer him away with his warnings, as Mike himself says to the manager that he doesn't believe in ghosts or monsters, and even if they did exist that there was no God to protect them from such horrors.  The manager allows Mike to stay in the room after seeing there is no way to tell him otherwise.  What Mike will witness during his stay is the things that nightmares are made of, and it will dish out every single fear he has ever had along with forcing him to revisit a horrible personal tragedy and get to the very bottom of his soul.<br /><br />"1408" not only is a well-made horror movie, but it's also an excellent film over all.  This is a movie that goes to places that a lot of the new horror movies don't go.  The movie is not afraid to get personal and deep while still giving you great scares.  There are times that you may find yourself jumping here and there, but the scare factor is mostly psychological and it'll make you feel uncomfortable in your seat.  You don't have to scream aloud to be frightened.  It's a scream that you keep inside of yourself and take with you when you go to bed, and it lingers in your head no matter how many times you try to shake it off.<br /><br />There are two things that make this movie a success; 1) John Cusack is phenomenal, and dare I say this might be one of his best performances ever, and that is nothing easy considering the fact that he's solo in 90% of the movie.  He has great range as an actor, and this movie showcases all of his emotions and you really feel for him and grow to love him.  2) The emotional human side of the film that's very realistic.  Even though it's been said in reviews and the trailer, I don't want to give it away.  You'll understand when you watch the movie.  These are the two important factors that make the movie work and keep it from being a "goofy horror" flick.<br /><br />The 2-Disc "Collector's Edition" contains some behind the scenes features, both the theatrical and an "Extended Director's Cut" and commentary on the "Director's Cut" version of the film.  I've seen both and I personally prefer the theatrical cut, but it was interesting to see the other version.  In fact, the director, as much as he loves some of the extended scenes and the "alternate ending" that's featured in the "Director's Cut," admits to being very happy with the theatrical version and understanding why some things were better left out or changed (this found on the commentary track with him and the writers).  The ending in the other version is very different from the theatrical, but again I have to say I prefer the version I originally saw the first time.  If you go with the 2-Disc edition, you can view for yourself and see which one you like better.<br /><br />"1408" is one of the few new horror movies that really made an impact on me, and it's a trip worth taking.  It's not one that everyone will like, and some people may not be able to handle some of the dark and depressing themes that the movie ventures into, but if you're sick of the torture flicks and want to see a genuinely creepy movie that'll stay with you, then I highly recommend checking it out.  Definitely goes down as one of my favorite movies of the year. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

Coupled with a rather weak script and wooden direction, the film didn't accomplish its goal at the time, only recently acquiring "cult" status.<br /><br />2004's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" was supposed to do the same thing, and may have accomplished that feat in a mild way, showing that a movie could be created with actors responding to direction while acting on a blue screen set.  Unfortunately, there lies the film's biggest weakness.  The actors seem unsure as to what they are reacting and it shows.  Like such effects-laden predecessors as "Godzilla" and "Spawn," the performers' reactions are either too slow or quirky, revealing the actors' doubts about how they should respond to the director's on-screen intent.<br /><br />Combining cutting-edge computer effects, comic book-like espionage, elements of film noir (in sepia tones, no less), globetrotting daring do, and 1930's set pieces, the film is too over-the-top to be believed.  The producers may have thought they were paying homage to early films but I feel that they borrowed a bit too heavily from the older, and much better, films.<br /><br />Check out the sound effects of The Iron Giant-like robots' laser beams, identical to those produced by the Martian spacecraft in George Pal's "War of the Worlds".  The battles over the skies of Manhattan look like they were lifted from any installment of Max Fleischer's "Superman" shorts of the 1940's.  Didn't Roger Moore have a car that turned into a submarine in 1977's "The Spy Who Loved Me"?  It might not be a car, but Law's plane does a remarkably similar feat.<br /><br />And how many times since 1937's real-life Hindenburg disaster can one see a dirigible explode???<br /><br />Besides the obvious "salutes" to "Metropolis" and "The Wizard of Oz," the film also lifts from "Mars Attacks" and "Jurassic Park".<br /><br />As for the cast, Jude Law is a bit too small in stature and refined to be the "rugged hero" and "savior of the world".  Gwyneth Paltrow tries her best to be "the girl Friday" but she's saddled with lines that are so awful that her drama teacher must be wincing.  She, at least, gets to sing "Over the Rainbow" in the closing credits, and affords herself adequately.  Jolie, sporting a sexy eye patch and form-fitting outfit, gets to make what amounts to an extended cameo.  Her English accent isn't too bad, though.<br /><br />And the credits do state that the estate of Sir Laurence Olivier did approve of his image and voice being used in the film.  Well, I know "Larry" is grimacing in his grave.<br /><br />When I saw the theatrical trailer for the film prior to its release, I wondered what were Law, Paltrow, and Jolie doing in a sci-fi epic.<br /><br />Now that I have viewed the entire film, I'm still wondering.<br /><br />I wonder do they still have the same agent, respectively.</p></body></html>

He swears and cheats the other patients of their money because he really isn't crazy, you see. McMurphy manipulates the nurses to give him cigarettes and fights a good fight against authority. The novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" by Ken Kesey was more vulgar and outrageous than the film, but the film keeps the characters the same. The big chief was hilarious breaking out of the hospital at the end. Nobody could have lifted that sink out of the ground. Gargantuan! Even though patients lose their minds and drool all over the place, the orderlies have to clean up after them. In the end, the big chief cleaned up after McMurphy's mess.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps the best from the Coens"></head><body><p>With "No Country For Old Men" the Coen brothers finally craft a classic for the 00s to match their top contributions to prior decades. ("Blood Simple" and "Fargo," natch.) Though the Coens' films have largely managed to entertain over the past 13 years, the post-"Fargo" era has virtually never achieved the manic brilliance of their first dozen years, and the Coens have inched closer towards becoming the sort of artists that their early critics always claimed they were. (All flash and irony, no humanity.) Interestingly enough, the notoriously idiosyncratic frauteurs revived their stalling careers by saddling their own tendencies and faithfully recreating the work of another prominent artist. This is not to say the Coens have totally excised their own sensibilities, but they have nevertheless produced a work that is impressively faithful to Cormac McCarthy's driven, brutal novel. Though it is impossible to translate McCarthy's florid, allusive prose to the screen, this cinematic adaptation still mirrors the emphasis on texture found therein, and contains as controlled and deliberate a visual style as any thriller. Make no mistake, though few will deny that "No Country For Old Men" displays greater philosophical depth than the average thriller, it is on the purely dramatic level that the film most shines. In short, this is perhaps the best thriller of the past decade, and mandatory viewing for anyone evenly remotely interested in film.<br /><br />Like many classically styled thrillers, "No Country For Old Men" opens with a fairly straightforward premise which is steadily complicated: Shortly after discovering the murderous capabilities of the enigmatic mercenary Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), we are introduced to Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) a Texan good ol' boy who stumbles on a cache of heroin along with nearly $2,000,000 from a drug deal turned bloodbath. After absconding with the cash, however, Moss's guilty conscience causes him to return to the scene to assist a dying man, where he is assailed by some cartel members. With his identity uncovered, Moss must leave behind his young wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) and flee with both the cartels and the mysterious Chigurh on his trail, while the local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to neutralize the situation before more blood is shed.<br /><br />Put crassly, "No Country For Old Men" plays as a combination of "The Terminator" and "A Simple Plan." The former comparison is particularly apt, as Chigurh is effectively a high-lit T-800. Though human, of course, Chigurh displays no more humanity than Schwarzenegger's machine, and is instead a being of pure will and self-preservation, a self-styled over-man. Bardem's killer is not as philosophical as the novel's version (the speeches are too long for film), but Bardem nevertheless translates the peculiarly surreal, unbelievable character to the physical realm impressively. He doesn't quite look like the literary Chigurh (who is described as vaguely foreign with blue eyes, I think), but who could? Bardem's turn is, naturally, somewhat stiff, but he works through subtle expressions and eye movements, imbuing the character with subtle yet pure malevolence. As good as Bardem is, however, Josh Brolin is better. One relative weakness of the novel was my indifference towards Moss, but Brolin injects the somewhat thinly written character with real humanity and an endearing, simple sense of humor, along with a cunning, quick-witted intelligence rare to rural film characters. Tommy Lee Jones is relative a low point. He's solid, but seems a little more foolish and less dignified than was the novel's Bell, somewhat reflecting the Coens' typical portrayal of small town characters. Finally, in smaller roles we have solid turns from Kelly Macdonald as Moss's sweet but dim wife and Woody Harrelson as an overly cocky colonel-turned-mercenary. (I was skeptical about Harrelson, but he pulls the small role off impressively.)<br /><br />All that said, the camera is the film's true star. "No Country For Old Men" is as purely visual as post-silent films come, with countless scenes filmed in near or complete silence. The movie has no music whatsoever prior to the credits, and is the rare film that must be seen in the theater to emphasize the enormous, endless quiet. The cinematography is always elegant, but this primarily serves to make the sporadic scenes of harsh violence all the more jarring. Nevertheless, the low-key scenes are the heart of the film, and allow the audience to enter the minds of the characters, to feel Moss's unrelenting anxiety as he discovers that he will not have a moment's piece in the foreseeable future. Most thrillers exist only for the climactic scenes, but the Coens impressively divide the intensity throughout the film as a whole, finding the drama in the passing of cars and the eerie quiet in the rural night.<br /><br />All this leads to the film's conclusion, which many, particularly those unfamiliar with the novel, see as pretentious, anticlimactic and nihilistic. While the case can certainly be made, I feel the climax (or lack thereof) works. First: climaxes, particularly in well-crafted films, usually fail to live up to the build, a concern which this deliberately circumvented here. Second, the ending is decidedly thematically important, as it also was in the novel, albeit in somewhat different form. The most significant underlying theme of the novel is chance, the lack of control individuals have over their existing. By denying us the expected conclusion, the film illustrates this principle graphically, denying the characters the confrontation that they drive towards throughout the film. Finally, the conclusion is undeniably bleak, but it isn't forced in this way. Though I prefer dark, violent entertainment, I'm not some self-consciously edgy punk who thinks that nihilistic endings are inherently "real." The bleak ending, however, is justified by the film as a whole; it is inevitable. (This is in contrast to "Million Dollar Baby" and the like, which turn bleak merely to establish their critical bona fides.)<br /><br />Hopefully this will mark a renaissance for the Coens, and perhaps the beginning to decidedly unexpected cinematic success for McCarthy. Unfortunately, "Burn After Reading" is all too similar to most recent Coens work, and we can't yet say how "The Road" and "Blood Meridian" will turn out. (I'm told many like "All the Pretty Horses," though I've never seen nor read it.) Either way, these three individuals are attached to one of the finest films of the 00s.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

This movie features non-stop laughs that will have you rolling on the floor.  I swear, what they said is right about how it has more laughs in one minute than some whole films (Zoolander!).  Okay, I'll admit that the story is pretty nonexistant (there is some nonsense about a satellite and a meteor), but we don't go to Austin Powers movies for the plot, we go for the jokes, and this one has some killers.  I especially enjoyed the opening credits scene with all the celebrity cameos.  Dr. Evil (my hero) is funnier than ever, though its Mini-Me who really steals the show.  Fat Bastard, while crude and gross, has his share of laughs.  But we can't forget Austin himself, now with his father Nigel.  Go see this movie if you want to laugh without having to use your brain for an hour and a half.  You'll love it.</p></body></html>

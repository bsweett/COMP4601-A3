<meta name="summary" content="Looks like the beginning of another successful franchise"></head><body><p>CS Lewis's story of the four Pevensie children's (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, and Anna Popplewell) adventures in the land of Narnia comes to the screen as a big-budget, digital spectacle.  Although the battle, which was summarized in only a few bloodless paragraphs of the novel, takes up a good part of the running time--and, no doubt, the budget--of the film, the tone of the book is largely preserved.  The children are perfectly cast and Narnia portrayed as a generally friendly place, except for occasional appearances by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and her cronies.  I like big battle scenes, so the shift of emphasis to spectacle from character didn't bother me, but strict admirers of the novel may be disappointed.</p></body></html>

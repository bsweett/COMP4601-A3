<meta name="summary" content="A bold presentaion."></head><body><p>'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo', is one of the most talked about book seires these past few years and after reading the first instalment I understand why. It is a captivating white knuckle thriller that really breaks all the rules with bold and sometimes disturbing moments that just keep reading. So when they announced that an American version of the already made Sweedish film was on the way of course I was ready to go.<br /><br />The director David Fincher already was one of my favorite directors and I love his work and of course this time he directed another winner. While there were some differences from the transition of book to film it was a movie that was just as gripping and bold as the pages. The cast was great and I knew that Rooney Mara would do a great job portraying Lisbeth, even getting an academy award nomination. Daniel Craig can do no wrong and even Robin Wright supprised me a little in the role she played as well.<br /><br />I am a bit upset that this film didn't get the box office notice that it truly deserves, but at the same time a film that deals with some very debated topics is not one that the collective film going public would agree upon. I was happy that certain moments as graphic as the pages mentioned did show up on the film. I really hope that the universal concensious will not prevent the next two chapters from hitting the big screen and I hope that Fincher stays on to direct along with the cast and hopefully Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the soundtrack.</p></body></html>

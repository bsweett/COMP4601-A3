If you have seen this movie you need no answer to that question. This story is as compelling as "Moby Dick," and the captain of H.M.S. Surprise is just as driven as Captain Ahab, though generally not mad as was Ahab.<br /><br />The story at first appears to be a classic story of a strategic sea chase between two captains. However, it cannot be, for the pursuer and the pursued frequently change position, and the English pursuer is the weaker of the two opponents. In order to have any chance against an enemy with longer range guns, more speed, and a nearly impenetrable hull, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) will need luck, bravery, and a superb strategy. Fortunately all three will eventually work in his favor, at least sufficiently to make a grand finish to this movie.<br /><br />Three things set this movie apart from its predecessors.<br /><br />First, the detail in this movie is incredibly good. The research into the conditions about a sailing ship of this era was apparently quite extensive as the details in the operation of the ship were numerous. Details regarding the relationships between the officers and crew also appeared quite authentic, recalling from my dim past the book "Two Years Before the Mast." While it would be easy to dismiss the attention to detail, that very detail makes much of this movie a delight to watch.<br /><br />Secondly, the two captains were every bit as crafty as any two captains have ever been portrayed. We only see the results of the French captain's efforts, but we see the result of those efforts on Captain Aubrey, and we realize that Captain Aubrey has met someone with a talent that is at least equal to his own. We have seen similar scenarios in movies such as "The Enemy Below" and "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," and yet in every one of these movies the scenario, while similar, is sufficiently different that you will find the course of the movie and the ending to be different.<br /><br />Third, the special effects benefit from decades of development of computer generated imagery. In the movies of days gone by the special effects would rely heavily on miniature ships floating about in a big pool. In this movie the special effects are so good that, just as in "Jurassic Park," you never know when you are looking at a ship and when you are looking at computer graphics. While there are places where you can guess computer images were used, try not to focus on that aspect too much because it can distract you from the story.<br /><br />Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Captain Aubrey, well supported by a similarly excellent cast. "Master and Commander" received ten nominations for Academy Awards in 2003, and in any other year would likely have won many more awards than the two it won, but "The Return of the King" overshadowed this superb historical fiction. It is gratifying to see such quality in film making. This movie is well worth five stars and then some.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

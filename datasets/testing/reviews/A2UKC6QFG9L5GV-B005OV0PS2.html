<meta name="summary" content="THE BIG LAUGH"></head><body><p>A friend of mine told me not so long ago: "My son watches 'The Big Lebowski' once a week". Well, I don't watch it that often but rather often. It's one of the films that can be watched over and over again and you'll never get bored with it. When I started my DVD collection another friend of mine asked me: "Do you already have 'The Big L.'?" I said no and he continued: "Well, if I were you it'd be the first movie I'd get". And I thought he's right - this is absolutely a flick for all times. If you don't have anything to watch on a sunday evening and there's nothing new in video-renting shop you can always take 'The Big Lebowski' from the shelf and have a guaranteed pleasant evening. By the way I bought it the next day.<br /><br />It's amazing how Coen brothers can combine comedy and criminal film. Their black humor is the best among all that exist in cinema. Every line, every word is a subject of laughter. For a long time you'll be recalling a rug, Vietnam and what happens when you do particular things to a stranger :)<br /><br />'The Big Lebowski' is a true masterpiece of the 90's, and it'll be a jewel in every collection.</p></body></html>

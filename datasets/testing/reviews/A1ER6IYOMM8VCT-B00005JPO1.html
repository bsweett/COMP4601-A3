<meta name="summary" content="NOT COMPLETELY HORRIBLE, BUT LACKS THE MAGIC OF THE TRILOGY!"></head><body><p>Well, we knew they were going to do it, every other movie icon from the  past 30 years has done it, so why not Indiana Jones? It seems like Hollywood had found another way to find box office gold when it decided to do "reunion" films for Rocky, Rambo, John McLain (Die Hard) and now Indiana Jones! It hasn't been a total loss as I did enjoy Rocky Balboa and the new Die Hard films, Rambo only had one good film to begin with, but Indiana Jones had a good run until this new feature film.<br /><br />The film is certainly watchable, but it's so over the top, it's more of a self parody, than a sequel. It just doesn't have the magic of the first three films. This is one time where "bigger is better" does not apply. I'm glad I found this in a bargain bin, because I'm sure I won't watch it very often. For Die Hard fans the DVD transfer is very good and there is a short making of documentary on the single disc.</p></body></html>

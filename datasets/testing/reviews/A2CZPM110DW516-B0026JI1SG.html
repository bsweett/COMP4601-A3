<meta name="summary" content="Improves with each viewing"></head><body><p>At first glance, Clint Eastwood's Oscar winning "Million Dollar Baby" looks like a standard boxing movie until, of course, the devastating climax. But this is a film that grows deeper and more rewarding with each viewing. The deep bond that exists between trainer Frankie Dunn and boxer Maggie Fitzgerald becomes more evident each time you see the film. Dialogue that seems to mean one thing suddenly seems to mean something all together different the second and third time around.<br /><br />The more you see it, the more you also realize that much of the "controversy" concerning the actions of the characters was the result of propagandists who either missed the point or deliberately attempted to mislead the public about the film's "message." But this film's only "message" is that life is a frequently brutal business that sometimes requires making decisions we would rather avoid. "Million Dollar Baby" does not "promote," "endorse," or "condone," but rather "depicts" an act that has deeply disturbing consequences for all involved.<br /><br />The performances are excellent with Hillary Swank commanding the spotlight even when sharing it with her illustrious and legendary co-stars. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are also excellent, as is Jay Baruchel as Danger. Eastwood's subtle score is fine, and Tom Stern's moody cinematography is outstanding, effectively using light and shadow to create moods and to comment on the characters and the action.<br /><br />Brian W.

The plot is uninspired, the acting is pretty good but not exceptional, but the special effects make the film.  The tornado sequences will literally and figuratively blow you away.  Some of the scenes defy credibility (our heroes manage to outrun a monster tornado on foot, yeah, right) but this isn't a movie that begs to be taken seriously; grab the popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.  And just as the real star of &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; was Lee Marvin's drunken horse, so the character who steals &quot;Twister&quot; is a cow caught up in the turbulent winds turning mad somersaults in midair, looking thoroughly bemused.  It's priceless scenes like this one that define the movie and make it so much fun to watch.</p></body></html>

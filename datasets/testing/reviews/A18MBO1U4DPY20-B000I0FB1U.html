<meta name="summary" content="Where did it all go wrong?"></head><body><p>Jack Black remains the great actor he is. The storyline is an absolute joke. I quite liked the kids which quite surprised me cause I hate kids otherwise. There were 2 funny scenes in the movie but overall the movie lacks that "good movie" feel. This is not a must watch and if you don't watch it, don't be too upset about it. A lot of humor in the movie resigns before being delivered and that makes it rather flat. I won't be surprised if you switch this movie off ten minutes into it. Saving grace in the film was the brother-sister relationship. Or was it?<br /><br />Watch if you are a Jack Black fan and MUST watch this film. Otherwise, avoid.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Scariest Movie Ever Has Never Looked Scarier Now In Blu-Ray!"></head><body><p>This may well be the most satisfying blu-ray purchase I have made to date and I wish all future blu-ray releases will be like this.  Like many other film fans out there I face a struggle at times trying to justify the double-dip from the dvd or even the vhs but this release sure made it easy for me.  Firstly, I'm a big fan of digibooks and indeed anything that is as far removed from the usual dvd release as possible.  The content is usually very informative and useful and it is certainly the case here.  Secondly, to have both the Director's Cut AND the Thearetical Release versions here is joyful for the fan (George Lucas try to contain your greed and take note!).  Thirdly, this film has been restored admirably and looks excellent and hence way scarier in 1080p although for some reason the picture quality seemed a little better for the thearetical release as compared with the director's cut and I'm assuming that it's because the missing bits that were added for the latter were poorly preserved and so to fit in with the rest of the frames some extra work was needed that brought the quality down a little as compared with the former version but I'm merely guessing here.<br /><br />The sound quality for both versions though in wonderful DTS HD MA 5.1 surround is simply stunning and certainly beyond reproach.  As to the various cuts argument I personally would have done a different "Reviewer's Cut" although I have to say that the original thearetical version was pretty well done already but I do have some sympathy with Blatty.  For my "Reviewer's Cut" version, I would leave out the "spider on the staircase" scene and perhaps the extended ending with the policeman but I would keep some of the ending like when the priest tells the mother to keep Karas' medal and perhaps just end it a little after that just before the policeman shows up.  I would also keep the staircase dialogue between the exorcists as I do agree with Blatty that it is a key scene and I disagree with Friedkin that it is "understood" or "stating the obvious"; sometimes with filmgoers you need to state the obvious for emphasis and I feel that to be the case here.  I would leave out the additional scene of Karas playing the recording of Regan's normal voice as in that case I feel it was not necessary to show how normal Regan was because I think we get it already from the beginning of the film although I would keep the added footage of the mother talking with the doctors.  There you have it!  This reviewer's cut! But all in all if I had to choose between the two I'd say the Thearetical Version is good as is that is until my Reviewer's Cut is made :-)<br /><br />This film shocked me and when I first saw even the censored version of it years ago as a child I have to say it bothered me no end and led to many a sleepless night but as I grew older and hence better able to see the bigger picture I've come to realise that this is a great love story with many facets to show that Good always triumphs over Evil and that even if it may seem that Evil wreaks all kinds of calamity and havoc and has the upper hand but in the final analysis Good still wins.  In the end, the priest who lost his faith gains redemption through imitating his model Jesus Christ; in taking onto himself all of the evil inhabiting the child and dying for her salvation he does on a smaller scale what Christ did in taking on all the evils of the entire world onto himself and dying for it so that it may be redeemed and live in spiritual freedom again.  Also in the example of Karas and the entire experience I think we can safely say that Regan's mother is no longer an aetheist!  I guess there are no aetheists in foxholes and in demonic possession!  It was very touching watching this transformation of Karas' character from the start of the film to the very end.  For me the most important and most memorable scene of the entire film was the one at the bottom of the stairs after the older priest sends Karas out of the room because he was not cutting it and when the mother asks if Regan was going to die and as if in a Garden of Gethsemane moment Karas steels himself and decides no way!  I'm going to save that child no matter what and just like Jesus going from Gethsamane to his death on the cross Karas goes from the bottom of the stairs up to the room where he dies to save the child.  Beautiful!<br /><br />Next to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JNNDGA">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] this film is a great picture to encourage Christians everywhere.  All the demon succeeded in doing was to give yet another opportunity for Self-Sacrificing Goodness to exhibit itself and bring Hope instead of the Despair that was intended as was so well put by von Sydow in the dialogue on the stairs scene that should have been kept in the original version.<br /><br />Yes, it is still the scariest film ever seen and made scarier with the 1080p and the DTS HD MA 5.1 surround treatment and yet it is among the more hopeful films that I have ever seen as well making this among the top 10 films that I've ever seen as well.<br /><br />Very disturbing if you are seeing it for the first time and I can only imagine how much more of the case that was in the 1970s but if you pay attention to the characters and all the storylines it is also among the most rewarding film experiences that you are likely to have.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!</p></body></html>

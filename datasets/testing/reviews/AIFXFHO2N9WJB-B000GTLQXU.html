Sometimes these remakes prove to be inferior to their source material ("Psycho" and "The Omen" to name a couple), but in some instances they become equals to the originals, or even better than the original.  A very recent addition to the ever-increasing list of remakes would be director Wolfgang Peterson's ("Air Force One" and "Troy") attempt at remaking the classic disaster-type film "Poseidon Adventure" with "Poseidon" starring Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, and Richard Dreyfuss.<br /><br />"Poseidon" takes place during New Year's Eve on the cruise ship Poseidon (hmm, I wonder where they got the title of the movie from).  While the many passengers on the ship are partying the night away to welcome in the New Year, disaster is quickly approaching.  A giant wave, apparently called a rogue wave, strikes the ship, causing it to flip over and many passengers to die in the disastrous process.  With time running out, and the ship slowly becoming a watery grave for all aboard, a small group of passengers struggle to make their way to the bottom of the ship (which is now the top for those not paying attention), and hope to survive.<br /><br />Remaking a movie would seem to be somewhat difficult to me, because you have to try to present a story that has already been done before in a similar manner, while giving the audience something new and engaging to witness.  Some directors have been less original with their remakes, opting to merely copy the source movie scene for scene and word for word, merely updating the surroundings a little bit, of course I don't feel these movies do as well, but that's just me.  Now, I never saw the original "Poseidon Adventure", so I can't say how much of a copy this version is, but even if this remake is merely a scene for scene recreation of the original, I believe it is one of the rare successes that had been achieved this way.<br /><br />The success of "Poseidon" is achieved in part because of the terrific special and practical effects that were employed to make the scenes of the ship being struck by the wave into reality, and for all the disastrous side effects that followed throughout the flipped over ship.  The other part of this movie's success is due to the excellent group of actors that were assembled to fight to survive the sinking cruise ship.  All of the actors did an excellent job with fleshing out these characters over the course of the movie, because there wasn't much time given in the beginning for exposition or development.  I personally felt that the lack of character development prior to the wave striking (which occurs approximately 25 minutes into the movie, providing enough time to basically introduce the characters) was somewhat strange, because you didn't know who to root for, other than by going off whether or not you knew the actor from previous movies and if you liked them or not.  However, once the struggle for survival arc of the movie kicked in, the actors were given more to work with and developed their characters through their interaction with each other allowing them to become more accessible to the audience.<br /><br />The decision to focus the movie on the disaster side of the story early on was an odd choice, but one that worked to the film's advantage, by allowing things to get moving quickly and not allow for a lull in the momentum.  Featuring a rather short running time for a disaster movie, at just 98 minutes, a fact that may seem odd for a Wolfgang Peterson film (his movies generally last 2 hours or more), in this instance the shorter running time made for a much tighter feeling movie which served the story well.  "Poseidon" is a definite must-see among disaster films and one that will keep you on the edge of your seats until the final credits roll.<br /><br />"Poseidon" is rated PG-13 for brief language and peril.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Non-Linear, Dialogue Driven Film That Appeals to Any and All Tastes"></head><body><p>"Reservoir Dogs" is Tarantino at his best.  It's a very focused, character driven film that pretty much anyone can enjoy.  It's one of the better gangster flicks, because unlike recent entries in the genre, it isn't exceedingly bloody or gory.  There is extreme violence, but most of it is suggested or downplayed.  It's also a great drama with an unconventional, non-linear structure that flows so nicely that I couldn't picture it being told any other way.  It's a character driven piece, with most of the action being explained through dialogue after the fact, though I never felt like I was missing anything.<br /><br />The dialogue is very snappy, and that is the shiny exterior that attracted me to the movie.  From the opening speech about Madonna's "Like a Virgin" (which is spot on) to Mr. Orange's reveal to Mr. White, the dialogue carries the film on its back, never letting up.  However, while the dialogue is definitely the main attraction, the quality of pretty much every aspect of the movie is high enough to keep anyone thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />8/10</p></body></html>

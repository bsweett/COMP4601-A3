It opens with a softball game in Saudi Arabia and ends with the assertion that war, hatred, and intolerance are much more complex than most would like to believe. Not only does this seem manipulative, it also seems like a message we've been given before. But when you stop and think about it, there are hardly any original messages left in war movies. They usually achieve one of two things: they either instill compassion by showing a clear divide between allies and enemies, or they prominently feature battle, blood, and death to drive home the point that enemies are more alike than different. I honestly don't know which category "The Kingdom" falls under; there were moments when I thought I knew, but as the scenes progressed, my mind kept changing. By the end, I was more confused than anything else.<br /><br />The opening softball game takes place in a Saudi Arabian military compound, in which American soldiers are stationed along with their families. As the game continues, the compound is attack by Islamic extremists--dozens are gunned down, and dozens more fall victim to suicide bombers. In response, a special FBI task force is sent in with specific instructions to find the mastermind behind the attack and put him to justice. The Special Agents consist of: Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx), Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). Every one of these characters is broadly developed, suggesting a misguided belief in clich&eacute;s. Both Fleury and Mayes are gung ho and mad as hell because one of their colleagues was lost in the attack. Sykes' Southern drawl is second only to his ability to dig through mud. Leavitt is the timid, wisecracking one, serving no real purpose other than to be annoying.<br /><br />They team up with Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), an officer of Saudi Arabia's military. As might be expected, there is some serious culture clash at play, especially since Al Ghazi doesn't speak fluent English. As might also be expected, Fleury and Al Ghazi become friends; I understand that such a thing is possible in real life, but I have a hard time believing that the makers of "The Kingdom" weren't relying on a convenient plot device. In a film like this, nothing much is gained from an international friendship. It exists only for cathartic reasons, giving the audience something to feel good about in the midst of a bad situation. In this case, a war between democracy and fundamentalism is being fought--this is obviously a lot to feel bad about.<br /><br />But the relationship between Fleury and Al Ghazi unfairly plays against the negativity. There's no depth or meaning to their friendship; it's nothing but an excuse to be poignant and sentimental. To elaborate on this would give too much away, so let's just say that the ending reiterates the message that tolerance is a distant goal. This message has been firmly established in the minds of the movie going public, so firmly, in fact, that it's practically become a convention of war movies. And when such a message is paired with needlessly sappy imagery, I can't help but feel conned. Example: Mayes, a lollipop junky, offers one of her lollipops to a Saudi Arabian girl no more than seven years old. Something so melodramatic doesn't belong in a film like this.<br /><br />Still, it would be too harsh to say that this film is a complete failure. Indeed, it has moments of effectiveness, such as inter cut shots of terrorists constructing homemade bombs. To watch this footage is to be reminded that such people actually exist, which helps to firmly ground the audience in reality. One can't help but wonder the thoughts going through their heads: Despite what they're brainwashed to believe, are they really ready to take their own lives? After all, they're human beings above all else--the terrorist ideology comes later.<br /><br />If only "The Kingdom" could fully support such thought provoking material. This film tries so hard to be humanistic that it only becomes fatalistic, and this is bad because I knew that its heart was in the right place. Peter Berg shows promise as a filmmaker, especially since his projects are very character-oriented ("Friday Night Lights," for example). But something was missing from "The Kingdom," something that prevented it from being a compelling drama. Even Jeremy Piven as an American ambassador to Saudi Arabia doesn't help things much, especially since his character is so briefly featured. I think what's missing is the willingness to be daring; a shootout occurs near the end of the film, and despite being violent, graphic, and difficult to watch, it felt restrained and incomplete. If a movie like this wants to send a clear, important message to its audience, then I'm afraid restraint is not going to work.</p></body></html>

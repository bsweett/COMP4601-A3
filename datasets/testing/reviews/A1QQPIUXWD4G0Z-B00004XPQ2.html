The film still stands as one of the greatest war films ever made with superb direction and an all-star cast that provide deep character studies with all the action and tension one expects from a war story.<br /><br />Confined to an inhospitable Japanese prison camp burried in the jungles of Southeast Asia, a British POW, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), is subjected to the cruel torture of the camp commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) for choosing to stand for principle as to the treatment of his officers.  Saito needs competent engineers and laborers to build a railroad tressle bridge on a tight schedule and, although at first infuriated by Nicholson's stiff upper lip and low opinion of Japanese culture, he begins to exploit Nicholson's ego to compel him to build the bridge properly and on time.  Thinking that he will show the 'inferior' Japanese how much better the English are in engineering, Nicholson becomes obsessed with building the enemy bridge and oblivious to the treasonous implications of such an act.  In the mean time, a cowardly American POW (William Holden) escapes to safety only to be later coerced by the English to return and sabotage the bridge in a commando raid.  Leading the British demolition expert (Jack Hawkins), Holden's character returns to the bridge for the final showdown.<br /><br />This is a brilliant war film with a plot that's primarily character driven as opposed to action driven: the tension comes from the clash of wills between all of the characters as opposed to a non-stop action clash of arms.  The film also seems to deal with the uncertain consequences of bravery and cowardice in the sense that, although Nicholson at first bravely stands for his principles, he blindly becomes a suppliant to Colonel Saito's plans to finish the bridge.  On the other hand, although Holden's character is the epidemy of cowardice and self-interest, it is he who becomes one of the true heroes of the story.  The film in essence follows the story by Pierre Boulle but, as is almost always the case, the book is better.  In the book, there is no flinching to Nicholson's unrelenting snobbishness and utter stupidity and he does not 'wake up' at the last minute to fall on the detonator: the mission fails. Also, William Holden's character does not exist. There is no American ex-POW guiding the commandos back to the bridge.<br /><br />This film is very well directed and has great camera work.  Filmed in Sri Lanka, the great cinematography captures every ray of heat and drop of humidity one finds in the dense jungle. The acting is top knotch all the way around. Finally, who can forget the timeless whistling tune sung by the POWs.  This is another great drama that should be in every war film lover's collection.</p></body></html>

Well that's interesting to see him break away from the everyday action hero sanerio he's usally in.  Jamie Foxx not in a comedy?  Oh boy, now this is a risk.  Either it's good ot it's awful.<br /><br />Max(Jamie Foxx) is your everyday cab driver, a honest one for the past 12 years of his services to people.  After his cab drive with Annie(Jada Pickett Smith)  Then comes a guy who's hair is the same color as his suit, Vincint(Tom Cruise).  He gives off some nice loot for a couple of stops that usally cost a lot less, but when a huge puzzle peice as to who Vincint really is lands right in front of Max's face, it's all a rollarcoaster of thrills as to what happens next.<br /><br />This movie does a real good job of keeping the susspence in the movie until the end.  And the fact that Jamie and Tom have proved loyal to their roles dispite typical good guy, and comedy senerios in the past.  Also during the action seenes, they are well directed, and the live style sound effects of the fighting and the gunfights really gets your adreniline rushing during the sceenes.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the end.  A whole bunch a bullets, a whole bunch of misses, only 3 feet apart(Even if it was dark, you could get the jist of where the person was.)<br /><br />Collateral definitly was a huge breakthrough for Jamie Foxx's carrer which got him a oscar nomination.  And after that he got a well deserved best actor award for his extrodinary performance as Ray Charles.  As for Tom, hey, he can finally be the bad guy once in a while which is good to know.  This movie has great suspenction in it, and it also has great action sceenes in it.  Just what to expect from the Director of Heat(Michael Mann).  If you love suspence movies or movies that kick up a good heartracer once in a while, you should definitly check this out. If you have nothing but negative opinions of Ton and Jamie, This might change your mind about these 2 actors who, to me, did good in a excellent movie., or you might be saying what is Michael Mann's pproblem choosing these 2 guys to play lead roles in a movie.  But it should be checked out.<br /><br />Peace</p></body></html>

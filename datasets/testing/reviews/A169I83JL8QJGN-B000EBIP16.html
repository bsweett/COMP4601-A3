That is not the case as long as you know what to expect. One expectation that was set by the pre-release review I read was that the special effects would not be spectacular. They're not. In fact, the CGI is so far from realistic it may have been better to do this as a computer animated feature. Nevertheless, don't let the mediocre CGI steer you away from this otherwise phenomenal film.<br /> I always had a hard time watching the original BBC versions as the special effects and puppets were absolutely abysmal, but it was still incredibly true to the book. My biggest fear with this one was that would resolve the special effects issues, but would stray from the novel so much that it would become unwatchable. My biggest fear was that they would modify the content to loose it's religious allegory in order to "avoid offending people". Thankfully the director was ever true to the novel, committing a few minor sins of omission, but leaving the main story, and it's metaphors in tact, and for that I am grateful. The story follows CS Lewis's novel nearly perfectly, loosing only minor details, and minor bits of dialogue, and not adding anything that would disrupt the flow of the original tale.<br /> I'm really proud of Disney for having the guts to do this film right, and having the guts to keep CS Lewis's original vision intact. Thank you.<br /> Although the CGI effects were disappointing after some of the newer fantasy films such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, CS Lewis's classic has finally been given the definitive visual version of the tale that it has long deserved... and I can finally retire the abysmal BBC version.<br /> The acting in here is fantastic, the cinematography is artistically brilliant, and best of all Aslan is awesome. If you can only see one movie this winter, see this one. You aren't likely to regret it, as long as you don't have too high of expectations for the CGI.</p></body></html>

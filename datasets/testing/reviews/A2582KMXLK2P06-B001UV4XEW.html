You have to be a bit patient and wait for them, because let's be honest, the first 20 minutes of film are certainly nothing to brag about.  The juvenile humor that takes place in the very beginning of the movie is *extremely* misleading.<br /><br />The main reason the Hangover is so good to me has MORE to do with the storyline than the style of humor.  Seriously!<br /><br />The storyline is good- four... er, make that *three* young guys wake up one morning with a MAJOR hangover, and they have absolutely no idea what happened the night before.  All they have to go on as far as remembering what happened the night before are the things right in front of them, at the hotel room, such as a baby in the closet, a tiger in the bathroom, one of the guys having a missing tooth, and other things.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, these three guys go on an adventure of a lifetime as they retrace their steps through Las Vegas.<br /><br />There's also a very dirty and disgusting kind of humor that manages to weave itself through the storyline, so I can only recommend this movie to people who are 16 years old or older.</p></body></html>

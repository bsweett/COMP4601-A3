<meta name="summary" content="The Sour Taste Of Revenge..."></head><body><p>Certain parallels between Charles Bronson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a> and THE BRAVE ONE have undoubtedly already been drawn, and rightfully so. Both focus on vigilante justice by a man (or woman) who was wronged by thugs. But herein lay the ONLY similarity, making The Brave One a somewhat unique animal.<br /><br />What drove Bronson's Paul Kersey character was anger, whereas Jodi Foster's Erica Bain is driven by fear after a brutal attack in a New York park that leaves her fianc&eacute; David (Naveen Andrews, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017HZZP0">Lost TV Series</a>) dead and herself in a coma for weeks.<br /><br />Erica, a well-known radio personality, has to try and get her life back on track, but fear of everything infringes upon her every wish. Walking down hallways make her dizzy, and going out at night is out of the question. Upon returning to work she finds she can hardly breath and confides much to her boss Carol (Mary Steenburgen, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTFFO0">The Dead Girl</a>). Coming to terms with her fear, Erica purchases an illegal handgun and, after finding herself near another person who's violence dismayed her, kills someone with her new gun. Her hand is steady. She doesn't shake. Her life of fear is changing into...something else.<br /><br />A path of vigilante deaths get the cops involved and Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUWU">Hustle & Flow</a>) is on the case. He's also involved in trying to solve the murder of Erica's fianc&eacute; and the two form an unusual relationship based on suspicion and the dichotomy of right versus legalities. Their interplay is unique and tenuous as the two learn more about each other and come to a mutual form of respect ...and perhaps much more.<br /><br />Those similarities I mentioned at the beginning are now sorely lost. Mainly because Bronson's Paul Kersey (a man and the stereotype for vigilantism) and Foster's Erica Bain (a woman and not a stereotype) are in different ballparks. Kersey did it for revenge from the get-go, while Bain's in initially about how to deal with her fear, but later becomes a convoluted form of animalistic revenge. The damage she's doing to herself are felt within the character and not from without. Her realization that she "doesn't tremble" when she kills someone is both unsettling and comforting. That she gets better and better at killing is equally so.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the film, however, is that it initially sets Terrence Howard's Detective Mercer up as a very good and forthright cop, but in the end he is anything but that. He crosses the line between right and legally right with exceptional ease, which kind of ruined the ending for me; too simplistic for such a complex man.<br /><br />But nothing can be taken away from Jodi Foster (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFLKF8">Inside Man</a>). Still plugging along after all these years, she's still able to carry a film's weight with grace, honor and sheer terror.<br /><br />A worthy evening diversion for those interested in the genre.</p></body></html>

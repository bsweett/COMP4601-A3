No doubt many African nations have been torn asunder by civil war.  No doubt there have been horrendous atrocities.  And no doubt preteen boys have been literally snatched from the arms of their parents and turned into ruthless killers.  But when a movie, BLOOD DIAMOND, depicts all of the above in such a brutal, graphic nature, the question is begged:  Is it really that bad over there. . .or, perhaps, has there been a little embellishment?<br /><br />But I digress.  Whether the quest for a 'Mother Lode' diamond in war-torn Sierra Leone is slightly exaggerated in terms of its gratuitous, mind-numbing violence, the fact remains this movie is pause-everything-else-in-your-life riveting.  When a filmmaker has completely and unequivocally drawn in his viewer--makes the viewer forget about everything else other than what he/she is watching on the screen--then cinema magic has been captured in a can.  So kudos to the always-innovative Edward Zwick:  His astonishing, gasping scenes had me flinching and weaving and jumping so much the springs in my recliner are creaking.  By the time the credits were rolling I felt mentally and physically drained--and grandly entertained.<br /><br />As the lead (a former mercenary turned diamond smuggler with a heart of gold), Leonardo DiCaprio continues to surprise.  For the longest time he was an annoying scarecrow; now he's morphing into an accomplished thespian right before our eyes.  I really enjoyed his Rhodesian accent (or whatever they're calling Rhodesia these days).  And has Djimon Hounsou ever been lousy in a movie?  Absolutely not, and his portrayal of a fisherman trying to find and salvage his family is certainly no exception.  Jennifer Connelly looks good--even after a couple of nights in the jungle.  The on-screen tension between herself and Leo is fun to watch.  In fact, BLOOD DIAMOND, even if all the chaos and blood lust is a tad over the top, is fun to watch.  And if not fun, riveting works just fine.  Five 14-karat gold stars.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

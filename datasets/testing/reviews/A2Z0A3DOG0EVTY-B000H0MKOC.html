Because it seems like every time I go to the movies I remember back to one of the classics in literature that I callously never read.  It was Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal I thought back on after finishing THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, because I now realize that modern satire is joke.<br /><br />Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhardt, In The Company of Men)  is as smooth as the cigarettes he's promoting.  As the main lobbyist for big tobacco, it's his job to look America in the eye and say "Want to smoke."  The film follows him as he convinces group after group that Big Tobacco is the victim and that those who are fighting against him are the villains.  There are bumps along the way, including a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy), a nosy journalist (Katie Holmes), and a few attempts on his life.  But with some good old American B.S. he may just make it.<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is an almost biting satire, it presents all the characters a great satire needs, and it's full of button pushing ideas that should drag the audience right along with it.  But squanders them by playing too safe, by not taking sides, and by coping out at the last moment.  Great satire should end with half the characters dead lying in a physical, psychological, or farcical bloodbath. Like in Swift's A Modest Proposal, where he mentions that his countrymen would do well to resort to cannibalism.  The hero of the story should be standing next to God, or burning in hell for his misdeeds.  THANK YOU FOR SMOKING just winks at you, provides a couple of laughs, and that's all.<br /><br />The major problem is that the screenplay, by Jason Reitman (who also directs), falls in love with the main character to a degree that allows him the opportunity to get away with everything.  That's would be fine, but the villains in the film are not drawn as well and so his victory's seem paltry.  His Villains are so stereotypical and the actors bring nothing to them that is very profound.  Satire without some blood and guts on the floor is pointless.<br /><br />As for the performances they just sit there.  No one is big enough.  That actors wander in and out of each scene, and the only one we really get to know is Nick.  But Nick is not that vulnerable, even when the script tries to paint him that way.  Aaron Eckhardt is too confident. I didn't believe his small moment of insecurity once.  Because the script doesn't let him fail for long.<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is not a bad movie.  It's pretty funny and  It's quite timely.  But as a satire it's not focused enough, and it doesn't pull enough punches.  I'm glad I saw it, but I don't recommend it.</p></body></html>

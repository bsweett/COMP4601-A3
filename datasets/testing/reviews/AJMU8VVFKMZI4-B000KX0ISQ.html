Broderick gives a great performance as well as the ever talented Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Andre Braugher.  I, too, love the 54th and the memory of what these men accomplished should never be forgotten.  Great direction, script and score.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

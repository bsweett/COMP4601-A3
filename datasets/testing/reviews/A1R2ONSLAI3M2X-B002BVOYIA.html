Don Cheadle who plays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina delivers an outstanding and heartwarming performance. This is truly a inspirational film. Based on the true story of a very courageous man, this film recounts the terror that Paul Rusesabagina, his family and the country of Rwanda experienced when war broke out in their small country and many of Tutsis were slaughtered. Unable to just watch all the madness, Paul opens his hotel to over 1,000 refugees. We see a dedicated man go to great lengths to save his people and try to put an end to the violence. There are many touching and heartbreaking scenes in this movie but knowing that this is a true story, it makes this film even more riveting. Paul is a great man of courage and many lives were saved due to his efforts. There are great special features on this DVD giving us even more insight to the actual terror that happen in Rwanda. Although we find out the film was actually shot in South Africa, this doesn't take away from the movie. A must have movie that really opens your eyes to the violence in this world.</p></body></html>

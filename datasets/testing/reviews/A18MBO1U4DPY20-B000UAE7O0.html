It is sick to look at, has characaters with a very loud presence and it doesn't really evoke a human touch like Death Proof did. I thought it was terrible to honest especially cause I loved Death Proof. Now, you're laughing thinking I'm the only person who probably liked Death Proof more. Planet Terror is like a flaky irritating push on all action films that have been made. It tries to be clever but then even Scary Movie tried.<br /><br />Overall, a 5/10<br />Bruce Willis has no role, Naveen Andrews is after testicles in the film (!) and the storyline is just a sham. The sort of film I don't want to be reminded of. Even the average 28 Weeks Later was better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just gets better"></head><body><p>This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen: not only does it avoid degenerating into a formula - with one of the principal characters killed off at the beginning - but it adds to the depth of all the players' characters. Bourne is still evolving in Damon's hands, becoming a new person from the confused automaton that he was in the first film, someone you can believe in and allow to enter your imagination. Of course, there are phenomenal action scenes, filmed in a you-are-there jerkiness, that reach new heights of realism in action film. (Interestingly, the director refused to use any computer animation, as he rightly knew the audience would recognise it as such.)<br /><br />But it is Damon who truly impresses: he adds creative twists to his characters like only a truly great actor can, carrying an entire environment with him you can identify with and believe, a genuine consciousness that the viewer can envision and empathise with. I would say he is this generation's Gene Hackman, a star who rises not on simple sex appeal but on outstanding acting talent. I would watch any film he is in.<br /><br />Warmly recommended. Let's hope they stop here, while the quality is maintained.</p></body></html>

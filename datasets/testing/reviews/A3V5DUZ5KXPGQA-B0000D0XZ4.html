<meta name="summary" content="Could've been better but not bad"></head><body><p>While I do think Ang Lee's &quot;HULK&quot; does fall short in a lot of areas, I don't think it deserves most of the criticism it gets.<p>THE CG HULK<br />  Despite their best efforts, this Hulk looks computer generated and fake. Still, it does work when you see the creature close up. Also, people complained that they wanted a real actor to do the Hulk but I take a bit of an exception to that. If you are going to have the comic book Hulk, then NO ACTOR could do that! Not even Lou Ferrigno in his prime could've done the things that the comic book Hulk does and make it look believable! I will give Ang points for having the guts to go the CG route.<p>THE CAST<br />  Eric Bana is an okay Bruce Banner (though the best will always be the late Bill Bixby on the TV series). Jennifer Connelly is great as Betty Ross while Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte are awesome as General Ross and David Banner respectively! <p>THE STORY<br />  Okay but average. Could've been shorten in some spots but go longer in others. Best scene is near the end when David and Bruce square off at the army base. <p>OVERALL VIEW<br />  I think this film could've been better but it gets slammed more than it deserves. It wasn't THAT bad. Also, its a victim of the Spider-Man craze! While I loved Spider-Man, many people have this stigma that every Marvel based film should be like Spider-Man (though the X-Men films doesn't seem to suffer from this stigma). I think that's so bull! Hulk ISN'T MEANT TO BE SPIDER-MAN! They are two totally different characters in totally different worlds and any comparison as far as characters and their worlds is ridiculous! As far as story development and pacing, Spider-Man is a far better story without a doubt but Hulk is meant to be a psychological story so it is going to be slow in some spots (I just feel that they dragged too long in some spots, even for a psychological story). It isn't just about a man who changes into a monster. Its about a man dealing with his inner rage and psychological trama and his search for peace. This theme is in all the versions of the Hulk, including the TV series.<br />  Anyway, see the film and decide for yourself.</p></body></html>

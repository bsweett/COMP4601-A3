It is easy to equate this brilliant Medieval tomfoolery with something that preceded it but this film is a true original.  The film is an intricately plotted series of comic setpieces that mocks the Arthurian legend with equal amounts of silliness and informed intelligence.  Thirty years on this film has lost none of it's comic luster.  I have numerous favorite moments but that would ruin it for the uninitiated.  I was fortunate to have seen this film when I was a teenager theatrically back in the day when the Pythons brand of madness was just breaking on these shores.  This package includes alot of good extras including commentaries by the surviving Pythons(R.I.P. Graham Chapman) and the "Lego" version of the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the best rock movie yet"></head><body><p>rock has to go to the rain forest to bring a guy home for a criminal who he is forced to work for.there is the rock,some goofy idiot hes chasing whose also in bulletproof monk.the bad guy plays a mob type in every movie ive ever seen him in.but well.the kids will like it too.it is a action movie.there are some minor flaws with this like the rock delivering a rock bottom during a fight.CHEESEY!!!!!!!!!!the part where the monkey humps rocks face is just nasty.i dont see why the directors have a great movie like this one then go throw a monkey trying to force himself on an x-wrestler into it.its just stupid.theres this one mexican chick in it but shes to cranky to be hot.there is an outstanding fight scene pitting the rock against some midget rain fotest people.this movie is better than the hype!</p></body></html>

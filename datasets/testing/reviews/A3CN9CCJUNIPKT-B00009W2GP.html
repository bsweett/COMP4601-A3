I wasn't wild about the first "Matrix" film, but was pretty much on board after seeing #2, considering it a fine, fast-paced, pleasantly pseudo-profound, comicbooky action film. And while this installment started off with a promising action-packed nonchalance, it quickly devolved into a loud, flimsy, poorly plotted morass. Of course, no one needs little old me to tell them about this flick's shortcomings: fans of the series deserted New Zion in droves after this turkey was released... But I still had to check it out and see for myself.  Oh, well.  By the way, Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinty, Canoe's love interest, is one of the least interesting screen actors I have ever seen.  Big flaw in the casting there, which helps drag the series down on a number of occasions.</p></body></html>

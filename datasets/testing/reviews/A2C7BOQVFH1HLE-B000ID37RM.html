<meta name="summary" content="Tender, Touching Tale about Innocence Lost!"></head><body><p>Having read the book twice and now watching the film, it's nice to see that the film has actually done justice to the book in that it's successful in bringing out the actual message of innocence lost and about the difference between right and wrong, good and evil as seen from the point of view of 3 children and specifically the little girl Scout.  People tend to hate and seek to destroy that which they don't understand just because it scares them and the children learn at the end that the best way to overcome this fear is to face it head on and to seek to learn and understand rather than to judge and destroy.  At the end, this is what Scout does as she befriends the feared Boo who saves her brother's life.  We all naturally love to support the underdog and this film tells the story of Atticus fighting for justice and teaching his kids as he does so by his actions as well as his words.<br /><br />This dvd has an excellent documentary about the film as well as good interviews with the cast and crew as they look back at their experiences while making the film.  The picture quality is okay but not perfect and could do with another restoration job although the 2-channel mono sound quality is okay but a 5.1 surround option would have been much appreciated.  Overall, this is a well-crafted film with excellent acting and an excellent screenplay.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

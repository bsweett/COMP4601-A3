<meta name="summary" content="Wayne's Focus, Tenacity, Grit and Vehemence makes this a must see movie."></head><body><p>I think the Searchers is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Mainly because, faced with seeming insurmontable obstacles, Wayne keeps searching for his niece for years.  It is amazing how the years pass in the film, and you realize, what it must have taken for the character to keep trying, driving himself day after day.<br /><br />There are some cute moments in the movie, but John Wayne's passion to find his niece is just a classic piece of film making.<br /><br />I remember watching a special about the movie and was intrigued at how much work went into filming on location in Arizona.  Ford really was a motivator and a genius when it came to film, and this was one of his favorites from what I remember.<br /><br />If you like John Wayne movies, you just love this.  Natalie Wood does a great job as his niece grown up.<br /><br />I think it is a great lesson of life, however, the interest here is that in a time when murder and mayhem reigned in the Southwest, the passion of the time saw extremes in hatred on both sides of the racial divide.<br /><br />Finally, it is really just a great story and very well done movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Alexander' gets a do-over"></head><body><p>"Newly inspired, faster paced, more action packed!" shouts the DVD cover of Oliver Stone's "Alexander: Director's Cut." That new inspiration came the hard way: from the lashing "Alexander" took from legions of critics and from the $150 million film's humiliation at U.S. boxoffices.<br /><br />Director Stone took the opportunity to re-edit key scenes, lengthening here and shortening there. A pair of flashbacks from Alexander the Great's youth now appear later in the film, shaking up the third act and making the epic less linear. But not  necessarily better.<br /><br />A "beautiful and so tender scene" between the king and his male lover hits the floor as Stone tones down the bisexual content. "I can't tell you how many 'real guys' are turned off to this s--t," Stone explains.<br /><br />"Alexander II" loses only eight minutes from the original three-hour running time, though, and the elements that inspired all that hooting and cackling remain: Colin Farrell's goofy blond locks, Alexander's Irish brogue, the odd casting of Angelina Jolie as his mother, Jolie's Natasha-the-cartoon-spy accent, and so on.<br /><br />Those drawn to the DVD by the promise of an improved and intensified film won't have an experience differing all that much from the one in theaters. Expecting little -- and equipped with pause buttons -- many first-time viewers will wonder what the fuss was over this offbeat and mostly entertaining biopic -- probably best approached as an overgrown sword-and-sandal movie, a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Warner released "Alexander" in two double-disc sets: Stone's new cut and the original theatrical. The two versions are not available in one package, unfortunately, and fans springing for both sets will be disappointed to find nearly identical extras. Images are widescreen (about 2.40:1) with brilliant colors and steely sharpness when it is called for. The 5.1 audio deploys the battle scenes with efficiency (sorry, no DTS).<br /><br />Stone works solo on the director's cut commentary. He points out the new changes and offers brief explanations for making them. The goal, basically, was "to keep it moving." Much of Stone's talk is repeated on the theatrical DVD's commentary, which edits in observations from historical adviser Robin Lane Fox. Stone does a good job, but the commentary with Fox is stronger and you learn a lot about the real Alexander.<br /><br />Disc 2 features an hour-and-a-half documentary directed in ragged but effective style by Stone's son Sean. His total access resulted in an unusually candid portrait of a production working through a swarm of problems in lands such as Morocco, Thailand and India. Vangelis pretends to be scoring the film in a brief extra. The movie's frenzied teaser and trailer are included, both faster paced and action packed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could have been better."></head><body><p>This is a good movie the first time you see it, but after that there is no reason to watch it again.  Sean penn's performance although deserving of a nomination could have been better, i think johnny depp should have got it.  He shows emotion throughout, but in some scenes he lacks the right expressions to pull off the effect, the drama suffers becuase when he should be freaking out like in the scene when the cops are holding back(the best scene in the movie), he doesnt.  Tim robbins is good but also could have done better.  The story is average at best.  The ending is the biggest dissapointment and is very predictable, they should change it really.  The movie is an 8 out of a 10 the first time then goes down to a 3 the next.</p></body></html>

I believe he came across better because you could see his facial expressions in this one. Green Goblin's face was hidden during his evil moments. I like this one better because there is more at risk in this one. For Spidey fans that don't know; Jameson's son becomes a Man Wolf in the comics...and professor Connors becomes the Lizard.  Now if only the Lizard is in number 3; it might be just as good.  I have to reccomend this one. It has a lot more Spidey action that wasn't in the first. If you like the comic; this movie duplicates the best of the series on the silver screen!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the nightmare before wedding day"></head><body><p>tim burton teams up with muse johnny depp and wife helena bonham-carter for what we can only hope is a warmup for the forthcoming "sweeney todd".  depp overdoes his fey effete quality a bit too much, and i am not a fan of this particular animation look, but it is good if you are a devotee.  strong supporting voice work from the likes of albert finney, christopher lee, and tracey ullman add to the fun.  i wish i could give this a 4th star, but it just falls a trifle short for me.</p></body></html>

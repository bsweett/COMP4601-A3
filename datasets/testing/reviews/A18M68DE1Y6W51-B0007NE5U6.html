<meta name="summary" content="Pure Enjoyment"></head><body><p>I had read, and laughed hilariously through, Helen Fieldings' book of the same name, so I was on tenterhooks to see the movie. I would not say it's as good as the book or even the first movie, but it has plenty to recommend it, and I found myself hooting with laughter more than once.<br /><br />Just remember where the last movie left off, and settle back for the mindless but purely enjoyable sequel. Bridget is still getting into impossible situations at work, all is NOT well with Darcy, and the nefarious Daniel (Hugh Grant at his most wicked and desirable) turns up again to muddy the waters. Throw in a Thai prison, a drug smuggling charge and sundry other embarrassing predicaments, and you've got the gist.<br /><br />Hugh Grant and Colin Firth have a truly side-splitting fight (again, but better than the first movie), each is perfect in his role, as always. Renee Zellweger, puffed up to the max, is wonderful as the overweight Bridget, although I must say that a scene BEFORE the ending, which must have been shot last, has Renee considerably slimmed down, only to appear heavier than ever in the very next scene. Quite disconcerting, actually.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are a riot, especially when Hugh and Colin, separately, each diss the other (in fun) and discuss the fun they had filming the memorable fight scene.<br /><br />Altogether a fun addition to one's collection, maybe not as perfect as the first, but so what? I loved it anyway.</p></body></html>

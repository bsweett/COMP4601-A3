For 2010 that movie that defied all my pre-conceived notions was director Darren Aronofsky's glimpse into insanity known simply as Black Swan.<br /><br />If you hadn't already learned, 2010's highly acclaimed drama Black Swan is about ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman).  After four years in a prestigious New York City ballet studio (I don't remember the title of the company ever being given within the film) Nina tries desperately for the part of the Swan Queen in the year's production of Swan Lake.  The company leader, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), is a strong willed man who lets no boundaries come between him and his vision, willing to make aggressive, sexual advances solely to make a point on how he wants a performance to be done.  When Nina auditions she perfects the routine for the White Swan, but is told by Leroy that she simply is too uptight and controlled to play the White Swan's evil doppelganger, the Black Swan.  After biting the Leroy's lip when he attempts to sexually assault her Nina is given the role of the Swan Queen with Leroy claiming that the biting incident was the spark he needed to show she was capable of the role.<br /><br />Nina is a goody-two-shoes having the color pink enshrouding her entire room and living under the care of her overbearing mother (note that Nina is clearly out of her teens) who wishes for the best but also causes Nina to be incapable of truly living outside of the ballet.  Her mother wishes the best for her daughter, but it is clear she's been too controlling of her daughter's life, which in part is the cause of the Nina's tragic downward spiral.  At first glance she is a caring mother, but as the plot progresses it is clear her control reaches far too deep into Nina's life<br /><br />Nina at the same time meets with a new dancer, Lilly (Mila Kunis), who unlike Nina isn't a perfectionist, but comes across as very natural.  Lilly is also an outgoing girl, smoking in the studio, taking drugs, and filling her evenings with wild sexual exploits.  Eventually, Nina is brought in by Lilly's advances and begins a descent into darkness.  But as the plot progresses further towards its destructive climax Nina begins to believe that Lilly is not out to befriend her, but instead attempting to steal from her the role of Swan Queen which she had worked so very hard to achieve.  The film ends with the opening night of Swan Lake where everything ties together in a special effects fueled finale.<br /><br />The trailers in no way prepared me for the nightmare that is Black Swan.  Black Swan is perhaps the best psychological horror film of the last five years, if not the decade!  I knew nothing about ballet (except a few holiday visits to the Nutcracker), but this movie made sure it was all easy to follow for those uninitiated in the art.  Easily understood is the common notion of an individual seeking perfection, and that is Nina's flaw.  Perfection is what she seeks and with her good nature taking the role of the Black Swan begins to drive her mad and Natalie Portman plays the part pitch-perfect!<br /><br />I knew the buzz, knew that Aronofsky is one of the great directors currently working, yet up until I arrived at the theater I doubted that a movie centered on ballet would entertain me as a male member of the audience.  By the end of the movie I realize this could have been about anything, but the ballet allows for majestic, dark imagery mixed with classical music (alongside another great score from Clint Mansell who also did the infamous score for Requiem for a Dream with Aronofsky).  This is the first movie in years, and I do mean years, that has made me cringe in my seat.  The violence is minimum, but what it has I found far more frightening than any today's "torture porn" films (see: Saw franchise).  Aronofsky knows how to make the most out of the violence in his film and each time it left an impact on me as a viewer.<br /><br />There will always be that stuck-up portion of the population (particularly guys) who will avoid this movie being "Yo, this ballet stuff is so gay!" and trust me, I going into the theater alone, as a young man to see a movie about a ballet dancer, I was rather uncomfortable...But once the movie started all those thoughts were left behind!  I couldn't believe it!  Aronofsky made a great movie mixing ballet with psychological horror!  There is nothing stupid or girly about this movie.  In fact, this is far more disturbing material than three fourths of the films released in the few years.<br /><br />You'll have to be into movies that tell movies through surreal imagery to really enjoy Black Swan, because the one flaw is that some of the events make no sense if you try to put it under the scrutiny of logic.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great movie, but one thing in its climax takes a great deal of suspension of disbelief (if you're like me you were too blown away by how awesome the climax is to notice this leap of logic until after you've left the theater).<br /><br />If you're into surreal movies, or psychological horror films dealing with an individuals descent into insanity than I couldn't recommend this movie enough.  If you're some "macho, macho man" or think all films have to make perfect sense than you might want to skip it.<br /><br />I personally say Black Swan easily in the top five films of 2010!</p></body></html>

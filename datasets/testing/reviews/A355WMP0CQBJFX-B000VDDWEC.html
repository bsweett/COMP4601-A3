<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE GREAT ZOMBIE MOVIES!!"></head><body><p>a city ravished by disease, millions of zombies, only a few survivors, and you turn with just one drop of blood...crazy. loved this movie, i thought it was very well done. all the chaos, a world of the dead, where's safety, how do you get out? one fine day this man awakens to find the city totally alone. no one, no where, what's going on. everything is turned upside down. he realizes he's not alone. there are thousands of people, and they are very fast. only one problem, they're all dead. running around with a virus, that if a tiny drop falls on you, you become one of them. he has to run, he has to hide, but where? he finds other survivors who together they try to find some help, a way out. when finally they think they have, they still have to fight to survive. i love zombies, i think they're the freakiest. they're people and they're dead, and all they want is to eat people. pretty damn scary. the whole movie was very good, i really liked it. i didn't get scared, but the film in general was wicked good. two thumbs up no doubt.</p></body></html>

The movie had a familiar feel to it, not of the obvious though, Predator movies, and Aliens. It rather felt, sometimes glaringly, similiar to Mortal Kombat. The special effects reminded me of Resident Evil, along with some of the noise and cinematography (slow motion). But then, it felt slashed, and edited by a cruel hand. I imagine w.s. anderson very upset by the tone of the movie. I really was surprised at how short it felt. It gives you a little action (what everyone was holding their breathe for from AVP!) then they take away quickly, and drive you away towards a climax nearly at a pitch of 90 degrees! NO time to savor the mortal kombat of sci fi's most familiar icons. I felt the movie included way too much build up, the setting was brooded over and it was obvious. On a personal note, If i may: Why change the familiar noise of the predator? Those things I pick up quickly, for instance, an unfamiliar, and very annoying, lion roar sound. Then anderson gives a little back, the familiar clicking or purring of the predator. All of the familiarities, of mine, have been downplayed. The movie was geared towards too large an audience. But, the movie has done wonderful in sales, and so, another chance will more than likely be given to this promising franchise. Go ahead and rent this. It's worth a fun evening.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unique and different."></head><body><p>This movie was recommended to me by my Amazon friend Ron.<br />Ron seems to know my taste in movies and TV pretty well by now as "The Orphanage" was right up my alley.<br />Definitely a horror movie but if you're expecting "Saw" or "Hostel" stop reading now.<br />I'm a fan of slow burn horror that actually requires you to think.<br />Gore doesn't frighten me.<br />Mind trips are much more effective and difficult to come by nowadays.<br /><br />The good?<br />Excellent acting, direction, score, pacing....pretty much everything was done perfectly.<br />I LOVED the ending, so........never mind I don't want to spoil it.<br /><br />The bad?<br />Nothing really.<br />I heard they're doing an American remake....oh joy (deliberate sarcasm).<br />The movie is in Spanish so subtitles are something you can tolerate or not.<br />Other than that.......nothing.<br /><br />An incredible movie that deserves to be seen by the (me included) jaded American horror audience.<br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

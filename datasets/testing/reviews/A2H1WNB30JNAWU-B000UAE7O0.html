<meta name="summary" content="Good horror movie with humor thrown in as needed"></head><body><p>Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez makes a good horror movie with tons of humor one liners thrown in when need be.  I thought the actors did a good job on the movie and well acted with what they had to work with characters wise and development.  Part of me has always been into zombie movies and this just added to my collection of good horror movie with some zombie elements.  So if you like zombie movies and or just a good horror edge of seat entertainment then pick this movie up and enjoy some good gross out horror scenes couple of scenes people are being ate fresh first.  So if your not gross out by that type of horror scenes then pick this movie up and watch it with some friends or buddies.</p></body></html>

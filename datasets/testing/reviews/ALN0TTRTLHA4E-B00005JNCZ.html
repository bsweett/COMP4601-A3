Gueverra at the time did not have much money and he and his travelling companion set of on a battered old motor cycle. Che was a final year medical student in Argentina the wealthiest of the South American countries. He and his companion soon ran out of money and had to scam their way around trying to get free food and accommodation. Some of the scams were elaborate and involved passing themselves off as qualified and famous medical practitioners.<br /><br />Che is of course famous as he became one of the lieutenants of Fidel Castro the insurgent who overthrew the Basta regime and set up the first and only communist state in America. The diaries that Che kept of his 1952 journey are of some significance in charting the change in his life from being a middle class aspiring doctor to becoming a social revolutionary. His biographers suggest that it was on this trip that he became aware of the degree of poverty in South America and also the fact that the existing power structures were somewhat corrupt.<br /><br />As a film the main strength is the rendition of the landscape. If one reads the biography of Che one finds that he engaged widely in all sorts of petty dishonesty during the trip. The film tries to paint a more sanitised portrait showing him to be reluctant to slip into dishonesty and his reluctance slowed down his more amoral friend. There is a tendency of the film to suggest a slight saintliness and that he was a sort of St Francis type character with a regard for the poor.<br /><br />This of course is somewhat at variance with how those who have become prominent communists act in practice. Most successful communists tend to be somewhat insensitive and ruthless in their interpersonal dealings.  Che was a successful and tough military leader(at least before Bolivia) rather than being a Argentinian version of Ghandi.<br /><br />Despite all that the film is rather pleasant. The photography is terrific and there is enough narrative interest and plot to prevent you getting to bored.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A terrifically acted, tense, drug fuelled melodrama."></head><body><p>There are some terrific, tense scenes in Maria Full Of Grace, a heavily dramatic and horrifyingly real drug mule movie. This is a tormenting portrait of a resourceful young woman who refuses to play the hand that life has dealt her, which is to remain poor, and exploited in rural Columbia. The fierce and startlingly vital Maria Alvarez (the beautiful Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a seventeen-year-old Colombian teen. She's restless, rebellious, and feisty. She also has a loving mother, but she's tired of working at shearing roe stems at the local flower plantation, especially when she sees her wages going to support her sister (Johanna Andrea Mora), a single mother. She discovers she's pregnant and when she admits to her feckless and spineless boyfriend (Wilson Guerrer) that she doesn't love him, she quits her job and escapes to Bogot&aacute; and the promise of a better future.<br /><br />On her way to the big city, she meets a young man who invites her to become a mule for drug traffickers, who want her to help them transport heroin to the United States by swallowing 62 drug-filled pellets. Her best friend Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega) wants to join her. Maria has to learn how to swallow the pellets containing heroin by practicing on grapes given to her by her mentor drug mule friend Lucy (Guilied Lopez). Maria feels scared and vulnerable but she's determined to go through with the plan and escape the life she's known.<br /><br />Maria Full of Grace never shies away from showing us the risk and danger of the drug transportation underworld. From the terrifying plane trip, where Lucy begins to get sick to the tense moments where some of the girls are hauled in by immigration officials in New York, the movie is absolutely gripping in its verisimilitude, The viewer sees how the pellets are made and how the women suppress the gag reflex and manage to swallow them, and also how they cope when the ultimately get to the United States.<br /><br />The film cleverly refuses to pass judgment on these girls and the choices that they make. Their desperation and flaws are apparent but their motivations are completely understandable. There's lots of unpredictable plot twists as Maria is forced to survive in a country where she doesn't speak the language, and where anxiety is a daily force. Moreno is a revelation as Maria - easily one of the best, most exciting performances of the year; she is indeed full of "grace." Mike Leonard September 04.</p></body></html>

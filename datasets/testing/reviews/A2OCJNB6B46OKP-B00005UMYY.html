A mans wife is killed and needs to seek out the killer and other people get thrown into the story. Now take that concept and show it to the movie going public....backwards! What you get is Christopher Nolans' masterpiece 'Memento'.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Eventhough you know exactly how the movie is going to end you are just waiting to see how the story got to that very point. A story like keeps you watching and thinking and that's probably why this movie is praised by millions. The cast is phenomenal and package is perfect. The funny thing is Nolan is now this huge director because of his re-inventing the Batman franchise. People may soon...forget that he was just as good of a director before that. That's why this film should be a true...memento for your collection. It is such an incredible movie it is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

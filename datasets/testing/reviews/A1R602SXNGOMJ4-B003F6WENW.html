<meta name="summary" content="Don't bother"></head><body><p>This movie started out well. Then it got long...too long. Plus it tried to go from funny guy movie to sappy chick flick. It didn't work. Owen Wilson's performance was disappointing. He was still much the same guy he is in his other movies, but this time he was also depressed and whinny for part of the movie. Also, there is no way to write a spoiler for this movie. It was totally predictable. If you read any of the summaries about this movie you can guess what's going to happen. There are no big surprises which isn't that surprising when you consider the type of film this is.<br /><br />My advice to the cast. Rachel, now that you've done something fun, go back to a part that endures as in THE NOTEBOOK. Vince, I think you've been typecast since SWINGERS. Some of your rapid funny lines were funny, like talking dirty to your girlfriend on the phone, but it's starting to get old. Find a dramatic role next time.<br /><br />If this movie manages to make any money, heaven help us, as that means there will be more of these morose cinematic insults to the public's intelligence to follow.</p></body></html>

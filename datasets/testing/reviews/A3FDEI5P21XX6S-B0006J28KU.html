<meta name="summary" content="Great film, good Blu"></head><body><p>Was just checking up on the Blu to verify one of my favorite films was given a decent transfer.<br /><br />The picture quality was solid, grainy in a few of the night interior shots (Ashley Judd's scenes with the trap house & cops shows some actual pores but when out of focus looks very grainy). The famous shoot out sequence looks valid, but the TrueHD seemed a little muted. The best sound test was when Studi's character shotguns the hotel door - that rocked. Overall, the Blu only shows the shortcomings of original filming but the upgrade is worth it (for the first time I noticed all of the cameramen/crew in the window shot when Deniro kills Fichtner's character).<br /><br />The supplements are all identical to the special edition release. They show 10 subtitled languages and no region coding listed. I am happy with the cut, and it will play nicely for sharing just not the best for sound. 5 for film, clarity and supplements.</p></body></html>

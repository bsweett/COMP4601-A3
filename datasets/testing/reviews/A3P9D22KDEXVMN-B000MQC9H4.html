The other stars in the movie were enjoyable.  My wife and I were somewhat split on this movie.  She thought the first half of the movie was a drag, while I thought the scenery and story were worthwhile.  The second half of the movie really took off.  I thought two pivotal plots helped make the movie very good.  The first was when Jack Black (always good) met and developed a relationship with Winslet's character.  The second was when we learned more about Jude Law's family.  The movie built a very strong momentum in the second half.  Had that been matched in the first half of the film, this would have been a 5 star flick.  As it is, this was an enjoyable film, with an intersting plot, made all the more enjoyable because of the movie's stars, especially Winslet and Black.  Four stars and recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Art Keeps Getting Better"></head><body><p>Well, it's happened again: another animated movie that can I describe "the greatest-looking animation I've ever seen!"  This has happened several times now in the past few years, and especially when they're available on a stunning Blu-Ray disc transfer.  (Note: three months after this, "UP" came out on Blu-Ray and surpassed this!! It just keeps getting better....)<br /><br /> I'm talking about the 2-D version, not the 3-D (which is not even in the same ballpark.) Forget the 3-D glasses and watch this as you would any other movi. You'll be extremely impressed at the colors and detail, and maybe just plain blown away by it all.<br /><br />Not only to the colors and detail dazzle, but the inventiveness here is really fun to watch and items change from one form or color to another. In parts, it reminded me of the old Beatles' "Yellow Submarine" with its colorful cleverness.<br /><br />To me, all of this made the story is secondary but that the latter isn't very interesting, too. The story is unique; quite different, with a good message getting everything you want not always being as attractive as that sounds.<br /><br />The minor characters in this story, by the way: such as "Mr. Bobinsky," "Miss Forcible" and "Miss Spink" - are a real hoot. and more fun than the main characters.  And - one last thing - adults mind find this more entertaining than kids.</p></body></html>

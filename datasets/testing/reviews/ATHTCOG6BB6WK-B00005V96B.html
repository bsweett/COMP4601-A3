The comedic flair of Monsters Inc. with Billy Crystal and John Goodman is sure to tickle your funny bone. Cycloptic Mike is so Crystal and I love it when he is so excited about being in a commercial and on the cover of a magazine that when his image is blocked, his enthusiasm remains. The bloopers at the end are funny too. The movie is fun for children and humorous for adults as well.</p></body></html>

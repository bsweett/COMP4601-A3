<meta name="summary" content="Modern War Classic"></head><body><p>I was thoroughly enthralled by "The Hurt Locker".  It's a war film without the absurd bravado and fake special effects.  Heroes like Sylvester Stallone and, in an earlier time, Ronald Reagan, are also completely absent.  If it's possible, it's an art house war film.<br /><br />The essence of the story revolves around the lives of a three man Explosive Ordinance Disposal team in Iraq.  Each of the men is very different. The team's leader, Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) is a war junkie.  He seems to love the adrenaline of the moment.  Unfortunately, this leaves him prone to rash and foolhardy decisions.  His two juniors, Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, are not happy with his approach; they are just counting down the days to when they can leave Iraq.  As the days count down, the team has many close shaves.  It is these close shaves that keep the viewer on edge.  Defusing ordinance requires great courage and a cool nerve.  The viewer feels the emotion by the bucket load.<br /><br />The essence of James' character is seen briefly near the conclusion of the film.  He has trouble adapting to civilian life.  He wants more of the adrenaline.  It is his lust for excitement that drives the movie.  It is a white knuckle ride at times.<br /><br />"The Hurt Locker" deserves an Oscar.  It is a modern war classic.  It also deserves a wider audience.  Perhaps a nod from the Academy will help it extend its reach?</p></body></html>

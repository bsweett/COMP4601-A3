I never intended to watch this film, but when a friend lent me the DVD I decided to go ahead and try it out, expecting an action flick with a simple plot, and not much else. Instead I found a superb story with enough intrigue and suspense to keep our interest intact throughout its duration, and some nice action to boot.<br /><br />The action takes place in the twenty-fifth century, 400 years after civilization was almost wiped out by a virus and only some survived thanks to a discovery by Trevor Goodchild. The survivors live in a fortified city called Bregna and are monitored at all times from a central command. There is a group, called Monicans, that believes that something is not right in this society, and they have sent Aeon to murder chairman Goodchild.  Up to this point, it all looks like straightforward science fiction, but when Aeon and Goodchild meet, things will get complicated, and a rich and enthralling storyline surfaces.<br /><br />There are several things I liked about this movie apart from its outstanding plot. The futuristic city presented in the film was craftily created, and I could not help feeling as if I was looking at a modern version of Ancient Rome. I also enjoyed the action scenes, which involve a considerable degree of acrobatic skill. In this sense, I would say that there were some similarities with "The Matrix", and even the story line can be thought of as comparable to this masterpiece. Finally, I think that Charlize Theron delivered a very good performance, which should put her in the short-list of successful female action figures, such as Lara Croft.<br /><br />It is always great when I start watching a movie without any expectations of it being very good and I end up having one hell of a time. People that enjoy science fiction with a good amount of action and complex plots will definitely have a similar experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Enjoyable Movie - Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>"Men In Black" is one of those very fun movies that can be watched over and over, and we just re-watched this before heading out to see the new "Men In Black 3" movie.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; The story is centers on "J" (Will Smith), NYPD detective and a newly recruited Agent to a top secret organization responsible for monitoring Aliens (as in from outer space) living on Earth. As might be expected, "J" brings a fresh attitude to the relatively stodgy establishment, including Agent "K" (Tommy Lee Jones) and the leader, Agent "Z" (Rip Torn). I liked that the pace of the movie was not overly rushed and they gave time for the characters to develop an on screen chemistry. The special effects were also quite good, considering when this movie was made.<br /><br />My whole family really enjoys this one!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

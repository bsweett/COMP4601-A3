<meta name="summary" content="A Bleak World Without Music Is Very Bleak Indeed"></head><body><p>Roman Polanski's simply outstanding film on the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), a Polish Jew and genius pianist who finds his love of Chopin and everything dear assaulted and destroyed by Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939.  A film based on the true life of Szpilman with an incredible screenplay, magnificent direction, first class acting, and great cinematography all combined together by Polanski's brilliant skills as a director.  This film deserved every Oscar it received.<br /><br />Not only does the film bring out the atrocious reality Poland encountered in WWII under Nazi occupation but it also shows the subleties of human nature in times of privation and war.  It shows that even in the bleakest of moments the human spirit is deprived indeed without art or music.  The film shows that human suffering is not merely a product of political ideology such as Nazism but more of individual evils that are not particular to race, nation, or religion.  Polanski demonstrates that Poland's misery was caused just as much by spineless Jewish and Christian collaborators as it was by the Nazis themselves.  The story also shows that many German officers were not the setereotypical Nazi thugs as shown in Spielberg's films but men of conscience trapped into an insanity that had gone beyond anyone's control and that could only be resolved through total war.<br /><br />This is simply a triumphant presentation by an extremely talented director.  Polanski's recreation of the Polish uprising is outstanding and shows the horror that Poland suffered throughout the war.  Few people realize that although approximately 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis, half of them were Polish and Poland lost an additional 2-3 million non-Jewish citizens making Poland equal in its losses than the Jewish peoples as a whole: Warsaw was virtually razed to the ground during the uprising!  I give my complements to him for depicting this little known fact with subtle yet powerful imagery.  Again, this is simply an outstanding film and certainly one of the best dramas on WWII and the Nazi atrocities in Poland in particular.  The film is a powerful vehicle in depicting a man's will to survive and his retaining both his humanity and hope through his love of classical music and the piano.  Don't miss this brilliant film!</p></body></html>

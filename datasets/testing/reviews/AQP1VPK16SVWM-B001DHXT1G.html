<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining action flick that reinvents character after disasterous "The Hulk""></head><body><p>The first thing you'll notice is that there are no giant poodles in "The Incredible Hulk". That's a good thing. While Ang Lee's first film had merit, it was flawed and we won't even discuss the silliness factor of a trio of giant dogs attacking Hulk in that film. Director Louis Leterrier's film manages to be both a smashing action film AND a bit of character study returning unashamedly to the comic book roots of the character. This is a fun popcorn flick with really good performances.<br /><br />The opening titles of the film give us a recap of how Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) became the Hulk ignoring the more complex origin of Lee's film. We catch up with Banner in South America working in a soda factory and working on a cure with the help of "Mr. Blue" a researcher in the United States. All it takes is a drop of blood in a contaminated soda bottle for General Ross (William Hurt) to locate Banner who he considers to be government property. Putting Blodsky (Tim Roth) a Russian born British soldier in charge of the retrieval, Ross and his team try and take Banner only to have him Hulk out on them.<br /><br />When "Mr. Blue" suggests that if he had all the data he might have a cure for him, Bruce Banner visits the only person that would have it--Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Unfortunately for Banner, General Ross manages to track him down and sents a genetically altered Blodsky after Banner with destructive results.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with great picture quality. In fact it's so good that you can see some scenes that should have been rendered in CGI a bit better than they were but weren't because of budget constraints. Nevertheless, "The Incredible Hulk" is a step up visually from Ang Lee's film from 2003 with Eric Bana with a ribbed but more realistic looking Hulk and his foe Abomination. The final showdown between the two of them combines CGI and miniature work nearly seamlessly.<br /><br />The extras include about 40 minutes of deleted/edited scenes including an alternate opening where Bruce treks to the Arctic and, supposedly, if you look really carefully you can see Captain America buried in the ice just before Banner Hulks out. The deleted scenes are in 480i.<br /><br />We also get a number of cool featurettes including two that show how they used motion capture and the actors to create their CGI counterparts in the film. There's also a "Making of" featurette (sponsered by Volkswagon!), a dossier that gives us information on the characters, picture-in-picutre (courtesy of Ucontrol)that allows you to compare scenes from the comic book that inspired scenes in the film as well as animatics and storyboards. The Blu-ray Live feature is also enabled for this disc so if you have a Playstation 3 you can go on line to discuss the film, etc. There's also a digital version of the film that you can load on to your PC and into iTunes or a Windows player if you so choose.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" may lack the angst of Ang Lee's film "Hulk" but it does make up for that lack of angst with a load of action. It's a pity that we didn't get the theatrical cut and Edward Norton's more character driven version as well on this set as that might have rivaled Lee's film in that department. It's hard to tell from the deleted scenes included here simply because they aren't integrated into the film. A lot were cut for good reason while some would have given the film additional depth.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" is a very good action flick that could have used a bit more character depth but even as presented it's a fun piece of entertainment that almost equals "Iron Man".</p></body></html>

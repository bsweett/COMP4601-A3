<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 STARS) Great Series Reduced to Average Actioner (But What Did You Expect from the New Director?)"></head><body><p>Many reviewers have already posted excellent reviews below, so I don't think I need to write down the entire story of the third `X-Men' film. The so-so story about the `cure' is interesting at first, but it is terribly oversimplified. And the return of Jean Grey (or Phoenix) is not a big surprise if you have seen the ending of the second `X-men' film very carefully. I only add to say that the two storylines, both of which I heard can be seen in the original comic in separate episodes, do not merge well.<br /><br />In other words, so many life-changing things happen to the characters, but the fast-paced film fails to be emotional when it should be most. Cyclops is reduced to Character # 1; Rogue is almost forgotten; and Jean Grey, Magneto, and other characters are all buried in the flood of eye-popping special effects.<br /><br />Many new characters are introduced, but except for Kelsey Grammer's perfect Dr. Hank McCoy, they are mostly forgettable, or treated as if disposable. They are all only the pixels among the costly CGI, and perhaps director Brett Ratner, who mercilessly Hollywoodnized Jackie Chan and his stunts in 'Rush Hour' series, thought the same way as Magneto, who coldly says they are just 'pawns' of the chess game.<br /><br />I admit the excellence of the visual effects. It is made as a big-budget summer blockbuster film, and it really is. But what made the first and second `X-Men' films different is missing here. You don't share the sadness of these characters, and you don't understand the complicated feelings that these characters expressed. Still you may be amazed by the special effects, but these amazing effects can be seen somewhere else, like `Fantastic Four.'</p></body></html>

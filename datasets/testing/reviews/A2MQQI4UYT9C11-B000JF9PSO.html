The theater was absolutely silent as the story of the 4th hijacked plane on September 11 ended with a blackened screen as United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Schwenksville, PA.  The use of unknown actors (including some actual participants at the various air and defense command centers) along with admirable dramatic restraint (the famous "let's roll" is whispered) by the director combine to put the viewer right in the middle of the most infamous day in recent history.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A superbly crafted thriller"></head><body><p>After scoring critical praise the world over with Memento, director Christopher Nolan was tapped to direct this remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.  Nolan suceeds where most other directors would have failed thanks to the brilliant cinematography and production design, giving the Alaskan setting and the overall film an atmospheric feel that sets Insomnia apart from other modern day thrillers.  Al Pacino is good as Detective Will Dormer who is after a killer (Robin Williams who is surprisingly effective in his role) and the two are great together in their game of cat &amp; mouse.  Hilary Swank however I felt was not effective at all until the climax of the film and for the most part was wasted in her role.  While the original Insomnia (which can be found as a Criterion Collection DVD) I find superior to this remake, this film is fantastic on it's own.  All in all, this was one of the best thrillers of 2002, and further cements Christopher Nolan as a visionary director.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Profound and inspiring!  A wonderful Civil War saga!"></head><body><p>This is a powerful and inspirational film dealing with a truly great Civil War story.  The 54th Mass. Volunteers was the first uniformed black regiment to fight in the Civil War.  The story here is wonderfully told, and the film pulls no punches about the prejudice and adversity that the soldiers of the 54th had to endure in order to get what white soldiers took for granted--acceptance by the rest of the Army as the fighting men that they were.<br /><br />The 54th was officered by white soldiers, and here Matthew Broderick puts in a fine performance as the Colonel of the regiment.  His eventual bonding with the men, and the mutual respect that gradually develops as the regiment congeals into a well-trained fighting force, is wonderfully done and quite inspirational.  Morgan Freeman does his customary stellar job as the regimental Sergeant Major, to whom the Colonel comes to look for insights about leadership and the problems of the men.  Denzel Washington (disclosure: this is one of my favorite actors) plays a signficant role as Private Trip, who enlists out of pride and the desire to prove he is the equal of anyone.  Trip refuses to accept the lesser pay afforded to black soldiers. White soldiers were paid $13/month, black soldiers $10.  It is a historical fact that many black soldiers refused to accept the $10, or any pay at all, until Congress eventually corrected this outrage.  The rest of the cast was quite good as well.<br /><br />The battle scenes in this film are incredibly good--in my opinion this sets the standard for how a battle should be done in a film.  The action never takes precedence over the plot, but I was quite literally absorbed by the intensity and the drama of both the first skirmish in which the regiment is blooded, and the later major assault in which the regiment is given the (nearly suicidal) lead position.<br /><br />This is a big budget film, and deserves every one of its five stars.  It features an inspiring story, excellent acting, lots of action, and realistic sets and battles.  What more can one ask?  This is one to which the discerning viewer will return many times.</p></body></html>

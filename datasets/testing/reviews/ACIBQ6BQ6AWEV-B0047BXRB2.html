<meta name="summary" content="Influential Film Is Surprisingly Static"></head><body><p>FORBIDDEN PLANET is certainly one of the most influential films of the 20th Century, containing an unusual story line, some remarkable concept art designs, a superior musical score, and a special effects robot that set the standard for science-fiction films for some thirty years and still continues to influence film makers today.  Unfortunately, the film is also a very static one, ultimately less interesting for any sense of excitement than for purely visual appeal.<p>In general, the story--which is famous for being very loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST--concerns a deep space mission helmed by Leslie Nielson sent to relieve colonists of a distant planet. Upon arriving, they find only two survivors: an inhospitable Walter Pidgeon and his beautiful daughter Anne Francis.  Pidgeon warns the relief mission against landing on the planet, lest the mysterious and evil force that destroyed the original colonists be once more unleashed, but land they do... and soon they too fall victim to an unseen but fearsome killer.<p>There are many marvelous things about the film.  The robot--suggested by Shakespeare's character Ariel--is truly the single most enjoyable element of the film, with much of the film's best lines and a memorable personality to boot.  Anne Francis--again suggested by Shakespeare's Miranda--gives quite a remarkable performance as a beautiful young woman raised without knowledge of mankind.  The art designs, whether of the lost alien civilization, the home in which Pideon and Francis live, or Francis' costumes, are stunning.  Even so...<p>Perhaps it is more a matter of passing time than anything else.  Both Nielson and Pidgeon's performances seem unnecessarily restrained and the cinematography is extremely static. The film as a whole seems to lack excitement and, although intriguing, the story itself is handled in a very conventional way.  Fans of classic science fiction cannot afford to be without FORBIDDEN PLANET, and most viewers will enjoy seeing it at least once, but for all its influence and visual beauty many may find that one viewing is enough.<p>Word of Warning: make absolutely certain that you are purchasing the widescreen version of the film, for the pan-and-scan seriously undercuts the film's visual appeal.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="even without the Rock, this still has action"></head><body><p>this movie was before the WWE star Rocky Johnson started acting. in the movie, Imhotep gets resurrected with one problem: a fear of cats. Beni turns weasel and starts helping Imhotep. he comes back to life and develops a crush on Evylyn, played by Rachel Weisz. this movie has plenty of action and bugs and would give anyone the creeps if they're not accustomed to it.</p></body></html>

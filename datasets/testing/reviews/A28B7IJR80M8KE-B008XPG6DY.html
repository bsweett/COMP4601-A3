<meta name="summary" content="A possible reality"></head><body><p>After you watch this, you will believe that it has likely happened to people, Clive Owen, who is one of the better actors to come along in ahwile is an average guy who many of us could identify with, he is an advertising executive who has a pretty wife(Melissa George) & a sick child, but the passion in his marriage has gone by the wayside, he then has a chance encounter with Lucinda(Jennifer Aniston), who is very attractive, & they have a fling, only to be alarmed by an intruder(Vincent Cassel, who is downright nasty & intimidating) in their hotel room, he not only robs & beats Owen, but rapes Anniston, if that wasn't bad enough, he harasses Owen throughout the film, threatning to expose their secret if not paid off, Owen conveys the emotion of a man whose life has gone from bad to worse, forget "Fatal Attraction", this is every cheating man's worst nightmare!!, & Anniston is very good in a slightly different role, who has a secret all her own, A very good thriller that will not bore you, why this film didn't do better is beyond me, the message is simple, "dont' fool around"!!!!!</p></body></html>

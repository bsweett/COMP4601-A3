Wonderfully directed by the acclaimed Sam Mendes (Academy Award Winner-Best Director-American Beauty). Don't let that scare you though! This film has no sexual nature to it at all. The R rating is due to pervasive disturbing violent content, and profanity is scarce. Tom Hanks gives the opposite performance than usual, as a killer and bankrobber. Jude Law and Paul Newman gave exceptional performances as well. The feature length was about 2 hours long, and certainly was not an action-packed, special effects thriller, rather a slower moving, yet still very interesting piece of art. Tom Hanks, who usually takes on very emotional characters, gave a rather unemotional performance, but there was a very subtle hint of the normal Hanks. As my closing comment, every aspect of this movie was perfect, and I can't wait until Feb. 25 to purchase the dvd.</p></body></html>

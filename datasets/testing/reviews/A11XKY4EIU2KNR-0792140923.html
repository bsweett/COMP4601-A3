Forrest Gump went to outer space and crash landed back on Earth on a deserted island. He got pulled into the space program for throwing his Medal of Honor at the capital and hitting a Senator in the head with it. Anyone who can sit and watch Tom Hanks act like this retard for more than 15 minutes at a time has got to be in a coma.</p></body></html>

Unless you're talking about a hot blonde chick named Liz, in which case, all bets are off!<br /><br />Speaking of betting.  There's a very cleverly done scene in "Next," where Johnson is winning a little too well at a blackjack table.  The guys with eyes in the sky send some goons down to muscle the prognosticating Johnson into the backroom, but he spends the next ten minutes ducking, dodging, spinning, and weaving through the casino with the casual elegance of a man who knows exactly where all of his pursuers will be at all times.  It's fun to watch, but there's also no real point to it.<br /><br />Starring Nicolas Cage (one of my favorite guilty pleasures) and a taking-it-waaaay-too-seriously Julianne Moore (as the bullheaded FBI agent Callie Ferris), "Next" is nothing but a premise on a platter.  Pretty much every scene that's even remotely engaging involves Cage dodging giant logs, winning fights without throwing a punch, or thoroughly searching three factory floors without ever taking a step.  I'll admit, it's cool, but it's also the same "cool," over and over again.<br /><br />But there's a lot here that's not that cool.  Like the you-gotta-be-kidding-me love story.  Or the cheesy Russian villains.  Or Cage's hairdo.  (First <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBEO">Ghost Rider</a> and now this.  What, these films can't afford hair stylists?  The poor guy looks like he's wearing a hood without the sweatshirt.)<br /><br />But the biggest not-cool of them all, and the reason I dropped my rating down to two stars, is the flatline of a finish, a pathetic wrap-up that, quite literally, gives one the impression that they have just watched a movie that was never meant to be finished.  It's one thing to give an audience a gimmicky premise and, for emotional resonance, attach the threat of a nuclear bomb (who ISN'T afraid of those things?).  It's another thing to take all of that resonance (what little there is) and trash it for one last play on the gimmick.  It may be hard to believe, but this flick has no resolution, has no ending, and nothing is solved.<br /><br />I wondered, walking out of the theatre, why I didn't see it coming.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Powerful film!"></head><body><p>This long film (by today's standards) is riveting at all times, thanks to the vision and control of Paul Thomas Anderson. It's been said that Daniel Day-Lewis only re-channelled his performance as Bill the Butcher (Gangs of New York), but here he's in almost every scene, and the performance is as complete as it can get; the nastiest performance to win an Oscar since Hannibal Lechter or Aileen Wuornos.  He deserved the Oscar. I longed for some information regarding Mr. Plainview's previous history, and the appearance of Kevin J. Dillon as his step-brother was a great sub-plot. It's the only time Plainview showed any concern for anyone but himself. None of it turns out good. Rehashing the plot wouldn't make sense, but this is a finely crafted film, rich in detail and excellent cinematography. I also enjoyed Paul Dano (L.I.E.; Little Miss Sunshine), who showed range of character throughout. One argument is that the 2-disc DVD is inadequate, regarding Disc 2, and that is correct. Most interviews are repetitive, and it included some old documentary footage of the importance of oil...duh...?! Anyway, it's a worthy film. Check it out!</p></body></html>

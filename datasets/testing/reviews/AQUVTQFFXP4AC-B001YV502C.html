<meta name="summary" content="The greatest, grittiest, realest, and most heart-wrenching movie I've seen all year"></head><body><p>When going to see Children of Men, I had little to low opinion upon it.  The trailers did not at all do this justice, painting it instead as some sort of typical dystopian sci-fi action thriller with lots of chase scenes and explosions.<br /><br />What I got instead was not only brilliantly acted, but incredibly gritty and realistic, and save for the light leap of faith required in believing that all people would become infertile within 20 years, completely realistic.<br /><br />Clive Owen (Theo) is absolutely perfect as the 40-something man who sneaks scotch into his coffee and carries it around all day, uses Baby Diego's death (youngest person on earth, 18) as an excuse to skip work and hang out with his buddy Jasper (Michael Caine), and has virtually nothing left to live for after his daughter's death and his divorce, who gradually becomes a man with a purpose to get Kee (the pregnant girl) to Africa, where the Human Project awaits her.<br /><br />The scenes which show the dystopian future are elegantly done to show just how far society has fallen as infertility rose among the world, without lingering too much or being overly brutal on the senses.  Seeing rioters hurl stones at a moving train Theo is in, or a bomb go off in a London coffee shop is so unthinkable in this day and age and yet shot so realistically it's almost as if watching it through a documentary camera.<br /><br />It's interesting and somewhat disturbing to see the way immigrants to Britain are treated, strikingly similar to the way of Jews in Nazi Germany, and yet with the same tone and anti-immigrant sentiment in the country as modern-day United States, as when Theo and the others sneak into a refugee camp, Kee's friend is brutalized by the British guards for not following orders fast enough, and taken outside with a burlap sack put over her head.<br /><br />The last scene in the movie, the battle sequence in an immigrant camp building, shot all in one take, is the most powerful scene of the whole movie, and I had tears in my eyes watching it, just seeing the reactions of the people on screen, and the emotional power and brilliance of the scene.  The cinematrography, the sound, the picture, the acting, everything was just perfect.<br /><br />All in all, Children of Men was in my opinion the best movie of all in 2006, and it's a shame it didn't win any awards of importance.</p></body></html>

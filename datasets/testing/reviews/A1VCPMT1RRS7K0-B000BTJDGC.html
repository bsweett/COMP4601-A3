<meta name="summary" content="What Happened to Emily?"></head><body><p>I was expecting, based on the commercials I'd heard and seen on the radio and television, a film that would be insanely disturbing and unsettling.  The point of this story runs far deeper than gore and disturbing imagery could conjure.<br /><br />This movie is extremely well produced and performed - and it plays on our fear of possibility.  We've all heard stories of forms of possession and exorcism - never knowing what truly happened in these instances.  This allows the viewer to be drawn into the movie.  The mysterious occurrances portrayed will no doubt stir our suspicions.<br /><br />The courtroom setting utilized brings these unearthly and mysterious elements into the "real world"; the world where reason is supposed to dictate what is perceived as truth.  This exposes us to the ways in which people react to the telling of such experiences.  We are then left to form our own conclusions, drawing on our beliefs and fears: the belief of what is possible and our fear of those very things actually happening to people.  All of this makes for great entertainment and great reflection.  Expecting a film to disturb and rattle me, I was unprepared for what I was exposed to.<br /><br />The DVD contains 3 featurettes: Genesis of the Story, Casting the Movie and Visual Design.  These lengthy featurettes give great insight into the film's production, from the origins of the desire to create a film based on the real life experiences of Anneliese Michel to the means by which the filmmakers visually created the world of torment Emily Rose suffered.  All elements were carefully chosen in creating the "look" of the recalled scenes of Emily's experiences.  Great attention was paid to the color, lighting, sound and dialogue of these scenes - all of which is discussed in the featurette.  There is also a deleted scene included in the special features which wouldn't have done much for the film had it been included.<br /><br />This film did not turn out to be what I had expected, yet it entertained me in a different way and had effects that lasted beyond the viewing of the movie.  It will please fans of horror movies, thrillers, dramas, etc...</p></body></html>

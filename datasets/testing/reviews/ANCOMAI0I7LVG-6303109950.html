I mean, back in '93, this was considered a lukewarm gunslinger and really only gained praise for Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holiday.  Now, you won't find many who would put this down.  In fact, I've had many a friend tell me not to bother wasting time on the '94 film `Wyatt Earp' and only watch `Tombstone', which they all claim to be superior.  Of note, `Wyatt Earp' actually received an Oscar nomination for its cinematography, a feat that `Tombstone' couldn't manage; but it also racked up five Razzie nominations (winning two), another feat that `Tombstone' didn't attain.<br /><br />I haven't seen `Wyatt Earp'.<br /><br />It has taken me quite a while to finally see `Tombstone', but nestling onto the couch this past weekend to indulge in yet another `manly' film I'm required to like had me questioning my manhood yet again.  I mean, this happened when I watched `Braveheart' and got to thinking that it was a beautifully shot soap opera wrecked with vapid excuses for stereotypes.  My friends berated me and the Ammy community took strike against my three star review.  Watching `Tombstone' felt roughly similar in that it felt completely void of any real point.  It was just another gunslinger with big names and no real dissection of character.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I like my films to SAY something about the subject they embody.  Films that exist solely to show a montage of action sequences don't do a thing for me.  When you litter those action scenes with horrifically amateurish acting, I have an even bigger problem.<br /><br />So, while watching the film I couldn't help but imagine ways in which this film could have been something better.  First, the only great performance here is Val Kilmer.  The fact that he was Oscar snubbed (really snubbed of everything except two MTV Movie award nominations, one for `Most Desirable Male' which only tells me that the voting body, most likely consisting of teenage girls, didn't actually watch this movie and merely voted for him because he's Val Kilmer, since his sickly interpretation of Doc Holiday is anything but desirable) is a true testament to the mundane quality of the film itself.  He is surrounded by average to mediocre to just plain awful acting.  Kurt Russell tries, but ultimately fails to bring anything remotely `true' to his portrayal of Wyatt Earp.  I mean, he look ridiculous and then goes all banshee at the end, which feels so forced and silly ("The law is coming!").  Sam Elliott kind of survives this with his grumble, but he's somewhat forgettable.  Forgettable is a godsend when you consider that Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn are unforgettably horrible in this movie.  UGH, and to think I used to have some sort of man crush on Bill Paxton and `wanted' to see him movies.<br /><br />Just...no.<br /><br />As far as the film itself, the scripting is somewhat skeletal.  I never felt like I really knew who these men were.  They are just kind of there and yes, they are tough.  Doc Holiday is the only character who feels lived in, and a lot of that is due to the way that Kilmer embodies the man.  He really drives this film.  The lovelorn triangle between Earp, his drug addicted wife and the pretty actress is domineering and foolishly handled and I just wish it had been ripped from the film entirely.  I know that it is somewhat representative of fact, but if you can't flesh it out to where it feels genuine then don't bother representing it at all.  The final scene alone made me want to barf it was so pathetic.  Seriously.  We run out into the street and laugh?  That leads me to the awfully clich&eacute;d score.  I hated it.<br /><br />So, see this for Kilmer.  Or just don't see it.</p></body></html>

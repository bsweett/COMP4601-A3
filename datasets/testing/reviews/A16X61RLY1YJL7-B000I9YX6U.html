<meta name="summary" content="One Hour Photo - One highly suspenseful and enjoyable film!"></head><body><p>Given the backdrop of the local SavMart and the stunning performance of Robin Williams, this film is a deeply scary thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat all the way through; whether it's out of complete fear of what his character will do next or the embarrassment he faces for his actions.<p>This is most certainly Robin Williams scariest role to date and one in which he's least like himself as he's completely suppressed his comedic nature for the almost clinical persona of Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parish.  He certainly deserves any and all accolades he earns from this film.  Connie Nielsen performs admirably in this film as well.<p>In his feature film directing debut, Mark Romanek has written and directed a pure psychological thriller masterpiece.  From the simple concept of looking at a SavMart like store and coming up with this script, he has shown an amazing talent.  This is a director whose films are to be looked out for in the future.<p>The soundtrack for this film is also quite dead on with every sequence and adds beautifully to the suspenseful nature of the film.<p>The premise:<p>Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parish (Robin Williams) works at the local SavMart as the photo technician.  He's been working there for eleven years and in a large sense he has no life other than his job.  During his daily routine at work, he sees everybody's lives, or more succinctly, their more joyful moments, in the pictures they bring in to be developed.  Somewhere along the line he has become thoroughly infatuated with one particular family, the Yorkins.  Sy even fantasizes about being Uncle Sy in the Yorkin family.<p>When Sy suddenly suffers a catastrophic event in his life, he essentially flips all the way off of the rocker and what follows from there simply has to be one of the most suspenseful thrillers that this viewer has watched in quite some time.<p>I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre; it will make an excellent addition to your DVD library and will stand up quite well to multiple viewings.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>- Writer, Director and Actor Commentary<br />- &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; Sundance Channel Featurette<br />- &quot;Making of&quot; Featurette<br />- &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; Interview with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek<br />- Theatrical Trailer and TV Spots</p></body></html>

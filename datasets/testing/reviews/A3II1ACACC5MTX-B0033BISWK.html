Now we have Arabs, the British and South Africans taking the traditional role of the Russians prior to the break up of the cold war.<br /><br />The fact that the central character is so unlikable, and has the name Wikus (I could only think of Michael Palins Pilate in Life of Brian saying "Wikus Dickus") is a masterstroke, why should films have a likeable star just to make everyone feel all warm and lovely about themselves. Sometimes, stuff happens to those who aren't Brad Pitt or Matt Damon types and they have to deal with it as best they can.<br /><br />Also an interesting counterpoint is the fact that the black population is as enthusiastic as subjugating the aliens as the white, perhaps not seeing their own history reflected in the plight of the "Prawns", it must be remembered that the spaceship arrived in Jo'burg when Apartheid was still at its height, and some back-story perhaps integrating the arrival of the ship into the breakdown of that social system might have strengthened the story a little.<br /><br />Which brings me to my biggest gripe, the lack of back-story isn't critical in this film, but would have added a lot to my enjoyment of the film, where did they come from, why did they come to earth, why were they in such a poor state when they got here, why didn't they defend themselves against the humans with their advanced weapons?<br /><br />This is overall, however, a film about human nature, and could be transplanted across our globe and throughout our history when a dominant society subjugates a submissive one, and as such makes provoking and interesting viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great small film and marketing done right"></head><body><p>For once, here's a small, low budget film done justice by its excellent marketing campaign.  First, my compliments to whoever designed the movie poster - to the uninitiated, it would appear that Catalina Sandrino Moreno's 'Maria' is about to receive Holy Communion - a perfect juxtaposition in devoutly Catholic Colombia.  Those who've seen the stark, no punches trailer know that Maria is receiving a baptism of a far different sort.<br /><br />I often get frustrated when a powerful film like 'East Is East' is marketed here as a 'breezy charmer' (no lie - that was the campaign for a movie that was anything but).  So, I'm obligated to note when a movie and its marketing efforts respect the intelligence of its viewing audience.  Thank you, HBO Films.  And thanks, too, for taking a bet on writer/director Joshua Marston despite his brief biography.  Good to see that HBO continues to recognize that the best ideas don't always come out of the Hollywood enclave.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie works because of Catalina Sandrino Moreno's brilliant performance.  You have to believe her naivet&eacute;, and for the ability of this 23-year-old to pull off a performance as a doe-eyed 17-year-old.  How/why could anyone become a mule, you ask?  'Maria' makes you see how a person could find themselves compelled to make such a choice.<br /><br />'Maria' is also notable for its excellent depiction of the Colombian immigrants' support system in New York City, featuring a wonderful performances from Orlando Tobon as "Don Fernando" - a one-man office source of job leads, explainer of the U.S. legal system and all-around 'shoulder to lean on' for 'Colombians en el Exterior' in his neighborhood.  Given that Sr. Tobon is also Associate Producer, I suspect 'Don Fernando' is not too far from the role he plays in real life.</p></body></html>

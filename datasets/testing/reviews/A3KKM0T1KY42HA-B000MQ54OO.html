<meta name="summary" content="Could There Be More 2007 CGIs Than 2006 CGIs?....You Can Bet Your Happy Feet There Will!"></head><body><p>Something about singing and dancing captivates young children. Happy Feet is full of singing and dancing...at least half of the movie are happy songs and tapping (happy) feet. So my kids, especially my 3 year old, are happily captivated.<br /><br />Happy Feet is another in the 13, count 'em, 13 CGI movies of 2006. It's a feel-good movie with the ever popular, ever familiar theme of "Judge One Not By His Differences To You And Your Social Circle". It's a nice family film with the all-important adult-asides. But nothing too grown up that kids would pick up on.<br /><br />The picture is just awesome; this computer-generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.<br /><br />There are lots of popular actors lending their voices to Happy Feet, and there are lots of popular songs that everyone can sing along to. Happy Feet is a good movie that you throw in the DVD player and snuggle up with the kids to watch, and your younger kids will want to watch it over and over and over....That's enough added value and incentive right there to add it to your cart.<br /><br />But, in my humble opinion, Happy Feet isn't one of the top 3 of the 13 2006 CGI movies. Maybe it's the overkill of computer animation in 2006 that just didn't get me as excited for Happy Feet by the time it was released at the end of the year as I was for some of the others released earlier in the year.<br /><br />I think the top 3 CGIs of 2006 were, in order: Ice Age 2, The Ant Bully and Cars. But who cares what I think? It's all about the kids, and the kids loved Happy Feet.<br /><br />And in case you were wondering...the 13 CGI movies of 2006 were: Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, The Ant Bully, Hoodwinked, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away.<br /><br />Choose your own top 3.</p></body></html>

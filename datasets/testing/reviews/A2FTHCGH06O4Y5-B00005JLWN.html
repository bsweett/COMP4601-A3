It seemed like a thinly-veiled ripoff of the "books are banned" premise from Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.  Only there, the premise worked.  Here, the premise is that emotion has been banned.<br /><br />I couldn't buy this for a second.  According to the movie, emotion is caused by things such as old lamps, paintings, and carpets.  In reality, since emotions are caused by, say, having a baby, getting a promotion at work, watching the rain in the afternoon, whatever -- they would be difficult to ban.  Or, if they wanted to ban them, they'd have to go about it in an entirely different way from the method employed in this movie:  antique sofas are now banned, so the public won't be emotional?<br /><br />Beyond that, there was a lot of unnecessary kung-fu, whose connection to the issue of emotional suppression raised by the plot was not clear to me.</p></body></html>

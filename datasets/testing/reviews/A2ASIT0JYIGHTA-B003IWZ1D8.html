<meta name="summary" content="Great, but dated"></head><body><p>Psycho is an over-rated film which has won critical acclaim because of its shower scene. That scene was particularly daring back in the 1960's when the film was made.  A nearly nude janet leigh was the reason! Interesting trivia is that this scene comprised over 100 different camera angles.<p>Like many of Hitchcock's films, Psycho suffers from having a very 'dated' feel about it.  The characters seems stiff too.  Anthony Perkins is creepy however, and his performance is worth seeing for the film alone.</p></body></html>

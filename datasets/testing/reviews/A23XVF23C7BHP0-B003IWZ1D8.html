<meta name="summary" content="Watch it, re-watch it, and re-watch it!"></head><body><p>Little can be added to the hundreds of reviews that tell you how good Leigh and Perkins are in their roles, how their innocent facades belie their hidden feelings of guilt, how Hitchock wisely shies away from showing us too much, and lets our imaginations frighten us instead, so instead I will concentrate on a couple of amusing continuity errors I haven't seen anyone mention before. Firstly in the shower scene (filmed over several days) Leigh's hair changes from shot to shot. Second, in the scene in the Sherriff's house, the Sheriff's wife acts 'understanding' by tipping her head to one side. This would be fine, but every time there is a cut (and there are many) her head is at a different angle!<br />These are of course tiny niggles and the film is deservedly known as a masterpiece.<p>Just one more thing. If you listen to the music in I Know What You Did Last Summer, made as recently as 1997, you can tell how enduring and powerful an influence Bernard Hermann's score for Psycho is, as certain parts are near-identical.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slow-paced yet mesmerizing; Depp and Graham shine."></head><body><p>Those expecting a good scare in the vein of Wes Craven will be sorely disappointed in &quot;From Hell,&quot; the latest take on the infamous Jack the Ripper, done in a style of elegant and yet so perverse that one cannot help but become wrapped up in this dark yet absorbing tale. The latest film from the Hughes Brothers is a gossamer blanket of elegant settings crossed with the depraved regions of the darkest of human thoughts, with inklings of the psychological and conspiracy. <p>The story seems to be aimed more at those who know little about the history of Jack the Ripper, putting a fictional spin on the events leading up to the still-unsolved case involving a series of notorious murders in London's Whitecastle district. In this degraded section of the capital, prostitutes fill the streets, five of which form a tightly knit group of friends. At the center of these women is Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who will become the love interest to Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), who is assigned to the cases of the murders. <p>Of course, Abberline has more connection to the gruesome events than he wishes. His dreams allow him to foresee the crimes before they happen, a plot point that doesn't quite reach fruition by film's end. His psychological connection to the events is never really capitalized on, and since there is really no need for it, what there is in the film seems out of place. <p>The movie also takes its time to generate some momentum, and some will find the sequence of events boring rather than interesting. This is no a whodunit in the traditional sense: the clues in the beginning are less intriguing than those towards the end, and the action is almost null. I consider this to be one of the film's attributes, taking its time in delivering small clues that will lead to larger ones, while keeping the cheap thrills at a minimum. <p>As the plot progresses, it begins to generate some genuine suspense. From the murder scenes, Abberline begins gathering his physical evidence, from things such as grape branches to the smell of expensive alcohol on the victims' lips. He discovers that the women killed by the Ripper compose the circle of friends to which Mary belongs, making it more of a personal vendetta, a particularly effective angle once the final act begins. <p>This new working of the legendary serial killer is quite a stylish trip, I must say, boasting some of the most impressive visual scenes of this year. Scenes that reveal the glory of London soon transform into the degradation and run-down conditions of the poor sectors, while the murder scenes have the good taste to keep most of the gruesome, gory detail hidden from view. The recreation of London in the 19th century is meticulous and bursting with authenticity, a lavish set and costume design achievement. <p>The underlying mystery also keeps things moving at a reasonable pace, and those who enjoy exposition over thrills will find it rather interesting. It sparks a new twist that involves many of London's highly regarded officials, even a figure of royalty. As the beginning begins to unfold, nothing seems to fit together, but as the story progresses, the pieces become clearer. Most importantly, it keeps its surprises well hidden, making them that much more effective once they are revealed. <p>Johnny Depp is back in fine form, and his performance here is sure to remind audiences of his spectacular acting in Tim Burton's &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot; In Abberline, he plays the same kind of character, but with an edgier lifestyle, and a more straightforward attitude. It's good to see Heather Graham in a genre that befits her talent; comedy doesn't seem to be her strong suit, but her role as Mary in this film allows her to give us a wonderful performance. She and Depp share a terrific offbeat chemistry, one that makes the movie's bittersweet resolution for the two deeply affecting. <p>I've never really known much about the legend of Jack the Ripper short of seeing &quot;From Hell,&quot; and even I have my doubts about its historical accuracy in regards to the sequence of events leading to the fictional twist in the end. Even still, the film is bursting with elements of the macabre and the gothic, and carries a well-suited cast to pull off a nicely paced plot; this is a pretty impressive production.</p></body></html>

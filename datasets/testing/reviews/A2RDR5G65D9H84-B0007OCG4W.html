A compelling script. Therefore, the overall result is not good at all, because no matter how hard Portman, Roberts, Law and Owen try, there is nothing they can do with the dull and overly depressing script they have to work with.<br /><br />The story starts when Dan (Law) meets an extroverted New Yorker in London. Alice (Portman) used to work as a stripper in the Big Apple and ran away looking for a new start. A relationship starts building, but when Anna (Roberts), a professional photographer, crosses their path, things start to get complicated. And when Larry (Owen), a dermatologist, finds Anna as the result of a prank played on him, the four characters get entangled in a web of relationships that gets boring fast and drags the movie into a limbo, in which it remains until the end.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the only aspect of this movie I consider to be praiseworthy is the acting, but for someone that is looking to be entertained for a couple of hours that is not enough. I think Jude Law deserves to be recognized, especially after he was made the target of aggressive jokes at the Oscars, and in this case he shows once more his gifts for acting. It is a shame the script is so bad!</p></body></html>

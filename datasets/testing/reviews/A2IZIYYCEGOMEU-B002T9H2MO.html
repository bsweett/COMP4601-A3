<meta name="summary" content="A SLOW-BURN WITH A GOOD PAYOFF"></head><body><p>This film is more of a psychodrama than most sci-fi, and though it does have elements of 2001, SOLARIS, and OUTLAND, it isn't a clone of any of them. Sam Rockwell delivers a superb performance as an astronaut in the 'near' future, that may, or may not be going nuts, and may, or may not be alone during the last few weeks of a 3-year hitch, harvesting helium on the darkside of the moon. There are no big shoot-em-ups, no CGI-heavy effects, and the action is more internal than external. It may not be quite a classic of the genre, but it is definitely worth seeing a few times.</p></body></html>

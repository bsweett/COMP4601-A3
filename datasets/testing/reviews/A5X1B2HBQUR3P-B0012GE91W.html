<meta name="summary" content="A mature movie for a mature book. Harry has grown up."></head><body><p>A darker movie than even year 4 due to intrinsic story being dark in the first place. Also the director is differnt in this one and  here is not as operatic and gothic as in goblet of fire. The movie and book pretty much enter the xmen mode where you can sense this movie is the preparation for the big battle between the dumbledore army and the voldemort army in the next 2 books and movies. So its like a movie which sets the stage for a larger showdown. So although there is a showdown in the end, you know that this movie is a passage to the next and final one. The movie deviates from the end of the book and rightly so. The book did not have  dumbledore  returning for the final fight with Voldemort but in the movie he does return back. In the book he Vanishes when Cornelius Fudge attempts to arrest him to move him to Azkaban. The guys are all more grown up and look cooler. The costumes are nicer and chic. The movie is greyer and devoid of color than the previous films.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

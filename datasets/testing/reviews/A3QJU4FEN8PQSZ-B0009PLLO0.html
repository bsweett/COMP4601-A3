And it gets there slowly.<br /><br />The plot is a mess. Stone can't decide who Alexander is. He's not terribly brilliant a commander - or is he? He can't seem to inspire his men - or can he? And when he does, is it on purpose? And when he fails, with a limpid speech, is that really him, or not? And what of his grand vision? Not much of that shown. And he can't persuade his men that it's a grand vision.<br /><br />Not that I blame them. Colin Farrell looks ridiculous in his half-blond hair and nostrils flaring. It just distracts from the film and makes you think, couldn't they have spent more on makeup?<br /><br />Only Val Kilmer is somewhat worth watching in his limited role as King Philip. The battle scenes are not as good as some reviews would have you expect, although the sight of charging elephants is somewhat awesome; and that crimson effected battle is just an eyesore.<br /><br />It fails to capture Alexander's vision and triumph, and portrays him as a boyish simperer. Yuck.</p></body></html>

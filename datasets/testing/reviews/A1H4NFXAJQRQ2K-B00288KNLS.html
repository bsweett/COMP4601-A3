If you are a parent thinking this is for children, watch it first perhaps then decide wether or not your child should view it since some of the imagery and storyline might seem too horrific/dark. The stop animation really pops in HD. The only thing I didn't care for was the one brief musical type song the "other father" broke into at one point in the movie... it was just a week song, and if you're going to do a musical then you have to fully commit to it, and... Don't hire Danny Horrible Song Writer Elfman to do it as in The Corpse Bride etc. But that's another topic altogether.</p></body></html>

I am not very familiar with Bobby Darin...but this story was very interesting and really kept me interested in what it had to say.  Thanks to imdb.com's trivia, it is found that this story was in the making for almost 20 years, and through many rewrites, and many cast considerations, they were able to come out with something veryenjoyable!!  GREAT story!!<br /><br />Christopher Berry</p></body></html>

This movie still confuses me a bit but the writing, acting, and plot is top-notch in every way.  The chemistry between Reeves and Bullock is explosive, you truly believe they are in love, too bad they never fell for each other behind the scenes. The premise of the film is Kate (Bullock) lives in the year 2006 and Alex (Reeves) lives in the year 2004 and they develop a deep and powerful relationship but they are living two years apart so how can they be destine to be together, well you just have to see this one to find out. And keep your ears open to the beautiful ballad Kate and Alex slowdance to, This Never Happened Before by Sir Paul McCartney, it's magical. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="JEREMY RENNER, ROBERT CARLYLE ARE GREAT IN THIS"></head><body><p>28 WEEKS LATER<br /><br />I was extremely excited about this movie when it was first announced because one of my favorite actors ever Jeremy Renner. I have always liked him especially his performance in the great flick Dahmer. So when this first came out I was really excited but this did not turn out as great as I thought. Still the movie was fun and had a bit of that appeal that the first did although I think it was trying to hard to live up to the first. Renner definitely is what makes this movie for me, and once again they are infected not zombies.<br /><br />The second film follows a some people who get stuck within an infected zone after an infected gets loose, the husband and wife. These people are being lead by a solider who feels sorry for them and disobeys orders and even shoots his fellow soldiers. They have to make it all the way across town to try to get a lift out of the quarantined zone. They have to out last a lot of infected, soldiers, napalm and all kinds of things. This one unlike the last film is a straight survival film were as the last was a mix of all kinds.<br /><br />This movie seemed well directed and written for the most part but it seemed like they were trying to out do the last film more so than further the story. Don't get me wrong I love when the helicopter starts to chop away at the infected but did it feel a little like the studio was involved in stuff like that. To me the story seemed great at first but towards the last half it did not seem as developed. In fact the first half felt very much like the first film but it started to falter towards the end a little. Acting wise Jeremy Renner is brilliant but I was a little disappointed with the fate of his character, Robert Carlyle is also great in this.<br /><br />I liked this second film and found it to be a fun flick but it did not seem as real as the first or even as fun. The story was good and the acting was good but it just fell a little short in my opinion. I would still recommend a purchase especially if you have the first one but a rental at least could be good for this one. Look for the two pack if you do not already own these because it is a good deal for the two films.</p></body></html>

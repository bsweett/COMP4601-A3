<meta name="summary" content="A solid movie.  Flawed as hell, but solid."></head><body><p>Considering this movie got made for $10 million bucks, it's better than it should be.  That's meant to be a compliment, by the way.  The DVD is pretty good (considering censoring on the commentaries and the missing documentary from...um, well let's just call them Di$ney), and includes an hour and a half of deleted stuff (a lot of continuity issues are addressed here, and a few scenes would have been nice to see in the film's release), plus there are some insanely funny outtakes (Matt Damon's theories on &quot;Star Wars&quot; seal the deal for me).  Add to that some rather funny menus (feel guilty for buying this DVD with the opinions of a elderly &quot;church-goer&quot;) and some funny commentaries from the cast and crew, and you got a &quot;must-buy&quot; for fans of the film.</p></body></html>

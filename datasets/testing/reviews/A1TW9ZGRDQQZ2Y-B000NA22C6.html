<meta name="summary" content="One of Depp's Best Performances on a Very Good Dvd!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie in theater and liked it a lot, so it's no surprise that I went out and bought it today. It may not say Special Edition on the cover, but this Dvd has as many extras as most Deluxe Edtions. The Featurettes are interesting and informative and run over an hour combined. My favorite being the Secrets Revealed segment that really helps put certain things in place and make sense after viewing the film for the first time. Now to Mr. Johnny Depp! Depp has been one of my favorite actors long before Jack Sparrow came out into public view, and the performance as Mort in this little film ranks #2 of all his roles in my opinion (Right behind &quot;Pirates of the Carribean&quot; of couse). The supporting cast, direction, and music are very strong as well. It's just nice to see a thriller that takes its time to build up to the twisted conclusion, without the mindless gore (which at times is good) and the paper thin characters. The casual and huge Johnny Depp fans who enjoy a good psychological thriller should buy this one, everyone else should at least rent it to see what an amazing actor they have been missing.</p></body></html>

The main character in the comic and the film is John Constantine, a chain smoking British mystic who gets involved with angels, demons and thing that go bump in the night and the day.<br /><br />Fans of the comic (like me) will like the special effects filled story centering around the war between Heaven and Hell and the discovery of an artifact called the "Spear of Destiny". I was glad to see a truly "R" rated film, after seeing so many tame PG-13 horror flicks. The main issue with Constantine: "Can Keanu play a convincing Constantine?" My answer: Yes he can, but not the Constantine from the comic.<br /><br />Other critics called the plot "confusing"; I don't get this one. The plot is very simple, I guess these critics would go into convulsions if they read a Constantine comic!<br /><br />Bottom line: the extremely negative reviews are bogus, trust critics who review horror films on a regular basis.</p></body></html>

But Roth knows what's he's doing, and has created a truly horrific situation with even more horrific consequences. The underlying backstory to why this is happening is evil in itself; Hard to watch and even harder to listen to at times, 'Hostel' demands your attention. It's smart and has something to offer for what it is. And without saying too much, this movie contains payback. Everybody somehow gets a little kharma coming back to them...The acting is pretty good considering the amount of screaming and pleading they have to do, and alot of the violence is more suggested. Could have done without the eye scene, though...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Incredible film, if you can handle ambiguity"></head><body><p>I saw &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; in the theater when it came out, and I remember thinking it was incredible. I also remember hearing lots of complaining from the other people in the theater on the way out. Basically this is a film you'll either love or hate. I think when it came out, people were disappointed because they were expecting a traditional &quot;erotic thriller&quot;, which this is not. This is a subtle, dreamlike, and very ambiguous film that explores jealousy, sexuality, death and the subconscious. I don't think most moviegoers (at least not Americans) are really comfortable with ambiguity in a film. They want clear, linear stories. But a film like &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, to me, is the opposite of an insult to one's intelligence, because it leaves many of the questions of the film up to the viewer to decide for himself. It is widely known that Stanley Kubrick finished this film right before his death. After watching &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, it occured to me that this film may have been his way of communicating that even close to death, life is still made up of many more questions than answers.</p></body></html>

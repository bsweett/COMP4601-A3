<meta name="summary" content="Affleck and Freeman give solid, commanding performances!"></head><body><p>It's like this. Some or all of us have read the novels by Tom Clancy, or have seen the Clancy films such as "The Hunt for Red October", "Patriot Games", and "Clear and Present Danger". Well, "The Sum of All Fears" is no exception as you add this to that list! The direction of Phil Alden Robinson ("Sneakers", "Field of Dreams") was superb in every way possible! The performances of Ben Affleck ("Changing Lanes") and Morgan Freeman ("High Crimes") couldn't be better! The film talks about how one nuclear weapon comes up missing from a total of 27,000. It is up to CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Affleck) and CIA Director Bill Cabot (Freeman) to uncover the plot or else, it's World War III!! "The Sum of All Fears" also talks about how fear can escalate to paranoia in this world today due to the fact of wars and nuclear weapons. To me, Ben Affleck is the absolute best Jack Ryan since Harrison Ford in "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger", and Alec Baldwin in "The Hunt for Red October"! And when I watched "The Sum of All Fears", I would like to think of this as a prequel to the first 3 films because of Jack Ryan being a little young in this film. With two extraordinary actors, a great supporting cast including James Cromwell ("The General's Daughter"), Liev Schreiber ("Kate & Leopold"), and Bridget Moynahan ("Serendipity"), and lots of suspense that never lets up for a minute, "The Sum of All Fears" is 2-hour excitement at its best! A great DVD must-own to the first three films!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Finally Safe to Take a Shower Again"></head><body><p>The American Film Institute recently listed the top 100 suspense films of all time.  Topping the list was Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho".  This shouldn't be surprizing for those who saw the movie back in the 1960's.  It was a shocking movie that had a lot of people whispering about what they experienced in watching it.  I was considered too young to see it back then (before films ratings) and so, in latter half of the decade, I was looking forward to watching it on TV.  Alas, the previously announced television premier of the movie was cancelled.  My mother said that there had been a murder of the daughter of a prominent politician recently and this caused it to be pulled as a matter of proper respect.  Whatever the reason, I cite the event as a comparison of movie content then and now.  What you see in "Psycho" is far less graphic than the standard horror film of today yet its' impact is greater that just about anything that came before or since.<br /><br />The reason for this is that the film was put together by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  Rather than list the numerous examples of his talent on display, just consider the signature scene of the movie; the murder in the shower.  Here we have a prominent starlet of the era, Janet Leigh, being filmed while taking a shower.  That would probably raise a few eyebrows (or eyelids) even today.  However, we all sensed that something bad was going to happen.  The cuts to the house in the background and the partially audible voices arguing over the girl gave us a clue.  Even though we were on the edges of our seats, the attack still came as a shock.  I don't want to describe it too much although most of us have already seen that scene numerous times.  The series of camera shots alternating in a strobe-like effect kept us mesmerized.  The grating, alarming music that accompanied the sudden entrance of the assailant followed by the slow but steady ping of the shower curtains being pulled down, the glass-eyed stare of a dying woman, the blood mixing in with the shower water circling around as it goes down the drain symbolizing life itself draining away...  This was a whole heck of a lot in one rather brief moment on film.  We had a sense that we had seen everything yet the skill of the director and cameraman made sure that we didn't see too much.  This was one of the great scenes in cinematic history.<br /><br />It isn't just about that one scene either, this is a very compelling psychological horror movie.  The plot draws us in and once the suspense begins, it stays for quite a while.  The ending is fascinating too.  Simon Oakland's summation of what we had all just witnessed was a pretty good scene in itself.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie then make sure you don't miss it.  The standards of Television today being what they are, you won't miss any of the scenes or dialogue no matter what channel you watch it on.  But don't let that fool you, this is still a very scary movie.</p></body></html>

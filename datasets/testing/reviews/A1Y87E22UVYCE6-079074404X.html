<meta name="summary" content="Beware of the Id Monster!"></head><body><p>This is a remarkable movie in many ways. It is a veritable Sci-fi Classic of the `50s, over par of class-B and very innovative with tremendous special effects.<br /><br />I've seen it when I was just in my early teens and now when I saw it again still remembered some features as the footprint of the invisible monster and the lovely Altaira and her short skirted dresses.<br /><br />This is the plot: a starship from the Earth comes to rescue a long lost scientific expedition. They are received by Dr. Morbius, the only survivor and Altaira his daughter, born on the planet, being her mother a deceased fellow investigator of Dr. Morbius. He states he doesn't need to be rescued and interrupt his fascinating investigation of a lost planetary civilization: the Krells.<br /><br />Due to this civilization, Commander Adams declares he needs to consult Earth authorities as to what to do. That means he must stay at least two weeks and partially dissemble his ship in order to build a huge transmitter. Dr. Morbius offer the aid of Robby his multitask robot, (a remarkable creation of the film makers that fascinated the audience of the times). While Adams and his crew are performing this task they are attacked by an invisible monster that destroys essential equipment.<br />Adams order an electrical perimeter to be erected around the ship and next night they are attacked by the alien monster rendered half visible by the fence. The monster retires after killing some crew members. From here on the film reaches its climax.<br /><br />There are no big stars in the cast; nevertheless playacting is correct and convincing. Anne Francis composes a lovely na?ve girl, Leslie Nielsen correctly fleshes Commander Adams and veteran Walter Pigeon is Dr. Moribius.<br /><br />The outstanding items of the movie are the special effects, really over par for 1956 and the story, intelligent and thought provoking.<br /><br />This is a film that will be enjoyed by classic sci-fi fans and general public too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

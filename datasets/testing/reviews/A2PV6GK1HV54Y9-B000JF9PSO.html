<meta name="summary" content="The best film of 2006 for me!"></head><body><p>United 93 is an emotionally, realistic, honest work from writer/director Paul Greengrass. I heard the only actors were the people abroad the plane but the air traffic controllers, flight attendants, and pilots were played by real people. This movie is amazing and so harrowing, I highly recommend this film because United 93 is so much more moving than Oliver Stone's stiff and uninspiring, World Trade Center. Greengrass truly wrote a wonderful and moving story and it breaks my heart to think of the real life passengers abroad that plane on that fateful day. United 93 never seems wishy washy, flimsy or contrived in any way. This film is told with class and that's the best word to describe this gut-wrenching film. Please do not wait to buy this movie, it will touch you profoundly. And by the way, this movie should've been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, I am glad Greengrass was nominated for director but this movie deserved so much recognition and honor than what it actually got, how sad!</p></body></html>

All they've done is scotch tape an extremely poor hard drive quality transferred opening and ending sequence onto the film itself. There is NO seamless branching. Not only that, but director Liman's commentary has been ELIMINATED.<br /><br />To be sure, this is a quality film, but understand this release for what it is: an enticement to rile up attention for the sequel - nothing more.</p></body></html>

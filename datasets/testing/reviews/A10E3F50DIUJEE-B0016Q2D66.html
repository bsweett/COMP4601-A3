This film is an excellent showcase for her talent: the subtle body language and facial expressions, as well as the dynamic and explosive emotions and dialogue show her true gifts as an actress.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is stunning as well, but frankly he pales in comparison to Winslet.  Michael Shannon is also stunning in this film.  It is, overall, an excellent film that dissects several summer months in the lives of April and Frank Wheeler.  As they come to grasp the "emptiness and hopelessness" of their unfulfilling suburban lives, they both begin falling apart in their own ways.  It is obvious how unhappy they are ... but it is not until Frank's birthday that they attempt to do anything about it.  April comes up a grand scheme to move to Paris, so they can finally live.  Along the way, they face much resistance and soul searching as life continually throws them obstacles.<br /><br />I would categorize the film as somber. I truly enjoyed it, but was left rather sad in the end.  Still, do not let that discourage you from seeing this truly brilliant film.  Highly recommended</p></body></html>

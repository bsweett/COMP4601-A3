Ennis and Jack's story proves that you don't need to be married to the person you love, and you don't even have to see them everyday to still be in love with them. Their story elevates love to a whole new level, and the sexual aspect of it becomes secondary.<br /><br />This is the sort of pure and divine love story that I wish Schools would show their kids to teach them about real life. The world would be a much better place if kids watched things like this growing up - they would certainly be more grounded individuals and more true to their hearts. Its about time we all woke up and recognized this film for the pure slice of heaven it is.</p></body></html>

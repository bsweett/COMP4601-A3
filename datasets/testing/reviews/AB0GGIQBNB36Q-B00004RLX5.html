The reason is, To save the whales. Really?!, Really?!, this is the only even numbered star trek Movie that isn't good. It opens up with an alien probe traveling through space, cutting the power of every ship and space station it passes. When it stops by earth, obviously it causes trouble. bringing storms, all the while giving off a sound, that no one can interpret. But, on Vulcan, Kirk and his merry band have decided to turn themselves in to the federation. Oh, i didn't mention the trial at the begining, where the Klingons want the federation to hold Kirk accountable for the death of the Klingons in the previous movie, despite the fact that those Klingons were violating there own rules. But I digress, on the way home, with Spock on board. They pick up the signal from earth, warning all ships to stay away. And they hear the probe, and Ding ding ding, spock figures out with a computer that it's a whale song, and now the movie reaches it's message, that because in the 80's we killed off all the whales. It becomes a saving the whales and the planet message, so much that cathrine hick's character while giving a tour, goes off on a tagent about whaling, and what whalers have done. And how bad those companies are, I understand what this movie was trying to do, but the execution of that story was bad. For example, after they rescue the whales from the villains of the story, the whalers. They go back to their time, crash the ship in the ocean set the whales loose. And they are able to communicate with the probe, and voila the probe is satisfied, and leaves. just like that, now at the end Kirk is reduced to captain. I do own this movie, and I have tried to like this movie. But, it badly misses the mark. Again, I know what they wanted to do. Buuuut, the execution left alot to be desired.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Film That Lacks Some Important Information"></head><body><p>Able to leap thirty feet into the air in a single bound! Faster than The Matrix! Stronger than the California Governor! Look, it's a rocket! It's a super-fast computer program! No, it's Riddick! <p>Science Fiction afficionados will undoubtedly have fun examining THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK for its hidden layers and (hopefully) for what the next installment in the chronicles might hold. <p>This film is loosely based on the director's-David Twohy-2000 sleeper hit, PITCH BLACK, which introduced us to the butt-kicking, muscle-bound, dark hero Riddick, a conflicted man with a suspicious past and a "shine" in his eye that allows him to see in the dark.<p>In this new Summer release we get to see more of Riddick and learn about his sketchy past. Apparently he's a Furian (a thought-to-be extinct group of humans with...well...I'm not sure what. But he sure can move fast, fight fast and kill fast. Oh! Maybe THAT'S what a Furian is!). And he's been prompted to join in a fight against a group of world conquerors known as The Necromongers (think Gladiators with high tech armor that looks like something from the film Stargate). <p>When Riddick is `summoned' to the planet Helion Prime he discovers that the planet is under imminent threat of attack by The Necromongers and, before he can leave, the planet is indeed attacked. Riddick is captured (thanks to a beautiful Necromonger played by Thandie Newton) and brought in front of The Lord Marshall of the Necromongers (played by a pretty sinister Colm Feore) for a kind of reverse mind melding where, to the horror of The Lord Marshall, it is discovered that Riddick is the last of the Furians. Since The Lord Marshall was foretold that he would be killed by a Furian, he orders the immediate death of Riddick. But before this can happen, our reluctant hero makes an amazing escape and flees to (or rather is captured by mercenaries and taken to) the planet Crematoria, a small planetary body where it's 700 degrees in direct sunlight and minus-300 degrees in the dark. Here we encounter Jack, the boy who was a girl in PITCH BLACK, all grown up and trying to be a carbon copy of Riddick. <p>Meanwhile, back on Helion Prime, an Air Elemental creature that wisps from here to there like a gaseous anomaly (I've always wanted to say that!), played surprisingly well by Dame Judi Dench, is captured by The Necromongers and is being used by The Lord Marshall to discover if Riddick really IS a Furian and where he might be and if he's still alive. <p>A blurring set of battles and eye-popping CGI pulls the story along as Riddick and a group of runaway prisoners escape from Crematoria and head back to Helion Prime in an attempt to rescue Jack (who was captured during the battle), the ONE person that Riddick cares most about. <p>Does this sound like a lot of information? It is and, in truth, I haven't even scratched the surface of this film's layers. There are new religions introduced, strange technologies, traitorous activities, and the beginnings of the next film, all encapsulated in this oddly stilted movie. <p>Complaints: My concerns would have to be directed toward the lack of information about certain aspects in plot. For example: What exactly ARE the Furians? Where did they come from? And the "Elementals?" Are there Fire Elementals and Earth Elementals as well as Air Elementals? What type of religion is it that The Necromongers practice? We never see any ceremonies or religious symbolism. The Necromongers strive to find their place in something called `The Underverse', but we are never told what or where this place is and exactly WHY The Necromongers are so steadfast in getting there.<p>Usually, when you start a series or `chronicles', you set up the aforementioned items, giving some backstory while drawing the viewer in. Maybe Mr. Twohy will do this in his next installment, but to me this seems kind of backward.  <p>Maybe it's just me, though.<p>B-minus rating</p></body></html>

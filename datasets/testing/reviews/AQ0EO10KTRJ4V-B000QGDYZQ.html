<meta name="summary" content="Read the reviews and be warned"></head><body><p>It takes alot of creative energy and work to write songs, record albums and make movies..... so one sometimes feels bad when they are compelled to warn others away from something that is REALLY bad.<br /><br />But seriously... read the other reviews on here and be warned.<br />Their criticisms are valid for this film.<br /><br />I suppose since the classic "6th Sense", everybody is trying hard to make films along the same idea (ie.. the ultimate ironic twist), but whereas "6th Sense" was unique for NOT being deceptive and actually telling you the punchline all thru the movie and STILL surprising you.......... films like PREMONITION (and many others these past few years) try to deceive the audience with false information that is simply thrown in to fool the viewer (and offers no meaning or content the the film).<br /><br />PREMONITION is based on a good concept but only has enough substance to fill a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode.<br />As a result it really gets longwinded, repetitive and downright boring by the time 2 hours and 12 minutes (and the ending) come along.<br /><br />The ending is no surprise, however the behaviour and stupidity of the characters at the end is so bad you are either annoyed -or- don't care what happens to them.<br /><br />Summary:<br />A good premise for a 30 minute Twilight Zone TV episode stretched too thin for a 2+ hour long movie... stretched so thin in fact it breaks apart into pieces the viewer probably cares little about.</p></body></html>

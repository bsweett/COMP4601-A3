In ten years JURASSIC PARK has become a contemporary classic and spawned two sequels.  It's definitely among Spielberg's most fun films ever made and one of my favorites.<p>JURASSIC PARK, adapted from Michael Crichton's runaway best-seller, is the tale of a group of everyday people (including a chaos specialist and two paleontologists) who journey to a Costa Rican island to see the brainchild of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) - an amusement park that stretches across the entire island and is of yet top secret.  Disney World copy?  Not so, because this amusement park is home to walking, roaring, breathing and hungry dinosaurs.  Emphasis on hungry.<p>The animatronics are perfect, along with Spielberg's always great directing.  Michael Crichton and David Koepp write the suspenseful screenplay from Chrichton's novel; the cast is also very good (especially Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum, who would both return in the sequels), not to mention John Williams' always terrific score.  Williams' score really stands out in this one.<p>JURASSIC PARK is definitely a magnificent film and will continue to entertain us for generations to come.  In fact, it's one of the most entertaining films in years.  But don't listen to me jabber about it.  Go see this wonderous thriller for yourself.<p>OVERALL: 4 [Nearly a Masterpiece] out of 5 [Perfect]</p></body></html>

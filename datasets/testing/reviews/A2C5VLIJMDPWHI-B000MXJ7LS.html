<meta name="summary" content="The cast and extras didn't seem to represent NY"></head><body><p>Cons: I've never been to New York, but from what I hear about it, the city is very diverse. However, from the look of the film, you would think majority of the city was all white and Latino. I didn't see any black firefighters, police officers, doctors, etc. I know there was a little controversy about a statue being built in NY that didn't show one black law enforcement person in it. I also didn't understand why there was this long trail of people pulling out two people from the rubble. Everybody seemed to want to put their hands on the people who'd been removed, but isn't that kind of dangerous if somebody was to drop him? The long trail of people just seemed unlikely to me, or maybe it really was like that.<br /><br />Pros: I thought ALL of the actors did a great job of capturing the moment. I couldn't figure out why they were treating the one Latino guy like he was the helper instead of one of the officers. Did he had bad asthma or something? I might've missed that. He was the guy who they wanted to stay with the equipment. I enjoyed watching the interpretation of what happened that day. The stats at the end of the movie were eye opening. I didn't know that only 20 escaped, but I did know thousands came up missing. I definitely enjoyed the film. It's just the cons that sat with me while watching it.</p></body></html>

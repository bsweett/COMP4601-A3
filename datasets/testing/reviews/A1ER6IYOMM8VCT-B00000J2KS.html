<meta name="summary" content="MAKING THE INHUMAN HUMAN!"></head><body><p>This is a one of a kind film that is not going to be liked by everyone. It is one of the most disturbing films ever made and it hasn't mellowed with age. The violence in the film is deliberate and nessicary, Kubrick's vision is way ahead of it's time, but some of the sets seem a bit dated to me now. This film still packs a wallop and it is a truly unsettling film.</p></body></html>

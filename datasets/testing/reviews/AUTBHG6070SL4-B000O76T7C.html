There have been lots of horror movies before and since, space movies, and movies based on evil beings with varyin amounts of blood-lust. There have been combinations of those two or three. When it came out, Alien combined all three in the best mix to that point, and maybe since.<br /><br />Pacing is part of what makes this work so well. It gets off to a slow start, making clear just how tedious life can be in those months between solar systems. The pace picks up over the course of the movie, and tension just keeps building. Somehow, just when you thought Ripley was safe, the Alien appears again. This happens over and over, and Scott's direction makes it a new shock each time. The last scenes, with Ripley in her underwear, just reinforced the vulnerable mood. (Somehow, and I like this, Weaver looked good wearing not a lot, but the scene completely lacked in sexual overtones.)<br /><br />Just about everything in this movie works. H. R. Giger's Alien is unforgettable. Sigourney Weaver's "Ripley" is one one my all-time favorite characters. In fact, I like Ripley even better because of the great job Weaver did in Galaxy Quest. There, she played another character almost identical, except all the ways she was Ripley's opposite. The later part of the Alien movie is a blatant assualt on the senses - aggressive, but it helps keep the audience on edge, and was very effective in the big-screen environment.<br /><br />It was also interesting to see how much Scott carried forward from this movie, especially into Blade Runner. Alien has an earlier and cleaner form of the Tech Noir environment, man-made but somehow lacking in places for humans to fit in. Blade Runner toned down the flashing distractions, but made them into a kind of background that never allowed a truly quiet moment.<br /><br />This movie works in a lot of ways: by itself, in its genre, and in the careers of Scott and Weaver. Even though effects technology has changed in the last 25 years, this movie still carries itself well.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

The success of the film is due to the remarkable performance of Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers.  Her character is always on the edge, first to win the role of the Swan Queen, then to translate her cool perfection into the more passionate role of the Black Swan.  Her character is unsettled and going through a nervous breakdown as she tries to be the perfect dancer and cope with her own feelings of failure and that, once she s a success, that her life will go downhill until she is discarded.<br /><br />It is interesting to compare Black Swan to the ballet Swan Lake. The original libretto of Swan Lake ballet had Prince Siegfried and Odette (the Swan Queen) die together, thus releasing the handmaidens from the sorcerer's curse.  However, the ending was considered too sad so the ballet was changed to allow the prince and Odette live and break the spell.  The film goes back to the more tragic ending.  The threatening bird-like dancer who appears at the beginning of the film is the sorcerer responsible for the curse in the ballet.  So Nina is cursed herself into striving for perfection that is her own undoing<br /><br />The film plays off Nina's fears that someone will take her place in the role of the Black Swan; her represses sexual nature and fears that she will be discarded like the former prima ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder).  Adding to Nina's insecurity is Lily who appears to want to thwart Nina to claim the role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan while professing to admire her.  Nina's mother (played by Barbara Hershey) is pushing her daughter into the spotlight from her own failure to become a ballet star.<br /><br />Natalie Portman's performance is remarkable for the range of emotions she displays. She is on screen for almost all of the film, and it is her performance that makes the film. The supporting cast is also excellent: Barbara Hershey is obsessive in subtitle ways about her daughter's success down to a ballerina music box that plays music from Swan Lake. Mila Kunis was convincing as her rival, down the wings tattooed on her back and Winona Ryder turns in a solid performance as the spurred Beth.<br /><br />The film is beautifully photographed and the ballet scenes are nicely choreographed.  Potential viewers should be aware that the film is very intense at times as we are drawn into Nina's hallucinations.  Black Swan is also among the most creative films in recent memory and is certainly a film that cannot be forgotten.</p></body></html>

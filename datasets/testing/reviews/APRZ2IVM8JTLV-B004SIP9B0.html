<meta name="summary" content="God save THE QUEEN"></head><body><p>THE QUEEN(2006)<br /><br />  A superb historical film about how Queen Elizabeth ll and newly elected Prime Minister of Great Britain Tony Blair cope with the hysteria during the death and funeral of Princess Diana. A textbook example of how the historical film should be done. Fair and balanced. Accurate. No Political Agenda to muck up the proceedings. A controled informed script with excellent telling dialogue acted by a perfect inspired cast. Enlightning, entertaining and educational. The sort of thing that films were made for and the ideal that all should aspire. Very likely the best film of 2006 and most certainly the best historical film of the year.</p></body></html>

It might be asking to much to hope that most people will judge it based on its content, and not on whether or not they agree with the ratings I've chosen.  It's probably safe to assume that a large number of readers will already know what they think of these films, in which case I'd suggest you read this review to get another's opinion.  If you haven't seen either of these films, however, I guarantee you that you'll have a good idea of which of these movies you'll be most likely to enjoy.<br /><br />This review will concern two movies -- THE WOODSMAN and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GI3KGC">Hard Candy</a> -- both of which focus exclusively on the very thorny, very divisive topic of child molestation/pedophilia.<br /><br />Before I get into the films themselves, I'd like to make one thing crystal clear: there is nothing funny about child molestation.  It is a horrible crime, and there are no scenarios in which it is acceptable in any way, shape, or form.  As a survivor of child molestation, I have a first-hand understanding of the kinds of repercussions caused by this incredibly heinous act.  And please don't misunderstand.  I do NOT say this to garner pity or sympathy, nor do I seek to represent myself as the voice of all molestation victims everywhere.  Hardly.  It has taken me a long time to get to the point where I can say this with simple acknowledgement, as a way of framing my opinions with a basic and necessary fact that has colored my experiences with love, sex, romance, and relationships my entire life.<br /><br />My opinion, in a nutshell:  THE WOODSMAN is a good film, because it manages to get the audience to sympathize with the pedophile.  HARD CANDY is a horrible film for the exact same reason.  How can this be?  It's because the first film is about forgiveness and redemption, and the second film is about unadulterated hate and vengeance.  Speaking as someone who use to embrace hate, I can tell you that HARD CANDY's philosophies -- popular and easily digestible though they may be -- are counterproductive and destructive.  Older and wiser now, THE WOODSMAN's philosophies may be much harder to stomach, but they are the way the world is, or rather, should be.<br /><br />HARD CANDY is a disgusting film.  The talented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YABYLA">Ellen Page</a> plays Hayley Stark, a girl who is being pursued by Jeff, our resident pedophile.  After Jeff conives to get Hayley back to his house, it becomes clear that Hayley is not your typical 14-year-old.  From this point on, Hayley tortures Jeff relentlessly while they engage in repetitive and predictable dialogue about his crimes.  Hayley appears to have the wits of a Harvard grad and the strength and agility of a quarterback, because she ensares and releases and ensares Jeff in a series of elaborate torments without breaking a sweat.  This movie is very, very much a revenge fantasy, and that is all it is.<br /><br />When I was young, and lying in bed, I used to imagine similar fantasies, and all they did was prolong my own recovery process.  I've heard dozens of different explanations for the film's premise and goals, but the end game is this: this movie is obviously about turning the tables.  Unfortunately, when you turn the tables, what you get is a young girl who behaves with the confident viciousness of a child molester, and a child molester who flails about, as confused, hurt, and distraught as a child.  Jeff is a horrible person, which is why I was so disturbed to find myself kind of wishing he would win out over the insufferably pompous and stone-hearted Hayley.  This movie contains no subtlety, no surprises, and nothing beyond its surface level viciousness.<br /><br />THE WOODSMAN, on the other hand, shows the consequences of such viciousness.  Kevin Bacon plays Walter, a convicted child molester who is desperately trying to be a normal person.  Unlike HARD CANDY's endless rants, this film has very little dialogue, but world's more heart and wisdom.  Walter is a damaged man, but he knows he's damaged, and the movie explores the possibility that people can change, can finally deserve forgiveness.  There are a few very difficult scenes in THE WOODSMAN -- scenes I found myself gritting my teeth at -- but they provided very clear answers.  How can anyone change if they cannot forgive themselves?  And how can anyone forgive themselves if the world refuses to forgive them, too?<br /><br />As someone who struggled with forgiveness, trust me, I understand the desire to label such people with easy monikers like "monster" or "sicko," but I also know that those kinds of labels are just another way of avoiding the agonizing calculus of penance divided by resentment.  Actually, one of the labels I used -- sicko -- is fairly apt, because this film shows how Walter is less a villain who uses his urges to destroy than he is another human being who is destroyed by something he longs to be rid of.  In spite of the film's probative pace, it's quiet stance, the movie feels remarkably short (when it was done, it felt like thirty minutes had passed, instead of ninety), and although I felt like it could have gone into a bit more depth with some of its questions, it did do exactly what it set out to do, no more and no less.<br /><br />I give HARD CANDY one star, THE WOODSMAN four.  If you're wondering which one you might enjoy, ask yourself the following question: which philosophy do you most agree with...<br /><br />"An eye for an eye..." (HARD CANDY)<br />"...makes the whole world blind."  (THE WOODSMAN)</p></body></html>

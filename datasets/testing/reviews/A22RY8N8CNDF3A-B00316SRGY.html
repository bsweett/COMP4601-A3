<meta name="summary" content="Great Acting!"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood stars and directs this film  He is a graying, craggy, cranky Korean War Vet.  He lives in a tough neighborhood all alone (widower, agnostic, angry) and loath to become neighborly to a teenage boy next door, and his Hmong immigrant family.<br /><br />The movie is set in Detroit.  The economics of the times are clear and Clint plays Walt Kowalski as a racist that knows all the slurs in the book.  He is wrathful, prideful, and refuses to leave a neighborhood he is familiar with.  He sees the neighborhood deteriorating, but perseveres in holding his place.  He was well-trained in war and alert and ready for the neighborhood gangs as attempts are made to steal his prized possession, a Pontiac Gran Torino.<br /><br />This is a racial morality story, but also about personal bonds that form as we learn to live together in a changing world. There is bitter humor and deep caring as the characters learn to know each other and forget stereotypes.<br /><br />In the end, Walt gives wisdom and strength to a struggling immigrant family, as well as his most powerful performance.<br /><br />A film you will not forget.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pleasant while you are seeing it, but eminently forgettable"></head><body><p>I enjoy writing reviews for Amazon, which I do in part to make sure I take some time each day to string together a few moderately conservative sentences.  To facilitate my reviewing, I keep a list of books that I have read or movies I have seen or albums I have listened to that I would like at some point to write a review about.  I saw IN GOOD COMPANY about three weeks prior to writing this review, but I have to confess that from about five minutes after having finished watching it to this very moment, I haven't given it a second's thought.  And therein is the problem with the film:  while it is moderately entertaining while you are watching it, it will be entirely forgotten as soon as you are done.<br /><br />The plot is simple:  a marketing exec in his early fifties is demoted and given a boss half his age when a large corporation takes over his magazine.  The young boss has a brief but not a lasting affair with his daughter, who is an undergraduate at NYU.  Many of the former employees are fired as corporate down-sizing takes hold.  Eventually, the company sells the magazine and the young boss gets released and the middle-aged exec gets his job back.  To be honest, in spite all this, nothing much really happens in the film.  It is all just OK.  The script is just OK, the plot is just OK, the production is just OK.  As a result, there just isn't a whole lot to remember.  In other words, it is a solid and completely unspectacular Hollywood product.<br /><br />The cast was good, but given a much better cast wouldn't have faired much better since there was so little to work with.  Dennis Quaid was good as usual, and Scarlett Johansson, she of the beautiful eyes and mouth, was interesting to look at.  Topher Grace could have been vastly improved upon, and I'm not quite sure why he was cast in the role of the young hot shot executive.  Sometimes casting is just a mystery.<br /><br />All in all, there are worse uses of time than seeing this film, and many better uses.  I wouldn't advise anyone running away from it if it is on TV or if a friend has rented it, but I certainly wouldn't counsel anyone going out of their way to see it.</p></body></html>

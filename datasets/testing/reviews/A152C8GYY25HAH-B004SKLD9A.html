<meta name="summary" content="Style over substance mars this particular sci-fi film"></head><body><p>The distributor for &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533;, a modestly budgeted sci-fi thriller, had so little faith in it that it placed the film in just a few theaters in December, then let it die. One reason may be the title itself. In restaurants, some people are afraid to order a dish they can&#65533;t pronounce. These same people tend to avoid movies whose titles they can&#65533;t spell, pronounce and/or understand. Beyond that, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Two other recent thrillers &#65533; &#65533;AI: Artificial Intelligence&#65533; and &#65533;Minority Report&#65533; &#65533; had already painted much richer and more elaborate portraits of life in the future. Finally, unlike other small sci-fi flicks like &#65533;Gattaca&#65533;, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; unwisely uses too much energy on special effects and not enough on the story, which might have been interesting if it hadn&#65533;t been overwhelmed. <p>In this vision of the future, a third world war has resulted in a totalitarian society where all material things which cause people to feel emotion have been banned. People are also medicated daily to prevent them from feeling the anger and frustration which the government claims leads to war. Anyone who resists is dealt with immediately and harshly. Large SWAT teams swoop down on groups of resistors every day. In other words, this is a society that is continuously at war with war. <p>This plot concept, which isn&#65533;t wholly original, could have proved fascinating, but it is clumsily handled and full of holes. The highlight is  Christian Bale&#65533;s carefully orchestrated performance as Cleric John Preston, a high ranking member of the group responsible for enforcing the regime&#65533;s draconian measures. Preston, at first a totally unemotional man, ultimately sees the absurdity of his job and becomes a member of the resistance. <p>While not a noteworthy film, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; should provide many sci-fi fans with an enjoyable evening. It certainly isn&#65533;t the worst movie of it type, but it could have been so much more.</p></body></html>

Not about the man himself, whose 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead I enjoyed, and whose adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 I thought was stunning, but because of the fact that this is Watchmen for crying out loud.  The most celebrated comic ever crafted was deemed unfilmable for so long, but finally here we are, and what is the verdict on Snyder's take of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' classic?  Mostly positive, but not without its flaws either.  From a visual standpoint, Snyder has nailed the environment of Watchmen, as well as the appearances of the characters that populate the film.  The biggest flaw of the film however lies in its conclusion.  Even though the end result of the comic remains unchanged, changing the cause to being blamed on Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) just doesn't sit right with me.  Maybe it's the fanboy in me, but with the appearance of Ozymandias' (Matthew Goode) genetically altered pet Bubastis, and with no mention of his work on genetics (which plays into his construction and development of the squid-like creature in the comic), doesn't this raise a few moments of confusion, especially for those who never read the comic?  Despite this, the rest of Watchmen has been translated greatly.  While there are some other questionable slight changes as the story develops, the film retains the paranoid and compelling tone of Moore's comic.  Not to mention the perfect casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl; all of whom are superb.  Also, for a 160-some minute running time, it doesn't feel like it's that long, as you can't help but be glued to the screen from the brilliant title sequence onward.  All in all, Zack Snyder's take on Watchmen isn't without its flaws, but it is a visually stunning comic adaptation that manages to defy nearly everything that was going against it.  It isn't perfect, but it still manages to be something special as well, which is quite an achievement in itself.</p></body></html>

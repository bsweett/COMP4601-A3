He's a great comedian, sure, but as a dramatic actor he's even better (Ali, Collateral, this movie). His impersonation of Ray Charles was so believable that, after a while into the movie, you're not sure if you're seeing the real guy on the screen any more.<br /><br />On top of Foxx's performance, the movie serves as a very good view of a brilliant man (a genius, indeed) who faced the challenges of heroin dependency (much like most succesful jazz, blues and soul musicians in the bulk of the twentieth century). But most important, it presents him as he was able to overcome that. The power of his upbringing by his single mom cannot be overlooked: that woman left an indelible mark on Ray Charles Robinson, which accompanied him and urged him up and forward until his end.<br /><br />It must be said this may not be a movie for all audiences. There is more than one scene that may be strong for some viewers. However, I cannot give "Ray" anything other than five stars. Well deserved Oscar for Jamie Foxx!</p></body></html>

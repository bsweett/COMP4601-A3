<meta name="summary" content="Tomb Raider - HD"></head><body><p>Video transfer quality is great. Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 soundtrack is very clean - I haven't listened to the DTS soundtrack, but it includes one. Special features are PLENTY, among which are both a trailer and a teaser trailer in HD.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie, I would say you get a great value for the money with the quality and all the features. If you've never seen this movie before, and you feel the same way as I do about some of the other movies I've reviewed here on Amazon, then you may feel the same way as I do about "Tomb Raider" as well.<br /><br />My first impression - having all the bells and whistles of a great surround system - leads me to conclude that it's plenty "Tomb" but not quite "Raider".<br /><br />The story is decent as far as "adventures" go, perhaps more on the unconvincing side, but the action seemed small to me: gunfire petite...explosions dainty...somewhat corny...Lara evades a gunman's barrage of bullets in the main lobby of her mansion like a schoolyard tetherball going around its pole, and I couldn't help but be reminded of writings I remember from the U.S.S. Alabama - "Lead Dammit, Lead!"<br /><br />"Tomb Raider" may be more of (but not necessarily) a "chick flic" adventure (pardon the reference) strongly cashing in on the "daddy's little girl" theme, which could easily alienate some. However, do not assume me biased about a female lead: I found "Aeon Flux" to be an outstanding film - it too has a female lead.<br /><br />It turns out I honestly just didn't like this movie. If you're a fan of the "Tomb Raider" videogame, or of Angelina Jolie, or of archeological adventures or of the aforementioned thematic structure, you might get a kick out of this film. If you're particular about your collection, you may want to be cautious about this one - but in its defense, it's all a matter of taste.<br /><br />I neither recommend nor condemn this film - I just didn't like it.</p></body></html>

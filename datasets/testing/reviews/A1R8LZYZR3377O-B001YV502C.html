I believe you have to have that knowledge and perspective when watching this. That being said , it doesnt excuse the laboring scenes that attempt artistic looks. The beginning has a somewhat convoluted feel that prevents the viewer from fully understanding the main charactor(and for that matter the supposed futuristic era). I think the surroundings to create the year 2027 were weak. Their seemed a concerted effort to not go overboard. As far as the pace, I'm not the average "Blockbuster" viewer, and it was slow. I personally love most films taking place in England or with a British slant but I can see how this film saturated the beginning with boredom.<br /><br />  The concept is great. No more human births  and saving a beyond rare newborn has great appeal. Too many unnecessary scenes though that Clive Owens charactor seemed to be walking through. A real stretch(and yawn). Towards the later middle of the film it takes off. This is not simply because of the action picking up, but because you could more clearly see a bigger storyline coming together. The filming is brilliant as the interaction of unique charactors brings realism. Pure excitement abounds as bullets fly through the twisted rubble and you root for the near impossible. Again, brilliant filming. So much dragging in the beginning forced a simple ending. The end is where the expanding needed to be, with depth. Im not a strict thrill seeker only, and love heart felt and intricate scenes, but the start to middle was a little too big for itself. The movie is saved by some of the most harrowing rescue and action scenes I've ever seen. The standard dvd picture is decent but not outstanding. I cant comment on the HD DVD yet. A word to the viewer, be prepared to settle in early on.</p></body></html>

Not so much, here. Yes, there are charming and funny Dr. Seussian - type moments. But they just add flavor to the complex characters that populate the film.<br /><br />I appreciated the positive spin on the value of the life of a baby even though it's unwanted. It is referred to as a baby the entire movie. A few characters, all married, dabble in affairs. As disappointed as that made me, I appreciated that most of the characters knew their choices were wrong and hurtful.<br /><br />On a personal note, to give you insight into where I'm coming from, my marriage weathered an affair and I've seen the damage and I've experienced the life-changing damage, so I appreciated that even though the characters chose to go there, the wrongness/pain is acknowledged.<br /><br />Jenna (Keri Russell) is gut-level honest except to her abusive husband. The conflict rips and tears at her. She carries a baby she does not want or love. Pie-making and a handful of equally complex friends save her life.<br /><br />Some scenes are so poignant and/or painful I will remember them for a long time. Others were light-hearted and laugh out loud funny. Together they make a film that reached into my chest and poked at my heart.<br /><br />If you are prone to moments of deep melancholy and expect that Waitress is a fun, simple film -- you might want pass.</p></body></html>

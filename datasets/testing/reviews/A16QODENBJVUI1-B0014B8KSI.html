<meta name="summary" content="A nice, pleasant, safe, slightly bland movie"></head><body><p>This is a good, entertaining movie.  It was also the last movie nominated for Best Picture that I saw and I have to say, I can't understand how it got a nomination.  I don't for an instance regret having seen it, but it wouldn't make a list of the 25 best movies that I had seen released in 2007.  It is solid Hollywood filmmaking, but apart from a couple of excellent performances, it is nothing especially remarkable.  Of course, if it hadn't gotten so many Oscar nominations, we'd all be free to talk about what a fun, nice movie this is.  But with all the nominations, it is forced to pretensions of excellence that it simply does not possess.<br /><br />The central story is about the efforts of a agribusiness to cover up the harm it knowingly did to individuals through some of its chemicals.  One might expect this to be a heavily political film as a result.  It is not.  The agribusiness is positioned as the bad guy, but not much more.  I won't delve deeply into the plot, since pretty much all the film has to offer is its story, along with some excellent performances.  And the best performances are very, very good indeed.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton steals nearly ever scene she is in.  I have found her career to be fascinating.  For the longest time, it appeared that she was almost refusing to have a successful commercial career.  I knew her work in her thirties from a string of independent and foreign films, the best known of which was probably ORLANDO, in which she played the title character.  The usual wisdom is that a actress in her forties is not going to find many good roles in Hollywood.  But the previously aloof and unavailable Swinton has found a host of wonderful role in her mid-forties and beyond.  She had a bevy of new roles lined up before winning the Oscar.  I see no reason why they will decrease now.  The important thing is that her success is based entirely on her amazing talent.  Hers has not been the usual path to stardom, but more power to her.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson has racked up a host of wonderful performances since achieving something like stardom in THE FULL MONTY and his Oscar nomination here is definitely deserved.  Playing an attorney driven insane by his defense of a client he realizes has knowingly poisoned the plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against them, Wilkinson's role drives much of the plot of the film.<br /><br />George Clooney is reliably solid in the film's title role, but I suspect his nomination had more to do with his being a widely liked and admired person than in the merits of his performance.  Mind you, he was quite good in the role, but if it had been any of a number of similarly gifted actors in the same role I do not think they would have received a nomination.  Still, it is a good addition to his acting resume.<br /><br />My recommendation is:  see this film, but don't expect a masterpiece.  It is a good, solid, entertaining film.  For my money it was the weakest and least deserving of the films nominated for the Oscar this year.</p></body></html>

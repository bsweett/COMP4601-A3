This movie is one of the best to have come out in 2009, with perfectly good reasons. It's not a standard sci-fi picture, but rather a satire on segregation and xenophobia. It's distinctive in that it's not set in a typical metropolitan city (such as New York City or Los Angeles), but actually set in Johannesburg, South Africa. It's a pretty deep sci-fi film, and it sure does deliver. In addition to the satire and the high octane action in the last half hour, I like how the film starts as a documentary in the first half and then an action-packed adventure in the second half. But I think the strongest element in District 9 is Wikus van de Merwe, the protagonist played by Sharlto Copley. When he's first introduced, you don't seem to care about him at first. But when his life is in danger, you start to care about him. And when his life is REALLY on the line near the end, you root for him all the way. That is what I like most about this movie: you really care about those who try to survive. And despite the main villain being pretty much a cardboard cutout, District 9 is still a thought-provoking sci-fi film that offers plenty of action, adventure, drama, and even humor. It's one of the definite best films of 2009.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

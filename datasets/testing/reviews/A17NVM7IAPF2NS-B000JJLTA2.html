<meta name="summary" content="League of Sean Connery and Some Extraordinary Unmentionables"></head><body><p>This film is an absolute mess.  The one redeeming quality is Sean Connery's acting and charisma, but there is NOTHING else here.<p>Sean Connery seems to have thrown his lot in with some extremely lack-luster talent here.  Granted, I can see why some women find Stuart Townsend pretty, but every role he's in seems to place a rather smug "Gosh, I know I'm beautiful" look on his face.  I mean, Dorian Gray...an IMMORTAL?  Please.<p>Mina-the occasional vampire lady-seems on the verge of evoking some sort of emotion, but just can't get past the costume.  One laughably memorable moment is where she looks frightened in the car as Dorian jumps off to supposedly attack some bad guys.  A few seconds later, she positively growls something to the effect of, "These men are mine!" whilst launching herself into attack.  Fear...anger...whatever.  It's in the script, right?<p>Jekyll/Hyde...I won't even go there.  And the Invisible Man was too smarmy for my taste.<p>Despite the lack of talent, there may have been some room for good story, character development, etc., but there's nothing there either.  The evil Phantom wants to take over the world, or some foolish nonsense of the sort, and there are plot twists and double-crosses that perhaps an 8-year old might be taken aback with a childish, "I didn't see that coming, Daddy!"  Funny, the rest of the adult audience could see a lot of this nonsense straight off the bat.<p>One prime example of where character development fails centers around the loss of Sean Connery's son in the film, but even the Phantom's taunting doesn't even get a rise out of him.  The American who is oh-so-obviously-a-detached-replacement-of-a-son hardly conjures any tears, sympathy, or any emotive response for that matter.<p>Effects.  Special effect-wise, you can see why this movie was made because this movie seems to be nothing but.  No CGI in the world can save a bad movie and this is one shining example.<p>Skip it.  I bought it out of curiosity, sadly, but I'm glad that I missed it in the theater.</p></body></html>

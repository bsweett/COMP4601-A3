<meta name="summary" content="A New Era Of Superman And A Loving Tribute As Well"></head><body><p>When I first saw the previews for "Superman Returns," I got really nostalgic for the "Superman" I remember seeing while I grew up, Christopher Reeve.  I even went out and bought first the Reeve flick just so I could refresh myself on that movie and introduce my daughter to Reeve's version of the hero.  I knew that director Bryan Singer and his crew would have a tough row to hoe considering how loved Reeve has been since donning the red cape and blue tights.  I was even hoping at one point to be let down by this new vision of one of the world's most famous superheroes.<br /><br />Instead, I saw a film that pays homage not only to Christopher Reeve's "Superman," but also to the old serial starring George Reeves that most of my generation and definitely these young kids today haven't seen or heard of.  Singer takes great care of forming newcomer Brandon Routh's version of Superman into a completely new being with a consistent nostalgic nod to those in the role before him.  Granted, some liberties are taken with the character, but they don't take away from the mythos of the original comic hero.<br /><br />The story goes like this:  Superman, after finding out that astronomers think they have located his home planet of Kryptonite, heads off to see it for himself.  He returns five years later and empty-handed, not finding what he is looking for.  Almost immediately, he begins doing what he always did:  fight for truth, justice, and the American way.  Some quibble over a line delivered in the film that refers to "truth, justice, and all that stuff" as being unpatriotic, but I felt that the line was rendered in a fashion that didn't take away from the "American way."  Besides, real fans of Superman know that he is definitely for the American way, no matter who tries to make him politically correct.  Anyway, while saving the planet as usual, Supe's old foe, Lex Luthor, is once again planning to take over the world, Lois Lane is engaged and has a young son, and Jimmy Olsen is still full of giddy, childlike innocence and ignorance.<br /><br />Routh was perfectly cast as the Man of Steel.  He has a look that harkens back to Christopher Reeve, but manages to make the character his own.  Kate Bosworth has received a lot of flack for being cast as Lois Lane, but she, much like everyone else in this flick, had some very big shoes to fill.  I miss Margot Kidder's raspy, sassy Lois, but Bosworth does a wonderful job no less.  I also longed to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, but Kevin Spacey is sinisterly devious in his execution of the role.  Much like in the older "Superman" flicks, Luthor delivers some of the funniest lines and relishes in his wickedness.  Sam Huntington is game as Jimmy Olsen, though his role is considerably smaller than everybody else's in this flick.  Frank Langella and James Marsden play father and son, Perry and Richard White.  Richard is engaged to Lois, and although Superman is a little miffed about this, he doesn't linger on it long once he realizes that Richard is a decent and caring man.  Parker Posey plays Kitty Kowalski.  She's no Valerie Perrine, but she has enough goofy charm to steal plenty of thunder from Spacey's Luthor during the film.  There will never be another Otis, performed originally by Ned Beatty, but Kal Penn (Harold and Kumar Go To Whitecastle) is the only recognizable member of a gaggle of thugs that Luthor keeps with him.  Few words are spoken amongst the group, but they have a very intense sequence in the film when they meet up with Superman.<br /><br />Singer was careful not to offend fans of the older versions of "Superman," maintaining the goofy charm of Clark Kent and the "big boy scout" quips by Superman such as nagging Lois about smoking.  He spent a lot of time allowing us to see Superman in flight, giving the audience a healthy dose of trips into outerspace, skimming the ocean with Lois, and catching falling victims in mid-air.  He also pumped up Supe's eye beams, putting them to frequent, and visually fun, use.  We get to check out the X-ray vision, outrunning speeding bullets, stopping speeding bullets, and even a cool flight through fire.<br /><br />Much like Sam Raimi with the "Spiderman" films, I feel that Bryan Singer was truly the best choice for taking command of a project like "Superman Returns."  He obviously loves the character, and respects the old TV shows, movies, and the comics.  This movie was much better than I ever expected and looks to be a very solid beginning to a new series of "Superman" flicks.  Hopefully Singer will be able to make more of these films and give them the treatment they deserve.  He managed to make a superhero flick with heart, and that's a hard thing to do these days considering the ease of CGI use.  Most directors, as did Brett Ratner with the latest "X-Men" installment, dump storyline for action sequences.  Singer serves up plenty of both in this latest entry into the comic movie world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great story, light humor, and plenty of action.  Also, for all of you Christopher Reeve fans out there who think you shouldn't tamper with perfection, just know that "Superman Returns" realizes where it came from and does justice to the past.</p></body></html>

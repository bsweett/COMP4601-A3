<meta name="summary" content="An Intimate and Stunning Look at the Emperor Penguin on Land."></head><body><p>"March of the Penguins" documents the lives of emperor penguins over the course of 9 months of Antarctic winter, as the birds take to land to find mates and raise chicks before returning to their comparatively leisurely life at sea for the summer.  French filmmaker Luc Jacquet created this tale of life on the "darkest, driest, windiest, and coldest continent on Earth" with film shot by cinematographers J&eacute;r?me Maison and Laurent Chalet, who spent a winter with the penguins. I've seen a lot of excellent still photography of penguins, but "March of the Penguins" is the most spectacular and intimate cinematography of these birds that I've ever seen. The film is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman. This narration replaces the original French narration of the film, in which the penguins told their own story, voiced by human actors, if you can believe it. Well, a lot of people didn't believe it, so a new, more objective, narration was written for some international markets. There is a little romanticizing and dramatizing in this commentary, but it's good-natured and easy to spot.<br /><br />Rotund sea birds waddling about on land can have comic consequences, and there are some laugh out loud moments in "March of the Penguins". But this film is generally dramatic, highlighting the great hardships that the penguins endure to reproduce under extraordinarily harsh conditions. The photography of Antarctica's landscape is spectacular in itself, and funny-looking birds waddling stoically across the bleak, icy terrain is quite a sight. Once the penguins traverse 70 miles to reach their breeding ground, where the ice is thick, we watch their quest for a suitable mate, egg-laying, and child-rearing, as starving parents must trek back to the sea to feed and return to feed their offspring and relieve their mates. The sight of the penguins huddled together in frigid temperatures and blizzard conditions as the Southern Lights dance across the perpetual night sky is downright eerie. Of course, there is lot of footage of irresistibly adorable baby penguins too, who play and bicker and suffer the harsh realities of Antarctic winter. "March of the Penguins" is a pleasure to watch. It's a wonder to see these remarkable birds up close.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): Bonus features include 2 documentaries, one cartoon, and a theatrical trailer (2 min). "Of Penguins and Men" (53 min) is a making-of documentary narrated, in English, by cinematographer J&eacute;r?me Maison. Maison follows both the story of the penguins and that of himself and fellow cinematographer Laurent Chalet, as they spend a sometimes perilous 9 months of winter filming the penguins. It includes some information about the penguins that was not in the feature film.  "National Geographic's Critter Cam: Emperor Penguins" (23 min) is a television show featuring the "critter cam", for which a camera is attached to a critter, in this case an emperor penguin in order to learn how it feeds underneath the pack ice. It follows 2 researchers who are studying the impact of climate change, specifically the enormous iceberg B15, on the lives of emperor penguins. "8 Ball Bunny" (7 min) is a Bugs Bunny cartoon that features a penguin. After a little lost penguin falls into his rabbit hole, Bugs promises to escort the little fellow home -before he realizes that penguins are from the South Pole. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

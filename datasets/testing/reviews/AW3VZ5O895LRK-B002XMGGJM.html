<meta name="summary" content="agree with reviewer ross--ending ruined it"></head><body><p>i would give this movie a four star rating but for the last ten minutes of the movie which ruined it for me.  it is so sappy, so sentimental and so ridiculous, that i can only imagine some studio hack came up with it at the eleventh hour.  or maybe they used a focus group. but i was having a good time up until then when a father takes revenge against those in the legal system who let a killer walk free. all the people he gets rid of were well worth it and i enjoyed that portion hugely, which fortunately is the bulk of the movie.</p></body></html>

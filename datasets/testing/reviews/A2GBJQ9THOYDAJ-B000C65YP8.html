Everyone wants them, everyone needs them. From selling a single Uzi to a local hood, he progresses to buying up abandoned U.S. small arms overseas, to shipping every kind of munitions you can think of to every part of the globe. Then it's 1992 and the Soviet Union collapses, and ex-Soviet army officers in all the various republics begin selling off the weapons systems under their control in order to replace their lost paychecks -- several billions of dollars worth from the newly-independent Ukraine alone. Most of his buyers are African, especially the bloodthirsty dictator of Liberia and his cannibalistic son -- and the Orlov character, who's well aware of what his trade facilitates, has a number of perceptive and pungent things to say about the West's attitudes toward the multiple African genocides of the `90s. (There are a number of shocking scenes and camera shots that are definitely *not* for kids.) Meanwhile, Yuri has acquired a wife, a high-priced model, to whom he lies continually regarding his business, until the straight-arrow ATF agent (or maybe he's Interpol; it's not clear) who has been pursuing her husband for years clues her in. Finally, Yuri's extremely troubled younger brother is killed during a deal in Sierra Leone and it's an overlooked bullet in his body, shipped back to the States, that leads to Yuri's arrest. The climactic scene, in which Yuri explains to the agent exactly how and why no charges will ever be brought -- the government *needs* men like him, though they'll never admit it -- is like a bullet between the eyes. The world's largest arms dealer, in fact, lives in the White House, selling as many weapons in a day as Yuri does in a month. And the largest arms brokers in the world are the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This is a deeply cynical film, but that doesn't make it wrong.</p></body></html>

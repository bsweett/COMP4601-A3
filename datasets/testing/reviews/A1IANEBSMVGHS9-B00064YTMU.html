<meta name="summary" content="Solid!"></head><body><p>With two of my all-time favorite movies directed by Mann ("Heat" and "The Insider"), and having Cruise as one of my favorite actors, I couldn't resist the temptation to check out "Collateral". And I wasn't dissapointed.<br /><br />As Mann has us used to, he has you on the edge of your seat all through the movie, with some fantastic dialog and some great directing and photography, something that has made him legendary by now, with his unique treatment of light and shadows. Interestingly enough, the script's credit this time falls in the lap of Stuart Beattie, one of the co-writers for "Pirates of the Caribbean", a 'first time' for Mann, who normally writes or adapts the script himself.<br /><br />As for Cruise and his interaction on the screen with Foxx, it's a perfect match. Cruise: what else can you say about him that has not been said? I guess, the fact that he plays a damn good bad guy! Interesting that he'd be a fourth choice for the role after Rusell Crowe was considered for it, and both, Edward Norton and Colin Farrell, were offered the chance to play Vincent. As for Foxx ("Ali", "Any Given Sunday"), he too does a fine job, consolidating him along with Will Smith as the top talent in a solid new generation of african americans following the lead of Denzel Washington.<br /><br />All in all, one solid blend of tasteful directing, great camerawork, engaging dialogs and acting, and tying it all together in the background, an eclectic soundtrack combining the musical talent of James Newton Howard.</p></body></html>

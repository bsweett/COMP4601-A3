The United States was just beginning to accelerate its Vietnam troop strength in 1964, and at age 16, living in suburban Boston, the title of the movie was quickly changed to "Dr. Strangeglove" in honor of Red Sox bumbler Dick Stuart. I distinctly remember Strangelove's performance as being hilarious, and still do, simply because he's totally, totally  unrealistic.It's the other characters, especially the base commander, the President, George C. Scott, et al who have become more realistic over the years, therefore more scary to me. Remember, in 2007, the United States flew nuclear weapons right down the center of the country, leaving them unattended on a Texas airbase,This morning's Presidential budget includes $70 billion in new defense spending; this despite various sundry plans to "wind down' overseas. For years, historical novelist Gore Vidal, now living in Italy, has been harping that money and sex are the true powers in Washington D.C. Care to debate him? In summary, Strangelove the character will always be a personal favorite. As for the movie, it becomes more prophetic, less comedic, more black, with every wiewing.</p></body></html>

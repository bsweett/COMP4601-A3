<meta name="summary" content="Great build up with a disappointing payoff"></head><body><p>For about an hour and 45 minutes, Inside Man had me on the edge of my seat, totally clueless as to what was going on and how the film was going to be resolved.  But then, when the ending finally happened, I found myself to be pretty disappointed.  Not disappointed in the film overall, but just at how Spike Lee decided to wrap it up.<br /><br />The plot is really simple:  Dalton Russell, played brilliantly (as always) by Clive Owen, has devised "the perfect bank robbery," which he is executing in a branch of the bank in the middle of New York City.  Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) is called on the scene as the head negotiator, and proceeds to delve into a cat-and-mouse game with Dalton.  The situation is further complicated when Jodie Foster, who plays an unexplained, extremely influential woman, comes onto the scene demanding to be given access to the robbers and to the bank itself.  Foster's character is the one part of the movie that just doesn't seem to fit.  We know why she is there, but her character is not developed at all.  We don't know why she does what she does, how she got to this point, or why she is so ridiculously confident about getting her way.<br /><br />Other than Foster's character, we pretty much know exactly the kind of person we are dealing with when it comes to Russell, Frazier, and the other important roles.  While the film does a great job of infusing the racial issue with the routine bank heist storyline, the film ultimately trips over its own feet.  A film with this much build up, and when the build up is this well done, needs to absolutely blow the viewer away with the ending, or the whole film seems to be for naught.  When the ending comes, I was left thinking, "is this really why the robbers went to all this trouble?"  There are some minor plot holes, but the film does explain itself, just not to the extent that I was expecting or hoping for.  This is the best Spike Lee film that I have ever seen, but that really isn't saying that much...<br /><br />Inside Man definitely gets my recommendation, but be forewarned that the film ultimately can't live up to its own cleverness.</p></body></html>

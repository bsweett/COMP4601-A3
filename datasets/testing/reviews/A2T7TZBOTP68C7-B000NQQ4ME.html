<meta name="summary" content="Overshadowed by Violence"></head><body><p>A true cinematic achievement in costumes, makeup, and the overall recreation of an ancient setting is overshadowed by the orgiastic violence.  I almost did not make it through the movie.  If you are delighted by films like Saw and Hostel, you will love Apocalypto.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a Lord Of the Flies type hunt of a terrified tapir through the jungle, five youths hot on its heels.  The animal's death is horrific and not immediate.  A subsequent raid on a happy village is traumatic, with an infant being ripped from it's mother's arms and dangled like a doll.  Later, a human sacrifice has his heart ripped out and held aloft, still beating.  They don't just show it once, but twice, all from the terrified victim's p.o.v.  None of the characters except the main one, Jaguar Paw, are saved from slaughter.<br /><br />The costumes, makeup, Mayan language script, and the authentic pyramid show how much work went into making the movie.  Nothing like this was ever done before.  Gibson wanted to set the viewer right into another time.  It does have that feeling, but the first three-quarters are truly more a horror film than an action movie.  If you can make it through, the last quarter is a great action movie and the viewer can finally cheer.</p></body></html>

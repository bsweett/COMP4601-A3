This movie is huge - an icon - and many since have imitated it's style.  For decades I don't know how many movies have been hyped as "The Chinese Godfather" or "The Modern Godfather".  They all fall short of the original.<br /><br />It's interesting to me that much second-guessing surrounded everything from the story to the casting of actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Those two are joined by Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire and I see I'm using up space giving you the all-star cast.<br /><br />The story, the direction, the lighting and the cinematography were all revolutionary.  It was controversial to make a movie in which the "heroes" were gangsters, but here Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo mesmerized us with the story of men who were at times ruthless killers, yet at the same time devoted to their families and devout to their church.  The backstory of how Vito Corleone became "The Godfather" from Puzo's original novel isn't told until the 2nd movie (with Robert DeNiro playing the young Vito), but we see that these Mafia men believe that they are in a country full of opportunity, but also full of corruption - they know that if they don't exploit the world someone else will - so this justfies their careers in their minds.<br /><br />The movie is a series of virtuoso sequences and performances.  Small nuances are performed with fluorishes - Brando affectionately petting the purring kitten in the opening sequence while men are lining up to come into his office to pay their respects or ask favors of him - because it's his daughter's wedding day he cannot refuse.<br /><br />The wedding introduces the broad cast of characters and we get time to see that Santino is the hot-headed lover, Fredo is the dim-witted brother and Michael is the returning war-hero who distances himself from the "family business".  Although there are literally hundreds of individual sub-plots, the main story of the entire Godfather Trilogy is Michael's, (after his father) and how he goes from youngest son, determined to stay out of the business, to a Godfather more ruthless than them all.<br /><br />After the wedding is another virtuoso scene that sets up most of the rest of the movie.  Al Lettieri as Sollozzo requests a meeting with the Corleone family.  He wants to establish a drug empire and he has already made arrangements for getting the opium and distributing it.  From the Corleones he needs "a little finance" and political protection for when his men are inevitably stopped by police.  Vito Corleone has made his fortune first hijacking delivery trucks, then in gambling and bootlegging, which he tells Sollozzo the police regard as "harmless vices".  He is disdainful of a rival Don who deals in prostitution. At one point he tells his son "Tattaglia is a pimp" with complete disgust.  He tells Sollozzo that he must refuse the offer because his political friends will no longer be his friends if he begins to deal in drugs.  Sollozzo replies that the Tattaglia family guarantee the investment, and that the riches are projected to come pouring in.  Hot-headed Sonny speaks out of turn and abruptly interjects "you mean the Tattaglia's GUARANTEE our investment".  His father has already decided for his entire organization, and Santino, the 2nd in charge, reveals his eagerness to Sollozzo for trying this drug plan.  No word is spoken after Vito shuts up his son with a gesture, but knowing looks are passed between everyone in the room.  There will be trouble because Sollozzo now knows that Sonny is hot for the deal.<br /><br />Sollozzo arranges to hit Don Corleone and his most trusted bodyguard, the fearful Luca Brasi.  What he doesn't plan on is that Sonny's loyalty to his family, and his famous rage, are going to take precedent over any desire to join Sollozzo in the drug business.<br /><br />I have only encapsulated the first act of one of America's greatest film epics.  Although they are gangsters, these characters stick with you.  For many of them, there is "honor among thieves", and at one point a long-time trusted Capo is led to betray the family and you really feel sorrow for him as he is led away and states remorsefully "Tell Mike it was only business."<br /><br />The business of this movie sucks you up into Mario Puzo's world and you hardly feel as if time has passed when the credits roll almost three hours later.  This is the King of the Gangster movies.</p></body></html>

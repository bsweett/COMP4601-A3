<meta name="summary" content="Frightful Fun....Fabulous DVD"></head><body><p>Hitch said it's "...an exquisite murder with a touch of the bizarre..."<br /><br />So...You may never want to take a shower(alone) again as "Mother" Bates  goes on a psychotic killing spree in "Psycho", the mother of all fright flicks! It stars Anthony Perkins(who "wouldn't hurt a fly"), Janet Leigh and Vera Miles.<br /><br />It's a film that has scared us silly for over 45 years now, and even though we already know what's coming, we still feel our hearts racing, everytime we hear that familiar music to murder by, and then jump when that shower curtain gets pulled back.<br /><br />You know it's one that you can watch over and over, so without further ado about the film(there are many great reviews here, speaking to the story and the wonderful performances), here's a look at the DVD.<br /><br />Universal has made a beautiful transfer of this classic and cherished work. The black and white images are crisp, sharp. The special features include a documnetary, introduced by Hitch, that runs the length of a feature film itself, and even has it's own chapter stops. It has everything you wanted to know about the making of and more! The sound, both dialouge and the wonderfully eerie music is good,in Dolby Dig 2.0 Mono (the score alone probably would be great in at least stereo, though). Languages are English (with captions if needed) and French, and there are subtitles in Spanish as well.<br /><br />Looking for Hitch?

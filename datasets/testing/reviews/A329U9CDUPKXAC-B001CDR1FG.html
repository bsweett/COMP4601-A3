I watched the cartoons, collected the toys and went as the Hulk for Halloween. So to see this super hero come to life is a dream come true. At least, it was until I saw it. The first half of the movie is incredibly boring. I actually felt like walking out. I REALLY did not like the display of animal cruelty. That was inexcusable. Another thing I hated was the way they used frames on the screen to make it look like a comic book. That was distracting and annoying. The acting in the movie was very bad. Nobody seemed shocked when they saw the Hulk. When Betty first sees him she's like "Oh, hi there!" And when Hulk is fighting the hulk doggies she's like "Oh, this is interesting..." Another thing, why is the army keeps shooting Hulk when they know it doesn't hurt him? Why don't they leave him alone until he calms down? Another thing, why did the local police get called on? Do they think their tiny guns can stop him? I really didn't care about Betty and her relationship with her father. I didn't care about Bruce and his relationship with his father. I didn't care about Bruce and Betty's fathers relationships with each other. I didn't care about the guy who wanted to make money off of the Hulk. I just really didn't like this movie. What a let down.</p></body></html>

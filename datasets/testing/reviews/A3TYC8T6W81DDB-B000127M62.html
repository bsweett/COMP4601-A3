So he formulates a plan to get people to remember and fear Freddy once again, but he isn't strong enough to do it alone. He resurrects Jason Voorhees by pretending to be Pamela Voorhees and tells Jason to go to Elm Street. Once there, Jason does the dirty work and Freddy Krueger's name starts to spread. The more fear that spreads, the stronger Freddy gets. Things seem to be progressing in Freddy's favor until Jason unintentionally steals a kill from Freddy and winds up setting the stage for a battle between two horror icons that fans have been anticipating for at least a decade.<br /><br />After so much buildup and fans waiting so long for this epic confrontation to take place, there really was no way it could live up to the hype. With that being said, it isn't a terrible film. Just disappointing. It really feels like more of a Nightmare On Elm Street film than a Friday the 13th film. So, right off the bat, that gets to me since I wasn't a big fan of the ANOES franchise and I'm completely biased towards Friday the 13th as a whole. Jason is also suddenly afraid of water and emotional, which hurts the character overall. While this may be the biggest Jason to date, he certainly comes off as the weakest. Freddy seems to be two steps ahead of Jason throughout most of the film, as well. While it makes sense overall, the F13 fan in me would've liked to have seen Jason have a bit more control offensively in the film. Overall, I think the most disappointing factor of this film is that a sequel never materialized even though the film did fairly strong numbers at the box office and on DVD. A few of the endings that were scrapped would have been amazing compared to the inconclusive one we wound up with. It's just a shame because a follow up is nothing more than a dream sequence at this point.<br /><br />Rating - 5/10</p></body></html>

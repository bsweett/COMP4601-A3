<meta name="summary" content="A New and Fascinating Milieu for a Traditional Action Movie."></head><body><p>"Apocalypto" presents a fresh variation on the staple action movie storyline of an Everyman who goes to extraordinary lengths to save his family from peril. Director and co-writer Mel Gibson has made a career of heroic men who emerge from mundane circumstances to combat threats to loved ones, first as an actor, now as a director. Having told this story in Medieval Scotland, apocalyptic Down Under, and present-day Los Angeles, Gibson places his classic hero on a new canvas: Mayan civilization circa 1500. For those who crave action, primitive weaponry and hand-to-hand combat prove as compelling as explosions and machine guns. As gruesome violence is also a Gibson tradition, there is plenty of that too.<br /><br />In the jungle of early 16th century Central America, tribespeople go about their daily business. Young men hunt and make jokes, elders dole out advice and stories, and families enjoy one another's company. The idyll is shattered one morning when a group of Holcane warriors raid the village, burn it to the ground, take prisoners, and kill almost indiscriminately. A young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) manages to conceal his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and son in a nearby pit before he is captured. He and his fellow captives are marched through jungle, river, and hills until they reach a city. The Mayans are a civilization in crisis, plagued by disease, crop failure, and famine.  Desperate to appease their gods, they have gruesome plans for the prisoners. But Jaguar Paw is determined to return to his forest and his family, who need his help to get out of the pit.<br /><br />The pregnant woman in peril and the relentless young husband are cliches. And it's hokey for a person named Jaguar Paw to be saved by a jaguar, which he happens to run into up a tree. But this is an environment we're not used to seeing, and "Apocalypto" effectively builds suspense in spite of its predictability. The only time it ran out of steam for me was during the jungle chase, which resembles "The Perils of Pauline" after a while. What most impressed me about "Apocalypto" is the meticulously recreated Mayan aesthetic. The piercings, tattoos, and scarifications can be off-putting, and that's before we arrive in the city, where the wealthy proudly display jade-inlaid teeth and huge headdresses. But it grew on me. After a while, I caught on to this concept of beauty, and it became glamorous and alluring.<br /><br />Much has been made of historical inaccuracies in this film, but I don't think its sins are so grievous. Elements from Mayan classic and post-classic periods are combined for aesthetic reasons, and fictions such as the human target game and, I assume, the tapir trap are added to enhance the action and showcase Mayan weaponry. That kind of thing will drive a historian nuts, but laypeople shrug it off. Although Jaguar Paw is imbued with modern, middle-class values, and the film's thematic framing device, "a great civilization in not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within", necessitates muddling of dates, this seems to me a good introduction to Mayan civilization -largely because we get to see what these people looked like, with the help of a recreated city and 700 extras. All dialogue in "Apocalypto" is Yucatec Maya, which is not the actors' native language. English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Touchstone 2007): There is a making-of documentary, one deleted scene (30 sec), and an audio commentary. "Becoming Mayan: Creating Apocalypto" (25 min) interviews Mel Gibson and co-writer Farhad Safinia about locations in Mexico and building the Mayan city. Other members of the creative team talk about recreating the Mayans through costumes and make-up. Weapons consultant Simon Atherton discusses Mayan weaponry. The audio commentary is by writer/director/ producer Mel Gibson and co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia. This casual commentary doesn't have as much historical information as I would have liked. But it does provide some Mayan background, as well as discussions of lighting, the intentions behind some scenes, and filming anecdotes. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, English, Spanish, and French.</p></body></html>

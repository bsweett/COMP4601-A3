<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie To Lose Yourself In"></head><body><p>I'm typically not a big Mark Wahlberg fan.  That whole Marky Mark thing still haunts me.  I saw this movie at the theater because there was nothing else showing.  I did so reluctantly at a friend's request.  I was pleasantly surpised by how good it actually was.  This movie just rocks along.  There was never a slow part that made me lose interest.  This is one of those rare times where Hollywood didn't drop the ball and deliver something purile and geared for the socially-retarded moviegoer.  Non-stop action with a clever plot and good actors.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg is Bob Lee Swagger, an ex-marine scout sniper that ended his military career after a botched mission in Africa left his partner and friend dead and him to fend for his life.  Holed up in the mountains for the past three years, Swagger is visited by a mush-mouthed colonel (Danny Glover) with a mission.  Seems like there is going to be an attempt on the President's life, and they want Swagger to figure out how they're going to do it.  Pure recon mission.  Right!  Well... Swagger gets set up after the attempt on the President goes down, killing an Ethiopian Bishop instead of the President.  On the run and wounded, Swagger has every law enforcement agency in the nation howling for his blood.<br /><br />This is great entertainment, pure and simple. Wahlberg is cool and calculating and detatched in the way that reminds me of the early Dirty Harry movies with Clint Eastwood.  He is brutal and it rocks! Michael Pena does great as the FBI agent roped into helping Swagger and Kate Mara is pretty and tough as Swagger's dead partner's widow who helps him when no one else will.  Ned Beatty plays the creepy Senator behind the whole dark mess.  Great action and smart script.  Training Day director Antoine Fuqua directs.  Excellent!<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

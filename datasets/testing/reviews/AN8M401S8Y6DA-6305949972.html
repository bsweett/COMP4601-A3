<meta name="summary" content="Blu Ray/ Coll ED Features Below (some info on the ultimate edition).  Seems Worth Double Dipping."></head><body><p>I was able to find the information online for this blu ray and figured I'd pass it along.  The original dvd contains Burton's short films such as Vincent and I was glad to see these are also on here along with a ton of new features, nothing appears to be left out.  If you have a blu ray player and like the film I'd say it is worth it to double dip, with those colors popping off the screen at 1080p or hearing kidnap the sandy claws and Danny Elfman's score (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305216088">Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>) in the newer sound formats (if your lucky enough to have them).<br /><br />BLU RAY FEATURES (FROM MOVIEWEB)<br />You can watch a Tim Burton classic in 1080p for the first time this August. The Nightmare Before Christmas is coming to Blu-Ray on August 26.

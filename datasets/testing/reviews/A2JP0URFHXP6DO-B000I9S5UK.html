<meta name="summary" content="POOR REMAKE OF A CULT CLASSIC"></head><body><p>In one of the featurettes on the DVD, Star Ethan Hawke claims that this was the best script to an action film he had ever read.  If this was the best that I would hate to see the worst.  This remake of the John Carpenter Cult classic is ridiculous on so many levels.  Suspension of disbelief?  No...how about suspending rational thought and logic as the totally impossible set of circumstances that lead to the siege are among the most far-fetched ever put on film.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburne is a Detroit crime boss named Bishop who is being transported to jail along with the usual cast of two-dimensional action characters including Ja-rule As small-time crook Smiley (don't know why since he never smiles) and John Leguizamo as Beck, a crack head who is on your nerves so quickly that you pray he's killed soon.<br /><br />Well on the way an accident and a fierce winter storm just happens to divert the bus to Precinct 13 which just happens to be closing down and thus just happens to have only a crew of three people and just happens to have all their communications shut down and is evidently in such a remote part of the city that citizens do not hear the thousands of rounds of gunfire and explosions taking place and call the cops.  It may be Detroit, but even that's well beyond normal reason.  Oh and somehow the crooks manage to interfere and knock out the cell phones as well.  That's quite a trick!<br /><br />Soon, some crooked cops led by Gabriel Byrne lead an attack on the precinct in order to kill Bishop before he can expose them at his trial.  Ethan Hawke is Sgt. Jake Roenick, another two-dimensional burned-out cop feeling guilt over two of his partners getting killed in a shootout, eight months earlier.  Along with him is Brian Dennehy who just happens to be retiring, and Drea de Matteo playing her usual smart-mouthed New Yorker...even though she's supposed to be in Detroit. Oh and Maria Bello plays a shrink working with Ethan Hawke who just HAPPENS to get stuck in the storm and has to stay at the precinct as weel. Roenick soon arms his prisoners to fight off the cops.  Seemingly the cops are all former Delta Force members or Navy Seals because they're all armed to the teethe with assault rifles, night vision goggles, and flash grenades.  Yet despite their overwhelming numbers and weaponry, the bad guys find themselves picked off one-by-one.<br /><br />The sad thing is that this could have, and should have been a good film.  But rather than handle the film with some semblance of subtlety, French director Jean-Francois Richet just tries to bludgeon watchers over the head at every moment.  Extremely disappointing.</p></body></html>

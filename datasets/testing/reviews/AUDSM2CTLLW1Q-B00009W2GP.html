<meta name="summary" content="Ultimately, this conclusion disappoints"></head><body><p>The incredible phenomenon of "The Matrix" that hit theaters in 1999 was a landmark film that defined and redefined what we know about science-fiction/action movies and the special effects that can be employed.  The minds behind the madness, the Wachowski brothers, decided to capitalize on the first film's enormous popularity by creating two sequels ("The Matrix: Reloaded" and this one, "The Matrix: Revolutions") to complete a spectacular trilogy.  To avoid the pitfalls of making fans waits ridiculous amounts of time between each sequel (like the "Star Wars" prequels), the Wachowskis decided to film "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" at the same time with the intention of releasing them about a half a year apart ("Lord of the Rings" director, Peter Jackson, employed this same strategy).  Unfortunately, due to onset tragedies and unforeseen delays, the sequels didn't appear until four years after the original, at least a year and a half later than was intended.  Still, the first sequel, "The Matrix: Reloaded", did a credible job of continuing and expanding the story begun in the original.  The meta-philosophical gobble-de-gook didn't bog down that film due to its awe-inspiring and relevant action sequences.  With a bit of a cliffhanger, the table was set for the final part of the trilogy, "The Matrix: Revolutions" to end this saga with a spectacular flourish.  Alas, "Revolutions" turns out to be a mixed bag.  It still provides some awe-inspiring battles, but the discussions get more arcane than in the previous film, and there are some plot developments late in the film that seem to go against everything that has led to this point and create a decidedly unsatisfying and incomplete conclusion.<br /><br />"The Matrix: Reloaded" ended with Neo (Keanu Reaves) trapped somewhere in between the Matrix and human world as the result of using some newfound human powers.  While Neo tries to find his way back to the real world, the humans must still contend with the deadly armada of sentinels still drilling towards Zion in an attempt to exterminate the humans.  After some garbled philosophical discussions, including wasted appearances by Merovingian and Persephone, Neo returns to the real world and a decision is made on what must be done.  After much discussion and arguing, Neo and his lover, Trinity, take one of the human ships to go towards the machines' main city and try and defeat them there, while the remaining humans (such of Morpheus, et al) take the remaining ship and rush back to Zion in an attempt to provide some help during the inevitable battle with the sentinels.  The stage has been set for some truly dramatic developments and, indeed, much of what happens over the next hour is quite compelling and dramatic.  Neo and Trinity's approach to the machine city is a technological marvel.  Much is revealed about the structure and extent of the surface of Earth.  Many miles below the surface the tension of waiting for the sentinel armada is palpable.  Once the battle starts, it becomes a mind-bending sensory assault of images that at once seem to clutter the screen, but never become so indistinct that you cannot tell what is happening.  In terms of technical achievement, the Battle for Zion may be second only to the freeway battle in "Reloaded".<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is more to the movie than this, and the last 30-45 minutes is both ponderous and frustrating.  It is very tempting to reveal the final plot twists so that you can understand the confounding left-turn this film takes, but in the interests of not playing spoiler, I won't.  I will put forth that this does create a decidedly unsatisfying ending, though.  This is truly disappointing, because the "Matrix" trilogy had the potential to completely redefine the definitions of existence and, perhaps, even spawn a new school of philosophical thought.  It just seems as though the Wachowskis got too clever for their own good and the trilogy ends up being less than the some of its parts.  "The Matrix: Revolutions" is not a bad movie.  Its actions sequences are enough to grant it three stars.  However, it is my belief that, in time, the original "Matrix" will be viewed on its own as a truly great film, with two sequels being thought of as frustrating and necessary additions.</p></body></html>

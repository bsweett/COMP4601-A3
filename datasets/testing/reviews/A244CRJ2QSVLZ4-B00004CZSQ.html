<meta name="summary" content="The Three Mothers Trilogy Began With "Suspiria" - A Horror Classic Directed By Dario Argento"></head><body><p>Like myself, many Dario Argento fans have long awaited the American release of "The Mother of Tears."  It is the third installment of the Three Mothers Trilogy.  (At the Toronto International Film Festival, Argento hinted at a fourth film, a prequel.)  The classic horror film, "Suspiria" is the first installment.  Before seeing "The Mother of Tears" for the first time, I wanted to revisit "Suspiria."<br /><br />  First, let me give you some history about the Three Mothers.  In the eleventh century, there were three sisters who were evil witches.  They traveled the world, accumulating great wealth and spreading death.  The oldest one (Mater Suspiriorum or the Mother of Sighs) was Helena Markos; she settled in Germany.  She established a school of witchcraft which the locals condemned.  Helena was killed.  Soon afterwards, the school began teaching ballet instead of witchcraft.<br /><br />  An American student, Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper of "Minority Report"), arrives at the ballet school.  The teachers, she soon discovers, are witches who are viciously murdering anyone, students and faculty, who offend them.<br /><br />  Critics and fans have hailed "Suspiria" as a masterpiece.  Allow me to quickly explain why it remains a favorite of mine.  "Suspiria" is the perfect movie to watch on Halloween.  It is spooky, creepy, and nightmarish.  Filmed in primary colors of blue and red, "Suspiria" has a nightmare quality.  It is obvious that Dario Argento was highly influenced by the Master of the Macabre, Italian film director Mario Bava.  The soundtrack, provided by Goblin, is positively eerie.  The death scenes are some of the most vicious I've ever seen.  The supporting cast is awesome.<br /><br />  Joan Bennett, who portrayed Madame Banc, was a treat to watch.  She is the veteran actress of the daytime soap, "Dark Shadows," which was the essence of gothic.  This soap opera had ghosts, witches, warlocks, vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural creatures of the occult world.  She was a perfect choice for portraying a witch.  The stern, masculine Alida Valli was the perfect choice for the intimidating Miss Tanner, another witch.  She was in Mario Bava's "Lisa and the Devil" and would later act in "Inferno," the sequel to "Suspiria."<br /><br />  While watching "Suspiria," the usage of telekinesis and the fiery climax reminded me of "Carrie."  Also, the witch conspiracy was reminiscent of "Rosemary's Baby."  Both movies are horror classics.  "Suspiria" is also a classic that is required viewing by all horror fans.  Every fan of Dario Argento has seen "Suspiria."  It was the movie that turned me into one of his biggest fans.  I recommend watching it again before seeing "Mother of Tears."</p></body></html>

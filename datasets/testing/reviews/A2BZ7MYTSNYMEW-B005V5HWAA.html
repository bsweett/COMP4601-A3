<meta name="summary" content="Had potential but fell short!"></head><body><p>I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed in this movie. I mean what potential...Demi Moore and Kevin Costner! However, that is where the magic ended. Costner (known as Mr. Brooks) is a successful businessman by day and a serial killer by night. Soon he realizes that during his most recent escapade someone has seen him and "wants to learn how to be a killer". I thought that that was the dumbest thing ever. Someone would see a murder and want to be become a killer. On top of that, Demi Moore is an ambitious, rich detective who is going through a divorce from her "pretty boy" husband. Meanwhile, Mr. Brook's daughter is caught up in troubles of her own, that only add to the mystery. As the tale unfolds, the plot continues to disintergrate into a series of misfortunes. There was potential in the storyline, but it fell short by the end. I thought that the storyline involving Demi Moore and her divorce was stupid, and really added nothing to the storyline, with the exception of a forced plot. If someone has it and wants to loan it to you, see it. Otherwise, save your time and money.</p></body></html>

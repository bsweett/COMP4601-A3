<meta name="summary" content=""Denzel Is Amazing""></head><body><p>Denzel Washington, one of my favorite actors, won his second Academy Award, this one for Best Actor, playing an unscrupulous, evil, demented police officer working the mean streets of Los Angeles. He gets a new partner in the form of Ethan Hawke, a young and innocent new rookie cop who is shocked by his partners unorthadox ways. "Training Day" is fast-paced, involving, and action packed, and just when you think the villin is going to get away with being bad, your vaulted out of your seat. Normally villins in movie history never win Oscars for their portrayals, but Denzel is so convincing you forget any of his other performances, a true mark of a splendid and versatile actor. The DVD set comes with audio commentary, an HBO look behind the scenes of the movie, 2 music videos, alternate ending, and more. The DVD is single layered. Rolling Stone says, "Denzel Washington is a sparking, snapping live wire".</p></body></html>

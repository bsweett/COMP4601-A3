<meta name="summary" content="Under the Stars"></head><body><p>In the realm of the Movies, Kevin Costner is the human repository of all of our collective American Dreams: of all that is Good or Just. He is Everyman.  He is Jim Garrison in "JFK" railing against all the evil in the world in a Texas courtroom in one of the most heartfelt, emotionally effective tour-de-force performances in all of the movies. He is Our modern Gary Cooper. But like all heroes, he is fallible.<br />It is a bold move to make an old-fashioned Western in these times of Crack, Terrorist attacks, AIDS and SARS but Costner, ten years after "Dancing With Wolves" has done so nonetheless.<br />"Open Range" is big and bold and it's vistas are appropriately panoramic yet it is most effective when Costner, Robert Duvall and Annette Bening are on the screen performing their platonic m&eacute;nage a trios: the men all big muddy feet, worn out boots, tied of tongue and Bening, scrubbed free of any makeup, plainly dressed looking radiant, human and womanly, as only she can.<br />There is a plot involving townspeople who want the free-ranging (cattle drivers who let their cattle graze at will) Charley (Costner) and Boss (Duvall) off the town's land and the last 45 minutes of the film is violent, vicious and bloody.<br />But mostly "Open Range" is best when Charley and Boss are on their horses riding the open ranges of America sensing that, being 1882 it's the end of an era, the end of a lifestyle that has brought them a kind of freedom and the end of the innocent world that they have come to love and expect.</p></body></html>

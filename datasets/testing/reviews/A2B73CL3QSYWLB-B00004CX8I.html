<meta name="summary" content="Nicholson Shines (Again)"></head><body><p>This film has a special place in my heart because it was the first film I saw starring Jack Nicholson.  When he first appears on screen here after being uncuffed by the guards, you can feel the whole screen just light up with Jack's burning charisma.  I was determined to seek out after this anything I could with Nicholson because Jack was the man("Goin South", anyone?).  When "Cuckoo's Nest" came out in 1975 Nicholson had already established himself as a star in films.  The only thing that he needed was that shiny gold statuette to validate him as a legend.  Anyone who read Ken Kesey's book on which this was based would agree that Nicholson was born to play R.P. McMurphy.  A rebel stuck in a psychiatric ward would afford Nicholson the opportunity to chew the scenery.  Watching this film again recently I was struck how subdued his performance is here.  Not to be overlooked is Louise Fletcher's performance as the controlling Nurse Ratched.  Her work here is very much the equal of Nicholson's.  The temptation to play this part broadly may have been there, but Fletcher plays her in an understated manner that not so much imbues sympathy for her character but pathos.  The strong supporting cast here includes Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and most effectively Brad Dourif as Billy, an introverted patient who Ratched probably exhibits the most control over.  One weakness of the film is the casting of Chief<br /><br />Bromden, a large deaf and dumb Indian played by Will Sampson.  In Kesey's book, Bromden is the narrator of the story.  The only thing Sampson brings to the part is that he is a big Indian.  Praise also must be given to director Milos Forman, a recent emigre to this country from Czechoslavakia for translating this American story to big screen and to Bo Goldman for adapting Kesey's novel, even though at the time Kesey wasted little time in trashing the film.  On a final note, a few years ago I was fortunate to have seen the stage adaptation of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in New York with Gary Sinise playing McMurphy.  Expecting a re-enactment of the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this production had their own unique interpretation of the material.  As far as Sinise's portrayal, let's just say you would not confuse his interpretation of McMurphy with Jack Nicholson's.</p></body></html>

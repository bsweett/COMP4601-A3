<meta name="summary" content="A Beautiful magical masterpiece, hauntingly familar, incredible."></head><body><p>This movie is visually stunning and it has a heart wrenching familiar story. A little bit in feel of, I'm sorry but I have to say it, Alice in Wonderland. Those are a few of the feelings that I felt while watching this film. I was so drawn into the duality of the story of this film, that it really didn't bother me that it was in Spanish. The story was just so fantastic that I got lost in it. I am torn on the dubbing idea, on one side I hope to be able to enjoy the more visual aspect of the film sets and the characters expressions, etc, instead of reading subtitles; on the other hand there was a certain mystique in that the film was in Spanish. Perhaps to dub it would be like ruining a masterpiece. This movie is not for kids and a lot of reviews have blasted the film for the violence in it. I can accept that there is a story that needs to be told here, and that we can't reduce the horrors of war, or the monstrosities of evil people, just to make ourselves feel safe. I highly recommend this film; it is a story of a fight for freedom in the mind and the fight for freedom in the world.</p></body></html>

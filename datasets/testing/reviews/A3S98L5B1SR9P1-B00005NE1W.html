Night Shamalan does it again with such great direction and an original story line. The story is basically about a guy who soon finds out that he may possess human powers and his ordeals coping with it. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver very powerful performances, so it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen. Like Shamalan's other films this one leaves you in suspense throughout the entire film, and has a surprise ending.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alaska summer's daylight spotlights a guilty conscience"></head><body><p>Al Pacino, cast in the role of an aging Los Angeles detective, is sent to Alaska to solve a murder case.  He's also there to distance himself from an Internal Affairs Investigation going on in which his partner, played by Martin Donovan, is going to testify against him.  The stage is set for conflict, and the Alaskan summer season, where it's daylight all the time, adds to Pacino's fatigue and disorientation as he finds it impossible to sleep.  This is an icy wonderland, and the cinematography is excellent, capturing the unremitting sunshine as a spotlight of sorts on Pacino's past guilty conscience.  He's true to character throughout though, bending the rules for his own purposes.  And when he commits an act that might cast him in an unfavorable light, he again makes concessions to his conscience.  It's a great role and he's a fine actor.<br /><br />Robin Williams is cast as bad guy, an unusual part for him.  He does a good job in the role, as does Hillary Swank as the Alaskan detective working on the case that quickly becomes more and more complex.  Generally, I enjoyed the film.  It's a fast paced drama about a cop and an unsolved mystery.  But although it is done well, it never really rises above its genre.  It held my interest at the time, but I just saw it yesterday, and already I'm beginning to forget it.</p></body></html>

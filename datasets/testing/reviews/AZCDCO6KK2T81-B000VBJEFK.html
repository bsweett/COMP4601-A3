<meta name="summary" content="Great animation, intelligent story, well-acted, but . . ."></head><body><p>The "but" in my headline is the main reason for me giving this movie 3 stars and not 4 or 5 as many have.  I think this latest Pixar film has some serious flaws.  For starters, this film isn't sure who its audience is.  Is it very young kids or older ones?  It isn't geared for teens or adults even though it is very intelligently written and has more of a storyline than others like it.  Disney had this same problem with "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" which kept wildly going back and forth between being a cutsey kids' film and one directed at more "mature" children; however, I did enjoy that film, but it performed less than expected by Disney's standards.<br /><br />My other serious issue with this film is the lack of good, consistent humor.  I, to be frank, found this film to be rather unfunny.  There are long stretches in this movie without any jokes or humor at all.  My youngest child (10) was getting very restless with the film and when the silly stuff came on then my older child (15) yawned and didn't even find the humor humorous (nor did I).  Again, there seems to be a serious lack of direction on this film.  Perhaps they attmepted to appease a too broad of an audience.  A noble but flawed intention with animated films.<br /><br />Another flaw is the lack of a quality soundtrack or score with this film.  It doesn't necessarily need some pop-stars with silly hip lyrics, but the music overall in this film was completely forgettable.  I serious drawback, in my view, for a kid's film.  Heck, I love the soundtrack to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R99F">A Goofy Movie</a> and that was totally directed at young children.<br /><br />On the up side of things the animation is truly outstanding (you can almost count the hairs on the rats for crying out loud).  The script is intelligent, offers a mild, digestible message, and is, overall, rather mature in tone and topic (which shoots over the heads of many little ones).  Finally, the voices are top-notch by all involved.  A special Oscar should go to Peter O'Toole's performance as the self-serving food critic.  In fact, I think it's time we had an additional category for voiceovers in animated features at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />Well, I know I will get ripped for this review as it's hard to criticize a family film without offending someone, but this is my position on this over-rated film, but still somewhat enjoyable summer flick.</p></body></html>

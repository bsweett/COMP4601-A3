Somewhere in the corner of an abandoned laboratory, two scientists, who happened to be a husband and wife (and the man's brother also a scientist working in the same laboratory, as if it was mail-room family business) embarked on a rouge research by inserting human genes into an experimental animal cell line.  You quickly imagine Limbaugh broadcasting that the newly engineered deformed monster engaged in sex with both the man and his wife, killed the man, and got the wife pregnant. The woman scientist is now carrying the new species in her belly, like Adam and Eve in their creation of the Homo sapiens.<br /><br />Off course, there are many scientists who could sell their soul to the devil, but the idea that creating a monster by genetic engineering is both immature and illogical. Even though history proves that genes could make up for all combinations of creatures, from dinosaurs to mosquitoes, the overnight creation of a genetically engineered monster, reared and incarcerated in an abandoned farm, is quite a stretch.  A more probable stretch though is making such monster in a military biological laboratory in a manner that could replace Iron Man in its ability to fly, walk, swim, dive, dodge bullets, and destroy the enemies of the state.<br /><br />The movie however kept me scared, tense, and engaged.  I could imagine the easy slipping into a slippery slope of two motivated scientists who view their scientific mission superseding all state laws and regulations.  It has long been known to scientists that the states are always oppressing to new ideas, since Galileo opposed the belief that the Earth was the center of the universe.</p></body></html>

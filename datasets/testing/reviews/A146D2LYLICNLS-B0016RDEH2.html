Although it wasn't exactly what I had anticipated, I found it intriguing. 1940's post-war Spain as a backdrop for a fairly tale...interesting concept indeed. Overall I think del Toro handled the story quite well, using various atmospheric techniques such as having the "real world" parts of the movie take place at dusk or night, creating a parallel between the fantasy world that Ofelia discovers (also dark and gloomy at all times). However, the transitions from this fantasy world to the real world and vice versa were awkward and didn't quite "fit" in my opinion. Also, I wish the movie spent more time in this fantasy world, as these scenes were simply brilliant in their own surreal way. I do think that del Toro could have exchanged some of the violence for more of the fantasy element.<br /><br />Also impressive are the performances by the entire cast, but especially Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia. I found myself rooting for her, and genuinely heartbroken at the end (won't spoil the ending). There is definitely a lot going on underneath the surface of this film, which makes it demand repeated viewings.<br /><br />Although I see that other reviewers have already mentioned this, I'll repeat that this is NOT a children's movie. There is quite a lot of aforementioned violence, a scene of implicit torture, and the f-word a few times. Any parent expecting to see a "Harry Potter"-like film is in for a rude awakening, as will any child who sees this. Then again, the "R" rating should already raise a red flag for any parent in the first place.<br /><br />But all in all, definitely recommended.</p></body></html>

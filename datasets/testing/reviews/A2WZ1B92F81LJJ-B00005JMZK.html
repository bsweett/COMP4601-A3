<meta name="summary" content="Whoever wins ... *WE* lose"></head><body><p>As long as *we* is construed as referring to the hapless cinema-going public, then you have to give the promoters of this witless film credit for at least being honest.<br /><br />For the huge problem this film has (leaving aside small matters such as a lousy script, complete lack of originality etc.) is precisely the point that the tag line - wrongly - addresses: No matter who wins, we (the human race, that is) WIN. For surely it would be better to have just one set of genocidal bad guys roaming the antarctic wastes, and not two.<br /><br />As they're slugging away at each other *we* just don't care a jot who wins. As is evidenced by the box office returns on this turkey.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Non-Rap Fan's Comment; This Is Surprisingly Good!"></head><body><p>As many people have already said in their positive reviews, "8 Mile" is really a surprisingly good film, both gritty and truthful.  I know and you know that the film is NOT exactly what happened to Eminem, a now celebrated rapper with strong messages.  The film is a gentler and softer version of his real life, but thanks to the sure hand of director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential fame), the total result is more than satisfactory.  And yes, though basically 'as himself', he can act pretty good.<p>'8 Mile' is a real place in Detroit where Eminem is raised, and here stands as a symbol of the borderline where two kinds of people meet.  Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers III) plays his alter ego Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith, who struggles to make it in rap music where black people are dominant.  But at the crutial moment during the amateur contest for rappers (the battle, they call it), his tongue which should be always acid fails him.<p>Then the film follows the life of Jimmy and his friends, and how he finds the way he should live his life in spite of his messy surroundings including his girlfriend (Brittany Murphey) and his mother (Kim Basinger).  The final scenes, even for the audiences like me who don't know much about rap music, are very exciting and rousing.  In fact we come to like this guy Jimmy.<p>For his avid fans, the film may look too tame, but you have to admit that film is made for wider audience in mind.  Jimmy has a sister, but fans might instead remember his (Eminem's) own daughter when looking at her.  But forget those things outside the screen for a while.  This is a story about an angry man who doesn't know into what kind of shapes he should turn the enormous anger.<p>The film has very authentic atmosphere of Detroit, and does not fail to reflect the social background of the characters.  But as I said, we should watch this one as a story with universal appeal.  If you don't like hip-hop or rap, never mind.  You just don't have to.  Because "8 Mile" has vast power to make you understand why he is so popular among his fans.</p></body></html>

Kidman does a wonderful job as the interpreter, she is beautiful and believable.  We believe she is frightened, but Penn seems to be sleepwalking through the role of Keller.  Hello?  Somebody smack him awake, this beautiful woman's life's in danger!!<br /><br />I was really disappointed in Sean Penn's performance.  He failed to pull out some real emotion and compelling character.  He's not even believable as the grieving widower.<br /><br />Sadly, a forgettable film. Kidman's performance was wasted.  No action, slow pace, needed more suspense, a car chase, or something.  I've seen episodes of Fox's '24' that were more of a thrill!  The bus scene was THE highlight of the film.  The Interpreter is surely not in the class of "Three Days of the Condor", "Ronin", or even "Bourne Identity".</p></body></html>

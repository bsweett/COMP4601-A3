<meta name="summary" content="Culture clash"></head><body><p>This movie starts out with the college application to Princeton by a young Hispanic girl who is writing about the most influential person in her life--her mother (Paz Vega).  She relates the story of how her mother was hired to be a housekeepr by a neurotic Anglo woman (Tea Leoni)who demeaned her daughter for being overweight and who did not appreciate her long-suffering husband (Adam Sandler).  Paz's warm and accepting manner wins over both Sandler and his daughter, but does not endear her to Leoni, who spoils Vega's daughter with outings she does not have permission to take.  This movie touches on issues of race and social class, and has surprising depth.  As many of the other reviewers, I expected this to be a shallow comedy, but I was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking content.</p></body></html>

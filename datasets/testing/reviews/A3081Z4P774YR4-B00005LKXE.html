<meta name="summary" content="A Rather Dark Little Tale"></head><body><p>This is one of those films that is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. As it goes, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is not in the best of places when she is put back on the investigation to find killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). This is all part of the machinations of the only survivor of Lecter's attacks, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, in a truly twisted performance) who wants nothing less than to use Lecter for pig food. Sure I can carp about the slight lapses in suspense (moreso when we leave the Italy sequences behind), the ending (not the &quot;dinner&quot; scene, but after that), and to some degree, the charcterization of certain characters. The thing is though, I still get wrapped up in the sick absurbity of it all. Visually, this film is just stunning (especially during the time in Italy), the music is quite beautiful (such as in the opera sequence), and even chilling in some places, like an eerie flashback involving Verger and his reason for wanting Hannibal Lecter dead (and to The Blue Danube, no less). Is it a good movie? The answer depends on what you expect from &quot;Hannibal&quot;. If you expect a straight forward thriller, at least you have a copy of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, right? If you expect a dark, gore-drenched little melodrama, then by all means, dig in.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Milla, Milla, Milla ..."></head><body><p>I guess there's a guilty pleasure wrapped up here somewhere in ULTRAVIOLET, a bloated video-gamer's paradise of a movie with action sequences quite possibly choreographed by Maybelline in order to provide the most subtle, haunting, and pristine glances at the features of Milla Jovovich.  All kidding aside, she is quite stunning to look at.<br /><br />The plot -- not that one matters! -- is inconsequential here.  All the film is shuttles between excuses to get from each action set piece to the next compliments of plenty of obvious CGI.  Don't get me wrong!  When it's action, it's quite pretty ... arguably as pretty as is the film's lead.  It's Milla fighting, Milla shooting, Milla on a motorcycle, Milla swinging a samurai sword ... so many bodies, so little time (7 minutes longer than the theatrical cut for those of you keeping track).<br /><br />In a film where the science is largely unexplained and sacrificed to the world of magic (Violet has a mystical belt buckle that not only allows her to ignore the law of gravity but also anything she's riding, too!), what matters is that it all look pretty, and, on that level, I guess it's safe to conclude that the package is delivered.  While she's young and in shape, Ms. Jovovich can make flicks like this around the clock, and she'll always have SOME audience ... once the movie ends, they'll all head back home to their XBoxes.<br /><br />I will say this: there's no doubt in my mind that whatever ULTRAVIOLET is based on -- a graphic novel, a video game, or something less three-dimensional -- it's probably quite better than this stinker of a story.</p></body></html>

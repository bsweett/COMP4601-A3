<meta name="summary" content="So dark the con of man...so not bad a movie adaptation"></head><body><p>I couldn't get away from The DaVinci Code even when in Japan.  The paperback edition were on display at bookstores everywhere and there were posters for the movies on the pillars of Tokyo's subway station.  Upon returning home, I forced myself to read the book before taking a gander at the movie.<br /><br />For those sheltered from the realms of pop culture (which may not be a bad idea):  while giving a lecture on symbols in Paris, Dr. Robert Langdon, a professor is enlisted in aiding the police in the murder of Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, who has been found dead a la DaVinci's Vitruvian Man or Canon of Proportions.  Sauniere also wrote a cryptic message that Bezu Fache, the DCPJ (Direction Centrale Police Judiciare) officer in charge of the investigation, wants Langdon to find out.  Langdon finds an ally in DCPJ  cryptologist Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of the murdered, with whom she has not been in contact for a long time.  The duo are on the run, as Fache has already pegged Langdon as the murder suspect.  Another party, in the form of the menacing albino monk Silas, under the guidance of Bishop Aringarosa of extreme Catholic organization Opus Dei and a mysterious person known as the Teacher, is also after our heroes.  He takes an extreme form of Christianity, flogging himself and even wearing a spiked discipline belt (cilice) around his leg.<br /><br />While comparisons have been made to Raiders of the Lost Ark (the quest for the Holy Grail), the DaVinci Code is more a thinking movie given the codes Langdon and Sophie have to decipher, and the wily intellect of Jacques Sauniere is demonstrated time and time again with each clue solved, be it through anagrams, codes, or Fibonacci numbers.  Langdon and Neveu follow clue after clue, from the Louvre, to a Swiss bank account, to the Templar's church in England.  They also get help from Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric British Grail historian whose passionate and enthused performance by Ian McKellen makes for one of the greatest moments in the movie.  It's gratifying to see heroes and characters whose chief assets are their brains, not whether they can kick a 50 ft steel wall down and kickbox their way through 50 bad guys dressed in black in a digital blur.<br /><br />Tom Hanks does a competent job as Langdon, though check out that hairdo!  I was initially disgruntled upon hearing Audrey Tautou (Sophie) costarring.  She's finally sold out, I thought, but after seeing her competent and likeable character plus a glimpse of that smile I remember from Amelie, much of my rancor evaporated.  And since going Hollywood, poor Jean Reno (Fache) seems relegated to second banana roles as the token French official--remember The Pink Panther.<br /><br />The controversy that set the Vatican abuzz is nothing new--q.v. The Last Temptation of Christ, which somewhat dwells on the same theme.  But it does make a point of how history and thus truth is a commodity created by the winners, at the cost of keeping the real truth hidden from the rest of the world, often innocent lives.  The historical flashbacks demonstrating the holocaust perpetuated against freethinking women burned as witches and the hunting down of the Templars by the Church exemplify that.  In Langdon's lecture, we see how Poseidon's trident is turned into the devil's pitchfork and how Mary nursing Jesus was taken from a representation of Isis nursing Horus, basically how Christianity was founded on distortions, appropriations, and suppressing concepts from pagan religion--we have Emperor Constantine to thank for that at the Council of Nicaea.  So dark the con of man indeed.<br /><br />Being a somewhat harsh judge when it comes to movies based on novels, there was quite a bit of material excised from the movie, but 85% of the book was there, so given today's shoddy standards, not bad.  Granted, there are some extraneous stuff in the movie not in the book--the scene at the park where Sophie pays 50 euros to the drug addict to have the park bench to herself and Langdon.  The book's better, obviously, but as movie adaptations go, a hand to director Ron Howard.</p></body></html>

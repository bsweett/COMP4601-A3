What should be known is that DeNiro laid an egg here, a really rotten one. Local hero Matt Damon  pays the ultiimate price-totally miscast as the CIA rising star,who's ascent adversely affects his demeanor,marriage and family.How many trillion men in history could say/have said the same thing? The entire "production" is entirely too long, tedious,boring. And, again, it's becoming obvious to this reviewer that if Damon is playing a role that seems to be a part of himself-see "Rounders", "Good Will Hunting", the "Bourne" series etc,-then he's very good. Otherwise, he's typically as useful as Wally Cox would have been playing "Patton"! One positive point: the movie IS marginally better than "Ski Party".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tragedy that leads to personal discovery"></head><body><p>"The Descendants" is a comedy-drama genre film where the lives of the King family is shoved into a state of disarray following the critical injury of Elizabeth King, who is the wife of Matt (George Clooney) and mother to Alex and Scottie.<br /><br />The tragedy of Elizabeth's injury brings the King family together, and suddenly Matt has to urgently reassess his priorities. Despite their mother's injury the children like any youths are experiencing a confusing stage in their lives and Matt is forced to find caring and leadership skills, which he for years has avoided. Matt already has his hands full as the sole trustee of a family trust, which has ownership of 25,000 pristine acres of land on the island of Kaua'i, and also his normal job as a lawyer.<br /><br />The narrative is very much focused on a collective path of discovery and transition for Matt King and his daughters, which is at times tragic, humorous, and satisfying for the viewer. Matt's ultimate decision regarding the family trust is influenced by his grief experience, but more so by the clarity he receives after assessing his life.<br /><br />George Clooney provides a solid performance as Matt King with a convincing screen presence, and the entire cast present as unique and interesting characters.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

<meta name="summary" content=""The truth is, I am Iron Man.""></head><body><p>Get ready to be entertained folks! I was preparing myself to be somewhat disappointed. After all, many of the comic books transformed to films have a history of sucking hard, but Iron Man comes through with a finely adapted screenplay, top notch action, not to mention a great cast. ILM again comes through with the best CGI money can buy, this time with a winner of film for a change. It also looks as if Robert Downey Jr. (an actor I had always liked) is back in his game. His unfortunate downward spiral in the mid 90's up through the last several years nearly destroyed his acting career. I hope this time around, he's here to stay.<br /><br />So, getting to the "main course" Tony Stark is a billionaire engineer genius/philanthropist and has  been compared to the likes of Leonardo Davinci. His inherited genius comes from his father who started it all designing weapons for the military where he picked up and designed some of the worlds most destructive weapons of war.During one of his excursions and promotional gigs to "sell" his new "bang, bang" toy, he is kidnapped during an ambush where he is forced to make the same weapon for "the enemy" that will be used on theirs. Stark decides to do something else, and in of all places, makes his greatest creation to free himself from captivity...."the suite" which is a crude form of what will be his masterpiece.<br /><br />Upon his escape and back home, he has an epiphany. Instead of making weapons of death and destruction for the military, he wants to design things to help mankind and put an end to war. This does not settle well with his business partner Obadiah, played by the excellent Jeff Bridges who has "alternate" plans. There he designs the suit of all suits through trial an error to put a stop to his weapons being sold and placed in the wrong hands and defend those who need it the most. This immediately put him in the wrong cross hairs of everyone. Soon Obadiah discovers what Stark has created and copies his suit design, only far more destructive and menacing.<br /><br />Well worth watching, Iron Man finishes SOLID. Downey 's character has some great lines and lots of dry, sarcastic and quirky humor. It keeps a good flow through the entire film from start to finish. Of course in this day an age in film making, Iron Man finishes with the hint (and most likely the promise) of continuing stories to come in the future. Well worth seeing for the theater experience, this is not one to miss folks. Saddle up for some hard hitting action and a bitch'in good time.</p></body></html>

Clocking in at nearly four hours, the film recounts the British campaign in the Middle East as seen through the eyes of famed British officer, T.E Lawrence. Lawrence Of Arabia is a stunning picture with a terrific sense of atmosphere. Director David Lean's direction is flawless and everything about this film is epic. The acting, the score, the scenery, everything is grand. T.E Lawrence is brilliantly portrayed by Peter O'toole and he is definitely the right person for the role. The film is a visual treat as the color palette for the film is mostly beige, but the desert is beautifully filmed, and I would go as far as to say that desert is a character in the film. Lawrence Of Arabia is a beautifully photographed picture and is superbly acted. Director David Lean has crafted a true masterpiece of a film, and though quite long, watching the film is definitely worth it. The cast assembled do a great job on screen, and aside from Peter O'Toole I thought the best actor in this film was Alec Guinness. Lawrence of Arabia is a sweeping epic that remains a cinematic masterwork. The power and grandeur of the film speaks for itself. For people interested in the subject of T.E Lawrence and his legendary campaign, Lawrence Of Arabia is a great film to watch, and for those who enjoy classic epics, this is a must see.</p></body></html>
